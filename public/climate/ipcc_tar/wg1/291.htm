        Figure 7.5:</b> Schematic showing relationships between a simulation of 
        the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL), a Land-Surface Parametrization (LSP), 
        vegetation and soil properties, and anthropogenic change. Interactions 
        are shown by broad white arrows marked with capital letters, fluxes by 
        grey arrows, and dependencies by dotted lines. (A) Diurnal-seasonal interactions 
        between the ABL and the LSP; the ABL variables of air temperature, humidity,

        ,L<img src="images/d_arr.gif" width="5" height="8"> , u, P) are used to 
        force the LSP which calculates net radiation minus ground heat, sensible 
        heat, and latent heat fluxes ( R<sub>n</sub> -G, H, <font face="Symbol">l</font>E), 
        which in turn feed back to the atmosphere. Three surface parameters in 
        the LSP are critical to these calculations: Albedo and surface roughness 
        (<font face="Symbol">a</font>,Z<sub>0</sub> ) determine the radiative 
        balance and turbulent exchange regime, and in third generation LSPs, the 
        canopy conductance term, g<sub>c</sub> (equivalent to the summation of 
        all the leaf stomatal conductances) determines the vegetation evapotranspiration 
        rate (<font face="Symbol">l</font>E) and net photosynthetic rate (P<sub>net</sub> 
        ). On time-scales of minutes to hours, g<sub>c</sub> is a direct function 
        of T, q, S<img src="images/d_arr.gif" width="5" height="8"> ,CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentration and soil moisture (W). Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
        can act to signifi-cantly reduce gc and hence limit <font face="Symbol">l</font>E. 
        The maximum value of g<sub>c</sub> is determined by parameters related 
        to vegetation density or leaf area index (LAI), and biochemical capacity 
        (V<sub>max</sub> ). Long-term climatic forcing (B) and land-use change 
        (C) can alter the vegetation type and density, soil properties and ecosystem 
        respiration rates, R<sub>d</sub> , by which carbon is returned to the 
        atmosphere from the vegetation and soil. (D) Changes in vegetation properties 
        affect V<sub>max</sub> and LAI, and changes in soil properties affect 
        soil moisture (W) and runoff (R<sub>0</sub> ).</i></p>

<p><a name="fig75"></a>Climate and carbon cycle simulations extending over more 
  than a few decades must take account of land-surface change for two main reasons. 
  First, changes in the physical character of the land surface can affect land-atmosphere 
  exchanges of radiation, momentum, heat and water (see <a href="#fig75">Figure 
  7.5</a> and the simulation studies discussed below). These effects must be allowed 
  for within climate simulations or analyses to avoid confusion with the effects 
  of global warming. Second, changes in vegetation type, density and associated 
  soil properties usually lead to changes in terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes 
  that can then directly contribute to the evolution of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration. Therefore, any historical analysis of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  record must estimate these contributions to avoid inaccurate attribution of 
  carbon sinks or sources. Similarly, model simulations extending over the next 
  50 to 100 years should allow for significant perturbations to the atmospheric 
  carbon budget from changes in terrestrial ecosystems (Woodwell et al., 1998; 
  see also <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<p> There are two types of land-surface change; direct anthropogenic change, such 
  as deforestation and agriculture; and indirect change, where changes in climate 
  or CO<sub>2</sub> concentration force changes in vegetation structure and function within 
  biomes, or the migration of biomes themselves. With respect to direct anthropogenic 
  change, population growth in the developing countries and the demand for economic 
  development worldwide has led to regional scale changes in vegetation type, 
  vegetation fraction and soil properties (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1996; Ramankutty 
  and Foley, 1998). Such changes can now be continuously monitored from space, 
  and the satellite data record extends back to 1973. Large-scale deforestation 
  in the humid tropics (South America, Africa and Southeast Asia) has been identified 
  as an important ongoing process, and its possible impact on climate has been 
  the topic of several field campaigns (Gash et al., 1996), and modelling studies 
  (for example, Nobre et al., 1991; Lean et al., 1996; Xue and Shukla, 1996; Zhang 
  et al., 1996a; Hahmann and Dickinson, 1997; Lean and Rowntree, 1997). Some significant 
  extra-tropical impacts have also been identified in several model experiments 
  (e.g., Sud et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1996b). Replacement of tropical forest 
  by degraded pasture has been observed to reduce evaporation, and increase surface 
  temperature; these effects are qualitatively reproduced by most models. However, 
  large uncertainties still persist about the impact of large-scale deforestation 
  on the hydrological cycle over the Amazon in particular. Some numerical studies 
  point to a reduction of moisture convergence while others tend to increase the 
  inflow of moisture into the region. This lack of agreement occurs during the 
  rainy season and reflects our poor understanding of the interaction of convection 
  and land-surface processes (Polcher, 1995; Zhang et al., 1997a), in addition 
  to the effects of differences between the formulations in the land-surface schemes, 
  their parameter fields, and the host GCMs used in the studies.</p>
<p> Other simulation work has indicated that the progressive cultivation of large 
  areas in the East and Midwest USA over the last century may have induced a regional 
  cooling of the order of 1 to 2&deg;C due to enhanced evapotranspiration rates 
  and increased winter albedo (Bonan, 1999). Snow-vegetation albedo effects significantly 
  influence the near-surface climate; assignment of an open snow albedo value 
  to the winter boreal forest in an NWP led to the prediction of air temperatures 
  that were 5 to 10&deg;C too low over large areas of Canada (Betts et al., 1998). 
  Work has also been done on the interaction between Sahelian vegetation and rainfall 
  that suggests that the persistent rainfall anomaly observed there in the 1970s 
  and 1980s could be related to land-surface changes (Claussen, 1997; Xue, 1997). 
  All these studies indicate that large-scale land-use changes can lead to significant 
  regional climatic impacts. However, it is unlikely that the aggregate of realistic 
  land-use changes over the next 50 to 100 years will contribute to global scale 
  climate changes comparable to those resulting from the warming associated with 
  the continuing increase in greenhouse gases. </p>
<p> Changes to the land surface resulting from climate change or increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration are likely to become important over the mid- to long term. For 
  example, the extension of the growing season in high latitudes (Myneni et al., 
  1997) will probably result in increases in biomass density, biogeochemical cycling 
  rates, photosynthesis, respiration and fire frequency in the northern forests, 
  leading to significant changes in albedo, evapotranspiration, hydrology and 
  the carbon balance of the zone (Bonan et al., 1992; Thomas and Rowntree, 1992; 
  Levis et al., 1999). There have been several attempts to calculate patterns 
  of vegetation type and density as a function of climate (e.g., Zeng et al., 
  1999); most of these have made use of climate predictions to calculate the future 
  steady-state distribution of terrestrial biomes but some have attempted to model 
  transitional cases (Ciret and Henderson-Sellers, 1998).</p>
<p> However, over the next 50 to 100 years, it is more likely that changes in 
  vegetation density and soil properties within existing biome borders will make 
  a greater contribution to modifying physical climate system and carbon cycle 
  processes than any large-scale biogeographical shifts. In some cases, soil physical 
  and chemical properties will limit the rate at which biomes can "migrate"; 
  for example, colonisation of the tundra by boreal forest species is likely to 
  be slowed by the lack of soil. Climate-vegetation relations are discussed further 
  in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="324.htm">Section 8.5.5</a> with 
  respect to past climates.</p>
<p> At present, only limited global data sets for LSPs are available and these 
  need to be further improved. A comprehensive land-use/land cover data set, providing 
  a global time-series of vegetation and soil parameters over the last two centuries 
  at GCM resolution, would be a very useful tool to separate land-use change impacts 
  on regional climate from global scale warming effects. Additionally, for both 
  historical analyses and future projections, there is a need for interactive 
  vegetation models that can simulate changes in vegetation parameters and carbon 
  cycle variables in response to climate change. These proposed fourth generation 
  models are just beginning to be designed and implemented within climate models.
