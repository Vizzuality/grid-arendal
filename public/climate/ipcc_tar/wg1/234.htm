<h3>6.7.4 Fossil Fuel Organic Carbon Aerosol</h3>
<p>Anthropogenic organic aerosols are a by-product of fossil fuel and biomass 
  combustion and they consist of many complex chemical compounds and are released 
  either as primary aerosol particles or as volatile organic gases (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>). Studies that investigate the radiative forcing due to organic carbon 
  (OC) from fossil fuels are included in Table 6.5. Penner et al. (1998b) and 
  Grant et al. (1999) found a DRF of +0.16 Wm<sup>-2</sup> when modelling the 
  direct radiative forcing due to an internal mixture of fossil fuel BC and OC, 
  and +0.2Wm<sup>-2</sup> when modelling the radiative forcing due to externally 
  mixed fossil fuel BC. From these results, an annual global mean radiative forcing 
  of -0.04 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel OC from a global mean burden of approximately 
  0.7 mgm<sup>-2</sup> may be derived. However, if OC were modelled as an external 
  mixture with BC and/or if the effects of relative humidity are included, the 
  radiative forcing due to OC from fossil fuels is likely to be more negative, 
  thus this represents an approximate weakest limit. An alternative method for 
  calculating the DRF due to fossil fuel OC from the results of Penner et al. 
  (1998b) is to note that the absorption is approximately doubled when BC is modelled 
  as an internal mixture rather than an external mixture (e.g., Haywood et al., 
  1997a). Thus, for an external mixture of fossil fuel OC a radiative forcing 
  of -0.24 Wm<sup>-2</sup> may be more appropriate. Cooke et al. (1999) performed 
  GCM calculations for externally mixed fossil fuel OC, finding a radiative forcing 
  of -0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from a global mean burden of 0.34 mgm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  Myhre et al. (2001) scale the atmospheric concentrations of fossil fuel OC to 
  modelled sulphate aerosol concentrations and include the effects of relative 
  humidity to estimate a radiative forcing of -0.09 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from a global 
  mean burden of 0.66 mgm<sup>-2</sup>. Thus, modelling estimates suggest that 
  the normalised radiative forcing for OC is in the range -60 to -340 Wg<sup>-1</sup>, 
  which is smaller in magnitude than that due to BC due to the larger specific 
  extinction coefficient for BC and the fact that BC may exert a significant radiative 
  forcing in cloudy regions. Cooke et al. (1999) assume that OC is partially absorbing 
  with a modelled single scattering albedo of approximately 0.97 at a wavelength 
  of 0.55 &micro;m. Hansen et al. (1998) use a three-dimensional GCM and the OC 
  distribution from Liousse et al. (1996) and estimate the radiative forcing due 
  to combined fossil fuel and biomass sources to be -0.41 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The 
  approximate fraction of the atmospheric burden of the fossil fuel component 
  may be estimated from the emission inventory of Liousse et al. (1996) who estimate 
  that fossil fuels contribute 38% to the total OC emissions. Thus the radiative 
  forcing due to fossil fuel OC may be inferred to be approximately -0.16 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  This may constitute an approximate upper estimate as the majority of fossil 
  fuel OC occurs over mid-latitude land areas where the surface reflectance is 
  generally higher and insolation is lower than in the equatorial regions where 
  biomass burning is the major source of OC. From these calculations, the radiative 
  forcing due to fossil fuel OC is estimated to be -0.10 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The 
  uncertainty associated with this estimate is necessarily high due to the limited 
  number of detailed studies and is estimated to be at least a factor of three.</p>
