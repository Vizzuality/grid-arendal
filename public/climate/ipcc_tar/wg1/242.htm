<h3>6.8.5 Forcing Estimates for This Report</h3>
<p>Shine and Forster (1999) proposed a value of the aerosol indirect forcing due 
  to all aerosols of -1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with at least a factor of two uncertainty. 
  Several observational studies (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>) support 
  the existence of the first aerosol indirect effect on low-level clouds and a 
  negative sign for the associated radiative forcing, but these studies do not 
  give indications on what a (negative) upper bound of the forcing would be. GCM 
  studies predict radiative forcing for the first indirect effect of industrial 
  aerosols in the range of -0.3 to -1.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. However, because 
  of the uncertainties in the estimates discussed above, the limited validation 
  of GCM parametrizations and results, and because in-cloud absorption by black 
  carbon aerosols was not considered in all but one of the GCM studies, we retain 
  0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> as an upper bound for the first aerosol indirect effect. A 
  lower bound of -2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is selected on the basis of available 
  GCM studies for the first indirect effect. Not too much emphasis should be given 
  to the exact bounds of this interval because they do not carry any statistical 
  meaning (<a href="251.htm#6131">Section 6.13.1</a>) and because of the very 
  low level of scientific understanding associated to this forcing (see <a href="251.htm#6131">Section 
  6.13.1</a> where this concept is defined).</p>
<p>Available GCM studies suggest that the radiative flux perturbations associated 
  with the second effect could be of similar magnitude to that of the first effect. 
  There are no studies yet to confirm unambiguously that the GCM estimates of 
  the radiative impact associated with the second indirect effect can be interpreted 
  in the strict sense of a radiative forcing (see <a href="214.htm">Sections 6.1</a> 
  and <a href="239.htm">6.8.2.2</a>), and very few observations exist as yet to 
  support the existence of a significant effect. Therefore we refrain from giving 
  any estimate or range of estimates for the second aerosol indirect effect. However, 
  this does not minimise the potential importance of this effect.</p>
<h3><a name="686"></a>6.8.6 Aerosol Indirect Effect on Ice Clouds</h3>
<h4><a name="6861"></a>6.8.6.1 Contrails and contrail-induced cloudiness</h4>
<p>Using meteorological and air traffic data scaled to regional observations of 
  contrail cover, Sausen et al. (1998) estimated the present day global mean cover 
  by line-shaped contrails to be about 0.1%. This results in a global and annual 
  mean radiative forcing by line-shaped contrails of 0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (Minnis et al., 
  1999), subject to uncertainties in the contrail cover, optical depth, ice particle 
  size and shape (Meerk&ouml;tter et al., 1999). We follow Fahey et al. (1999) 
  and retain a range of 0.005 to 0.06 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the present day forcing, around 
  the best estimate of 0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
<p>Contrails can evolve into extended cirrus clouds. Boucher (1999) and Fahey 
  et al. (1999) have shown evidences that cirrus occurrence and coverage may have 
  increased in regions of high air traffic compared with the rest of the globe. 
  Smith et al. (1998) reported the existence of nearly invisible layers of small 
  ice crystals, which cause absorption of infrared radiation, and could be due 
  to remnant contrail particles. From consideration of the spatial distribution 
  of cirrus trends during the last 25 years, Fahey et al. (1999) gave a range 
  of possible best estimates of 0 to 0.04 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the radiative forcing due to 
  aviation-induced cirrus. The available information on cirrus clouds was deemed 
  insufficient to determine a single best estimate or an uncertainty range.</p>
<h4><a name="6862"></a>6.8.6.2 Impact of anthropogenic aerosols on cirrus cloud 
  microphysics</h4>
<p>Measurements by Str&ouml;m and Ohlsson (1998) in a region of high air traffic 
  revealed higher crystal number concentrations in areas of the cloud affected 
  by soot emissions from aircraft. If the observed enhancement in crystal number 
  density (which is about a factor of 2) is associated with a reduction in the 
  mean crystal size, as confirmed by the measurements of Kristensson et al. (2000), 
  a change in cloud radiative forcing may result. Wyser and Str&ouml;m (1998) 
  estimated the forcing, although very uncertain, to be in the order of 0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  in regions of dense air traffic under the assumption of a 20% decrease of the 
  mean crystal size. No globally averaged radiative forcing is available.</p>
<p>The sedimentation of ice particles from contrails may remove water vapour from 
  the upper troposphere. This effect is expected to be more important in strongly 
  supersaturated air when ice particles can fall without evaporating (Fahey et 
  al., 1999). The impacts of such an effect on cirrus formation, vertical profile 
  of humidity and the subsequent radiative forcing have not been assessed.</p>
<p>Aerosols also serve as ice nuclei although it is well recognised that there 
  are fewer ice nuclei than cloud condensation nuclei. It is conceivable that 
  anthropogenic aerosols emitted at the surface and transported to the upper troposphere 
  affect the formation and properties of ice clouds. Jensen and Toon (1997) suggested 
  that insoluble particles from the surface or soot particles emitted by aircraft, 
  if they serve as effective ice nuclei, can result in an increase in the cirrus 
  cloud coverage. Laaksonen et al. (1997) argued that nitric acid pollution is 
  able to cause an increase in supercooled cirrus cloud droplet concentrations, 
  and thereby influence climate (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="186.htm">Section 
  5.3.6</a>). Such effects, if significant at all, are not quantified at present.</p>
