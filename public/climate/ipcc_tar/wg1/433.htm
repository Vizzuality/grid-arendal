<h3>11.5.3 Implications for Coastal Regions </h3>
<p>To determine the practical consequences of projections of global sea level 
  rise in particular coastal regions, it is necessary to understand the various 
  components leading to relative sea level changes. These components include local 
  land movements, global eustatic sea level rise, any spatial variability from 
  that global average, local meteorological changes and changes in the frequency 
  of extreme events. </p>
<h4><a name="11531"></a>11.5.3.1 Mean sea level</h4>
<p>Titus and Narayanan (1996) propose a simple method for computing local projections 
  of mean sea level rise given historical observations at a site and projections 
  of global average sea level (such as <a href="429.htm#fig1112">Figure 11.12</a>). 
  To allow for local land movements and our current inability to model sea level 
  change accurately (<a href="428.htm">Section 11.4</a>), they propose linearly 
  extrapolating the historical record and adding to this a globally averaged projection. 
  However, they point out that to avoid double counting, it is necessary to correct 
  the global projection for the corresponding modelled trend of sea level rise 
  during the period of the historical observations. Caution is required in applying 
  this method directly to the projections of this chapter for several reasons. 
  First, current model projections indicate substantial spatial variability in 
  sea level rise. This variability has a standard deviation of up to 0.1 m by 
  2100; some locations experience a sea level rise of more than twice the global-average 
  thermal expansion, while others may have a fall in sea level (<a href="432.htm#1152">Section 
  11.5.2</a>; <a href="430.htm#tab1115">Table 11.15</a>). Second, there are uncertainties 
  in the accuracy of the trend from the historical record and in modelling of 
  past sea level changes (<a href="424.htm#11321">Sections 11.3.2.1</a> and <a href="428.htm">11.4</a>). 
  Third, as well as changes in mean sea level there may be changes in the local 
  meteorological regime resulting in modified storm surge statistics (<a href="433.htm#11532">Section 
  11.5.3.2</a>). If the method of Titus and Narayanan is not applied, it is nonetheless 
  important to recognise that in all models and scenarios the rate of local sea 
  level rise in the 21st century is projected to be greater than in the 20th century 
  at the great majority of coastal locations.</p>
<h4><a name="11532"></a>11.5.3.2 Extremes of sea level: storm surges and waves 
</h4>
<p>The probability of flood risk in coastal areas is generally expressed in terms 
  of extreme sea level distributions. Such distributions are usually computed 
  from observed annual maximum sea levels from several decades of tide gauge data, 
  or from numerical models. While such distributions are readily available for 
  many locations, a worldwide set has never been computed to common standards 
  for studies of impacts of global sea level change. </p>
<p>Changes in the highest sea levels at a given locality could result mainly from 
  two effects. First, if mean sea level rises, the present extreme levels will 
  be attained more frequently, all else being equal. This may imply a significant 
  increase in the area threatened with inundation (e.g., Hubbert and McInnes, 
  1999) and an increased risk within the existing flood plain. The effect can 
  be estimated from a knowledge of the present day frequency of occurrence of 
  extreme levels (e.g., Flather and Khandker, 1993; Lowe et al., 2001; <a href="430.htm#fig1114">Figure 
  11.14</a>). </p>
<p>Second, changes in storm surge heights would result from alterations to the 
  occurrence of strong winds and low pressures. At low-latitude locations, such 
  as the Bay of Bengal, northern Australia and the southern USA, tropical cyclones 
  are the primary cause of storm surges. Changes in frequency and intensity of 
  tropical cyclones could result from alterations to sea surface temperature, 
  large-scale atmospheric circulation and the characteristics of ENSO (Pittock 
  et al., 1996) but no consensus has yet emerged (see <a href="388.htm#box102">Box 
  10.2</a>). In other places, such as southern Australia and north-west Europe, 
  storm surges are associated with mid-latitude low-pressure systems. For instance, 
  Hubbert and McInnes (1999) showed that increasing the wind speeds in historical 
  storm surge events associated with the passage of cold fronts could lead to 
  greater flooding in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. Changes in extratropical 
  storms also cannot be predicted with confidence (<a href="366.htm">Section 9.3.6.3</a>).</p>
<p>Several studies have attempted to quantify the consequences of changes in storm 
  climatology for the north-west European continental shelf using regional models 
  of the atmosphere and ocean. Using five-year integrations of the ECHAM T106 
  model for present and doubled CO<sub>2</sub>, Von Storch and Reichardt (1997) 
  and Flather and Smith (1998) did not find any significant changes in extreme 
  events compared with the variability of the control climate (see also WASA Group, 
  1998). However, Langenberg et al. (1999) reported increases of 0.05 to 0.10 
  m in five-winter-mean high-water levels around all North Sea coasts, judged 
  to be significant compared with observed natural variability. Lowe et al. (2001) 
  undertook a similar study using multi-decadal integrations of the Hadley Centre 
  regional climate model for the present climate and the end of the 21st century 
  (<a href="430.htm#fig1114">Figure 11.14</a>), finding statistically significant 
  changes of up to 0.2 m in five-year extremes in the English Channel. Differences 
  between these various results relate to the length of model integration and 
  to systematic uncertainty in the modelling of both the atmospheric forcing and 
  the ocean response.</p>
<p>Changes in wind forcing could result in changes to wave heights, but with the 
  short integrations available, the WASA Group (Rider et al., 1996) were not able 
  to identify any significant changes for the North Atlantic and North Sea for 
  a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. G&uuml;nther et al. (1998) noted that changes 
  in future wave climate were similar to patterns of past variation.</p>
