<h4><a name="2254"></a>2.2.5.4 Mountain glaciers </h4>
<p>The recession of mountain glaciers was used in IPCC (1990) to provide qualitative 
  support to the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century. Work 
  on glacier recession has considerable potential to support or qualify the instrumental 
  record of temperature change and to cast further light on regional or worldwide 
  temperature changes before the instrumental era. Two types of data from glaciers 
  contain climatic information: (i) mass balance observations and (ii) data on 
  the geometry of glaciers, notably glacier length. More comprehensive information 
  is now becoming available and worldwide glacier inventories have been updated 
  (e.g., IAHS (ICSI)/UNEP/UNESCO, 1999). Note that changes in the Greenland and 
  Antarctic ice sheets are discussed in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<p>We first discuss mass balance observations. The specific mass balance is defined 
  as the net annual gain or loss of mass at the glacier surface, per unit area 
  of the surface. The mass balance averaged over an entire glacier is denoted 
  by B<sub>m</sub>. Systematic investigations of glacier mass balance started after 1945, 
  so these records are shorter than the instrumental climate records normally 
  available in the vicinity. In contrast to frequently made statements, B<sub>m</sub> is 
  not necessarily a more precise indicator of climate change than is glacier length. 
  Time-series of B<sub>m</sub> do contain year-to-year variability reflecting short-term 
  fluctuations in meteorological quantities but of concern on longer time-scales 
  is the effect of changing glacier geometry. A steadily retreating glacier will 
  get thinner and the mass balance will become more negative because of a slowly 
  increasing surface air temperature due to a lowering surface that is not reflected 
  in a large-scale temperature signal. Climatic interpretation of long-term trends 
  in of mass balance data requires the use of coupled mass balance-ice flow models 
  to separate the climatic and geometric parts of the signal. Such studies have 
  only just begun. However, mass balance observations are needed for estimating 
  the contribution of glacier melt to sea level rise, so are discussed further 
  in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<p>A wealth of information exists on the geometry of valley glaciers. Glacier 
  records are very useful for studies of Holocene climate variability (e.g., Haeberli 
  et al., 1998; and <a href="072.htm#24">Section 2.4</a>). Written documents going 
  back to the 16th century exist that describe catastrophic floods caused by the 
  bursting of glacier-dammed lakes or arable land and farms destroyed by advancing 
  glaciers, e.g., in 18th century Norway (&Oslash;strem et al., 1977). A large 
  amount of information is available from sketches, etchings, paintings and old 
  photographs of glaciers, though many show the same glaciers (Holzhauser and 
  Zumb&uuml;hl, 1996). About fifty glaciers have two or more useful pictures from 
  distinctly different times. In many cases geomorphologic evidence in the form 
  of terminal moraines and trimlines can be used as reliable complementary information 
  to construct the history of a glacier over the last few centuries. Systematic 
  mapping of glaciers started only 100 years ago and has been limited to a few 
  glaciers. The most comprehensive data are of length variations. Glacier length 
  records complement the instrumental meteorological record because (i) some extend 
  further back in time; (ii) some records are from remote regions where few meteorological 
  observations exist; (iii) on average, glaciers exist at a significantly higher 
  altitude than meteorological stations.</p>

<p>The last point is of particular interest in the light of the discrepancy between 
  recent tropical glacier length reduction and lack of warming in the lower troposphere 
  since 1979 indicated by satellites and radiosondes in the tropics (<a href="059.htm#223">Section 
  2.2.3</a>). Long-term monitoring of glacier extent provides abundant evidence 
  that tropical glaciers are receding at an increasing rate in all tropical mountain 
  areas. This applies to the tropical Andes (Brecher and Thompson, 1993; Hastenrath 
  and Ames, 1995; Ames, 1998), Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro (Hastenrath and Kruss, 
  1992; Hastenrath and Greischar, 1997) and to the glaciers in Irian Jaya (Peterson 
  and Peterson, 1994).</p>
<p>Relating mass balance fluctuations to meteorological conditions is more complicated 
  for tropical glaciers than for mid- and high latitude glaciers, and it has not 
  been demonstrated that temperature is the most important factor. Nevertheless, 
  the fast glacier recession in the tropics seems at first sight to be consistent 
  with an increase in tropical freezing heights of 100 m over the period 1970 
  to 1986 as reported by Diaz and Graham (1996), corresponding to an increase 
  of 0.5&deg;C at tropical high mountain levels, which they also link to increases 
  in tropical SST since the mid-1970s (<a href="057.htm#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>). 
  However, although Gaffen et al. (2000) found a similar increase over 1960 to 
  1997, they found a lowering of freezing level over 1979 to 1997 which, at least 
  superficially, is not consistent with glacier recession.</p>
<p><a href="#fig218">Figure 2.18</a> shows a representative selection of 
  glacier length records from different parts of the world and updates the diagram 
  in IPCC (1990). It is clear from <a href="#fig218">Figure 2.18</a> that 
  glacier retreat on the century time-scale is worldwide. The available data suggest 
  that this retreat generally started later at high latitudes but in low and mid-latitudes 
  the retreat generally started in the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>On the global scale, air temperature is considered by most glaciologists to 
  be the most important factor reflecting glacier retreat. This is based on calculations 
  with mass balance models (Greuell and Oerlemans, 1987; Oerlemans, 1992; Fleming 
  et al., 1997; J&oacute;hannesson, 1997). For a typical mid-latitude glacier, 
  a 30% decrease in cloudiness or a 25% decrease in precipitation would have the 
  same effect as a 1&deg;C temperature rise. Such changes in cloudiness or precipitation 
  can occur locally or even regionally on a decadal time-scale associated with 
  changes in circulation, but global trends of this size on a century time-scale 
  are very unlikely. As mentioned in the SAR, Oerlemans (1994) concluded that 
  a warming rate of 0.66 &plusmn; 0.20&deg;C per century at the mean glacier altitude 
  could explain the linear part of the observed retreat of 48 widely distributed 
  glaciers.</p>
<p>Glaciers are generally not in equilibrium with the prevailing climatic conditions 
  and a more refined analysis should deal with the different response times of 
  glaciers which involves modelling (Oerlemans et al., 1998). It will take some 
  time before a large number of glaciers are modelled. Nevertheless, work done 
  so far indicates that the response times of glacier lengths shown in <a href="#fig218">Figure 
  2.18</a> are in the 10 to 70 year range. Therefore the timing of the onset of 
  glacier retreat implies that a significant global warming is likely to have 
  started not later than the mid-19th century. This conflicts with the Jones et 
  al. (2001) global land instrumental temperature data (<a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 
  2.1</a>), and the combined hemispheric and global land and marine data (<a href="056.htm#fig27">Figure 
  2.7</a>), where clear warming is not seen until the beginning of the 20th century. 
  This conclusion also conflicts with some (but not all) of the palaeo-temperature 
  reconstructions in <a href="069.htm#fig221">Figure 2.21</a>, <a href="067.htm#23">Section 
  2.3</a> , where clear warming, e.g., in the Mann et al. (1999) Northern Hemisphere 
  series, starts at about the same time as in the Jones et al. (2001) data. These 
  discrepancies are currently unexplained. </p>
  For the last two to three decades, far more records have been available than 
  are shown in <a href="#fig218">Figure 2.18</a>. Many are documented at 
  the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland (e.g., IAHS 
  (ICSI)/UNEP/UNESCO, 1998) The general picture is one of widespread retreat, 
  notably in Alaska, Franz-Josef Land, Asia, the Alps, Indonesia and Africa, and 
  tropical and sub-tropical regions of South America. In a few regions a considerable 
  number of glaciers are currently advancing (e.g., Western Norway, New Zealand). 
  In Norway this is very likely to be due to increases in precipitation owing 
  to the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (<a href="083.htm#26">Section 
  2.6</a>), and in the Southern Alps of New Zealandand due to wetter conditions 
  with little warming since about 1980. Finally, indications in the European Alps 
  that current glacier recession is reaching levels not seen for perhaps a few 
  thousand years comes from the exposure of radiocarbon-dated ancient remains 
  in high glacial saddles. Here there is no significant ice flow and melting is 
  assumed to have taken place in situ for the first time in millennia (e.g., the 
  finding of the 5,000-year-old Oetzal "ice man").<br>
