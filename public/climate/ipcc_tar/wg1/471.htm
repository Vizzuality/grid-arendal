<h2>Appendix 12.4: Dimension Reduction </h2>
<p>Estimation of the signal amplitudes, as well as the detection and attribution 
  consistency tests on the amplitudes, requires an estimate of the covariance 
  matrix <b>C<sub>uu</sub></b> of the residual noise field. However, as <b>y</b> 
  typically represents climate variation on time-scales similar to the length 
  of the observed instrumental record, it is difficult to estimate the covariance 
  matrix reliably. Thus the covariance matrix is often estimated from a long control 
  simulation. Even so, the number of independent realisations of <b>u</b> that 
  are available from a typical 1,000 to 2,000-year control simulation is substantially 
  smaller than the dimension of the field, and thus it is not possible to estimate 
  the full covariance matrix. The solution is to replace the full fields <b>y</b>, 
  <b>g<sub><i>1</i></sub>,...,g<i><sub>m</sub></i></b> and <b>u</b> with vectors 
  of dimension <i>k</i>, where <i>m&lt;k&lt;&lt;n</i>, containing indices of their 
  projections onto the dominant patterns of variability <b>f<sub><i>1</i></sub>,...,f<sub><i>k</i></sub></b> 
  of <b>u</b>. These patterns are usually taken to be the <i>k</i> highest variance 
  EOFs of a control run (North and Stevens, 1998; Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et 
  al., 1999) or a forced simulation (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997; Schnur, 2001). 
  Stott and Tett (1998) showed with a "perfect model" study that climate change 
  in surface air temperature can only be detected at very large spatial scales. 
  Thus Tett et al. (1999) reduce the spatial resolution to a few spherical harmonics 
  prior to EOF truncation. Kim et al. (1996) and Zwiers and Shen (1997) examine 
  the sampling properties of spherical harmonic coefficients when they are estimated 
  from sparse observing networks.</p>
<p>An important decision, therefore, is the choice of <i>k</i>. A key consideration 
  in the choice is that the variability of the residuals should be consistent 
  with the variability of the control simulation in the dimensions that are retained. 
  Allen and Tett (1999) describe a simple test on the residuals that makes this 
  consistency check. Rejection implies that the model-simulated variability is 
  significantly different from that of the residuals. This may happen when the 
  number of retained dimensions, <i>k</i>, is too large because higher order EOFs 
  may contain unrealistically low variance due to sampling deficiencies or scales 
  that are not well represented. In this situation, the use of a smaller value 
  of <i>k </i>can still provide consistent results: there is no need to require 
  that model-simulated variability is perfect on all spatio-temporal scales for 
  it to be adequate on the very large scales used for detection and attribution 
  studies. However, failing the residual check of Allen and Tett (1999) could 
  also indicate that the model does not have the correct timing or pattern of 
  response (in which case the residuals will contain forced variability that is 
  not present in the control regardless of the choice of <i>k</i>) or that the 
  model does not simulate the correct amount of internal variability, even at 
  the largest scales represented by the low order EOFs. In this case, there is 
  no satisfactory choice of <i>k</i>. Previous authors (e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996, 
  1997; Stevens and North, 1996; North and Stevens, 1998) have made this choice 
  subjectively. Nonetheless, experience in recent studies (Tett et al. 1999; Hegerl 
  et al. 2000, 2001; Stott et al., 2001) indicates that their choices were appropriate.</p>
