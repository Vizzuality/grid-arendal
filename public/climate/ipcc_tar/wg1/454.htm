<h2>12.3 Qualitative Comparison of Observed and Modelled Climate Change </h2>
<h3><a name="1231"></a>12.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This section presents a qualitative assessment of consistencies and inconsistencies 
  between the observed climate changes identified in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> and model projections of anthropogenic climate change described in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>. </p>
<p>Most formal detection and attribution studies concentrate on variables with 
  high climate change signal-to-noise ratios, good observational data coverage, 
  and consistent signals from different model simulations, mainly using mean surface 
  air temperatures or zonal mean upper-air temperatures. To enhance the signal-to-noise 
  ratio, they generally consider variations on large spatial scales and time-scales 
  of several decades or longer.</p>
<p>There are many studies that have identified areas of qualitative consistency 
  and inconsistency between observed and modelled climate change. While the evidence 
  for an anthropogenic influence on climate from such studies is less compelling 
  than from formal attribution studies, a broad range of evidence of qualitative 
  consistency between observed and modelled climate change is also required. In 
  addition, areas of qualitative consistency may suggest the possibility for further 
  formal detection and attribution study. </p>
<h3><a name="1232"></a>12.3.2 Thermal Indicators</h3>
<p><i>Surface temperature</i><br>
  Global mean surface air temperature has been used in many climate change detection 
  studies. The warming shown in the instrumental observations over the last 140 
  years is larger than that over a comparable period in any of the multi-century 
  control simulations carried out to date (e.g., <a href="445.htm#fig121">Figure 
  12.1</a>; Stouffer et al., 2000). If the real world internal variability on 
  this time-scale is no greater than that of the models, then the temperature 
  change over the last 140 years has been unusual and therefore likely to be externally 
  forced. This is supported by palaeo-reconstructions of the last six centuries 
  (Mann et al., 1998) and the last 1,000 years (Briffa et al., 1998; 2000; Jones 
  et al., 1998; Crowley, 2000; Crowley and Lowery, 2000; Mann et al., 2000), which 
  show that the 20th century warming is highly unusual. Three of the five years 
  (1995, 1996 and 1998) added to the instrumental record since the SAR are the 
  warmest globally in the instrumental record, consistent with the expectation 
  that increases in greenhouse gases will lead to sustained long-term warming.</p>
<p>When anthropogenic factors are included, models provide a plausible explanation 
  of the changes in global mean temperature over the last hundred years (<a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 
  12.7</a>). It is conceivable that this agreement between models and observations 
  is spurious. For example, if a model's response to greenhouse gas increases 
  is too large (small) and the sulphate aerosol forcing too large (small), these 
  errors could compensate. Differences in the spatio-temporal patterns of response 
  to greenhouse gases and sulphate forcing nevertheless allow some discrimination 
  between them, so this compensation is not complete. On the other hand, when 
  forced with known natural forcings, models produce a cooling over the second 
  half of the 20th century (see <a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 12.7</a>) rather 
  than the warming trend shown in the observed record. The discrepancy is too 
  large to be explained through model estimates of internal variability and unlikely 
  to be explained through uncertainty in forcing history (Tett et al., 2000). 
  Schneider and Held (2001) applied a technique to isolate those spatial patterns 
  of decadal climate change in observed surface temperature data over the 20th 
  century which are most distinct from interannual variability. They find a spatial 
  pattern which is similar to model-simulated greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol 
  fingerprints in both July and December. The time evolution of this pattern shows 
  a strong trend with little influence of interannual variability. (Note that 
  this technique is related to optimal fingerprinting, but does not use prior 
  information on the pattern of expected climate change.)</p>
<p><i>Other thermal indicators</i><br>
  While most attention in formal detection and attribution studies has been paid 
  to mean surface air temperatures, a number of other thermal indicators of climate 
  variations are also discussed in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Many of these, 
  including warming in sub-surface land temperatures measured in bore holes, warming 
  indicators in ice cores and corresponding bore holes, warming in sub-surface 
  ocean temperatures, retreat of glaciers, and reductions in Arctic sea-ice extent 
  and in snow cover, are consistent with the recent observed warming in surface 
  air temperatures and with model projections of the response to increasing greenhouse 
  gases. Other observed changes in thermal indicators include a reduction in the 
  mean annual cycle (winters warming faster than summers) and in the mean diurnal 
  temperature range (nights warming faster than days) over land (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). While the changes in annual cycle are consistent with most model projections, 
  the observed changes in diurnal temperature range are larger than simulated 
  in most models for forcings due to increasing greenhouse gases and sulphate 
  aerosols this century (see <a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="308.htm">8</a>). 
  However, the spatial and temporal coverage of data for changes in observed diurnal 
  temperature range is less than for changes in mean temperatures, leading to 
  greater uncertainty in the observed global changes (Karoly and Braganza, 2001; 
  Schnur, 2001). Also, the observed reductions in diurnal temperature range are 
  associated with increases in cloudiness (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>), 
  which are not simulated well by models. Few models include the indirect effects 
  of sulphate aerosols on clouds. </p>
<p>Changes in sea-ice cover and snow cover in the transition seasons in the Northern 
  Hemisphere are consistent with the observed and simulated high latitude warming. 
  The observed trends in Northern Hemisphere sea-ice cover (Parkinson et al., 
  1999) are consistent with those found in climate model simulations of the last 
  century including anthropogenic forcing (Vinnikov et al., 1999). Sea-ice extent 
  in the Southern Hemisphere does not show any consistent trends.</p>
<p><i>Compatibility of surface and free atmosphere temperature trends</i><br>
  There is an overall consistency in the patterns of upper air temperature changes 
  with those expected from increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing stratospheric 
  ozone (tropo-spheric warming and stratospheric cooling). It is hard to explain 
  the observed changes in the vertical in terms of natural forcings alone, as 
  discussed in <a href="449.htm">Section 12.2.3.2</a> (see <a href="452.htm#fig128">Figure 
  12.8</a>). However, there are some inconsistencies between the observed and 
  modelled vertical patterns of temperature change. Observations indicate that, 
  over the last three to four decades, the tropical atmosphere has warmed in the 
  layer up to about 300 hPa and cooled above (Parker et al., 1997; Gaffen et al., 
  2000). Model simulations of the recent past produce a warming of the tropical 
  atmosphere to about 200 hPa, with a maximum at around 300 hPa not seen in the 
  observations. This discrepancy is less evident when co-located model and radiosonde 
  data are used (Santer et al., 2000), or if volcanic forcing is taken into account, 
  but does not go away entirely (Bengtsson et al., 1999; Brown et al., 2000b). 
  The MSU satellite temperature record is too short and too poorly resolved in 
  the vertical to be of use here.</p>
<p>Comparison of upper air and surface temperature data in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> shows that the lower to mid-troposphere has warmed less than the surface 
  since 1979. The satellite-measured temperature over a broad layer in the lower 
  troposphere around 750 hPa since 1979 shows no significant trend, in contrast 
  to the warming trend measured over the same time period at the surface. This 
  disparity has been assessed recently by a panel of experts (National Academy 
  of Sciences, 2000). They concluded that "the troposphere actually may have 
  warmed much less rapidly than the surface from 1979 to the late 1990s, due both 
  to natural causes (e.g., the sequence of volcanic eruptions that occurred within 
  this particular 20-year period) and human activities (e.g., the cooling in the 
  upper troposphere resulting from ozone depletion in the stratosphere)" 
  (see also Santer et al., 2000). They also concluded that "it is not currently 
  possible to determine whether or not there exists a fundamental discrepancy 
  between modelled and observed atmospheric temperature changes since the advent 
  of satellite data in 1979". Over the last 40 years, observed warming trends 
  in the lower troposphere and at the surface are similar, indicating that the 
  lower troposphere warmed faster than the surface for about two decades prior 
  to 1979 (Brown et al., 2000a; Gaffen et al., 2000). However, in the extra-tropical 
  Eurasian winter some additional warming of the surface relative to the lower 
  or mid-troposphere might be expected since 1979. This is due to an overall trend 
  towards an enhanced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson et al., 
  2000) which has this signature.</p>
<p>Model simulations of large-scale changes in tropospheric and surface temperatures 
  are generally statistically consistent with the observed changes (see <a href="456.htm">Section 
  12.4</a>). However, models generally predict an enhanced rate of warming in 
  the mid- to upper troposphere over that at the surface (i.e., a negative lapse-rate 
  feedback on the surface temperature change) whereas observations show mid-tropospheric 
  temperatures warming no faster than surface temperatures. It is not clear whether 
  this discrepancy arises because the lapse-rate feedback is consistently over-represented 
  in climate models or because of other factors such as observational error or 
  neglected forcings (Santer et al., 2000). Note that if models do simulate too 
  large a negative lapse-rate feedback, they will tend to underestimate the sensitivity 
  of climate to a global radiative forcing perturbation. </p>
<p><i>Stratospheric trends</i><br>
  A recent assessment of temperature trends in the stratosphere (Chanin and Ramaswamy, 
  1999) discussed the cooling trends in the lower stratosphere described in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>. It also identified large cooling trends in the middle and upper stratosphere, 
  which are consistent with anthropogenic forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion 
  and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. An increase in water vapour, possibly 
  due to increasing methane oxidation, is another plausible explanation for the 
  lower strato-spheric cooling (Forster and Shine, 1999) but global stratospheric 
  water vapour trends are poorly understood.</p>
