<h4>13.4.1.1 Regional modelling</h4>
<p>The basic strategy in regional modelling is to rely on the GCM to reproduce 
  the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and for the regional model to 
  simulate sub-GCM scale regional distributions or patterns of climate, such as 
  precipitation, temperature, and winds, over the region of interest (Giorgi and 
  Mearns, 1991; McGregor, 1997; Giorgi and Mearns, 1999). The GCM provides the 
  initial and lateral boundary conditions for driving the regional climate model 
  (RCM). In general, the spatial resolution of the regional model is on the order 
  of tens of kiilometres, whereas the GCM scale is an order of magnitude coarser. 
  Further details on the techniques of regional climate modelling are covered 
  in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>, <a href="389.htm">Section 10.5</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="13412"></a>13.4.1.2 Statistical downscaling</h4>
<p>In statistical downscaling, a cross-scale statistical relationship is developed 
  between large-scale variables of observed climate such as spatially averaged 
  500 hPa heights, or measure of vorticity, and local variables such as site-specific 
  temperature and precipitation (von Storch, 1995; Wilby and Wigley, 1997; Murphy, 
  1999). These relationships are assumed to remain constant in the climate change 
  context. Also, it is assumed that the predictors selected (i.e., the large-scale 
  variables) adequately represent the climate change signal for the predictand 
  (e.g., local-scale precipitation). The statistical relationship is used in conjunction 
  with the change in the large-scale variables to determine the future local climate. 
  Further details of these techniques are provided in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>, <a href="395.htm">Section 10.6</a>. </p>
<h4><a name="13413"></a>13.4.1.3 Applications of the methods to impacts</h4>
<p>While the two major techniques described above have been available for about 
  ten years, and proponents claim use in impact assessments as one of their important 
  applications, it is only quite recently that scenarios developed using these 
  techniques have actually been applied in a variety of impact assessments, such 
  as temperature extremes (Hennessy et al., 1998; Mearns, 1999); water resources 
  (Hassall and Associates, 1998; Hay et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1999; Wilby et 
  al., 1999; Stone et al., 2001); agriculture (Mearns et al., 1998, 1999, 2000a, 
  2001; Brown et al., 2000) and forest fires (Wotton et al., 1998). Prior to the 
  past couple of years, these techniques were mainly used in pilot studies focused 
  on increasing the temporal (and spatial) scale of scenarios (e.g., Mearns et 
  al., 1997; Semenov and Barrow, 1997).</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this work is determining whether the high 
  resolution scenario actually leads to significantly different calculations of 
  impacts compared to that of the coarser resolution GCM from which the high resolution 
  scenario was partially derived. This aspect is related to the issue of uncertainty 
  in climate scenarios (see <a href="491.htm">Section 13.5</a>). We provide examples 
  of such studies below. </p>
<p>Application of high resolution scenarios produced from a regional model (Giorgi 
  et al., 1998) over the Central Plains of the USA produced changes in simulated 
  crop yields that were significantly different from those changes calculated 
  from a coarser resolution GCM scenario (Mearns et al., 1998; 1999, 2001). For 
  simulated corn in Iowa, for example, the large-scale (GCM) scenario resulted 
  in a statistically significant decrease in yield, but the high resolution scenario 
  produced an insignificant increase (<a href="491.htm">Figure 13.5</a>). Substantial 
  differences in regional economic impacts based on GCM and RCM scenarios were 
  also found in a recent integrated assessment of agriculture in the south-eastern 
  USA (Mearns et al., 2000a,b). Hay et al. (1999), using a regression-based statistical 
  downscaling technique, developed downscaled scenarios based on the Hadley Centre 
  Coupled AOGCM (HadCM2) transient runs and applied them to a hydrologic model 
  in three river basins in the USA. They found that the standard scenario from 
  the GCM produced changes in surface runoff that were quite different from those 
  produced from the downscaled scenario (<a href="498.htm">Figure 13.6</a>).</p>
