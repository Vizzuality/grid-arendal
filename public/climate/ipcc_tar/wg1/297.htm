<p><a name="fig77"></a>Ice stream instability, ice shelf break-up and switches 
  in routing and discharge of glacial melt water present themselves as mechanisms 
  for altering the surface salinity of oceans and inducing changes in the pattern 
  and strength of the THC. There are positive and negative feedbacks associated 
  with changing land ice masses (<a href="#fig77">Figure 7.7</a>). In coupled 
  climate models, all these cryospheric processes are represented simply as surface 
  fresh water inputs to the ocean (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="322.htm#8542">Section 
  8.5.4.2</a>).</p>
<p> Ice sheets are continental scale masses of fresh water ice formed by the burial 
  and densification of snow. They can be divided into areas that are grounded 
  on the land surface, either below or above sea level, and areas that are afloat. 
  Grounded parts of ice sheets exhibit slow and fast modes of flow. The slow sheet-flowing 
  component is the more prevalent but the fast stream-flowing component can account 
  for most of the ice discharge. Switching between slow and fast modes of flow 
  may occur thermally, mechanically or hydrologically and is suggestive of "surging", 
  a known cyclic instability of certain glaciers (Kamb et al., 1985; Bindschadler, 
  1997). The slow-flow process for ice sheets is internal creep and the fast-flow 
  processes relevant to ice streams are bottom sliding, enhanced creep and sub-glacial 
  sediment deformation (Alley, 1989; Iken et al., 1993; Engelhardt and Kamb, 1998). 
  The factors controlling onset, discharge and width of ice streams are subject 
  to poorly understood geological, topographic, thermal and hydrological controls 
  (Clarke and Echelmeyer, 1996; Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997; Bindschadler, 
  1997; Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1998; Jacobson and Raymond, 
  1998).</p>
<p> Although in GCMs the albedo of land ice is typically fixed, satellite observations 
  could be used to remove this limitation; the melt area, as identified from satellite 
  passive microwave observations (Mote et al., 1993; Abdalati and Steffen, 1995), 
  and AVHRR-derived albedo estimates can now be mapped (Stroeve et al., 1997). 
  Land ice dynamics and thermodynamics, ignored in current coupled GCMs, respond 
  to changes in the temperature and balance of accumulation and melt at upper 
  and lower surfaces. These boundary conditions involve couplings to the atmosphere, 
  ocean and lithosphere. Ice sheet models typically represent atmospheric boundary 
  conditions using simple elevation-based parametrizations. However, results obtained 
  for Antarctica using this approach (Huybrechts and Oerlemans, 1990; Fastook 
  and Prentice, 1994) compare favourably with those using more comprehensive AGCM-derived 
  boundary conditions (Thompson and Pollard, 1997). Predictive models of future 
  evolution must incorporate past ice-mass variations because ice sheets continue 
  to respond to climate change for several thousand years. Time-scales complicate 
  the inclusion of land ice in existing coupled climate models, and it is usual 
  in these models to regard land ice as passive, providing only a static boundary 
  for the atmosphere. Models of ocean circulation seldom incorporate explicit 
  treatments of melt water inputs from land ice.</p>
<p> Models simulate the coupled evolution of ice sheet flow, form and temperature. 
  The flow law in Glen (1955) is commonly adopted but such models must employ 
  a poorly justified flow enhancement factor to correctly capture the height-to-width 
  ratios of ice sheets. In general, these models perform well in inter-comparison 
  exercises (Huybrechts et al., 1996; Payne et al., 2000), but there is uncertainty 
  in the predicted thermal structure and bottom melting conditions. This constitutes 
  a potentially serious shortcoming because several models of ice sheet instability 
  invoke thermal trigger mechanisms (MacAyeal, 1992). Ice stream flow models are 
  limited by the current knowledge of the controlling physical processes. Outstanding 
  issues involve the relative importance of bottom drag and lateral drag (Whillans 
  and van der Veen, 1993; MacAyeal et al., 1995) and the representation of fast-flow 
  and water-transport processes (Fowler and Schiavi, 1998; Hindmarsh, 1998; Tulaczyk 
  et al., 1998). Recently, coupled models of the evolution of ice streams within 
  ice sheets have been developed (Marshall and Clarke, 1997) which incorporate 
  the crucial processes of ice stream onset (Bell et al., 1998) and margin migration 
  (van der Veen and Whillans, 1996).</p>
<p> Floating margins of ice sheets are called ice shelves, the largest of which 
  are found in West Antarctica and mediate the transfer of ice between fast-flowing 
  ice streams and the Southern Ocean. Break-up of one or both of the large West 
  Antarctic ice shelves, either associated with ice stream instability or independent 
  of it, cannot be discounted and would be considerably more probable than complete 
  disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet (Bentley, 1998; see also <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>, <a href="427.htm">Section 11.3.3</a>). Such an event would be accompanied 
  by a large increase in iceberg flux to the Southern Ocean and uncertain effects 
  on the production of AABW and ocean circulation. Different ice shelf models 
  compare well (MacAyeal et al., 1996); however, the stability of grounding lines 
  remains an issue and could significantly influence the behaviour of numerical 
  models (Hindmarsh, 1993). The suggestion that the grounding line is inherently 
  unstable (Thomas and Bentley, 1978) is not supported by more recent modelling 
  studies (Muszynski and Birchfield, 1987; Huybrechts and Oerlemans, 1990; Hindmarsh, 
  1993). However, this issue has yet to be resolved.</p>
<p> Megafloods of water stored beneath ice sheets have been postulated (Shaw et 
  al., 1996) but the subject is controversial. The estimated total volume of lake 
  water beneath Antarctica is equivalent to 10 to 35 mm of sea level rise (Dowdeswell 
  and Siegert, 1999) but the simultaneous release of all this stored water is 
  unlikely. The timing would be unpredictable and climate impacts, if any, would 
  be associated with the effect of the fresh water pulse on AABW formation. Modelling 
  such phenomena is beyond the scope of existing ice dynamics models. Although 
  progress has been made in the understanding of ice stream processes, there are 
  still many unanswered questions and representation of ice stream and grounding 
  line physics in land-ice dynamics models remains rudimentary.</p>
