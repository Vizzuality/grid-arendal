<p> In the direct method the product of ocean velocity and temperature measured 
  over the boundaries is integrated to determine the ocean heat transport divergence 
  for the volume. While it deals with ocean circulation and the mechanisms of 
  ocean heat transport, estimates could only be made at a few locations where 
  high quality observations were available and assumptions, such as geostrophic 
  velocity estimates, are reasonable. Most of the recent estimates are for the 
  Atlantic Ocean (see <a href="298.htm#tab71">Table 7.1</a>), for which there 
  is general agreement that there is northward ocean heat transport at all latitudes. 
  It is generally understood that this northward heat transport is associated 
  with the THC in which NADW is formed in the polar and sub-polar North Atlantic 
  and subsequently flows southward as a deep western boundary current into the 
  Southern Ocean. In the North Pacific Ocean at 10&deg;N (Wijffels et al., 1996), 
  the northward heat flux of 0.7 &plusmn; 0.5 PW (1 PetaWatt = 1 PW = 10<sup>15</sup> 
  W) is due primarily to a shallow Ekman upper thermocline cell. It is estimated 
  that a 6 Sv change in Ekman transport, which is comparable to the differences 
  among existing climatologies, would cause a 0.4 PW change in meridional heat 
  transport. For the South Pacific (Koshlyakov and Sazhina, 1996; Tsimplis et 
  al., 1998) and Indian oceans (Robbins and Toole, 1997) the determination of 
  ocean heat transport is hampered by uncertainties in the size of the Indonesian 
  Throughflow and in the Agulhas Current transports (Beal and Bryden, 1997), and 
  the estimates of northward heat transport across 30&deg;S in the Indian Ocean 
  range from -0.4 to -1.3 PW (Robbins and Toole, 1997; Macdonald, 1998). 
  Macdonald (1998) and Macdonald and Wunsch (1996) have made a global inverse 
  analysis of selected high quality hydrographic sections covering all ocean basins 
  taken prior to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) observational period 
  to produce meridional heat transports (<a href="298.htm#tab71">Table 7.1</a>). 
  For the heat fluxes, results from the methods are beginning to converge. While 
  some new direct ocean fresh water transport measurements (Saunders and King, 
  1995) indicate that the South Atlantic receives adequate excess precipitation 
  to supply the cross equatorial flux of fresh water for North Atlantic excess 
  evaporation, this runs contrary to previous estimates (Wijffels et al., 1992) 
  and the recent atmospheric moisture budget results (Trenberth and Guillemot, 
  1998). </p>
<p> The latest results of the zonal mean ocean heat transports computed from (i) 
  observational data as residuals, (ii) models run without flux adjustments and 
  (iii) direct measurements agree within error estimates (<a href="298.htm#tab71">Table 
  7.1</a>). This suggests that the models are now converging on the correct values 
  for the zonally averaged heat fluxes. However, significant regional biases and 
  compensating errors in the radiative and turbulent fluxes still exist (Doney 
  et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2000). The coupled model fresh water flux estimates 
  are more problematic. For example, the inter-tropical convergence zone may become 
  skewed and spuriously migrate from one hemisphere to the other, seriously distorting 
  the precipitation fields (e.g., Boville and Gent, 1998).</p>
<p> The compatibility and improvements of the ocean and atmospheric heat transports 
  in models is evidently the primary reason why coupled runs can now be made without 
  flux adjustments (Gregory and Mitchell, 1997). This is due to a better representation 
  of key processes in both atmosphere and ocean components of climate models, 
  and improved spatial resolution. These key processes include, in the atmosphere, 
  convection, boundary-layer physics, clouds, and surface latent heat fluxes (Hack, 
  1998), and in the ocean, boundary layer and mesoscale eddy mixing processes 
  (Doney et al., 1998; Large and Gent, 1999). However, while simulated SSTs generally 
  agree well with observations (deviations of less than 2&deg;C), there are large 
  areas where consistent errors of SST occur in the models (e.g., too cold in 
  the North Pacific; too warm in coastal upwelling regions, see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="315.htm#fig81">Figure 8.1a</a>). These point to processes that 
  must be improved in future models. For instance, stratocumulus decks are not 
  well simulated in coupled models, resulting in significant deviations of SST 
  from the observed (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="315.htm#fig81">Figure 
  8.1a</a> and <a href="315.htm#842">Section 8.4.2</a> for a discussion).</p>
