<h4>7.2.2.5 Representation of cloud processes in models</h4>
<p>Over the last 10 years, the generalised availability of satellite retrievals 
  (OLR, water path, cloud cover, cloud top temperature) has strongly increased 
  the possibility of assessing clouds simulated by climate models, in spite of 
  remaining uncertainties concerning the vertical structure of the cloud systems, 
  of large importance for all feedback effects. Yet this remains a very difficult 
  task, which may be illustrated by a few figures. Recent simulations of equilibrium 
  climate with a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> indicate that the induced variation 
  of net cloud radiative forcing short-wave or long-wave, ranges within &plusmn;3 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is a small fraction of the cloud mean long-wave warming 
  (30 to 35 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) or cloud mean short-wave cooling (45 to 50 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  (Le Treut and McAvaney, 2000; <a href="#fig72">Figure 7.2</a>). Although most 
  models simulate CRF values within the uncertainty range of the observed values, 
  the discrepancy in terms of response to CO<sub>2</sub> increase is large, both 
  in sign, amplitude, and share between long-wave and short-wave. This disagreement 
  (amplified by the water vapour feedback) reflects the sensitivity of the simulated 
  feedbacks to model formulation (Watterson et al., 1999; Yao and Del Genio, 1999; 
  Meleshko et al., 2000) and is the cause of the large spread in model climate 
  sensitivity (see <a href="#fig73">Figure 7.3</a>; and <a href="308.htm">Chapters 
  8</a> and <a href="338.htm">9</a>). The correct simulation of the mean distribution 
  of cloud cover and radiative fluxes is therefore a necessary but by no means 
  sufficient test of a model's ability to handle realistically the cloud 
  feedback processes relevant for climate change.</p>

            Radiative Forcing (CRF) associated with a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling 
            (from a review by Le Treut and McAvaney, 2000). The models are coupled 
            to a slab ocean mixed layer and are brought to equilibrium for present 
            climatic conditions and for a double CO<sub>2</sub> climate. The sign 
            is positive when an increase of the CRF (from present to double CO<sub>2</sub> 
            conditions) increases the warming, negative when it reduces it. The 
            contribution of the shortwave (SW, solar) and long-wave (LW, terrestrial) 
            components are first distinguished, and then added to provide a net 
            effect (black bars). Results presented in the diagram are bounded

<p>Satellite records provide some access to the study of natural climate fluctuations, 
  such as the seasonal or ENSO cycles, which can be used to test the ability of 
  the models to represent different feedbacks. At these time-scales, however, 
  cloud structures are characterised by large shifts in their latitudinal or longitudinal 
  position, as well as changes in their vertical distribution in response to SST 
  changes. Only those latter effects are really relevant to test climate models 
  in the context of climate change. Bony et al. (1997) have shown that in the 
  inter-tropical regions, it was possible to isolate them by looking at the dependence 
  of cloud properties on SST for specified dynamical regimes. These regressions 
  are remarkably consistent when carried out with different sets of independent 
  data (ISCCP, ERBE, TOVS, SSMI) and offer a constraining test for models. Similar 
  methodologies are being developed for the mid-latitudes (Tselioudis et al., 
  2000). It is encouraging, though, that CCM3 has demonstrated considerable accuracy 
  in the reproduction of regional all-sky long-wave and short-wave radiation budgets 
  (Kiehl et al., 1998).</p>
<p> Since the SAR, there has been progress in the qualitative understanding of 
  the complexity of cloud/climate relation. There is also an important and ongoing 
  evolution of the cloud parametrizations included into the models, which is characterised 
  by a greater physical consistency and a greatly enhanced physical content: in 
  particular many models now include a more comprehensive representation of sub-grid 
  scales, convective or turbulent, and explicit microphysics, liquid or ice. Simulation 
  of current climate with those advanced models demonstrate capability to reproduce 
  realistically many features of the cloud radiative forcing and its seasonal 
  variations, for both the solar and terrestrial components.</p>
<p> In spite of these improvements, there has been no apparent narrowing of the 
  uncertainty range associated with cloud feedbacks in current climate change 
  simulations. A straight-forward approach of model validation is not sufficient 
  to constrain the models efficiently and a more dedicated approach is needed. 
  This should be favoured by a greater availability of satellite measurements.</p>
