<h4>Anthropogenic aerosols are short-lived and mostly produce negative radiative 
  forcing.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The major sources of anthropogenic aerosols are fossil fuel and biomass 
    burning. These sources are also linked to degradation of air quality and acid 
    deposition.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Since the SAR, significant progress has been achieved in better characterising 
    the direct radiative roles of different types of aerosols. Direct radiative 
    forcing is estimated to be -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for sulphate, -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
    for biomass burning aerosols, -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel organic 
    carbon and <br>
    <br>
    +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. There is much 
    less confidence in the ability to quantify the total aerosol direct effect, 
    and its evolution over time, than that for the gases listed above. Aerosols 
    also vary considerably by region and respond quickly to changes in emissions.<br>
    <br>
  <li>In addition to their direct radiative forcing, aerosols have an indirect 
    radiative forcing through their effects on clouds. There is now more evidence 
    for this indirect effect, which is negative, although of very uncertain magnitude.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Natural factors have made small contributions to radiative forcing over the 
  past century.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The radiative forcing due to changes in solar irradiance for the period 
    since 1750 is estimated to be about +0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, most of which occurred 
    during the first half of the 20th century. Since the late 1970s, satellite 
    instruments have observed small oscillations due to the 11-year solar cycle. 
    Mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on climate have been proposed, 
    but currently lack a rigorous theoretical or observational basis.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions lead to negative 
    forcing, which lasts a few years. Several major eruptions occurred in the 
    periods 1880 to 1920 and 1960 to 1991.<br>
    <br>
  <li>The combined change in radiative forcing of the two major natural factors 
    (solar variation and volcanic aerosols) is estimated to be negative for the 
    past two, and possibly the past four, decades.<br>
</ul>
<h3>Confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased.</h3>

      <b>Figure 4: </b>Simulating the Earth's temperature variations, and 
      comparing the results to measured changes, can provide insight into the 
      underlying causes of the major changes. <br>
      <br>
      A climate model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur 
      both from natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations represented 
      by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation 
      and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with 
      anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulphate aerosols, 
      and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural and 
      anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can be seen that inclusion 
      of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation for a substantial 
      part of the observed temperature changes over the past century, but the 
      best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic 
      factors are included. These results show that the forcings included are 
      sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility 
      that other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results 
      presented here are for four runs from the same model. Similar results to 
      those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing.

<a name="figspm4"></a>Complex physically-based climate models are required to 
provide detailed estimates of feedbacks and of regional features. Such models 
cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully 
for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature difference since 
1979) and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their 
interaction with radiation and aerosols. Nevertheless, confidence in the ability 
of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due 
to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time-scales. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of climate processes and their incorporation in climate models 
    have improved, including water vapour, sea-ice dynamics, and ocean heat transport.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Some recent models produce satisfactory simulations of current climate without 
    the need for non-physical adjustments of heat and water fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere 
    interface used in earlier models.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Simulations that include estimates of natural and anthropogenic forcing 
    reproduce the observed large-scale changes in surface temperature over the 
    20th century (<a href="#figspm4">Figure 4</a>). However, contributions from 
    some additional processes and forcings may not have been included in the models. 
    Nevertheless, the large-scale consistency between models and observations 
    can be used to provide an independent check on projected warming rates over 
    the next few decades under a given emissions scenario.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Some aspects of model simulations of ENSO, monsoons and the North Atlantic 
    Oscillation, as well as selected periods of past climate, have improved.<br>
</ul>
<h3>There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over 
  the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.</h3>
The SAR concluded: "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human 
influence on global climate". That report also noted that the anthropogenic 
signal was still emerging from the background of natural climate variability. 
Since the SAR, progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly with 
respect to distinguishing and quantifying the magnitude of responses to different 
external influences. Although many of the sources of uncertainty identified in 
the SAR still remain to some degree, new evidence and improved understanding support 
an updated conclusion.<br>
<ul>
  <li>There is a longer and more closely scrutinised temperature record and new 
    model estimates of variability. The warming over the past 100 years is very 
    unlikely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to be due to internal variability alone, as estimated by current models. Reconstructions 
    of climate data for the past 1,000 years (<a href="005.htm#figspm1">Figure 
    1b</a>) also indicate that this warming was unusual and is unlikely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to be entirely natural in origin. <br>
    <br>
  <li>There are new estimates of the climate response to natural and anthropogenic 
    forcing, and new detection techniques have been applied. Detection and attribution 
    studies consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate 
    record of the last 35 to 50 years. <br>
  <li>Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e., the response 
    to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic eruptions) do not explain 
    the warming in the second half of the 20th century (see for example <a href="#figspm4">Figure 
    4a</a>). However, they indicate that natural forcings may have contributed 
    to the observed warming in the first half of the 20th century. <br>
    <br>
  <li>The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases 
    can be identified despite uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate 
    aerosol and natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic 
    sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this period and 
    therefore cannot explain the warming. Changes in natural forcing during most 
    of this period are also estimated to be negative and are unlikely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to explain the warming.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Detection and attribution studies comparing model simulated changes with 
    the observed record can now take into account uncertainty in the magnitude 
    of modelled response to external forcing, in particular that due to uncertainty 
    in climate sensitivity.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Most of these studies find that, over the last 50 years, the estimated rate 
    and magnitude of warming due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases 
    alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming. Furthermore, 
    most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse gases and sulphate 
    aerosols are consistent with observations over this period.<br>
    <br>
  <li>The best agreement between model simulations and observations over the last 
    140 years has been found when all the above anthropogenic and natural forcing 
    factors are combined, as shown in <a href="#figspm4">Figure 4c</a>). . These 
    results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed 
    changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other forcings may also have 
    contributed.<br>
</ul>
<p>In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, 
  most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  that the 20th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed 
  sea level rise, through thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of 
  land ice. Within present uncertainties, observations and models are both consistent 
  with a lack of significant acceleration of sea level rise during the 20th century.</p>
