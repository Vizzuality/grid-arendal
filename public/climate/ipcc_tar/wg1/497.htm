<h4>13.5.2.4 Annotation of climate scenarios</h4>
<p>Even if quantifiable uncertainties are represented, further uncertainties in 
  climate scenarios may still need to be documented or explicitly treated. These 
  include the possible impact on scenarios of errors in the unforced model simulation, 
  the possibility that current models cannot adequately simulate the enhanced 
  greenhouse response of a climatic feature of interest, or inconsistencies between 
  results of model simulations and emerging observed climatic trends. For these 
  reasons climate scenarios are often annotated with a list of caveats, along 
  with some assessment as to their importance for the scenario user. </p>
<p>When choosing which GCM(s) to use as the basis for climate scenario construction, 
  one of the criteria that has often been used is the ability of the GCM to simulate 
  present day climate. Many climate scenarios have used this criterion to assist 
  in their choice of GCM, arguing that GCMs that simulate present climate more 
  faithfully are likely to simulate more plausible future climates (e.g., Whetton 
  and Pittock, 1991; Robock et al., 1993; Risbey and Stone, 1996; Gyalistras et 
  al., 1997; Smith and Pitts, 1997; Smith and Hulme, 1998; Lal and Harasawa, 2000). 
  A good simulation of present day climate, however, is neither a necessary nor 
  a sufficient condition for accurate simulation of climate change (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>). It is possible, for example, that a model with a poor simulation of 
  present day climate could provide a more accurate simulation of climate change 
  than one which has a good simulation of present climate, if it contains a better 
  representation of the dominant feedback processes that will be initiated by 
  radiative forcing. While such uncertainties are difficult to test, useful insights 
  into the ability of models to simulate long-term climate change can also be 
  obtained by comparing model simulations of the climate response to past changes 
  in radiative forcing against reconstructed paleoclimates.</p>
<p>This approach to GCM selection, however, raises a number of questions. Over 
  which geographic domain should the GCM be evaluated - the global domain 
  or only over the region of study? Which climate variables should be evaluated upper air synoptic features that largely control the surface climate, 
  or only those climate variables, mostly surface, that are used in impact studies? 
  Recent AOGCMs simulate observed 1961 to 1990 mean climate more faithfully than 
  earlier GCMs (Kittel et al., 1998; see also <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), 
  but they still show large errors in simulating inter-annual climate variability 
  in some regions (Giorgi and Francisco, 2000; Lal et al., 2000) and in replicating 
  ENSO-like behaviour in the tropics (Knutson et al., 1997). These questions demonstrate 
  that there is no easy formula to apply when choosing GCMs for climate scenario 
  construction; there will always be a role for informed but, ultimately, individual 
  judgement. This judgement, however, should be made not just on empirical grounds 
  (for example, which model's present climate correlates best with observations) 
  but also on the basis of understanding the reasons for good or bad model performance, 
  particularly if those reasons are important for the particular scenario application.</p>
<p>Several examples of such annotations can be given. Lal and Giorgi (1997) suggested 
  that GCMs that cannot simulate the observed interannual variability of the Indian 
  monsoon correctly should not be used as the basis for climate scenarios. Giorgi 
  et al. (1998) commented that model-simulated spring temperatures over the USA 
  Central Plains were too cold in both the CSIRO GCM and in the CSIRO-driven RegCM2 
  control simulations and affected the credibility of the ensuing temperature 
  climate scenarios. Finally, scenarios prepared for the Australian region have 
  often been accompanied by the note that ENSO is an important component of Australian 
  climate that may change in the future, but that is not yet adequately simulated 
  in climate models (e.g., Hennessy et al., 1998). Expert judgment can also be 
  used to place confidence estimates on scenario ranges (Morgan and Keith, 1995). 
  For example, Jones et al. (2000) placed "high confidence" on the temperature 
  scenarios (incorporating quantifiable uncertainty) prepared for the South Pacific, 
  but only "moderate to low confidence" in the corresponding rainfall 
  scenarios. </p>
