<p><i>Are a significant fraction of ice nucleating aerosols anthropogenic?</i></p>
<p>For cirrus cloud formed by homogeneous nucleation on haze particles, there 
  are clearly solid grounds for asserting that there is a substantive anthropogenic 
  component to the associated IN. Most chemical transport models (e.g., Penner 
  et al., 1994b; Feichter et al., 1996; Graf et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1999; 
  Rasch et al., 2000a) as well as sulphur isotope studies (e.g., Norman et al., 
  1999) suggest that a substantial fraction of the upper-tropospheric sulphate 
  burden (and thus the sulphate haze droplets involved in homogeneous nucleation) 
  is anthropogenic although quantitative estimates vary from model to model. Furthermore, 
  for wintertime polar clouds, a special case of low-level cirrus, there are observations 
  and modelling results to indicate that, through suppression of the freezing 
  point, the acidic aerosols of Arctic haze favour the formation of large ice 
  crystals rather than the smaller particles in unpolluted ice fog during the 
  Arctic airmass cooling process. The larger particles increase the sedimentation 
  flux and deplete water vapor from the atmosphere, providing a negative forcing 
  (Blanchet and Girard, 1995). There are also grounds for asserting that changes 
  in the sulphate abundance will lead to increases in ice nucleation (cf., Jensen 
  and Toon, 1992, 1994; K&auml;rcher et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1998; Fahey et 
  al. 1999) so that a positive forcing is plausible. In any case, anthropogenic 
  modulation of ice particles should certainly be considered. </p>
<p> For cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere formed on insoluble, heterogeneous 
  IN, the situation is much less clear. Recent observations of heterogeneous IN 
  in both the upper and lower troposphere are suggestive of a large role for crustally 
  derived aerosols (e.g., Kumai, 1976; Hagen et al., 1995; Heintzenberg et al., 
  1996; Kriedenweis et al., 1998). On the other hand, there is some evidence of 
  a carbonaceous component as well (K&auml;rcher et al., 1996), quite likely coming 
  from aircraft exhaust (Jensen and Toon, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Strom and Ohlsson, 
  1998; Petzold et al., 1998). Hence, while the precise partitioning of heterogeneous 
  IN amount between anthropogenic and natural is not currently feasible, a significant 
  fraction might be anthropogenic.</p>
<p> For ice formation in other lower-tropospheric clouds, the situation is also 
  unclear. All of the IN must necessarily be heterogeneous nuclei, with all of 
  the ambiguities as to source that this implies. Natural ice nuclei are certainly 
  not lacking. In addition to the soil source alluded to above, biogenic IN have 
  been measured at significant levels, in both laboratory and field studies (cf., 
  Schnell and Vali, 1976; Levin and Yankofsky, 1983). Much of this work has been 
  recently reviewed in Szyrmer and Zawadzki (1997). </p>
<p> Numerous aerosol species of anthropogenic origin have been identified, both 
  in the laboratory and in the field, as effective ice initiators (e.g., Hogan, 
  1967; Langer et al., 1967; Van Valin et al., 1976). However, measurement of 
  enhanced IN concentrations from industrial sources has produced contradictory 
  results. In some cases (e.g., Hobbs and Locatelli, 1970; Al-Naime and Saunders, 
  1985), above background IN concentrations have been found in urban plumes while 
  in other instances below background levels have been found (e.g., Braham and 
  Spyers-Duran, 1974; Perez et al., 1985). Some of the discrepancies may be attributable 
  to differing measurement techniques (Szyrmer and Zawadzki, 1997). However, it 
  is possible that a good deal of it is due to differing degrees of deactivation 
  of IN by pollutants such as sulphate, which readily forms in the atmosphere 
  and can coat IN surfaces thereby deactivating them (particularly if the mechanism 
  for ice formation involves deposition from the gas phase). Indeed, Bigg (1990) 
  has presented evidence, albeit inconclusive, of a long-term decrease in IN associated 
  with increasing pollution, perhaps acting through such a mechanism. There is 
  also the possibility that secondary aerosol constituents such as aliphatic alcohols 
  or dicarboxylic acids could coat inactive particles and thus transform them 
  into efficient IN. If so, an incubation period after primary emission would 
  be necessary and measurements could differ depending on time from emission. 
  Although variability in natural heterogeneous IN sources may produce frequent 
  circumstances where natural IN sources exceed anthropogenic IN in importance, 
  it is difficult to see how the anthropogenic impact, both positive and negative, 
  can be neglected.<br>
</p>
<p><i>How might the anthropogenic IN component vary with time?</i><br>
</p>
<p>This is the least tractable question of all, with all of the uncertainties 
  in the answers to the previous questions propagating into any proposed answer. 
  For homogeneous nucleation in upper-level, cirriform clouds, an assertion that 
  the number of ice forming particles will be related to sulphur emissions is 
  at least tenable. However, for the lower troposphere, little can be said at 
  present. The impact of anthropogenic emissions could be negative, due to "poisoning" 
  of natural IN; positive, due perhaps, to increased organic and inorganic carbon 
  compared to inorganic non-carbon pollution emissions; or simply have little 
  impact due to a small net source strength compared to those of natural IN.</p>
