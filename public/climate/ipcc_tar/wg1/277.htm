<h3>7.2.4 Radiative Processes</h3>
<h4><a name="7241"></a>7.2.4.1 Radiative processes in the troposphere</h4>
<p>Radiative processes constitute the ultimate source and sink of energy in the 
  climate system. They are generally well known, and particularly the clear-sky 
  long-wave transfer, including the absorption properties of most greenhouse gases. 
  Their treatment in atmospheric general circulation models relies on several 
  approximations: the fluxes are computed as averaged quantities over a few spectral 
  intervals, the propagation is limited to the vertical upwelling or downwelling 
  directions, and the role of sub-grid scale features of the clouds or aerosols 
  is essentially neglected. Although this methodology is believed to have only 
  a marginal impact on the accuracy of computed long-wave fluxes, the analysis 
  of satellite, ground-based or aircraft measurements (Cess et al., 1995; Pilewskie 
  and Valero, 1995; Ramanathan et al., 1995) has generated a concern that the 
  radiative algorithms used in climate models could significantly underestimate 
  the atmospheric shortwave absorption. Similar results have been obtained as 
  part of the ARM/ARESE experiment (Valero et al., 1997; Zender et al., 1997). 
  The excess, or "anomalous" observed absorption may reach typical values 
  of about 30 to 40 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Its very existence, however, remains controversial and 
  is at odds with other investigations. Li et al. (1995) analysed large global 
  data sets from satellite (ERBE) and ground observations (GEBA). They did not 
  find the anomalous absorption except for a few tropical sites over a short period 
  of time. The exception appears to be induced by enhanced absorption due to biomass 
  burning aerosols (Li, 1998). Limited accuracy of the measurements (Imre et al., 
  1996) and the methodology of analysis (Arking et al., 1996; Stephens, 1996; 
  Barker and Li, 1997) have been raised as possible contributing factors to the 
  finding of the anomalous absorption. </p>
<p> A comparison of the ARM-ARESE measurements with a state of the art radiation 
  code, which uses measured atmospheric quantities as an input, and relies on 
  the same physical assumptions as used in climate models, indicated that the 
  anomalous absorption is larger for cloudy than for clear conditions, and also 
  tends to be larger for visible rather than for near-infrared fluxes (Zender 
  et al., 1997). These two characteristics are consistent with the results of 
  a comparison between the output of the CCM3 general circulation model and observations 
  from Nimbus 7 (Collins, 1998). However, Li et al. (1999) analysed all the data 
  sets collected during the ARM/ARESE experiment made by space-borne, air-borne 
  and ground-based instruments and did not find any significant absorption anomaly. 
  They traced the source of controversial findings to be associated with inconsistent 
  measurements made by some air-borne radiometers as used in the studies of Valero 
  et al. (1997) and Zender et al. (1997) with those from all other instruments. 
  However, other studies (Cess et al., 1999; Pope and Valero, 2000; Valero et 
  al., 2000), that do find a significant absorption anomaly, have further demonstrated 
  that the ARESE data do indeed satisfy a number of consistency tests as well 
  as being in agreement with measurements made by other instruments. Meanwhile, 
  evidence of enhanced cloud absorption has been found from measurements of the 
  MGO aircraft laboratory (Kondratyev et al., 1998). Inclusion of anomalous absorption 
  has been found to improve the representation of atmospheric tides (Braswell 
  and Lindzen, 1998). There finally exists evidence of an effect associated with 
  clear-sky conditions - in the presence of aerosols: models tend to overpredict 
  clear-sky diffusion to the surface (Kato et al., 1997).</p>
<p> The three dimensional nature of the solar radiation diffusion by cloud (Breon, 
  1992; Cahalan et al., 1994; Li and Moreau, 1996) is unaccounted for by present 
  climate models and may play some role in anomalous absorption. In a recent study 
  using a Monte-Carlo approach to simulate three-dimensional radiative transfer, 
  O'Hirok and Gautier (1998a; 1998b) show that cloud inhomogeneities can 
  increase both the near-infrared gaseous absorption and cloud droplet absorption 
  in morphologically complex cloud fields. The enhancement is caused when photons 
  diffused from cloud edges more easily reach water-rich low levels of the atmosphere 
  and when photons entering the sides of clouds become trapped within the cloud 
  cores. The amplitude of those effects remains limited to an average range of 
  6 to 15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, depending on the solar angle. The inhomogeneities significantly 
  affect the vertical distribution of the heating, though, with potential consequences 
  on cloud development. Incorporating the effect of cloud inhomogeneities in radiative 
  algorithms may become a necessity, and recent efforts have been made along that 
  path (Oreopoulos and Barker, 1999).</p>
<p> If anomalous absorption turns out to be real, it is an effect that will need 
  to be incorporated into radiation schemes. Evaluation of its importance is hampered 
  by lack of knowledge of a physical mechanism responsible for the absorption, 
  and hence lack of a physical basis for any parametrization. Modelling studies 
  by Kiehl et al. (1995) have demonstrated the sensitivity of the simulated climate 
  to changes in the atmospheric absorption. As a radiative forcing, anomalous 
  absorption is fundamentally different from water vapour or CO<sub>2</sub> in that it does 
  not significantly alter the Earth's net radiation budget. Instead, it shifts 
  some of the deposition of solar energy from the ground to the atmosphere (Li 
  et al., 1997), with implications for the hydrological cycle and vertical temperature 
  profile of the atmosphere. Anomalous absorption may not, however, appreciably 
  affect climate sensitivity (Cess et al., 1996).</p>
<p> Model validation is also affected. Many of the data which are used to tune 
  or validate model parametrizations, such as the Liquid Water Path (LWP) or the 
  droplet equivalent radius, are obtained from space measurements by the inversion 
  of radiative algorithms, which ignore cloud inhomogeneities and anomalous absorption. 
  This gives a strong importance to satellite instruments such as POLDER which 
  provide measurements of the same scene at a variety of viewing angles, and provides 
  a good test of the plane-parallel hypothesis in retrievals of cloud quantities.
