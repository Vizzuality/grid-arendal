<h2><a name="23"></a>2.3 Is the Recent Warming Unusual? </h2>
<h3><a name="231"></a>2.3.1 Background </h3>
<p>To determine whether 20th century warming is unusual, it is essential to place 
  it in the context of longer-term climate variability. Owing to the sparseness 
  of instrumental climate records prior to the 20th century (especially prior 
  to the mid-19th century), estimates of global climate variability during past 
  centuries must often rely upon indirect "proxy'' indicators - 
  natural or human documentary archives that record past climate variations, but 
  must be calibrated against instrumental data for a meaningful climate interpretation 
  (Bradley, 1999, gives a review). Coarsely resolved climate trends over several 
  centuries are evident in many regions e.g., from the recession of glaciers (Grove 
  and Switsur, 1994; and <a href="064.htm#2254">Section 2.2.5.4</a>) or the geothermal 
  information provided by borehole measurements (Pollack et al., 1998). Large-scale 
  estimates of decadal, annual or seasonal climate variations in past centuries, 
  however, must rely upon sources that resolve annual or seasonal climatic variations. 
  Such proxy information includes width and density measurements from tree rings 
  (e.g., Cook, 1995; see Fritts, 1991, for a review), layer thickness from laminated 
  sediment cores (e.g., Hughen et al., 1996; Lamoureux and Bradley, 1996), isotopes, 
  chemistry, and accumulation from annually resolved ice cores (e.g., Claussen 
  et al., 1995; Fisher et al., 1998), isotopes from corals (e.g., Tudhope et al., 
  1995; Dunbar and Cole, 1999), and the sparse historical documentary evidence 
  available over the globe during the past few centuries (see e.g., Bradley and 
  Jones, 1995; Pfister et al., 1998). Taken as a whole, such proxy climate data 
  can provide global scale sampling of climate variations several centuries into 
  the past, with the potential to resolve large-scale patterns of climate change 
  prior to the instrumental period, albeit with important limitations and uncertainties.</p>
<p>The SAR examined evidence for climate change in the past, on time-scales of 
  centuries to millennia. Based on information from a variety of proxy climate 
  indicators, reconstructions of mountain glacier mass and extent, and geothermal 
  sub-surface information from boreholes, it was concluded that summer temperatures 
  in the Northern Hemisphere during recent decades are the warmest in at least 
  six centuries. While data prior to AD 1400 were considered too sparse for reliable 
  inferences regarding hemispheric or global mean temperatures, regional inferences 
  were nonetheless made about climate changes further back in time. </p>
<p>Since the SAR, a number of studies based on considerably expanded databases 
  of palaeoclimate information have allowed more decisive conclusions about the 
  spatial and temporal patterns of climate change in past centuries. A number 
  of important advances have been in key areas such as ice core palaeoclimatology 
  (e.g., White et al., 1998a), dendroclimatology (e.g., Cook, 1995; Briffa et 
  al., 1998b), and geothermal palaeo-temperature estimation (e.g., Pollack et 
  al., 1998). Moreover, the latest studies based on global networks of "multi-proxy" 
  data have proved particularly useful for describing global or hemispheric patterns 
  of climate variability in past centuries (e.g., Bradley and Jones, 1993; Hughes 
  and Diaz, 1994; Mann et al., 1995; Fisher, 1997; Overpeck et al., 1997; Mann 
  et al., 1998, 1999). Such estimates allow the observed trends of the 20th century 
  to be put in a longer-term perspective. These have also allowed better comparisons 
  with possible physical influences on climate forcings (Lean et al., 1995; Crowley 
  and Kim, 1996, 1999; Overpeck et al., 1997; Mann et al., 1998; Waple et al., 
  2001), and for new evaluations of the low-frequency climate variability exhibited 
  by numerical climate models (Barnett et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1998; Crowley 
  and Kim, 1999; Delworth and Mann, 2000).</p>
<h3><a name="232"></a>2.3.2 Temperature of the Past 1,000 Years</h3>
<p>The past 1,000 years are a particularly important time-frame for assessing 
  the background natural variability of the climate for climate change detection. 
  Astronomical boundary conditions have strayed relatively little from their modern-day 
  values over this interval (but see <a href="071.htm#234">Section 2.3.4</a> for 
  a possible caveat) and, with the latest evidence, the spatial extent of large-scale 
  climate change during the past millennium can now be meaningfully characterised 
  (Briffa et al., 1998b; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998; 1999; 2000a; 2000b). 
  Moreover, estimates of volcanic and solar climate forcings are also possible 
  over this period, allowing model-based estimates of their climate effects (Crowley 
  and Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 1999).</p>
