<h4>11.2.2.2 Sensitivity to temperature change</h4>
<p>A method of dealing with the lack of mass balance measurements is to estimate 
  the changes in mass balance as a function of climate, using mass balance sensitivities 
  (see <a href="413.htm#box112">Box 11.2</a> for definition) and observed or modelled 
  climate change for glacier covered regions. Mass-balance modelling of all glaciers 
  individually is not practical because no detailed description exists for the 
  great majority of them, and because local climate data are not available; even 
  regional climate models do not have sufficient resolution, while downscaling 
  methods cannot generally be used because local climate measurements have not 
  been made (see <a href="401.htm">Section 10.7</a>). A number of authors have 
  estimated past glacier net mass loss using past temperature change with present 
  day glacier covered areas and mass balance sensitivities (<a href="413.htm#tab114">Table 
  11.4).</a> In this report, we project future mass balance changes using regional 
  mass balance sensitivities which take account of regional and seasonal climatic 
  information, instead of using the heuristic model of Wigley and Raper (1995) 
  employed by Warrick et al. (1996).</p>
<p>Meier (1984) intuitively scaled specific mass balance according to mass balance 
  amplitude (half the difference between winter and summer specific mass balance). 
  Braithwaite and Zhang (1999) demonstrated a dependence of mass balance sensitivity 
  on mass balance amplitude. Oerlemans and Fortuin (1992) derived an empirical 
  relationship between the mass balance sensitivity of a glacier to temperature 
  change and the local average precipitation, which is the principal factor determining 
  its mass turnover rate. Zuo and Oerlemans (1997) extended this idea by distinguishing 
  the effects of temperature changes in summer and outside summer; the former 
  have a stronger influence on mass loss, in general. They made a calculation 
  of glacier net mass loss since 1865. For 1961 to 1990, they obtained a rate 
  of 0.3 mm/yr of sea level rise (i.e., a total of 8 mm, Oerlemans, 1999), very 
  similar to the result of Dyurgerov and Meier (1997b). Gregory and Oerlemans 
  (1998) applied local seasonal temperature changes over 1860 to 1990 calculated 
  by the HadCM2 AOGCM forced by changing greenhouse gases and aerosols (HadCM2 
  GS in <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>) to the glacier model of Zuo and 
  Oerlemans.</p>
<p>Zuo and Oerlemans (1997), Gregory and Oerlemans (1998) and Van de Wal and Wild 
  (2001) all stress that the global average glacier mass balance depends markedly 
  on the regional and seasonal distribution of temperature change. For instance, 
  Gregory and Oerlemans (1998) find that projected future glacier net mass loss 
  is 20% greater if local seasonal variation is neglected, and 20% less if regional 
  variation is not included. The first difference arises because annual average 
  temperature change is greater than summer temperature change at high latitudes, 
  but the mass balance sensitivity is greater to summer change. The second is 
  because the global average temperature change is less than the change at high 
  latitudes, where most glaciers are found (<a href="351.htm">Section 9.3.2</a>).</p>
<p>Both the observations of mass balance and the estimates based on temperature 
  changes (<a href="413.htm#tab114">Table 11.4</a>) indicate a reduction of mass 
  of glaciers and ice caps in the recent past, giving a contribution to global-average 
  sea level of 0.2 to 0.4 mm/yr over the last hundred years. </p>
<h4><a name="11223"></a>11.2.2.3 Sensitivity to precipitation change</h4>
<p>Precipitation and accumulation changes also influence glacier mass balance, 
  and may sometimes be dominant (e.g. Raper et al., 1996). Generally, glaciers 
  in maritime climates are more sensitive to winter accumulation than to summer 
  conditions (Kuhn, 1984). AOGCM experiments suggest that global-average annual 
  mean precipitation will increase on average by 1 to 3%/&deg;C under the enhanced 
  greenhouse effect (<a href="355.htm#fig918">Figure 9.18</a>). Glacier mass balance 
  modelling indicates that to compensate for the increased ablation from a temperature 
  rise of 1&deg;C a precipitation increase of 20% (Oerlemans, 1981) or 35% (Raper 
  et al., 2000) would be required. Van de Wal and Wild (2001) find that the effect 
  of precipitation changes on calculated global-average glacier mass changes in 
  the 21st century is only 5% of the temperature effect. Such results suggest 
  that the evolution of the global glacier mass is controlled principally by temperature 
  changes rather than precipitation changes. Precipitation changes might be significant 
  in particular localities, especially where precipitation is affected by atmospheric 
  circulation changes, as seems recently to have been the case with southern Scandinavian 
  glaciers (Oerlemans, 1999).</p>
