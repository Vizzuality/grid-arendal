<h4>5.5.2.2 Projection of VOC emissions in 2100<br>
</h4>
<p>Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, and other VOC were calculated using the 
  GLOBEIS model (Guenther et al., 1999) which estimates biogenic VOC emissions 
  as a function of foliar density, an emission capacity (the emission at specified 
  environmental conditions), and an emission activity factor that accounts for 
  variations due to environmental conditions. The foliar densities, emission capacities, 
  and algorithms used to determine emissions activities for both 2000 and 2100 
  are the same as those described by Guenther et al. (1995). One difference between 
  this work and that of Guenther et al. (1995) is that here we used hourly temperatures 
  for each hour of a month to determine the monthly average emission rate whereas 
  Guenther et al. (1995) used monthly average temperatures to drive emission algorithms. 
  This results in about a 20% increase in isoprene emissions in 2000 and 10% increase 
  in emissions of other biogenic VOC. <br>
</p>
<p> Global annual emissions of monoterpenes for 2000 were 146 Tg (compared to 
  the estimate of 127 Tg in Guenther et al. (1995) which was used for the workshop 
  2000 emissions). These increase by 23% for 2100 relative to the 2000 scenario. 
  The changes are much higher at certain seasons and locations. The spatial distribution 
  of changes in total monoterpene emissions range from a 17% decrease to a 200% 
  increase.<br>
</p>
<p> The simple model used for this analysis does not consider a number of other 
  factors that could significantly influence long-term trends in biogenic VOC 
  emissions. For example, we did not consider changes in soil moisture which could 
  significantly impact emission rates. In addition, we did not consider changes 
  in future concentrations of OH, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>3</sub> in determining 
  the yield of aerosol products. Instead, a constant yield of 11% of the terpene 
  emissions was assumed for all future emissions.</p>
<h4><a name="5523"></a>5.5.2.3 Projection of dust emissions in 2100<br>
</h4>
<p>The meteorological variables used to compute the dust emission for 2000 corresponded 
  to those computed for daily meteorological data from the Data Assimilation Office 
  analysis for 1990 (the GEOS-1 DAS, see Schubert et al., 1993) using algorithms 
  outlined by P. Ginoux. For this computation, the total dust flux was scaled 
  to yield a total emission of about 2000 Tg/yr. Emissions in four size categories 
  were specified (diameter 0.2 to 12.0 mm).<br>
</p>
<p> In order to calculate dust flux in 2100, the monthly mean variables were computed 
  by averaging the wind speed at the lowest level (100 m) and the soil moisture 
  content over the ten years ending in 1999 and 2099. The fluxes for the 21st 
  century were calculated using the same meteorological variables, corresponding 
  to 1990, scaled by the monthly mean ratio of the equivalent variables computed 
  by the NCAR CSM model.<br>
</p>
<p> Overall, predicted dust emissions increase by approximately 10%. There are 
  substantial increases in some seasons and locations (e.g. increases in Australia 
  (85%) in winter and in Europe (86%) and East Asia (42%) in summer). Because 
  dust may be especially important as an ice-nucleating agent in clouds, these 
  possible changes add substantial uncertainty to the projected future indirect 
  forcing.</p>
