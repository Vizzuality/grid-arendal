<h2>5.5 Aerosol Effects in Future Scenarios</h2>
<h3><a name="551"></a>5.5.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Aerosol concentrations and forcing will change in the future, both as a result 
  of changing emissions and as a result of changing climate. The uncertainties 
  associated with our knowledge of the present day distribution of aerosols noted 
  in previous sections will carry over into uncertainties in analysis of future 
  scenarios. Nonetheless, models are the best available tool for making an assessment 
  of what changes might follow. To estimate these future changes, we specified 
  a set of emissions for the IPCC model intercomparison workshop (<a href="188.htm#541">Section 
  5.4.1</a>) based on the draft scenarios developed for the IPCC Special Report 
  on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000). The 
  results from the workshop form the basis of the future aerosol forcing reported 
  in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 6</a> and contribute to the climate change scenarios 
  reported in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>.<br>
</p>
<p> Separate estimates for the amount of biomass-burning activity were not available 
  for the SRES scenarios (though growth in biomass burning was included in the 
  SRES analysis). Also, estimates of emissions of organic carbon and black carbon 
  aerosols from fossil fuels and industrial activity were not available. Therefore, 
  these were constructed using the ratio of source strengths for CO in 2030 and 
  2100 to that in 2000, respectively. This ratio was then used to scale the emissions 
  for organic carbon and black carbon from fossil fuel and biomass burning. Because 
  the scenarios do not provide a breakdown of emissions for CO by source category, 
  this scaling implicitly assumes that as a given region develops, the ratio of 
  emissions of CO by biomass burning and by fossil fuel burning remains roughly 
  constant. We note that our projected carbon particle emissions may be too large 
  if countries choose to target particle emissions for reduction to a greater 
  extent than they target emissions of CO.<br>
</p>
<p> In addition to the emissions of carbon particles, we constructed emissions 
  for NH<sub>3</sub> in order to examine possible changes in the emissions of 
  NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> to aerosol abundance and forcing. Only the 
  A2 scenario in 2100 was considered. For this simulation, the growth in anthropogenic 
  NH<sub>3</sub> emissions was assumed to follow the growth in anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O 
  emissions. Anthropogenic emissions grew from 46.9 TgN/yr in 2000 to 111.5 TgN/yr 
  in 2100. The anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were 39.5 TgN/yr in 2000 and grew to 
  109.7 TgN/yr in 2100.<br>
</p>
<p> The emissions for 2030 and 2100 from the draft A2 and B1 scenarios that were 
  considered in the IPCC workshop are shown in <a href="190.htm#tab57">Table 5.7</a> 
  (see the Appendix to this volume for the final SRES emissions). As noted there, 
  SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2030 are about a factor of 1.6 higher than those 
  in 2000 in the draft A2 scenario, but decrease thereafter to global average 
  levels that are less than the present-day estimates in 2100. Carbon aerosol 
  emissions grow by a factor of 1.3 in 2030 in the A2 scenario and continue to 
  grow to 2100 by an additional factor of 1.8. In the B1 scenario, both SO<sub>2</sub> 
  and carbon aerosol emissions are controlled by 2100, falling by 60 and 3%, respectively, 
  compared to 2000. For comparison, the table also shows emissions for the IS92a 
  scenario, with carbon aerosol emissions constructed as above for the SRES scenarios. 
  In the IS92a scenario, growth continues throughout the time period for both 
  SO<sub>2</sub> and carbon emissions: SO<sub>2</sub> and CO emissions are a factor 
  of 1.8 and 1.6 larger in 2100, respectively, than the same emissions in 2000.
