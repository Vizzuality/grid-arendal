<h3>11.3.2 Mean Sea Level Changes over the Past 100 to 200 Years </h3>

<p><a name="fig118"></a>The primary source of information on secular trends in 
  global sea level during the past century is the tide gauge data set of the Permanent 
  Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (Spencer and Woodworth, 1993). The tide gauge 
  measurement is of the level of the sea surface relative to that of the land 
  upon which the gauge is located and contains information on both the displacement 
  of the land and on changes in ocean volume (eustatic changes). The land displacement 
  may be of two types: that caused by active tectonics and that caused by glacial 
  rebound. Corrections for these effects are required if the change in ocean volume 
  is to be extracted from the tide gauge record. Both corrections are imperfectly 
  known and are based on sea level observations themselves, usually from long 
  geological records. Different strategies have been developed for dealing with 
  these corrections but differences remain that are not inconsequential (see <a href="422.htm#tab119">Table 
  11.9</a>). </p>
<p>The sea level records contain significant interannual and decadal variability 
  and long records are required in order to estimate reliable secular rates that 
  will be representative of the last century. In addition, sea level change is 
  spatially variable because of land movements and of changes in the ocean circulation. 
  Therefore, a good geographic distribution of observations is required. Neither 
  requirement is satisfied with the current tide gauge network and different strategies 
  have been developed to take these differences into consideration. Warrick et 
  al. (1996), Douglas (1995) and Smith et al. (2000) give recent reviews of the 
  subject, including discussions of the Northern Hemisphere geographical bias 
  in the historical data set.</p>
<p>In the absence of independent measurements of vertical land movements by advanced 
  geodetic techniques (<a href="436.htm#1161">Section 11.6.1</a>), corrections 
  for movements are based on either geological data or geophysical modelling. 
  The former method uses geological evidence from locations adjacent to the gauges 
  to estimate the long-term relative sea level change which is assumed to be caused 
  primarily by land movements, from whatever cause. This is subtracted from the 
  gauge records to estimate the eustatic change for the past century. However, 
  this procedure may underestimate the real current eustatic change because the 
  observed geological data may themselves contain a long-term component of eustatic 
  sea level rise (<a href="423.htm#1131">Section 11.3.1</a>). The latter method, 
  glacial rebound modelling, is also constrained by geological observations to 
  estimate earth response functions or ice load parameters, which may therefore 
  themselves contain a component of long-term eustatic sea level change unless 
  this component is specifically solved for (<a href="423.htm#1131">Section 11.3.1</a>).</p>
<p>A further underestimate of the rate of sea level rise from the geological approach, 
  compared to that from glacial rebound models, will pertain in forebulge areas, 
  and especially the North American east coast, where the linear extrapolation 
  of geological data could result in an underestimate of the corrected rate of 
  sea level change for the past century typically by 0.3 mm/yr because the glacial 
  rebound signal is diminishing with time (Peltier, 2000). However, in areas remote 
  from the former ice sheets this bias will be considerably smaller. </p>
<p>Also, in adding recent mass into the oceans, most studies have assumed that 
  it is distributed uniformly and have neglected the Earth's elastic and 
  gravitational response to the changed water loading (analogous to glacio-hydro-isostatic 
  effect). This will have the effect of reducing the observed rise at continental 
  margin sites from ongoing mass contributions by as much as 30% (cf. Nakiboglu 
  and Lambeck, 1991). </p>
<p><a href="422.htm#tab119">Table 11.9</a> summarises estimates of the corrected 
  sea level trends for the past century. Estimates cover a wide range as a result 
  of different assumptions and methods for calculating the rate of vertical land 
  movement, of different selections of gauge records for analysis, and of different 
  requirements for minimum record length. </p>

<p>There have been several more studies since the SAR of trends observed in particular 
  regions. Woodworth et al. (1999) provided a partial update to Shennan and Woodworth 
  (1992), suggesting that sea level change in the North Sea region has been about 
  1 mm/yr during the past century. Lambeck et al. (1998) combined coastal tide 
  gauge data from Fennoscandinavia together with lake level records and postglacial 
  rebound models to estimate an average regional rise for the past century of 
  1.1 &plusmn; 0.2 mm/yr. Studies of the North American east coast have been particularly 
  concerned with the spatial dependence of trends associated with the Laurentian 
  forebulge. Peltier (1996) concluded a current rate of order 1.9 &plusmn; 0.6 
  mm/yr, larger than the 1.5 mm/yr obtained by Gornitz (1995), who used the geological 
  data approach, and Mitrovica and Davis (1995), who employed Post Glacial Rebound 
  (PGR) modelling. Note that the observations of thermal expansion (<a href="411.htm#11211">Section 
  11.2.1.1</a>) indicate a higher rate of sea level rise over recent decades in 
  the sub-tropical gyres of the North Atlantic (i.e., off the North American east 
  coast) than the higher latitude sub-polar gyre. Thus the differences between 
  three lower European values compared with the higher North American values may 
  reflect a real regional difference (with spatial variations in regional sea 
  level change being perhaps several tenths of a millimetre per year - see 
  also <a href="432.htm#1152">Section 11.5.2</a>). In China, relative sea level 
  is rising at about 2 mm/yr in the south but less than 0.5 mm/yr in the north 
  (National Bureau of Marine Management, 1992), with an estimated average of the 
  whole coastline of 1.6 mm/yr (Zhen and Wu, 1993) and with attempts to remove 
  the spatially dependent component of vertical land movement yielding an average 
  of 2.0 mm/yr (Shi, 1996). The two longest records from Australia (both in excess 
  of 80 years in length and not included in Douglas, 1997) are from Sydney and 
  Fremantle, on opposite sides of the continent. They show observed rates of relative 
  sea level rise of 0.86 &plusmn; 0.12 mm/yr and 1.38 &plusmn; 0.18 mm/yr over 
  the periods 1915 to 1998 and 1897 to 1998 (Mitchell et al., 2000), corresponding 
  to approximately 1.26 mm/yr and 1.73 mm/yr after glacial rebound correction 
  using the Peltier ICE-4G/M2 model, or 1.07 mm/yr and 1.55 mm/yr using the corrections 
  of Lambeck and Nakada (1990). </p>
<p>There have been only two analyses of global sea level change based on the PSMSL 
  data set published since the SAR. Douglas (1997) provided an update to Douglas 
  (1991) and applied the PGR model of Tushingham and Peltier (1991) to a selected 
  set of twenty-four long tide gauge records, grouped into nine geographical areas, 
  with minimum record length 60 years and average length 83 years. However, the 
  only Southern Hemisphere sites included in this solution were from Argentina 
  and New Zealand. The overall global average of 1.8 &plusmn; 0.1 mm/yr agreed 
  with the 1991 analysis, with considerable consistency between area-average trends. 
  The standard error of the global rate was derived from the standard deviation 
  of regional trends, assuming that temporal and spatial variability is uncorrelated 
  between regions. Peltier and Jiang (1997) used essentially the same set of stations 
  as Douglas and a new model for postglacial rebound.</p>
<p>From <a href="422.htm#tab119">Table 11.9</a> one can see that there are six 
  global estimates determined with the use of PGR corrections derived from global 
  models of isostatic adjustment, spanning a range from 1.4 mm/yr (Mitrovica and 
  Davis, 1995; Davis and Mitrovica, 1996) to 2.4 mm/yr (Peltier and Tushingham, 
  1989, 1991). We consider that these five are consistent within the systematic 
  uncertainty of the PGR models, which may have a range of uncertainty of 0.5 
  mm/yr depending on earth structure parametrization employed (Mitrovica and Davis, 
  1995). The average rate of the five estimates is 1.8 mm/yr. There are two other 
  global analyses, of Gornitz and Lebedeff (1987) and Nakiboglu and Lambeck (1991), 
  which yield estimates of 1.2 mm/yr, lower than the first group. Because of the 
  issues raised above with regard to the geological data method for land movement 
  correction, the value of Gornitz and Lebedeff may be underestimated by up to 
  a few tenths of a millimetre per year, although such considerations do not affect 
  the method of Nakiboglu and Lambeck. The differences between the former five 
  and latter two analyses reflect the analysis methods, in particular the differences 
  in corrections for land movements and in selections of tide gauges used, including 
  the effect of any spatial variation in thermal expansion. However, all the discrepancies 
  which could arise as a consequence of different analysis methods remain to be 
  more thoroughly investigated. On the basis of the published literature, we therefore 
  cannot rule out an average rate of sea level rise of as little as 1.0 mm/yr 
  during the 20th century. For the upper bound, we adopt a limit of 2.0 mm/yr, 
  which includes all recent global estimates with some allowance for systematic 
  uncertainty. As with other ranges (see <a href="410.htm#box111">Box 11.1</a>), 
  we do not imply that the central value is the best estimate.</p>
