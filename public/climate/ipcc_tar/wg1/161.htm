<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter provides a synopsis of aerosol observations, source inventories, 
  and the theoretical understanding required to enable an assessment of radiative 
  forcing from aerosols and its uncertainty.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The chemical and physical properties of aerosols are needed to estimate 
    and predict direct and indirect climate forcing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aerosols are liquid or solid particles suspended in the air. They have a direct 
  radiative forcing because they scatter and absorb solar and infrared radiation 
  in the atmosphere. Aerosols also alter warm, ice and mixed-phase cloud formation 
  processes by increasing droplet number concentrations and ice particle concentrations. 
  They decrease the precipitation efficiency of warm clouds and thereby cause 
  an indirect radiative forcing associated with these changes in cloud properties. 
  Aerosols have most likely made a significant negative contribution to the overall 
  radiative forcing. An important characteristic of aerosols is that they have 
  short atmospheric lifetimes and therefore cannot be considered simply as a long-term 
  offset to the warming influence of greenhouse gases.<br>
</p>
<p> The size distribution of aerosols is critical to all climate influences. Sub-micrometre 
  aerosols scatter more light per unit mass and have a longer atmospheric lifetime 
  than larger aerosols. The number of cloud condensation nuclei per mass of aerosol 
  also depends on the chemical composition of aerosols as a function of size. 
  Therefore, it is essential to understand the processes that determine these 
  properties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since the last IPCC report, there has been a greater appreciation of aerosol 
    species other than sulphate, including sea salt, dust, and carbonaceous material. 
    Regionally resolved emissions have been estimated for these species.</li>
</ul>
<p>For sulphate, uncertainties in the atmospheric transformation of anthropogenic 
  sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to sulphate are larger than the 20 
  to 30% uncertainties in the emissions themselves. SO<sub>2</sub> from volcanoes 
  has a disproportionate impact on sulphate aerosols due to the high altitude 
  of the emissions, resulting in low SO<sub>2</sub> losses to dry deposition and 
  a long aerosol lifetime. Modelled dust concentrations are systematically too 
  high in the Southern Hemisphere, indicating that source strengths developed 
  for the Sahara do not accurately predict dust uplift in other arid areas. Owing 
  to a sensitive, non-linear dependence on wind speed of the flux of sea salt 
  from ocean to atmosphere, estimates of global sea salt emissions from two present 
  day estimates of wind speed differed by 55%. The two available inventories of 
  black carbon emissions agree to 25% but the uncertainty is certainly greater 
  than that and is subjectively estimated as a factor of two. The accuracy of 
  source estimates for organic aerosol species has not been assessed, but organic 
  species are believed to contribute significantly to both direct and indirect 
  radiative forcing. Aerosol nitrate is regionally important but its global impact 
  is uncertain.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a great spatial and temporal variability in aerosol concentrations. 
    Global measurements are not available for many aerosol properties, so models 
    must be used to interpolate and extrapolate the available data. Such models 
    now include the types of aerosols most important for climate change. </li>
</ul>
<p>A model intercomparison was carried out as part of preparation for this assessment. 
  All participating models simulated surface mass concentrations of non-sea-salt 
  sulphate to within 50% of observations at most locations. Whereas sulphate aerosol 
  models are now commonplace and reasonably well-tested, models of both organic 
  and black carbon aerosol species are in early stages of development. They are 
  not well-tested because there are few reliable measurements of black carbon 
  or organic aerosols.</p>
<p> The vertical distribution of aerosol concentrations differs substantially 
  from one model to the next, especially for components other than sulphate. For 
  summertime tropopause conditions the range of model predictions is a factor 
  of five for sulphate. The range of predicted concentrations is even larger for 
  some of the other aerosol species. However, there are insufficient data to evaluate 
  this aspect of the models. It will be important to narrow the uncertainties 
  associated with this aspect of models in order to improve the assessment of 
  aircraft effects, for example.</p>
<p> Although there are quite large spreads between the individual short-term observed 
  and model-predicted concentrations at individual surface stations (in particular 
  for carbonaceous aerosols), the calculated global burdens for most models agree 
  to within a factor of 2.5 for sulphate, organics, and black carbon. The model-calculated 
  range increases to three and to five for dust and sea salt with diameters less 
  than 2 mm, respectively. The range for sea salt increases to a factor of six 
  when different present day surface wind data sets are used. </p>
<ul>
  <li> An analysis of the contributions of the uncertainties in the different 
    factors needed to estimate direct forcing to the overall uncertainty in the 
    direct forcing estimates can be made. This analysis leads to an overall uncertainty 
    estimate for fossil fuel aerosols of 89% (or a range from -0.1 to -1.0 
    Wm<sup>-2</sup>) while that for biomass aerosols is 85% (or a range from 
    -0.1 to -0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> ).</li>
</ul>
