<h4>4.2.6.1 Laboratory data and the OH lifetime of greenhouse gases</h4>
<p>Laboratory data on the rates of chemical reactions and photodissociation provide 
  a cornerstone for the chemical models used here. Subsequent to the SAR there 
  have been a number of updates to the recommended chemical rate databases of 
  the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC 1997a,b, 1999) 
  and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (DeMore et al., 1997; Sander et al., 
  2000). The CTMs in the OxComp workshop generally used the JPL-1997 database 
  (JPL, 1997) with some updated rates similar to JPL-2000 (JPL, 2000). The most 
  significant changes or additions to the databases include: (i) revision of the 
  low temperature reaction rate coefficients for OH + NO<sub>2</sub> leading to 
  enhancement of HO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> abundances in the lower stratosphere 
  and upper troposphere; (ii) extension of the production of O(<sup>1</sup>D) 
  from O<sub>3</sub> photodissociation to longer wavelengths resulting in enhanced 
  OH production in the upper troposphere; and (iii) identification of a new heterogeneous 
  reaction involving hydrolysis of BrONO<sub>2</sub> which serves to enhance HO<sub>x</sub> 
  and suppress NO<sub>x</sub> in the lower stratosphere. These database improvements, 
  along with many other smaller refinements, do not change the overall understanding 
  of atmospheric chemical processes but do impact the modelled tropospheric OH 
  abundances and the magnitude of calculated O<sub>3</sub> changes by as much 
  as 20% under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Reaction rate coefficients used in this chapter to calculate atmospheric lifetimes 
  for gases destroyed by tropospheric OH are from the 1997 and 2000 NASA/JPL evaluations 
  (DeMore et al., 1997; Sander et al., 2000) and from Orkin et al. (1999) for 
  HFE-356mff2. These rate coefficients are sensitive to atmospheric temperature 
  and can be ten times faster near the surface than in the upper troposphere. 
  The global mean abundance of OH cannot be directly measured, but a weighted 
  average of the OH sink for certain synthetic trace gases (whose budgets are 
  well established and whose total atmospheric sinks are essentially controlled 
  by OH) can be derived. The ratio of the atmospheric lifetimes against tropospheric 
  OH loss for a gas is scaled to that of CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> by the 
  inverse ratio of their OH-reaction rate coefficients at an appropriate scaling 
  temperature. A new analysis of the modelled global OH distribution predicts 
  relatively greater abundances at mid-levels in the troposphere (where it is 
  colder) and results in a new scaling temperature for the rate coefficients of 
  272K (Spivakovsky et al., 2000), instead of 277K (Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990; 
  SAR). The atmospheric lifetimes reported in <a href="130.htm#tab41a">Table 4.1</a> 
  use this approach, adopting an "OH lifetime" of 5.7 years for CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> 
  (Prinn et al., 1995; WMO, 1999). Stratospheric losses for all gases are taken 
  from published values (Ko et al., 1999; WMO, 1999) or calculated as 8% of the 
  tropospheric loss (with a minimum lifetime of 30 years). The only gases in <a href="130.htm#tab41a">Table 
  4.1</a> with surface losses are CH<sub>4</sub> (a soil-sink lifetime of 160 
  years) and CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> (an ocean-sink lifetime of 85 years). 
  The lifetime for nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) is taken from Molina 
  et al. (1995). These lifetimes agree with the recent compendium of Naik et al. 
  (2000).</p>
<p>Analysis of the CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> burden and trend (Prinn et al., 
  1995; Krol et al., 1998; Montzka et al., 2000) has provided a cornerstone of 
  our empirical derivations of the OH lifetimes of most gases. Quantification 
  of the "OH-lifetime" of CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> has evolved over the past 
  decade. The SAR adopted a value of 5.9 &plusmn; 0.7 years in calculating the 
  lifetimes of the greenhouse gases. This range covered the updated analysis of 
  Prinn et al. (1995), 5.7 years, which was used in WMO (1999) and adopted for 
  this report. Montzka et al. (2000) extend the atmospheric record of CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> 
  to include the rapid decay over the last five years following cessation of emissions 
  and derive an OH lifetime of 6.3 years. The new information on the CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> 
  lifetime by Montzka et al. (2000) has not been incorporated into this report, 
  but it falls within the &plusmn;15% uncertainty for these lifetimes. If the 
  new value of 6.3 years were adopted, then the lifetime of CH<sub>4</sub> would 
  increase to 9.2 yr, and all lifetimes, perturbation lifetimes, and GWPs for 
  gases controlled by tropospheric OH would be about 10% greater.</p>
