<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Considerable advances have been made in the understanding of processes and 
  feedbacks in the climate system. This has led to a better representation of 
  processes and feedbacks in numerical climate models, which have become much 
  more comprehensive. Because of the presence of non-linear processes in the climate 
  system, deterministic projections of changes are potentially subject to uncertainties 
  arising from sensitivity to initial conditions or to parameter settings. Such 
  uncertainties can be partially quantified from ensembles of climate change integrations, 
  made using different models starting from different initial conditions. They 
  necessarily give rise to probabilistic estimates of climate change. This results 
  in more quantitative estimates of uncertainties and more reliable projections 
  of anthropogenic climate change. While improved parametrizations have built 
  confidence in some areas, recognition of the complexity in other areas has not 
  indicated an overall reduction or shift in the current range of uncertainty 
  of model response to changes in atmospheric composition.<br>
</p>
<p> Atmospheric feedbacks largely control climate sensitivity. Important progress 
  has been made in the understanding of those processes, partly by utilising new 
  data against which models can be compared. Since the Second Assessment Report 
  (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR), there has been a better appreciation of the complexity 
  of the mechanisms controlling water vapour distribution. Within the boundary 
  layer, water vapour increases with increasing temperatures. In the free troposphere 
  above the boundary layer, where the greenhouse effect of water vapour is most 
  important, the situation is less amenable to straightforward thermodynamic arguments. 
  In models, increases in water vapour in this region are the most important reason 
  for large responses to increased greenhouse gases. <br>
</p>
<p> Water vapour feedback, as derived from current models, approximately doubles 
  the warming from what it would be for fixed water vapour. Since the SAR, major 
  improvements have occurred in the treatment of water vapour in models, although 
  detrainment of moisture from clouds remains quite uncertain and discrepancies 
  exist between model water vapour distributions and those observed. It is likely 
  that some of the apparent discrepancy is due to observational error and shortcomings 
  in intercomparison methodology. Models are capable of simulating the moist and 
  very dry regions observed in the tropics and sub-tropics and how they evolve 
  with the seasons and from year to year, indicating that the models have successfully 
  incorporated the basic processes governing water vapour distribution. While 
  reassuring, this does not provide a definitive check of the feedbacks, though 
  the balance of evidence favours a positive clear-sky water vapour feedback of 
  a magnitude comparable to that found in simulations.<br>
</p>
<p> Probably the greatest uncertainty in future projections of climate arises 
  from clouds and their interactions with radiation. Cloud feedbacks depend upon 
  changes in cloud height, amount, and radiative properties, including short-wave 
  absorption. The radiative properties depend upon cloud thickness, particle size, 
  shape, and distribution and on aerosol effects. The evolution of clouds depends 
  upon a host of processes, mainly those governing the distribution of water vapour. 
  The physical basis of the cloud parametrizations included into the models has 
  also been greatly improved. However, this increased physical veracity has not 
  reduced the uncertainty attached to cloud feedbacks: even the sign of this feedback 
  remains unknown. A key issue, which also has large implications for changes 
  in precipitation, is the sensitivity of sub-grid scale dynamical processes, 
  turbulent and convective, to climate change. It depends on sub-grid features 
  of surface conditions such as orography. Equally important are microphysical 
  processes, which have only recently been introduced explicitly in the models, 
  and carry major uncertainties. The possibility that models underestimate solar 
  absorption in clouds remains controversial, as does the effect of such an underestimate 
  on climate sensitivity. The importance of the structure of the stratosphere 
  and both radiative and dynamical processes have been recognised, and limitations 
  in representing stratospheric processes add some uncertainty to model results.<br>
</p>
<p> Considerable improvements have taken place in modelling ocean processes. In 
  conjunction with an increase in resolution, these improvements have, in some 
  models, allowed a more realistic simulation of the transports and air-sea fluxes 
  of heat and fresh water, thereby reducing the need for flux adjustments in coupled 
  models. These improvements have also contributed to better simulations of natural 
  large-scale circulation patterns such as El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation 
  (ENSO) and the oceanic response to atmospheric variability associated with the 
  North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, significant deficiencies in ocean 
  models remain. Boundary currents in climate simulations are much weaker and 
  wider than in nature, though the consequences of this fact for the global climate 
  sensitivity are not clear. Improved parametrizations of important sub-grid scale 
  processes, such as mesoscale eddies, have increased the realism of simulations 
  but important details are still under debate. Major uncertainties still exist 
  with the representation of small-scale processes, such as overflows and flow 
  through narrow channels (e.g., between Greenland and Iceland), western boundary 
  currents (i.e., large-scale narrow currents along coastlines), convection, and 
  mixing.</p>
