<p> In the Atlantic, the thermohaline circulation (THC) is responsible for the 
  major part of the ocean meridional heat transport associated with warm and saline 
  surface waters flowing northward and cold and fresh waters from the North Atlantic 
  returning at depth. The interplay between the large-scale atmospheric forcing, 
  with warming and evaporation in low latitudes, and cooling and net precipitation 
  at high latitudes, forms the basis of a potential instability of the present 
  Atlantic THC. Changes in ENSO may also influence the Atlantic THC by altering 
  the fresh water balance of the tropical Atlantic, therefore providing a coupling 
  between low and high latitudes. Uncertainty resides with the relative importance 
  of feedbacks associated with processes influencing changes in high latitude 
  sea surface temperatures and salinities, such as atmosphere-ocean heat and fresh 
  water fluxes, formation and transport of sea ice, continental runoff and the 
  large-scale transports in ocean and atmosphere. The Atlantic THC is likely to 
  change over the coming century but its evolution continues to be an unresolved 
  issue. While some recent calculations find little changes in the THC, most projections 
  suggest a gradual and significant decline of the THC. A complete shut-down of 
  the THC is simulated in a number of models if the warming continues, but knowledge 
  about the locations of thresholds for such a shut-down is very limited. Models 
  with reduced THC appear to be more susceptible for a shut-down. Although a shut-down 
  during the next 100 years is unlikely, it cannot be ruled out.<br>
</p>
<p> Recent advances in our understanding of vegetation photosynthesis and water 
  use have been used to couple the terrestrial energy, water and carbon cycles 
  within a new generation of physiologically based land-surface parametrizations. 
  These have been tested against field observations and implemented in General 
  Circulation Models (GCMs) with demonstrable improvements in the simulation of 
  land-atmosphere fluxes. There has also been significant progress in specifying 
  land parameters, especially the type and density of vegetation. Importantly, 
  these data sets are globally consistent in that they are primarily based on 
  one type of satellite sensor and one set of interpretative algorithms. Satellite 
  observations have also been shown to provide a powerful diagnostic capability 
  for tracking climatic impacts on surface conditions; e.g., droughts and the 
  recently observed lengthening of the boreal growing season; and direct anthropogenic 
  impacts such as deforestation. The direct effects of increased carbon dioxide 
  (CO<sub>2</sub>) on vegetation physiology could lead to a relative reduction in evapo-transpiration 
  over the tropical continents, with associated regional warming over that predicted 
  for conventional greenhouse warming effects. On time-scales of decades these 
  effects could significantly influence the rate of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase, 
  the nature and extent of the physical climate system response, and ultimately, 
  the response of the biosphere itself to global change. In addition, such models 
  must be used to account for the climatic effects of land-use change which can 
  be very significant at local and regional scales. However, realistic land-use 
  change scenarios for the next 50 to 100 years are not expected to give rise 
  to global scale climate changes comparable to those resulting from greenhouse 
  gas warming. Significant modelling problems remain to be solved in the areas 
  of soil moisture processes, runoff prediction, land-use change, and the treatment 
  of snow and sub-grid scale heterogeneity.<br>
</p>
<p> Increasingly complex snow schemes are being used in some climate models. These 
  schemes include parametrizations of the metamorphic changes in snow albedo arising 
  from age dependence or temperature dependence. Recent modelling studies of the 
  effects of warming on permafrost predict a 12 to 15% reduction in near-surface 
  area and a 15 to 30% increase in thickness of the seasonally thawing active 
  layer by the mid-21st century. The representation of sea-ice processes continues 
  to improve with several climate models now incorporating physically based treatments 
  of ice dynamics. The effects of sub-grid scale variability in ice cover and 
  thickness, which can significantly influence albedo and atmosphere-ocean exchanges, 
  are being introduced. Understanding of fast-flow processes for land ice and 
  the role of these processes in past climate events is growing rapidly. Representation 
  of ice stream and grounding line physics in land-ice dynamics models remains 
  rudimentary but, in global climate models, ice dynamics and thermodynamics are 
  ignored entirely.<br>
</p>
<p> Climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means as well as changing 
  preference of specific regimes, as evidenced by the observed trend toward positive 
  values for the last 30 years in the NAO index and the climate "shift" 
  in the tropical Pacific in about 1976. While coupled models simulate features 
  of observed natural climate variability such as the NAO and ENSO, suggesting 
  that many of the relevant processes are included in the models, further progress 
  is needed to depict these natural modes accurately. Moreover, because ENSO and 
  NAO are key determinants of regional climate change, and they can possibly result 
  in abrupt and counter-intuitive changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty 
  in those aspects of climate change that critically depend on regional changes. 
  <br>
</p>
<p> Possible non-linear changes in the climate system as a result of anthropogenic 
  climate forcing have received considerable attention in the last few years. 
  Employing the entire climate model hierarchy, and combining these results with 
  palaeo-climatic evidence and instrumental observation, has shown that mode changes 
  in all components of the climate system have occurred in the past and may also 
  take place in the future. Such changes may be associated with thresholds in 
  the climate system. Such thresholds have been identified in many climate models 
  and there is an increasing understanding of the underlying processes. Current 
  model simulations indicate that the thresholds may lie within the reaches of 
  projected changes. However, it is not yet possible to give reliable values of 
  such thresholds.</p>
