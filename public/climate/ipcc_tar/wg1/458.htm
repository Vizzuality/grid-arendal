<h3>12.4.2 Pattern Correlation Methods </h3>
<h4><a name="12421"></a>12.4.2.1 Horizontal patterns</h4>
<p>Results from studies using pattern correlations were reported extensively in 
  the SAR (for example, Santer et al., 1995, 1996c; Mitchell et al., 1995b). They 
  found that the patterns of simulated surface temperature change due to the main 
  anthropogenic factors in recent decades are significantly closer to those observed 
  than expected by chance. Pattern correlations have been used because they are 
  simple and are insensitive to errors in the amplitude of the spatial pattern 
  of response and, if centred, to the global mean response. They are also less 
  sensitive than regression-based optimal detection techniques to sampling error 
  in the model-simulated response. The aim of pattern-correlation studies is to 
  use the differences in the large-scale patterns of response, or "fingerprints", 
  to distinguish between different causes of climate change. </p>
<p><i>Strengths and weaknesses of correlation methods</i><br>
  Pattern correlation statistics come in two types - centred and uncentred 
  (see <a href="470.htm">Appendix 12.3</a>). The centred (uncentred) statistic 
  measures the similarity of two patterns after (without) removal of the global 
  mean. Legates and Davis (1997) criticised the use of centred correlation in 
  detection studies. They argued that correlations could increase while observed 
  and simulated global means diverge. This was precisely the reason centred correlations 
  were introduced (e.g., Santer et al., 1993): to provide an indicator that was 
  statistically independent of global mean temperature changes. If both global 
  mean changes and centred pattern correlations point towards the same explanation 
  of observed temperature changes, it provides more compelling evidence than either 
  of these indicators in isolation. An explicit analysis of the role of the global 
  mean in correlation-based studies can be provided by the use of both centred 
  and uncentred statistics. Pattern correlation-based detection studies account 
  for spatial auto-correlation implicitly by comparing the observed pattern correlation 
  with values that are realised in long control simulations (see Wigley et al., 
  2000). These studies do not consider the amplitude of anthropogenic signals, 
  and thus centred correlations alone are not sufficient for the attribution of 
  climate change. </p>
<p>Wigley et al. (1998b) studied the performance of correlation statistics in 
  an idealised study in which known spatial signal patterns were combined with 
  realistic levels of internal variability. The statistics were found to perform 
  well even when the signal is contaminated with noise. They found, in agreement 
  with Johns et al. (2001), that using an earlier base period can enhance detectability, 
  but that much of this advantage is lost when the reduced data coverage of earlier 
  base periods is taken into account. They also found that reasonable combinations 
  of greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns are more easily detected than the greenhouse 
  gas pattern on its own. This last result indicates the importance of reducing 
  the uncertainty in the estimate of aerosol forcing, particularly the indirect 
  effects. In summary, we have a better understanding of the behaviour of pattern 
  correlation statistics and reasons for the discrepancies between different studies.
