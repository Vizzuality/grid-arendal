<h4>7.2.1.3 Summary on water vapour feedbacks</h4>
<p>The decade since the First IPCC Assessment Report (IPCC, 1990) has seen progressive 
  evolution in sophistication of thinking about water vapour feedback. Concern 
  about the role of upper-tropospheric humidity has stimulated much theoretical, 
  model diagnostic and observational study. The period since the SAR has seen 
  continued improvement in the analysis of observations of water vapour from sondes 
  and satellite instrumentation. Theoretical understanding of the atmospheric 
  hydrological cycle has also increased. As a result, observational tests of how 
  well models represent the processes governing water vapour content have become 
  more sophisticated and more meaningful. Since the SAR, appraisal of the confidence 
  in simulated water vapour feedback has shifted from a diffuse concern about 
  upper-tropospheric humidity to a more focused concern about the role of microphysical 
  processes in the convection parametrizations, and particularly those affecting 
  tropical deep convection. Further progress will almost certainly require abandoning 
  the artificial diagnostic separation between water vapour and cloud feedbacks.</p>
<p> In the SAR, a crude distinction was made between the effect of "upper-tropospheric" 
  and "lower-tropospheric" water vapour, and it was implied that lower-tropospheric 
  water vapour feedback was a straightforward consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron 
  relation. It is now appreciated that it is only in the boundary layer that the 
  control of water vapour by Clausius-Clapeyron can be regarded as straightforward, 
  so that "lower-tropospheric" feedback is no less subtle than "upper-tropospheric". 
  It is more meaningful to separate the problem instead into "boundary layer" 
  and "free tropospheric" water vapour, with the former contributing 
  little to the feedback.</p>
<p> The successes of the current models lend some confidence to their results. 
  For a challenge to the current view of water vapour feedback to succeed, relevant 
  processes would have to be incorporated into a GCM, and it would have to be 
  shown that the resulting GCM accounted for observations at least as well as 
  the current generation. A challenge that meets this test has not yet emerged. 
  Therefore, the balance of evidence favours a positive clear-sky water vapour 
  feedback of magnitude comparable to that found in simulations.</p>
