<p>Recent estimates indicate that 25% of the world's mammals and 12% of birds 
  are at significant risk of global extinction. Climate change is only one of 
  a long list of pressures on wildlife. Other pressures include exploitation of 
  animals, pollution and other biochemical poisonings, extreme climatic events, 
  wildlife diseases, collisions with towers and other structures, anthropogenic 
  barriers to dispersal, and war and other civil conflicts. Alone or in combination, 
  these pressures will greatly increase species' vulnerabilities to rarity 
  and extinction (high confidence). Habitat conversion and degradation affect 
  nearly 89% of all threatened birds and 83% of all threatened mammals. About 
  one-fifth of threatened mammals in Australia and the Americas and the world's 
  birds are affected by introduced species.</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities</i>
<ul>
  <li>Many animals already may be responding to local climatic changes. The types 
    of changes already observed include poleward and elevational movement of ranges, 
    changes in animal abundance, changes in body size, and shifts in the timing 
    of events, such as earlier breeding in spring. Possible climatically associated 
    shifts in animal ranges and densities have been noted on many continents and 
    within each major taxonomic group of animals (see <a href="203.htm#tab53">Table 
    5-3</a>). </li>
  <li>Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that climate plays a strong 
    role in limiting species' ranges (high confidence). Even though only a small 
    fraction of all species have been monitored long enough to detect significant 
    trends, changes exhibited over the past few decades in the bulk of these species 
    are consistent with local warming and expected physiological responses (medium 
    confidence). However, possible specific changes in wildlife from climate change 
    can be projected only with low confidence for most species because of many 
    possible contributing factors, such as habitat destruction and introduction 
    of exotic species. Some species clearly are responding to global change (see 
    <a href="220.htm">Section 5.4.3</a>), and many more changes probably have 
    gone undetected. Researchers are in the process of coupling these discernible 
    changes with various biological theories regarding climate and species spatial 
    and temporal patterns; through this process, we expect that reliable general 
    projections can be and in fact are being made. </li>
  <li>Protecting threatened and endangered species requires measures that, in 
    general, reverse the trend toward rarity. Without management, rapid climate 
    change&#151;in conjunction with other pressures&#151;is likely to cause many 
    species that currently are classified as critically endangered to become extinct 
    and several labeled endangered or vulnerable to become much rarer, and thereby 
    closer to extinction, in the 21st century (high confidence). </li>
  <li>Concern over species becoming rare or extinct is warranted because of the 
    goods and services provided by ecosystems and the species themselves. Most 
    of the goods and services provided by wildlife (e.g., pollination, natural 
    pest control) are derived from their roles within systems. Other valuable 
    services are provided by species contributing to ecosystem stability or to 
    ecosystem health and productivity. The recreational value (e.g., sport hunting, 
    wildlife viewing) of species is large in market and nonmarket terms. Species 
    loss also could impact the cultural and religious practices of indigenous 
    peoples around the world. Losses of species can lead to changes in the structure 
    and function of affected ecosystems and loss of revenue and aesthetics. Understanding 
    the role each species plays in ecosystem services is necessary to understand 
    the risks and possible surprises associated with species loss. Without this 
    information, the probability of surprises associated with species loss is 
    high (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>Humans may need to adapt not only in terms of wildlife conservation but 
    also to replace lost ecological services normally provided by wildlife. It 
    may be necessary to develop adaptations to losses to natural pest control, 
    pollination, and seed dispersal. Although replacing providers of these services 
    sometimes may be possible, the alternatives may be costly. Finding replacements 
    for other services, such as contributions to nutrient cycling and ecosystem 
    stability/ biodiversity, are much harder to imagine. In many cases, such as 
    the values of wildlife associated with subsistence hunting and cultural and 
    religious ceremonies, any attempt at replacement may represent a net loss. 
    In many countries, climate change impacts, such as reductions in wildlife 
    populations, may have the greatest impact on the lowest income groups&#151;those 
    with the least ability to adapt if hunting opportunities decline.</li>
</ul>
<b>Rangelands </b>
<p>Most rangelands in the world have been affected by human activity, and many 
  are degraded in some way. Desertification tends to be associated with land degradation 
  in rangelands; however, desertification combines many land degradation processes 
  and can be exacerbated by climate change. Many of the rangelands of the world 
  are affected by ENSO events and are sensitive to the frequency of these events, 
  resulting in changes in productivity of these systems.<br>
</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities </i>
<ul>
  <li>Based on observations and modeling studies, the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and climate change could result in increased plant productivity and thus an 
    increase in soil carbon sequestration in many rangelands. However, some of 
    the gains in productivity would be offset by increases in temperatures and 
    by human management activities (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>Modeling studies and observations suggest that plant production, species 
    distribution, disturbance regimes (e.g., frequencies of fires, insect/pest 
    outbreaks), grassland boundaries, and nonintensive animal production would 
    be affected by potential changes in climate and land use. The impacts of climate 
    change are likely to be minor compared to those of land degradation (high 
    confidence).</li>
  <li>Irrigation in semi-arid climates is a major cause of secondary salinization. 
    Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may reduce the impacts of secondary salinization, although experimental 
    work shows that any increase in temperature may negate these benefits and 
    may even exacerbate problems of secondary salinity (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>In many parts of the world that are dominated by rangelands, lack of infrastructure 
    and investment in resource management limits available options for adaptation 
    and makes these areas more sensitive and vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
    change (high confidence). Some adaptation options (e.g., integrated land management) 
    could be implemented irrespective of technology and infrastructure. Other 
    adaptation options could be implemented through active involvement of communities 
    in the management of rangelands.</li>
