<h3>2.5.5. Equity and Distribution</h3>
<p>Assessments of the impacts of alternative climate change scenarios require 
  assessments of their impacts on different groups, societies, nations, and even 
  species. Indeed, this report reveals that many sectors and/or regions are at 
  greater risk to climate change than others. This section addresses this need.</p>
<h4><a name="2551"></a>2.5.5.1. Interpersonal Comparisons</h4>
<p>First principles of economic theory offer two approaches for comparing situations 
  in which different people are affected differently. In the first&#151;the utilitarian 
  approach attributed to Bentham (1822) and expanded by Mills (1861)&#151;a situation 
  in which the sum of all individual utilities is larger is preferred. Because 
  Bentham's view of utility reflected "pleasure" and "pain," 
  this approach embraces the "greatest happiness principle." Many objections 
  have been raised against it, however, primarily because the whole notion of 
  interpersonal comparisons of utility is problematic. Indeed, Arrow (1951 and 
  1963) objected strenuously in arguing that "interpersonal comparisons in 
  the measurement of utilities has <i>no meaning</i> and, in fact, there is no 
  meaning relevant to welfare comparisons in the measurability of individual utility." 
  For example, it is impossible to compare the pleasure that a person receives 
  from listening to a concert with what another gets from watching a dance. Second, 
  maximizing the sum total of utility, if it were possible, would require that 
  the marginal utilities of all individuals be equal. But this would say nothing 
  about the level of utility for each individual. They could be quite different, 
  so the utilitarian rule is insensitive to distributional issues except in the 
  special case in which all individuals have identical utility functions.</p>
<p>These difficulties led to the development of a second approach&#151;the welfarist 
  approach, in which a social welfare function of individual utilities is postulated. 
  Utilitarianism is thus a special case in which the social welfare function is 
  simply the sum of individual utilities. There are other options, of course. 
  The Gandhian principle, for example, can support a function that judges every 
  possible action on the basis of its impact on the poorest of the poor.</p>
<p>It also is possible to compare two situations without defining an explicit 
  social welfare function and without making interpersonal comparisons of individual 
  utilities. The Pareto principle offers one method, by which one judges any situation 
  better than another if at least one person is better off and no one else is 
  worse off. A partial social ordering with which unambiguous comparisons can 
  be made in some (but not all) cases can be constructed from the Pareto principle 
  if cardinal utilities can be added across individuals, if society accepts the 
  principle of anonymity (i.e., only the distribution matters, not which particular 
  person is in a particular place), and if there is an aversion to regressive 
  transfers (i.e., transfers from the poor to the rich). To see how, consider 
  two situations, X and Y. Assume that there are <sub>n</sub> individuals ordered 
  from poorest to richest. Let them have incomes (or utilities) {X<sub>1</sub>, 
  ..., X<sub>n</sub>} and {Y<sub>1</sub>, ..., Y<sub>n</sub>} in X and Y, respectively. 
  X can be deemed preferable to Y if X<sub>1</sub> <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/images/gtoe.gif" width="8" height="12"> 
  Y<sub>1</sub>, [X<sub>1</sub> + X<sub>2</sub>] <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/images/gtoe.gif" width="8" height="12"> 
  [Y<sub>1</sub> + Y<sub>2</sub>], and so on through [X<sub>1</sub> +...+ X<sub>n</sub>] 
  <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/images/gtoe.gif" width="8" height="12"> [Y<sub>1</sub> +...+ Y<sub>n</sub>], 
  with at least one strict inequality holding. Note that showing that X is not 
  preferred to Y is not sufficient to show that Y is preferred to X</p>
<p>Rothschild and Stiglitz (1973) took these notions further by showing three 
  alternative but equivalent ways of comparing distributions X and Y. They concluded 
  that X would be preferred to Y if all of the following obtain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Lorenz curve for X were inside the Lorenz curve for Y.</li>
  <li>All those who valued equality preferred X to Y.</li>
  <li>Y could be obtained from X by transfers from the poor to the rich.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, in passing, that Lorenz curves simply plot the percentage of income received 
  by various percentiles of populations when they are ordered from least to greatest. 
  Rothschild and Stiglitz (1973) also point out, however, that these measures 
  apply only to a one-good economy. This requirement is equivalent to assuming 
  that income is desired by all individuals and there are no externalities; the 
  implications of more than one good are "substantial." </p>
<p>None of these measures speaks to estimating the cost of inequity when comparisons 
  can be made. But just as insurance can be used as a utility-based measure of 
  the cost of uncertainty, similarly constructed estimates that are based on social 
  welfare functions that display aversion to inequality can be constructed. Insurance 
  premiums computed in these cases simply represent a measure of what society 
  would willingly pay to eliminate inequality. Such an approach assumes the possibility 
  of defining an international social welfare function. Let us now look at the 
  difficulties involved in defining it.</p>
