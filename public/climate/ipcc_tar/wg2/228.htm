<h3>5.4.4. Adaptation by Humans for Changes in Goods and Services </h3>
<p>The ability of wildlife to adapt naturally to climate change is largely a function 
  of available genetic diversity and the rate of change. This section deals not 
  with natural adaptation but with human adaptation to changes in wildlife populations, 
  in terms of conserving wildlife and replacing some of the goods and services 
  that wildlife provides.</p>
<h4><a name="5441"></a>5.4.4.1. Parks and Reserves</h4>
<p>One typical method to adapt to declines in wildlife populations has been establishment 
  of refuges, parks, and reserves. Placement of reserves, however, rarely has 
  taken into account potential rapid climate change, even though the problems 
  of such change and reserve placement were discussed in the mid-1980s (Peters 
  and Darling, 1985). Managers of current reserves and parks need to be encouraged 
  to consider rapid climate change in developing future management plans (Solomon, 
  1994; Halpin, 1997). Developing a series of bioindicators to monitor the potential 
  impacts of rapid climate change on parks and reserves may be possible (de Groot 
  and Ketner, 1994).</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology has estimated that 
  10% of all designated areas (i.e., nature reserves) could be lost (e.g., to 
  habitat degradation) within 30-40 years and that species distribution in 
  50% of designated areas could change significantly over the same period (UK 
  DETR, 1999). In light of these changes, there is a need for a robust nature 
  conservation system that can accommodate climate change.</p>
<p>In part, the disparity between siting reserves where wildlife species currently 
  are versus where they may be in the future may stem from uncertainties in the 
  rate and amount of projected climate change. If a species' range shifts 
  out of a reserve created for its survival, the current reserve placement could 
  even be considered maladaptive. However, if reserves are not created and species 
  are lost to other pressures, the potential effects of climate change on species 
  distributions are moot (see <a href="#box57">Box 5-7</a>).</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 5-7. Biodiversity Hotspots and Climate Change 
        </b> </div>
      <p>Biodiversity hotspots are areas with exceptional concentrations of endemic 
        species facing extraordinary threats of habitat destruction. Twenty-five 
        hotspots contain the sole remaining habitats for 133,149 (44%) vascular 
        land plants and 9,732 (36%) terrestrial vertebrates (Myers et al., 2000). 
        The number of invertebrates is not known, but in light of the many interactions 
        (e.g., pollination) between plants and invertebrates, especially insects, 
        the concentrations of these animals probably parallel those of plants. 
        Nine of these hot spots occur on islands, making them particularly vulnerable 
        to sea-level rise and limiting or preventing the opportunity for many 
        terrestrial animals to modify their range (Myers et al., 2000). Because 
        these 25 hotspots constitute only 1.4% of the Earth's land surface 
        (Myers et al., 2000), they provide an opportunity for planners to respond 
        to the biodiversity crisis by giving priority status to conserving them. 
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, synergistic effects of climate change and requirements 
        to conserve areas for species survival may complicate the situation. With 
        warming temperatures, many species are expected to move poleward (Parmesan 
        et al., 1999) or upward in altitude (Pounds et al., 1999). This implies 
        that the locations of hotspot reserves may need to allow for such movement, 
        which may require a somewhat larger region to be conserved. Even with 
        these efforts, some species may not be conserved because they presently 
        are as far poleward (e.g., fynbos region at the southern tip of South 
        Africa) or as high in altitude (e.g., cloud forests in Costa Rica) as 
        they can be.</p>
