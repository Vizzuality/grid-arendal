<h3>5.2.3. Impacts on Biodiversity </h3>
<p>Biodiversity is assessed quantitatively at different levels&#151;notably at 
  the genetic level (i.e., the richness of genetically different types within 
  the total population), the species level (i.e., the richness of species in an 
  area), and the landscape level (i.e., the richness of ecosystem types within 
  a given area). Overall, biodiversity is forecast to decrease in the future as 
  a result of a multitude of pressures, particularly increased land-use intensity 
  and associated destruction of natural or semi-natural habitats (Heywood and 
  Watson, 1996). The most significant processes are habitat loss and fragmentation 
  (or reconnection, in the case of freshwater bodies); introduction of exotic 
  species (invasives); and direct effects on reproduction, dominance, and survival 
  through chemical and mechanical treatments. In a few cases, there might be an 
  increase in local biodiversity, but this usually is a result of species introductions, 
  and the longer term consequences of these changes are hard to foresee. <br>
</p>
<p>These pressures on biodiversity are occurring independent of climate change, 
  so the critical question is: How much might climate change enhance or inhibit 
  these losses in biodiversity? There is little evidence to suggest that processes 
  associated with climate change will slow species losses. Palaeoecology data 
  suggest that the global biota should produce an average of three new species 
  per year, with large variation about that mean between geological eras (Sepkoski, 
  1998). Pulses of speciation sometimes appear to be associated with climate change, 
  although moderate oscillations of climate do not necessarily promote speciation 
  despite forcing changes in species' geographical ranges. <br>
</p>
<p>Dukes and Mooney (1999) conclude that increases in nitrogen deposition and 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration favor groups of species that share 
  certain physiological or life history traits that are common among invasive 
  species, allowing them to capitalize on global change. Vitousek <i>et al</i>. (1997b) 
  are confident that the doubling of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen 
  cycle as a result of human activities is leading to accelerated losses of biological 
  diversity among plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen and animals and 
  microorganisms that depend on them. In a risk assessment of Switzerland alpine 
  flora, Kienast <i>et al</i>. (1998) conclude that species diversity could increase 
  or at least remain unchanged, depending on the precise climate change scenario 
  used.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5231"></a>5.2.3.1. Global Models of Biodiversity Change </h4>
<p>Several general principles describe global biodiversity patterns in relation 
  to climate, evolutionary history, isolation, and so forth. These principles 
  continue to be the subject of considerable ecological theory and testing; the 
  Global Biodiversity Assessment (Heywood and Watson, 1996) and the Encyclopaedia 
  of Biodiversity (Levin, 2000) contain detailed reviews. <br>
</p>
<p>Kleidon and Mooney (2000) have developed a process-based model that simulates 
  the response of randomly chosen parameter combinations ("species") 
  to climate processes. They demonstrate that the model mimics the current distribution 
  of biodiversity under current climate and that modeled "species" can 
  be grouped into categories that closely match currently recognized biomes. Sala 
  <i>et al</i>. (2000) used expert assessment and a qualitative model to assess biodiversity 
  scenarios for 2100. They conclude that Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems 
  are likely to experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because 
  of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern 
  temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change 
  because major land-use change already has occurred. <br>
</p>
<p>Modeling to date demonstrates that the global distribution of biodiversity 
  is fundamentally constrained by climate (see <a href="204.htm#box52">Box 5-2</a>). 
  Future development along these lines (e.g., adding competitive relations and 
  migration processes) could provide useful insights into the effect of climate 
  change on biodiversity and the effects of biodiversity on fluxes of carbon and 
  water on a global scale.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="524"></a>5.2.4. Challenges </h3>
<p>There has been considerable progress since the SAR on our understanding of 
  effects of global change on the biosphere. Observational and experimental studies 
  of the effects of climate change on biological and physical processes have increased 
  significantly, providing greater insights into the nature of the relationships. 
  Greater biological realism has been incorporated into models of small patches 
  of vegetation (point models), and more realistic biological representations 
  have been incorporated into regional and global change models. The main improvement 
  has been development of dynamic representations of biological processes that 
  respond directly to climate. Nevertheless, several major challenges remain before 
  fully effective models of the interaction between climate and biophysical processes 
  will be available.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5241"></a>5.2.4.1. Landscape Processes </h4>
<p>Most vegetation models still treat patches of vegetation as a matrix of discrete 
  units, with little interaction between each unit. However, modeling studies 
  (Noble and Gitay, 1996; Rupp <i>et al</i>., 2000) have shown that significant errors 
  in predicting vegetation changes can occur if spatial interactions of landscape 
  elements are treated inadequately. For example, the spread of fires is partly 
  determined by the paths of previous fires and subsequent vegetation regrowth. 
  Thus, the fire regime and vegetation dynamics generated by a point model and 
  a landscape model with the same ignition frequencies can be very different. 
  There has been considerable progress in modeling of spatial patterns of disturbances 
  within landscapes (Bradstock <i>et al</i>., 1998; He and Mladenoff, 1999; Keane <i>et al</i>., 1999), but it is not possible to simulate global or regional vegetation 
  change at the landscape scale. Thus, the challenge is to find rules for incorporating 
  landscape phenomena into models with much coarser resolution.<br>
</p>
<p>Another challenge is to develop realistic models of plant migration. On the 
  basis of paleoecological, modeling, and observational data, Pitelka and Plant 
  Migration Workshop Group (1997) conclude that dispersal would not be a significant 
  problem for most species in adapting to climate change, provided that the matrix 
  of suitable habitats was not too fragmented. However, in habitats fragmented 
  by human activities that are common over much of the Earth's land surface, 
  opportunities for migration will be limited and restricted to only a portion 
  of the species pool (Bj&ouml;rkman, 1999).</p>
