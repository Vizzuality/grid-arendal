<h2>5.1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
<p>Ecosystems provide many products and services that are crucial to human survival 
  (Daily, 1997; UNEP, 1998; WRI, 2000). Ecosystems affect biogeochemical and physical 
  feedbacks to the biosphere and atmosphere, hence are important for the functioning 
  of the Earth's systems. Ecosystems form a landscape and are connected in 
  many ways, often by streams, rivers, and wildlife. Thus, landscape fragmentation, 
  along with other human activities, affects ecosystems' ability to meet 
  human needs and will continue to do so for the future, possibly at a faster 
  rate (UNEP, 1998). Changes in global climate and atmospheric composition are 
  likely to have an impact on most of these goods and services, with significant 
  impacts on socioeconomic systems (Winnett, 1998).</p>
<p>This chapter assesses the impacts of climate change on ecosystem goods and 
  services from sectors such as agriculture, forests, and wetlands. Inland aquatic 
  systems are covered from an ecosystem perspective in this chapter; hydrology 
  and water as a physical resource are covered in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>. 
  Marine and coastal systems are considered in <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>. 
  When ecosystems are highly managed, as in agriculture and forestry, or their 
  goods and services are traded in markets, the social and economic consequences 
  of climate change that naturally arise are assessed explicitly.</p>
<p>Biomass production, biogeochemical cycling, soil and water relationships, and 
  animal-plant interactions (including biodiversity) are considered to be some 
  of the major functions of ecosystems. Within these functions, various products 
  (goods) and services can be identified, including food, fiber, fuel and energy, 
  fodder, medicines, clean water, clean air, flood/ storm control, pollination, 
  seed dispersal, pest and disease control, soil regeneration, biodiversity, and 
  recreation/amenity (UNEP, 1998; WRI, 2000). Society places values on these goods 
  and services, directly or indirectly (<a href="202.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>). 
  Ecosystems provide many of these goods and services simultaneously. For example, 
  agricultural systems provide much of our food, fiber, and fuel needs and at 
  the same time influence biogeochemical cycling, soil and water quality, and 
  biodiversity. Many services from ecosystems lie outside market systems, making 
  it difficult to price them (Bawa and Gadgil, 1997; Goulder and Kennedy, 1997; 
  National Research Council, 1999). However, these nonmarket values are likely 
  to be larger (as much as 1,000-fold; WRI, 2000) than the value of services provided 
  by markets in total and at many specific sites (Costanza <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  Although several studies estimating different values for nonmarket services 
  from ecosystems exist (see <a href="202.htm#tab52">Table 5-2</a>), they can 
  be applied only with low to medium confidence (Goulder and Kennedy, 1997). Valuation 
  of ecosystem services is complex because many goods and services occur simultaneously. 
  Thus, it is not sufficient to consider, for example, the timber value of the 
  forest; we also must consider the soil/water protection that the trees provide, 
  the habitat for pollinators, or the bequest value of the forest (WRI, 2000). 
</p>
<p>The Earth is being subjected to many human-induced and natural changes, often 
  referred to as global change. These changes include pressures from increased 
  demand for resources driven by economic growth, increased human population, 
  land-use and land-cover change, the accelerated rate of anthropogenic nitrogen 
  production and other air pollutants, and urbanization and industrialization; 
  resulting fossil fuel emissions contribute to a discernible impact on global 
  climate (Naiman <i>et al</i>., 1995a; Vitousek <i>et al</i>., 1997a; IPCC, 1998; 
  UNEP, 1998; Walker <i>et al</i>., 1999). For ecosystems, the impacts of climate 
  change include changes in atmospheric composition and disturbance regimes, such 
  as frequencies of fires, storms, floods, and drought. The impacts of other pressures 
  often lead to increased demand for access to land, water, and wildlife resources. 
  The result is a change in the state of the Earth's land surface, the services 
  humans receive, and the landscapes where humans live at regional and global 
  scales. Governance and equity issues are important (UNEP, 1998) in overcoming 
  some of these; these are covered in detail in <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> 
  <a href="../wg3/048.htm">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding the current status of ecosystems, pressures on them, and their 
  responses is important for assessing the impact of the additional pressure of 
  climate change. The State-Pressure-Response model of the Organisation for Economic 
  Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been used as a framework in structuring 
  many subsequent sections of this chapter (see <a href="202.htm#tab51">Figure 
  5-1</a>). Using this model, the "state" refers to assessments of current status 
  and recent trends of each sector and "pressures" include direct and indirect 
  human pressures. The concept of "response" has been modified to include automatic 
  responses of ecosystems (referred to as automatic adaptation in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>) to the impacts of climate change (including that of natural climatic 
  variability). Deliberate "adaptation" options to climate change to overcome 
  some of these impacts-responses could alleviate some of the pressures. Systems 
  that are not able to adapt are likely to become vulnerable (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>); thus, vulnerability also is assessed.</p>
<p>In many sections, four goods and services have been emphasized because of the 
  availability of literature and space constraints: food, fiber, carbon storage, 
  and biodiversity. Many other topics&#151;for example, related to water cycling 
  and hydrology&#151;could have been considered. Some of these are covered in 
  other chapters of this report (e.g., <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a> and as 
  key regional concerns in Chapters <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). 
</p>
<p>Some impacts of global change apply across many sectors and are considered 
  in <a href="202.htm">Section 5.2</a>. Many of the impacts of climate change 
  are projected by using models, and <a href="202.htm">Section 5.2</a> includes 
  a critique of several of these models. Some studies in the literature already 
  have identified regional impacts of post-industrial climate change on some ecosystems. 
  These are discussed in the most appropriate sections under "impacts-response" 
  but are dealt with mainly in Sections <a href="202.htm">5.2</a> and <a href="218.htm">5.4</a>.</p>
