<h4>8.3.4.1. Adaptation Mechanisms: Risk-Spreading</h4>
<p>Public and private insurance is inherently a risk-spreading mechanism. Insurers 
  also can spread risks through reinsurance, depending on its availability and 
  price. Losses associated with uninsurable risks, or unpaid claims in the event 
  of insurer insolvencies, often are partly spread to the community through disaster 
  relief or guaranty ("solvency") funds. State-managed guaranty funds&#151;to 
  which insurers must contribute&#151;are used for specified catastrophe losses 
  in France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, the UK, and the United States (III, 
  2000a; Swiss Re, 2000a). Of the 25 largest U.S. P/C insolvencies (amounting 
  to US$5 billion in claims), 29% of the losses were recoverable through guaranty 
  funds; national capacity was only US$3.4 billion as of 1998 (NCIGF, 1999). In 
  the United States, the property insurance residual markets known as Fair Access 
  to Insurance Requirements (FAIR Plans), Beach or Windstorm Plans, and joint 
  underwriting associations (JUAs) represented insured property value (exposure) 
  of US$24 billion in 1970 and US$285 billion in 1998 (III, 1999; Gastel, 2000).</p>
<p>Although risks also can be spread between public and private insurers, governments 
  have elected to cap their exposures by formally limiting government-paid losses 
  for weather-related events in the United States (GAO, 1994; Pullen, 1999b; III, 
  2000b) and earthquake losses in Japan (Gastel, 1999). Governments also are trying 
  to reduce their insurance and disaster recovery spending (ISO, 1994b, 1999; 
  FEMA, 2000).</p>
<p>Nonconventional "alternative risk transfer" (ART) mechanisms have begun to 
  emerge and are regarded by some banks and insurers as playing a role in the 
  continued viability of insurance (see <a href="337.htm">Section 8.4</a>). On 
  the other hand, some insurers, consumers, and members of the financial community 
  question the efficacy and attractiveness of these new risk-spreading mechanisms 
  (Tol, 1998; Peara, 1999; Swiss Re, 1999b; Bantwal and Kunreuther, 2000; Freeman, 
  2000; GAO, 2000a; Jamison, 2000; Nutter, 2000).</p>
<p>"Moral hazard"&#151;a pervasive issue in the industry&#151;results 
  when, by virtue of adaptation efforts or the very availability of insurance 
  (or reinsurance or government aid), the insured feels less compelled to prevent 
  losses (White and Etkin, 1997; Ryland, 2000). Government programs have been 
  faulted for unintentionally encouraging such maladaptation and risky behavior 
  (Anderson, 2000; Changnon and Easterling, 2000). For example, it is estimated 
  that one-quarter of the development over the past 20 years in at-risk areas 
  along the U.S. coastline is a result of the presence of the National Flood Insurance 
  Program (Heinz Center, 2000). Moral hazard also has been ascribed to primary 
  insurers or reinsurers who rely excessively on state-maintained guaranty funds 
  (Kunreuther and Roth, 1998; Swiss Re, 2000a).</p>
