<h3>5.3.5. Modeling Impacts and Adaptation in a Global Economy </h3>
<p>Relatively few studies cited in the SAR linked estimates of yield responses 
  to climate change with regional or global economic models to estimate production 
  and welfare impacts. New studies that make such links provide important information 
  on climate change-induced impacts on agriculture and on global and regional 
  well-being (summaries are in Darwin <i>et al</i>., 1995; Adams <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Lewandrowski and Schimmelpfennig, 1999). Recent contributions incorporate 
  more crops and livestock, utilize Geographic Information System (GIS)-based 
  land-use data, and link structural and spatial analogs (<a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 
  5-4a</a>). As noted in <a href="209.htm">Section 5.3.2</a>, the price of agricultural 
  commodities is a useful statistic to summarize the net impacts of climate change 
  on the regional or global supply/demand balance and on food security. <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 
  5-4a</a> shows that the global model used by Darwin <i>et al</i>. (1995) and 
  the U.S. model developed by Adams <i>et al</i>. (1998) predict that, with the 
  rate of average warming expected by IPCC scenarios over the next century, agricultural 
  production and prices are likely to continue to follow the downward path observed 
  in the 20th century (see <a href="209.htm">Section 5.3.2</a>). As a result, 
  impacts on aggregate welfare are a small percentage of GDP and tend to be positive, 
  especially when the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization are incorporated. 
  The only study that predicts real price increases with only modest amounts of 
  climate change is Parry <i>et al</i>. (1999). <br>
</p>
<p> An important limitation of studies summarized in Reilly <i>et al</i>. (1996) 
  is their focus on high-income regions of the world. Antle (1996b), Reilly <i>et 
  al</i>. (1996), and Smith <i>et al</i>. (1996a) have suggested that impacts 
  of climate change may be larger and more adverse in poorer parts of the world, 
  where farmers and consumers are less able to adapt. The first study to address 
  this question quantitatively in an aggregate regional analysis is Winters <i>et 
  al</i>. (1999; they studied the impacts of climate change on Africa, Asia, and 
  Latin America by using a computable general equilibrium model. Their analysis 
  used larger price increases than those predicted by more recent studies in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 
  5-4a</a>, so this analysis should show more adverse impacts than an analysis 
  based on prices from the more recent global studies. The results summarized 
  in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4a</a> focus on the most vulnerable groups 
  in poor countries&#151;poor farmers and urban poor consumers. The results show 
  that impacts on the incomes of these vulnerable groups would tend to be negative 
  and in the range of 0 to -10%; in contrast, the impacts on consumer and producer 
  groups predicted for the United States by Adams <i>et al</i>. (1998) ranged 
  from -0.1 to +1%. Darwin (1999) reports results disaggregated by region and 
  concludes that developing regions are likely to have welfare effects that are 
  less positive or more negative than more-developed regions. <br>

<h3><a name="536"></a>5.3.6. Vulnerability of the Agricultural Sector</h3>
<p>A population, region, or sector is vulnerable to climate change when serious 
  deficits or unused opportunities remain after taking account of adaptation. 
  Assessment of agricultural vulnerability to climate change calls attention to 
  populations, regions, and sectors that may lose the means to satisfy basic needs 
  (food security, progress toward development, a healthy environment) or fail 
  to seize opportunities to improve social welfare. Particularly when such cases 
  result in part from market failure, issues of consequential equity arise that 
  signal policy interventions. Although no single measure of agricultural vulnerability 
  exists, several indices together provide a sketch of vulnerability, including 
  crop yields, crop prices, production, income, number of people at risk of hunger, 
  rates of erosion, and irrigation demand.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5361"></a>5.3.6.1. How Much Warming can Global Agriculture Absorb 
  Before Prices Rise? </h4>
<p>Is there an amount of climate change to which the global food production system 
  can adapt with little harm but beyond which it is likely to impose serious hardship? 
  An answer can be sketched only with very low confidence at this time because 
  of the combination of uncertainties noted above. As noted in <a href="209.htm">Section 
  5.3.2</a>, prices are the best indicator of the balance between global food 
  supply and demand. They determine the access of a majority of the world's population 
  to an adequate diet. Two of three global studies reviewed here project that 
  real agricultural output prices will decline with a mean global temperature 
  increase of as much as 2.5&ordm;C, especially if accompanied by modest increase 
  in precipitation (Darwin <i>et al</i>., 1995; Adams <i>et al</i>., 1998). Another 
  study (Parry <i>et al</i>., 1999) projects that output prices will rise with 
  or without climate change, and even a global mean temperature increase of ~1&ordm;C 
  (projected by 2020) causes prices to rise relative to the case with no climate 
  change. When studies from the SAR are included with these more recent ones, 
  there is general agreement that a mean global temperature rise of more than 
  2.5&ordm;C could increase prices (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 1996; Adams <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Parry <i>et al</i>., 1999), with one exception (Darwin <i>et al</i>., 
  1995). Thus, with very low confidence, it is concluded from these studies that 
  a global temperature rise of greater than 2.5&ordm; C is likely to exceed the 
  capacity of the global food production system to adapt without price increases. 
  However, results are too mixed to support a defensible conclusion regarding 
  the vulnerability of the global balance of agricultural supply and demand to 
  smaller amounts of warming than 2.5&ordm;C.</p>
