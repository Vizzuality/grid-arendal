<h2>8.7. Future Challenges and Research Needs</h2>
<p>This assessment reviews our improved knowledge since the SAR. However, it also 
  identifies many areas in which greater understanding is still needed and suggests 
  several challenges for the research community. These challenges can be summarized 
  as follows.</p>
<p><i>Improve the transfer of knowledge from the scientific community studying 
  climate change and weather forecasting to the financial services community.</i> 
  There clearly is a need for better understanding of how extreme weather events 
  that are important to financial service firms could be affected by climate change. 
  New knowledge should be communicated to the financial community and society 
  for practical use. There is a specific need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop ways for the insurance sector to blend information from the scientific 
    community's climate models, as they evolve, with its own loss estimation 
    models<br>
  </li>
  <li> Improve daily, seasonal, and annual forecasting of extreme weather, and 
    adapt it for use in disaster prevention.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Advance the understanding of the relative global and regional vulnerability 
  and adaptability of insurance and other financial services to climate change.</i> 
  The trend in losses from extreme weather events has raised questions about the 
  insurance sector's vulnerability to climate change in some respects, although 
  as a whole the industry could be quite resilient. Even less is known about the 
  relative vulnerability or resiliency of other segments of the financial services 
  sector. A more definitive assessment of the industry's strengths and weaknesses 
  in the face of climate change is necessary, with specific needs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Continue analysis to disaggregate climate change, socioeconomic, and any 
    other non-climate drivers of observed trends in historic economic (insured 
    and uninsured) losses<br>
  </li>
  <li> Explore specific aspects of the industry's vulnerability and resiliency, 
    including maximum probable insurance losses; insurer surplus available for 
    paying claims; insolvency risk in local insurance markets; and ability to 
    raise rates, reduce coverage, or otherwise decrease losses by shifting risk 
    to others<br>
  </li>
  <li> Assess how climate change could affect the actual and perceived risk of 
    existing loan and investment portfolios<br>
  </li>
  <li> Understand if or how investors are changing their perceptions of investment 
    risk in light of potential climate change and explore actions that investors 
    are taking in light of any changes in the perception of risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Explore the role of the financial services sector in dealing with risks 
  to society from climate change.</i> As intermediaries and risk experts, the 
  financial services sector could play a positive role in efforts to deal with 
  the risks of climate change. The sector also could play an important role in 
  identifying potential synergies and conflicts regarding funding for adaptation 
  and mitigation measures. Work is needed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess and develop financial instruments that can spread and hedge against 
    the risks of climate change for developing and developed countries<br>
  </li>
  <li> Quantify the need for financial resources for investment in adaptation<br>
  </li>
  <li> Determine how the availability of funds for adaptation could be affected 
    by the use of funds for mitigation activities and vice versa<br>
  </li>
  <li> Identify any synergies between options for adaptation and for mitigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Explore the range of possible financing arrangements to cover the cost of 
  adapting to climate change:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li> Investigate potential financial resources needed over the next few decades 
    to cover the cost of damage from climate change and adaptation to climate 
    change<br>
  </li>
  <li> Evaluate alternative methods of covering such costs<br>
  </li>
  <li> Develop innovative finance schemes for issues of risk and security regarding 
    long-term investments<br>
  </li>
  <li> Investigate the potential role of and effects on private and public financial 
    services providers.</li>
</ul>
