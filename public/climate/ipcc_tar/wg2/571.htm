<h4><a name="152422"></a>15.2.4.2.2. Rodent-borne diseases</h4>
<h6><a name="1524221"></a>15.2.4.2.2.1. Hantavirus </h6>
<p>In 1993, Sin Nombre virus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), 
  emerged in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. Unusually 
  prolonged rainfall associated with the 1991-1992 El Ni&ntilde;o was implicated 
  as a causal factor in the outbreak (Engelthaler <i>et al</i>., 1999; Glass <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000). As of 1999, 231 cases had been confirmed in the United States, 
  with a mortality rate of 42% (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). A total of 16 cases 
  of HPS have been identified in Canada. These cases occurred in British Columbia, 
  Alberta, and Saskatchewan (Stephen <i>et al</i>., 1994; Werker <i>et al</i>., 
  1995; Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>HPS could undergo changes in occurrence related to increased contacts between 
  rodents and people. Because the virus is present in rodents in the United States 
  and Canada and changes in climate and ecology are known to affect rodent behavior, 
  it is assumed that changes in the incidence of HPS would result with global 
  warming (Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998), but they will be difficult to predict 
  because of local rainfall variability.<br>
</p>
<p>Adaptive measures to reduce the risks of contracting vector- and rodent-borne 
  diseases include providing information, vaccination, and drug prophylaxis for 
  travellers, as well as use of repellants, surveillance, and monitoring (Patz 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). <br>
</p>
<h6><a name="1524222"></a>15.2.4.2.2.2. Diseases associated with water </h6>
<p>More than 200 million people in the United States have direct access to treated 
  public water supply systems. Nevertheless, 9 million cases of water-borne diseases 
  are estimated to occur each year (Bennett <i>et al</i>., 1987). Although most 
  of the water-borne disease involves mild gastrointestinal illness, some disease 
  causes severe outcomes, such as myocarditis (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Giardia occurs in American and Canadian watersheds, resulting in widespread 
  human exposure (Schantz, 1991; Chow, 1993; Moore <i>et al</i>., 1993; Wallis 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Olson <i>et al</i>., 1997; Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  A study of 1,760 water samples from 72 municipalities across Canada showed that 
  giardia cysts were found in 73% of the raw sewage samples, 21% of the raw water 
  samples, and 18.2% of the treated water samples (Wallis <i>et al</i>., 1996). 
  Cryptosporidium&#151;considered to be one of the most common enteric pathogens 
  worldwide (Meinhardt <i>et al</i>., 1996)&#151;is less common in Canada than 
  giardia cysts, however. Cryptosporidium was found in only 6.1% of raw sewage 
  samples, 4.5% of raw water samples, and 3.5% of treated water samples (Wallis 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>Increases in ambient temperatures, a prolonged summer season, increased heavy 
  rainfall and/or runoff events, and many watersheds with mixes of intensive agriculture 
  and urbanization led to recent large outbreaks of cryptosporidium in the United 
  States (MacKenzie <i>et al</i>., 1994; Goldstein <i>et al</i>., 1996; Osewe 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996) and the UK (Bridgeman <i>et al</i>., 1995) and may be indicative 
  of the future. In 1993, more than 400,000 cases (including 54 deaths) resulted 
  from a cryptosporidium outbreak in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, water supply (MacKenzie 
  <i>et al</i>., 1994). A positive correlation between rainfall, cyrptosporidium 
  oocyst and giardia cyst concentrations in river water, and human disease outbreaks 
  has been noted (Weniger <i>et al</i>., 1983). <br>
</p>
<p>The largest ever reported outbreak of toxoplasmosis was traced to the municipal 
  water supply of the greater Victoria area of British Columbia (British Columbia 
  Toxoplasmosis Team, 1995; Den Hollander and Noteboom, 1996; Mullens, 1996; Bowie 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). There already is evidence 
  that exposure to the causative parasite in Canada is widespread (Tizard <i>et 
  al</i>., 1977, 1978). Given the increasing number of feral cats in Canada and 
  the persistence of sporulated oocysts in a variety of environments (Dubey and 
  Beattie, 1988), areas in Canada that are hospitable to oocyst survival are likely 
  to expand as a result of climate change.<br>
</p>
<p>Warm marine water may favor growth of toxic organisms such as red tides, which 
  cause three varieties of shellfish poisoning: paralytic, diarrheic, and amnesic. 
  Domoic acid&#151;a toxin produced by the Nitzchia pungens diatom that causes 
  amnesic shellfish poisoning&#151;appeared on Prince Edward Island for the first 
  time in 1987. A total of 107 patients were identified, of whom 19 were hospitalized. 
  Of those requiring hospitalization, 12 people required intensive care because 
  of coma, profuse respiratory secretions, or unstable blood pressure. A total 
  of four people died as a result of eating contaminated mussels (Perl <i>et al</i>., 
  1990). The outbreak coincided with an El Ni&ntilde;o year, when warm eddies 
  of the Gulf Stream neared the shore and heavy rains increased nutrient-rich 
  runoff (Glavin <i>et al</i>., 1990; Perl <i>et al</i>., 1990; Teitelbaum <i>et 
  al</i>., 1990; Hatfield <i>et al</i>., 1994; Shriner and Street, 1998). In the 
  United States, marine-related illness increased during El Ni&ntilde;o events 
  over the past 25 years. During the strong El Ni&ntilde;o event of 1997-1998, 
  precipitation and runoff greatly increased counts of fecal bacteria and viruses 
  in local coastal waters in Florida (Harvell <i>et al</i>., 1999). Contamination 
  of water bodies by animal and human wastes can stimulate harmful algae such 
  as Pfiesteria that have been demonstrated to cause illness in humans and death 
  in some species of fish (Burkholder <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Potential adaptive measures to reduce water-borne disease include improved 
  water safety criteria, monitoring, treatment of surface water, and sewage/sanitation 
  systems (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). Land-use management should include consideration 
  of water supply and quality.</p>
