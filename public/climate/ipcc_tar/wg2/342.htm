<h3>8.5.3. Natural Disasters and Development</h3>
<p>Disasters may have a significant impact on the national economy of the country 
  concerned. Some countries lose annually up to 1% or more of their annual GDP 
  as a consequence of recurring natural disaster; in individual cases, damages 
  have been as high as 50% of GDP. The typical Chinese loss experience in bad 
  years is in the range of 5-7% of annual GDP. In 1974, losses in Honduras 
  from Hurricane Fifi were equivalent to 50% of the country's 1973 GDP (Hooke, 
  2000). Setbacks in development may have been up to 1 decade or more. The majority 
  of these damages usually are covered by the affected population itself or from 
  other domestic sources (United Nations, 1994). In some cases, the relation between 
  GDP and disasters is ambiguous because post-disaster investments may increase 
  GDP. Long-term problems arise when the return period of a disaster is the same 
  order of magnitude or smaller than the time needed for reconstruction. In such 
  cases, the economy of a country or a specific region is likely to spiral downward 
  (Downing <i>et al</i>., 1999). In fact, GDP is a very limited way of describing 
  the impact of weather-related disasters. For example, the UN has defined a disaster 
  as large when the ability of the region to cope with the effects of the disaster 
  on its own is exceeded.</p>
<p>Urban and rural infrastructure loss in the developing world as a result of 
  natural disasters has impacted the activity of the world's international 
  lending institutions. The World Bank has estimated that it has loaned US$14 
  billion to developing countries in the past 20 years for damages from natural 
  disasters. This amount is nearly 2.5 times the amount loaned by the Bank for 
  relief from civil disturbance worldwide (Kreimer <i>et al</i>., 1998). The Asian 
  Development Bank (ADB) has estimated that between 1988 and 1998, 5.6% of ADB 
  loans were for disaster rehabilitation. In 1992, nearly 20% of ADB loans were 
  for rehabilitative assistance to natural disaster recovery (Arriens and Benson, 
  1999). The World Bank has estimated that during the past decade in Mexico, as 
  much as 35% of its lending earmarked for infrastructure has been diverted to 
  pay for the costs of (Mexican) natural catastrophes (Freeman, 1999). In recent 
  years, the World Bank has recognized the importance of disaster prevention and 
  mitigation for development and poverty reduction (Kreimer and Arnold, 2000).</p>
