<h3>13.2.3. Agriculture and Fisheries </h3>
<h4><a name="13231"></a>13.2.3.1. Agriculture </h4>
<p>Agriculture accounts for only a small part of GDP in Europe. Therefore, the 
  vulnerability of the overall economy to changes that affect agriculture is low 
  (Reilly, 1996). Locally, however, effects on society may be large. Europe as 
  a whole is noted for its substantial output of arable crops and animal products 
  (FAOSTAT, 1998). </p>
<p>Trends in European agriculture are dominated by the EU's Common Agricultural 
  Policy (CAP). This occurs because EU member states account for a large proportion 
  of agricultural production in Europe and because several countries currently 
  are seeking membership in the EU and in this process are adjusting their policy 
  to match the CAP. The EU seeks to integrate concerns for environmental protection 
  and countryside livelihood into the CAP. </p>
<p>Many studies have assessed the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity 
  (e.g., Ryszkowski and Kedziora, 1993; Harrison et al., 1995b; Semenov and Porter, 
  1995; Alexandrov, 1999; Cuculeanu et al., 1999; Harrison et al., 1999). Relatively 
  little work, however, has been done to link these results across sectors to 
  identify vulnerable regions and farming systems. Such assessments are needed 
  to identify appropriate policy responses to climate change. More extensive information 
  than the summary presented in this section appears in the agriculture chapter 
  of the European ACACIA report (Bindi and Olesen, 2000). </p>

<p><a name="fig136"></a>Cereals of different species and varieties are grown throughout 
  Europe. Climatic warming will expand the area of cereals cultivation (e.g., 
  wheat and maize) northward (Kenny et al., 1993; Harrison and Butterfield, 1996; 
  Carter et al., 1996a). For wheat, a temperature rise will lead to a small yield 
  reduction, whereas an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> will cause a large yield increase; 
  the net effect of both for a moderate climate change is a large yield increase 
  (Nonhebel, 1996; Harrison and Butterfield, 1999). Drier conditions and increasing 
  temperatures in the Mediterranean region and parts of eastern Europe may lead 
  to lower yields and the need for new varieties and cultivation methods. Yield 
  reductions have been estimated for eastern Europe, and yield variability may 
  increase, especially in the steppe regions (Alexandrov, 1997; Sirotenko et al., 
  1997). <a href="#fig136">Figure 13-6a</a> shows the response of wheat yields 
  to change of climate and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for a GCM scenario for 
  2050 that resembles the A1 scenario. The largest increases in yield occur in 
  southern Europe-particularly northern Spain, southern France, Italy, and Greece. 
  Relatively large yield increases (3-4 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) also occur in Fenno-Scandinavia. 
  In the rest of Europe, yields are 1-3 t ha<sup>-1</sup> greater than at present. 
  There are small areas where yields are predicted to decrease by as much as 3 
  t ha-1, such as in southern Portugal, southern Spain, and Ukraine. For maize, 
  future climate scenario analyses carried out for selected sites in Europe suggest 
  mainly increases in yield for northern areas and decreases in southern areas 
  (Wolf and van Diepen, 1995). This is a result of a small effect of increased 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration on growth (maize is a C<sub>4</sub> plant that 
  responds less positively to CO<sub>2</sub> increases than C<sub>3</sub> plants 
  such as wheat and barley) and a negative effect of temperature on the duration 
  of growing season. The latter effect, however, can be largely prevented by growing 
  other maize varieties (Wolf and van Diepen, 1995). </p>
<p>Seed crops generally are determinate species, and the duration to maturity 
  depends on temperature and day length. A temperature increase therefore will 
  shorten the length of the growing period and possibly reduce yields (Peiris 
  et al., 1996). At the same time, the cropping areas of cooler season seed crops 
  (e.g., pea, faba bean, and oilseed rape) probably will expand northward into 
  Fenno-Scandinavia, leading to increased productivity of seed crops there. There 
  also will be northward expansion of warmer season seed crops (e.g., soybean 
  and sunflower). Harrison and Butterfield (1996) estimate this northward expansion 
  for sunflower; they also found a general decrease in water-limited yield of 
  sunflower in many regions, particularly in western Europe. Analysis of the effect 
  of climatic change on soybean yield for selected sites in western Europe suggests 
  mainly increases in yield (Wolf, 2000a). This is a result of a positive effect 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration on growth and only a small effect of temperature 
  on crop duration. </p>
<p>Vegetables cover a wide range of species with a large variation in type of 
  yield components, including leaves, stalks, inflorescence, bulbs, roots, and 
  tubers. Most vegetables are high-value crops that are grown under ample water 
  and nutrient supply. Their response to changes in temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  varies among species, mainly depending on the type of yield component and the 
  response of phenological development to temperature change. For determinate 
  crops such as onions, warming will reduce the duration of crop growth and hence 
  yield (Harrison et al., 1995b), whereas warming stimulates growth and yield 
  in indeterminate crops such as carrots (Wheeler et al., 1996). Onion yields 
  are sensitive to the degree of warming (Harrison et al., 1995b), with a yield 
  decrease for warmer scenarios and a yield increase for cooler scenarios. There 
  also is a spatial gradient, with yield increases in northwest Europe to decreases 
  in southeast Europe. For lettuce, temperature has been found to have little 
  influence on yield, whereas yield is stimulated by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (Pearson et al., 1997). For cool-season vegetable crops such as cauliflower, 
  large temperature increases may decrease production during the summer period 
  in southern Europe because of decreased yield quality (Olesen and Grevsen, 1993). 
  Root and tuber crops are expected to show a large response to rising atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> because of their large underground sinks for carbon and apoplastic 
  mechanisms of phloem loading (Farrar, 1996; Komor et al., 1996). On the other 
  hand, warming may reduce the growing season and enhance water requirements, 
  with consequences for yield. Climate change scenario studies performed with 
  crop models show increases in potato yields in northern Europe and decreases 
  or no change in the rest of Europe (Wolf, 2000b). Simulation results show an 
  increase in potato yield variability for the whole of Europe, which enhances 
  the risk for this crop. However, crop management strategies (e.g., advanced 
  planting and cultivation of earlier varieties) seem to be effective in overcoming 
  these changes (Wolf, 2000b). Indeterminate root crops such as sugar beet may 
  be expected to benefit from warming and the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
  A study performed by Davies et al. (1996) for England and Wales indicates that 
  the area of suitability for the growth of the crop moves westward. </p>
<p>Forage crops, including maize and whole crop cereals for silage, as well as 
  root crops such as sugar beet and some Brassica species, also are described 
  under cereals and root crops. When these crops are grown as forage crops, yield 
  components and quality may change. Thus, there is a larger emphasis on total 
  biomass yield and on digestability of biomass. The effects on production and 
  quality of wheat whole crop silage will depend on the relative magnitudes of 
  changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature (Sinclair and Seligman, 1995). Yields 
  of the different forage crop types will be affected differentially. Yields of 
  indeterminate crops such as sugar beet and silage maize can be expected to show 
  a larger increase than the yields of whole crop cereals, especially in northern 
  Europe. This probably will lead to changes in the types of forage crops grown. 
  Studies indicate an increase in suitability of the north and west UK to forage 
  maize (Cooper and McGeechan, 1996; Davies et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Perennial crops (e.g., grapevine, olive, and energy crops) have been relatively 
  less studied in the context of climate change impacts. A study on the potential 
  cultivation of grapevine in Europe under future climate scenarios has shown 
  that there is potential for expansion of the wine-growing area in Europe and 
  an increase in yield (see <a href="#fig136">Figure 13-6b</a>). Yet detailed 
  predictions made for the main EU viticultural areas have shown an increase in 
  yield variability (fruit production and quality). The quality of wine in good 
  years is not guaranteed, and the demand for wine in poor years is not met, implying 
  a higher economic risk for growers (Bindi et al., 1996; Bindi and Fibbi, 2000). 
  For olive, it was shown that in a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> case, the suitable area for 
  olive cultivation could be enlarged in France, Italy, Croatia, and Greece as 
  a result of changes in temperature and precipitation patterns (Bindi et al., 
  1992). For indeterminate energy crops that are favored by the longer growing 
  season and by increased WUE resulting from higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, higher 
  temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations generally would be favorable. 
  A study of willow production in the UK found that warming generally would be 
  beneficial for production, with increases in yield of as much as 40% for a temperature 
  increase of 3°K (Evans et al., 1995). Livestock systems may be influenced by 
  climate change directly by means of its effects on animal health, growth, and 
  reproduction and indirectly through its impacts on productivity of pastures 
  and forage crops. Heat stress has several negative effects on animal production, 
  including reduced reproduction and milk production in dairy cows and reduced 
  fertility in pigs (Furquay, 1989). This may negatively affect livestock production 
  in summer in currently warm regions of Europe. Warming during the cold period 
  for cooler regions is likely to be beneficial as a result of reduced feed requirements, 
  increased survival, and lower energy costs. Impacts probably will be minor for 
  intensive livestock systems where climate is controlled. Climate change may 
  affect requirements for insulation and air-conditioning, however, and thus change 
  housing expenses (Cooper et al., 1998). The impact of climate change on grasslands 
  will affect livestock living on these pastures. In Scotland, studies of the 
  effect on grass-based milk production indicate that these effects vary by locality. 
  For herds grazed on grass-clover swards, milk output may increase regardless 
  of site, as a result of the CO<sub>2</sub> effect on nitrogen fixation (Topp 
  and Doyle, 1996b). </p>
<p>Pest-disease-weed-host relationship can be affected by climate change in different 
  ways. Pests, diseases, and weeds that currently are of minor significance may 
  become key species, thereby causing serious losses. The distribution and intensity 
  of current key pest, diseases, and weeds may be affected, leading to changed 
  effects on yield and on control measures such as pesticides and integrated pest 
  management. Competitive abilities in weed-plant interactions may be affected 
  through changes in ecophysiology (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects 
  on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species). Pests and diseases generally will 
  migrate as crops migrate (e.g., Lipa, 1997, 1999).</p>
