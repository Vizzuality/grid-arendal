<h4><a name="15253"></a>15.2.5.3. Coastal Regions Particularly Vulnerable</h4>
<p>The prospect of rising sea level is one of the most widely recognized potential 
  impacts of climate change. Some parts of North America have been experiencing 
  sea-level rise for thousands of years (Hendry, 1993; Lavoie and Asselin, 1998). 
  Most climate models, however, project that the pace will accelerate in many 
  regions. This acceleration would increase the difficulty of adaptation for human 
  settlements and natural systems. The greatest vulnerability is expected in areas 
  that recently have become much more developed, such as Florida and much of the 
  U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Insured property value in Florida alone exceeds 
  US$1 trillion (Nutter, 1999).</p>
<p>Titus and Richman (2001) have developed a data set of coastal land elevations 
  by using digital-elevation models and printed topographic maps to determine 
  areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf 
  coasts. Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and North Carolina account for more than 
  80% of the 58,000 km2 that are vulnerable to sea-level rise.<br>
</p>
<p>Rising sea levels, in turn, can cause increased erosion to shores and habitat 
  and may contaminate some freshwater bodies with salt (Mason, 1999). Climate 
  extremes, such as hurricanes, can add to the adverse impact (Michener <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). Sea-level rise and climate and weather extremes cause problems associated 
  with beach erosion, siltation of waterways, and flood risk in coastal communities 
  (Hanson and Lindh, 1996; Leatherman, 1996).<br>
</p>
<p>More than 65% of people in North America live in coastal communities (Changnon, 
  1992; see also <a href="572.htm#fig152">Figure 15-2</a>). This includes those 
  who live near the Atlantic or Pacific oceans as well as those near the Great 
  Lakes, where the impact of climate change is very different (see Sections <a href="554.htm">15.2.1</a> 
  and <a href="585.htm">15.3.2.5</a>). Accordingly, there is vulnerability across 
  most of the region. Particular concern arises with regard to the combination 
  of sea-level rise with other risks, such as storm surge. Salt intrusion and 
  frequent flooding may adversely impact farming and manufacturing activity in 
  low-lying areas (Gough and Grace, 1998).</p>
<p>Tourism frequently is the major industry in many coastal communities. The risk 
  of beach erosion, siltation, and flooding may become an important challenge 
  for some existing tourism sites, yet these same changes may open new opportunities 
  for some other communities. Tourism has been and will continue to be affected 
  by beach closures resulting from coliform from septic systems and sewage outflows 
  during and following storms and extreme events (see also <a href="577.htm">Section 
  15.2.6</a>). Sea-level rise also will be an important challenge for major ports 
  in many parts of North America. <br>
</p>
<p> A study of the impact on the United States of the increase of sea levels through 
  2065 found losses of US$370 million for dryland, US$893 million for wetlands, 
  and US$57-524 million in transient cost (Yohe <i>et al</i>., 1999). This estimate 
  is much lower than those of earlier U.S. studies because of assumed adaptation 
  responses, including decisions not to protect certain areas. No comparable information 
  is available for Canada, although several vulnerable areas have been identified&#151;particularly 
  the Fraser River delta, Nova Scotia, and the Beaufort Sea region (Shaw <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="15254"></a>15.2.5.4. Vulnerability to System Failure <br>
</h4>
<p> Investments in summer cooling, winter heating, and shelter from the elements 
  are common for most people and businesses in North America. Similar investments 
  are evident around the world, but the scope and scale often is greater in North 
  America. For example, the percentage of homes with air conditioning units in 
  the United States increased from 35% in 1970 (U.S. Census Bureau, 1975) to 76% 
  in 1997 (U.S. Census Bureau, 1999a). Similarly, more vehicles, schools, hospitals, 
  and businesses now have climate control mechanisms. Even traditional tasks have 
  changed, such as air-conditioned cabs on farm vehicles.<br>
</p>
<p>The trend of warming across North America should reduce the cost of heating 
  and the cost of investing in heating systems. At the same time, demand for summer 
  cooling is expected to rise. In turn, changes in the weather affect demand for 
  power: Peak demand for electricity is strongly correlated to swings in summer 
  temperature (Colombo <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Investments to manage normal fluctuations in the weather presumably have been 
  effective in increasing the comfort of people in North America. These investments, 
  however, also have increased vulnerability to systems failure. This could become 
  most evident for most people in North America during a summer heat wave or a 
  winter storm, when a failure in major support systems could place many people 
  at risk. For example, in January 1998, a severe ice storm caused a power failure 
  in Quebec and eastern Ontario (see <a href="585.htm#15326">Section 15.3.2.6</a>). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>A similar investment is in human alteration of hydrological drainage systems, 
  including building of dikes, which may be an important factor in determining 
  the severity of flooding (Changnon and Demissie, 1996). These interventions 
  appear to be successful in managing most variations in the weather, but they 
  can increase vulnerability to extreme events as new investments are made in 
  regions that were thought to be sheltered from severe weather.</p>
