<h3>9.7.5. Schistosomiasis </h3>
<p>Schistosomiasis, which is caused by five species of the trematode (flat worm) 
  Schistosoma, requires water snails as an intermediate host. Worldwide prevalence 
  has risen since the 1950s largely as a result of expansion of irrigation systems 
  in hot climates where viable snail populations can survive and the parasite 
  can find human parasite carriers (Hunter <i>et al</i>., 1993). All three genera 
  of snail hosts (Bulinus, Biomphalaria, and Oncomelania) can tolerate a wide 
  temperature range. At low temperatures, snails are effectively dormant and fecundity 
  is virtually zero, but survival is good. At high temperatures, births (egg production) 
  increase, but so does mortality (<a href="361.htm#tab93">Table 9-3</a>). However, 
  snails are mobile and can move to avoid extreme temperatures within their habitats; 
  water can act as an efficient insulator (Hairston, 1973; Gillett, 1974; Schiff 
  <i>et al</i>., 1979). The precise conditions within water bodies that determine 
  transmission depend on a host of environmental factors, including local geology 
  and topography, the general hydrology of the region, the presence or absence 
  of aquatic vegetation, and local agricultural usage (Appleton and Stiles, 1976; 
  Appleton, 1977). In east Africa, colonies of Biomphalaria and Bulinus spp. persist 
  at altitudes of 2,000 m or more, but transmission&#151;if it occurs at all&#151;is 
  restricted to brief warm seasons. Climate change might allow schistosomiasis 
  transmission to extend its range to higher altitudes. Conversely, increasing 
  temperatures at sea level could decrease transmission unless the snails move 
  to cooler refuges. <br>
</p>
<p>Water shortages resulting from climate change could create greater need for 
  irrigation, particularly in arid regions. If irrigation systems expand to meet 
  this need, host snail populations may increase (Schorr <i>et al</i>., 1984), leading 
  to greater risk of human infection with the parasite. However, this impact could 
  be reduced by constructing irrigation systems that are not conducive to snail 
  breeding.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="976"></a>9.7.6. Chagas' Disease </h3>
<p>The geographical distribution of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) 
  is limited to the Americas, ranging from the southern United States to southern 
  Argentina and Chile (Carcavallo <i>et al</i>., 1998, 1999). Chagas' disease 
  is transmitted by triatomine bugs (see <a href="361.htm#tab93">Table 9-3</a>). 
  Temperature affects the major components of VC (reviewed by Zeled&oacute;n and 
  Rabinovich, 1981; Carcavallo, 1999). If temperatures exceed 30&deg;C and humidity 
  does not increase sufficiently, the bugs increase their feeding rate to avoid 
  dehydration. If indoor temperatures rise, vector species in the domestic environment 
  may develop shorter life cycles and higher population densities (Carcavallo 
  and Curto de Casas, 1996). High temperatures also accelerate development of 
  the pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi, in the vector (Asin and Catal&aacute;, 1995). 
  Many vector species are domesticated. Lazzari <i>et al</i>. (1998) found that 
  in the majority of structures, differences between inside and outside temperature 
  were small, although differences in humidity were significant. Triatomine dispersal 
  also is sensitive to temperature (Schofield <i>et al</i>., 1992). Population 
  density of domestic vectors also is significantly affected by human activities 
  to control or eradicate the disease (e.g., replastering of walls, insecticide 
  spraying). The southern limits of Triatoma infestans and Chagas' disease distributions 
  recently have been moved significantly inside their climatically suitable limits 
  by large-scale control campaigns (Schofield and Dias, 1999). </p>
<h3><a name="977"></a>9.7.7. Plague<br>
</h3>
<p>Plague is a bacterial disease that is transmitted by the bite of infected fleas 
  (Xenopsylla cheopis), by inhaling infective bacteria, and, less often, by direct 
  contact with infected animals (Gage, 1998). Plague exists focally in all regions 
  except Europe. Notable plague outbreaks have occurred in several Asian, African, 
  and South American countries in the past 10 years (John, 1996; WHO, 1997; Gage, 
  1998; PAHO, 1998). It is unclear whether climate change may affect the distribution 
  and incidence of plague. There does appear to be a correlation between rainfall 
  patterns and rodent populations (Parmenter <i>et al</i>., 1999; see also <a href="365.htm">Section 
  9.7.9</a>). Prospective field research studies must be conducted to confirm 
  this. </p>
<h3><a name="978"></a>9.7.8. Tick-Borne Diseases</h3>
<p>Tick-borne diseases&#151;in particular, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted 
  fever, ehrlichiosis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)&#151;are the most common 
  vector-borne diseases in temperate zones in the northern hemisphere. Ticks are 
  ectoparasites; their geographical distribution depends on the distribution of 
  suitable host species&#151;usually mammals or birds (Glass <i>et al</i>., 1994; 
  Wilson, 1998). Species that transmit these diseases have complex life cycles 
  that require 3 years and three different hosts species&#151;one for each stage 
  of the cycle (larvae, nymph, and adult). Climate directly and indirectly influences 
  the tick vector, its habitat, host and reservoir animals, time between blood 
  meals, and pathogen transmission. Bioclimatic threshold temperatures set limits 
  for tick distribution and are of importance for the magnitude of disease occurrence 
  (<a href="361.htm#tab93">Table 9-3</a>). Temperatures must be sufficiently high 
  for completion of the tick's life cycle. Humidity must be sufficient to prevent 
  tick eggs from drying out. Temperatures above the optimum range reduce the survival 
  rate of ticks. In temperate countries, tick vectors are active in the spring, 
  summer, and early autumn months.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 decades, marked increases have been reported in the abundance 
  of ticks and the incidence of tick-borne disease in North America and Europe. 
  In North America, these changes have been attributed to an increase in awareness 
  of tick-borne diseases and increased abundance of wild tick hosts (principally 
  deer), as reforestation has expanded areas of suitable habitat (Dennis, 1998). 
  There is some evidence that the northern limit of distribution of the tick vector 
  (Ixodes ricinus) and tick density increased in Sweden between the early 1980s 
  and 1994, concurrent with an increased frequency of milder winters (Talleklint 
  and Jaenson, 1998; Lindgren <i>et al</i>., 2000). In New York state, Ixodes 
  scapularis has expanded its geographic distribution northward and westward in 
  the past 10 years. The reasons for this expansion are unknown.</p>
