<h4>5.4.3.3. Impacts on Goods and Services with Market Values </h4>
<h4><a name="54331"></a>5.4.3.3.1. Control of pest species and disease vectors</h4>
<p>Wildlife plays a role in natural and agricultural ecosystems through reduction 
  of injurious insect pests and disease vectors. In some forested ecosystems, 
  birds, together with parasitoids and other insect predators, are effective predators 
  of insect pests (Crawford and Jennings, 1989; see Price et al., 2000). Insects, 
  ants, and spiders also play key roles in reducing populations of pest insects. 
  For example, when ants were removed from maize plots in Nicaragua, two pest 
  species increased in abundance, and damage to the maize increased (Perfecto, 
  1991). The annual economic value of wildlife control of insect pests has been 
  estimated to be hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars (de Groot, 1992; Pimentel 
  et al., 1992, 1993; Pimentel, 1997). This includes destruction of pests that 
  are injurious to crops (estimated at US$90 billion year in the United States 
  alone), as well as those affecting forests.</p>
<p>Climate change could impact many of these systems by decoupling predators from 
  their prey (Root and Schneider, 1995). Studies in North America project reductions 
  in the extent of distribution size of some of the species that feed on pests 
  in forest, grassland, and agricultural ecosystems (see Price, 1995; Price et 
  al., 2000). This could lead to an increasing need to use pesticides, with accompanying 
  health risks (human and wildlife) and economic costs (Kirk et al., 1996; Colburn 
  et al., 1997; Herremans, 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="54332"></a>5.4.3.3.2. Pollinators</h4>
<p>Pollination is crucial to the reproduction of many plants, thus to maintenance 
  of functioning ecosystems and biodiversity. Many factors influence the occurrence 
  and density of insects (e.g., habitat conversion, excessive pesticide use). 
  The principal mode of pollination of many plant species is by insects. Worldwide, 
  an estimated 400 crop species are pollinated by bees and more than 30 other 
  animal genera; possible crop loss in some species would be more than 90% in 
  the absence of bees (Southwick, 1992; Buchmann and Nabhan, 1996). More than 
  100,000 different animals around the world pollinate 250,000 types of plants 
  (Buchmann and Nabhan, 1996). The estimated annual value of wildlife pollination 
  to commercial crops and pasture grasses is tens of billions of U.S. dollars 
  (de Groot, 1992; Pimentel et al., 1992, 1995). If pollination of noncommercial 
  plants were added, the figure would be significantly higher.</p>
<h4><a name="54333"></a>5.4.3.3.3. Seed dispersal</h4>
<p>Seeds of some plants are dispersed by one or a few animal species. In Costa 
  Rican tropical deciduous forests, as many as 60% of plants have their seeds 
  dispersed by birds; the numbers are 75% in subtropical evergreen forests and 
  80% in montane evergreen forests (Bawa, 1995). On Samoa, the vast majority of 
  seed dispersal in the dry season is mediated by flying foxes (Cox et al., 1991). 
  Plants commonly disperse via seeds passing through the digestive tracts of animals 
  or with animals that cache seeds (Robinson and Handel, 1993; Lanner, 1996). 
  Consequently, if the ranges of the appropriate animals become disjunct from 
  even part of the ranges of specific plants, dispersal of the plants may suffer 
  (see Price et al., 2000, for other examples).</p>
