<h3><a name="1627"></a>16.2.7. Changes in Arctic Biota</h3>
<h4><a name="16271"></a>16.2.7.1. Impacts of Climate Change on Arctic Terrestrial 
  Environments</h4>
<p>Northern environments are thought to be particularly sensitive to climate warming, 
  owing to changes in surface albedo degradation of permafrost, increased active-layer 
  thickness, and earlier snowmelt. Recent warming reflects partial replacement 
  of dry Arctic air masses by wetter Atlantic, Pacific, and southerly air masses, 
  particularly in the subarctic and southern Arctic (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  Most of the increase is related to higher late-winter and early-spring air temperatures 
  (+4.5&deg;C), whereas summer temperatures in the region have increased by only 
  about 2&deg;C (Chapman and Walsh, 1993). In parts of Alaska, growing-season 
  length has increased over the past 65 years as a result of reductions in snow 
  and ice cover (Sharratt, 1992; Groisman <i>et al</i>., 1994). The annual amplitude 
  of the seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> cycle also has increased recently by as much 
  as 40% (Keeling <i>et al</i>., 1996). There has been an accompanying advance 
  in the timing of spring by about 7 days and a delay in autumn by the same period, 
  leading to an expected lengthening of the growing season (Keeling <i>et al</i>., 
  1996). Such trends are likely to continue with projected climate change.</p>
<p>Precipitation will increase during the summer months, but evaporation and transpiration 
  rates also are predicted to increase; this, together with earlier snowmelt, 
  will lead to soil moisture deficits later in the summer (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). These changes in moisture and the thermal regimes of arctic soils ultimately 
  will determine the fate of soil carbon stored in permafrost and the active layer 
  (Miller <i>et al</i>., 1983, Billings, 1987; Gorham, 1991; Schlesinger, 1991). 
  Any change in physical properties in the active layer will have an impact on 
  organisms and abiotic variables (Gates <i>et al</i>., 1992; Kane <i>et al</i>., 
  1992; Waelbroeck, 1993; Groisman <i>et al</i>., 1994). The effects of changed 
  drainage patterns and active-layer detachments (Dyke, 2000)&#151;increasing 
  sediment-nutrient loads in lakes and rivers&#151;will alter biological productivity 
  in aquatic ecosystems considerably (McDonald <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>Changes in the relative abundance of soil biota are predicted to affect soil 
  processes, but only in a modest way. The rate of decomposition of organic matter 
  is expected to rise with an increase in soil temperature and a longer growing 
  season. This is likely to lead to enhanced rates of gross mineralization. However, 
  the high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of organic soils may still limit the availability 
  of nitrogen to plants. If the thickened active layer extends into mineral layers, 
  the release of mineral nutrients may be increased greatly, causing the upper 
  organic layer to become more alkaline (Heal, 1998).</p>
<p>In summary, climate change probably will release more soil nutrients to biota, 
  but nutrient limitations&#151;especially of nitrogen and phosphorus&#151;still 
  are likely to occur. Studies have identified that the combination of nutrient 
  and temperature increases results in the increasing importance of dominant plant 
  species and suppression of subordinate ones. Species richness increased in an 
  Arctic site, as a result of invasion of nitrophilous species, but decreased 
  in a subarctic site. The impact of higher nutrient supplies and temperatures 
  are likely to exceed those of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and UV-B as measured in 
  a related experiment (Press <i>et al</i>., 1998). Because little is known about 
  interactions between species within the soil and hence overall community response, 
  the effect of climate change on rates of tundra soil decomposition and carbon 
  loss is hard to predict (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1998b).</p>
<h4><a name="16272"></a>16.2.7.2. Response of Arctic Plant Communities </h4>
<p>There are a wide range of physiological responses of Arctic plants to climate 
  change. Evidence indicates that changes will be at the level of individual species 
  rather than groups of species (Chapin <i>et al</i>., 1997; Callaghan <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Some responses to increased nutrient supply are specific to particular 
  growth forms, such as the positive response of forbs, graminoids, and deciduous 
  shrubs and the negative responses of mosses, lichens, and evergreen shrubs (Jonasson, 
  1992; Chapin <i>et al</i>., 1995, 1996; Callaghan <i>et al</i>., 1998; Shaver 
  and Jonasson, 1999). The direct growth responses of evergreen dwarf shrubs to 
  increased temperatures are small (Havstr&ouml;m <i>et al</i>., 1993; Wookey 
  <i>et al</i>., 1993; Chapin <i>et al</i>., 1995, 1996). This is in contrast 
  to the growth rates of graminoids, forbs, and deciduous dwarf shrubs (Wookey 
  <i>et al</i>., 1994; Henry and Molau, 1997; Arft <i>et al</i>., 1999). In the 
  Arctic, where these growth forms are abundant, there is a significant increase 
  in plant biomass in response to increased temperatures in summer (Henry and 
  Molau, 1997). The response of reproductive and vegetative structures to warming 
  will vary, depending on abiotic constraints (Wookey <i>et al</i>., 1994; Arft 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Warming in the winter and spring may encourage premature 
  growth, so subsequent frost can lead to damage in plants (e.g., as discussed 
  for Vaccinium myrtillus by Laine <i>et al</i>., 1995, and for Diapensia lapponica 
  by Molau, 1996). In northern Europe, processes that control the transition from 
  boreal forest to tundra are more complicated than in North America because of 
  infrequent large-scale defoliation of birch forest by geometrid moths. The eggs 
  of the moths, which are killed at low temperatures, are likely to survive if 
  winter temperatures increase (Neuvonen <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere also could directly 
  affect photosynthesis and growth rates of Arctic plants, but the effects are 
  not easily predictable. For example, a rise in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  in the air leads to an initial increase in photosynthesis in individual tussocks 
  of Eriophorum vaginatum. However, this effect can disappear in as little as 
  3 weeks as a result of homeostatic adjustment, indicating a loss of photosynthetic 
  potential has occurred (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1997). Such short-lived responses 
  are thought to be caused by limitations in nutrient (especially nitrogen) availability 
  (Chapin and Shaver, 1985; Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1997). At the ecosystem level 
  in tussock tundra plots, the homeostatic adjustment took 3 years&#151;by which 
  time enhanced rates of net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake had disappeared entirely, in 
  spite of substantial photosynthetic carbon gain during the period (Oechel <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994). Adjustment of the photosynthetic rate was thought to be caused 
  by nutrient limitation. K&ouml;rner <i>et al</i>. (1996) also have reported 
  an increase in net CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation of 41% in Carex curvula after 
  2 years of exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, but plant growth changes were 
  minimal. Exposure of plants to increased temperatures and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  indicated that the initial stimulation in net CO<sub>2</sub> flux persisted, 
  for reasons that are not entirely clear, although it may be linked to increased 
  nutrient availability (Oechel and Vourlitis, 1994; Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1994, 
  1997). </p>
