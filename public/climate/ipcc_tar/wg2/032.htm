<p><i><a name="figts4"></a>The response of crop yields to climate change varies 
  widely, depending on the species, cultivar, soil conditions, treatment of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  direct effects, and other locational factors.</i> It is established with medium 
  confidence that a few degrees of projected warming will lead to general increases 
  in temperate crop yields, with some regional variation (<a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 
  5-4</a>). At larger amounts of projected warming, most temperate crop yield 
  responses become generally negative. Autonomous agronomic adaptation ameliorates 
  temperate crop yield loss and improves gain in most cases (<a href="#figts4">Figure 
  TS-4</a>). In the tropics, where some crops are near their maximum temperature 
  tolerance and where dryland agriculture predominates, yields would decrease 
  generally with even minimal changes in temperature; where there is a large decrease 
  in rainfall, crop yields would be even more adversely affected (medium confidence). 
  With autonomous agronomic adaptation, it is established with medium confidence 
  that crop yields in the tropics tend to be less adversely affected by climate 
  change than without adaptation, but they still tend to remain below baseline 
  levels. Extreme events also will affect crop yields. Higher minimum temperatures 
  will be beneficial to some crops, especially in temperate regions, and detrimental 
  to other crops, especially in low latitudes (high confidence). Higher maximum 
  temperatures will be generally detrimental to numerous crops (high confidence). 
  [<a href="209.htm#533">5.3.3</a>]</p>
<p><i>Important advances in research since the SAR on the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  on crops suggest that beneficial effects may be greater under certain stressful 
  conditions, including warmer temperatures and drought.</i> Although these effects 
  are well established for a few crops under experimental conditions, knowledge 
  of them is incomplete for suboptimal conditions of actual farms. Research on 
  agricultural adaptation to climate change also has made important advances. 
  Inexpensive, farm-level (autonomous) agronomic adaptations such as altering 
  of planting dates and cultivar selections have been simulated in crop models 
  extensively. More expensive, directed adaptations&#151; such as changing land-use 
  allocations and developing and using irrigation infrastructure&#151;have been 
  examined in a small but growing number of linked crop-economic models, integrated 
  assessment models, and econometric models.</p>
<p><i>Degradation of soil and water resources is one of the major future challenges 
  for global agriculture.</i> It is established with high confidence that those 
  processes are likely to be intensified by adverse changes in temperature and 
  precipitation. Land use and management have been shown to have a greater impact 
  on soil conditions than the indirect effect of climate change; thus, adaptation 
  has the potential to significantly mitigate these impacts. A critical research 
  need is to assess whether resource degradation will significantly increase the 
  risks faced by vulnerable agricultural and rural populations [<a href="209.htm">5.3.2</a>, 
  <a href="213.htm#534">5.3.4</a>, <a href="216.htm#536">5.3.6</a>].</p>
<p>In the absence of climate change, most global and regional studies project 
  declining real prices for agricultural commodities. Confidence in these projections 
  declines farther into the future. <i>The impacts of climate change on agriculture 
  are estimated to result in small percentage changes in global income, with positive 
  changes in more developed regions and smaller or negative changes in developing 
  regions (low to medium confidence).</i> The effectiveness of adaptation (agronomic 
  and economic) in ameliorating the impacts of climate change will vary regionally 
  and depend a great deal on regional resource endowments, including stable and 
  effective institutions. [<a href="208.htm#531">5.3.1</a>, <a href="216.htm">5.3.5</a>]</p>
<p><i>Most studies indicate that mean annual temperature increases of 2.5&ordm;C 
  or greater would prompt food prices to increase (low confidence) as a result 
  of slowing in the expansion of global food capacity relative to growth in global 
  food demand.</i> At lesser amounts of warming than 2.5&ordm;C, global impact 
  assessment models cannot distinguish the climate change signal from other sources 
  of change. Some recent aggregated studies have estimated economic impacts on 
  vulnerable populations such as smallholder producers and poor urban consumers. 
  These studies indicate that climate change will lower the incomes of vulnerable 
  populations and increase the absolute number of people at risk of hunger (low 
  confidence). [<a href="216.htm">5.3.5</a>, <a href="216.htm#536">5.3.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Without autonomous adaptation, increases in extreme events are likely to 
  increase heat stress-related livestock deaths, although winter warming may reduce 
  neonatal deaths at temperate latitudes (established but incomplete).</i> Strategies 
  to adapt livestock to physiological stresses of warming are considered effective; 
  however, adaptation research is hindered by the lack of experimentation and 
  simulation. [<a href="209.htm#533">5.3.3</a>]</p>
<p>Confidence in specific numerical estimates of climate change impacts on production, 
  income, and prices obtained from large, aggregated, integrated assessment models 
  is considered to be low because there are several remaining uncertainties. The 
  models are highly sensitive to some parameters that have been subjected to sensitivity 
  analysis, yet sensitivity to a large number of other parameters has not been 
  reported. Other uncertainties include the magnitude and persistence of effects 
  of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on crop yield under realistic farming conditions; 
  potential changes in crop and animal pest losses; spatial variability in crop 
  responses to climate change; and the effects of changes in climate variability 
  and extreme events on crops and livestock. [<a href="208.htm#box53">Box 5-3</a>]</p>
