<h4>5.6.2.2.3. Pressures from other disturbances </h4>
<p>Additional disturbances are associated with extreme weather events such as 
  hurricanes, tornadoes, unexpected drought or heavy rainfall, flooding, and icestorms 
  that lead to extensive mortality and ecosystem change (e.g., Lugo et al., 1990; 
  Walker and Waide, 1991). Such events generally are highly localized and take 
  place in a relatively short period of time but have long-term economic impacts 
  (Haight et al., 1995) and effects on ecosystems (Pontailler et al., 1997). There 
  is some evidence of recent increases in damage from such extreme events (Berz, 
  1999; see also <a href="321.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="347.htm">9</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="5623"></a>5.6.2.3. Changing Demand for Forest Goods and Services</h4>
<p>Future demand for industrial wood products depends on income growth, population 
  growth, technological change, growth in human capital, changes in tastes and 
  preferences, and institutional and political change (Solberg et al., 1996). 
  Changes in other markets also can influence demand for wood products. For example, 
  increases in the price of substitutes, such as steel and concrete building materials, 
  would increase the demand for industrial timber. In light of these driving factors, 
  recent timber market assessments have predicted that industrial harvests will 
  increase by 1-2% yr<sup>-1</sup> (Solberg et al., 1996; Brooks, 1997; FAO, 
  1997b; Sohngen et al., 1999). These results contrast with those in the SAR (Solomon 
  et al., 1996), which concluded that global demand for industrial fiber would 
  exceed global supply in the next century. </p>
<p>There is some debate about which forests are likely to be harvested in the 
  future. Some authors contend that most supply will come from new industrial 
  plantations, secondary growth forests, and enhanced management, rather than 
  from native forests (FAO, 1997b; Sohngen et al., 1999). The proportion of global 
  timber from subtropical plantations (presently 10%) may increase to 40% by 2050 
  (Sohngen et al., 1999). Non-native species, such as eucalypts and pines, are 
  favored in these regions because the costs of management and harvesting are 
  low compared to those in temperate and boreal forests (Sedjo and Lyon, 1990; 
  Sedjo, 1999). Recent estimates use global timber market models that incorporate 
  management responses to prices across a wide range of forests. Under most price 
  scenarios, subtropical plantations with 5- to 20-year rotations are a financially 
  attractive alternative (Sedjo, 1999). However, higher demand still may put pressures 
  on native forests even if plantation establishment and forest management responds 
  to price increases (Solberg et al., 1996; Brooks, 1997).</p>
<p>Policies that raise prices for substitute products, such as non-wood building 
  materials made from steel or plastics, may increase timber demand, increase 
  non-native plantation establishment, and cause additional pressures on native 
  forests. Substituting non-wood products for wood products could increase carbon 
  emissions as well (Marland and Schlamadinger, 1995; Schlamadinger et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Increased reliance on plantations may have positive and negative ancillary 
  consequences. For example, most of the plantations established for industrial 
  purposes involve nonindigenous species, and the environmental effects of these 
  plantations are not fully evident. However, most plantations have been established 
  on former agricultural lands, which begins the process of restoring forests 
  (Lugo et al., 1993). Furthermore, plantations may reduce harvest pressures on 
  natural forests. Despite increased reliance on plantations, however, industrial 
  harvests in native forests along accessible roadways are likely to continue 
  (Johns et al., 1996). </p>
<p>The relationship between income and fuelwood demand is nonlinear. As incomes 
  rise and infrastructure grows, households substitute alternative fuel sources 
  (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil). Brooks et al. (1996), for example, suggest that 
  fuelwood harvests will increase by 17% by 2050 under a low-GDP-growth scenario, 
  but only by 4% under a high-growth scenario. Fuelwood harvest depends on the 
  extent of substitution by alternative methods of heating and cooking. Currently, 
  use of wood for energy on a large scale does not appear to be cost-effective 
  relative to other energy sources, but if future energy prices rise, the demand 
  for wood as a source of energy could rise.</p>
