<p><a name="box21"></a>Uncertainty&#151;or, more generally, debate about the level 
  of certainty required to reach a "definitive" conclusion&#151;is a 
  perennial issue in science. Difficulties in explaining uncertainty have become 
  increasingly salient as society seeks policy advice to deal with global environmental 
  change. How can science be useful when evidence is incomplete or ambiguous, 
  the subjective judgments of experts in the scientific and popular literature 
  differ, and policymakers seek guidance and justification for courses of action 
  that could cause&#151;or prevent&#151;significant environmental and societal 
  changes? How can scientists improve their characterization of uncertainties 
  so that areas of slight disagreement do not become equated with paradigmatic 
  disputes, and how can individual subjective judgments be aggregated into group 
  positions? In short, how can the full spectrum of the scientific content of 
  public policy debates be fairly and openly assessed?</p>
<p>The term "uncertainty" implies anything from confidence just short 
  of certainty to informed guesses or speculation. Lack of information obviously 
  results in uncertainty; often, however, disagreement about what is known or 
  even knowable is a source of uncertainty. Some categories of uncertainty are 
  amenable to quantification, whereas other kinds cannot be expressed sensibly 
  in terms of probabilities (see Schneider <i>et al</i>., 1998, for a survey of 
  literature on characterizations of uncertainty). Uncertainties arise from factors 
  such as lack of knowledge of basic scientific relationships, linguistic imprecision, 
  statistical variation, measurement error, variability, approximation, and subjective 
  judgment (see <a href="#box21">Box 2-1</a>). These problems are compounded by 
  the global scale of climate change, but local scales of impacts, long time lags 
  between forcing and response, low-frequency variability with characteristic 
  times that are greater than the length of most instrumental records, and the 
  impossibility of before-the-fact experimental controls also come into play. 
  Moreover, it is important to recognize that even good data and thoughtful analysis 
  may be insufficient to dispel some aspects of uncertainty associated with the 
  different standards of evidence (Morgan, 1998; Casman <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>This section considers methods to address such questions: first by briefly 
  examining treatments of uncertainties in past IPCC assessments, next by reviewing 
  recommendations from a guidance paper on uncertainties (Moss and Schneider, 
  2000) prepared for the TAR, and third by briefly assessing the state of the 
  science concerning the debate over the quality of human judgments (subjective 
  confidence) when empirical evidence is insufficient to form clear "objective" 
  statements of the likelihood that certain events will occur.</p>
