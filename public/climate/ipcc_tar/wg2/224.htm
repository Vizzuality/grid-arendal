<h4>5.4.3.2. Model Projections of Wildlife Responses </h4>
<p>Invertebrates: Because changes in the distribution of disease vectors, such 
  as mosquitoes, and crop and forest pests can have major human health and economic 
  impacts, most modeling of changes in insect range and abundance have focused 
  on pest species (Sutherst et al., 1995). In southern Africa, models project 
  changes in the ranges of tsetse flies, ticks, and mosquitoes (Rogers, 1996). 
  Potential range changes of other disease vectors are discussed in <a href="347.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>.</p>
<p>High proportions of boreal forest insect pests overwinter as eggs. The strong 
  link between patterns of minimum temperature and the location of outbreaks are 
  best explained by the fact that eggs are killed when temperatures dip below 
  a species' tolerance threshold (Sullivan, 1965; Austara, 1971; Virtanen 
  et al., 1996). Modeling work that is based on these observations and projected 
  climate data suggests that increasing nighttime winter temperatures may increase 
  the frequency of these pest species in northern areas (Tenow, 1996; Virtanen 
  et al., 1996, 1998), although warmer summer temperatures may reduce the intensity 
  of outbreaks (Niemel&auml;, 1980; Neuvonen et al., 1999; Virtanen and Neuvonen, 
  1999; but see Ayres, 1993). </p>
<p>Amphibians and Reptiles: In studies on altitudinal (Pettus and Angleton, 1967; 
  Licht, 1975; Bizer, 1978; Berven, 1982a,b) and latitudinal (Collins, 1979) gradients, 
  a general pattern of faster metamorphosis at smaller sizes occurs at high elevations 
  and northern latitudes. Changes in these life history attributes may affect 
  species' abundances as a result of susceptibility to predators or environmental 
  extremes or changes in reproductive output (Calef, 1973; Travis, 1981). Species 
  that inhabit high-altitude areas may be at particular risk from climate change 
  because as temperatures increase, their habitats may disappear (Hamilton, 1995; 
  Pounds et al., 1999). In Australia, frog distributions are strongly correlated 
  with patterns of annual rainfall, implying that frogs in these areas may be 
  able to expand their ranges if precipitation increases (Tyler, 1994). Reptile 
  ranges often correlate with temperature (Nix, 1986; Owen and Dixon, 1989; Yom-Tov 
  and Werner, 1996), suggesting that ranges may shift with temperature change. 
  Desert tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) in southern Morocco already have shifted 
  their ranges in response to drier conditions possibly resulting from land-use 
  changes (Bayley and Highfield, 1996). </p>
<p>Birds: In the prairie pothole region of the United States and Canada, a significant 
  correlation between wetlands, duck numbers, and the Palmer Drought Severity 
  Index has been found (Sorenson et al., 1998). Projections of warming and drying 
  for this region suggest that the number of wetlands and, correspondingly, the 
  number of breeding ducks could be reduced. Similar losses of wetlands have been 
  projected for Africa (Magadza, 1996) and Australia (Hassal and Associates, 1998).</p>
<p>Mammals: Population reductions in mammals in African arid lands are possible 
  if the incidence of drought increases (IPCC, 1998). In Australia, declines in 
  several mammal species may occur if droughts increase in frequency or intensity 
  (Caughley et al., 1985; Roberston, 1986; Gordon et al., 1988). Mountains (see 
  <a href="220.htm#5431">Section 5.4.3.1</a>), patchy habitats, and oceans can 
  be barriers to range shifts. The Arctic Ocean is an obstacle to 25 species of 
  Canadian mammals, with the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) possibly 
  losing at least 60% of its available habitat to climate change (Kerr and Packer, 
  1998). </p>
<p>The nutritional quality of some plant species has been found to decrease with 
  increased CO<sub>2</sub> availability (Bazzaz, 1996). This could mean that herbivores might 
  have to eat more. Most studies have dealt with insect or domestic mammals, but 
  similar results are likely to hold for wild herbivorous mammals (Baker et al., 
  1993; Bolortsetseg and Tuvaansuren, 1996). Relative changes in major plant lifeforms 
  also can affect species distributions and populations densities; for example, 
  in high-latitude rangelands, shrub abundance may increase and forb abundance 
  may decrease (Chapin et al., 1995), possibly leading to limitations on food 
  supplies available to migrating caribou (White and Trudell, 1980). </p>
