<h4><a name="15233"></a>15.2.3.3. Marine Fisheries</h4>
<p>Climate-related variations in marine/coastal environments are now recognized 
  as playing an important role in determining the productivity of several North 
  American fisheries. For example, large changes in species abundance and ecosystem 
  dynamics off the coast of California have been associated with changes in sea-surface 
  temperatures (SSTs), nutrient supply, and circulation dynamics (Ebbesmeyer <i>et al</i>., 1991; Roemmich and McGowan, 1995; Bakun, 1996). Similar relationships have 
  been observed in the Bering Sea, the northeastern Pacific, and the Gulf of Alaska 
  (Polovina <i>et al</i>., 1995; Ware, 1995; Shuntov <i>et al</i>., 1996; Beamish <i>et al</i>., 1997; 
  Downton and Miller, 1998; Francis <i>et al</i>., 1998; Beamish <i>et al</i>., 1999a, 2000) 
  and in the North Atlantic (Atkinson <i>et al</i>., 1997; Sinclair <i>et al</i>., 1997; Hofmann 
  and Powell, 1998). In the Gulf of Mexico, variations in freshwater discharge 
  affect harvests of some commercially important species (Hofmann and Powell, 
  1998). Projected climate changes have the potential to affect coastal and marine 
  ecosystems through changes in coastal habitats, upwelling, temperature, salinity, 
  and current regimes. Such changes may affect the abundance and spatial distribution 
  of species that are important to commercial and recreational fisheries (Boesch 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Fishery management involves the difficult task of maintaining viable fish populations 
  in the presence of difficult-to-predict shifts in resource availability, while 
  regulating competition among harvesters for access to publicly managed, common-property 
  fishery resources (McKay, 1995; Fujita <i>et al</i>., 1998; Myers and Mertz, 1998; 
  Roughgarden, 1998). Attainment of management objectives may be confounded by 
  the fact that some fish stocks tend to fluctuate widely from year to year. These 
  fluctuations may arise from natural causes that are unrelated to fishing pressure 
  or be exacerbated by harvesting. The exact cause of a sudden shift in abundance 
  often is poorly understood. Climate variations often play a role in natural 
  fluctuations, although their role may be complex and indirect. For example, 
  a climatic variation may affect phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance in some 
  part of the ocean, with cascading effects through a chain of predator-prey relationships 
  (Bakun, 1996). These processes may result in multiple and lagged impacts on 
  the abundance of a harvested species. Because it is difficult to identify and 
  predict such effects, climate variability constitutes a significant source of 
  uncertainty for fishery managers. <br>
</p>
<p>The potential impacts of climate change on fish populations are equally difficult 
  to predict. Some work has focused on the direct impacts of warmer temperatures 
  on marine species (e.g., Wood and McDonald, 1997; Welch <i>et al</i>., 1998a,b). However, 
  Bakun (1996) notes that climate variables that are important on land (e.g., 
  temperature and precipitation) may be relatively unimportant for organisms that 
  live in the ocean. He identifies three basic processes (enrichment, concentration, 
  and transport /retention) that influence the productivity and spatial distribution 
  of marine fish populations but notes that very little is known regarding how 
  these will change with global climate change.<br>
</p>
<p>Efforts to assess the impacts of climate change on the U.S. fishery sector 
  are severely hampered by our current lack of understanding of possible changes 
  in fish populations. Markowski <i>et al</i>. (1999) performed a sensitivity analysis 
  that examined the potential economic impacts of hypothetical changes in the 
  abundance of selected fish populations, but the analysis is too hypothetical 
  for use here.<br>
</p>
<p>Uncertainty regarding the magnitude and sources of variations in fish stocks 
  also creates political stumbling blocks to effective fisheries management. Within 
  single jurisdictions, competing harvesters and gear groups vie for shares of 
  a "pie" whose dimensions are imperfectly known. In the case of international 
  fisheries, cooperative harvesting agreements often have degenerated into mutually 
  destructive fish wars when expectations have been upset by unforeseen changes 
  in abundance or the spatial pattern of availability (McKelvey, 1997). For example, 
  the Pacific Salmon Treaty foundered for several years because declining runs 
  of southern coho and chinook salmon and increasing salmon abundance in Alaskan 
  waters frustrated efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable balance of U.S. and 
  Canadian interceptions of one another's salmon stocks (Munro <i>et al</i>., 1998; 
  Miller, 2000a).<br>
</p>
<p>Accounts of the collapse of cod stocks off Newfoundland on Canada's east 
  coast have cited the inability of governments to effectively control fishing 
  pressure and a natural shift to less favorable environmental conditions (Hutchings 
  and Myers, 1994; Sinclair <i>et al</i>., 1997; Hofmann and Powell, 1998). This case 
  suggests that sustainable fisheries management will require timely and accurate 
  scientific information on the environmental conditions that affect fish stocks 
  and institutional flexibility to respond quickly to such information.<br>
</p>
<p>The western U.S.-Mexican border region is located between subtropical and mid-latitude 
  ocean regions. Variations in temperature in this transition zone result in major 
  fluctuations in fisheries productivity (Lluch <i>et al</i>., 1991). In recent decades, 
  this region of the Pacific has shown a trend toward warming and changes in regional 
  productivity, independent of overexploitation. In a global warming scenario, 
  the sardine population may decrease along the U.S.-Mexican Pacific Ocean border 
  region, whereas the shrimp population may increase. Interdecadal natural climate 
  variability, however, appears to be the most important sardine population modulator 
  (Lluch-Cota <i>et al</i>., 1997).<br>
</p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that there are likely to be impacts on fisheries 
  arising, for example, from changes in current dynamics, temperature-dependent 
  distribution, and food web dynamics. These impacts will be variable across species 
  and locations and are difficult to forecast with any precision. Because the 
  effects of exploitation and environmental change can be synergistic, it will 
  be increasingly important to consider changing environmental conditions in future 
  fisheries management (Boesch <i>et al</i>., 2000; see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> for further discussion).</p>
