<h3><a name="434"></a>4.3.4. Soil Moisture</h3>
<p>The amount of water stored in the soil is fundamentally important to agriculture 
  and is an influence on the rate of actual evaporation, groundwater recharge, 
  and generation of runoff. Soil moisture contents are directly simulated by global 
  climate models, albeit over a very coarse spatial resolution, and outputs from 
  these models give an indication of possible directions of change. Gregory et 
  al. (1997), for example, show with the HadCM2 climate model that a rise in greenhouse 
  gas (GHG) concentrations is associated with reduced soil moisture in Northern 
  Hemisphere mid-latitude summers. This was the result of higher winter and spring 
  evaporation, caused by higher temperatures and reduced snow cover, and lower 
  rainfall inputs during summer. </p>
<p>The local effects of climate change on soil moisture, however, will vary not 
  only with the degree of climate change but also with soil characteristics. The 
  water-holding capacity of soil will affect possible changes in soil moisture 
  deficits; the lower the capacity, the greater the sensitivity to climate change. 
  Climate change also may affect soil characteristics, perhaps through changes 
  in waterlogging or cracking, which in turn may affect soil moisture storage 
  properties. Infiltration capacity and water-holding capacity of many soils are 
  influenced by the frequency and intensity of freezing. Boix-Fayos et al. (1998), 
  for example, show that infiltration and water-holding capacity of soils on limestone 
  are greater with increased frost activity and infer that increased temperatures 
  could lead to increased surface or shallow runoff. Komescu et al. (1998) assess 
  the implications of climate change for soil moisture availability in southeast 
  Turkey, finding substantial reductions in availability during summer.</p>
<h3><a name="435"></a>4.3.5. Groundwater Recharge and Resources</h3>
<p>Groundwater is the major source of water across much of the world, particularly 
  in rural areas in arid and semi-arid regions, but there has been very little 
  research on the potential effects of climate change. This section therefore 
  can be regarded as presenting a series of hypotheses.</p>
<p>Aquifers generally are replenished by effective rainfall, rivers, and lakes. 
  This water may reach the aquifer rapidly, through macro-pores or fissures, or 
  more slowly by infiltrating through soils and permeable rocks overlying the 
  aquifer. A change in the amount of effective rainfall will alter recharge, but 
  so will a change in the duration of the recharge season. Increased winter rainfall&#151;as 
  projected under most scenarios for mid-latitudes&#151;generally is likely to 
  result in increased groundwater recharge. However, higher evaporation may mean 
  that soil deficits persist for longer and commence earlier, offsetting an increase 
  in total effective rainfall. Various types of aquifer will be recharged differently. 
  The main types are unconfined and confined aquifers. An unconfined aquifer is 
  recharged directly by local rainfall, rivers, and lakes, and the rate of recharge 
  will be influenced by the permeability of overlying rocks and soils. Some examples 
  of the effect of climate change on recharge into unconfined aquifers have been 
  described in France, Kenya, Tanzania, Texas, New York, and Caribbean islands. 
  Bouraoui et al. (1999) simulated substantial reductions in groundwater recharge 
  near Grenoble, France, almost entirely as a result of increases in evaporation 
  during the recharge season. Macro-pore and fissure recharge is most common in 
  porous and aggregated forest soils and less common in poorly structured soils. 
  It also occurs where the underlying geology is highly fractured or is characterized 
  by numerous sinkholes. Such recharge can be very important in some semi-arid 
  areas (e.g., the Wajir region of Kenya; Mailu, 1993). In principle, &#147;rapid&#148; 
  recharge can occur whenever it rains, so where recharge is dominated by this 
  process it will be affected more by changes in rainfall amount than by the seasonal 
  cycle of soil moisture variability. Sandstrom (1995) modeled recharge to an 
  aquifer in central Tanzania and showed that a 15% reduction in rainfall&#151;with 
  no change in temperature&#151;resulted in a 40&#150;50% reduction in recharge; 
  he infers that small changes in rainfall could lead to large changes in recharge 
  and hence groundwater resources. Loaiciga et al. (1998) explored the effect 
  of a range of climate change scenarios on groundwater levels in the Edwards 
  Balcones Fault Zone aquifer in Texas, a heavily exploited aquifer largely fed 
  by streamflow seepage. They show that, under six of the seven GCM-based scenarios 
  used, groundwater levels and springflows would reduce substantially as a result 
  of lower streamflow. However, they use 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios that represent changes 
  in temperature that are considerably greater than those projected even by the 
  2080s under current scenarios (Carter and Hulme, 1999), so the study considerably 
  overstates the effect of climate change in the next few decades.</p>
<p>Shallow unconfined aquifers along floodplains, which are most common in semi-arid 
  and arid environments, are recharged by seasonal streamflows and can be depleted 
  directly by evaporation. Changes in recharge therefore will be determined by 
  changes in the duration of flow of these streams&#151;which may locally increase 
  or decrease&#151;and the permeability of the overlying beds, but increased evaporative 
  demands would tend to lead to lower groundwater storage. In semi-arid areas 
  of Kenya, flood aquifers have been improved by construction of subsurface weirs 
  across the river valleys, forming subsurface dams from which water is tapped 
  by shallow wells. The thick layer of sands substantially reduces the impact 
  of evaporation. The wells have become perennial water supply sources even during 
  the prolonged droughts (Mailu, 1988, 1992).</p>
<p>Sea-level rise will cause saline intrusion into coastal aquifers, with the 
  amount of intrusion depending on local groundwater gradients. Shallow coastal 
  aquifers are at greatest risk (on Long Island, New York, for example). Groundwater 
  in low-lying islands therefore is very sensitive to change. In the atolls of 
  the Pacific Ocean, water supply is sensitive to precipitation patterns and changes 
  in storm tracks (Salinger et al., 1995). A reduction in precipitation coupled 
  with sea-level rise would not only cause a diminution of the harvestable volume 
  of water; it also would reduce the size of the narrow freshwater lense (Amadore 
  et al, 1996). For many small island states, such as some Caribbean islands, 
  seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers has been observed as a result of 
  overpumping of aquifers. Any sea-level rise would worsen the situation.</p>
<p>It will be noted from the foregoing that unconfined aquifers are sensitive 
  to local climate change, abstraction, and seawater intrusion. However, quantification 
  of recharge is complicated by the characteristics of the aquifers themselves 
  as well as overlying rocks and soils. </p>
<p>A confined aquifer, on the other hand, is characterized by an overlying bed 
  that is impermeable, and local rainfall does not influence the aquifer. It is 
  normally recharged from lakes, rivers, and rainfall that may occur at distances 
  ranging from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers. Recharge rates also 
  vary from a few days to decades. The Bahariya Oasis and other groundwater aquifers 
  in the Egyptian Desert, for example, are recharged at the Nubian Sandstone outcrops 
  in Sudan; such aquifers may not be seriously affected by seasonal or interannual 
  rainfall or temperature of the local area. </p>
<p>Attempts have been made to calculate the rate of recharge by using carbon-14 
  isotopes and other modeling techniques. This has been possible for aquifers 
  that are recharged from short distances and after short durations. However, 
  recharge that takes place from long distances and after decades or centuries 
  has been problematic to calculate with accuracy, making estimation of the impacts 
  of climate change difficult. The medium through which recharge takes place often 
  is poorly known and very heterogeneous, again challenging recharge modeling. 
  In general, there is a need to intensify research on modeling techniques, aquifer 
  characteristics, recharge rates, and seawater intrusion, as well as monitoring 
  of groundwater abstractions. This research will provide a sound basis for assessment 
  of the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on recharge and groundwater 
  resources.</p>
