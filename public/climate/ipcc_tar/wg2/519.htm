<h3>14.1.2. Climate Variability and Change </h3>
<p>There is ample evidence of climate variability at a wide range of time scales 
  all over Latin America, from intraseasonal to long term. In many subregions 
  of Latin America, this variability in climate normally is associated with phenomena 
  that already produce impacts with important socioeconomic and environmental 
  consequences that could be exacerbated by global warming and associated climate 
  change. Signals that can be related to variability and/or change in climate 
  conditions for Latin America have been identified in some of the analyses performed 
  by researchers in the region, particularly for streamflow, precipitation, temperature, 
  glacier oscillations, general circulation, and extreme events. Estimations of 
  potential future climate conditions are based on climate change scenarios studies 
  developed for some subregions of Latin America.</p>
<h4><a name="14121"></a>14.1.2.1. Past to Present </h4>
<h4><a name="141211"></a>14.1.2.1.1. Glaciers, precipitation, and streamflow</h4>
<p>Glaciers in Latin America have receded dramatically in the past decades, and 
  many of them have disappeared completely (Williams and Ferrigno, 1998). In 18 
  glaciers in the Peruvian Andes, mass balances since 1968 and satellite images 
  show a reduction of more than 20% of the glacial surface, corresponding to 11,300 
  million m<sup>3</sup> of ice (Morales-Arnao, 1969a,b; INAGGA-CONAM, 1999). Significant 
  reductions also have occurred in southern Chile and Argentina (e.g., glacier 
  Sarmiento) (Basso, 1997). Deglaciation may have contributed to observed negative 
  trends in streamflows in that region (Morales-Arnao, 1999). For rivers in arid 
  lands in northwest Peru and northeast and southeastern Brazil, significant negative 
  trends also have been detected, but these variations seem to be related to human 
  water management for irrigation purposes and increases in agricultural areas, 
  rather than climate-induced changes (INRENA, 1994; Marengo, 1995; Marengo <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Between 20&deg;S and 40&deg;S, precipitation around the Andes occurs mainly 
  during the winter. Snow accumulates in the high parts of the cordillera and 
  melts during the summer, becoming the main source of water for rivers in the 
  region. Agricultural activities in central Chile and the Argentinean central 
  western plains are maintained through irrigation. Therefore, it may be said 
  with high confidence that fluctuations in winter precipitation have a strong 
  socioeconomic impact in the region. </p>
<p>The precipitation record for Santiago, Chile, is highly correlated with snow 
  depth in the cordillera. Recorded precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend 
  from the late 19th century through the mid-1970s but has reverted since then. 
  A similar trend has been detected in streamflow in the region (Minetti and Sierra, 
  1989; Carril <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Compagnucci and Vargas, 1998; Compagnucci 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Waylen <i>et al</i>., 2000). In southern Chile and the 
  Argentinean cordillera, a negative trend in precipitation and streamflow has 
  been detected (Quintela <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Nu&ntilde;ez <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>In northwestern Mexico, there is a tendency for more winter precipitation, 
  which has resulted in positive trends in river water levels. However, along 
  with more intense winter precipitation, interannual climate variability has 
  increased (Maga&ntilde;a and Conde, 2000). On the other hand, some parts of 
  southern Mexico and Central America exhibit positive or negative rainfall trends, 
  depending on the orientation of the catchment (Aparicio, 1993; IPCC, 1996; J&aacute;uregui, 
  1997; <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapter 3</a>). </p>
<p>For Nicaragua, rainfall analysis for 1961-1995 showed negative trends 
  in the north and northwest parts of the country. A systematic increment was 
  detected on the Caribbean coast, and almost no variation was found along the 
  central and the Pacific coastal regions (MARENA, 2000).</p>
<p>In Colombia, weak rainfall trends have been observed for the period 1955-1995, 
  with no preferred sign at a regional level. For central Colombia, rainy seasons 
  have been occurring earlier in recent years than 25 years ago (Mesa <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). Trends in Colombian river streamflow are mixed, but the main river catchments 
  such as the Cauca and Magdalena Rivers exhibit decreasing trends. Deforestation 
  could account for such decreasing trends in river discharges (Poveda and Mesa, 
  1997).</p>
<p>For the Amazon region, Marengo<i> et al.</i> (2000) have identified multidecadal 
  variations in rainfall in northern and southern portions of the basin, with 
  opposite tendencies. Perhaps the most important finding is the presence of periods 
  with relatively wetter or drier conditions that are more relevant than any unidirectional 
  trends themselves. For instance, the period 1950-1976 was regionally wet 
  in northern Amazonia, but since 1977 the region has been drier. This dryness 
  does not seem to be related to regional deforestation (see Marengo <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Marengo and Nobre, 2000; <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>). Similarly, streamflow series in Amazonian rivers also exhibit multidecadal 
  variations; they do not display significant unidirectional trends (Richey <i>et 
  al</i>., 1989; Marengo, 1995). </p>
<p>In northeast Brazil, multidecadal variations in atmospheric circulation over 
  the tropical Atlantic have been linked to similar time-scale variations in rainfall 
  over the region (Hastenrath and Greischar, 1993; Nobre and Shukla, 1996; Wagner, 
  1996). On longer time scales, rainfall in northern northeast Brazil exhibits 
  weak positive trends that are consistent with changes in decadal changes in 
  circulation described in Wagner (1996).</p>
<p>Streamflow in the River Plate basin&#151;particularly in the Negro, Paraguay, 
  Paran&aacute;, and Uruguay Rivers&#151;exhibits a negative trend from 1901 to 
  1970, which reverses after this period. Multidecadal variability also is observed 
  in discharges (Garcia and Vargas, 1998; Genta <i>et al</i>., 1998; Robertson 
  and Mechoso, 1998). Moreover, there are written reports of alternating floods 
  and droughts periods during the 16th-18th centuries, indicating high natural 
  variability (Prieto and Herrera, 1992).</p>
<p>In subtropical Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, precipitation exhibits a long-term 
  change, with a sharp increase in the period 1956-1990 after a dry period 
  along 1921-1955 (Casta&ntilde;eda and Barros, 1996). In the Pampa region, 
  there is a positive trend in precipitation during the period 1890-1984. 
  This increase in annual rainfalls was accompanied by a relative increase in 
  precipitation during the spring and summer (Penalba and Vargas, 1996; Hoffman 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Krepper and Sequeira, 1998). At high elevations in northwest 
  Argentina, paleoclimatic records suggest an increase in precipitation in the 
  past 200 years (Villalba <i>et al.</i>, 1997). In the same region, as well as 
  in Bolivia and southeast Peru, records show that the 17th-century climate was 
  wetter and less variable (fewer floods and droughts ), whereas the 18th century 
  was highly unstable, with a large amplitude in the annual cycle and recurrent 
  wet and dry periods (Prieto and Herrera, 1992). </p>
<p>Variations in precipitation in Latin America have a strong effect on runoff 
  and streamflow, which also are affected by melting of glaciers and snow. Based 
  on available information, there is evidence that these variations and their 
  sign depend on the geographical subregion under consideration.</p>
