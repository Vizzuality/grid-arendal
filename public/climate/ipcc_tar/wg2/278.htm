<h3>5.9.2. Responses of Arctic and Alpine Ecosystems and Impacts on their Goods 
  and Services </h3>
<h4><a name="5921"></a>5.9.2.1. Impacts Resulting from Changes in Climate on Arctic 
  Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Changes in climate are likely to be the greatest cause of changes in goods 
  and services in the arctic (Walker et al., 2001). Projected climatic warming 
  of 4-10&deg;C by the end of the century probably would cause substantial 
  increases in decomposition, nutrient release, and primary production. The net 
  effect on the carbon balance will depend primarily on soil moisture (McKane 
  et al., 1997; McGuire et al., 2000), which cannot be projected with confidence. 
  In general, surface soils on slopes are expected to become drier as thaw depth 
  increases. Lowlands may experience substantial thermokarst, impoundment of water, 
  and reduced aeration. </p>
<p>Plant production frequently is limited in the arctic by excessive moisture 
  and slow turnover of nutrients in soils, and warming and drying of soils is 
  likely to enhance decomposition, nutrient mineralization, and productivity. 
  Many of these changes in productivity may be mediated by changes in species 
  composition and therefore are likely to lag changes in climate by years to decades 
  (Chapin et al., 1995; Shaver et al., 2000). Threshold changes in productivity 
  associated with poleward movement of the treeline is likely to experience time 
  lags of decades to centuries because of limitations in dispersal and establishment 
  of trees (Starfield and Chapin, 1996; Chapin and Starfield, 1997).</p>
<p>The net effect of warming on carbon stores in high-latitude ecosystems depends 
  on changes in the balance between production and decomposition. Decomposition 
  initially may respond more rapidly than production, causing trends toward net 
  carbon efflux (Shaver et al., 1992; Smith and Shugart 1993). </p>
<p>Warming-induced thermokarst is likely to increase CH<sub>4</sub> flux to the 
  atmosphere in lowlands, particularly peatlands of northern Canada and western 
  Siberia (Gorham, 1991; Roulet and Ash, 1992; see also <a href="267.htm">Section 
  5.8</a>) and the loess-dominated "yedoma" sediments of central and eastern Siberia 
  (Zimov et al., 1997). Fires and other disturbances are likely to affect the 
  thermokarsts; however, the role of these disturbances&#151;which can be mediated 
  with changes in regional climate in inducing thermokarst&#151;are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Changes in community composition associated with warming are likely to alter 
  feedbacks to climate. Tundra has a three- to six-fold higher winter albedo than 
  boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly 
  among ecosystems within tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes 
  (Betts and Ball, 1997; Eugster et al., 2000). If regional surface warming continues, 
  changes in albedo and energy absorption during winter are likely to act as positive 
  feedbacks to regional warming as a result of earlier melting of snow and, over 
  the long term, poleward movement of the treeline. Surface drying and a change 
  in dominance from mosses to vascular plants also would enhance sensible heat 
  flux and regional warming in tundra (Lynch et al., 1999; Chapin et al., 2000). 
</p>
<p>Poleward migration of taxa from boreal forest to the Arctic tundra will depend 
  not only on warming climate but also on dispersal rates, colonization rates, 
  and species interactions and therefore may exhibit substantial time lags. The 
  arctic historically has experienced fewer invasions of weeds and other exotic 
  taxa than other regions (Billings, 1973). Some of the most important changes 
  in diversity in the arctic may be changes in the abundance of caribou, waterfowl, 
  and other subsistence resources (see also <a href="218.htm">Section 5.4</a>). 
  Changes in community composition and productivity may be particularly pronounced 
  in the high arctic, where much of the surface currently is unvegetated and is 
  prone to establishment and expansion of additional vegetation (Wookey et al., 
  1993; Callaghan and Jonasson, 1995).</p>
