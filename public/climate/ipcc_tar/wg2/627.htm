<h3><a name="1723"></a>17.2.3. Beach and Coastal Changes</h3>
<p>The morphology, characteristics, and classification of beaches are influenced 
  by a variety of factors, including island origin, geologic structure and composition 
  (e.g., volcanic, coral atoll, raised atoll, reef island, or emergent limestone), 
  age, elevation, and size (Gillie, 1997; Solomon and Forbes, 1999). Thus, given 
  their varied origins, a wide range of beach types and characteristics is represented 
  in the small island states of the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas and the Atlantic, 
  Pacific, and Indian Oceans. </p>
<p>Coastal erosion&#151;partly the result of anthropogenic factors such as sand 
  mining (Gillie, 1997; Ragoonaden, 1997)&#151; already is a problem on many islands 
  and evidently may be exacerbated by sea-level rise (Mimura and Nunn, 1998). 
  On many atolls (as in the Pacific) and low reef islands (as in the Caribbean), 
  carbonate beaches are maintained by sand produced from productive reefs whose 
  degradation already is causing accelerated beach erosion. Similarly, in the 
  Mediterranean Sea, where the islands are periodically susceptible to flooding 
  and scour from storm surges, an increase in storminess would further stress 
  natural and human systems located at the coast (Nicholls and Hoozemans, 1996). 
  The impact of the equivalent of a 1-m rise in sea level for a cumulative few 
  hours on the coast was observed in Singapore on 7-14 February 1974. The event 
  indicates clearly the vulnerability of the island's low-lying area to flooding 
  and coastal erosion if sea-level rise takes place (Wong, 1992). </p>
<p>Beach erosion rates of approximately 2-4 m yr<sup>-1</sup>, on average, 
  have been reported for several beaches in Trinidad and Tobago, where mean relative 
  sea-level rise of 8-10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> has been recorded by two gauges 
  during the past 15 years. Although beach erosion results from multiple forces, 
  sea-level rise is considered a contributory factor (Singh, 1997a,b). Ragoonaden 
  (1997) measured shoreline retreat of 2.7 m yr<sup>-1</sup> at Flic-en-Flac (Mauritius), 
  and Nunn and Mimura (1997) report that the coasts of some islands in Fiji have 
  retreated by more than 30 m in the past 70 years. In the specific case of Viti 
  Levu and Taveuni, Fiji, beach erosion has been attributed to a combination of 
  human-induced causes (including loss of the mangrove fringe and other natural 
  protection) and elevated sea level, which has been rising at a rate of approximately 
  1-1.5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> since 1960 (Forbes and Solomon, 1997; Nunn and 
  Mimura, 1997).</p>
<h4><a name="17231"></a>17.2.3.1. Response, Adaptation, and Management</h4>
<p>It is now widely accepted that strategies for adaptation to sea-level rise 
  tend to fall into three main categories: retreat, accommodate, and protect (Bijlsma, 
  1996; IPCC, 1996, 1998). Hard engineering&#151;involving the construction of 
  groynes, seawalls, breakwaters, and bulkheads&#151;has long been the traditional 
  response to coastal erosion and flooding in many small island states. Unfortunately, 
  this approach has not always been efficiently implemented and has even helped 
  to increase coastal vulnerability in some cases (Mimura and Nunn, 1998; Solomon 
  and Forbes, 1999). In these specific circumstances, the term "maladaptation" 
  (which refers to a response that does not succeed in reducing vulnerability 
  but increases it instead; see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>) may be applied. 
  Realistically, however, for some islands the application of hard solutions may 
  be the only practical option along well-developed coasts, where vital infrastructure 
  is at immediate risk. </p>
<p>There are other potential options available to small island states, including 
  enhancement and preservation of natural protection (e.g., replanting of mangroves 
  and protection of coral reefs), use of softer options such as artificial nourishment, 
  and raising the height of the ground of coastal villages (Nunn and Mimura, 1997). 
  Raising the height of the ground requires additional aggregate such as sand 
  and stone and a lot of pumping, in which many small islands are seriously deficient. 
  Removal of materials from "unimportant" islands to build up important 
  islands via sand transfer by pipes and barges has been suggested by the IPCC 
  (1990). Some island states may be faced with few practical options. Thus, it 
  might be necessary for them to lose some islands so that the entire nation is 
  not completely inundated (Nicholls and Mimura, 1998).</p>
<p>Similarly, beach nourishment may not be a practical or economical option for 
  many island nations because sand often is a scarce resource (Leatherman, 1997; 
  IPCC, 1998). Moreover, beach nourishment requires maintenance in the form of 
  periodic sand replenishment, sometimes every 5-10 years or less (Amadore 
  <i>et al., </i>1996). Such a requirement could prove to be unsustainable in 
  small economies. In contrast, on some islands such as Singapore, where the technology 
  and resources are more readily available, beach fill projects (used in combination 
  with offshore breakwaters to form artificial headlands) is a feasible option 
  (Wong, 1985). As a general strategy to respond to sea-level rise, it is likely 
  that Singapore will focus on three main types of responses: coastal protection 
  for developed or heavily populated areas and reclaimed land, anti-salt-intrusion 
  measures for coastal reservoirs, and flood prevention measures (such as tidal 
  gates) for major canals (Wong 1992).</p>
<p>In some islands, such as those in the Caribbean, more emphasis is being placed 
  on the application of "precautionary" approaches, such as enforcement 
  of building set-backs, land-use regulations, building codes, and insurance coverage. 
  In addition, application of traditional, appropriate responses (e.g., building 
  on stilts and use of expendable, readily available indigenous building materials), 
  which have proven to be effective responses in many islands in the past, ought 
  to be more widely considered (Forbes and Solomon, 1997; Mimura and Nunn, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Given the vulnerability of many small island states to various aspects of global 
  change, integrated coastal management (ICM) is rapidly becoming an attractive 
  paradigm for planning adaptation (Bijlsma, 1996; Cicin-Sain, 1998; Nicholls 
  and Mimura, 1998). Furthermore, ICM can be regarded as both an anticipatory 
  and a predictive tool, with the capability to plan for and respond to medium- 
  and long-term concerns such as sea-level rise as well as short-term, present-day 
  needs (Nurse, 1999; Solomon and Forbes, 1999). In addition, ICM can provide 
  an effective framework for resolving potential conflict among competing stakeholder 
  interests, in a manner that is equitable to all groups. In this context, it 
  is noteworthy that all of the small island states that recently participated 
  in the U.S. Country Studies Program (i.e., Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, 
  Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius) concluded that ICM 
  was the most appropriate adaptation strategy and should form an essential part 
  of their climate change national action plans (Huang, 1997).</p>
<p>Enhancing the resilience of coastal systems has been suggested (e.g., Bijlsma, 
  1996) as an appropriate proactive adaptive response to reduce vulnerability. 
  Klein and Nicholls (1998) agree that this could be a more cost-effective way 
  to prepare for uncertain changes such as sea-level rise, rather than relying 
  entirely on building traditional, more costly coastal defenses. Helmer <i>et 
  al.</i> (1996) strongly support the notion of enhancement of coastal resilience 
  whereby dynamic systems (e.g., dunes, lagoons, and estuaries) should be allowed 
  to utilize their natural capacity to grow in response to rising sea levels. 
  This philosophy could be applied through pilot studies in small islands. One 
  of the ways in which a dynamic and resilient coast can be created is by managed 
  retreat, based on an enforced building set-back that allows the coastline to 
  recede to a new line of defense, thus restoring natural coastal processes and 
  systems. An orderly plan to retreat could be a feasible option on larger islands 
  that cannot commit the resources necessary to prevent coastal land loss in the 
  face of rising sea levels (Leatherman, 1997).</p>
<p>One recommended approach to planning adaptation to sea-level rise and coastal 
  change involves an estimation of the costs of protecting or abandoning developed 
  properties. For developed coasts, West and Dowlatabadi (1999) propose that the 
  real economic evaluation of sea-level rise should be regarded as the difference 
  in utility (not just damages) with and without a sea-level rise scenario, in 
  which it is assumed that physical conditions (e.g., erosion and storms) and 
  human behavior remain constant. This is an improvement on past approaches, which 
  provided the estimated costs of sea-level rise on the basis of market value 
  of inundated land and property or the cost of structural protection.</p>
