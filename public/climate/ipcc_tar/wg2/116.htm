<h4>2.7.2.3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h4>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) takes a predetermined objective (often an 
  outcome negotiated by key stakeholder groups in a society) and seeks ways to 
  accomplish it as inexpensively as possible. The thorny issues of compensations 
  and actual transfers boil down to less complex but still contentious issues 
  of burden sharing.</p>
<p>CBA will always be controversial because of the intricacies of valuing benefits 
  of many public policies, especially intangible benefits of environmental policies, 
  properly. CEA takes the desired level of a public good as externally given (a 
  vertical marginal benefit curve) and minimizes costs across a range of possible 
  actions. Like other target-based approaches, CEA often turns into an implicit 
  CBA, especially if even the minimum costs turn out to be too high and beyond 
  the ability to pay of the society. In this case, the target is iteratively revised 
  until an acceptable solution is found.</p>
<p>Consider the foregoing example of changing precipitation pattern induced by 
  climate change and resulting high-water conditions. In many countries, legally 
  binding criteria exist regarding the level of flood protection (e.g., protection 
  against a 50- or 100-year return flood). CEA would take these or other socially 
  agreed flood protection targets and seek the mix of dams, reservoirs, and other 
  river basin management options that would minimize the costs of achieving the 
  specified target.</p>
<h4><a name="2724"></a>2.7.2.4. Policy Exercise Approach</h4>
<p>The policy exercise (PE) approach involves a flexibly structured process that 
  is designed as an interface between academics and policymakers. Its function 
  is to synthesize and assess knowledge accumulated in several relevant fields 
  of science for policy purposes in light of complex practical management problems. 
  At the heart of the process are scenario writing ("future histories," 
  emphasizing nonconventional, surprise-rich, but still plausible futures) and 
  scenario analyses via interactive formulation and testing of alternative policies 
  that respond to challenges in the scenario. These scenario-based activities 
  take place in an organizational setting that reflects the institutional features 
  of the issues addressed. Throughout the exercise, a wide variety of hard (mathematical 
  and computer models) and soft methods are used (Brewer, 1986; Toth, 1988a,b; 
  Parson, 1997).</p>
<p>The product of a PE is not necessarily new scientific knowledge or a series 
  of explicit policy recommendations but a new, better structured view of the 
  problem in the minds of participants. The exercise also produces statements 
  concerning priorities for research to fill gaps of knowledge, institutional 
  changes that are needed to cope more effectively with the problems, technological 
  initiatives that are necessary, and monitoring and early warning systems that 
  could ease some of the problems in the future. In recent years we have witnessed 
  increasing use of the PE approach to address climate change at the national 
  scale (see Klabbers <i>et al</i>., 1995, 1996) and at the global level.</p>
