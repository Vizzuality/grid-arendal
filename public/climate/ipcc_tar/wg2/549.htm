<h4>Public and Private Insurance and Disaster Relief Systems</h4>
<p>Inflation-corrected, weather-driven losses have been increasing in North America 
  over the past 3 decades (high confidence). Both exposure and financial surplus 
  of private insurers (especially property insurers) and reinsurers have been 
  growing, and weather-related profit declines and insolvencies have been observed. 
  Insured weather-related losses in North America (59% of the global total) are 
  increasing with affluence and as populations continue to move into vulnerable 
  areas. Insurer vulnerability to these changes varies considerably by region. 
  Insurers are adversely affected by increased variability or actuarial uncertainty 
  of weather-related events. Governments play a key role as insurers and/or providers 
  of disaster relief, especially in cases in which risks are deemed to be uninsurable 
  by the private sector.</p>
<p>Canada and the United States have different loss profiles (high confidence). 
  In both countries, the nature of weather-related exposures and losses is diverse, 
  ranging from property damages to business interruptions caused by electric power 
  or communication system damage (as in the 1998 ice storm).</p>
<p>U.S. government insurance programs for crops and floods have not been profitable 
  and in some cases have encouraged more human activity in at-risk areas. In the 
  absence of similar programs in Canada, government disaster relief programs have 
  paid roughly 86% of flood losses over the past 2 decades. There remains an important 
  tension between the allocation of such risks between private insurers and the 
  public sector, and the effects of climate changes (e.g., coastal erosion) would 
  increasingly stress government programs.<br>
</p>
<p>Recent extreme events have led to several responses by insurers, including 
  increased attention to building codes and disaster preparedness, limiting insurance 
  availability or increasing prices, and establishment of new risk-spreading mechanisms. 
  Insurers can play an important role in climate adaptation and mitigation. However, 
  because their actuarial outlook is based on past climatic experience and forward-looking 
  modeling studies are just now beginning to be used, the potential for surprise 
  is real.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="13"></a>Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability </h4>
<p>Case studies for various North American subregions and border regions illustrate 
  how the changing nature of climate-society relationships is influencing the 
  nature of vulnerability, climate-related impacts, and adaptive responses. These 
  cases include observed extreme events and potential responses to climate change 
  scenarios. Increased levels of development may reduce vulnerability in some 
  cases (e.g., agriculture) and increase or change vulnerability in others (e.g., 
  Columbia basin water management).<br>
</p>
<p>The nature of observed damages reflects the increasing demands that society 
  is placing on natural resources and systems that are sensitive to extreme events, 
  as climate change is superimposed on complex environmental problems (e.g., coastal 
  eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico). <br>
</p>
<p>Climate-related consequences for water, health, food, energy, insurance, governments, 
  and human settlements are likely to require substantial institutional and infrastructure 
  changes in some cases. The short period of time required to make infrastructure 
  adjustments is likely to require new institutions to cope with rapid and sweeping 
  change. The example of new "water markets" in the western United States 
  illustrates an adaptive measure that also may lead to concerns about accessibility 
  of this essential commodity for lower income people, as well as conflicts about 
  social priorities in its allocation (e.g., farms vs. residential use).<br>
</p>
<p>Determining responses to scenarios is a long process that requires dialogue 
  with stakeholders. They understand the goals, objectives, and constraints driving 
  the development, management, and operation of resource production and maintenance 
  systems. This interdisciplinary and intercultural dialogue has the potential 
  for improving sharing of information and enhancing its use in decisionmaking 
  at various scales.</p>
