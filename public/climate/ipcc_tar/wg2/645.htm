<h3>18.2.4. Systems, Scales, and Actors</h3>
<p>Adaptations occur in something (i.e., who or what adapts?), which is called 
  the "system of interest," "unit of analysis," "exposure 
  unit," "activity of interest," or "sensitive system" 
  (Carter <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Smithers and Smit, 1997; UNEP, 1998; Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 
  2000). In <i>unmanaged natural systems</i>, adaptation is autonomous and reactive 
  and is the means by which species and communities respond to changed conditions. 
  In these situations, adaptation assessment is essentially equivalent to natural 
  system impact assessment (addressed in other WGII chapters). This chapter focuses 
  on adaptations consciously undertaken by <i>humans</i>, including those in economic 
  sectors, settlements, communities, regions, and managed ecosystems.</p>
<p>Human system adaptation can be motivated by private or public interest (i.e., 
  who adapts?). <i>Private</i> decisionmakers include individuals, households, 
  businesses, and corporations; <i>public</i> interests are served by governments 
  at all levels. The roles of public and private participants are distinct but 
  not unrelated. <a href="#fig185">Figure 18-5</a> shows examples of types of adaptation differentiated 
  according to timing, natural or human systems, and public or private decisionmakers.</p>

<p>Planned adaptation often is interpreted as the result of a deliberate policy 
  decision on the part of a public agency, based on an awareness that conditions 
  are about to change or have changed and that action is required to minimize 
  losses or benefit from opportunities (Pittock and Jones, 2000). Autonomous adaptations 
  are widely interpreted as initiatives by private actors rather than by governments, 
  usually triggered by market or welfare changes induced by actual or anticipated 
  climate change (Leary, 1999). Smith <i>et al.</i> (1996) describe autonomous adaptations 
  as those that occur "naturally," without interventions by public agencies, 
  whereas planned adaptations are called "intervention strategies." 
  Thus defined, autonomous and planned adaptation largely correspond with private 
  and public adaptation, respectively (see <a href="#fig185">Figure 18-5</a>).</p>
<p>The extent to which society can rely on autonomous, private, or market adaptation 
  to reduce the costs of climate change impacts to an acceptable or nondangerous 
  level is an issue of great interest. Autonomous adaptation forms a baseline 
  against which the need for planned anticipatory adaptation can be evaluated. 
  <br>
  Distinguishing among the various decisionmakers involved in adaptation is important. 
  The case of African agriculture and water resources illustrates that stakeholders 
  and potential adapters range from vulnerable consumers to international organizations 
  charged with relief and research (Eele, 1996; Magadza, 1996; Downing <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997). Poor and landless households have limited resources, yet failure to adapt 
  can lead to significant deprivation, displacement, morbidity, and mortality. 
  Subsistence farmers do not have the same adaptation options as commercial producers. 
  Water supply adaptations may involve landowners, private traders, local authorities, 
  water-dependent businesses, national governments, and international organizations. 
  Each stakeholder has distinct interests, information, risks, and resources and 
  hence would consider distinct types of adaptive responses (Downing <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<a name="1825"></a>
<h3>18.2.5. Processes and Evaluation of Adaptations</h3>
<p>In order to predict autonomous adaptations and provide input to adaptation 
  policies, there is a need for improved knowledge about processes involved in 
  adaptation decisions. This knowledge includes information on steps in the process, 
  decision rationales, handling of uncertainties, choices of adaptation types 
  and timing, conditions that stimulate or dampen adaptation, and the consequences 
  or performance of adaptation strategies or measures (Burton, 1997; Rayner and 
  Malone, 1998; Tol <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Basher, 1999; Klein <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Pittock, 1999; 
  Smit <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Decisions regarding adaptations can be undertaken at any of several scales, 
  by private individuals, local communities or institutions, national governments, 
  and international organizations. Where these adaptations are consciously planned 
  activities, whether by public agencies or individuals, there is an interest 
  in assessing the performance or relative merits of alternative measures and 
  strategies (see <a href="644.htm#fig184">Figure 18-4</a>). This <i>evaluation</i> 
  (i.e., how good is the adaptation?) can be based on criteria such as costs, 
  benefits, equity, efficiency, and implementability (see <a href="647.htm#1835">Sections 
  18.3.5</a> and <a href="649.htm#1843">18.4.3</a>).</p>
