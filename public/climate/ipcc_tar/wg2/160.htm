<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p> There are apparent trends in streamflow volume&#151;both increases and decreases&#151;in 
  many regions. These trends cannot all be definitively attributed to changes 
  in regional temperature or precipitation. However, widespread accelerated glacier 
  retreat and shifts in streamflow timing in many areas from spring to winter 
  are more likely to be associated with climate change.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> The effect of climate change on streamflow and groundwater 
      recharge varies regionally and between scenarios, largely following projected 
      changes in precipitation. In some parts of the world, the direction of change 
      is consistent between scenarios, although the magnitude is not. In other 
      parts of the world, the direction of change is uncertain. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">Peak streamflow is likely to move from spring to winter 
      in many areas where snowfall currently is an important component of the 
      water balance. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">Glacier retreat is likely to continue, and many small glaciers 
      may disappear. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> Water quality is likely generally to be degraded by higher 
      water temperature, but this may be offset regionally by increased flows. 
      Lower flows will enhance degradation of water quality. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">Flood magnitude and frequency are likely to increase in 
      most regions, and low flows are likely to decrease in many regions. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">Demand for water generally is increasing as a result of 
      population growth and economic development, but it is falling in some countries. 
      Climate change is unlikely to have a large effect on municipal and industrial 
      demands but may substantially affect irrigation withdrawals. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">The impact of climate change on water resources depends 
      not only on changes in the volume, timing, and quality of streamflow and 
      recharge but also on system characteristics, changing pressures on the system, 
      how the management of the system evolves, and what adaptations to climate 
      change are implemented. Nonclimatic changes may have a greater impact on 
      water resources than climate change.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> Unmanaged systems are likely to be most vulnerable to climate 
      change. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> Climate change challenges existing water resources management 
      practices by adding additional uncertainty. Integrated water resources management 
      will enhance the potential for adaptation to change. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">Adaptive capacity (specifically, the ability to implement 
      integrated water resources management), however, is distributed very unevenly 
      across the world.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
