<h2><a name="43"></a>4.3. Effects on the Hydrological Cycle</h2>
<h3><a name="431"></a>4.3.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>This section summarizes the potential effects of climate change on the components 
  of the water balance and their variability over time.</p>
<h3><a name="432"></a>4.3.2. Precipitation</h3>
<p>Precipitation is the main driver of variability in the water balance over space 
  and time, and changes in precipitation have very important implications for 
  hydrology and water resources. Hydrological variability over time in a catchment 
  is influenced by variations in precipitation over daily, seasonal, annual, and 
  decadal time scales. Flood frequency is affected by changes in the year-to-year 
  variability in precipitation and by changes in short-term rainfall properties 
  (such as storm rainfall intensity). The frequency of low or drought flows is 
  affected primarily by changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation, 
  year-to-year variability, and the occurrence of prolonged droughts.</p>
<p><a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/076.htm">Section 2.5</a> summarizes 
  studies into trends in precipitation. There are different trends in different 
  parts of the world, with a general increase in Northern Hemisphere mid- and 
  high latitudes (particularly in autumn and winter) and a decrease in the tropics 
  and subtropics in both hemispheres. There is evidence that the frequency of 
  extreme rainfall has increased in the United States (Karl and Knight, 1998) 
  and in the UK (Osborn et al., 2000); in both countries, a greater proportion 
  of precipitation is falling in large events than in earlier decades.</p>
<p>Current climate models simulate a climate change-induced increase in annual 
  precipitation in high and mid-latitudes and most equatorial regions but a general 
  decrease in the subtropics (Carter and Hulme, 1999), although across large parts 
  of the world the changes associated with global warming are small compared to 
  those resulting from natural multi-decadal variability, even by the 2080s. Changes 
  in seasonal precipitation are even more spatially variable and depend on changes 
  in the climatology of a region. In general, the largest percentage precipitation 
  changes over land are found in high latitudes, some equatorial regions, and 
  southeast Asia, although there are large differences between climate models.</p>
<p>Until recently, very few projections of possible changes in year-to-year variability 
  as simulated by climate models have been published, reflecting both the (until 
  recently) short model runs available and the recognition that climate models 
  do not necessarily reproduce observed patterns of climatic variability. Recent 
  developments, however, include the increasing ability of some global climate 
  models to reproduce features such as El Ni&ntilde;o (e.g., Meehl and Washington, 
  1996) and open up the possibility that it may be feasible to estimate changes 
  in year-to-year variability. Recent scenarios for the UK, derived from HadCM2 
  experiments, indicate an increase in the relative variability of seasonal and 
  annual rainfall totals resulting from global warming (Hulme and Jenkins, 1998).</p>
<p>Potential changes in intense rainfall frequency are difficult to infer from 
  global climate models, largely because of coarse spatial resolution. However, 
  there are indications (e.g., Hennessy et al., 1997; McGuffie et al., 1999) that 
  the frequency of heavy rainfall events generally is likely to increase with 
  global warming. Confidence in this assertion depends on the confidence with 
  which global climate models are held. More generally, uncertainty in GCM projections 
  of precipitation largely determines the uncertainty in estimated impacts on 
  hydrological systems and water resources.</p>
<p>Increasing temperatures mean that a smaller proportion of precipitation may 
  fall as snow. In areas where snowfall currently is marginal, snow may cease 
  to occur&#151;with consequent, very significant, implications (discussed below) 
  for hydrological regimes. This projection is considerably less uncertain than 
  possible changes in the magnitude of precipitation.</p>
