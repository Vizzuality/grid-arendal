<h2>3.5. Climate Scenarios </h2>
<h3><a name="351"></a>3.5.1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this section is to provide a summary of major methodological 
  issues in the science of climate scenario development and to relate these developments 
  to applications of scenarios in this report. We distinguish between a climate 
  scenario, which refers to a plausible future climate, and a climate change scenario, 
  which implies the difference between some plausible future climate and the present-day 
  climate, though the terms are used interchangeably in the scientific literature. 
  This brief overview is distilled largely from material presented in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/474.htm">Chapter 13</a>. See that chapter, as well as <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/308.htm">Chapters 8</a>, <a href="../wg1/338.htm">9</a>, and <a href="../wg1/373.htm">10</a>, 
  for more complete coverage of this subject. </p>
<h3><a name="352"></a>3.5.2. Methods</h3>
<p>Methods of climate scenario development largely have been ignored in earlier 
  IPCC assessments, although some aspects of scenario development have been alluded 
  to (e.g., palaeoclimatic analogs in Folland <i>et al</i>., 1990; downscaling 
  methods in Kattenburg <i>et al</i>., 1996). <a href="140.htm#tab34">Table 3-4</a> 
  provides an overview of the main methods, which also are discussed in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/474.htm">Chapter 13</a>. Thus, we present only a very brief 
  summary of three major methods. A fourth method, expert judgement, that also 
  has been used in developing climate scenarios (NDU, 1978; Morgan and Keith, 
  1995), is discussed further in <a href="147.htm">Section 3.5.5</a>. </p>
<h4><a name="3521"></a>3.5.2.1. Incremental Scenarios for Sensitivity Studies</h4>
<p>In this approach, particular climatic (or related) elements are changed by 
  realistic but arbitrary amounts. They are commonly applied to study the sensitivity 
  of an exposure unit to a wide range of variations in climate and to construct 
  impact response surfaces over multivariate climate space. Most studies have 
  adopted incremental scenarios of constant changes throughout the year (e.g., 
  Terjung <i>et al</i>., 1984; Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 1996), but some have 
  introduced seasonal and spatial variations in the changes (e.g., Rosenthal <i>et 
  al</i>., 1995); others have examined arbitrary changes in interannual, within-month, 
  and diurnal variability, as well as changes in the mean (e.g., Williams <i>et 
  al</i>., 1988; Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1992, 1996; Semenov and Porter, 1995). 
  Some of these studies are discussed in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3522"></a>3.5.2.2. Analog Approaches</h4>
<p>Temporal and spatial analogs also have been used in constructing climate scenarios. 
  Temporal analogs make use of climatic information from the past as an analog 
  of possible future climate (Pittock, 1993). They are of two types: palaeoclimatic 
  analogs and instrumentally based analogs.</p>
<p><i>Palaeoclimatic analogs</i>: Palaeoclimatic analogs are based on reconstructions 
  of past climate from fossil evidence, such as plant or animal remains and sedimentary 
  deposits. Two periods have received particular attention: the mid-Holocene (~5-6 
  ky BP<sup><small>3</small></sup>), when northern hemisphere temperatures are 
  estimated to have been about 1&deg;C warmer than today, and the Last (Eemian) 
  Interglacial (~120-130 ky BP), when temperatures were about 2&deg;C warmer.<br>
  <br>
  The major disadvantages of this method are the causal differences between past 
  changes in climate and posited future changes (Crowley, 1990; Mitchell, 1990) 
  and the large uncertainties about the quality of palaeoclimatic reconstructions 
  (Covey, 1995; Kneshgi and Lapenis, 1996; Borzenkova, 1998). However, these scenarios 
  continue to be used occasionally in impact assessments (Anisimov and Nelson, 
  1996; Budyko and Menzhulin, 1996) and are useful for providing insights about 
  system vulnerability to climate change. </p>
<p><i>Instrumentally based analogs</i>: Periods of observed regional or global-scale 
  warmth during the historical period also have been used as an analog of a GHG-induced 
  warmer world. Scenarios are constructed by estimating the difference between 
  the regional climate during the warm period and that of the long-term average 
  or that of a similarly selected cold period (Lough <i>et al</i>., 1983; Rosenberg 
  <i>et al</i>., 1993). Major objections to the use of these analogs include the 
  relatively minor changes in climate involved (although small changes could be 
  adequate for examining near-term climate change) and, again, differences between 
  the causes of historical fluctuations and those of posited larger future climate 
  changes (Glantz, 1988; Pittock, 1989). </p>
<p><i>Spatial analogs</i>: These are regions that today have a climate analogous 
  to that anticipated in the study region in future. For example, Bergth&oacute;rsson 
  et al. (1988) used temperatures in northern Britain as a spatial analog for 
  the potential future temperatures over Iceland. The approach is severely restricted, 
  however, by the frequent lack of correspondence between other important features 
  (climatic and nonclimatic) of the two regions. Nevertheless, spatial analogs 
  are still adopted in a few studies&#151;for example, to assess potential effects 
  of climate change on human health (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
