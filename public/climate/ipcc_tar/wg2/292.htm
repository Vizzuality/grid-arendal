<a name="64"></a><h2>6.4. Coastal Systems</h2>
<a name="641"></a><h3>6.4.1. General Considerations</h3>
<p>Coastal environments occupy one of the most dynamic interfaces on Earth, at 
  the boundary between land and sea, and they support some of the most diverse 
  and productive habitats. These habitats include natural ecosystems, in addition 
  to important managed ecosystems, economic sectors, and major urban centers. 
  The existence of many coastal ecosystems is dependent on the land-sea connection 
  or arises directly from it (e.g., deltas and estuaries). Coastal ecosystems 
  can encompass a wide range of environmental conditions over short distances, 
  particularly of salinity (from fresh to hypersaline) and energy (from sheltered 
  wetlands to energetic wave-washed shorelines). At a much coarser geographical 
  scale, there is a spectrum of climate types&#151;from tropical to polar&#151;with 
  concomitant broad-scale differences in biogeophysical processes and features. 
  Coastal environments, settlements, and infrastructure are exposed to land-sourced 
  and marine hazards such as storms (including tropical cyclones), associated 
  waves and storm surges, tsunamis, river flooding, shoreline erosion, and influx 
  of biohazards such as algal blooms and pollutants. All of these factors need 
  to be recognized in assessing climate-change impacts in the coastal zone.</p>

<p>A summary of potential impacts appears in <a href="#box6-3">Box 6-3</a>. Note, however, that owing 
  to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences 
  in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the 
  resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the 
  impacts summarized here will be highly variable in time and space and will not 
  necessarily be negative in all situations.</p>
<p>Some natural features of the shore zone provide significant coastal protection, 
  including coral reefs (the most extensive, massive, and effective coastal protection 
  structures in the world); sand and gravel beaches, which function as wave energy 
  sinks; and barrier beaches, which act as natural breakwaters. Coastal dunes 
  form natural buffers and sand repositories, from which sand may be extracted 
  during storms without major shoreline retreat; coastal vegetation often absorbs 
  wind or wave energy, retarding shoreline erosion. Even the value of salt marsh 
  as a sea defense (King and Lester, 1995) and mangroves as a sediment trap (Solomon 
  and Forbes, 1999) have been recognized. These functions of natural coastal systems 
  contribute to resilience, as discussed in <a href="301.htm#662">Section 6.6.2</a>.</p>
<p>Bijlsma <i>et al.</i> (1996) and the various regional reports in IPCC (1998) identify 
  the areas of greatest sensitivity to accelerated sea-level rise. These areas 
  comprised low-elevation coral atolls and reef islands, as well as low-lying 
  deltaic, coastal plain, and barrier coasts, including sandy beaches, coastal 
  wetlands, estuaries, and lagoons. To this list can be added coarse gravel beaches 
  and barriers, especially if sediment-starved; cliffed coasts in unlithified 
  deposits, particularly where the proportion of sand and gravel is limited; and 
  ice-rich cliffed coasts in high latitudes. Bold and rock-dominated coasts are 
  relatively less vulnerable but often include coastal reentrants with beaches, 
  estuaries, or deltas, which may represent areas of localized vulnerability. 
  On such coasts, wave runup and overtopping can be a factor that threatens infrastructure 
  situated well above mean sea level (Forbes, 1996).</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that vulnerable coastal types in many parts of 
  the world already are experiencing relative sea-level rise, from a combination 
  of subsidence and the global component of sea-level rise identified to date. 
  Submergence rates of 2.5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> or more are not uncommon, and higher rates 
  apply locally, such as in parts of China (Ren, 1994), the United States (Dean, 
  1990), Canada (Shaw <i>et al.</i>, 1998a), and Argentina (Codignotto, 1997). Although 
  this sea-level rise implies enhanced vulnerability, it also provides a basis 
  for assessing coastal response to various rates of relative sea-level rise, 
  where similar coastal types, boundary conditions, and system properties can 
  be identified. Numerous studies along the U.S. Atlantic coast, where relative 
  sea level is rising at rates of 2-4 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, have demonstrated common patterns 
  of barrier beach retreat by washover and ephemeral inlet processes (Leatherman 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). More rapid retreat is recorded in delta-margin settings characterized 
  by rapid subsidence (e.g., Stone and McBride, 1998).</p>
<p>In addition to submergence, seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers in deltaic 
  and nondeltaic areas is an increasing problem with rising sea level (Moore, 
  1999). This intrusion has been documented in diverse environments such as the 
  arid Israeli coast, the humid Thailand coast, the Chinese Yangtze Delta, the 
  Vietnamese Mekong Delta, and low-lying atolls (e.g., Melloul and Goldberg, 1997; 
  Chen and Stanley, 1998; Singh and Gupta, 1999).</p>
<p>Although some low, sediment-starved, gravel barrier beaches show rapid retreat 
  under rising sea level, this process is highly nonlinear and in some cases is 
  more closely related to storm event frequency and severity (Forbes <i>et al.</i>, 1997a). 
  The response of coasts to storm-related sea-level variations around the North 
  Sea has not been determined, although past increases in the winter means of 
  high water levels of the order of 1-2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> have taken place (Langenberg 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
