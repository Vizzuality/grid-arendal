<h2>1.5. How do the Complexities of Analysis Affect the Assessment? </h2>
<p>The threat posed by climate change must be considered in the context of efforts 
  by countries around the world to achieve sustainable development (see <a href="055.htm">Section 
  1.1</a>). Improved analysis of impacts of and adaptation to climate change is 
  important for the development of appropriate policy measures. However, the chain 
  of events from human behaviors that give rise to disturbances to the climatic 
  system; to atmospheric changes; to impacts on humans, societies, other species, 
  ecosystems, and their adaptive responses is very complex (as noted in <a href="068.htm">Chapters 
  2</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>). Uncertainty is a common feature in the 
  discussion of complexity, and it is compounded by the complex interactions of 
  many subsystems that constitute the socionatural system, each of which has its 
  own inherent uncertainties (see <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a>). This section 
  summarizes some of the complexities that make it difficult to provide very many 
  highly confident projections about climatic impacts-assessments that are directly 
  relevant to the oft-asked policy question: "What should we do about climate 
  change?" (see <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> and references therein for more 
  complete treatment). </p>
<h3><a name="151"></a>1.5.1. Regional Climate Uncertainties </h3>
<p>At the regional level, there is a wide range of projected changes in temperature 
  and precipitation simulated from a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  because of large model-to-model differences. Annex B of the Special Report on 
  Regional Impacts of Climate Change (IPCC, 1998) provides the following conclusion 
  regarding the confidence that can be placed in regional climate projections: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>"Analysis of surface air temperature and precipitation results from regional 
    climate change experiments carried out with AOGCMs indicates that the biases 
    in present-day simulations of regional climate change and the inter-model 
    variability in the simulated regional changes are still too large to yield 
    a high level of confidence in simulated change scenarios. The limited number 
    of experiments available with statistical downscaling techniques and nested 
    regional models has shown that complex topographical features, large lake 
    systems, and narrow land masses not resolved at the resolution of current 
    GCMs significantly affect the simulated regional and local change scenarios, 
    both for precipitation and (to a lesser extent) temperature (IPCC, 1996a). 
    This adds a further degree of uncertainty in the use of GCM-produced scenarios 
    for impact assessments. In addition, most climate change experiments have 
    not accounted for human-induced landscape changes and only recently has the 
    effect of aerosols been vigorously investigated. Both these factors can further 
    affect projections of regional climate change." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wide range of projected changes in temperature and precipitation would 
  affect the degree of exposure of systems and populations to climatic stimuli 
  and hence their vulnerability to climate change. This range suggests that high 
  confidence will not often be assigned to any regional impact assessments that 
  are based on GCM results. Difficulty in obtaining many highly confident outcomes 
  is why the term "climate scenarios" has been adopted in most impact assessments. 
  Such scenarios should be regarded as internally consistent patterns of plausible 
  future climates, not predictions carrying assessed probabilities (see <a href="103.htm">Section 
  2.6</a> and <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Decisionmakers need to be aware 
  of the large range of plausible climate projections when they formulate strategies 
  to cope with the risks of climate change. However, in the absence of some explicit 
  estimation of the likelihood of various scenarios by those who produce them, 
  users of the many decision frameworks in the literature (see <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 
  1-2</a> and <a href="112.htm">Section 2.7</a>) often have to impute likelihood 
  to various scenarios to apply many of these methods. </p>
<p>The review chapters in this report summarize impact studies that are based 
  on a range of climate scenarios, when available. As noted earlier, transient 
  scenarios are particularly valuable because the Earth currently is undergoing 
  a transient response to global change disturbances. Great care is required in 
  interpreting and comparing results from research or assessments that use different 
  climate scenarios, particularly when some conclusions follow from static scenarios 
  and others from transient scenarios. Unfortunately, such mixed use of scenarios 
  is still a problem in the literature and in assessments of it. </p>
