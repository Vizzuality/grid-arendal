<h4>14.2.1.5. Biodiversity </h4>
<p>Latin America is known as home to some of the Earth's greatest concentrations 
  of biodiversity (Heywood and Watson, 1995; Harcourt and Sayer, 1996). Seven 
  of the world's most diverse and threatened areas are in Latin America and 
  the Caribbean (Myers <i>et al</i>., 2000). Of these, three rank among the world's 
  five most critical hotspots. The tropical Andes qualifies as one of the world's 
  two hyper-hot areas for its exceptional numbers of endemic plants and endemic 
  vertebrates&#151;the highest in the world. Maintenance of this diversity depends 
  on the continued existence of representative areas of natural ecosystems (Fearnside 
  and Ferraz, 1995; Fearnside, 1999). Dinerstein <i>et al.</i> (1995) have divided 
  Latin America into 191 terrestrial "ecoregions" and collated information 
  on the biodiversity importance and degree of risk of each in a systematic fashion 
  to establish priorities for conservation. Many ecosystems already are at risk, 
  without additional stresses expected from climatic change: 48% of all ecoregions 
  are critical (18%) or endangered (30%); 32% are vulnerable, 16% are relatively 
  stable, and 5% are relatively intact. Ecuador holds the distinction of being 
  wholly covered by ecoregions with top priority at the regional level. The impacts 
  of climate change can be expected to increase the risk of biodiversity loss 
  in Latin America.</p>
<p>Central America has about 8% of the world's biodiversity concentrated 
  in only 0.4% of the emerged surface of the planet. More than 15,000 species 
  of plants and 1,800 species of vertebrates have been identified in the region. 
  There are high quantities and variety of coastal wetlands in Central America. 
  Central America's unique location between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean 
  Sea&#151;along with extreme climatic variations, tidal patterns, and geology&#151;make 
  these coastal wetlands among the most productive in the world (Tabilo-Valdivieso, 
  1997). </p>
<p>In addition to the loss of genetic resources, loss of productivity, and loss 
  of ecosystem buffering against ecological perturbation, loss of biodiversity 
  also may alter or impair the services that ecosystems provide (Naeem <i>et al.,</i> 
  1994). For a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenario, surface relative humidity zones shift 
  upward by hundreds of meters during the winter dry season, when these forests 
  typically rely mostly on moisture from cloud contact (Leo, 1995). At the same 
  time, an increase in the warmth index implies increased evapotranspiration; 
  this combination of reduce cloud contact and increased evapotranspiration could 
  have serious conservation implications, as indicated in studies in anurans (Donnelly 
  and Crump, 1998). The results of Pounds <i>et al</i>. (1999) indicate the association 
  in populations of birds, lizards, and anurans with the same climatic patterns, 
  implying a broad response to regional climate change. Other studies inspired 
  by the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis have found that dry weather in 1983 
  increased the vulnerability of harlequin frogs (<i>Atelopus varius</i>) to lethal 
  parasites along one stream (Crump and Pounds, 1985, 1989). </p>
<p>Su&aacute;rez <i>et al</i>. (1999) have found that the coastal biodiversity 
  (flora and fauna) in Cuba will be most affected by sea-level rise. Adaptation 
  options include establishing a national legal system and a national strategy 
  for conserving biodiversity that includes terrestrial, marine, or coastal reserves.
