<h2>18.5. Adaptive Capacity and its Determinants </h2>
<a name="1851"></a> 
<h3>18.5.1. Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity</h3>
<p>Considerable attention has been devoted to the characteristics of systems (communities 
  or regions) that influence their propensity or ability to adapt (as part of 
  impact and vulnerability assessment) and/or their priority for adaptation measures 
  (as a basis for policy development). These characteristics have been called 
  <i>determinants of adaptation</i>. Generic concepts such as sensitivity, vulnerability, 
  susceptibility, coping range, critical levels, adaptive capacity, stability, 
  robustness, resilience, and flexibility have been used to differentiate systems 
  according to their likelihood, need, or ability for adaptation (Sprengers <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1994; De Ruig, 1997; Klein and Tol, 1997; Smithers and Smit, 1997; 
  Adger and Kelly, 1999; Kelly and Adger, 1999). These characteristics influence 
  (promote, inhibit, stimulate, dampen, or exaggerate) the occurrence and nature 
  of adaptations and thereby circumscribe the vulnerability of systems and their 
  residual impacts. In the hazards literature, these characteristics are reflected 
  in socially constructed or endogenous risks (Blaikie <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Hewitt, 
  1997). Together (in whole or part), they represent the adaptive capacity of 
  a system.</p>
<p><a href="#tab18-5">Table 18-5</a> lists terms that are commonly used to characterize the adaptive 
  propensity of systems to climate stimuli. There is considerable overlap in the 
  basic concepts captured in these terms. Particular terms have been employed 
  to distinguish natural from socioeconomic systems or to differentiate the condition 
  of a system before adaptation from its condition after adaptation (Klein and 
  Nicholls, 1998). These distinctions are important and can be captured without 
  narrowing the meaning of widely used terms. Thus, ecosystem vulnerability is 
  different from socioeconomic vulnerability.</p>

<p>Adaptive capacity refers to the potential, capability, or ability of a system 
  to adapt to climate change stimuli or their effects or impacts. Adaptive capacity 
  greatly influences the vulnerability of communities and regions to climate change 
  effects and hazards (Bohle <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Downing <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Kelly and Adger, 
  1999; Mileti, 1999; Kates, 2000). Vulnerability has been described as the "capacity 
  to be wounded" (Kates <i>et al.</i>, 1985). Human activities and groups are considered 
  sensitive to climate to the degree that they can be affected by it and vulnerable 
  to the degree that they can be harmed (Rayner and Malone, 1998). Because vulnerability 
  and its causes play essential roles in determining impacts, understanding the 
  dynamics of vulnerability is as important as understanding climate itself (Liverman, 
  1990; Handmer <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>With regard to climate change, the vulnerability of a given system or society 
  is a function of its physical exposure to climate change effects and its ability 
  to adapt to these conditions. Chambers (1989) distinguishes between these two 
  aspects of differential vulnerability: physical exposure to the hazardous agent 
  and the ability to cope with its impacts. Thus, vulnerability recognizes the 
  role of socioeconomic systems in amplifying or moderating the impacts of climate 
  change and "emphasizes the degree to which the risks of climate catastrophe 
  can be cushioned or ameliorated by adaptive actions that or can be brought within 
  the reach of populations at risk" (Downing, 1991).</p>
<p>The significance of climate variation or change depends on the change itself 
  and the characteristics of the society exposed to it (Ausubel, 1991a; Rayner 
  and Malone, 1998; Munasinghe, 2000). These characteristics of society determine 
  its adaptive capacity and its adaptability. Adaptive capacity refers to the 
  ability to prepare for hazards and opportunities in advance (as in anticipatory 
  adaptation) and to respond or cope with the effects (as in reactive adaptation).</p>
<p>Studies of similar hazardous events recurring at different times in a given 
  region show vastly different consequences because of societal transformations 
  that occurred between the events. For example, rainfall and temperature fluctuations 
  in western Europe have far milder effects on human well-being today (society 
  generally is less vulnerable) than they did in the medieval and early modern 
  periods, essentially as a result of enhanced adaptive capacity that reflects 
  changes in practices, economics, and government programs (Abel, 1976; De Vries, 
  1977; Rayner and Malone, 1998). Similarly, particular climate events or hazards 
  can have "vastly different consequences for those on whom they infringe 
  because of differences in coping ability" (Rayner and Malone, 1998). An 
  extreme climatic event will result in higher losses of life in a developing 
  country than in a developed country because of differential adaptive capacity 
  (Burton, <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Blaikie <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Kundzewicz and Takeuchi, 1999). 
  Martens <i>et al.</i> (1999) describe potential adaptations to deal with increases 
  in disease incidence associated with climate change but note that in most poor 
  developing countries, socioeconomic, technical, and political barriers will 
  mean that the changed health risks will not be addressed. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" In developing countries overall social, environmental, and economic 
    vulnerability enhances the effects of droughts and other climatic events. 
    Overpopulation (relative to current productivity, income, and natural resources), 
    poverty, and land degradation translate into a poor capacity to face any kind 
    of crisis. Poor people have no insurance against loss of income. Weak economic 
    structures mean difficulties in maintaining jobs during an economic failure. 
    Degraded marginal lands become totally unproductive when precipitation decreases. 
    As a result, these regions have difficulty in facing climatic crises, although 
    such crises are recurrent. Any extreme climatic event can become a social 
    catastrophe when combined with the social-political characteristics of the 
    region. For example, the droughts and internecine wars in Ethiopia interact 
    to increase the adverse effects of both. Although developing regions are more 
    vulnerable to climate changes than are developed countries, the degree of 
    vulnerability varies in each specific region." (Magalh&atilde;es, 1996)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research on comparative adaptive capacity and vulnerability is evolving, and 
  its difficulties are well recognized (Bohle <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Downing, 1996; Handmer 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Kelly and Adger, 1999). Estimates of adaptive capacity tend to 
  be based on premises such as the position that highly managed systems (such 
  as agriculture), given sufficient resources, are likely to be more adaptable 
  (and at a lower cost) than less managed ecosystems (Strzepek and Smith, 1995; 
  Burton, 1996; Toman and Bierbaum, 1996). It is also widely accepted that systems 
  with high levels of capacity to cope with historical and/or existing stresses 
  can be expected to have high adaptive capacity for stresses associated with 
  climatic change (Ausubel, 1991a). Such premises have formed the basis for broad 
  assessments of sensitivity and adaptability (USNAS, 1992). Of course, sensitivity 
  and adaptive capacity vary according to the climate change-related stress being 
  considered. Thus, adaptive capacity to gradual changes in mean temperature may 
  be high (or not much needed), but adaptive capacity to changes in the magnitude 
  or frequency of extreme climatic conditions may not be so high (Appendi and 
  Liverman, 1996).</p>
