<h2><a name="172"></a>17.2. Key Regional Concerns</h2>
<h3><a name="1721"></a>17.2.1. development, Sustainability, and Equity Issues</h3>
<p>The small island states account for less than 1% of global GHG emissions but 
  are among the most vulnerable of all areas to the potential adverse effects 
  of climate change and sea-level rise (Jones, 1998; Nurse <i>et al.,</i> 1998). 
  It has been established that there already is a global commitment to climate 
  change and sea-level rise as a result of greenhouse forcing arising from historic 
  emissions (Warwick <i>et al., </i>1996; Jones, 1998; Nicholls<i> et al.,</i> 
  1999; Parry <i>et al., </i>1999). Moreover, analysis has shown that even with 
  a fully implemented Kyoto Protocol, by 2050 warming would be only about 1/20th 
  of a degree less than what is projected by the IPCC (Parry <i>et al.,</i> 1999). 
  Therefore, climate change impacts are inevitable. </p>
<p>Thus, owing to their high vulnerability and low adaptive capacity to climate 
  change, communities in small island states have legitimate concerns about their 
  future on the basis of the past observational record and present climate model 
  projections. Economic development, quality of life, and alleviation of poverty 
  presently constitute the most pressing concerns of many small island states. 
  Thus, with limited resources and low adaptive capacity, these islands face the 
  considerable challenge of charting development paths that are sustainable and 
  controlling GHG emissions, without jeopardizing prospects for economic development 
  and improvements in human welfare (Munasinghe, 2000; Toth, 2000). At the same 
  time, given the inevitability of climate change and sea-level rise, they are 
  forced to find resources to implement strategies to adapt to increasing threats 
  resulting from GHG forcing of the climate system, to which they contribute little 
  (Hay and Sem, 1999; Sachs, 2000). Consequently, the already meager resources 
  of these island states will be placed under further pressure.</p>

<h3><a name="1722"></a>17.2.2 Water-Level Changes</h3>
<h4><a name="17221"></a>17.2.2.1. Sea-Level Rise</h4>
<p>Although the severity of the threat will vary regionally, sea-level rise of 
  the magnitude currently projected (i.e., 5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, with a range 
  of 2-9 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>), is expected to have disproportionately great 
  effects on the economic and social development of many small island states (Granger, 
  1997; IPCC, 1998). Coastal land loss already is projected to have widespread 
  adverse consequences. Indeed, it is argued that land loss from sea-level rise, 
  especially on atolls (e.g., those in the Pacific and Indian Oceans) and low 
  limestone islands (e.g., those in the Caribbean), is likely to be of a magnitude 
  that would disrupt virtually all economic and social sectors in these countries 
  (Leatherman, 1997). Recent estimates indicate that with a 1-m rise in sea level, 
  10.3 km<sup>2</sup> of land in Tongatapu island, Tonga, would be lost (Mimura 
  and Pelesikoti, 1997). This figure would increase to 37.3 km<sup>2</sup> (14%) 
  with storm surge superimposed on a 1-m sea-level rise scenario. For some main 
  Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia) sites, a retreat of 9 to 96 m is 
  projected with a 1-m rise in sea level (Richmond <i>et al.,</i> 1997). On Majuro 
  Atoll, Marshall Islands, land loss from one area based on the Bruun rule is 
  estimated to be nearly 65 ha of dry land from a 1-m rise in sea level (Holthus 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1992).</p>
<p>One of the most serious considerations for some small islands is whether they 
  will have adequate potential to adapt to sea-level rise within their own national 
  boundaries (Nurse, 1992; IPCC, 1998). In tiny islands where physical space already 
  is very scarce, adaptation measures such as retreat to higher ground and use 
  of building set-backs appear to have little practical utility. In extreme circumstances, 
  sea-level rise and its associated consequences could trigger abandonment and 
  significant "off-island migration," at great economic and social costs 
  (Leatherman, 1997; Nicholls and Mimura, 1998). </p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 17-1. Climate Change Scenarios for the South 
        Pacific Region </b> </div>
      <p>As part of the Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Programme, the 
        Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has 
        prepared regional climate change scenarios for the four South Pacific 
        regions of Micronesia, Melanesia, and north and south Polynesia (Jones 
        <i>et al., </i>1999). Six coupled atmosphere-ocean climate simulations 
        were included in the analysis of regional climate change scenarios: CSIRO 
        Mark 2 GCM with and without sulfates, CSIRO DARLAM 125 km, DKRZ ECHAM4/OPYC3 
        GCM, Hadley Centre HADCM2, and the Canadian CGCM1. The regional scenarios 
        derived can be considered as projections that represent a range of possible 
        future climates.</p>
      <p>Generally, the models project a temperature increase that is less than 
        the global mean. Results show the least warming in the South Pacific; 
        regional maximum warming is projected in the far west, central, and eastern 
        equatorial Pacific. Four of the models show an increase in rainfall over 
        the central and eastern Pacific over both half-years (i.e., May to October 
        and November to April). Movements of both the ITCZ and the SPCZ were not 
        consistent between models, but rainfall consistently increased. Increases 
        in daily rainfall intensity are expected in regions where rainfall increases, 
        remains the same, or decreases slightly, as derived from several models 
        and studies. Thus, high confidence is attached to this result.</p>
      <p>Historical sea-level rise over the Pacific from tide gauge records adjusted 
        for postglacial rebound is consistent with global estimates of 1-2 
        mm yr<sup>-1</sup>. ENSO is the dominant influence on climate variability 
        in the Pacific, and model outputs show that the ENSO phenomenon is likely 
        to continue to 2100. The results also suggest that under climate change, 
        there is likely to be a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like mean state over the Pacific. 
        There is no evidence that tropical cyclone numbers may change, but a general 
        increase in<i> tropical cyclone intensity,</i> expressed as possible increases 
        in wind speed and central pressure of 10-20% with 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
        equivalent, now appears likely. Moderate confidence is attached to this 
        result. No significant change in regions of formation was noted in the 
        DARLAM 125 km resolution simulation, although this may alter in response 
        to long-term changes to ENSO. Although there appears to be no major change 
        in regions of origin, tropical cyclones showed a tendency to track further 
        poleward. Low confidence is attached to this result.</p>

<h4><a name="17222"></a>17.2.2.2. Storm Surge and Flood Risks</h4>
<p>Changes in the highest sea levels at a given locality will result from the 
  change in mean sea level at that location and changes in storm-surge heights. 
  If mean sea level rises, present extreme levels will be attained more frequently, 
  all else being equal. The increase in maximum heights will be equal to the change 
  in the mean, which implies a significant increase in the area threatened with 
  inundation. This will be especially true in areas with a small surge envelope, 
  which is typical in most small islands. Under such circumstances, even incrementally 
  small elevations in sea level would have severely negative effects on atolls 
  and low islands (Forbes and Solomon, 1997; Nicholls<i> et al., </i>1999).</p>
<p>Changes in storm-surge heights also would result from alterations in the occurrence 
  of strong winds and low pressures, as would occur during the passage of tropical 
  storms and cyclones. It is already known that tropical cyclones are the major 
  cause of storm surges that impact small islands in the Atlantic, Pacific, and 
  Indian Oceans. Changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones could 
  result from alterations to SST, large-scale atmospheric circulation, and the 
  characteristics of ENSO (Pittock<i> et al.,</i> 1996). Although there is no 
  consensus yet with regard to whether there will be changes in the behavior of 
  these systems (Royer<i> et al.,</i> 1998; Jones <i>et al.,</i> 1999), the prospect 
  of extreme sea levels (related to storm surges and higher wave amplitudes) is 
  a concern that small island states cannot easily ignore. </p>
<p>Based on global sea-level rise scenarios produced by the Hadley Centre (HADCM2 
and HADCM3), Nicholls<i> et al.</i> (1999) estimate that global sea levels are 
expected to rise by about 38 cm between 1990 and the 2080s. They project that 
many coastal areas are likely to experience annual or more frequent flooding, 
with the islands of the Caribbean and the Indian and Pacific Oceans facing the 
largest relative increase in flood risk. Projected out to the 2080s, the number 
of people facing high flood risk from sea-level rise in these regions would be 
200 times higher than in the case of no climate change (Nicholls <i>et al.,</i> 
1999). Recent studies for Cuba (based on HADCM2 and IS92a scenarios) also project 
that 98 coastal settlements with a combined population exceeding 50,000 persons 
would be inundated by a 1-m rise in sea level (Perez <i>et al., </i>1999).</p>
