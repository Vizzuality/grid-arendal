<h1><a name="21"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<i>The Australia and New Zealand Region:</i> This region spans the tropics to 
mid-latitudes and has varied climates and ecosystems, including deserts, rainforests, 
coral reefs, and alpine areas. The climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding 
oceans. The El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon leads to floods 
and prolonged droughts, especially in eastern Australia and parts of New Zealand. 
The region therefore is sensitive to the possible changes toward a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
mean state suggested by Working Group I. Extreme events are a major source of 
current climate impacts, and changes in extreme events are expected to dominate 
impacts of climate change. Return periods for heavy rains, floods, and storm surges 
of a given magnitude at particular locations would be modified by possible increases 
in intensity of tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms, and heavy rain events 
(medium confidence) and changes in the location-specific frequency of tropical 
cyclones (low to medium confidence). Scenarios of climate change based on recent 
coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models suggest that large areas of mainland Australia 
will experience significant decreases in rainfall during the 21st century (low 
to medium confidence). 
<p>Before stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, the north-south 
  temperature gradient in mid-southern latitudes is expected to increase (medium 
  to high confidence), strengthening the westerlies and the associated west-to-east 
  gradient of rainfall across Tasmania and New Zealand. Following stabilization 
  of GHG concentrations, these trends would be reversed (medium confidence).</p>
<p><i>Water Supply and Hydrology:</i> In some areas, water resources already are 
  stressed and are highly vulnerable, with intense competition for water supply. 
  This is especially so with respect to salinization (parts of Australia) and 
  competition for water between agriculture, power generation, urban areas, and 
  environmental flows (high confidence). Increased evaporation and possible decreases 
  of rainfall in many areas would adversely affect water supply, agriculture, 
  and the survival and reproduction of key species in parts of Australia and New 
  Zealand (medium confidence).</p>
<p><i>Ecosystems and Conservation:</i> Warming of 1&deg;C would threaten the survival 
  of species currently growing near the upper limit of their temperature range, 
  notably in some Australian alpine regions that already are near these limits, 
  as well as in the southwest of western Australia. Other species that have restricted 
  climatic niches and are unable to migrate because of fragmentation of the landscape, 
  soil differences, or topography could become endangered or extinct. Other ecosystems 
  that are particularly threatened by climate change include coral reefs (Australia) 
  and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone and inland.</p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber:</i> Agricultural activities are particularly vulnerable 
  to regional reductions in rainfall in southwest and inland Australia (medium 
  confidence) and eastern New Zealand. Drought frequency and consequent stresses 
  on agriculture are likely to increase in parts of Australia and New Zealand 
  as a result of higher temperatures and possibly more frequent El Ni&ntilde;os 
  (medium confidence). Enhanced plant growth and water-use efficiency (WUE) resulting 
  from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) increases may provide initial benefits 
  that offset any negative impacts from climate change (medium confidence), although 
  the balance is expected to become negative with warmings in excess of 2-4&deg;C 
  and associated rainfall decreases (medium confidence). Reliance on exports of 
  agricultural and forest products makes the region sensitive to changes in commodity 
  prices induced by changes in climate elsewhere.</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand fisheries are influenced by the extent and location 
  of nutrient upwellings governed by prevailing winds and boundary currents. In 
  addition, ENSO influences recruitment of some fish species and the incidence 
  of toxic algal blooms. There is as yet insufficient knowledge about impacts 
  of climate changes on regional ocean currents and about physical-biological 
  linkages to enable confident predictions of changes in fisheries productivity.</p>
<p><i>Settlements, Industry, and Human Health:</i> Marked trends to greater population 
  and investment in exposed coastal regions are increasing vulnerability to tropical 
  cyclones and storm surges. Thus, projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity 
  and possible changes in their location-specific frequency, along with sea-level 
  rise, would have major impacts&#151;notably, increased storm-surge heights for 
  a given return period (medium to high confidence). Increased frequency of high-intensity 
  rainfall would increase flood damages to settlements and infrastructure (medium 
  confidence). There is high confidence that projected climate changes will enhance 
  the spread of some disease vectors, thereby increasing the potential for disease 
  outbreaks, despite existing biosecurity and health services. </p>
<p><i>Vulnerability and Adaptation:</i> Climate change will add to existing stresses 
  on achievement of sustainable land use and conservation of terrestrial and aquatic 
  biodiversity. These stresses include invasion by exotic animal and plant species, 
  degradation and fragmentation of natural ecosystems through agricultural and 
  urban development, dryland salinization (Australia), removal of forest cover 
  (Australia and New Zealand), and competition for scarce water resources. Within 
  both countries there are economically and socially disadvantaged groups of people, 
  especially indigenous peoples, that are particularly vulnerable to additional 
  stresses on health and living conditions induced by climate change. Major exacerbating 
  problems include rapid population and infrastructure growth in vulnerable coastal 
  areas, inappropriate use of water resources, and complex institutional arrangements. 
  Adaptation to climate change, as a means of maximizing gains and minimizing 
  losses, is important for Australia and New Zealand but is relatively little 
  explored. Options include improving water-use efficiency and effective trading 
  mechanisms for water; more appropriate land-use policies; provision of climate 
  information and seasonal forecasts to land users, to help them manage for climate 
  variability and change; improved crop cultivars; revised engineering standards 
  and zoning for infrastructure development; and improved biosecurity and health 
  services. Such measures often will have other benefits, but they also may have 
  costs and limits.</p>
<p><i>Integrated Assessments:</i> Comprehensive cross-sectoral estimates of net 
  climate change impact costs for various GHG emission scenarios, as well as for 
  different societal scenarios, are not yet available. Confidence remains very 
  low in the previously reported (Basher et al., 1998) estimate for Australia 
  and New Zealand of -1.2 to -3.8% of gross domestic product for an equivalent 
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This out-of-date estimate did not 
  account for many currently identified effects and adaptations. </p>
<p><i>Summary:</i> Australia has significant vulnerability to changes in temperature 
  and precipitation projected for the next 50-100 years (very high confidence) 
  because it already has extensive arid and semi-arid areas and lies largely in 
  the tropics and subtropics. New Zealand, a smaller and more mountainous country 
  with a generally more temperate maritime climate, may be more resilient to climate 
  changes than Australia, although considerable regional vulnerability remains 
  (medium confidence).</p>
