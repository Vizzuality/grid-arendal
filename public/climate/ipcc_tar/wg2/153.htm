<h3>3.7.3. Tools Capable of Addressing Interactions </h3>
<p>Most climate scenarios for impact assessments were developed by using outputs 
  from AOGCMs (Hulme and Brown, 1998). Often these results are scaled toward the 
  desired emission levels with simple climate models (Hulme <i>et al</i>., 1995; 
  Harvey <i>et al</i>., 1997; see <a href="155.htm#383">Section 3.8.3</a>). In 
  this simple approach, most interactions are neglected.</p>
<p>The only models that can be used to develop more consistent scenarios that 
  incorporate most of the important interactions are IAMs (see <a href="133.htm">Section 
  3.3.2.3</a>). IAMs have been developed with different levels of complexity, 
  from extremely simple to highly complex (Harvey <i>et al</i>., 1997). Different 
  interactions are included, although no single model provides a fully comprehensive 
  treatment. The models are most commonly used for emission scenario development 
  and mitigation policy assessment (Schimel <i>et al</i>., 1997a; Alcamo <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998a; Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1998). All simulate a causal chain (e.g., 
  human activities, emissions, climate change, sea-level rise, and other impacts). 
  Emissions, climate change, impact, and mitigation scenarios derived from these 
  models have been published (Schimel <i>et al</i>., 1997a; Leemans <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1998) and collected in several databases (Alcamo 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995; Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 2000). Unfortunately, it is 
  not always clear which interactions are explicitly included in individual IAMs. 
  This reduces the comparability of individual IAM-derived scenarios and thus 
  their utility.</p>
<p>Depending on assumed interactions during scenario development, a wide range 
  of estimates of climate change and its impacts is possible (see <a href="149.htm#tab37">Table 
  3-7</a>). However, within this range certain responses are more likely than 
  others. To define appropriate and realistic levels of interactions, expert judgment 
  and sensitivity experiments with models could be very valuable (van der Sluijs, 
  1997). Innovative, objective, and systematic approaches have to be developed 
  to evaluate underlying scenario assumptions and to validate the scenario results. 
  This is still an immature area of scenario development.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="374"></a>3.7.4. Problems of Compatibility between Scenarios</h3>
<p>One difficulty faced by authors in attempting to summarize and synthesize the 
  results of impact studies for previous IPCC assessments (i.e., IPCC, 1996b, 
  1998) has been a lack of consistency in projections. Different climate projections 
  have been adopted in different studies, in different regions (or within the 
  same region), and in different sectors. Moreover, even where the same climate 
  projections are assumed, they might not be applied in the same way in different 
  impact studies. Finally, some studies also are inconsistent in their methods 
  of projecting changes in climate alongside concurrent changes in related socioeconomic 
  and environmental conditions.<br>
</p>
<p>For example, GHG concentrations often are transformed into CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent 
  concentrations to determine radiative forcing levels and climate change. The 
  GCM community often presents climate change simulations as "doubled CO<sub>2</sub>" 
  anomalies. Depending on the scenario, however, 5-40% of the forcing is 
  caused by non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs (30% in 1990). The doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  scenarios often are interpreted as CO<sub>2</sub> only (e.g., Cramer <i>et al</i>., 
  1997); others add an explicit distinction between CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases (e.g., Downing <i>et al</i>., 1999). In determining the impacts of direct 
  CO<sub>2</sub> effects and climate change, this can easily lead to inconsistencies. 
  Similar discrepancies exist for other types of interactions. </p>
<p>Finally, it is a significant challenge to integrate climate or sea-level rise 
  scenarios, with a time horizon of decades to hundreds of years, with nonclimatic 
  scenarios of social, economic, and technological systems that can change rapidly 
  over a time scale of years. For instance, it is difficult to devise credible 
  socioeconomic scenarios that extend beyond the lifetime of current infrastructure 
  and institutions. Moreover, social/economic actors who need to be involved in 
  the scenario development process (e.g., business, governments) often find long 
  time horizons difficult to contemplate. <a href="150.htm#box32">Box 3-2</a> 
  illustrates a recent example of an attempt to harmonize climate change, sea 
  level, atmospheric composition, and socioeconomic scenarios in a multi-sectoral 
  global impact assessment.</p>

          model for one of four preliminary SRES marker emissions scenarios (B1,

          multi-decadal variability and are orientated according to the correlation
