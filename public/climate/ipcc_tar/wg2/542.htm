<h4>14.2.5.5. Effects on Food Production and Safety</h4>
<p>Climate change would affect human health indirectly by threatening food production, 
  as a result of increased temperature, ultraviolet irradiation, sea-level rise, 
  changes in pest ecology, ecological disruption in agricultural areas as a result 
  of disasters, and socioeconomic shifts in land-use practices (Rosenzweig <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1993; Siqueira <i>et al.,</i> 1994; Reilly <i>et al.,</i> 1996; Haines 
  and McMichael, 1997; Magrin<i> et al., </i>1997c; Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 1998). 
  A link between El Ni&ntilde;o and variation of the inter-tropical convergence 
  zone and drought in northeastern Brazil has been described for many years (Hastenrath 
  and Heller, 1977). Periodic occurrences of severe droughts associated with El 
  Ni&ntilde;o in this agriculturally rich region have resulted in occasional famines 
  (Kiladis and D&iacute;az, 1986; Hastenrath, 1995). Severe food shortages have 
  occurred in this region in 1988 and 1998 (Kovats <i>et al.,</i> 1999).</p>
<p>Developing countries already struggle with large and growing populations, and 
  malnutrition rates would be particularly vulnerable to changes in food production 
  (Patz, 1998). Changes in the distribution of plant pests have implications for 
  food safety. Ocean warming could increase the number of temperature-sensitive 
  toxins produced by phytoplankton, causing contamination of seafood more often 
  and an increased frequency of poisoning. The rapid spread of cholera along the 
  Peruvian coasts and the fact that the <i>V. cholerae </i>01 isolates involved 
  constitute a separate genetic variant that could be a result of environmental 
  change (Wachsmuth <i>et al.,</i> 1991, 1993)&#151;as well as the ability of 
  <i>V. cholerae </i>to survive in seawater and freshwater&#151;make cholera a 
  persistent health hazard (Tamplin and Carrillo, 1991). Thus, climate-induced 
  changes in the production of aquatic pathogens and biotoxins may jeopardize 
  seafood safety (IPCC, 1996). Increased ambient temperature has been associated 
  with food poisoning; multiplication of pathogenic microorganisms in food is 
  strongly dependent on temperature (Colwell and Huq, 1994; Bentham and Langford, 
  1995; Patz, 1998). This indicates the importance of ambient conditions in the 
  food production process, including animal husbandry and slaughtering, to avoid 
  the adverse effects of a warmer climate.</p>
<p>In Argentina, the heavily populated Paran&aacute; Delta could be seriously 
  affected by even small changes in sea level (Kovats<i> et al., </i>1998). The 
  effects of sea-level rise may be counteracted by growing deltas as a result 
  of the large amount of sediment coming down the Paran&aacute; and Uruguay Rivers 
  from intense deforestation and consequential water erosion on the land of the 
  upper basins.</p>
<p>Many glaciers and ice fields may soon disappear, potentially jeopardizing local 
  water supplies that are critical for human consumption, regional agriculture, 
  and hydroelectric power generation (Epstein<i> et al.,</i> 1998). There is high 
  confidence in the effects of warming on glaciers, which already are disappearing 
  in Peru and decreasing in the high Andes between 29&deg;S and 36&deg;S (Canziani 
  <i>et al., </i>1997).</p>
<p>Climate changes are expected to have the greatest effect on health in developing 
  nations in Latin America that already have poor and weak infrastructures. Linkages 
  between local public health and issues of climate change must continue to be 
  considered so that prevention and response mechanisms can be implemented against 
  disease and other threats to human health (Kovats <i>et al.,</i> 1998).</p>
