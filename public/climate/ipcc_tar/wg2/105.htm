<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Moss and Schneider (1997) document several cases in which the SAR authors in 
  each of the three Working Groups use ranges to describe uncertain outcomes but 
  unfortunately had no consistent criteria for assigning probabilities to range 
  limits or for identifying outlier outcomes (those occurring beyond the well-calibrated 
  range limits). Moreover, there was no consistent use of terms to characterize 
  levels of confidence in particular outcomes or common methods for aggregating 
  many individual judgments into a single collective assessment. Recognition of 
  this shortcoming of the SAR led to preparation of a guidance paper on uncertainties 
  (Moss and Schneider, 2000) for use by all three TAR Working Groups and which 
  has been widely reviewed and debated.</p>
<p>Attempts to achieve more consistency in establishing end points of ranges and 
  outlier values (or the distribution of subjective probabilities within and beyond 
  the range) have not received much attention. Despite the difficulty of assigning 
  a distribution of probabilities for uncertain outcomes or processes, the scientific 
  complexity of the climate change issue and the need for information that is 
  useful for policy formulation requires researchers and policymakers to work 
  together toward improved management of uncertainties. A common basis for characterizing 
  sources of uncertainties is one step; <a href="103.htm#box21">Box 2-1</a> represents 
  an attempt in the uncertainties guidance paper (Moss and Schneider, 2000) to 
  provide such a common basis. </p>
<p>In this situation, the research community must bear in mind that users of IPCC 
  reports often assume for themselves what they think the authors believe to be 
  the distribution of probabilities when the authors do not specify it themselves. 
  The decision analytic literature (e.g., Morgan and Henrion, 1990) often suggests 
  that it is preferable for scientists debating the specifics of a topic to provide 
  their best estimates of probability distributions and possible outliers, based 
  on their assessment of the literature, than to have users make their own guesses. 
  This information, along with an appraisal of the limitations of the models, 
  would make the ranges more meaningful to other scientists, the policy community, 
  and the public.</p>
