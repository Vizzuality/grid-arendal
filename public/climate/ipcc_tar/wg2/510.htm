<h4>13.3.4.2. Long-Term Adaptations </h4>
<p>Long-term adaptations refer to major structural changes to overcome adversity 
  caused by climate change. These may include: </p>
<p><ul><li> Changes in land use result from the differential response of crops to climate 
  change. Studies reported by Parry et al. (1988) for central Europe show an "optimal 
  land use" in which the area cultivated with winter wheat, maize, and vegetables 
  increases while the allocation to spring wheat, barley, and potato, decreases. 
  Changes in land allocation also may be used to stabilize production. In this 
  case, crops with high interannual variability in production (e.g., wheat) may 
  be replaced by crops with lower productivity but more stable yields (e.g., pasture). 
  <li> Biotechnology offers another possibility to adapt to stresses (heat, water, 
  pests and disease, etc.) that are enhanced by climate change by allowing development 
  of "designer cultivars" (Goodman et al., 1987)-considering strictly the principles 
  of biosafety to avoid possible negative impacts of this technique. Species that 
  have not been used previously for agricultural purposes may be identified and 
  others already identified may be more quickly brought into use. <li> Crop substitution 
  also may be useful for conservation of soil moisture. Some crops use a low amount 
  of water and are more water- and heat-resistant, so they tolerate dry weather 
  better than others do. For example, sorghum is more tolerant of hot and dry 
  conditions than maize. <li> Microclimate modification may be used to improve WUE 
  in agriculture. Windbreaks, for example, reduce evaporative demand from the 
  plants they shelter. Sheltered plants remain better hydrated and thus are better 
  able to carry out photosynthesis (Rosenberg, 1979). A wide array of intercropping, 
  multi-cropping, relay cropping, and other techniques provide greater production 
  per unit area occupied and can be useful to improve WUE. Irrigation efficiency 
  can be improved considerably with new land-field techniques (laser-leveling 
  of fields, minimum tillage, chiseling compacted soils, stubble mulching, etc.) 
  or new management strategies (irrigation scheduling, monitoring soil moisture 
  status, etc.) (Kromm and White, 1990). <li> Changes in farming systems may be necessary 
  in some areas for farming to remain viable and competitive. Specialized arable 
  farms with production of vegetables, cereals, seed crops, fruits, and other 
  crops often have only a few species on the farm, depending on soil and climate 
  conditions. These specialized farms, especially dairying and arable, may be 
  more affected by climate change than mixed farms. Mixed farms with both livestock 
  and arable production have more options for change and thus larger resilience 
  to change in the environment. </ul>
<p>Studies on adapting farming systems to climate change need to consider all 
  of the agronomic decisions made at the farm level (Kaiser et al., 1993). Economic 
  considerations are very important in this context (Antle, 1996). Results of 
  farm-level analyses on the impacts of climate change generally have shown a 
  large reduction in adverse impacts when adaptation is fully implemented. However, 
  this will result in land-use changes (Parry et al., 1999). </p>
