<h4>11.2.4.2. Deltas, Estuarine, and Other Coastal Ecosystems </h4>
<p>River-borne sediments have formed at least 10 deltas in the coastal zones of 
  Asia with an area of more than 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> each (Coleman and Wright, 
  1975). Delta and estuarine ecosystems are sensitive to complex responses to 
  agents associated with climate change (Sanchez-Arcilla and Jimenez, 1997). Low-lying 
  deltas are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise and increasing shoreline 
  wave action (Walker, 1998). A decrease in river water discharge, as projected 
  under some climate change scenarios, could lead to hindrance of delta progradation 
  and increase the risk of irreversible change for the ecosystem in estuarine-deltaic 
  areas (Qian, et al., 1993; Shi, 1995). Tidal rivers and estuaries will become 
  more prone to saltwater intrusion as a result of projected sea-level rise (Huang, 
  et al., 1982; Li, 1984, 1985; Shi, 1995). Sea-level changes associated with 
  global warming would be exacerbated by tectonic submergence, ground subsidence 
  as a result of groundwater withdrawal, rise of water level created by delta 
  progradation, and eustatic sea-level rise. </p>
<p>Low-lying muddy coastlines associated with large deltas form a significant 
  resource and support large human populations. In China, for example, such low-lying 
  deltas cover about 4,000 km&#151; 22% of the total coastline. These muddy coastal 
  ecosystems are basically distributed along large deltas and partly in semi-closed 
  bays (Ren, 1985). Erosion of muddy coastlines in Asia&#151;as documented in 
  China, for example&#151;is triggered largely by sediment starvation resulting 
  from human activities and delta evolution rather than sea-level rise (Ji et 
  al., 1993; Chen and Chen, 1998). Beach erosion is widespread in the coastal 
  zone of Asia and has been reported in China, Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, 
  Bangladesh, and Malaysia (Xia et al., 1993; Sato and Mimura 1997; Teh 1997; 
  Nishioka and Harasawa, 1998; Huq et al., 1999; Middleton, 1999). </p>
<p>Coastal wetlands frequently are associated with deltas, estuaries, lagoons, 
  and sheltered bays. Tidal flats of the muddy coast in Asia constitutes the main 
  part of the coastal wetland (Bird, 1992). Large-scale wetland reclamation in 
  the major deltas has taken place during the past few decades (Lang et al., 1998; 
  Liu et al., 1998). Lagoons, which are important wetlands, are located across 
  the coastal regions of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and Russia. 
  The transitional area between uplift and subsidence belts has favored the formation 
  of lagoons along China's coastline (Li and Wang, 1991). These lagoons tend 
  to be decreasing in area as a result of silting of sediments and plant growing 
  (Zhu, 1991). Sea-level rise and reduction of river-borne sediments will decelerate 
  delta progradation and wetland renewal. The rich biodiversity of wetlands in 
  Asia is seriously threatened by loss of wetlands from sea-level rise (Nicholls 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Mangroves are made up of salt-adapted evergreen trees; they are restricted 
  to the intertidal zone along the vast coastlines of tropical countries in Asia 
  and extend landward along tidal rivers. The Sundarbans in Bangladesh and adjacent 
  areas in India, covering about 6,000 km<sup>2</sup>, are the largest mangrove 
  forests in the world (Allison, 1998). Depletion of mangrove forests by anthropogenic 
  pressures has become a serious problem (Farnsworth and Ellison, 1997). Approxmately 
  half of mangrove forests in Thailand were reduced by 56% during 1961-1996. 
  In the Philippines, more than 75% of the mangrove forests have been lost in 
  less than 70 years. Destruction of Indonesia's estimated 44,000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  of mangroves has taken place mainly since 1975 (Middleton, 1999; UNEP, 1999). 
  Mangrove forests are highly vulnerable to climate change-induced sea-level rise 
  because it will change the salinity distribution and hence productivity. Large-scale 
  changes in species composition and zonation in mangrove forests also are expected 
  as a result of changes in sedimentation and organic accumulation, the nature 
  of the coastal profile, and species interaction (Aksornkaoe and Paphavasit, 
  1993).</p>
