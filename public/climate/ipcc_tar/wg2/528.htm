<h3>14.1.5. Summary of Main Findings from the IPCC Special Report on Regional 
  Impacts of Climate Change</h3>
<p>Glaciers in the high Andes and three major ice fields in southern South America 
  represent the cryosphere in Latin America. Warming in high mountain regions 
  could lead to disappearance of significant snow and ice surfaces. In addition, 
  changes in atmospheric circulation resulting from the ENSO phenomenon and climate 
  change could modify snowfall rates&#151;with a direct effect on the seasonal 
  renewal of water supply&#151;and surface and underground runoff in piedmont 
  areas. This could affect mountain sports and tourist activities, which represent 
  an important source of income in some economies. Glaciers are melting at an 
  accelerated rate in the Venezuelan (Schubert, 1992; Hastenrath and Ames, 1995) 
  and Peruvian Andes.</p>
<p>In the humid tropics, extreme precipitation events would increase the number 
  of reservoirs silting up well before their design lives have been reached. Other 
  areas affected by the impact of climate change on water resources could be those 
  that rely on freshwater ecosystems (i.e., lakes and inland wetlands and their 
  biota), including commercial and subsistence fisheries.</p>
<p>According to climate change projections, approximately 70% of the current temperate 
  forest in Mexico could be affected by climate change (Villers, 1995). Other 
  vulnerability studies (Gay-Garc&iacute;a and Ruiz Suarez, 1996)&#151;carried 
  out on the basis of Canadian Climate Centre (CCC)-J1 (Boer <i>et al</i>., 1992; 
  McFarlane <i>et al</i>., 1992; Boer, 1993) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 
  (GFDL)-A3 (Wetherald and Manabe, 1988) GCMs&#151;suggest that 10% of all vegetation 
  types in northern Mexico's ecosystems&#151;including forests and shrublands 
  of southern Chihuahua, eastern Coahuila, northern Zacatecas, and San Luis Potos&igrave;&#151;would 
  be affected by drier and warmer conditions, resulting in expansion of dry and 
  very dry tropical forests and xerophytic shrublands.</p>
<p>Studies of vulnerability to sea-level rise (Perdomo <i>et al.</i>, 1996) have 
  suggested that countries such as Venezuela and Uruguay could suffer adverse 
  impacts, leading to losses of coastal land and biodiversity, saltwater intrusion, 
  and infrastructure damage. Impacts likely would be multiple and complex, with 
  major economic implications. In Central America, impacts associated with sea-level 
  rise would have their greatest effects on infrastructure, agriculture, and natural 
  resources along the coastline, with immediate effects on socioeconomic conditions 
  in the isthmus countries. Sea-level rise would exacerbate the processes of coastal 
  erosion and salinization of aquifers and increase flooding risks and the impacts 
  of severe storms along the coastline (Campos <i>et al</i>., 1997). Flooding 
  associated with sea-level rise is one of the main impacts in lowland areas such 
  as the Amazon, Orinoco, and Parana River deltas and the mouth of other rivers, 
  such as the Magdalena in Colombia. The report also identified the Rio de La 
  Plata estuary as an area where saltwater intrusion could create problems in 
  the freshwater supply. </p>
<p>In Latin America's extremely arid deserts (&lt;100 mm annual precipitation)&#151;the 
  Chihuahuan, Sonoran, Peruvian, Atacama, Monte, and Patagonia&#151;the impacts 
  of climate change are not expected to be severe (Canziani <i>et al</i>., 1998), 
  because these systems already are adapted to wide fluctuations in rainfall. 
  Therefore, hyper-arid lands are not as susceptible as drylands to climate change 
  (Middleton and Thomas, 1997).</p>
<p>Studies developed in Costa Rica and Nicaragua (Halpin <i>et al., </i>1995) 
  observed that shifts may occur in climatic zones that are associated with particular 
  vegetation types in these countries. Global warming would have its greatest 
  impacts on the cold temperate forest of southern Chile and Argentina, especially 
  those neighboring xerophytic ecosystem types.</p>
<p>Projected changes in climate could increase the impacts of already serious 
  chronic malnutrition and diseases affecting a large sector of the Latin American 
  population. The geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria) 
  would spread to higher elevations. </p>
