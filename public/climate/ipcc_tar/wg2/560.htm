<h4><a name="15222"></a>15.2.2.2. Protected Areas</h4>
<h4><a name="152221"></a>15.2.2.2.1. Mountains</h4>
<p>In the 20th century, there has been increasing human pressure on mountainous 
  regions, initially through trapping, forestry, and reservoir construction and 
  now through development of ski areas and other resorts and construction of residences, 
  as well as forestry and continuing reservoir construction in northern Canada. 
  At the same time, however, the national park systems in the United States and 
  Canada and wilderness preserves have expanded to include many mountainous areas 
  that are essentially pristine with respect to human development, especially 
  in the Rocky Mountains. It is now recognized that these protected mountain ecosystems 
  are still vulnerable to anthropogenic change through transport of atmospheric 
  contaminants, such as nitrate and sulfate in acid rain, and through climate 
  change. Warming of the climate eventually will cause two major changes&#151;retreat 
  of mountain glaciers and upward movement of treeline&#151;and the response times 
  for reaching new equilibrium conditions are on the order of 100 years or more, 
  so these responses will lag continuing climate change.</p>
<p>Retreat of glaciers is driven by the rate of ablation, which includes melt, 
  exceeding the rate of advance driven by snow accumulation over the glacier, 
  and corresponds to a change in the shape of the glacier to a new equilibrium. 
  Retreat of mountain glaciers already has begun in North America (Brugman <i>et 
  al</i>., 1997) and in other regions of the world, and this retreat will contribute 
  to sea-level rise in an amount comparable in magnitude to expansion of ocean 
  waters as a result of warming. On a regional scale, the retreat of glaciers 
  will affect water resources by changing (probably decreasing) water supply from 
  glacial melt during summer or changing the spatial location of the melt source 
  [summer flows initially may increase but eventually will decline as glacier 
  reservoir capacity declines (Pelto, 1993)]. Furthermore, glacial retreat will 
  expose terrain that gradually will evolve with soil development and revegetation, 
  and new lakes will form in exposed basins. These changes eventually will influence 
  the water quality of drainage from these lakes. These sequences of glacial advance 
  and retreat have occurred through the quaternary; the effect of climate change 
  is to induce these changes. In terms of human vulnerability to climate change, 
  retreat of mountain glaciers also is significant because it is an observable 
  change that can be directly comprehended by the public as an indicator of warming&#151;more 
  so than warming of the open ocean or an increase in extreme hydrological events. 
  For example, a recent article in a travel magazine (Conde Nast) outlined vacations 
  to view retreating glaciers in North America, Europe, and Africa while they 
  were still there. <br>
</p>
<p>From paleolimnological studies of alpine and subalpine lakes, the rise in treeline 
  in response to past warming of climate is well-documented. The boundary between 
  alpine tundra and subalpine forest is controlled by extremes of temperature, 
  moisture, and wind. Vegetation in both ecosystems is long-lived, and changes 
  will proceed slowly and in a manner that depends on whether total annual snowpack 
  decreases or increases and whether melt occurs earlier; both factors control 
  the growth of alpine and subalpine species. Movement of treeline could have 
  a minor feedback on climate change by sequestering more carbon in subalpine 
  forests. The eventual effect of upward movement of the treeline will be to shrink 
  the extent of alpine tundra in North America, possibly causing species loss 
  and ecosystem degradation through greater fragmentation (see <a href="577.htm">Section 
  15.2.6.</a> and <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="152222"></a>15.2.2.2.2. Wetlands</h4>
<p>Wetlands represent a variety of shallow water and upland water environments 
  that are characterized by hydric soils and plant and animal species that are 
  adapted to life in saturated conditions (NRC, 1995). These ecosystems are considered 
  to be of great importance in a variety of functional contexts, including waterfowl 
  habitat, carbon sequestration, CH<sub>4</sub> production, flood regulation, 
  pollutant removal, and fish and shellfish propagation (Mitsch and Gosselink, 
  1993). About 14% of Canada's surface area is covered by wetlands, which 
  is 24% of the global total (NWWG, 1988). Approximately 6% of the United States 
  is wetland (Kusler <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Mid-latitude wetlands have been greatly affected by a variety of human activities 
  over the past 200 years. More than 50% of the original wetlands in the United 
  States have been destroyed for agriculture, impoundment, road building, and 
  other activities (Dahl, 1990). Most of the remaining wetlands have been altered 
  by harvest, grazing, pollution, hydrological changes, and invasion by exotic 
  species (Kusler <i>et al</i>., 1999). High-latitude wetlands have experienced 
  much lower levels of human disturbance (Schindler, 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change can have significant impacts on wetland structure and function, 
  primarily through alterations in hydrology, especially water-table level (Clair 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Clair and Ehrman, 1998). Wetland flora and fauna respond 
  very dynamically to small changes in water-table levels (Poiani <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; Schindler, 1998). Moreover, climate change can exacerbate other stresses 
  (e.g., pollution), especially in fragmented landscapes where wetlands have been 
  cut off from other wetlands by a variety of landscape-level alterations (Mortsch, 
  1998; Kusler <i>et al</i>., 1999). With rising sea levels, shoreline development 
  and efforts to protect private property from coastal erosion could lead to loss 
  of public tidelands and coastal marshes, particularly along bayshores where 
  preservation of natural shorelines has received less policy attention than is 
  the case for most ocean beaches (Titus, 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Specific changes predicted to occur in North American wetlands are wide ranging. 
  Sea-level rise will result in loss of coastal wetlands in many areas, with potentially 
  important effects on ocean fisheries (Michener <i>et al</i>., 1997; Turner, 
  1997). Increased drought conditions in the Prairie Pothole Region of the northern 
  Great Plains, which are forecast to occur under nearly all GCM scenarios, will 
  significantly reduce U.S. breeding duck populations (Sorenson <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Tourism may benefit from extended seasons but will suffer if key processes 
  (e.g., hunting, birding) are disrupted (Wall, 1998a). Alteration of water-table 
  levels could affect the carbon sequestration function of the vast northern wetlands 
  of Canada, but there is great uncertainty about the nature and extent of this 
  effect (Moore <i>et al</i>., 1998; Waddington <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Wetlands have been the target of numerous protection and restoration efforts 
  (NRC, 1995), which suggests that there is high potential for adaptive management 
  in response to climate change, at least in mid-latitudes. Kusler <i>et al</i>. 
  (1999) recommend a series of strategies for reducing the impacts of climate 
  change on wetlands. These strategies include better control of filling and draining 
  of wetlands, prevention of additional stresses, prevention of additional fragmentation, 
  creation of upland buffers, control of exotic species, protection of low flows 
  and residual water, enhanced efforts to restore and create wetlands, and aggressive 
  efforts in stocking and captive breeding of critical wetland species. Five states 
  in the United States have adopted rolling easement policies, which ensure that 
  wetlands and/or beaches can migrate inland as sea level rises, instead of being 
  squeezed between coastal development and the advancing sea (Titus, 1998). These 
  efforts would be greatly enhanced by creation of regional inventories and management 
  plans for wetlands at greatest risk from climate change.</p>
