      <b>Figure SPM-3:</b> Projected changes in average annual water runoff by 
      2050, relative to average runoff for 1961-1990, largely follow projected 
      changes in precipitation. Changes in runoff are calculated with a hydrologic 
      model using as inputs climate projections from two versions of the Hadley 
      Centre atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) for a scenario 
      of 1% per annum increase in effective carbon dioxide concentration in the 
      atmosphere: (a) HadCM2 ensemble mean and (b) HadCM3. Projected increases 
      in runoff in high latitudes and southeast Asia, and decreases in central 
      Asia, the area around the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and Australia 
      are broadly consistent across the Hadley Centre experiments, and with the 
      precipitation projections of other AOGCM experiments. For other areas of 
      the world, changes in precipitation and runoff are scenario- and model-dependent.

<p><a name="figspm3"></a>The effect of climate change on streamflow and groundwater 
  recharge varies regionally and between climate scenarios, largely following 
  projected changes in precipitation. A consistent projection across most climate 
  change scenarios is for increases in annual mean streamflow in high latitudes 
  and southeast Asia, and decreases in central Asia, the area around the Mediterranean, 
  southern Africa, and Australia (medium confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>) 
  (see <a href="#figspm3">Figure SPM-3</a>); the amount of change, however, varies 
  between scenarios. For other areas, including mid-latitudes, there is no strong 
  consistency in projections of streamflow, partly because of differences in projected 
  rainfall and partly because of differences in projected evaporation, which can 
  offset rainfall increases. The retreat of most glaciers is projected to accelerate, 
  and many small glaciers may disappear (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  In general, the projected changes in average annual runoff are less robust than 
  impacts based solely on temperature change because precipitation changes vary 
  more between scenarios. At the catchment scale, the effect of a given change 
  in climate varies with physical properties and vegetation of catchments, and 
  may be in addition to land-cover changes. [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>Approximately 1.7 billion people, one-third of the world's population, 
  presently live in countries that are water-stressed (defined as using more than 
  20% of their renewable water supply, a commonly used indicator of water stress). 
  This number is projected to increase to around 5 billion by 2025, depending 
  on the rate of population growth. The projected climate change could further 
  decrease the streamflow and groundwater recharge in many of these water-stressed 
  countries&#151;for example in central Asia, southern Africa, and countries around 
  the Mediterranean Sea&#151;but may increase it in some others. [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>; 
  see also <a href="038.htm#511">5.1.1</a>, <a href="041.htm#523">5.2.3</a>, <a href="043.htm">5.3.1</a>, 
  <a href="044.htm#541">5.4.1</a>, <a href="045.htm#551">5.5.1</a>, <a href="046.htm#562">5.6.2</a>, 
  and <a href="048.htm#584">5.8.4</a> for regional-scale information]<br>
</p>
<p>Demand for water is generally increasing due to population growth and economic 
  development, but is falling in some countries because of increased efficiency 
  of use. Climate change is unlikely to have a big effect on municipal and industrial 
  water demands in general, but may substantially affect irrigation withdrawals, 
  which depend on how increases in evaporation are offset or exaggerated by changes 
  in precipitation. Higher temperatures, hence higher crop evaporative demand, 
  mean that the general tendency would be towards an increase in irrigation demands. 
  [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>]</p>
<p>Flood magnitude and frequency could increase in many regions as a consequence 
  of increased frequency of heavy precipitation events, which can increase runoff 
  in most areas as well as groundwater recharge in some floodplains. Land-use 
  change could exacerbate such events. Streamflow during seasonal low flow periods 
  would decrease in many areas due to greater evaporation; changes in precipitation 
  may exacerbate or offset the effects of increased evaporation. The projected 
  climate change would degrade water quality through higher water temperatures 
  and increased pollutant load from runoff and overflows of waste facilities. 
  Quality would be degraded further where flows decrease, but increases in flows 
  may mitigate to a certain extent some degradations in water quality by increasing 
  dilution. Where snowfall is currently an important component of the water balance, 
  a greater proportion of winter precipitation may fall as rain, and this can 
  result in a more intense peak streamflow which in addition would move from spring 
  to winter. [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>The greatest vulnerabilities are likely to be in unmanaged water systems and 
  systems that are currently stressed or poorly and unsustainably managed due 
  to policies that discourage efficient water use and protection of water quality, 
  inadequate watershed management, failure to manage variable water supply and 
  demand, or lack of sound professional guidance. In unmanaged systems there are 
  few or no structures in place to buffer the effects of hydrologic variability 
  on water quality and supply. In unsustainably managed systems, water and land 
  uses can add stresses that heighten vulnerability to climate change. [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>]</p>
<p>Water resource management techniques, particularly hose of integrated water 
  resource management, can be applied to adapt to hydrologic effects of climate 
  change, and to additional uncertainty, so as to lessen vulnerabilities. Currently, 
  supply-side approaches (e.g., increasing flood defenses, building weirs, utilizing 
  water storage areas, including natural systems, improving infrastructure for 
  water collection and distribution) are more widely used than demand-side approaches 
  (which alter the exposure to stress); the latter is the focus of increasing 
  attention. However, the capacity to implement effective management responses 
  is unevenly distributed around the world and is low in many transition and developing 
  countries. [<a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>]</p>
