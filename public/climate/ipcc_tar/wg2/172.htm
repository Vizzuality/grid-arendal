<h3><a name="439"></a>4.3.9. Changes in Hydrological Drought Frequency</h3>
<p>Droughts are considerably more difficult to define in quantitative terms than 
  floods. Droughts may be expressed in terms of rainfall deficits, soil moisture 
  deficits, lack of flow in a river, low groundwater levels, or low reservoir 
  levels; different definitions are used in different sectors. A &#147;hydrological&#148; 
  drought occurs when river or groundwater levels are low, and a &#147;water resources&#148; 
  drought occurs when low river, groundwater, or reservoir levels impact water 
  use. Low river flows in summer may not necessarily create a water resources 
  drought, for example, if reservoirs are full after winter; conversely, a short-lived 
  summer flood may not end a water resources drought caused by a prolonged lack 
  of reservoir inflows. Water resources droughts therefore depend not only on 
  the climatic and hydrological inputs but critically on the characteristics of 
  the water resource system and how droughts are managed. This section focuses 
  on hydrological drought, particularly on low river flows. Different studies 
  have used different indices of low river flows, including the magnitude of minimum 
  flows, the frequency at which flows fall below some threshold, the duration 
  of flow below a threshold, and the cumulative difference between actual flows 
  and some defined threshold. </p>
<p>At the global scale, Arnell (1999b) explored the change in the minimum annual 
  total runoff with a return period of 10 years under several scenarios, based 
  on HadCM2 and HadCM3 GCMs. He shows that the pattern of this measure of &#147;low 
  flow&#148; (which is relatively crude) changes in a similar way to average annual 
  runoff (as shown in <a href="168.htm#fig41">Figure 4-1</a>) but that the percentage 
  changes tend to be larger. Arnell (1999a) mapped a different index of low flow 
  across Europe&#151;the average summed difference between streamflow and the 
  flow exceeded 95% of the time, while flows are below this threshold&#151;under 
  four scenarios. The results suggest a reduction in the magnitude of low flows 
  under most scenarios across much of western Europe, as a result of lower flows 
  during summer, but an amelioration of low flows in the east because of increased 
  winter flows. In these regions, however, the season of lowest flows tends to 
  shift from the current winter low-flow season toward summer.</p>
<p>D&ouml;ll et al. (1999) also modeled global runoff at a spatial resolution 
  of 0.5&deg;x0.5&deg;, not only for average climatic conditions but also for 
  typical dry years. The annual runoff exceeded in 9 years out of 10 (the 10-year 
  return period &#147;drought&#148; runoff) was derived for each of more than 
  1,000 river basins covering the whole globe. Then the impact of climate change 
  on these runoff values was computed by scaling observed temperature and precipitation 
  in the 1-in-10 dry years with climate scenarios of two different GCMs (Chapter 
  3), ECHAM4/OPYC3 and GFDL-R15. Climate variability was assumed to remain constant. 
  For the same GHG emission scenario, IS92a, the two GCMs compute quite different 
  temperature and more so precipitation changes. With the GFDL scenario, runoff 
  in 2025 and 2075 is simulated to be higher in most river basins than with the 
  ECHAM scenario. The 1-in-10 dry year runoff is computed to decrease between 
  the present time (1961&#150;1990 climate) and 2075 by more than 10% on 19% (ECHAM) 
  or 13% (GFDL) of the global land area (<a href="171.htm#tab44">Table 4-4</a>) 
  and to increase by more than 50% on 22% (ECHAM) or 49% (GFDL) of the global 
  land area. These results underline the high sensitivity of computed future runoff 
  changes to GCM calculations.</p>
<p>There have been several other studies into changes in low flow indicators at 
  the catchment scale. Gellens and Roulin (1998), for example, simulated changes 
  in low flows in several Belgian catchments under a range of GCM-based scenarios. 
  They show how the same scenario could produce rather different changes in different 
  catchments, depending largely on the catchment geological conditions. Catchments 
  with large amounts of groundwater storage tend to have higher summer flows under 
  the climate change scenarios considered because additional winter rainfall tends 
  to lead to greater groundwater recharge (the extra rainfall offsets the shorter 
  recharge season). Low flows in catchments with little storage tend to be reduced 
  because these catchments do not feel the benefits of increased winter recharge. 
  Arnell and Reynard (1996) found similar results in the UK. The effect of climate 
  change on low flow magnitudes and frequency therefore can be considered to be 
  very significantly affected by catchment geology (and, indeed, storage capacity 
  in general). Dvorak et al. (1997) also showed how changes in low flow measures 
  tend to be proportionately greater than changes in annual, seasonal, or monthly 
  flows.</p>
