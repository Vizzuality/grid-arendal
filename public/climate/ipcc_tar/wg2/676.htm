<h2>19.5. Aggregate Impacts </h2>
<p>The third reason for concern relates to the overall (i.e., worldwide or aggregate) 
  economic and ecological implications of climate change. Numerous studies have 
  addressed aggregate impacts, particularly in the context of integrated assessment. 
</p>
<h3><a name="1951"></a>19.5.1. Aggregate Analysis: An Assessment</h3>
<p>Estimating the aggregate impact of climate change is an intricate task that 
  requires careful professional judgment and skills. Aggregate analysis is based 
  on the same tools as most distributional analysis and uses regional data as 
  inputs. Consequently, it shares with distributional analysis the methodological 
  difficulties and shortcomings discussed more fully in <a href="673.htm">Section 
  19.4</a>:</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Choice of an appropriate (set of) numeraire(s) in which to express impacts<br>
  <li> Need to overcome knowledge gaps and scientific uncertainties to provide 
    a comprehensive picture<br>
  <li> Difficulties in modeling the effects of adaptation<br>
  <li> Difficulties in forecasting baseline developments (such as economic and 
    population growth, technical progress).
</ul>
<p>In addition, analysts have to grapple with some issues that are generic to 
  aggregate analysis. The most important issue is spatial and temporal comparison 
  of impacts. Aggregating impacts requires an understanding of (or assumptions 
  about) the relative importance of impacts in different sectors, in different 
  regions, and at different times. Developing this understanding implicitly involves 
  value judgments. The task is simplified if impacts can be expressed in a common 
  metric, but even then aggregation is not possible without value judgments. The 
  value judgments that underlie regional aggregation are discussed and made explicit 
  in Azar and Sterner (1996), Fankhauser et al. (1997, 1998), and Azar (1999). 
  Aggregation across time and the issue of discounting are discussed in more detail 
  in <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/266.htm">Chapter 7</a>. Aggregate 
  impact estimates can be very sensitive to the aggregation method and the choice 
  of numeraire (see <a href="054.htm">Chapter 1</a>).</p>
<p>All of these factors make aggregate analysis difficult to carry out and reduce 
  our overall confidence in aggregate results. Nevertheless, aggregate studies 
  provide important and policy-relevant information.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="1952"></a>19.5.2. Insights and Lessons: The Static Picture</h3>
<p>Most impact studies assess the consequences of climate change at a particular 
  concentration level or a particular point in time, thereby providing a static 
  "snapshot" of an evolving, dynamic process. The SAR suggested that 
  the aggregate impact of 2xCO<sub>2</sub>&#151;expressed in monetary terms&#151;might 
  be equivalent to 1.5-2.0% of world GDP. Estimated damages are slightly 
  lower (relative to GDP) in developed countries but significantly higher in developing 
  countries&#151;particularly in small island states and other highly vulnerable 
  countries, where impacts could be catastrophic (Pearce et al., 1996). The SAR 
  was careful, however, to point out the low quality of these numbers and the 
  many shortcomings of the underlying studies. </p>
<p>Since publication of the SAR, our understanding of aggregate impacts has improved, 
  but it remains limited. Some sectors and impacts have received more analytical 
  attention than others and as a result are better understood. Agricultural and 
  coastal impacts in particular are now well studied (see <a href="673.htm#box192">Boxes 
  19-2</a> and <a href="674.htm#box193">19-3</a>). Knowledge about the health 
  impacts of climate change also is growing (see <a href="674.htm#box194">Box 
  19-4</a>). Several attempts have been made to identify other nonmarket impacts, 
  such as changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecological systems and ecosystem 
  services, but a clear and consistent quantification has not yet emerged. </p>
<p><a href="675.htm#tab194">Table 19-4</a> contains a summary of results from 
  aggregate studies that use money as their numeraire. The numerical results as 
  such remain speculative, but they can provide insights on signs, orders of magnitude, 
  and patterns of vulnerability. Results are difficult to compare because different 
  studies assume different climate scenarios, make different assumptions about 
  adaptation, use different regional disaggregation, and include different impacts. 
  The estimates by Nordhaus and Boyer (2000), for example, are more negative than 
  others because they factor in the possibility of catastrophic impact. The estimates 
  by Mendelsohn et al. (2000), on the other hand, are driven by optimistic assumptions 
  about adaptive capacity and baseline development trends, which result in mostly 
  beneficial impacts. </p>
<p>Standard deviations rarely are reported, but they are likely to be several 
  times larger than the "best guess." They are larger for developing countries, 
  where results generally are derived through extrapolation rather than direct 
  estimation. This is illustrated by the standard deviations estimated by Tol 
  (2001b), also reproduced in <a href="675.htm#tab194">Table 19-4</a>. These estimates 
  probably still underestimate the true uncertainty&#151;for example, because 
  they exclude omitted impacts and severe climate change scenarios. Note that 
  the aggregation can mask large standard deviations in estimates of damages to 
  individual sectors (Rothman, 2000). </p>
<p>An alternative indicator of climate change impact (excluding ecosystems) is 
  the number of people affected. Few studies directly calculate this figure, but 
  it is possible to compare the population of regions experiencing negative impacts 
  with that of positively affected regions. Such calculations suggest that a majority 
  of people may be negatively affected already at average global warming of 1-2&deg;C. 
  This may be true even if the net aggregate monetary impact is positive because 
  developed economies, many of which could have positive impacts, contribute the 
  majority of global production but account for a smaller fraction of world population. 
  The quality of estimates of affected population is still poor, however. They 
  are essentially "back-of-the envelope" extensions of monetary models, 
  and the qualifications outlined in that context also apply here. In addition, 
  they do not consider the distribution of positive and negative effects within 
  countries.</p>
<p>On the whole, our confidence in the numerical results of aggregate studies 
  remains low. Nevertheless, a few generic patterns and trends are emerging in 
  which we have more confidence: </p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Market impacts are estimated to be lower than initially thought and in 
    some cases are estimated to be positive, at least in developed countries. 
    The downward adjustment is largely a result of the effect of adaptation, which 
    is more fully (although far from perfectly) captured in the latest estimates. 
    Efficient adaptation reduces the net costs of climate change because the cost 
    of such measures is lower than the concomitant reduction in impacts. However, 
    impact uncertainty and lack of capacity may make efficient and error-free 
    adaptation difficult. <br>
  <li> Nonmarket impacts are likely to be pronounced, and many (but not all) of 
    the effects that have not yet been quantified could be negative. In particular, 
    there is concern about the impact on human health and mortality. Although 
    few studies have taken adequate account of adaptation, the literature suggests 
    substantial negative health impacts in developing countries, mainly because 
    of insufficient basic health care (e.g., Martens et al., 1997). There also 
    is concern about the impact on water resources (e.g., Arnell, 1999; Frederick 
    and Schwarz, 1999) and ecosystems (e.g., Markham, 1996; White et al., 1999). 
    <br>
  <li> "Horizontal" interlinkages such as the interplay between different 
    impact categories (e.g., water supply and agriculture), the effect of stress 
    factors that are not related to climate, adaptation, and exogenous development 
    trends are crucial determinants of impact but have not been fully considered 
    in many studies.<br>
  <li> Estimates of global impact are sensitive to the way numbers are aggregated. 
    Because the most severe impacts are expected in developing countries, aggregate 
    impacts are more severe and thus more weight is assigned to developing countries. 
    Using a simple summing of impacts, some studies estimate small net positive 
    impacts at a few degrees of warming; others estimate small net negative impacts. 
    Net aggregate benefits do not preclude the possibility that a majority of 
    people will be negatively affected&#151;some of them severely so.
</ul>
<p>Overall, the current generation of aggregate estimates may understate the true 
  cost of climate change because they tend to ignore extreme weather events, underestimate 
  the compounding effect of multiple stresses, and ignore the costs of transition 
  and learning. However, studies also may have overlooked positive impacts of 
  climate change. Our current understanding of (future) adaptive capacity, particularly 
  in developing countries, is too limited, and the treatment of adaptation in 
  current studies is too varied, to allow a firm conclusion about the direction 
  of the estimation bias.</p>
