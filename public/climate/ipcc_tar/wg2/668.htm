<h3>19.3.3. Biological Systems </h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href="663.htm">Section 19.2</a>, change in climate already 
  appears to be affecting many biological systems. Continued climate changes can 
  threaten a large number of unique biological systems. This section identifies 
  specific characteristics of some of the most unique and threatened systems, 
  which explain why many are at risk from climate change. In addition, some specific 
  examples of unique and threatened biological systems are presented. Many others 
  also are threatened by climate change; these are discussed in detail in other 
  chapters of this report. Examples of natural systems that may be threatened 
  include montane ecosystems that are restricted to upper 200-300 m of mountainous 
  areas, prairie wetlands, remnant native grasslands, coldwater and some coolwater 
  fish habitat, ecosystems that overlie permafrost, and ice-edge ecosystems that 
  provide habitat for polar bears and penguins. Examples of species that may be 
  threatened by changes in climate include forest birds in Tanzania, the resplendent 
  quetzal in Central America, the mountain gorilla in Africa, amphibians that 
  are endemic to the cloud forests of the neotropics, and the spectacled bear 
  of the Andes. </p>
<h4><a name="19331"></a>19.3.3.1. Risks to Species and Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that climate plays a strong 
  role in limiting the ranges of species and ecosystems. Species already are responding 
  to changes in regional climate, with altered population sizes and breeding times 
  or flowering dates that occur earlier in the season (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>). These responses suggest that many unique species will undergo complex 
  changes with a few degrees of warming, which could lead to extinction in many 
  locations. Such species can be found across various regions (see <a href="667.htm#tab191">Table 
  19-1</a>). Other chapters in this report list many examples (see <a href="#tab192">Table 
  19-2</a>). However, projecting possible responses of wild animal and plant species 
  is extremely difficult for most species because there are many possible biological 
  interactions and confounding factors, such as habitat destruction and invasive 
  species.</p>
<p>Species that make up a natural community, however, most likely will not shift 
  together (Davis, 1986; Overpeck et al., 1994; Root, 2000). This could break 
  apart established natural communities and create newly evolving assemblages. 
  Depending on the magnitude and duration of the environmental disturbance, some 
  or all individuals of a given species may shift out of an area. This, in turn, 
  can cause a local (or even the overall) population size to decline. Superimposed 
  on these potential changes are those caused by land-use change, which frequently 
  fragments populations into patches throughout their ranges.</p>

<p>Species with wide nonpatchy ranges, rapid dispersal mechanisms, and a large 
  population normally are not in danger of extinction [e.g., European house sparrow 
  (Passer domesticus) and many weedy plant species]. Those with narrow patchy 
  ranges and small populations frequently are endangered and may require management 
  for survival [e.g., most crane species (Gruidea spp.)]. In summary, species 
  tend to become rarer when ranges shift from wide to narrow, available habitat 
  becomes patchier, and population size declines (Huntley et al., 1997). Indeed, 
  a species is likely to become extinct if it is forced into a narrow patchy range 
  and its population declines&#151;a probability that is enhanced when environmental 
  disturbances such as climate change, along with companion transient changes, 
  occur.</p>
<p>Even when conservation management of rare species is effective, survival still 
  may be problematic because in a small population, genetically similar individuals 
  may breed, which decreases genetic variability. This, in turn, may reduce adaptability 
  to stresses, thereby further lowering population size and decreasing the types 
  of habitat within which the species could survive. Environmental catastrophes 
  such as hurricanes, oil spills, extreme temperatures, and drought can trigger 
  the extinction of even well-managed rare species. The only way to reduce the 
  risk of extinction brought about by catastrophes is to increase population sizes 
  and maintain corridors between isolated populations. </p>
