<h4>Natural Resources</h4>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Forests</h4>
<p>Climate change is expected to increase the areal extent and productivity of 
  forests over the next 50-100 years (medium confidence). Extreme and/or 
  long-term climate change scenarios indicate the possibility of widespread decline 
  (low confidence).</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to cause changes in the nature and extent of several 
  "disturbance factors" (e.g., fire, insect outbreaks) (medium confidence). 
  Of particular interest in North America are changes in fire regimes, including 
  an earlier start to the fire season, and significant increases in the area experiencing 
  high to extreme fire danger. The long-term effects of fire will depend heavily 
  on changes in human fire management activities, which are uncertain, especially 
  in remote boreal forests. </p>
<p>There is a strong need for a long-term comprehensive system to monitor forest 
  "health" and disturbance regimes over regional scales that can function 
  as an early warning system for climate change effects on forests.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Protected Areas </h4>
<p>Climate change can lead to loss of specific ecosystem types, such as high alpine 
  areas and specific coastal (e.g., salt marshes) and inland (e.g., prairie "potholes") 
  wetland types (high confidence). There is moderate potential for adaptation 
  to prevent these losses by planning conservation programs to identify and protect 
  particularly threatened ecosystems.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Food and Fiber </h4>
<h4><a name="7"></a>Agriculture</h4>
<p>Food production is projected to benefit from a warmer climate, but there probably 
  will be strong regional effects, with some areas in North America suffering 
  significant loss of comparative advantage to other regions (high confidence). 
  There is potential for increased drought in the U.S. Great Plains/Canadian Prairies 
  and opportunities for a limited northward shift in production areas in Canada 
  (high confidence). Crop yield studies for the United States and Canada have 
  indicated a wide range of impacts. Modeled yield results that include direct 
  physiological effects of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), with sufficient water 
  and nutrients, are substantially different from those that do not account for 
  such effects. Economic studies that include farm- and agricultural market-level 
  adjustments (e.g., behavioral, economic, and institutional) indicate that the 
  negative effects of climate change on agriculture probably have been overestimated 
  by studies that do not account for these adjustments (medium confidence). However, 
  the ability of farmers to adapt their input and output choices will depend on 
  market and institutional signals, which may be partially influenced by climate 
  change.</p>
<h4><a name="8"></a>Production Forestry</h4>
<p>Lands that are managed for timber production are likely to be less susceptible 
  to climate change than unmanaged forests because of the potential for adaptive 
  management. However, when the possibility of replanting with incorrect species 
  is considered, economic impacts could become negative.</p>
<h4><a name="9"></a>Carbon Sequestration&#151;Adaptation Issues</h4>
<p>Increased interest in agricultural sinks for carbon sequestration includes 
  proposed use of reduced-tillage practices in North America. Negative consequences 
  may include increased use of pesticides, reduced yields, and increased risk 
  for farmers (medium confidence). Potential benefits include reduced input costs, 
  increased soil moisture, and reduced soil erosion (high confidence). </p>
