<h3>11.4.2. Future Needs </h3>
<p>The early signs of climate change already observed in some parts of Asia and 
  elsewhere may become more prominent over the period of 1 or 2 decades. If this 
  time is not used appropriately, it may be too late to avoid upheavals and significant 
  human impacts for some nations. Climate change could lead either to cooperation 
  or to conflict over the world's major resources. Integrated planning may 
  be the greatest global challenge, now motivated by the potential for environmental 
  and social transformation caused by climate change.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, Asian countries will have to produce more food and other 
  agricultural commodities under conditions of diminishing per capita arable land 
  and irrigation water resources and expanding biotic as well as abiotic stresses, 
  including climatic constraints. The dual demands for food and ecological security 
  would have to be based on appropriate use of biotechnology, information technology, 
  and ecotechnology. Practical achievements in bringing about the desired paradigm 
  shift in sustainable agriculture will depend on public policy support and political 
  action. Critical areas for intervention would be: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving the availability of seed/planting material of high-yielding varieties<br>
  </li>
  <li>Developing and promoting the use of hybrids, especially for rainfed agro-ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>Expanding areas under different crops and commodities, through diversification 
    of agriculture<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improving the productivity of crops, existing plantations, and livestock<br>
  </li>
  <li>Developing infrastructure for post-harvest management, marketing, and agribusiness<br>
  </li>
  <li>Small farm mechanisms<br>
  </li>
  <li>Transfer of technological inputs through assessments and refinements at 
    regular time intervals in consonance with our understanding of climate variability 
    and climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring food security may remain an unaccomplished dream for many Asian countries 
  unless appropriate strategies are put in place to ensure environmental and ecological 
  protection and conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>The food security issue is highly dependent on equitable guaranteed access 
  to foods. Equitable access is highly differentiated across populations in the 
  agrarian nations of Asia. This situation is further aggravated by natural disasters 
  such as floods and droughts, which are known to have caused great famines in 
  south Asian countries. Poverty in many south Asian countries seems to be the 
  cause of not only hunger but even lack of shelter, access to clean drinking 
  water, illiteracy, ill health, and other forms of human deprivation. Opportunities 
  for assured and remunerative marketing at microenterprise levels should promote 
  equitable use of available food resources. </p>
<p>In view of present uncertainties over the pace and magnitude of climate change, 
  the most promising policy options are those for which benefits accrue even if 
  no climate change takes place. Such policy actions include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breeding of new crop varieties and species (heat- and salt-tolerant crops, 
    low-water-use crops)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Maintenance of seed banks, liberalization of trade of agricultural commodities, 
    flexibility of commodity support programs, agricultural drought management<br>
  </li>
  <li>Promotion of efficiency of irrigation and water use and dissemination of 
    conservation management practices<br>
  </li>
  <li>Trans-national cooperation to promote sustainable water resources management 
    and flood risk management<br>
  </li>
  <li>Rehabilitation of degraded forests and watersheds (such strategies can enhance 
    biodiversity conservation and provide source of livelihood for many poor forest 
    and upland watershed dwellers)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Strengthening of biophysical and socioeconomic resources and resource use-related 
    databases for natural and social systems and focused research to further our 
    understanding of the climate-ecosystem-social system interaction. Data and 
    information generated through these activities will be useful not only for 
    designing appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures but also for management 
    planning and decisionmaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The climate change issue has presented decisionmakers in Asian countries with 
  a set of formidable complications: a considerable number of uncertainties (which 
  are inherent in the complexity of the problem), the potential for irreversible 
  damages to ecosystems, a very long planning horizon, long time lags between 
  GHG emissions and effects, wide regional variation in causes and effects, the 
  global scope of the problem, and the need to consider multiple GHGs and aerosols. 
  The value of better information about climate change processes and impacts and 
  responses to arrest these risks is likely to be great. A prudent strategy to 
  deal with climate change would be to collectively reduce emission levels of 
  GHGs through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation and adaptation measures. 
  The agriculture and forestry sectors in several countries of Asia have a large 
  GHG mitigation potential that should make a significant contribution to this 
  strategy. </p>
<p>The principle of sustainable development must guide all future development 
  strategies in developing and developed countries of Asia. Serious efforts toward 
  promoting innovative research on efficient technology options and creative environmental 
  literacy are needed while Asian countries adapt to new environmental policies 
  and programs. The challenge lies in identifying opportunities that would facilitate 
  sustainable development by making use of existing technologies and developing 
  policies that make climate-sensitive sectors resilient to climate variability. 
  This strategy will require developing countries in Asia to have more access 
  to appropriate technologies, information, and adequate financing. In addition, 
  adaptation will require anticipation and planning; failure to prepare systems 
  for projected change in climate means, variability, and extremes could lead 
  to capital-intensive development of infrastructures or technologies that are 
  ill-suited to future conditions, as well as missed opportunities to lower the 
  cost of adaptation.</p>
