<h3>4.8.3. Adapting to Climate Change</h3>
<p>Water managers are beginning to consider adapting to climate change. Some&#151;but 
  not all&#151;water management plans and infrastructure have long lead times 
  and long design lives. Improved understanding of the &#147;science&#148; of 
  climate change impacts in the water sector is important but is not in itself 
  enough to enable efficient adaptation. This is because it will never be feasible 
  to base decisions on just one future climate scenario, particularly for time 
  horizons greater than a decade. This is partly a result of incomplete knowledge 
  but largely because of inherent uncertainty in future emissions of GHGs. Therefore, 
  water managers always will be dealing with a range of scenarios, and research 
  aimed at enabling efficient adaptation consequently must focus largely on appropriate 
  analytical and management tools to cope with uncertainty and change rather than 
  on &#147;improving&#148; climate change science and scenarios per se. In some 
  aspects of water management&#151;particularly associated with water quality&#151;scientific 
  research into processes is fundamental to allowing efficient adaptation.</p>
<p>Efficient adaptation to climate change in the water sector requires effort 
  in five main areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data for monitoring. Adaptive water management requires reliable data on 
    which to make decisions, calibrate models, and develop projections for the 
    future. These data should cover not just hydrological characteristics but 
    also indicators of water use.</li>
  <li>Understanding patterns of variability. An understanding of patterns of variability&#151;in 
    particular, the stability of a &#147;baseline&#148; climate&#151;is important 
    for medium-term water management. It is increasingly recognized that even 
    in the absence of climate change, the recent past may not be a reliable guide 
    to the hydrological resource base of the near future.</li>
  <li>Analytical tools. Effective water management requires numerous tools to 
    assess options and the future. These tools include scenario analysis and risk 
    analysis, which are used in some parts of water management but currently are 
    by no means widespread.</li>
  <li>Decision tools. Scenario and risk analysis provides information on possible 
    futures and their consequences. They must be supplemented with tools such 
    as Bayesian and other decisionmaking tools to make decisions on the basis 
    of the information provided. Again, techniques for decisionmaking under uncertainty 
    are not widely used in water management at present, and some of the approaches 
    being used are not very sophisticated.</li>
  <li>Management techniques. These are the techniques that are actually implemented 
    to meet management objectives. The broad spectrum of techniques (such as building 
    a reservoir or managing demand) is well known, but there is a need for research 
    into specific aspects of many demand-side approaches in particular, as well 
    as into opportunities for seasonal flow forecasting and innovative water supply 
    and treatment technologies (such as desalination). It also is necessary to 
    undertake research to determine how to enhance the range of techniques considered 
    by water managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the above efforts are needed to improve water management even in 
  the absence of climate change, and there is an overarching need to improve the 
  exchange of information between hydrological science and water managers.</p>
<p>Water managers have long been accustomed to dealing with change, although until 
  recently this has been primarily change resulting from changes in demand and 
  altered legislative or statutory requirements. Climate change does not in itself 
  stimulate development of new adaptive strategies, but it encourages a more adaptive, 
  incremental, risk-based approach to water management. More precisely, it provides 
  further encouragement for a trend that already is gathering pace.</p>
