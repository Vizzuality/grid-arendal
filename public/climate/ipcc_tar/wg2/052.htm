<h3>7.2.4. Extreme Weather Events</h3>
<p>Many climatic impacts are related to extreme weather events, and the same will 
  hold for the impacts of climate change. The large damage potential of extreme 
  events arises from their severity, suddenness, and unpredictability, which makes 
  them difficult to adapt to. Development patterns can increase vulnerability 
  to extreme events. For example, large development along coastal regions increases 
  exposure to storm surges and tropical cyclones, increasing vulnerability.</p>
<p>The frequency and magnitude of many extreme climate events increase even with 
  a small temperature increase and will become greater at higher temperatures 
  (high confidence). Extreme events include, for example, floods, soil moisture 
  deficits, tropical cyclones, storms, high temperatures, and fires. The impacts 
  of extreme events often are large locally and could strongly affect specific 
  sectors and regions. Increases in extreme events can cause critical design or 
  natural thresholds to be exceeded, beyond which the magnitude of impacts increases 
  rapidly (high confidence). Multiple nonextreme consecutive events also can be 
  problematic because they can lessen adaptive capacity by depleting reserves 
  of insurance and reinsurance companies. [<a href="321.htm">8</a>, <a href="680.htm#19631">19.6.3.1</a>]</p>
<p>An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events would have adverse 
  effects throughout sectors and regions. Agriculture and water resources may 
  be particularly vulnerable to changes in hydrological and temperature extremes. 
  Coastal infrastructure and ecosystems may be adversely affected by changes in 
  the occurrence of tropical cyclones and storm surges. Heat-related mortality 
  is likely to increase with higher temperatures; cold-related mortality is likely 
  to decrease. Floods may lead to the spread of water-related and vector-borne 
  diseases, particularly in developing countries. Many of the monetary damages 
  from extreme events will have repercussions on a broad scale of financial institutions, 
  from insurers and reinsurers to investors, banks, and disaster relief funds. 
  Changes in the statistics of extreme events have implications for the design 
  criteria of engineering applications (e.g., levee banks, bridges, building design, 
  and zoning), which are based on estimates of return periods, and for assessment 
  of the economic performance and viability of particular enterprises that are 
  affected by weather. [<a href="680.htm#19631">19.6.3.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="725"></a>7.2.5. Large-Scale Singular Events</h3>
<p>Human-induced climate change has the potential to trigger large-scale changes 
  in Earth systems that could have severe consequences at regional or global scales. 
  The probabilities of triggering such events are poorly understood but should 
  not be ignored, given the severity of their consequences. Events of this type 
  that might be triggered include complete or partial shutdown of the North Atlantic 
  and Antarctic Deep Water formation, disintegration of the West Antarctic and 
  Greenland Ice Sheets, and major perturbations of biosphere-regulated carbon 
  dynamics. Determining the timing and probability of occurrence of large-scale 
  discontinuities is difficult because these events are triggered by complex interactions 
  between components of the climate system. The actual discontinuous impact could 
  lag the trigger by decades to centuries. These triggers are sensitive to the 
  magnitude and rate of climate change. Large temperature increases have the potential 
  to lead to large-scale discontinuities in the climate system (medium confidence).</p>
<p>These discontinuities could cause severe impacts on the regional and even global 
  scale, but indepth impact analyses are still lacking. Several climate model 
  simulations show complete shutdown of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation 
  with high warming. Although complete shutdown may take several centuries to 
  occur, regional shutdown of convection and significant weakening of the thermohaline 
  circulation may take place within the next century. If this were to occur, it 
  could lead to a rapid regional climate change in the North Atlantic region, 
  with major societal and ecosystem impacts. Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice 
  Sheet would lead to a global sea-level rise of several meters, which may be 
  very difficult to adapt to. Although the disintegration might take many hundreds 
  of years, this process could be triggered irreversibly in the next century. 
  The relative magnitude of feedback processes involved in cycling of carbon through 
  the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere is shown to be distorted by increasing 
  temperatures. Saturation and decline of the net sink effect of the terrestrial 
  biosphere&#151;which is projected to occur over the next century&#151;in step 
  with similar processes, could lead to dominance of positive feedbacks over negative 
  ones and strong amplification of the warming trend. [<a href="681.htm">19.6.3.2</a>]</p>
