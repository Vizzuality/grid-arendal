<h4><a name="162821"></a>16.2.8.2.1. Oil and gas extraction</h4>
<p>Exploration, production, transportation, and associated construction of processing 
  facilities are likely to be affected by climatic change (Maxwell, 1997). Changes 
  in a large number of climate and related variables will affect on- and offshore 
  oil and gas operations. Use of oil drilling structures or ice-strengthened drillships 
  designed to resist ice, use of the ice itself as a drilling platform, and construction 
  of artificial islands are likely to give way to more conventional drilling techniques 
  employed in ice-free waters (Maxwell, 1997). These likely changes are not without 
  concerns. Although the use of regular drillships may reduce operating costs 
  by as much as 50% (Croasdale, 1993), increased wave action, storm surges, and 
  coastal erosion may necessitate design changes to conventional offshore and 
  coastal facilities (McGillivray <i>et al</i>., 1993; Anderson and DiFrancesco, 1997). 
  This may increase the costs of pipeline construction because extensive trenching 
  may be needed to combat the effects of coastal instability and erosion, especially 
  that caused by permafrost melting (Croasdale, 1993; Maxwell, 1997). Design needs 
  for onshore oil and gas facilities and winter roads are strongly linked to accelerated 
  permafrost instability and flooding. The impact of climate change is likely 
  to lead to increased costs in the industry associated with design and operational 
  changes (Maxwell, 1997).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="162822"></a>16.2.8.2.2. Buildings and industrial facilities </h4>
<p>The capacity of permafrost to support buildings, pipelines, and roads has decreased 
  with atmospheric warming, so pilings fail to support even insulated structures 
  (Weller and Lange, 1999). The problem is particularly severe in the Russian 
  Federation, where a large number of five-story buildings constructed in the 
  permanent permafrost zone between 1950 and 1990 already are weakened or damaged, 
  probably as a result of climate change (Khroustalev, 1999). For example, a 2&deg;C 
  rise in soil temperature in the Yakutsk region has led to a decrease of 50% 
  in the bearing capacity of frozen ground under buildings. Khroustalev (1999) 
  has predicted that by 2030, most buildings in cities such as Tiksi and Yakutsk 
  will be lost, unless protective measures are taken. The impact of warming is 
  likely to lead to increased building costs, at least in the short term, as new 
  designs are produced that cope with permafrost instability. Snow loads and wind 
  strengths may increase, which also would require modifications to existing building 
  codes (Maxwell, 1997). There will be reduced demand for heating energy with 
  warmer climate (Anisimov, 1999).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="162823"></a>16.2.8.2.3. Transportation and communications </h4>
<p>The impact of climate warming on transportation and communications in Arctic 
  regions is likely to be considerable. Within and between most polar countries, 
  air transport by major commercial carriers is widely used to move people and 
  freight. Irrespective of climate warming, the number of scheduled flights in 
  polar regions is likely to increase. This will require an adequate infrastructure 
  over designated routes, including establishment of suitable runways, roads, 
  buildings, and weather stations. These installations will require improved engineering 
  designs to cope with permafrost instability. Because paved and snow-plowed roads 
  and airfield runways tend to absorb heat, the mean annual surface temperature 
  may rise by 1-6&deg;C, and this warming may exacerbate climate-driven permafrost 
  instability (Maxwell, 1997). Cloud cover, wind speeds and direction, and patterns 
  of precipitation may be expected to change at the regional level in response 
  to global warming. At present, the density of weather stations is relatively 
  low in Arctic regions. Increased air (and shipping) travel under a changing 
  climate will require a more extensive weather recording network and navigational 
  aids than now exists.<br>
</p>
<p>The impact of climate warming on marine systems is predicted to lead to loss 
  of sea ice and opening of sea routes such as the Northeast and Northwest passages. 
  Ships will be able to use these routes without strengthened hulls. There will 
  be new opportunities for shipping associated with movement of resources (oil, 
  gas, minerals, timber), freight, and people (tourists). However, improved navigational 
  aids will be needed, and harbor facilities probably will have to be developed. 
  The increase in shipping raises questions of maritime law that will need to 
  be resolved quickly. These issues include accident and collision insurance, 
  which authority is responsible for removal of oil or toxic material in the event 
  of a spill, and which authority or agency pays expenses incurred in an environmental 
  cleanup. These questions are important because sovereignty over Arctic waters 
  is disputed among polar nations, and increased ship access could raise many 
  destabilizing international issues. Increased storm surges are predicted that 
  will affect transport schedules. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="162824"></a>16.2.8.2.4. Pollution associated with increased economic 
  activity </h4>
<p>There already are a large number of case studies in the Arctic that indicate 
  the effects of different pollutants on terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems 
  (Crawford, 1997). In the event of increased industrial activity (e.g., mining, 
  oil and gas extraction) under climate warming, new codes will be needed for 
  retention of toxic wastes and to limit emissions of pollutants from processing 
  plants. In the oil industry, considerable progress has been made in revegetating 
  disturbed and polluted sites (McKendrick, 1997), often with plant species that 
  can survive at northern sites under climatic warming. Changes in hydrology, 
  possible increases in catchment rates, and melting of ice may result in wider 
  dispersion of pollutants from accidents. Current ice cover and the low productivity 
  of Arctic lakes restrict sequestration of contaminants (Barrie <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Gregor <i>et al</i>., 1998). Projected changes to ice cover and the hydrology 
  of these lakes may cause them to become greater sinks for river-borne contaminants, 
  similar to those in more temperate regions. In the Arctic Ocean, many persistent 
  organic pollutants (e.g., hexachlorocyclohexane) are trapped under ice as "ghosts 
  of the past" (de March <i>et al</i>., 1998). Reductions in sea-ice cover 
  may speed their introduction to the Arctic food chain and pose risks for the 
  human population. Long-lived apex consumers with high lipid content have a high 
  potential for long-term accumulation of contaminants (Alexander, 1995; Tynan 
  and DeMaster, 1997), and not all of these pollutants are derived within the 
  Arctic. Development of Arctic haze is thought to result from aerosol loading 
  (primarily sulfate particles) of the atmosphere in mid-latitude regions. These 
  particles are then carried northward to the Arctic. The haze is most pronounced 
  in the winter because the particles have a longer residence time in the stable 
  Arctic air masses at that time of year. The increased presence of sulfate particles 
  in the atmosphere is of concern because of their ability to reduce the flow 
  of energy through the atmosphere to the Earth's surface (Shaw, 1987). </p>
