<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <b>How Useful have Scenarios Been 
in Past Impact and Adaptation Assessments? </b>
<p>Study of past assessments has highlighted problems of compatibility in the 
  development and application of scenarios. These problems include difficulties 
  in obtaining credible and compatible projections over long time horizons across 
  different scientific disciplines, inconsistencies in scenarios adopted and their 
  methods of application between different impact assessments, and time lags between 
  reporting of recent climate science and the use of this science in developing 
  scenarios for impact assessment. Furthermore, the use of nonclimatic scenarios 
  at the regional level, alongside more conventional climate scenarios, is only 
  a relatively recent introduction to impact assessment, and methods of scenario 
  development (especially of socioeconomic scenarios) still are at a rudimentary 
  level. </p>
<b>Scenarios of the 21st Century</b> 
<p>The IPCC recently completed the <i>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios </i>(SRES) 
  to replace the earlier set of six IS92 scenarios developed for the IPCC in 1992. 
  These new scenarios consider the period 1990-2100 and include a range of 
  socioeconomic assumptions [e.g., a global population by 2100 of 7.0-15.1 
  billion; average gross domestic product (GDP) of $197-550 trillion (1990 
  US$)]. Their implications for other aspects of global change also have been 
  calculated. For example, mean ground-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in July 
  over the industrialized continents of the northern hemisphere are projected 
  to rise from about 40 ppb in 2000 to more than 70 ppb in 2100 under the highest 
  illustrative SRES emissions scenarios. Estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration range 
  from 478 to 1099 ppm by 2100, accounting for the range of SRES emissions and 
  uncertainties about the carbon cycle. This range of implied radiative forcing 
  gives rise to an estimated global warming from 1990 to 2100 of 1.4-5.8&deg;C, 
  assuming a range of climate sensitivities. This range is somewhat higher than 
  the 0.7-3.5&deg;C of the SAR because of higher levels of radiative forcing in 
  the SRES scenarios than in the IS92a-f scenarios, primarily because of lower 
  sulfate aerosol emissions, especially after 2050. The equivalent range of estimates 
  of global sea-level rise (for this range of global temperature change in combination 
  with a range of ice-melt sensitivities) to 2100 is 9-88 cm (compared to 15-95 
  cm in the SAR).</p>
<p>In terms of <i>mean changes of climate</i>, results from GCMs that have been 
  run to date&#151;assuming the new SRES emissions scenarios&#151;display many 
  similarities with previous runs. Rates of warming are expected to be greater 
  than the global average over most land areas and most pronounced at high latitudes 
  in winter. As warming proceeds, northern hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent 
  will be reduced. Models indicate warming below the global average in the North 
  Atlantic and circumpolar southern ocean regions, as well as in southern and 
  southeast Asia and southern South America in June-August. Globally, there 
  will be increases in average water vapor and precipitation. Regionally, December-February 
  precipitation is expected to increase over the northern extratropics and Antarctica 
  and over tropical Africa. Models also agree on a decrease in precipitation over 
  Central America and little change in southeast Asia. Precipitation in June-August 
  is expected to increase in high northern latitudes, Antarctica, and south Asia; 
  to change little in southeast Asia; and to decrease in Central America, Australia, 
  southern Africa, and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p><i>Changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate</i> events also 
  can be expected. Based on the conclusions of the Working Group I report and 
  the likelihood scale employed there, under GHG forcing to 2100, it is very likely 
  that daytime maximum and minimum temperatures will increase, accompanied by 
  an increased frequency of hot days. It also is very likely that heat waves will 
  become more frequent; the number of cold waves and frost days (in applicable 
  regions) will decline. Increases in high-intensity precipitation events are 
  likely at many locations, and Asian summer monsoon precipitation variability 
  also is likely to increase. The frequency of summer drought will increase in 
  many interior continental locations, and it is likely that droughts, as well 
  as floods, associated with El Ni&ntilde;o events will intensify. The peak wind 
  intensity and mean and peak precipitation intensities of tropical cyclones are 
  likely to increase. The direction of changes in the average intensity of mid-latitude 
  storms cannot be determined with current climate models.</p>
<b>How can We Improve Scenarios and Their Use? </b>
<p>Methods of scenario construction and application are evolving<br>
  rapidly, but numerous deficiencies still must be addressed: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Representing and integrating future nonclimatic (socioeconomic, environmental, 
    and land-use) changes in scenarios for impact assessment</li>
  <li>Treatment of scenario uncertainties</li>
  <li>The requirement for scenario information at higher<br>
    spatial and temporal resolution</li>
  <li>Representing changes in variability and the frequency<br>
    of extreme events in scenarios</li>
  <li>Reducing time lags between climate modeling and<br>
    climate scenario development</li>
  <li>Increasing attention on the construction of policy-r<br>
    e levant scenarios (e.g., stabilization of atmospheric<br>
    CO<sub>2</sub> concentration)</li>
  <li>Recognizing linkages between scenarios for studies of<br>
    mitigation, impacts, and adaptation</li>
  <li>Improving guidance material and training in construction<br>
    and application of scenarios.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
