<h3>9.7.1. Malaria</h3>
<p>Malaria is one of the world's most serious and complex public health problems. 
  The disease is caused by four distinct species of plasmodium parasite, transmitted 
  between individuals by Anopheline mosquitoes. Each year, it causes an estimated 
  400-500 million cases and more than 1 million deaths, mostly in children (WHO, 
  1998a). Malaria is undergoing a global resurgence because of a variety of factors, 
  including complacency and policy changes that led to reduced funding for malaria 
  control programs in the 1970s and 1980s, the emergence of insecticide and drug 
  resistance, human population growth and movement, land-use change, and deteriorating 
  public health infrastructure (Lindsay and Birley, 1996). Variation in malaria 
  transmission also is associated with changes in temperature, rainfall, and humidity 
  as well as the level of immunity (Lindsay and Birley, 1996). All of these factors 
  can interact to affect adult mosquito densities and the development of the parasite 
  within the mosquito (see <a href="358.htm#tab92">Table 9-2</a>).</p>
<p>Very high temperatures are lethal to the mosquito and the parasite. In areas 
  where mean annual temperature is close to the physiological tolerance limit 
  of the parasite, a small temperature increase would be lethal to the parasite, 
  and malaria transmission would therefore decrease. However, at low temperatures, 
  a small increase in temperature can greatly increase the risk of malaria transmission 
  (Bradley, 1993; Lindsay and Birley, 1996). </p>
<p>Micro- and macroenvironmental changes can affect malaria transmission. For 
  example, deforestation may elevate local temperatures (Hamilton, 1989). Changes 
  in types of housing may change indoor temperatures where some vectors spend 
  most of the time resting (Garnham, 1945). In Africa, deforestation, vegetation 
  clearance, and irrigation can all provide the open sunlit pools that are preferred 
  by important malaria vectors and thus increase transmission (Chandler and Highton, 
  1975; Walsh <i>et al</i>., 1993; Githeko <i>et al</i>., 1996; Lindsay and Birley, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Malaria currently is present in 101 countries and territories (WHO, 1998a). 
  An estimated 40% (i.e., 2.4 billion people) of the total world population currently 
  lives in areas with malaria. In many malaria-free countries with a developed 
  public health infrastructure, the risk of sustained malaria transmission after 
  reintroduction is low in the near term. Other areas may become at risk as a 
  result of climate change if, for example, malaria control programs have broken 
  down or if transmission currently is limited mainly by temperature. Environmental 
  conditions already are so favorable for malaria transmission in tropical </p>
<p>African countries that climate change is unlikely to affect overall mortality 
  and morbidity rates in endemic lowland regions (MARA, 1998). Furthermore, reductions 
  in rainfall around the Sahel may decrease transmission in this region of Africa 
  (Mouchet <i>et al</i>., 1996; Martens <i>et al</i>., 1999). Future climate change 
  may increase transmission in some highland regions, such as in East Africa (Lindsay 
  and Martens, 1998, Mouchet <i>et al</i>., 1998; Cox <i>et al</i>., 1999; see 
  <a href="#box92">Box 9-2</a>). Studies that map malaria in Africa indicate that, 
  at the broad scale, distribution of the disease is determined by climate, except 
  at the southern limit (MARA, 1998). Malaria transmission currently is well within 
  the climatic limits of its distribution in mid- to high-latitude developed countries 
  because of effective control measures and other environmental changes. However, 
  in South America the southern limits of malaria distribution may be affected 
  by climate change. The southern geographical distribution limit of a major malaria 
  vector in South America (An. darlingi) coincides with the April mean isotherm 
  of 20&deg;C. If temperature and rainfall increase in Argentina, An. darlingi 
  may extend its distribution in southern Argentina, whereas if rainfall decreases, 
  conditions may become unfavorable for An. darlingi (Carcavallo and Curto de 
  Casas, 1996).</p>

        <p><b>Box 9-2. Have Recent Increases in Highland Malaria been Caused by 
          Climate Warming?</b></p>
        <p align="left">"Highland malaria" usually is defined as malaria 
          that occurs around its altitudinal limit, exhibiting an unstable fluctuating 
          pattern. There has been considerable debate about the causes of the 
          resurgence of malaria in the African highlands. Early in the 20th century, 
          malaria epidemics occurred at elevations of 1,500-2,500 m in Africa, 
          South America, and New Guinea (Mouchet <i>et al</i>., 1998; Reiter, 
          1998a). Highland malaria in Africa was effectively controlled in the 
          1950s and 1960s, mainly through the use of DDT and improved medical 
          care. Important changes that have contributed to the subsequent resurgence 
          include changes in land use, decreasing resources for malaria control 
          and treatment, and population growth and movement (Lindsay and Martens, 
          1998; Malakooti <i>et al</i>., 1998; Mouchet <i>et al</i>., 1998; Reiter, 
          1998a). There are insufficient historical data on malaria distribution 
          and activity to determine the role of warming, if any, in the recent 
          resurgence of malaria in the highlands of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and 
          Ethiopia (Cox <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
        <p align="left">That malaria is sensitive to temperature in some highland 
          regions is illustrated by the effect of El Ni&ntilde;o. Increases in 
          malaria have been attributed to observed El Ni&ntilde;o-associated warming 
          in highland regions in Rwanda (Loevinsohn, 1994) and Pakistan (Bouma 
          <i>et al</i>., 1996). However, increases in rainfall (sometimes associated 
          with El Ni&ntilde;o) also trigger highland epidemics (e.g., Uganda&#151;Lindblade 
          <i>et al</i>., 1999). Lindsay <i>et al</i>. (2000) found a reduction 
          in malaria infection in Tanzania associated with El Ni&ntilde;o when 
          heavy rainfall may have flushed out Anopheline mosquitoes from their 
          breeding sites. <br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Most increases in malaria transmission entail single epidemics 
          or a sequence of epidemics that occur over a 1- to 2-year period. Although 
          many epidemics are triggered by transient increases in temperature and/or 
          rainfall, the short time scale of events and the difficulty of linking 
          different epidemics in different parts of the world make it difficult 
          to say if long-term climate change is a factor. Furthermore, there has 
          been little work that identifies where malaria transmission currently 
          is limited by temperature and therefore where highland populations are 
          at risk of malaria as a result of climate change. To determine the role 
          of climate in the increase in highland malaria, a comprehensive research 
          effort is required, together with implementation of a sustainable disease 
          surveillance system that combines trend analyses across multiple sites 
          to account for substantial local factors. </p>

<p>Malaria was successfully eradicated from Australia, Europe, and the United 
  States in the 1950s and 1960s, but the vectors were not eliminated (Bruce-Chwatt 
  and de Zulueta, 1980; Zucker, 1996). In regions where the vectors persist in 
  sufficient abundance, there is a risk of locally transmitted malaria. This small 
  risk of very localized outbreaks may increase under climate change. Conditions 
  currently exist for malaria transmission in those countries during the summer 
  months, but few nonimported cases have been reported (Holvoet <i>et al</i>., 
  1983; Zucker, 1996; Baldari <i>et al</i>., 1998; Walker, 1998). Malaria could 
  become established again under the prolonged pressures of climatic and other 
  environmental-demographic changes if a strong public health infrastructure is 
  not maintained. A particular concern is the reintroduction of malaria in countries 
  of the former Soviet Union with economies in transition, where public health 
  infrastructure has diminished (e.g., Azerbaijan, Russia). </p>
