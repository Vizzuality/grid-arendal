<h4>8.3.4.2. Adaptation Mechanisms: Risk Reduction </h4>
<p>Although risk-spreading is largely an economic and distributional process, 
  risk reduction focuses more on technology, environmental management, land-use 
  planning, engineered disaster preparedness/ recovery, and predictive modeling. 
  Hooke (2000) provides a good overview of the challenges facing risk-reduction 
  initiatives. The UN's International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction 
  (IDNDR) is a leading example of international cooperation in this area.</p>
<p>The insurance industry is an important participant in partnership with other 
  public and private entities (Ryland, 2000). Examples include the use of geographic 
  information systems to better understand and pinpoint risks, land-use planning, 
  flood control programs, early warning systems, sustainable forest management, 
  coastal defense, and wind-resistant construction techniques supported by building 
  codes (Bourrelier <i>et al</i>., 2000; Davenport, 2000; Hamilton, 2000; Hooke, 
  2000; Sudo <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, the scale of effort has been much 
  smaller than that anticipated for global climatic changes, and loss prevention 
  generally has focused on fortifying the individual against perils, rather than 
  reducing the peril itself (Kunreuther and Roth, 1998) and on post-disaster actions 
  (Ryland, 2000).</p>
<p>Any discussion of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation also should include 
  insurance brokers, agents, risk managers, and trade associations. In 1998, there 
  were more than 750,000 such workers in the United States alone (III, 1999).<br>
  A key but often untapped opportunity is to rebuild damaged structures in a more 
  disaster-resistant fashion following loss events, as in the U.S. National Flood 
  Insurance Program. Pervasive problems with building code enforcement and compliance 
  have emerged following natural disasters. For example, 70% of the losses from 
  Hurricane Alicia were traced to lax code enforcement (III, 2000a). Building 
  industry stakeholders often resist new codes. Reinvigorating businesses and 
  other forms of economic activity also is central to disaster recovery (Carrido, 
  2000).</p>
<p>Energy systems can have important implications for economic and insured losses 
  through the vulnerability (reliability and/or physical damage) of energy generation, 
  transmission, and distribution technologies (Epps, 1997; Keener, 1997; Deering 
  and Thornton, 2000). Hydroelectric power resources, for example, are weather 
  sensitive (see <a href="545.htm">Chapter 15</a>). Climate change may confound 
  the actuarial basis for weather-related insurance provided to energy producers 
  and for utility interruption insurance provided to energy users. Energy-related 
  business interruption (via lightning damages, interrupted operations, inventory 
  spoilage, event cancellation, disrupted tourism, etc.) is a significant weather-related 
  exposure faced by the insurance sector (as evidenced by the extended power failure 
  faced by Auckland, New Zealand, following a major heat wave in 1998). The North 
  American ice storm of 1998 offers another dramatic example of the role of power 
  disruption in disaster-related insurance losses (Lecomte and Gahagan, 1998; 
  <a href="582.htm#tab155">Table 15-5</a>). Improved appraisal of the physical 
  vulnerability of existing energy systems and of new technologies deployed for 
  emission-reduction projects (e.g., as part of Clean Development Mechanism or 
  Joint Implementation) would help to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather 
  events and other losses (World Bank, 1999; Zwirner, 2000). The aftermath of 
  Hurricane Andrew illustrated the complex nature of losses caused by natural 
  disasters. About 20% of insured economic losses were related to business interruption 
  (40% in the case of Hurricane Hugo) (Mills, 1996).</p>
<p>Effective risk reduction requires foresight. The insurance sector participates 
  in a limited way in weather- and climate-related research and modeling (Kelly 
  and Zeng, 1999). The Risk Prediction Initiative and the World Institute for 
  Disaster Risk Management are two examples of insurer-funded research centers. 
  Insurers' catastrophe models are not presently used in association with 
  climate-prediction tools such as general circulation models (Peara and Mills, 
  1999). Their predictive power is poorly validated (Pielke, 1998; Pielke <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999) and often exhibits significant unexplained model-to-model variation 
  (Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999; GAO, 2000a). Insurance regulators in the United 
  States have resisted efforts to include them in ratemaking proceedings (III, 
  2000b). Thus, the insurance community may stand to benefit from analytical collaboration 
  with the natural sciences community (Nutter 1996; Changnon <i>et al</i>., 1997; 
  Zeng, 2000; Mills <i>et al</i>., 2001). Formal solvency analyses conducted by 
  insurance regulators also could benefit from more explicit treatment of future 
  climate scenarios.</p>
<p>Although much progress has been made in risk-reduction technology per se, attention 
  is increasingly focused on problems of implementation. Key issues identified 
  by IDNDR include public awareness of risks, training of practitioners, commitment 
  by public officials, and justification and financing of risk-reduction strategies 
  (Hamilton, 2000; Hooke, 2000)&#151;all areas where the financial services sector 
  can play a part.<a name="box82"></a></p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 8-2. Equity Issues that are Relevant for the 
        Insurance and Other Financial Services Sectors</b> </div>
      <p>Equity is a material issue facing the financial services sector systems, 
        within and among countries. For example, inequities can be created when 
        the premiums paid by insureds become severely decoupled from the risks 
        they face. On the other hand, strictly equalized insurance payments can 
        result in a problem known as "adverse selection," wherein only 
        those with higher-than-average risk will actively purchase insurance, 
        causing the system to become ineffective. </p>
      <p>The burden of natural disasters tends to fall disproportionately on economically 
        disadvantaged people, especially in developing countries (Hooke, 2000; 
        Kreimer and Arnold, 2000). However, access to the benefits of insurance 
        is correlated with income level. Lower income consumers in poor and wealthy 
        countries alike have difficulty affording insurance or financing even 
        at current rates (Miller <i>et al</i>., 2000) and often live and work 
        in more vulnerable locations. Immigrant cultural groups, as well as aboriginal 
        peoples, may have less access to pre-disaster information and be more 
        vulnerable to natural disasters themselves (Solis <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
      </p>
      <p>As an illustration of price-related stresses, projected increases in 
        coastal erosion in the United States would require a doubling of current 
        insurance rates&#151;probably requiring cross-subsidies among insureds 
        (Heinz Center, 2000).</p>
      <p>In developing nations, the availability of insurance and financing has 
        considerably lower penetration than in wealthy nations. At the global 
        scale, one form of inequity arises in which a greater share of the costs 
        of extreme weather events are borne by governments and consumers in the 
        "south" than in the "north." Rising uncertainties 
        could reduce the availability of insurance in some areas and impede the 
        expansion of adaptive capacity offered by insurance markets in developing 
        countries. Governments' ability to compensate by providing more insurance 
        and disaster relief would be similarly strained.</p>
