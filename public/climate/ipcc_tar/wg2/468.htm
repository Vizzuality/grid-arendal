<h4>12.1.5.2. Uncertainties and Probabilistic Scenarios </h4>
<p>Some of the Australasian scenarios include uncertainty bands, based on the 
  ranges of global warmings resulting from the IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios, 
  the IPCC range of global sensitivity, or ranges of estimates of Australasian 
  temperature or rainfall changes from different GCMs. Unquantified additional 
  sources of uncertainty include changes in emission scenarios, such as to the 
  new SRES scenarios; regional effects of biospheric feedback; and regional effects 
  of global aerosol distributions. Quantification of potential changes in extreme 
  events, tropical cyclones, and ENSO also are major uncertainties (see below), 
  and uncertainty about the strength of the westerly circulation and hence rainfall 
  regimes is a source of uncertainty for New Zealand. The modeled lag in warming 
  in the Southern Ocean in the 20th century appears to be greater than that observed 
  (Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 1996a), but this has not yet been thoroughly analyzed. 
  Other conceivable lower probability, high-impact changes (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>) such as changes in ocean circulation, ENSO behavior, or tropical cyclones 
  could have important regional impacts. </p>
<p>Probabilistic scenarios for risk and adaptation analyses (see <a href="485.htm#1284">Section 
  12.8.4</a>), based on the quantifiable range of uncertainties, have been explored 
  by CSIRO (Pittock, 1999; Jones, 2000; Pittock and Jones, 2000).</p>
<a name="12153"></a> 
<h4>12.1.5.3 Changes in Extreme Events and Sea Level</h4>
<p>Pittock <i>et al.</i> (1999) have summarized the past importance of extreme 
  events for Australia and prospects for the future. Major climatic hazards arise 
  in Australia and New Zealand from tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, windstorm, 
  snowstorm, wildfires, landslides, hail, lightning, heat waves, frost, and storm 
  surges. Events that are directly related to temperature are more predictable 
  (more heat waves, fewer frosts) than those associated with wind and rain; <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> discusses relevant projections and confidence levels (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>). The incidence of wildfire in Australia is expected to increase with 
  global warming (Beer and Williams, 1995; Pittock <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Williams 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2001), as is that of landslides and storm surges (the latter 
  because of both higher mean sea level and increased storm intensities). Changes 
  in hail and lightning frequencies are uncertain, although there are some arguments 
  for expected increases (Price and Rind, 1994; McMaster, 1999; Pittock <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>More intense tropical cyclones in the Australian region (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>; Walsh and Ryan, 2000) would have serious implications for storm-surge 
  heights, wind damages, and flooding. If they were to travel further poleward 
  (Walsh and Katzfey, 2000), they would be more likely to impact on coastal regions 
  in the southwest of western Australia, southern Queensland, and the northern 
  NSW coastal region, as well as northern parts of New Zealand. The locations 
  of tropical cyclone genesis in the region are correlated with ENSO (Evans and 
  Allan, 1992; Basher and Zheng, 1995), so any change in the mean state of the 
  tropical Pacific may affect the risk of tropical cyclone occurrence in particular 
  locations.</p>
<p>Mid-latitude storms also may increase in intensity (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>), and their frequency and location could change&#151;for example, as 
  a result of changes in the westerlies and ENSO. This would impact return periods 
  for mid-latutude storm surges, high winds, and other phenomena.</p>
<p>Interannual variability in ENSO leads to major floods and droughts in Australia 
  and New Zealand. Such variations are expected to continue under enhanced greenhouse 
  conditions, though possibly with greater hydrological extremes as a result of 
  more intense rainfall in La Ni&ntilde;a years and more intense drought resulting 
  from higher rates of evaporation during El Ni&ntilde;o years (Walsh <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). A more El Ni&ntilde;o-like mean state of the tropical Pacific Ocean (see 
  <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a>; Cai and Whetton, 2000) would imply 
  greater drought frequency (Kothavala, 1999; Walsh <i>et al.</i>, 2000), as does 
  the drying trend found over the Murray-Darling Basin in recent AOGCM simulations 
  (Arnell, 1999).</p>
<p>Mean sea level is expected to increase, with local and regional variations 
  as a result of land-sea movements and changes to ocean currents and climatic 
  forcing (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). In addition, local and regional 
  meteorological forcing leads to temporary fluctuations in sea level and extreme 
  events that may cause coastal inundation. In New Zealand, storm surges of as 
  much as about 1 m are possible at open-coast locations (Heath, 1979; Bell <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1999). Storm surges in tropical Australia can be several meters as 
  a result of tropical cyclonic forcing and shallow continental shelfs (Hubbert 
  and McInnes, 1999a,b; McInnes <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>The actual height reached by a storm surge depends not only on the location 
  and intensity of the storm but on its timing relative to the tides, coastal 
  bathymetry and topography, and slower variations such as those from ENSO. The 
  latter contribute to significant local sea-level variations around the coasts 
  of Australia (Chiera <i>et al.</i>, 1997) and New Zealand (Bell <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). In addition, any changes in storm intensities, frequencies, and locations 
  will change the average time between surges of a given magnitude at particular 
  locations. </p>

<h4>12.1.5.4 New SRES Scenarios</h4>
<p>Interim characterizations of regional climate changes to 2100 associated with 
  the SRES emissions scenarios have been provided by Hulme and Sheard (1999) and 
  Carter <i>et al.</i> (2000). However, they do not consider aerosol-induced spatial 
  effects, and they use linear scaling of regional patterns of change from seven 
  coupled GCM models, according to a range of global mean warmings generated using 
  MAGICC (Wigley, 1995; Wigley <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<p>Over Australia, these studies show warmings in the 2080s higher than the IS92 
  scenarios, with similar spatial patterns. In New Zealand, warmings in the 2080s 
  are estimated to be from 0.5 to &gt;2.0&deg;C. Projected precipitation changes 
  are large (&gt;1 standard deviation of the simulated 30-year variability) over 
  much of southern Australia, with a decrease over the mainland in both summer 
  and winter and an increase over Tasmania in winter. Over the South Island of 
  New Zealand, an increase is predicted. For the 2080s, projected decreases in 
  annual rainfall in the southwest of western Australia range from about zero 
  (B1 low scenario) to between 30 and 50% (A2 high scenario). Projected rainfall 
  increases over the South Island of New Zealand of 0-10% (B1) to 10-20% 
  (A2) should be regarded with caution because the AOGCM simulations do not fully 
  incorporate the important influence of the Southern Alps on South Island rainfall 
  patterns.</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios have not yet been applied in any detailed studies of impacts 
  in the region. Unlike parts of the northern hemisphere, high regional concentrations 
  of sulfate aerosols are not expected in the Australasian region under any accepted 
  scenario, so any increase in warming resulting from reduced sulfate aerosols 
  will be less over Australia and New Zealand than in some regions of the northern 
  hemisphere.</p>
<p>To date, impact and vulnerability studies in Australia and New Zealand in general 
  have not taken account of specific socioeconomic scenarios for the future, such 
  as those laid out in the SRES. Thus, vulnerabilities have been based on projected 
  climate change impacts and adaptation, assuming the present socioeconomic situation, 
  in some cases with a qualitative allowance for expected socioeconomic trends 
  (e.g., increased competition for water supplies, increased population and investment 
  in coastal zones).</p>
