<h4>5.6.1.1. Carbon Pools and Flux</h4>
<p>Carbon pools in the world's forests are estimated to be 348 Gt C in vegetation 
  and 478 Gt C in soil (to 1 m) (updated since Dixon et al., 1994b, by Brown, 
  1998). Bolin and Sukumar (2000) based their numbers on Dixon et al. (1994b). 
  The largest vegetation and soil carbon pools are in tropical forests (60 and 
  45% of the total, respectively) because of their large extent and relatively 
  high carbon densities. Carbon stocks in forests vary, depending on the type 
  of forest in relation to climate, soil, management, frequency of disturbances, 
  and level of human-caused degradation. </p>
<p>Based on traditional carbon inventories, terrestrial ecosystems were shown 
  to be carbon sources during the 1980s in the SAR (Brown et al., 1996); a high- 
  and mid-latitude forest sink was exceeded by the source from low-latitude forests. 
  However, recent work&#151;using atmospheric measurements and modeling&#151;suggests 
  that terrestrial ecosystems appear to be net sinks for atmospheric carbon, even 
  when losses from land-use change are taken into account (Bolin and Sukumar, 
  2000). For the 1980s, a net storage increase of 0.2 &plusmn; 1.0 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> by 
  terrestrial ecosystems (largely in forests) was estimated as the difference 
  between a net emission of 1.7 &plusmn; 0.8 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> from land-use changes (primarily 
  in the tropics) and global terrestrial uptake of 1.9 &plusmn; 1.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (Bolin and Sukumar, 2000). In the 1990s, estimated net emissions from land-use 
  change decreased slightly to 1.6 &plusmn; 0.8 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>, and global terrestrial 
  uptake increased to 2.3 &plusmn; 1.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>, resulting in a net terrestrial 
  uptake of 0.7 +1.0 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Bolin and Sukumar, 2000). This terrestrial net 
  sink of carbon arises as the net effect of land-use practices (agricultural 
  abandonment and regrowth, deforestation, and degradation); the indirect effects 
  of human activities (e.g., atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization and nutrient deposition); 
  and the effects of changing climate, climatic variation, and disturbances. The 
  relative importance of these different processes is known to vary strongly from 
  region to region. </p>
<p>Regional source and sink relationships also have been inferred by techniques 
  of inverse modeling of observed atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> gradients and circulation patterns 
  (Ciais et al., 1995; Fan et al., 1998). These estimates are relatively imprecise 
  and are difficult to relate to those that are based on forest inventory data. 
  For example, the study by Fan et al. (1998) suggests that 1.4 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> was 
  taken up by terrestrial biota in North America in the 1980s. However, mechanistic 
  models and measurements based on forest inventories do not agree with the magnitude 
  or spatial distribution of this carbon sink (Holland and Brown, 1999; Potter 
  and Klooster, 1999).</p>
<p>Temperate forests are considered to be net carbon sinks at present, with estimates 
  of 1.4-2.0 t C ha-1 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Nabuurs et al., 1997; Brown and Schroeder, 1999; 
  Schulze et al., 1999). These findings are consistent with recent estimates of 
  carbon in woody biomass, based on statistics for 55 temperate and boreal countries; 
  these statistics indicate a general increase in forest biomass from the 1980s 
  to the 1990s (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000c). Changes in forest management (reduction of 
  harvest levels, increased regeneration effort, and administrative set-asides), 
  as well as changes in the environment (N and CO<sub>2</sub> fertililization), appear to 
  have contributed to this trend, but the relative contribution of different factors 
  varies among forest regions and countries (Kauppi et al., 1992; Houghton et 
  al., 1998, 1999; Brown and Schroeder, 1999; Liski et al., 1999; Nadelhoffer 
  et al., 1999). </p>
<p>In boreal forests, carbon budgets vary strongly among different forest types 
  (Apps et al., 1993; Bonan, 1993, Shvidenko and Nilsson, 1994). Although some 
  boreal forest regions currently appear to be net carbon sources (Shepashenko 
  et al., 1998; Kurz and Apps, 1999), others appear to be net sinks, varying between 
  0.5 and 2.5 t C ha-1 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Shvidenko and Nilsson, 1994; Jarvis et al., 1997). 
  The difference between annual increment and net fellings reported to the FAO 
  (reported in UN-ECE/ FAO, 2000c) does not account for changes in the frequency 
  and severity of disturbances that have a large influence on source and sink 
  relationships in boreal forests (Kasischke et al., 1995; Kurz and Apps, 1999; 
  Bhatti, 2001). For example, detailed analyses of forest inventory data together 
  with observed changes in disturbance over time indicate that Canadian forest 
  ecosystems changed from a modest sink (0.075 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>) from 1920-1970 
  to a small net source of 0.050 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1994 (Kurz and Apps, 1999). Similarly, 
  in Russia between 1983 and 1992, managed forest ecosystems in the European portion, 
  where disturbances were relatively controlled, were a sink of 0.051 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  but a net source of 0.081-0.123 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in the less intensively managed 
  Siberian forests of the east (Shepashenko et al., 1998). Factors that were not 
  included in these analyses that may offset losses of biotic carbon from disturbed 
  forests include nitrogen deposition and CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization (Chen et al., 2000; 
  Schimel et al., 2000), but experimental verification of these influences is 
  not yet possible from inventory data. </p>
<p>In the tropics, forests are still reported to be a net carbon source as a result 
  of land-use change. Although some studies suggest net carbon uptake in some 
  tropical forests (Grace et al., 1995; Phillips et al., 1998), losses associated 
  with high rates of forest clearing and degradation exceed such gains. The magnitude 
  of the net carbon source from the tropics has been reported to be about 0.1 
  Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> lower in the first half of the 1990s than in the 1980s (Houghton and 
  Hackler, 1999; Houghton et al., 2000; Houghton, 2001), mostly because of reduced 
  rates of deforestation in the 1990s (FAO, 1996, 1997a).</p>
<p>In summary, carbon stored in forest ecosystems appears to be increasing, and 
  at an increasing rate with about 0.2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> being stored in the 1980s and 
  0.7 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1990s. Most storage occurs in temperate forests, with a 
  small net source from tropical forests and boreal forests varying depending 
  on the disturbance regime they experience.</p>
