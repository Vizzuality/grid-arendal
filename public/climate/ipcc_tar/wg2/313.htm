<h3>7.3.2. Transportation </h3>
<p>Changnon (1996a) studied the effects of potential shifts in summer precipitation 
  on transportation in Chicago, using data for 1977-79 and assuming continued 
  use of current modes of transport. The study suggests that a future climate 
  with more summer rainy days, somewhat higher rain rates, and more rainstorms 
  would increase total vehicular accidents and total injuries in vehicular accidents, 
  reduce travel on public transportation systems, and cause more aircraft accidents 
  and delays. A drier climate probably would experience fewer moderate to heavy 
  rain events, but results show that rain events during drier conditions produce 
  a greater frequency of accidents and injuries per event than during wetter conditions. 
  If high-heat events became more common with warmer climate, they also could 
  become a problem. They have been known to soften asphalt roads, "explode" or 
  buckle concrete roads, warp railroad rails, close airports because of lack of 
  "lift" in extremely hot air, and increase mechanical failures in automobiles 
  and trucks. On the other hand, there might be fewer mechanical failures resulting 
  from extreme cold (Adams, 1997). Floods are costly to transportation systems, 
  as they are to other infrastructure. Although the effect of climate change on 
  flying weather is not clear, transportation by air is known to be sensitive 
  to adverse weather conditions; major systemwide effects sometimes follow from 
  flight cancellations, rerouting, or rescheduling. For example, one diverted 
  flight can cause anywhere from 2 to 50 flight delays, and one canceled flight 
  can result in 15-20 flight delays. The cost of a diverted flight can be as much 
  as US$150,000, and a cancellation can cost close to US$40,000. The corresponding 
  direct annual costs to 16 U.S. airlines are US$47 million and US$222 million, 
  respectively (Qualley, 1997). Several additional examples of impacts on transportation 
  are cited in <a href="491.htm">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="733"></a>7.3.3. Construction </h3>
<p>Flooding and other extreme weather events that damage buildings and infrastructure 
  could cost the world's economies billions of dollars under climate change simply 
  to replace the damage-a cost that could divert funds from other needed investment 
  (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). However, Mimura et al. (1998) note that 
  cost increases for disaster rehabilitation and countermeasures against natural 
  calamities could expand the market for the construction industry. Although no 
  direct studies have been done, it is likely that a greater incidence of summer 
  heat waves would reduce the productivity of this sector, but a lower incidence 
  of cold waves and snowy conditions would increase the amount of year-round construction 
  that could be accomplished in climates that currently have long, cold winters. 
  Changes in design requirements for infrastructure, leading to additional requirements 
  for construction, are discussed in the SAR. </p>
<h3><a name="734"></a>7.3.4. Manufacturing </h3>
<p>Manufacturing industries that are not directly dependent on natural resources 
  generally would not be affected by climate unless key infrastructure is destroyed 
  by flood or landslides, or unless shipments of inputs and outputs are affected 
  (e.g., by snow blocking roads, airports, and train tracks; flooding or low flow 
  that make river transportation untenable; or low water supplies that make process 
  cooling and environmental activities more difficult). However, manufacturers 
  are influenced by climate change in two other ways. First, they would be affected 
  through the impact of government policies pertaining to climate change, such 
  as carbon taxes (thereby increasing the cost of inputs). Second, they could 
  be affected through consumer behavior that in turn is affected by climatic variations. 
  For example, less cold-weather clothing and more warm-weather clothing might 
  be ordered. Manufacture that depends on climate-sensitive natural resources 
  would be affected by impacts on those resources. For example, food processing 
  activity would follow the success of agriculture. Very little is known concerning 
  the effects of warming on industry, and most information is highly speculative. 
</p>
<h3><a name="735"></a>7.3.5. Financial Services and Insurance </h3>
<p>Climate change increases risks for the insurance sector, but the effect on 
  profitability is not likely to be severe because insurance companies are capable 
  of shifting changed risks to the insured, provided that they are "properly and 
  timely informed" on the consequences of climate change (Tol, 1998). For example, 
  during the great storms in the early 1990s, the insurance sector reacted to 
  increased risk and large losses by restricting coverage and raising premiums. 
  Tucker (1997) also shows that increased climatic variability necessitates higher 
  insurance premiums to account for the higher probability of damages. However, 
  insurance companies still can be destabilized by large losses in a major weather-related 
  catastrophe in a region where actuarial tables and estimated risks do not adequately 
  reflect true weather risk (including greater variability), and companies therefore 
  may not have made adequate provision for losses. See <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> for a description of impacts on financial services. </p>
<h3><a name="736"></a>7.3.6. Estimating and Valuing Effects </h3>
<p>Valuation of climate impacts remains difficult on three grounds. The first 
  is uncertainty associated with determining physical changes and responses to 
  these changes. The second is economic valuations of these changes that vary 
  across regions. Fankhauser et al. (1998) show that damage cost estimates are 
  sensitive to assumptions made on the basis of valuation (willingness to pay 
  versus willingness to accept), accountability for impacts, differentiation of 
  per unit values, and aggregation of damage costs over diverse regions. A third 
  problem can be expressed as follows: "Which metric?" Five popular metrics are 
  used: market costs, lives lost, species lost, changes in the distribution of 
  costs/benefits, changes in quality of life (loss of heritage sites, environmental 
  refugees, etc). Schneider et al. (2000) conclude that when aggregation exercises 
  are undertaken, disaggregation of all estimated effects into each of five numeraires 
  is needed first, followed by a traceable account of any aggregation so others 
  holding different weighting schemes for each numeraire can re-aggregate. This 
  is done rarely, if ever. </p>
<p>The Workshop on the Social and Economic Impacts of Weather at the National 
  Center for Atmospheric Research, 2-4 April 1997, in Boulder, CO, estimated that 
  property losses from extreme weather of all types currently costs the United 
  States about $15 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> ($6.2 billion related to hurricanes), 
  as well as about 1,500 deaths (about half resulting from cold events); the worst 
  flood and hurricane years yield about $30-40 billion in property losses. </p>
<p>Smith (1996) standardized estimates of climate change damages for the United 
  States for a 2.5°C warming, a 50-cm sea-level rise, 1990 income and population, 
  and a 4% real rate of return on investments. Total damage estimates are slightly 
  less than 1% of United States gross national product (GNP) in 1990. Within individual 
  sectors such as agriculture and electricity, however, standardized damages differ 
  by more than an order of magnitude. This level of uncertainty appears to apply 
  among experts as well. For example, Nordhaus (1994) surveyed experts, and their 
  damage estimates ranged over more than an order of magnitude. </p>
<p>Yohe et al. (1996) calculated the cost of a 50-cm sea-level rise trajectory 
  for developed property along the U.S. coastline. Transient costs in 2065 were 
  estimated to be approximately $70 million (undiscounted and measured in constant 
  1990 US$). These costs are nearly an order of magnitude lower than estimates 
  published prior to 1995 (e.g., Fankhauser, 1995). This is because Yohe et al. 
  (1996) incorporated the cost-reducing potential of market-based adaptation in 
  anticipation of the threat of sea-level rise. In addition, they assumed efficient 
  discrete decisions to protect or abandon small tracts of property, based on 
  their economic merit. Some work since suggests that maladaptation may cause 
  the costs of sea-level rise to be somewhat higher (West and Dowlatabadi, 1998). 
</p>
<h3><a name="737"></a>7.3.7. Tools/Methods/Approaches/Models Used in Developing 
  New Knowledge, including Assumptions, Sensitivities, and Scenarios Used in Models 
</h3>
<p>Current impact assessment methods focus on comparing current conditions to 
  a single alternative steady state-that associated with doubling of GHGs. Mendelsohn 
  and Schlesinger (1999) attempt to estimate climate response functions for market 
  sectors in the United States that reflect how damages change as climate changes 
  through a range of values. Impacts are generated by using national climate values, 
  rather than global values, and the timing of climate change is included in the 
  modeling of capital-intensive sectors such as coastal resources and timber, 
  which cannot adjust quickly. Empirical estimates of climate response functions 
  are based on laboratory experiments coupled with process-based simulation models 
  and cross-sectional studies (Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1998). Both methods indicate 
  that agriculture, forestry, and energy have a bell-shaped relationship to temperature. 
  Similarly, an increase in precipitation is likely to be beneficial to some agriculture, 
  forestry, and water sectors, although this effect is reversed at sufficiently 
  high levels. However, this work captures neither the transient response of the 
  climate system nor the actual dynamics of the energy sector in response to climate 
  (e.g., Schneider, 1997).</p>
