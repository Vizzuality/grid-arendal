<h3>12.9.7. Knowledge Gaps </h3>
<p>Significant knowledge gaps have become apparent during this assessment. These 
  gaps mean that the net cost or benefit of unmitigated climate change in Australia 
  and New Zealand is highly uncertain (see <a href="487.htm#1291">Section 12.9.1</a>) 
  and cannot be compared objectively with the cost of mitigation. Without this 
  knowledge base, policymaking regarding adaptation and mitigation cannot be soundly 
  based on economic considerations. Research priorities follow.</p>
<p><i>Indicators of climate impacts: </i>Although long-term monitoring programs 
  are in place for physical indicators (such as climate variables and sea level), 
  work is still desirable on designing and implementing long-term monitoring programs 
  that cover vulnerable animals, plants, and ecosystems and systematically examining 
  them for the effects of climate changes. Flora and fauna with presently restricted 
  or marginal climatic ranges would be most appropriate (see <a href="471.htm#124">Section 
  12.4</a>). (Candidate indicators for the UK are presented in Cannell <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999.)</p>
<p><i>Underpinning physical knowledge and improved scenarios:</i> Improved impact 
  assessments will depend on better understanding of how climate change may influence 
  factors such as the frequency and intensity of El Ni&ntilde;os and related droughts, 
  the intensity and location-specific frequency of tropical cyclones, and return 
  periods for heavy rainfalls, floods, high winds, and hail. Oceanic issues include 
  understanding differences between observed and modeled lag in warming of the 
  Southern Ocean (see <a href="468.htm#12152">Section 12.1.5.2</a>), possible 
  impacts of cessation of bottomwater formation (see <a href="473.htm#1247">Section 
  12.4.7</a>), and determining the influence of greenhouse warming on currents, 
  upwelling, and nutrient supply. More knowledge is needed about influences of 
  GHG-related cooling in the stratosphere on ozone depletion and regional UV radiation 
  levels (see <a href="481.htm#1271">Section 12.7.1</a>). All of this knowledge 
  is needed to improve scenarios of regional climate (including ocean behavior).</p>
<p><i>Underpinning biological knowledge:</i> The sensitivities of many plant and 
  animal species and ecosystems in this region to climate changes, as well as 
  the potential threats to biodiversity, are still unknown (see <a href="471.htm#124">Section 
  12.4</a>). Knowledge is required for assessment of potential impacts and for 
  development of conservation strategies. This is important for marine and coastal 
  environments, including coastal freshwater wetlands (see <a href="473.htm#1247">Section 
  12.4.7</a>), as well as for terrestrial systems. Identification of relevant 
  climatic thresholds for biological (and other) systems is needed (see <a href="484.htm#1282">Section 
  12.8.2</a>). The effects of the time-varying balance between the beneficial 
  physiological effects of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and climate 
  change on natural (indigenous) and managed ecosystems needs to be better understood, 
  especially in light of recent regional scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Underpinning social knowledge:</i> Better knowledge is required about the 
  vulnerability of particular population groups (including indigenous people), 
  about how people and organizations have adapted to past climate variability 
  and changes, and about public attitudes to adaptation and mitigation options. 
  Work is needed to understand how different socioeconomic futures (demography, 
  economic capacity, and technological change) (see <a href="468.htm#12154">Section 
  12.1.5.4</a>) would affect vulnerability (see <a href="484.htm#128">Sections 
  12.8</a> and <a href="487.htm#1292">12.9.2.2</a>) and on socioeconomic thresholds 
  for change, such as economic nonviability and unacceptable risk.</p>
<p><i>Fisheries:</i> There is insufficient information to enable confident predictions 
  of changes in fisheries productivity from climate change (see <a href="476.htm#1255">Section 
  12.5.5</a>). This requires better knowledge of physical and biological processes 
  in the ocean (as above) and improved information on the climate sensitivities 
  of many species. </p>
<p><i>Health:</i> Continuing work is needed on the potential for introduction 
  (New Zealand) and spread (Australia) of significant disease vectors, including 
  sensitivity to climate, population shifts, and effectiveness of health services 
  and biosecurity procedures (see <a href="482.htm#1274">Section 12.7.4</a>). 
  Other health issues should be addressed, including potential effects of threats 
  to water supply on remote communities (see <a href="483.htm#1276">Section 12.7.6</a>).</p>
<p><i>Regional effects and integration:</i> Better quantitative sectoral knowledge 
  is required about, for example, influences of climate change on water supply 
  and demand (see <a href="470.htm#1231">Section 12.3.1</a>), salinization (see 
  <a href="470.htm#1233">Section 12.3.3</a>), and some crops and farming practices 
  (see <a href="474.htm#1252">Sections 12.5.2</a> and <a href="475.htm#1253">12.5.3</a>). 
  Because various sectors (e.g., agriculture, ecosystems, infrastructure, and 
  hydrology) interact at the regional and national levels, continued work is needed 
  on integrated assessment approaches and models that synthesize sectoral knowledge 
  and draw on the social sciences (see <a href="484.htm#1282">Section 12.8.2</a>), 
  in rural and urban settings. Models of the physical economy that track fluxes 
  and pools of materials, energy, land, and water are required for national analyses. 
</p>
<p><i>Global interactions:</i> More understanding is needed of the interaction 
  of global climate change impacts, and of mitigation policies, on Australian 
  and New Zealand markets, sectoral change, and land use (see <a href="478.htm#1259">Sections 
  12.5.9</a> and <a href="486.htm#1287">12.8.7</a>).</p>
<p><i>Adaptation:</i> Further objective studies are required, in close collaboration 
  with stakeholders, on adaptation options and their acceptability, costs, co-benefits, 
  side effects, and limits (see <a href="484.htm#128">Section 12.8</a>). Adaptation 
  should be regarded as a means to maximize gains and minimize losses, with a 
  greater exploration of opportunities (see <a href="484.htm#1281">Section 12.8.1</a>).</p>
<p><i>Costing:</i> More comprehensive and realistic costings are needed for impacts 
  and adaptation options, taking account of human behavior and using up-to-date 
  scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Communication of policy-relevant results:</i> If climate change issues are 
  to be addressed by decisionmakers, there will need to be better communication 
  of results from research. This will come partly from consultation with decisionmakers 
  and other stakeholders to ensure that the right policy-relevant questions are 
  addressed (see <a href="484.htm#1282">Sections 12.8.2</a> and <a href="487.htm#129">12.9</a>) 
  and partly from effective communication of what is known, as well as the uncertainties. 
  A risk-assessment approach geared to particular stakeholders seems likely to 
  be most effective (see <a href="488.htm#1295">Section 12.9.5</a>).</p>
