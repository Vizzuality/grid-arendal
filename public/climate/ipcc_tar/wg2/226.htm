<h4>5.4.3.3.4. Decomposers and soil maintainers</h4>
<p>Invertebrates and microorganisms living on or below the soil surface provide 
  needed goods and services to human societies (e.g., mixing and aeration of soils, 
  decomposition of materials and human waste) (Daily et al., 1997). These processes 
  contribute to creation of fertile topsoil from organic matter and mineral components 
  of the soil. Some of these organisms (e.g., ants) are susceptible to climatic 
  changes, especially droughts (Folgarait, 1998). On a global scale, the estimated 
  cost of replacing waste elimination services performed by these organisms is 
  hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars annually; the estimated cost of replacing 
  topsoil production services is tens of billions of U.S. dollars annually (de 
  Groot, 1992; Crosson et al., 1995; Pimentel et al., 1995; Daily et al., 1997). 
</p>
<h4><a name="54335"></a>5.4.3.3.5. Protection of endangered species</h4>
<p>Another way of assessing the value of wildlife is by examining how much is 
  spent on its conservation. In fiscal year 1995, approximately US$330 million 
  was spent on the conservation of threatened and endangered species in the United 
  States and its territories (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1995). As pressures 
  facing wildlife increase, the number of species that require conservation attention 
  also will most likely increase. </p>
<h4><a name="54336"></a>5.4.3.3.6. Subsistence hunting</h4>
<p>People in many parts of the world depend on wildlife for their daily nutritional 
  needs. This is most pronounced in less-developed areas. For example, the Cree 
  along James Bay in Canada harvest approximately 800,000 kg of animal food annually. 
  The per capita replacement value of this harvest was estimated to be CDN$6,000 
  in 1986 dollars (Scott, 1987). The abundance of caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) 
  available for harvest by indigenous peoples could decrease as a result of increased 
  temperatures, snowfall, and potential shifts in the timing of precipitation 
  (Brotton and Wall, 1997; Ferguson, 1999). Adverse impacts also have been projected 
  for other subsistence species, including marine birds, seals, polar bears (Stirling, 
  1997), tundra birds (Jefferies et al., 1992), and other tundra-grazing ungulates 
  (Jeffries, et al., 1992; Gunn, 1995).</p>
<p>Wildlife species also are a significant source of food and medicine for people 
  in many temperate and tropical countries, such as Botswana and Nigeria (McNeely 
  et al., 1990) and Australia (Bomford and Caughley, 1996). Among the Boran (Kenya), 
  birds are used for medicines (ostrich oils) and their feathers for cleaning 
  wounds (Isack, 1987). In many countries, climate change impacts such as reductions 
  in wildlife populations may have the greatest impact on the lowest-income groups&#151;those 
  with the least ability to adapt if hunting opportunities decline (Arntzen and 
  Ringrose, 1996).</p>
<h4><a name="54337"></a>5.4.3.3.7. Recreational use of animals and ecotourism</h4>
<p>In many African countries, ecotourism to view wildlife is a major contributor 
  to gross national product (GNP). Worldwide, ecotourism is estimated to provide 
  US$500 billion to 1 trillion annually to the global economy (Munasinghe and 
  McNeely, 1994). Changes in climate could reduce the populations of some of the 
  species people are willing to pay to see (Mills et al., 1995; Allen-Diaz, 1996).</p>
