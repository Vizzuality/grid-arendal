<h3><a name="1532"></a>15.3.2. Subregional and Extra-Regional Cases </h3>
<h4><a name="15321"></a>15.3.2.1. Introduction</h4>
<p>The discussion that follows offers a sample of subregional and extra-regional 
  cases that reflect the unique and changing nature of the relationship between 
  climate and places in the North American context. Six subregions have been defined: 
  Pacific, Rocky Mountains-Southwest United States, Prairies-Great Plains, 
  Great Lakes-St. Lawrence, North Atlantic, and Southeast United States (see 
  <a href="#fig159">Figure 15-9</a>). These subregions represent unique landscapes 
  that have experienced development paths that reflect natural potential for resource 
  development as well as region-specific histories of evolving economies and communities. 
  Some of these cases describe responses to recent extreme events. Others focus 
  on scenarios of future climatic changes. Canada and the United States have a 
  long history of cooperating on resource management concerns in transboundary 
  areas, including the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and more recent agreements 
  on transboundary air pollution, watershed development, and the environmental 
  agreement associated with NAFTA. There also have been binational and subregional 
  conflicts over a wide range of issues that are climate-sensitive, including 
  water resources, wetland protection, trading of forest and agricultural commodities, 
  and harvesting of transboundary fish stocks. Various cooperative management 
  approaches are being considered. Could climate change make a difference in any 
  of these conflicts? Extra-regional issues are considered for the Arctic, U.S.-Mexican, 
  and U.S.-Caribbean borders.</p>

<h4><a name="15322"></a>15.3.2.2. Pacific Subregion</h4>
<p>This subregion includes the Columbia River basin&#151;the fourth-largest in 
  North America, and one of the most valuable and heavily developed watersheds. 
  The Columbia system produces 18,500 MW of hydroelectricity; it also is managed 
  for flood control, agriculture, navigation, sport and commercial fisheries, 
  log transportation, recreation, wildlife habitat, and urban, industrial, and 
  aboriginal uses. Climate variability affects the total volume and temporal pattern 
  of natural runoff, although binational management agreements have substantially 
  altered this pattern. Any hydrological changes caused by long-term climatic 
  change will have impacts that may affect the management of the system and the 
  nature of conflicts among various users. Recent management and policy changes 
  have led to changes in system operations; fish habitat protection now is regarded 
  as a high priority&#151;on par with hydroelectricity production and flood control 
  (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Climatic change is expected to lead to reductions in annual streamflow. Estimates 
  for three warming scenarios range from a small increase to a decrease of 16% 
  by 2050, with an earlier annual peak, higher winter flows, and lower summer 
  flows (Lettenmaier <i>et al</i>., 1996, 1999; Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 1999; 
  Miles <i>et al</i>., 2000). This would affect system reliability. Results from 
  a reservoir system model for the driest of the three scenarios [based on the 
  Max Planck Institute (MPI) GCM, ECHAM-4] indicate reductions of 15% in reliability 
  for Snake River irrigation, 11% for McNary Dam "biological flow" (to 
  support fish habitat), 14% for firm energy production, and 19% for nonfirm energy 
  production. Reliability for flood control would remain relatively unchanged 
  in this case but would decrease in the wetter scenarios (Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 
  1999; Miles <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Interviews were held in 1997 with water resources managers and other stakeholders 
  in the upstream portion of the Columbia, on the Canadian side. Their responses 
  to the MPI scenario were similar to those obtained from the reservoir system 
  model. For example, they noted that flood risk would not necessarily be reduced 
  because upstream storage facilities may be releasing high discharges for fish 
  habitat protection or other reasons. Similarly, irrigation supply and hydroelectricity 
  production would be reduced because of lower annual flow combined with fish 
  protection requirements. In these circumstances, regional utilities might have 
  to purchase electricity from fossil fuel sources, thereby affecting the region's 
  ability to meet GHG emission targets (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>This case study suggests that despite the high level of development and management 
  in the Columbia basin, vulnerabilities would still exist and impacts could still 
  occur in scenarios of natural streamflow changes caused by global climate change. 
  It also suggests that expanded development of hydroelectric facilities, as a 
  means of reducing GHG emissions, will create considerable challenges to management, 
  given increases in the sensitivity of regional energy supplies and other water-related 
  resources to climate.</p>
