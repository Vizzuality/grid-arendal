<h4>5.2.2.2. Climate or Environment Envelope Models</h4>
<p>Climate envelope models have been used since at least the 1980s (e.g., Box, 
  1981; Busby, 1988). Usually they are based on describing the climate or environment 
  encompassing the current distribution of a species or ecosystem (the environmental 
  envelope or climatic envelope), then mapping the location of this same envelope 
  under a climate change scenario. Sometimes, other forms of bioclimatic correlations 
  or categorization systems are used, but they are based on the same assumption 
  of a close correlation between climate and ecosystems associated with it. These 
  models are useful as a first screening device to point to potential significant 
  changes in ecosystem composition resulting from climate change (e.g., Huntley, 
  1995, and Huntley <i>et al</i>., 1995 for European plants and birds; Somaratne and 
  Dhanapala, 1996, for Sri Lankan plants; Brereton <i>et al</i>., 1995, for Australia 
  mammals; Gignac <i>et al</i>., 1998, for Canadian peatlands; Eeley <i>et al</i>., 1999, for 
  South African woody plants; Iverson and Prasad, 1998, Iverson <i>et al</i>., 1999, 
  for eastern U.S. trees). <br>
</p>
<p>A basic problem with these models is that every species has a "potential 
  niche"&#151;that is, a location in which it could survive and reproduce 
  under the climatic conditions (Kirschbaum <i>et al</i>., 1996). What is observed and 
  used as the basis for the model, however, is the "realized niche," 
  which is a more limited area in which the species is found given the effects 
  of competitors, predators, and diseases. If climate change results in species 
  remaining within their potential niche and the competitors and predators change, 
  the species may be able to survive in situ. In some models, some locations are 
  predicted to have climates that are not encompassed by any of the climate envelopes 
  of any of the vegetation types (Lenihan and Neilson, 1995). Used cautiously, 
  however, the approach can point to priority areas for further study. For example, 
  Lassiter <i>et al</i>. (2000) analyzed data for 200 woody plant species in the eastern 
  United States and found the usual result: a northward shift in predicted range. 
  Excluding water limitations (i.e., allowing increased WUE under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  to compensate for a drier climate), however, most species survive in their current 
  locations. This implies the need to better understand water-use and water-availability 
  relationships under climate change. If species are able to persist, there may 
  be little spread into new regions and thus little vegetation change for many 
  decades.</p>
<p>In a study of 80 species of trees in the United States, using 100,000 plots 
  to describe current distribution and importance, nearly half of the species 
  assessed showed the potential for ecological optima to shift at least 100 km 
  to the north (Iverson <i>et al</i>., 1999). Whether these species will be able to achieve 
  these potential distributions will depend on their migration rates through fragmented 
  landscapes. When Iverson <i>et al</i>. (1999) incorporated a migration model, they 
  found severely limited migration in regions of high forest fragmentation, particularly 
  when the species is low in abundance near the range boundary. <br>
</p>
<p>Kirilenko and Solomon (1998) also have developed a bioclimate correlative model 
  that incorporates a migration component. They demonstrate the importance of 
  incorporating migration by showing that in simulations in which tree migration 
  is delayed, the estimated global terrestrial carbon stock decreases by 7-34 
  Gt C, in contrast to an increase in carbon stock projected under nonlimiting 
  migration (Solomon and Kirilenko, 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Climate envelopes continue to be a useful tool in identifying potential changes 
  in species distributions but are limited by the foregoing problems. emphasis 
  is shifting to more mechanistically based dynamic models of vegetation change 
  that are linked directly to transient outputs from GCMs.</p>
<h4><a name="5223"></a>5.2.2.3. Toward Dynamic Global and Regional Ecosystem Models</h4>
<p>Since the SAR, there have been significant changes in vegetation models and 
  GCMs. A major modeling comparison project&#151;Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling 
  and Analysis Project (VEMAP)&#151; compared six equilibrium models of vegetation 
  distribution and biogeochemistry (VEMAP Members, 1995). In the IPCC Special 
  Report on the Regional Impacts of Climate Change, Neilson <i>et al</i>. (1998) compared 
  two leading vegetation models (MAPSS and BIOME3) run against transient outputs 
  from recent GCMs. <br>
</p>
<p>In MAPPS and BIOME3, potential vegetation is simulated by first calculating 
  carbon flux (plant growth) on the basis of climate and hydrology information 
  derived from the GCM. The models calculate a leaf area index that represents 
  the capacity of the site to support plant canopy. Physiologically based rules 
  are then used to classify the site into a vegetation type (e.g., forest, shrub, 
  or grassland; evergreen or deciduous), leading to allocation to one of 45 vegetation 
  types in MAPSS or 18 in BIOME3. These vegetation models are equilibrium models 
  in that they calculate which vegetation type might be most suited to the climate 
  and do not consider how the existing vegetation type might change to that new 
  type. Details of the model outputs and maps are presented in IPCC (1998) and 
  Neilson <i>et al</i>. (1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Neilson <i>et al</i>. (1998) compared the more recent combination of vegetation and 
  climate models with those being used in the SAR. They found that the newer, 
  transient GCMs produce a cooler climate than earlier versions, mostly because 
  lag effects are simulated and the temperature does not increase to its equilibrium 
  value within the model runs. This means that changes in predicted vegetation 
  tend to be less than those reported in the SAR. Nevertheless, there are significant 
  poleward shifts in cold-limited vegetation types. Vegetation types that are 
  limited by water availability showed more complex changes, depending on the 
  balance between precipitation change, hydrological balance, and physiological 
  adjustment under higher CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
</p>
<p>The newer modeling combinations continue to predict significant potential changes 
  in the distribution of most ecosystem types and increases in the area of tropical 
  and temperate forests, but it cannot be determined whether this potential will 
  be observed until transient (or dynamic) global vegetation models are developed. 
  These models simulate the change in abundance of important species or "functional 
  groups" of species on a year-by-year (or similar) basis in response to 
  the output of the GCM (Cramer <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Such models are being developed and used for assessments of overall carbon 
  storage potential of the land biosphere (Cramer <i>et al</i>., 2001), but at this stage 
  it is too early to place much reliance on the outputs for specific biomes or 
  ecosystems. The results show the sensitivity of ecosystems to the treatment 
  of water use and especially the balance between changes in water availability 
  resulting from climate change (often decreased availability in a warmer climate) 
  and response to higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere (often 
  increased water-use efficiency). This means that model output can vary significantly, 
  depending on the GCM used, because these models have tended to produce different 
  interannual variability in precipitation and thus water availability. Other 
  challenges are to simulate loss of vegetation from disturbances such as fire, 
  blowdown, or pest attacks and migration of species or groups of species to new 
  locations. <br>
</p>
<p>Van Minnen <i>et al</i>. (2000) have shown that by modifying the IMAGE2 model 
  to include unlimited migration, limited migration and no migration result in 
  significantly different patterns of vegetation change, especially in high-latitude 
  regions.</p>
