<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p><b>What are Scenarios and What is Their Role?</b></p>
<p>A scenario is a coherent, internally consistent, and plausible description 
  of a possible future state of the world. Scenarios commonly are required in 
  climate change impact, adaptation, and vulnerability assessments to provide 
  alternative views of future conditions considered likely to influence a given 
  system or activity. A distinction is made between climate scenarios&#151;which 
  describe the forcing factor of focal interest to the Intergovernmental Panel 
  on Climate Change (IPCC)&#151;and nonclimatic scenarios, which provide socioeconomic 
  and environmental "context" within which climate forcing operates. 
  Most assessments of the impacts of future climate change are based on results 
  from impact models that rely on quantitative climate and nonclimatic scenarios 
  as inputs.</p>
<p><b>Types of Scenarios</b></p>
<p><i>Socioeconomic scenarios</i> can serve multiple roles within the assessment 
  of climate impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. Until recently, they have 
  been used much more extensively to project greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than 
  to assess climate vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Most socioeconomic scenarios 
  identify several different topics or domains, such as population or economic 
  activity, as well as background factors such as the structure of governance, 
  social values, and patterns of technological change. Scenarios make it possible 
  to establish baseline socioeconomic vulnerability, pre-climate change; determine 
  climate change impacts; and assess post-adaptation vulnerability.</p>
<p><i>Land-use and land-cover scenarios</i> should be a major component of scenarios 
  for climate change impact and adaptation assessments. A great diversity of land-use 
  and land-cover change scenarios have been constructed. However, most of these 
  scenarios do not address climate change issues explicitly; they focus instead 
  on other issues&#151;for example, food security and carbon cycling. Large improvements 
  have been made since the Second Assessment Report (SAR) in defining current 
  and historic land-use and land-cover patterns, as well as in estimating future 
  scenarios. Integrated assessment models currently are the most appropriate tools 
  for developing land-use and land-cover change scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Environmental scenarios</i> embrace changes in environmental factors other 
  than climate that will occur in the future regardless of climate change. Because 
  these changes could have an important role in modifying the impacts of future 
  climate change, scenarios are required to portray possible future environmental 
  conditions, such as atmospheric composition [e.g., carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 
  tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), acidifying compounds, and ultraviolet (UV)-B 
  radiation]; water availability, use, and quality; and marine pollution. Apart 
  from the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, changes in other environmental 
  factors rarely have been considered alongside climate changes in past impact 
  assessments, although their use is increasing with the emergence of integrated 
  assessment methods.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Climate scenarios</i> of three main types have been employed in impact assessments: 
  incremental scenarios, analog scenarios, and climate model-based scenarios. 
  Of these, the most common use outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) 
  and usually are constructed by adjusting a baseline climate (typically based 
  on regional observations of climate over a reference period such as 1961-1990) 
  by the absolute or proportional change between the simulated present and future 
  climates. Most recent impact studies have constructed scenarios on the basis 
  of transient GCM outputs, although some still apply earlier equilibrium results. 
  Regional detail is obtained from the coarse-scale outputs of GCMs by using three 
  main methods: simple interpolation, statistical downscaling, and high-resolution 
  dynamic modeling. The simple method, which reproduces the GCM pattern of change, 
  is the most widely applied in scenario development. In contrast, the statistical 
  and modeling approaches can produce local climate changes that are different 
  from the large-scale GCM estimates. More research is needed to evaluate the 
  value added to impact studies of such regionalization exercises. One reason 
  for this caution is the large uncertainty of GCM projections, which requires 
  further quantification through model intercomparisons, new model simulations, 
  and pattern-scaling methods. Such research could facilitate future evaluation 
  of impacts in a risk assessment framework.</p>
<p><i>Sea-level rise scenarios</i> are required to evaluate a diverse range of 
  threats to human settlements, natural ecosystems, and landscape in coastal zones. 
  Relative sea-level scenarios (i.e., sea-level rise with reference to movements 
  of the local land surface) are of the most interest for impact and adaptation 
  assessments. Tide gauge and wave height records of 50 years or more are required, 
  along with information on severe weather and coastal processes, to establish 
  baseline levels or trends. Although some components of future sea-level rise 
  can be modeled regionally, using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, the most common 
  method of obtaining scenarios is to apply global mean estimates from simple 
  models. Changes in the occurrence of extreme events such as storm surges and 
  wave set-up, which can lead to major coastal impacts, sometimes are investigated 
  by superimposing historically observed events onto rising mean sea level. More 
  recently, some studies have begun to express future sea-level rise in probabilistic 
  terms, enabling rising levels to be evaluated in terms of the risk that they 
  will exceed a critical threshold of impact.</p>
