<h3>13.1.6. Socioeconomic Scenarios for Europe </h3>
<p>The four socioeconomic global futures (or SRES scenarios) described in Chapter 
  3 of this assessment have been characterized for Europe in the European ACACIA 
  study (Jordan et al., 2000), and are summarized below: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> Under a "World Market" (A1) scenario, the world becomes increasingly globalized, 
    and materialist-consumerist social values predominate. Global societal values 
    are primarily technocentric and short-termist. Nature therefore is assumed 
    to be largely resilient to human stress. The emphasis is on pursuing economic 
    growth in the narrow sense rather than sustainable development. Although rising 
    income levels will make everyone in Europe richer, the poorest will gain relatively 
    little. The EU functions as a single interconnected market, functionally integrated 
    with other regional markets (e.g., in Asia and North America). 
  <li> Under a "Global Sustainability" (B1) scenario, Europe is run along more 
    communitarian lines and within environmental resource limits. There is a strong 
    emphasis on finding international solutions to globally interconnected problems. 
    Thus, EU member states pool more and more of their sovereignty to address 
    common environmental problems, the causes of which are considered to lie in 
    the basic structure of society. The role of international institutions, including 
    the EU, will extend from simply regulating environmental problems to tackling 
    social inequality and social exclusion through adoption of social programs. 
  <li> In a "Provincial Enterprise" (A2) scenario, Europe is much more heterogeneous. 
    Increasingly, the organization of society is dictated by short-term consumerist 
    values. More policy decisions are taken at a national and subnational level. 
    Europe adopts more protectionist economic and trade policies, which constrain 
    innovation and stifle economic development, particularly in developing countries. 
    Growth in global GDP is more modest than under the A1 scenario, and global 
    inequality grows. Declining equity within and between member states of the 
    EU produces tension and social exclusion. This typifies the uneasy tension 
    in this scenario between the simultaneous desire for "free markets" (consumerist 
    values) and protection of national state sovereignty. Politicians prioritize 
    demands such as protecting the national economy and meeting short-term consumer 
    demands for growth over environmental quality. 
  <li> In a "Local Sustainability" (B2) scenario, Europe is more committed to 
    solving environmental problems by applying solutions that are attuned to local 
    needs and circumstances. Thus, the dominant value system is more communitarian 
    and ecocentric in nature, with greater commitment to longer term, strategic 
    planning. In a sense, the shift in governance down to the local level accords 
    with the principle of subsidiarity. National governments therefore are left 
    to perform residual functions that cannot be undertaken at the subnational 
    level. Small firms thrive under these conditions, whereas multinationals struggle 
    to realign themselves to local needs. Overall, the world (including Europe) 
    is more heterogeneous. Because of the lack of coordinated regional action, 
    however, relative inequality may increase as local problems receive higher 
    priority than those in other regions. Significantly, the environment benefits 
    under this scenario, but not nearly as much as under B1 because of the limited 
    extent of spatial coordination.

      <p><b>Figure 13-5: </b>Scatter plot depicting scaled outputs of mean winter 
        (left panels) and summer (right panels) temperature and precipitation 
        change over land grid boxes representing Spain (top), Sweden (middle), 
        and Poland (bottom) from each of seven GCM simulations (GFDL simulations 
        are not shown because they extend only to 2025). Lines connect four points 
        for each GCM simulation, each point representing standardized regional 
        changes in climate from the GCM, linearly scaled according to global warming 
        from each of the four ACACIA scenarios. The order of points along a line 
        from the origin is the same for all plots: B1-low, B2-mid, A1-mid, A2-high. 
        Also plotted are 1 and 2 standard deviation limits from 1,400-year HadCM2 
        unforced simulation, which is used to indicate natural multi-decadal variability.
