<h3><a name="1726"></a>17.2.6. Water Resources</h3>
<p>Availability of water resources is a limiting factor for economic and social 
  development in small island states. Many such countries rely almost entirely 
  on a single source of supply, such as groundwater (Barbados, Antigua, The Bahamas, 
  Kiribati), rainwater (Tuvalu, northern atolls of Cook Islands, and the Maldives), 
  surface reservoirs and imports (Singapore), or rivers and other surface flows 
  (Seychelles, Dominica).</p>
<p>Water supply is most vulnerable in the atoll states of the Pacific, where water 
  supply is sensitive to precipitation patterns and changes in storm tracks (Salinger 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1995). Captured rainwater is stored in cisterns; the only backup 
  reserve for these islands is a thin wedge of fresh groundwater that sits on 
  top of the saltwater lens. A reduction in precipitation coupled with sea-level 
  rise would not only cause a diminution of the volume of potable water but would 
  reduce the size of the narrow freshwater lens (Amadore <i>et al.,</i> 1996). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The situation is equally critical in the low limestone islands of the eastern 
  Caribbean, where seasonality of rainfall (a marked dry and wet season regime) 
  is pronounced. On islands such as Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and 
  Barbados, more than 65% of total annual rainfall may be recorded in the wet 
  season, which spans the 6-month period of June to December. Moreover, most of 
  the rainfall is strongly associated with the genesis and passage of easterly 
  waves, tropical depressions, and storms (Gray, 1993; Nurse <i>et al.,</i> 1998). 
  Thus, changes in the occurrence of these heavy rainfall events will certainly 
  impact the water supply of many Caribbean islands. The situation is further 
  exacerbated in Barbados, where recent research has shown that groundwater recharge 
  is restricted to the three wettest months of the year, and only 15-30 % 
  of annual rainfall reaches the aquifer (Jones <i>et al., </i>1998). </p>
<p>Reduced availability of adequate water supply in a changing climate also poses 
  a potential threat to the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta. Because 
  these two countries already experience water shortages (Nicholls and Hoozemans, 
  1996), and given a projected decrease in mean summer precipitation over the 
  Mediterranean Sea region (IPCC, 1998), the water resources of these states could 
  be placed under considerable pressure in the future (Tables <a href="624.htm#tab172">17-2</a> 
  and <a href="624.htm#tab173">17-3</a>). The threat is equally strong in some 
  parts of the eastern Caribbean. Within the past few decades in Dominica, for 
  instance, an apparent tendency toward more extended periods of drought is well 
  correlated with reduced flows in the Castle Comfort, Roseau, Layou, and Geneva 
  Rivers (Government of Commonwealth of Dominica, 2000). Because rivers are the 
  main source of potable and irrigation water on the island and are also harnessed 
  for power generation, declining flows have become a matter of serious national 
  concern.</p>
<p>Climate change can present additional water management and related challenges. 
  Such challenges may arise from a variety of sources, including increased flood 
  risks and impeded drainage and the presence of elevated water tables&#151;which 
  may pose special engineering problems. It is projected that on Andros island, 
  the Bahamas, where the water table presently is only 30 cm below the surface, 
  high evaporation rates and increasing brackishness will eventuate with continued 
  sea-level rise (Martin and Bruce, 1999). Similar projections also have been 
  made for Cuba, where underground water supplies already are stressed (Planos 
  and Barros, 1999). For many small island states, the prospect of salinity intrusion 
  into the freshwater lens would be a matter of great concern. In many of these 
  islands where salinization from overpumping of aquifers is already occurring 
  (e.g., The Bahamas and Barbados), sea-level rise would compound the risk. In 
  some cases, higher salinity would be experienced not only in coastal aquifers 
  but also inland at freshwater pumping plants as the salty groundwater rises. 
  Singh (1997a,b) has reported a recent increase in salinity levels for several 
  coastal aquifers in Trinidad and Tobago in the southern Caribbean, attributable 
  mainly to rapid drawdown exacerbated by sea-level rise.</p>
<p>There now is substantial evidence to support the view that precipitation variability 
  in various parts of the world is linked to ENSO events. During the 1982-1983 
  ENSO event, rainfall in many parts of the western Pacific was a mere 10-30% 
  of the long-term mean average (Falkland, 1992). More specifically, it is well 
  established that ENSO has a strong influence on rainfall patterns in the tropics 
  and low-latitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere (Shea, 1994; Whetton <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1996). In the Caribbean islands, droughts appear to be more frequent 
  in El Ni&ntilde;o years, whereas conditions tend to be wetter in La Ni&ntilde;a 
  years. The devastating drought in the region in 1998 coincided with what is 
  believed to be the strongest El Ni&ntilde;o signal on record. ENSO-related droughts 
  also are known to occur in the low-lying atolls of the tropical Pacific. Thus, 
  in countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands 
  where rainwater is the main source of supply, more frequent and intense ENSO 
  events will impose further stress on already meager water resources (Meehl and 
  Washington, 1996); other islands in the central and eastern tropical Pacific 
  will experience heavy rains (Jones <i>et al.,</i> 1999).</p>
<p>Realistically, the options available to many small islands for reducing the 
  adverse effects of climate change on water availability are limited. This implies 
  that greater urgency and emphasis will have to be placed on improving water 
  resource management efforts, including inventorying of resources and rational 
  and equitable allocation. Implementation of more efficient rainwater harvesting 
  methods, efficient leak detection and repair, use of water-saving devices, and 
  aggressive recycling efforts are strategies worth considering. Desalination 
  also is becoming an increasingly attractive option, especially where the necessary 
  technical and financial capacity is available and in cases in which more traditional 
  strategies are inadequate or not feasible (e.g., in Singapore, Malta, Cyprus, 
  Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada). As part of 
  their long-term adaptation strategy, these water-scarce islands might wish to 
  include "no-regrets" measures, which will promote sustainability with 
  or without climate change. Some countries may even wish to consider application 
  of market-based systems to allocate water supplies, which could result in less 
  wasteful practices under current conditions and thus enable water users to more 
  efficiently adapt to climate change (Amadore<i> et al.,</i> 1996).</p>
