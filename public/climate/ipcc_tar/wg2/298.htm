<h3>6.5.2. Economic Costs of Sea-Level Rise</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, several studies examined the cost of sea-level rise in 
  the United States, based on uniform national response strategies of holding 
  back the sea (Titus <i>et al.</i>, 1992) or not holding back the sea (Yohe, 1990). 
  A series of nationwide studies in other countries (see Bijlsma <i>et al.</i>, 1996) 
  followed much the same approach. Turner <i>et al.</i> (1995) attempted to assess the 
  cost of sea-level rise in general. Yohe <i>et al.</i> (1996) analyzed the economic 
  cost of sea-level rise for developed property in the United States. They conclude 
  that their cumulative figure of US$20.4 billion (1990 US$) cumulative is much 
  lower than earlier estimates because those estimates had not considered offsetting 
  factors, such as the cost-reducing potential of natural, market-based, adaptation 
  measures or the efficiency of discrete decisions to protect (or not to protect) 
  small tracts of property on the basis of individual economic merit. In most 
  analyses, those "offsetting factors," or adaptations, are shore protection 
  works. The expected economic cost of protection or abandonment in the United 
  States also has been assessed (Yohe and Schlesinger, 1998).</p>
<p>Saizar (1997) assesses the potential impacts of a 0.5-m sea-level rise on the 
  coast of Montevideo, Uruguay. Given no adaptive response, the cost of such a 
  rise is estimated to be US$23 million, with a shoreline recession of 56 m and 
  loss of only 6.8 ha of land. Olivo (1997) determined the potential economic 
  impacts of a sea-level rise of 0.5 m on the coast of Venezuela. At six study 
  sites, he identified land and infrastructure at risk&#151;such as oil infrastructure, 
  urban areas, and tourist infrastructure&#151;and, after evaluating four scenarios, 
  concludes that Venezuela cannot afford the costs of sea-level rise, either in 
  terms of land and infrastructure lost under a no-protection policy or in terms 
  of the costs involved in any of three protection policies. In Poland, Zeider 
  (1997) estimates the total cost of land-at-loss at US$30 billion; the cost of 
  full protection for the 2,200 km of coast would be US$6 billion.</p>
<p>Several different methods have been used to estimate economic costs. Yohe and 
  Neumann (1997) focus attention on the cost-benefit procedures applied by coastal 
  planners to evaluate shoreline protection projects in relation to sea-level 
  rise. They develop three alternative adaptive responses to the inundation threat 
  from climate-induced sea-level rise: cost-benefit with adaptation foresight 
  (CBWAF), cost-benefit absent adaptation (CBAA), and protection guaranteed (PG). 
  On economic grounds, CBWAF became the preferred option; CBAA conforms most closely 
  with the routine application of existing procedures. "Adaptation foresight" 
  in Yohe and Neumann's cost-benefit procedures assumes that erosion resulting 
  from sea-level rise is a gradual process and that storm impacts do not change 
  as sea level rises. West and Dowlatabadi (1999) suggest, however, that although 
  a rise in sea level may be gradual and predictable, the effects of storms on 
  coastal shorelines and structures are often stochastic and uncertain, in part 
  because of sea-level rise effects.</p>
<p>Sea-level rise can increase the damage caused by storms because mean water 
  level (the base level for storm effects) is higher, waves can attack higher 
  on the shore profile, and coastal erosion often is accelerated, bringing structures 
  nearer the shoreline and potentially removing protection offered by dunes and 
  other protective features. The Heinz Center (2000) estimates that roughly 1,500 
  homes in the United States will be lost to coastal erosion each year for several 
  decades, at a cost to property owners of US$530 million yr<sup>-1</sup>. Most of the losses 
  over the next 60 years will be in low-lying areas that also are subject to flooding, 
  although some damage will be along eroding bluffs or cliffs. West <i>et al.</i> (2001) 
  estimate that the increase in storm damage because of sea-level rise increases 
  the direct damages of sea-level rise from erosion of the shoreline by 5%, but 
  storm damage could be as much as 20% of other sea-level rise damages. They also 
  developed a method for evaluating the effects of investor decisions to repair 
  storm damage on the net economic impacts of rising sea level in the United States. 
  Neumann <i>et al.</i> (2000) have estimated that a 0.5-m sea-level rise by 2100 could 
  cause cumulative impacts to U.S. coastal property of US$20 billion to US$150 
  billion and that more extensive damage could result if climate change increases 
  storm frequency or intensity.</p>
<p>Morisugi <i>et al.</i> (1995) attempt to evaluate the household damage cost in Japan 
  from increased storm surges and the potential benefit generated by countermeasures, 
  using a microeconomic approach. In this approach, household utility is expressed 
  as a function of disaster occurrence probability, income, and other variables, 
  and the change of utility level from sea-level rise and/or countermeasures is 
  translated into monetary terms. For a 0.5-m sea-level rise, the damage cost 
  without countermeasures in Japan would be about US$3.4 billion yr<sup>-1</sup>, based on 
  the comparison of the utility level between no sea-level rise and a 0.5-m sea-level 
  rise without countermeasures. When the utility level is calculated for the case 
  with countermeasures, the damage cost is reduced to about -US$1.3 billion 
  yr<sup>-1</sup>, which means that a benefit is created. Therefore, the benefit created 
  by countermeasures for a 0.5-m sea-level rise, which is defined as the decrease 
  of damage cost, would be about US$4.7 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> at the national level. Because 
  the annual expense for countermeasures is estimated to be about US$1.9 billion 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Mimura <i>et al.</i>, 1998), the countermeasures are still beneficial after expenses 
  are considered. This and other examples given here suggest that more robust 
  assessments of the economic impacts of sea-level rise are possible and that 
  they can improve the quality of adaptation strategies.</p>

<h3>6.5.3. Impacts on Coastal Infrastructure</h3>
<p>A large portion of the human population now lives in coastal areas, and the 
  rate of population growth in these areas is higher than average (Cohen <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1997; Gommes <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Many large cities are located near 
  the coast (e.g., Tokyo, Shanghai, Jakarta, Bombay, New York), and Nicholls and 
  Mimura (1998) have argued that the future of the subsiding megacities in Asia, 
  particularly those on deltas, is among the most challenging issues relating 
  to sea-level rise. People in developed coastal areas rely heavily on infrastructure 
  to obtain economic, social, and cultural benefits from the sea and to ensure 
  their safety against natural hazards such as high waves, storm surges, and tsunamis. 
  Their well-being is supported by systems of infrastructure that include transportation 
  facilities, energy supply systems, disaster prevention facilities, and resorts 
  in coastal areas. Significant impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on 
  these facilities would have serious consequences (see <a href="305.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>). This analysis applies not only in highly developed nations but in many 
  developing economies and small island states (Nunn and Mimura, 1997). The vulnerability 
  of waste facilities, septic systems, water quality and supply, and roads is 
  a particular concern in many places (Solomon and Forbes, 1999).</p>
<p>Mimura <i>et al.</i> (1998) summarize Japanese studies on the impacts on infrastructure. 
  Several studies suggested that disaster prevention facilities such as coastal 
  dikes, water gates, and drainage systems and coastal protection structures such 
  as seawalls, breakwaters, and groins will become less functional because of 
  sea-level rise and may lose their stability. A common concern relates to the 
  bearing capacity of the soil foundation for structures. For instance, the increased 
  water table resulting from sea-level rise decreases the bearing capacity of 
  the soil foundation and increases the possibility of liquefaction, which results 
  in higher instability of coastal infrastructures to earthquakes (Shaw <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998a). In the United Kingdom, sea defenses and shore protection works around 
  4,300 km of coast cost approximately US$500 million yr<sup>-1</sup> to maintain at present&#151; 
  a figure that Turner <i>et al.</i> (1998) suggest will continue to rise in the future.</p>
<p>Port facilities are another type of infrastructure that will be affected by 
  climate change and sea-level rise. Higher sea level probably will decrease the 
  effectiveness of breakwaters against wave forces, and wharves may have to be 
  raised to avoid inundation. When such effects are anticipated, countermeasures 
  can be implemented to maintain function and stability. Therefore, the real impacts 
  will occur as an additional expenditure to reinforce the infrastructure. The 
  total expenditure to keep the present level of functions and stability for about 
  1,000 Japanese ports is estimated to be US$110 billion for a 1-m sea-level rise 
  (Mimura <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
