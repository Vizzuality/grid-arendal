<h2>18.4. Planned Adaptations and Evaluation of Policy Options</h2>
<p>This section considers planned, mainly (but not exclusively) anticipatory adaptations, 
  undertaken or directly influenced by governments or collectives as a public 
  policy initiative. These adaptations represent conscious policy options or response 
  strategies to concerns about climate change (Benioff <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Fankhauser, 
  1996; Smith, 1997; Pielke, 1998; UNEP, 1998). Public adaptation initiatives 
  may be direct or indirect, such as when they encourage or facilitate private 
  actions (Leary, 1999). Planned adaptation by public agencies represents an alternative 
  or complementary response strategy to mitigation (of net GHG emissions). Analyses 
  of such planned adaptations are essentially normative exercises involving identification 
  of possible policy strategies and evaluation of the relative merit of alternatives, 
  as an aid to policy development.</p>
<a name="1841"></a> 
<h3>18.4.1. Rationale and Objectives for Planned Adaptations</h3>
<p>Numerous reasons have been given for pursuing planned adaptations at this time 
  (see <a href="#tab18-4">Table 18-4</a>). Public adaptation initiatives are regarded 
  not as a substitute for reducing GHG emissions but as a necessary strategy to 
  manage the impacts of climate change (Burton, 1996; Pielke, 1998). Adaptation 
  can yield benefits regardless of the uncertainty and nature of climate change 
  (Ali, 1999). Fankhauser <i>et al.</i> (1998) and Leary (1999) outline rationales 
  for public adaptation policies or projects relative to relying on private actions. 
  Leary concludes that "we cannot rely solely or heavily on autonomous adjustments 
  of private agents to protect public goods and should examine public policy responses 
  to do so." Planned anticipatory adaptation, as recognized in the UNFCCC 
  (Article 3.3), is aimed at reducing a system's vulnerability by diminishing 
  risk or improving adaptive capacity.</p>

<p>There has been work on the process by which public agencies might or should 
  undertake planned adaptation strategies, particularly noting the steps to be 
  followed, relationships with other policy and management objectives, and the 
  criteria with which options might be evaluated (Louisse and Van der Meulen, 
  1991; Carter <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Smith and Lenhart, 1996; Stakhiv, 1996; Major 
  and Frederick, 1997; Smith, 1997). Klein and Tol (1997) identify five generic 
  objectives of adaptation:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Increasing robustness of infrastructural designs and long-term investments&#151;for 
    example, by extending the range of temperature or precipitation a system can 
    withstand without failure and changing the tolerance of loss or failure (e.g., 
    by increasing economic reserves or by insurance)</li>
  <li>Increasing the flexibility of vulnerable managed systems&#151;for example, 
    by allowing mid-term adjustments (including change of activities or location) 
    and reducing economic lifetimes (including increasing depreciation)</li>
  <li>Enhancing the adaptability of vulnerable natural systems&#151;for example, 
    by reducing other (nonclimatic) stresses and removing barriers to migration 
    (including establishing eco-corridors)</li>
  <li> Reversing trends that increase vulnerability (also termed "maladaptation")&#151;for 
    example, by introducing setbacks for development in vulnerable areas such 
    as floodplains and coastal zones</li>
  <li> Improving societal awareness and preparedness&#151;for example, by informing 
    the public of the risks and possible consequences of climate change and setting 
    up early-warning systems.</li>
</ol>

<h3>18.4.2. Identification of Adaptation Policy Options</h3>
<p>Research addressing future adaptations to climate change tends to be normative, 
  suggesting anticipatory adaptive strategies to be implemented through public 
  policy. Generally, such adaptation recommendations are based on forecasts of 
  expected (though still largely unpredictable) climate change. Recommended adaptations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tend to be in response to changes in long-term mean climate, though more 
    specific elements of climate change (e.g., sea-level change) gain focus when 
    sector-specific adaptations are proposed (e.g., integrated coastal zone management) 
    (Al-Farouq and Huq, 1996; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1996), and some studies specifically 
    examine potential adaptations to variability and extreme events (e.g., Appendi 
    and Liverman, 1996; Yang, 1996; Yim, 1996).</li>
  <li>Range in scope from very broad strategies for adaptation (e.g., enhancing 
    decisionmakers' awareness of climatic change and variability) to recommendations 
    of sector-specific policy. Sectors receiving particular attention include 
    water resources, coastal resources, agriculture, and forest resources (Smith 
    and Lenhart, 1996; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Hartig <i>et al.</i>, 1997; 
    Mendelsohn and Bennett, 1997).</li>
  <li>Tend to be regionally focused (Smith and Lenhart, 1996), in recognition 
    of the fact that vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is highly 
    spatially variable. There is interest in developing countries and nations 
    with economies in transition, given their greater reliance on natural systems-based 
    economic activity (such as agriculture) (e.g., Magalh&atilde;es, 1996; Smith 
    <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Kelly and Adger, 1999). </li>
</ul>
<p>Because no single set of adaptive policy recommendations can be universally 
  appropriate, several studies suggest means by which proposed adaptations may 
  be selected and evaluated. At a very basic level, the success of potential adaptations 
  is seen to depend on the flexibility or effectiveness of the measures, such 
  as their ability to meet stated objectives given a range of future climate scenarios 
  (through either robustness or resilience), and their potential to produce benefits 
  that outweigh costs (financial, physical, human, or otherwise) (Smith and Lenhart, 
  1996). Clearly, these are difficult criteria to assess, given the complexity 
  of adaptation measures, the variable sensitivities and capacities of regions, 
  and uncertainties associated with climate change and variability. Some research 
  (e.g., Carter, 1996; Smith and Lenhart, 1996; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1996; de 
  Lo&euml; and Kreutzwiser, 2000) offers supplementary characteristics of, or 
  criteria for, the identification of adaptations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The measure generates benefits to the economy, environment, or society under 
    current conditions (i.e., independent of climate change).</li>
  <li>The measure addresses high-priority adaptation issues such as irreversible 
    or catastrophic impacts of climate change (e.g., species extinction), long-term 
    planning for adaptation (e.g., infrastructure), and unfavorable trends (e.g., 
    deforestation, which may inhibit future adaptive flexibility).</li>
  <li>The measure targets current areas of opportunity (e.g., land purchases, 
    revision of national environmental action or development plans, research and 
    development).</li>
  <li>The measure is feasible&#151;that is, its adoption is not significantly 
    constrained by institutional, social/cultural, financial, or technological 
    barriers.</li>
  <li>The measure is consistent with, or even complementary to, adaptation or 
    mitigation efforts in other sectors.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
