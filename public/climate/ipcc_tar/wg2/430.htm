<h4>11.2.1.4. Drylands </h4>
<p>Precipitation is scarce and has a high annual variance in dryland areas. Very 
  high daily temperature variance is recorded with frequent sand storms, dust 
  ghost, and intense sunshine. Arid plants usually belong to drought escaper, 
  drought evader, drought resister, or drought endurer categories. Evaporative 
  losses and water limitations are the most prominent factors dictating animal 
  life in arid environments. Low rainfall dictates the formation of shallow or 
  extremely sallow soils that often are characterized by high content of airborne 
  particles and small fractions of rock-erosion elements. Most of the soils are 
  poor in or completely devoid of organic matter, and the nutrient pools of the 
  soils are low. Apparently, humans not only utilize the ecosystem services of 
  this region but are also influencing the evolution of some of its important 
  biotic elements. In Mongolia, for example, while soil fertility has decreased 
  by about 20% in the past 40 years, about one-third of the pasturage has been 
  overgrazed and 5 Mha of arid land have constantly been threatened by moving 
  sands (Khuldorj et al., 1998). Soils exposed to degradation as a result of poor 
  land management could become infertile as a result of climate change. Temperature 
  increases would have negative impacts on natural vegetation in desert zones. 
  Plants with surface root systems, which utilize mostly precipitation moisture, 
  will be vulnerable. Climate change also would have negative impacts on sheep 
  breeding and lamb wool productivity.</p>
<p>Just as shifts in vegetation belts are expected in non-drylands, in the drylands 
  of Asia a shift in dryland types is expected as a result of climate change. 
  Drylands are ranked along an aridity index, in relation to the ratio of precipitation 
  to potential evapotranspiration (i.e., to a gradient in soil moisture available 
  for driving production). Because soil moisture is likely to decline in this 
  region, the least-dry land type (dry subhumid drylands) are expected to become 
  semi-arid, and semi-arid land is expected to become arid. It is notable that 
  population pressure on dryland resources is reduced with increasing aridity, 
  but resistance to degradation and resilience following degradation also is reduced 
  with increasing aridity. Therefore, semi-arid drylands, which are intermediate 
  in aridity as compared to arid drylands and dry subhumid ones, are most susceptible 
  to becoming further desertified (Safriel, 1995). Because semi-arid drylands 
  are very common among Asian drylands, large areas will become not only dry but 
  also desertified as a result of climate change,.</p>
