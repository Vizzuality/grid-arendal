<h4><a name="162825"></a>16.2.8.2.5. Fisheries</h4>
<p>High-latitude marine fisheries are very productive. For example, those in the 
  northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea contribute more than 28% to total 
  world landings of fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. In some northern countries, 
  fisheries and fish products account for a large proportion of gross domestic 
  product. In Greenland, the shrimp industry contributed more than 30% to GDP 
  in 1986. Landings of fish in the Northwest Territories and in Nunavut, in the 
  commercial and the subsistence sectors of the economy, are valued at CDN$12 
  million.</p>
<p>Shifts in oceanic circulation associated with global warming are likely to 
  affect the distribution of commercially important fish and their migration routes 
  (Buch <i>et al</i>., 1994; Vilhjalmsson, 1997). For example, the first catches of two 
  species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhnchus nerka, O. gorbuscha) recently have been 
  made in estuaries on Banks Island, Canada. These locations are well outside 
  the known range for these Pacific species (Babaluk <i>et al</i>., 2000). Changes in 
  ocean currents, nutrient availability, salinity, and the temperature of ocean 
  waters can be expected to influence the disposition of larval and juvenile organisms, 
  the growth rates of individuals, and the population structure of different fish 
  species (Otterson and Loeng, 2000). For example, recruitment appears to be significantly 
  better in warm years (Loeng, 1989), an example of which is increased landings 
  of cod (Gadus morhua) associated with warmer air and surface water temperatures 
  (Brander, 1996). During a warm phase between the 1920s and the 1960s, Norwegian 
  herring fed in Icelandic waters but disappeared when the water temperature cooled 
  by 1&deg;C (Vilhjalmsson, 1997). Quinn and Marshall (1989) report positive correlations 
  between salmon returns and reduced sea ice. However, species that are adapted 
  to cold water, such as the Greenland turbot and the Alaskan King crab, declined 
  in numbers during these warm phases, although other factors also contributed 
  to the decline of crab stocks (Weller and Lange, 1999). However, the underlying 
  mechanisms that account for changes in population sizes are poorly understood. 
  This topic is a high research priority, particularly because plankton production 
  and trophic interactions may be significantly altered by changes in climate. 
  Research and management advice for fish stocks is provided by the International 
  Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). This authority and others face 
  formidable challenges if the distributions of fish populations change in response 
  to global warming (H&oslash;nneland <i>et al</i>., 1999; Freese, 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="162826"></a>16.2.8.2.6. Reindeer husbandry</h4>
<p>Husbandry of different subspecies of Rangifer tarandus is widely practiced 
  in different regions of the Arctic, particularly in Eurasia. Between 1991 and 
  1997, Russia's domestic reindeer stock declined from 2.3 million to 1.6 
  million animals. Whether climate change contributed to this decline is uncertain 
  (Weller and Lange, 1999), but climate warming is likely to alter husdandry practices. 
  Concerns include the presence of deep snow with an ice surface that stops animals 
  from obtaining forage, lichens and graminoids that are ice-covered, destruction 
  of vegetation as a result of "overgrazing," exposure of soil that 
  encourages establishment of southerly weedy species under a warmer climate (Vilchek, 
  1997), and an increased likelihood of damage from more frequent tundra fires.</p>
