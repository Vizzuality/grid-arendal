<h4>5.6.2.2 Changes in Disturbance Regimes </h4>
<p>At the landscape scale, changes in the disturbance regime introduce instabilities 
  in forest age-class distributions (Bhatti et al., 2000) and eventually in the 
  distribution of plant species. If changes in disturbances are caused or accompanied 
  by changes in environmental conditions, the responses of the forest ecosystem 
  can be very complex. Changes in disturbance regimes, spatially and over time, 
  can be exacerbated or mitigated by human activities (e.g., by fire ignitions 
  and fire suppression). </p>
<h4><a name="56221"></a>5.6.2.2.1. Pressures from fires</h4>
<p>Large areas of mixed savanna-woodlands in dry tropical zones of Africa, South 
  America, Australia, and large areas of tropical humid forests burn every year 
  (WRI, 2000). These fires are part of the natural seasonal cycle of growth, decay, 
  and combustion and are ignited by lightning strikes. However, humans have long 
  played a significant role in modifying fire regimes by changing the season and 
  frequency of burning and consequently vegetation composition and structure (Goldammer 
  and Price, 1998). During the 1990s in tropical humid areas, major fires have 
  occurred in the Brazilian Amazon, Mexico, and Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra) 
  and were particularly severe in 1997-1998 during an El Ni&ntilde;o episode 
  (FAO, 1997a; Nepstad et al., 1999). Fire also is a serious threat to native 
  forests in many parts of tropical and nontropical developing countries. China, 
  for example, suffered large losses in a single fire event in 1987, with 1 Mha 
  (Anon., 1987) to 1.3 Mha (Cahoon et al., 1994) burned. Fire prevention and suppression 
  capability depends on available infrastructure such as imagery, roads, machinery, 
  and human capital. In general, developed countries are better able to manage 
  fire in regions with roads; developing countries may lack one or all of the 
  factors. </p>
<p>The Indonesian fires of 1997-1998 were associated with a significant, 
  but not unique, drought over much of the region. Estimates of the area burned 
  vary from 96,000 ha to more than 8 Mha (Harwell, 2000). Most of this area was 
  not forest but scrub, grassland, and agricultural lands. Almost no fires occurred 
  deep within undisturbed primary forest; most were associated with land-clearing 
  for new settlements or plantations or with logging operations. The most persistent 
  fires were seven clusters of fires along the edges of degraded peat-swamp forests 
  in southern Sumatera and Kalimantan (Legg and Laumonier, 1999). The extent and 
  persistence of these fires, and similar fires in Brazil, show the importance 
  of interaction between climate and human actions in determining the structure 
  and composition of tropical forests, land-use patterns, and carbon emissions. 
</p>
<p>In the boreal zone of Canada, there has been a marked increase in fire since 
  about 1970, after a 5-decade decrease (Kurz et al., 1995). The area of boreal 
  forest burned annually in western North America has doubled in the past 20 years 
  (0.28% in the 1970s to 0.57% in the 1990s), in parallel with the observed warming 
  trend in the region (Kasischke et al., 1999), despite much improved detection 
  and suppression technology. Similar trends have been noted for Eurasian forests 
  (Shvidenko and Nilsson, 1994, 1997; Kasischke et al., 1999). Whether these changes 
  are the result of human-induced climate change or are a result of natural climatic 
  variability is not certain (Clark et al., 1996; Flannigan et al., 1998). Changes 
  in the disturbance regime over periods of decades result in changes in forest 
  age-class distribution to younger versus old forests (Kurz and Apps, 1999). 
  These changes will reduce the landscape-averaged biomass stock and dead organic 
  matter pools, including soils (Bhatti et al., 2000). Hence, changes in NBP occur 
  on scales of years to decades.</p>
<p>Fire frequency is expected to increase with human-induced climate change, especially 
  where precipitation remains the same or is reduced (Stocks et al., 1998). A 
  general but moderate increase in precipitation, together with increased productivity, 
  also could favor generation of more flammable fine fuels. Miranda (1994) suggests 
  an increase in risk, severity, and frequency of forest fires in Europe. Stocks 
  et al. (1998) used four GCMs and found similar predictions of an earlier start 
  to the fire season and significant increases in the area experiencing high to 
  extreme fire danger in Canada and Russia. Some regions may experience little 
  change or even decreases in fire frequency, where precipitation increases or 
  temperature does not rise (as in eastern Canada, where regional cooling has 
  led to decreased fire frequency&#151;Flannigan et al., 1998). In most regions, 
  there is likely to be an increased risk of forest fires, resulting in a change 
  in vegetation structure that in turn exacerbates this risk (Cramer and Steffen, 
  1997). </p>
<p>During the past decade, forest fires in developed countries generally have 
  become smaller, with the exception of the former Soviet Union (FAO, 1997a), 
  Canada (Kurz et al., 1995; Kurz and Apps, 1999), and the United States (Sampson 
  and DeCoster, 1998). Where observed, the slight decline in forest areas burned 
  per year is believed to be in part a result of improved prevention, detection, 
  and control of fires. However, many such protected forests have increasing fuel 
  loads and an abundance of dead and dying trees that eventually will make them 
  more susceptible to catastrophic fires (e.g., Sampson and DeCoster, 1998). Several 
  authors suggest that climate change is likely to increase the number of days 
  with severe burning conditions, prolong the fire season, and increase lightning 
  activity, all of which lead to probable increases in fire frequency and areas 
  burned (Price and Rind, 1994; Goldammer and Price, 1998; Stocks et al., 1998).</p>
