<h3>19.8.2. What does Each Reason for Concern Indicate? </h3>
<p>Looking across these different reasons for concern, what can we conclude about 
  what change in global average temperature is "dangerous"? A few general 
  caveats apply:</p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> In spite of many studies on climate change impacts, there is still substantial 
    uncertainty about how effective adaptation will be (and could be) in ameliorating 
    negative effects of climate change and taking advantage of positive effects.<br>
  <li> The effect of changes in baseline conditions, such as economic growth and 
    development of new technologies, that could reduce vulnerability has not been 
    adequately considered in most impact studies.<br>
  <li> Most impact studies assess the effects of a stable climate, so our understanding 
    of what rates of change may be dangerous is limited. 
</ul>
<p>It does not appear to be possible&#151;or perhaps even appropriate&#151;to 
  combine the different reasons for concern into a unified reason for concern 
  that has meaning and is credible. However, we can review the relationship between 
  impacts and temperature over the 21st century for each reason for concern and 
  draw some preliminary conclusions about what change may be dangerous for each 
  reason for concern. Note that the following findings do not incorporate the 
  costs of limiting climate change to these levels. Also note that there is substantial 
  uncertainty regarding the temperatures mentioned below. These magnitudes of 
  change in global mean temperature should be taken as an approximate indicator 
  of when various categories of impacts might happen; they are not intended to 
  define absolute thresholds. </p>
<p>For simplification, we group different levels of global mean temperature increase 
  into "small," "medium," and "large." "Small" 
  denotes a global mean temperature increase of up to approximately 2&deg;C;<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn19.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  "medium" denotes a global mean temperature increase of approximately 
  2-3&deg;C; and "large" denotes a global mean temperature increase 
  of more than approximately 3&deg;C. In addition, changes in global mean temperature 
  do not describe all relevant aspects of climate-change impacts, such as rates 
  and patterns of change and changes in precipitation, extreme climate events, 
  or lagged (or latent) effects such as rising sea levels.</p>
<h4><a name="19821"></a>19.8.2.1. Unique and Threatened Systems</h4>
<p>Tropical glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, biodiversity "hot spots," 
  and ecotones are examples of unique and threatened entities that are confined 
  to narrow geographical ranges and are very sensitive to climate change. However, 
  their degradation or loss could affect regions outside their range. There is 
  medium confidence that many of these unique and threatened systems will be affected 
  by a small temperature increase. For example, coral reefs will bleach and glaciers 
  will recede; at higher magnitudes of temperature increase, other and more numerous 
  unique and threatened systems would become adversely affected. </p>
<h4><a name="19822"></a>19.8.2.2. Distributional Impacts</h4>
<p>The impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed among the peoples 
  of the world. There is high confidence that developing countries tend to be 
  more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries, and there is medium 
  confidence that climate change would exacerbate income inequalities between 
  and within countries. There also is medium confidence that a small temperature 
  increase would have net negative impacts on market sectors in many developing 
  countries and net positive impacts on market sectors in many developed countries. 
  However, there is high confidence that with medium to high increases in temperature, 
  net positive impacts would start to decline and eventually turn negative, and 
  negative impacts would be exacerbated. Estimates of distributional effects are 
  uncertain because of aggregation and comparison methods, assumptions about climate 
  variability, adaptation, levels of development, and other factors. In addition, 
  impacts are likely to vary between and within countries. Thus, not all developing 
  or developed countries will necessarily have benefits or damages in unison.</p>
<h4><a name="19823"></a>19.8.2.3. Aggregate Impacts</h4>
<table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tr> 
    <td class="figure"><a href="fig19-7.htm"><img src="images/fig19-7s.jpg" width="300" height="171" border="0"></a><br>
      <b>Figure 19-7:</b> Impacts of or risks from climate change, by reason for 
      concern. Each row corresponds to a reason for concern; shades correspond 
      to severity of impact or risk. White means no or virtually neutral impact 
      or risk, light gray means somewhat negative impacts or low risks, and dark 
      gray means more negative impacts or higher risks. Global average temperatures 
      in the 20th century increased by 0.6&deg;C and led to some impacts. Impacts 
      are plotted against increases in global mean temperature after 1990. This 
      figure addresses only how impacts or risks change as thresholds of increase 
      in global mean temperature are crossed, not how impacts or risks change 
      at different rates of change in climate. Temperatures should be taken as 
      approximate indications of impacts, not as absolute thresholds. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><a name="fig197"></a>With a small temperature increase, there is medium confidence 
  that aggregate market sector impacts would amount to plus or minus a few percent 
  of world GDP; there is low confidence that aggregate nonmarket impacts would 
  be negative. Some studies find a potential for small net positive market impacts 
  under a small to medium temperature increase. However, given the uncertainties 
  about aggregate estimates, the possibility of negative effects cannot be excluded. 
  In addition, most people in the world would be negatively affected by a small 
  to medium temperature increase. Most studies of aggregate impacts find that 
  there are net damages at the global scale beyond a medium temperature increase 
  and that damages increase from there with further temperature increases. The 
  important qualifications raised regarding distributional analysis also apply 
  to aggregate analysis. By its nature, aggregate analysis masks potentially serious 
  equity differences. Estimates of aggregate impacts are controversial because 
  they treat gains for some as cancelling out losses for others and because weights 
  that are used to aggregate over individuals are necessarily subjective.</p>
<h4><a name="19824"></a>19.8.2.4. Extreme Climate Effects</h4>
<p>The frequency and magnitude of many extreme climate events increase even with 
  a small temperature increase and will become greater at higher temperatures 
  (high confidence). Extreme events include, for example, floods, soil moisture 
  deficits, tropical and other storms, anomalous temperatures, and fires. The 
  impacts of extreme events often are large locally and could strongly affect 
  specific sectors and regions. Increases in extreme events can cause critical 
  design or natural thresholds to be exceeded, beyond which the magnitude of impacts 
  increases rapidly (high confidence).</p>
<h4><a name="19825"></a>19.8.2.5. Large-Scale Singularities</h4>
<p>Large-scale singularities in the response of the climate system to external 
  forcing, such as shutdown of the North Atlantic THC or collapse of the WAIS, 
  have occurred in the past as a result of complex forcings. Similar events in 
  the future could have substantial impacts on natural and socioeconomic systems, 
  but the implications have not been well studied. Determining the timing and 
  probability of occurrence of large-scale singularities is difficult because 
  these events are triggered by complex interactions between components of the 
  climate system. The actual impact could lag the climate change cause (involving 
  the magnitude and the rate of climate change) by decades to millenia. There 
  is low to medium confidence that rapid and large temperature increases would 
  exceed thresholds that would lead to large-scale singularities in the climate 
  system. </p>
<p><a href="#fig197">Figure 19-7</a> sums up the reasons for concern regarding 
  impacts relative to change in temperature. Each row corresponds to a reason 
  for concern, and the shades correspond to the severity of impact or risk. White 
  means no or virtually neutral impact or risk, light gray means somewhat negative 
  impacts or low risks, and dark gray means more negative impacts or higher risks. 
  The period 1850-1990 warmed by 0.6&deg;C and led to some impacts. Unique 
  and threatened systems were affected, and the magnitude and frequency of some 
  extreme events have changed. Future impacts are plotted against increases in 
  global mean temperature after 1990.</p>
<p>Adverse impacts are estimated to occur in three reasons for concern even at 
  a small increase in temperature: unique and threatened systems, extreme weather 
  events, and distributional impacts. For the other two reasons for concern&#151;adverse 
  impacts and large-scale discontinuities&#151;adverse impacts begin at the medium 
  level of temperature increase for the former and a large temperature increase 
  for the latter. </p>
