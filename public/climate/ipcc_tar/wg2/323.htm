<h2>8.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Our definition of the financial services sector includes private and public 
  institutions that offer insurance, disaster preparedness/ recovery, banking, 
  and asset management services. Analysis of the financial services sector provides 
  a unique opportunity to quantify the potential socioeconomic impacts of climate 
  change and offers a barometer of effects on other sectors (including the government 
  sector). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment 
  Report (TAR) highlights insurance and other components of the financial services 
  sector because they represent a risk-spreading mechanism through which the costs 
  of weather-related events are distributed among other sectors and throughout 
  society. The sector also is among the world's largest and is captured less 
  effectively in other parts of the TAR. The financial services sector also stands 
  to play a central part in adaptation and mitigation activities and is a major 
  source of global and regional data on the costs of weather-related events (Mills, 
  1996; Changnon <i>et al</i>., 2000; Kunreuther, 2000).</p>
<p>This chapter is about the impact of climate change on the financial services 
  sector, as well as the way this sector can adapt and help society to adapt to 
  climate change. Still, little can be said about the total financial cost of 
  adapting to climate change. Short-term effects are likely to be felt most through 
  changing frequencies and intensities of ordinary and catastrophic weather events.</p>
<p>The Second Assessment Report (SAR) chapter on financial services concluded 
  that "within financial services the property insurance industry is most likely 
  to be directly affected by climate change, since it is already vulnerable to 
  variability in extreme weather events" (Dlugolecki <i>et al</i>., 1996). Experience 
  and analyses over the past 5 years has confirmed the trend of growing weather-related 
  damage costs since the 1950s (see <a href="324.htm">Section 8.2</a>). </p>
<p>The vulnerability of and challenges for the insurance sector, private and public, 
  are addressed in <a href="327.htm">Section 8.3</a>. <a href="337.htm">Section 
  8.4</a> discusses the implications for other financial services, such as corporate, 
  retail, and investment banking. There is evidence that the banking and insurance 
  industries have become more aware of opportunities and threats with regard to 
  climate change since the SAR. However, little information is available on climate 
  change impact and adaptation implications for the banking sector.</p>
<p>Climate change impacts are expected to be greatest in the developing world. 
  There is only limited penetration of or access to insurance in these regions. 
  This situation makes these regions more vulnerable and will impair their ability 
  to adapt. Over the past few years, several multilateral organizations and banks 
  have taken initiatives to develop new financial schemes for coping with natural 
  disasters in developing countries (see <a href="340.htm">Section 8.5</a>).</p>
<p>Issues regarding funding for adaptation are addressed in <a href="344.htm">Section 
  8.6.</a> Although knowledge about the financial services sector, private and 
  public, generally has increased since the SAR, major questions remain. Research 
  could help explore the potential roles of the sector in helping society respond 
  to the challenge of climate change (see <a href="345.htm">Section 8.7</a>).</p>
