<h2>18.3. Future Adaptations</h2>
<p>Predictions or estimates of likely future adaptations are an essential element 
  of climate change impact and vulnerability assessment. The degree to which a 
  future climate change risk is dangerous depends greatly on the likelihood and 
  effectiveness of adaptations in that system. Studies that ignore or assume no 
  adaptation are likely to overestimate residual or net impacts and vulnerabilities, 
  whereas those that assume full and effective adaptation are likely to underestimate 
  residual impacts and vulnerabilities (Reilly, 1999; Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 
  1999; Risbey <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Hence, it is important 
  to have an improved understanding of the process of adaptation and better information 
  on the conditions under which adaptations of various types are expected to occur. 
  Such scholarship on the "how, when, and why" of adaptation is necessary 
  to make informed judgments on the vulnerabilities of sectors, regions, and communities 
  (Ausubel, 1991a; Kane <i>et al.</i>, 1992a; Reilly, 1995; Burton, 1997; Smithers 
  and Smit, 1997; Tol <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Klein <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Insights 
  into processes of adaptation have been gained from several types of analysis, 
  including listing of possible adaptation measures, impact assessment models, 
  adaptation process models, historical and spatial analogs, and empirical analysis 
  of contemporary adaptation processes.</p>
<a name="1831"></a> 
<h3>18.3.1. Possible Adaptation Measures</h3>
<p>There are many arbitrary lists of possible adaptation measures, initiatives, 
  or strategies that have a potential to moderate impacts, if they were implemented 
  (e.g., Benioff <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mimura, 1999b). 
  Such <i>possible</i> adaptations are based on experience, observation, and speculation 
  about alternatives that might be created (Carter, 1996); they cover a wide range 
  of types and take numerous forms (UNEP, 1998). For example, possible adaptive 
  measures for health risks associated with climate change listed by Patz (1996) 
  appear in <a href="#tab18-2">Table 18-2</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, in coastal zone studies, comprehensive lists of potential adaptation 
  measures are presented; these adaptations include a wide array of engineering 
  measures, improvements, or changes, including agricultural practices that are 
  more flood-resistant; negotiating regional water-sharing agreements; providing 
  efficient mechanisms for disaster management; developing desalination techniques; 
  planting mangrove belts to provide flood protection; planting salt-tolerant 
  varieties of vegetation; improving drainage facilities; establishing setback 
  policies for new developments; developing food insurance schemes; devising flood 
  early warning systems; and so forth (Al-Farouq and Huq, 1996; Jallow, 1996; 
  Rijsberman and van Velzen, 1996; Teves <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mimura and Harasawa, 
  2000). In many other sectors and regions, arbitrary lists of possible adaptations 
  are common (Erda, 1996; Iglesias <i>et al.</i>, 1996). In the Canadian agricultural 
  sector alone, 96 different adaptation measures have been identified, as summarized

<p>Such lists indicate the range of strategies and measures that represent possible 
  adaptations to climate change risks in particular sectors and regions. They 
  show that there is a large variety and number of possible adaptations, including 
  many with the potential to reduce adverse climatic change impacts. Many of these 
  adaptations&#151;especially in agriculture, water resources, and coastal zone 
  applications&#151;essentially represent improved resource management, and many 
  would have benefits in dealing with current climatic hazards as well as with 
  future climatic risks (El Shaer <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Harrington, 1996; Huang, 
  1996; Stakhiv, 1996; Frederick, 1997; Hartig <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Mendelsohn 
  and Bennett, 1997; Major, 1998). In only a few cases are such lists of possible 
  adaptations considered according to who might undertake them, under what conditions 
  might they be implemented, and how effective might they be (Easterling, 1996; 
  Harrington, 1996; Frederick, 1997; Major, 1998; Moss, 1998).</p>
<a name="1832"></a> 
<h3>18.3.2. Impact Assessment Models</h3>
<p>Estimates of likely future adaptations are essential parts of climate change 
  impact models. Integrated assessment models also include assumptions about adaptations 
  in the impact components (Leemans, 1992; Rotmans <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Dowlatabadi, 
  1995; Hulme and Raper, 1995; West and Dowlatabadi, 1999). Some early studies 
  of impacts assumed no adaptation (Tol <i>et al.</i>, 1998), invoking the so-called 
  "naive" or "dumb farmer" assumption. The "dumb farmer" 
  assumption&#151;which is not unique to agriculture&#151;is a metaphor for any 
  impacted agent that is assumed not to anticipate or respond to changed climate 
  conditions but continues to act as if nothing has changed (Rosenberg, 1992; 
  Easterling <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 1996). By ignoring autonomous and planned 
  adaptations, such studies do not distinguish between potential and residual 
  net impacts and are of limited utility in assessing vulnerability. </p>
<p>An alternative approach that is common in more recent impact modeling has been 
  to assume levels of adaptation. Applications include Nicholls and Leatherman 
  (1995) for coastal zones, Mendelsohn <i>et al.</i> (1994) and Rosenzweig and Parry 
  (1994) for agriculture, Sohngen and Mendelsohn (1998) for timber, and Rosenthal 
  <i>et al.</i> (1995) for space conditioning in buildings. These studies demonstrate 
  that adaptive measures have the potential to significantly alleviate adverse 
  impacts of climate change and to benefit from opportunities associated with 
  changed climatic conditions (Helms <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Schimmelpfennig, 1996; Mendelsohn 
  and Neumann, 1999). The models of Rosenzweig and Parry (1994) show that, with 
  adaptations assumed, food production could be increased under climate change 
  in many regions of the world. Stuczyinski <i>et al.</i> (2000) conclude that climate 
  change would reduce Polish agriculture production by 5-25% without adaptation; 
  with adaptation assumed, production is estimated to change by -5 to +5% 
  of current levels. Downing (1991) demonstrates the potential of adaptations 
  to reduce food deficits in Africa from 50 to 20%. Mendelsohn and Dinar (1999) 
  estimate that private adaptation could reduce potential climate damages in India's 
  agriculture from 25 to 15-23%. Reilly <i>et al.</i> (1994) estimate global "welfare" 
  losses in the agri-food sector of between US$0.1 billion and 61.2 billion without 
  adaptation, compared to +US$70 to -37 billion with adaptation assumed. 
  These studies indicate <i>potential</i> rather than the <i>likelihood</i> of 
  adaptation to alleviate damages (or benefit from opportunities) associated with 
  changes in climatic mean conditions (rather than changing conditions that include 
  variability and extremes of climate). </p>
<p>Impact models invariably are based on climate scenarios that focus on adaptation 
  to changed average conditions, with little attention given to interannual variations 
  and extremes. Limited research suggests that the potential of adaptation to 
  cope with changes in average conditions is greater than its potential to cope 
  with climate change-related variability. For example, Mendelsohn <i>et al.</i> (1999) 
  show that, assuming adaptation, increases in average temperature would be beneficial 
  for U.S. agriculture, but increases in interannual variation would be harmful. 
  West and Dowlatabadi (1999) demonstrate that considering variability and extremes 
  can lead to estimates of "optimal" adaptation and damages that differ 
  considerably from those based on gradual changes in mean climatic conditions. 
  The importance of considering variability, not just mean climate, when estimating 
  adaptation is widely recognized (Robock <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Mearns <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Alderwish 
  and Al-Eryani, 1999; Alexandrov, 1999; Luo and Lin, 1999; Murdiyarso, 2000). 
</p>
<p>In numerical impact models, assumptions about perception and adaptation are 
  more commonly arbitrary or based on principles of efficiency and rationality 
  and assume full information (Yohe <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Hurd <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Mendelsohn 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). As Tol <i>et al.</i> (1998), Schneider <i>et al.</i> (2000), and others have 
  noted, however, actual and assumed behavior do not necessarily match. In an 
  analysis of global food production, Parry <i>et al.</i> (1999) assume farm-level and 
  economic system adaptations but recognize that the "adoption of efficient 
  adaptation techniques is far from certain." In addition to questions relating 
  to rationality principles, adaptation behavior is known to vary according to 
  the amount and type of information available, as well as the ability to act. 
  Hence, rational behavior that is based on assumed perfect information differs 
  from rational behavior under uncertainty (Yohe <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Yohe and Neumann, 
  1997; West and Dowlatabadi, 1999). Replacing the "no adaptation" model 
  with one that assumes rational, unconstrained actors with full information replaces 
  the "dumb farmer" assumption with the "clairvoyant farmer" 
  assumption (Smit <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Risbey <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Reilly (1998) questions 
  the ability and hence the likelihood of agents to detect and respond efficiently 
  to the manifestations of climate change. Tol (1998b) also questions whether 
  perfect foresight and rational behavior are realistic assumptions for predictive 
  models. Schneider (1997) explores further the assumptions that underlie equilibrium 
  approaches (ergodic economics), including the equivalence of temporal and spatial 
  variations. </p>
<p>Numerical impact assessment models tend to <i>use</i>, rather than <i>generate</i>, 
  information on adaptations to estimate future impacts of climate stimuli, after 
  the effects of adaptation have been factored in. They indicate the potential 
  of human systems to adapt autonomously and thus to moderate climate change damages.
