<h2>9.13 Research and Information Needs, including Monitoring</h2>
<p>Research on the health impacts of global climate change should be conducted 
  within an international network of scientists. Climatic-environmental changes 
  will vary by geographic location, and local populations vary in their vulnerability 
  to such changes. Therefore, the patterns of health gains and losses will be 
  very context-dependent. This type of research requires maximum exchange of information 
  and cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques among scientists, agencies, 
  and institutes. In particular, forecasting the likely health outcomes of exposure 
  to future climate-environmental scenarios requires development of predictive 
  models that can integrate across disparate systems. This will require an interdisciplinary 
  approach. There is an urgent need to focus research efforts more sharply. Particular 
  tasks include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Epidemiological studies of ongoing climatic variability and trends in relation 
    to health</li>
  <li>Development of mathematical models to forecast likely health outcomes in 
    relation to projected climatic/ environmental changes, accounting for concurrent 
    social and economic circumstances and their projected changes</li>
  <li>Development of monitoring methods and systems to detect early evidence of 
    health-related changes and further inform epidemiological and predictive modeling 
    studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring of the potential impacts of climate change on health is important 
  for several reasons (Campbell-Lendrum <i>et al</i>., 2000; Kovats and Martens, 2000):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early detection of the health impacts of climate change</li>
  <li>Improved analysis of relationships between climate and health</li>
  <li>Validation of predictive models</li>
  <li>Increased understanding of vulnerability </li>
  <li>Assessment of effectiveness of adaptation strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epidemiological data are necessary to inform policymakers about the magnitude 
  of actual or potential impacts of climate change. Most current infection surveillance 
  systems have been designed to detect particular causes, such as food-borne disease, 
  and individual risk factors, such as overseas travel. Monitoring of climate 
  change requires a more comprehensive approach to infection etiology, examining 
  the possible influence of climate on the environmental sources of pathogens 
  and on human behavior (WHO-ECEH, 1998a,b). Another challenge for climate study 
  is the size of data sets required. Although trends in any one country will be 
  a starting point, improved coordination of infection data across regions will 
  be needed. Epidemiological data also would help to determine the requirements 
  for and the effectiveness of preventive actions.<br>
</p>
<p>Bioindicators of health risk also need to be developed, to detect early or 
  unanticipated health impacts of climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion. 
  For example, mapping and monitoring of vector species could be strengthened 
  to detect early changes in their distribution associated with climate change 
  (Campbell-Lendrum <i>et al</i>., 2000). The effect of extreme weather events such as 
  heat waves and floods need to be included in enhanced surveillance for assessment 
  of future impacts. <br>
</p>
<p>Populations vary in their vulnerability to health impacts and in the resources 
  available for adaptive responses (McMichael <i>et al</i>., 2000b). These differences 
  in vulnerability, between and within populations, reflect a wide range of demographic, 
  cultural, political, socioeconomic, and technological circumstances. In the 
  future, national impact assessments should describe and identify means by which 
  the vulnerability of populations and subgroups could be reduced and select priorities 
  for monitoring.</p>
