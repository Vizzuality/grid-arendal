<h4>5.6.3.2.2. Industrial timber </h4>
<p>Recent industrial timber studies link equilibrium ecological models to economic 
  models to measure market impacts to potential climate change and include adaptation 
  (Joyce et al., 1995; Perez-Garcia et al., 1997; Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 1998; 
  McCarl et al., 2000; Sohngen et al., 2000). Conclusions from regional studies 
  are similar to those in the SAR (Solomon et al., 1996) for temperate regions, 
  suggesting that wood supply in these regions will not be reduced by climate 
  change. Studies in the United States that consider only changes in forest growth 
  find small negative or positive impacts on timber supply (Joyce et al., 1995; 
  McCarl et al., 2000). Studies that consider growth effects and species redistribution 
  effects (dieback of existing forests, followed by redistribution), as well as 
  alternative economic scenarios, find that welfare economic impacts in U.S. timber 
  markets could change by -1 to +11% (Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 1998). Generally, 
  consumers are predicted to benefit from increased supply and lower prices. Producers 
  in some regions of the United States may lose because of lower prices and dieback, 
  although productivity gains could offset lower prices (Sohngen, 2001). </p>
<p>In contrast to the SAR (Solomon et al., 1996), more recent global market studies 
  suggest that climate change is likely to increase global timber supply and enhance 
  existing market trends toward rising market share in developing countries (Perez-Garcia 
  et al., 1997; Sohngen et al., 2000). One study that uses TEM (Melillo et al., 
  1993) to predict growth changes finds that global timber growth rises, global 
  timber supply increases, prices fall, and consumers and mill owners benefit 
  (Perez-Garcia et al., 1997). Landowners in regions where increased timber growth 
  does not offset lower prices perceive losses. A study using the BIOME3 model 
  (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996) suggests that producers in temperate and boreal 
  forests could be susceptible to economic losses from short-term dieback effects 
  and lower prices, although long-term (&gt;50 years) supply from these regions 
  is predicted to increase (Sohngen et al., 2000). Alternatively, studies that 
  do not consider global market forces, timber prices, or adaptation predict that 
  supply in boreal regions is likely to decline (Solomon and Leemans, 1997).</p>
<h4><a name="56323"></a>5.6.3.2.3. Recreation and non-wood forest products</h4>
<p>There is considerably less published literature available to assess the effects 
  of climate change on nonmarket services from forests (Wall, 1998), including 
  recreation and non-wood forest products. Climate change is likely to have direct 
  effects on forest-based recreation. For example, lengthening of the summer season 
  may increase forest recreation (Wall, 1998). Changes in the mean and variance 
  in daily temperature and precipitation during peak seasons will affect specific 
  activities differently, however. In the United States, some studies suggest 
  that higher temperatures may negatively affect camping, hiking, and skiing but 
  positively affect fishing (Loomis and Crespi, 1999; Mendelsohn and Markowski, 
  1999; Joyce et al., 2000). </p>
<p>Climate change also will have indirect effects on forest recreation. For example, 
  changes in the structure and function of natural forests that are used for recreation 
  could alter visitation patterns by causing users to substitute alternative sites. 
  Alternatively, some recreational industries may have large adaptation costs&#151;for 
  example, snow-making costs in skiing areas may increase (Irland et al., 2001). 
  In addition, institutional factors are likely to play a strong role in mediating 
  the response of recreation because much of it occurs on public, natural forests 
  where adaptation may be less economically feasible. Many forest-based activities, 
  such as hunting, rely on management decisions by agencies that will have to 
  adapt to climate change as well (Brotton and Wall, 1997).</p>
