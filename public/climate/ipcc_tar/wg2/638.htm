<h2>17.4. Synthesis</h2>
<h3><a name="1741"></a>17.4.1. Feedbacks, Interactions, and Resilience: The Relevance 
  of these Concepts to Small Islands</h3>
<p>Feedback mechanisms in changing systems are poorly understood. These mechanisms 
  could produce a series of <i>downstream effects</i> as conditions within a system 
  deviate from "normal" and can include mechanisms that bring conditions 
  back toward "normal" (correcting) or push conditions further away 
  from "normal" (compounding). Feedback of interactions between humans 
  and the environment in the face of climate change are likely to be negative 
  and are expected to increase. As humans have to take adaptive actions to preserve 
  their systems in the face of climate change and sea-level rise, there is a risk 
  that impacts on the environment will increase, despite better awareness of the 
  issues. The short-term needs of humans are likely to take precedence over longer-term 
  needs, which are intimately tied up with the environment. This could mean greater-than-expected 
  and unpredictable indirect impacts resulting from climate change and sea-level 
  rise.</p>
<p>Small island states urgently need sensible predictive information and tools 
  for minimizing the likely outcomes of climate change and sea-level rise because 
  it is now generally accepted that small islands are intrinsically more vulnerable 
  than larger countries (Briguglio, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997; Wells, 1996, 1997; 
  Atkins<i> et al.,</i> 1998; UNDP, 1998). The vulnerability of natural systems 
  is still under investigation, although work is underway (Yamada <i>et al.,</i> 
  1995; Sem <i>et al.,</i> 1996; Kaly <i>et al.,</i> 1999). This makes the requirement 
  for information and tools for generating such information a top priority. The 
  outcome of climate change on human and natural systems in small island states 
  will depend on changes induced by climate itself, feedback mechanisms, human 
  adaptive capacity, and the resilience of biophysical and human systems. </p>
<p>Indicators of high resilience might include the presence of healthy, intact 
  ecosystems; the ability of species to acclimatize to new temperature regimes; 
  the presence of land higher than the maximum predicted transgression plus storm 
  surges; high productivity; reproduction and recruitment of species; and high 
  rates of natural recovery (Kaly <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Resilience refers to the innate ability of biophysical and human systems to 
  maintain their integrity when subjected to disturbance (Holling, 1973; Ludwig 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). For most natural systems, knowledge of resilience to climate 
  change and sea-level rise is inadequate. For example, there are insufficient 
  data to describe the ability of a reef to withstand sea-level rise of 20-40 
  cm over the next 50 years (but see Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Predicting which ecological 
  variables (e.g., species, processes) might be affected and what effect this 
  would have on ecosystem diversity, function, and future resilience may be difficult 
  or impossible (Lubchenco <i>et al., </i>1993). Proxy estimates have been made, 
  most notably using recent El Ni&ntilde;o events in the eastern Pacific; these 
  estimates have many of the expected effects of climate change (Castilla <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1993; Burns, 2000). For oceans, these and other proxy estimates predict 
  the extinction of species, mass mortality and bleaching of corals, changes in 
  the geographic range of species, increases in disease, unexpected predation, 
  decreases in productivity, and increases in harmful algal blooms (Glynn, 1984, 
  1988, 1991; Bak <i>et al.</i>, 1984; Hallegraeff, 1993; Lessios, 1998; Hoegh-Guldberg, 
  1999).</p>
<p>Although earlier work suggested that systems exposed to perturbations tend 
  to have greater capacity to recover from shock (e.g., Holling, 1973), research 
  in a small island context challenges this conventional wisdom. Kaly <i>et al. 
  </i>(1999) demonstrate that for many systems, the greater the number and intensity 
  of hazards (human-induced as well as natural) that have impacted them in the 
  past, the greater is their level of vulnerability to future stresses. Furthermore, 
  because neither the natural resilience nor the altered resilience of any ecosystem 
  is known&#151;let alone the resilience that might arise as a result of summed 
  or interactive effects&#151;it is impossible to directly estimate overall resilience. 
  This finding is very disturbing for most small island states, where ecosystems 
  already are severely stressed from natural and anthropogenic forces.</p>
<h3>17.4.2. Uncertainties and Risks<a name="1742"></a></h3>
<h4>17.4.2.1. Inconsistencies and Limitations in Projected Changes<a name="17421"></a></h4>
<p>Present ability to accurately assess the effects of climate change in small 
  island states, as in other regions, is further impeded by conflicting predictions 
  of how natural systems may respond. For example, some studies cite the responses 
  of ecosystems to El Ni&ntilde;o events in the 1980s and 1990s as indicative 
  of the likely effects of climate change, with conflicting outcomes (Salinger, 
  1999; Gillespie and Burns, 2000; Hay, 2000). On one hand, it is expected that 
  primary productivity in oceans will <i>decrease</i> as a result of global warming 
  when upwelled waters become shoaled (Roemmich and McGowan, 1995; Barber <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1996). On the other hand, it has been predicted that harmful algal 
  blooms will <i>increase</i> with increasing temperatures (Colwell, 1996; Nurse 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998; see also Hales <i>et al.,</i> 1999b). Clearly, forecasting 
  of likely outcomes will be more complex than may have been expected initially. 
  Thus, planning of appropriate responses in regions of low adaptive capacity, 
  such as small island states, presents an even greater challenge.<br>
</p>
<h4>17.4.2.2. Ecosystem Collapse<a name="17422"></a></h4>
One of the likely outcomes of climate change and sea-level rise in natural systems 
is their collapse. Although ecosystem collapse is not presently well-defined or 
understood, it is a concern of island countries, which depend heavily on resources 
provided by these systems to sustain their economic and social well-being (Burns, 
2000; Gillespie and Burns, 2000). If mangrove systems are to migrate inland, for 
example, what is involved is the collapse of the original mangrove system on the 
existing shore and its eventual replacement with another ecosystem. It is unclear 
whether the old mangrove area would be replaced by a viable alternative marine 
ecosystem or whether the new mangroves produced inland would be a viable ecosystem, 
with all of the same functional characteristics of the original. These and similar 
questions are central to understanding the ability of human and natural systems 
to adapt to climate change and sea-level rise.<br>
