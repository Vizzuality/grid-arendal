<h4>5.3.4.5. Adaptation Effects on Farm and Regional Land Use and Income</h4>
<p>Reilly <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1996) review several studies that analyzed the effects 
  of climate scenarios at the farm scale. One important implication of these studies 
  is that changes in production activities and management adaptations could play 
  an important role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. <br>
</p>
<p>Survey-based studies on farm-level decisionmaking in response to climate change 
  have propagated since the SAR. Case studies in Canada suggest several farm-level 
  adaptive strategies to which farmers may resort (Brklacich <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997; 
  Smithers and Smit, 1997; Chiotti, 1998). In southern Ontario, Smit <i><i>et al</i></i>. 
  (1997) found that farmers' choice of cultivar to plant in the current year 
  is highly conditioned by the climate experienced the year before. There have 
  been few quantitative, farm-level economic studies of response and adaptation 
  to climate change since the SAR. In the U.S. midwest, Doering <i><i>et al</i></i>. 
  (1997) used a crop-livestock linear programming model linked to the Century 
  biogeochemistry model to investigate the impacts of climate change on 11 representative 
  farms in the region under a doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> scenario. The analysis considered 
  these farms under static technology and adapted technology; thus, the analysis 
  could be regarded as representing farm-level economic responses to climate change 
  as well as farm-level combined technological and economic adaptation. It showed 
  that climate change may cause substantial shifts in the mix of crops grown in 
  the upper midwest, with much less land planted to a corn-soybean rotation and 
  more land devoted to wheat than now. Earlier planting of corn increased returns; 
  hence, a more frost-resistant corn variety was found to be important to farm-level 
  adaptation. Using a similar methodology, Parry <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1996) predict 
  optimal agricultural land use in response to climate change in England and Wales. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Antle <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999b) used an econometric-process simulation model of 
  the dryland grain production system in Montana linked to the Century model (as 
  reported in Paustian <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999) to assess the economic impacts of 
  climate change in that region. Unlike other farm-level studies, this analysis 
  is based on a statistically representative sample of commercial grain farms 
  in the region, not on a small number of representative farms, so the results 
  can be interpreted as representing the entire population of farms in the study 
  area. Moreover, instead of using linear programming models, this analysis combines 
  site-specific data and econometric production models in a stochastic simulation 
  model, allowing representation of physical and economic heterogeneity in the 
  region. Simulations were conducted for baseline and doubled CO<sub>2</sub> (Canadian 
  Climate model) with observed production technology, with and without land-use 
  adaptation and with and without CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization. With climate change, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, and adaptation, mean returns change by -11 
  to + 6% relative to the base climate and variability in returns increases by 
  +7 to +25%, whereas without adaptation mean returns change by -8 to -31% 
  and variability increases by +25 to 83%. These findings provide support for 
  the hypothesis that ability to adapt plays a critical role not only in mean 
  impacts but also in the spatial variability of impacts. They provide empirical 
  support to the hypothesis advanced in the SAR that climate change is likely 
  to have its greatest adverse impacts on areas where resource endowments are 
  poorest and the ability of farmers to respond and adapt is most limited.</p>
<h4><a name="5346"></a>5.3.4.6. Environmental and Natural Resource Consequences 
  of Responses and Adaptation to Climate Change</h4>
<p>None of the economic studies in Reilly <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1996) analyze the environmental 
  consequences of adaptation to climate change, such as increased demands on land 
  and water resources. Adams <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1998) observe that this shortcoming 
  remains true of most recent studies. However, Darwin <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1995) do 
  include an analysis of impacts of climate change on land and water resources 
  in a global model with the world subdivided into eight regions. They argue that 
  competition from crop production could aggravate direct climate-induced losses 
  of forests in moist tropical regions. IMAGE 2.0 simulations with future scenarios 
  of limited CO<sub>2</sub> emissions show that increased deforestation increases 
  agricultural capacity because of a smaller CO<sub>2</sub> fertilizaton effect 
  on crops than if emissions continue on the current trajectory (Leemans, 1997).<br>
</p>
<p> Lewandrowski and Schimmelpfinnig (1999) draw implications for impacts on land 
  and water resources, wild species, and natural ecosystems from the literature. 
  They suggest that increased demand for irrigation predicted by these studies 
  is likely to increase the opportunity cost of water and possibly reduce water 
  availability for wildlife and natural ecosystems. However, it is difficult to 
  go beyond such generalities with these aggregate models because most environmental 
  impacts of agriculture are site-specific. Strzepek <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) show 
  that some scenarios of climate change may reduce irrigation system reliability 
  in the lower Missouri River in the U.S. corn belt, which may induce instream 
  environmental stress. In many developing countries, current irrigation efficiencies 
  are very low by developed-country standards. Irrigation effeciency in the Philippines 
  in 1990 was 18%, compared to the global average of 43% (Asian Development Bank, 
  1998). Currently, 3,480-5,000 liters of water are used to produce 1.0 kg 
  rough rice (equivalent to 640 g milled rice) in the Philippines (Baradas, 1999) 
  and some neighboring countries. At those irrigation efficiencies, increased 
  irrigation demand caused by climate change would strain irrigation supplies. 
  Hence, one adaptation strategy is to increase irrigation efficiency.<br>
</p>
<p>Agriculture is a source and a sink of GHGs; hence, climate-induced agricultural 
  land-use change is likely to impact soil carbon stocks in agricultural soils 
  (Paustian <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996; Lal <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998; IPCC, 2000). Antle <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999b) and Paustian <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) link a field-scale econometric-process 
  simulation model to the Century ecosystem model to assess the impacts of climate 
  change (from the Canadian Climate Centre model) on soil carbon in the dryland 
  grain production system of the U.S. northern Great Plains. In a related set 
  of studies, Antle <i><i>et al</i></i>. (2000) and Paustian <i><i>et al</i></i>. (2000) link 
  a regional economic agricultural land-use model to the Century ecosystem model 
  to assess the impacts of climate change on soil carbon in central U.S. cropland. 
  These studies demonstrate that adaptive changes in land use and management are 
  likely to have greater impacts on soil carbon than the direct effects of climate. 
  Thus, adverse effects of climate change on soil carbon tend to be offset by 
  the adaptive changes in land use that would be made by farmers in response to 
  climate change. The degree of this offset depends on the magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  fertilization effects on crop yields. </p>
<h4><a name="5347"></a>5.3.4.7. Note on Costs of Adaptation</h4>
<p>Adaptation is unlikely to come without cost. In a literature survey, Tol <i>et 
  al</i>. (1998) conclude that adaptation costs (as opposed to net costs of damages) 
  are not reported in most impact studies, especially in agriculture. Yet transition 
  costs (e.g., to retrain farmers in new practices) and equilibrium costs (e.g., 
  to develop additional irrigation or apply more fertilizer) may be considerable. 
  The absence of a benefit-cost calculus for agricultural adaptation is a key 
  deficiency. Existing studies also fail to account for the process of long-term, 
  endogenous adaptation of technology in ways that are consistent with the extensive 
  economic literature on that subject (Antle, 1996b). This process also will involve 
  significant costs. An extensive body of economic research has studied the benefits 
  and costs of agricultural research and has shown that institutions that are 
  responsible for agricultural research adapt agricultural technology across space 
  and time in response to relative resource scarcity (Hayami and Ruttan, 1985). 
  Quiggin and Horowitz (1999) argue that changes in fixed capital for on-farm 
  and off-farm infrastructure may be the most significant cost associated with 
  adaptation to climate change.</p>
