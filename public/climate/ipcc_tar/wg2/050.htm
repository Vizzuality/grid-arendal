<h2><a name="71"></a>7.1. Detection of Climate Change Impacts</h2>
<p>Observational evidence indicates that climate changes in the 20th century already 
  have affected a diverse set of physical and biological systems. Examples of 
  observed changes with linkages to climate include shrinkage of glaciers; thawing 
  of permafrost; shifts in ice freeze and break-up dates on rivers and lakes; 
  increases in rainfall and rainfall intensity in most mid- and high latitudes 
  of the Northern Hemisphere; lengthening of growing seasons; and earlier flowering 
  dates of trees, emergence of insects, and egg-laying in birds. Statistically 
  significant associations between changes in regional climate and observed changes 
  in physical and biological systems have been documented in freshwater, terrestrial, 
  and marine environments on all continents. [<a href="663.htm">19.2</a>]</p>
<p>The presence of multiple causal factors (e.g., land-use change, pollution) 
  makes attribution of many observed impacts to regional climate change a complex 
  challenge. Nevertheless, studies of systems subjected to significant regional 
  climate change&#151;and with known sensitivities to that change&#151;find changes 
  that are consistent with well-established relationships between climate and 
  physical or biological processes (e.g., shifts in the energy balance of glaciers, 
  shifts in the ranges of animals and plants when temperatures exceed physiological 
  thresholds) in about 80% of biological cases and about 99% of physical cases. 
  <a href="#tabts16">Table TS-16</a> shows ~450 changes in processes or species 
  that have been associated with regional temperature changes. <a href="#figts11">Figure 
  TS-11</a> illustrates locations at which studies have documented regional temperature 
  change impacts. These consistencies enhance our confidence in the associations 
  between changes in regional climate and observed changes in physical and biological 
  systems. Based on observed changes, there is high confidence that 20th century 
  climate changes have had a discernible impact on many physical and biological 
  systems. Changes in biota and physical systems observed in the 20th century 
  indicate that these systems are sensitive to climatic changes that are small 
  relative to changes that have been projected for the 21st century. High sensitivity 
  of biological systems to long-term climatic change also is demonstrated by paleorecords. 
  [<a href="664.htm">19.2.2</a>.]</p>
<p>Signals of regional climate change impacts are expected to be clearer in physical 
  and biotic systems than in social and economic systems, which are simultaneously 
  undergoing many complex non-climate-related stresses, such as population growth 
  and urbanization. Preliminary indications suggest that some social and economic 
  systems have been affected in part by 20th century regional climate changes 
  (e.g., increased damages by floods and droughts in some locations, with apparent 
  increases in insurance impacts). Coincident or alternative explanations for 
  such observed regional impacts result in only low to medium confidence about 
  determining whether climate change is affecting these systems. [<a href="665.htm#19224">19.2.2.4</a>]</p>

<p><a name="figts12"></a>Some of the current knowledge about climate change impacts, 
  vulnerability, and adaptation is synthesized here along five reasons for concern: 
  unique and threatened systems, global aggregate impacts, distribution of impacts, 
  extreme weather events, and large-scale singular events. Consideration of these 
  reasons for concern contribute to understanding of vulnerabilities and potential 
  benefits associated with human-induced climate change that can aid deliberations 
  by policymakers of what could constitute dangerous interference with the climate 
  system in the context of Article 2 of the UNFCCC. No single dimension is paramount.</p>
<p><a href="#figts12">Figure TS-12</a> presents qualitative findings about climate 
  change impacts related to the reasons for concern. At a small increase in global 
  mean temperature,<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  some of the reasons for concern show the potential for negative impacts, whereas 
  others show little adverse impact or risk. At higher temperature increases, 
  all lines of evidence show a potential for adverse impacts, with impacts in 
  each reason for concern becoming more negative at increasing temperatures. There 
  is high confidence in this general relationship between impacts and temperature 
  change, but confidence generally is low in estimates of temperature change thresholds 
  at which different categories of impacts would happen. [<a href="685.htm">19.8</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="721"></a>7.2.1. Unique and Threatened Systems </h3>
<p>Small increases in global average temperature may cause significant and irreversible 
  damage to some systems and species, including possible local, regional, or global 
  loss. Some plant and animal species, natural systems, and human settlements 
  are highly sensitive to climate and are likely to be adversely affected by climate 
  changes associated with scenarios of &lt;1&deg;C mean global warming. Adverse 
  impacts to species and systems would become more numerous and more serious for 
  climatic changes that would accompany a global mean warming of 1-2&deg;C and 
  are highly likely to become even more numerous and serious at higher temperatures. 
  The greater the rate and magnitude of temperature and other climatic changes, 
  the greater the likelihood that critical thresholds of systems would be surpassed. 
  Many of these threatened systems are at risk from climate change because they 
  face nonclimate pressures such as those related to human land use, land-use 
  change, and pollution. [<a href="667.htm">19.3</a>]</p>
<p>Species that may be threatened with local or global extinction by changes in 
  climate that may accompany a small mean global temperature increase include 
  critically endangered species generally, species with small ranges and low population 
  densities, species with restricted habitat requirements, and species for which 
  suitable habitat is patchy in distribution, particularly if under pressure from 
  human land-use and land-cover change. Examples of species that may be threatened 
  by small changes include forest birds in Tanzania, the Resplendent Quetzal in 
  Central America, the mountain gorilla in Africa, amphibians that are endemic 
  to cloud forests of the neotropics, the spectacled bear of the Andes, the Bengal 
  tiger and other species that are endemic to the Sundarban wetlands, and rainfall-sensitive 
  plant species that are endemic to the Cape Floral Kingdom of South Africa. Natural 
  systems that may be threatened include coral reefs, mangroves, and other coastal 
  wetlands; montane ecosystems that are restricted to the upper 200-300 m of mountainous 
  areas; prairie wetlands; remnant native grasslands; coldwater and some coolwater 
  fish habitat; ecosystems overlying permafrost; and ice edge ecosystems that 
  provide habitat for polar bears and penguins. Human settlements that may be 
  placed at serious risk by changes in climate and sea level that may be associated 
  with medium to large mean warming include some settlements of low-lying coastal 
  areas and islands, floodplains, and hillsides&#151;particularly those of low 
  socioeconomic status such as squatter and other informal settlements. Other 
  potentially threatened settlements include traditional peoples that are highly 
  dependent on natural resources that are sensitive to climate change. [<a href="667.htm">19.3</a>]</p>
