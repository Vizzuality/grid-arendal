<h2>2.4. Integrated Assessment</h2>
<p>Policymakers require a coherent synthesis of all aspects of climate change. 
  Researchers have spent the past decade developing integrated assessment methods 
  to meet these needs of policymakers. An overview of the framework, including 
  examination of impact and vulnerability, is in the SAR (Weyant <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). In addition, Rotmans and Dowlatabadi (1998) have concentrated on the 
  broader social science components of integrated assessment; as a result, they 
  came closer to presenting a view within which impacts and adaptation might be 
  most fully investigated with and without relying on models. They assert, "Integrated 
  assessment is an interdisciplinary process of combining, interpreting, and communicating 
  knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines in such a way that the whole set 
  of cause-effect interactions of a problem can be evaluated." Current integrated 
  assessment efforts generally adopt one or more of four distinct methodological 
  approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Computer-aided modeling in which interrelationships and feedbacks are mathematically 
    represented, sometimes with uncertainties incorporated explicitly (see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 
    19</a>)</li>
  <li>Scenario analyses that work within representations of how the future might 
    unfold [the MINK study, based on a climate analog of the dust bowl climate 
    of the 1930s, is a classic example (see Rosenberg, 1993, for details)]</li>
  <li>Simulation gaming and participatory integrated assessment, including policy 
    (see Parson and Ward, 1998, for a careful review)</li>
  <li>Qualitative assessments that are based on limited and heterogeneous data 
    and built from existing experience and expertise. Cebon <i>et al</i>. (1998) 
    contains a collection of papers that offer similar qualitative coverage; their 
    insights can serve as the basis for a long-run research agenda that looks 
    for regions and sectors in which uncertain futures most significantly cloud 
    our view of where and when impacts might be most severe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schneider (1997) has developed a taxonomy of integrated assessments that creates 
  an historically rooted taxonomy of modeling approaches. It begins with "premethodogical 
  assessments" that worked with deterministic climate change, with direct 
  causal links and without feedbacks. It ends with "fifth-generation" 
  assessments that try to include changing values explicitly. In between are three 
  other stages of development, differentiated in large measure by the degree to 
  which they integrate disaggregated climate impacts, subjective human responses, 
  and endogenous policy and institutional evolution.</p>
<p>Methodological bias is an issue in interpreting the results of integrated assessments, 
  as it is in every research endeavor. Schneider (1997) also warns that models 
  composed of many submodules adopted from a wide range of disciplines are particularly 
  vulnerable to misinterpretation and misrepresentation. He underscores the need 
  for validation protocols and explorations of predictability limits. At the very 
  least, integrated assessments must record their underlying value-laden assumptions 
  as transparently as possible. Including decisionmakers and other citizens early 
  in the development of an assessment project can play an essential role in analytical 
  processes designed to produce quality science and facilitate appropriate incorporation 
  of their results into downstream decisions. </p>
<p>In the past decade, several research teams have been working on the development 
  of such frameworks (see Tol and Fankhauser, 1998, for a compendium of current 
  approaches). Known as integrated assessment models (IAMs), these frameworks 
  have been used to evaluate a variety of issues related to climate policy. Although 
  the current generation of IAMs vary greatly, in scope and in level of detail, 
  they all attempt to incorporate key human and natural processes required for 
  climate change policy analysis. More specifically, a full-scale IAM includes 
  submodels for simulating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activities that give rise to GHG emissions</li>
  <li>The carbon cycle and other processes that determine atmospheric GHG concentrations</li>
  <li>Climate system responses to changes in atmospheric GHG concentrations</li>
  <li>Environmental and economic system responses to changes in key climate-related 
    variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although IAMs provide an alternative approach to impact assessment, it is important 
  to note that there is no competition between such integrated approaches and 
  the more detailed sectoral and country case studies discussed in preceding sections. 
  Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses and its comparative advantage 
  in answering certain types of questions. In addition, there are considerable 
  synergies between the two types of studies. Integrated approaches depend on 
  more disaggregated efforts for specification and estimation of aggregate functions 
  and, as such, can be only as good as the disaggregated efforts. Reduced-form 
  integrated approaches make it relatively easy to change assumptions on the "causal 
  chain." That is, one can identify critical assumptions upon which a policy 
  analysis might turn.</p>
<p>In conducting such sensitivity analyses, one can identify where the value of 
  information is highest and where additional research may have the highest payoff 
  from a policy perspective. This can provide some useful guidance to the impacts 
  community about where to direct their efforts to resolve uncertainty. At the 
  same time, integrated models become more useful as uncertainty is narrowed (through 
  the contributions of partial impact assessments); hence, the reduced-form representations 
  become more realistic</p>
