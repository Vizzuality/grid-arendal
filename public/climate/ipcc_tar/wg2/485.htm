<p>A large fraction of the region is composed of unmodified or nonintensively 
  managed ecosystems where adaptation will depend mostly on natural processes. 
  Vulnerability will occur when the magnitude or rate of climate variations lies 
  outside the range of past variations. In some cases, adaptation processes may 
  be very accommodating, whereas in others adaptation may be very limited. Ecosystems 
  in the region handle a wide variety of climatic variability, in some cases with 
  very large swings, but generally this variation occurs on short time scales&#151;up 
  to a few years. This does not necessarily confer adaptability to long-term changes 
  of similar magnitude. </p>
<p>An important vulnerability identified by Basher <i>et al.</i> (1998) is the 
  problem of temperatures in low to mid-latitudes that reach levels never before 
  experienced and exceed the available tolerances of plants and animals, with 
  no options for migration. The southwest of western Australia is a case in point 
  (see <a href="471.htm#1242">Section 12.4.2</a>). Another potential vulnerability 
  arises from changes in the frequency of events. Examples include a climatic 
  swing of duration exceeding a reproductive requirement (e.g., water birds in 
  ephemeral lakes&#151;Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i>, 1998) and damaging 
  events occurring too frequently to allow young organisms to mature and ecosystems 
  to become reestablished.</p>
<p>Vulnerability also is expected to exist where species or ecosystems already 
  are stressed or marginal, such as with threatened species; remnant vegetation; 
  significantly modified systems; ecosystems already invaded by exotic organisms; 
  and areas where physical characteristics set constraints, such as atolls, low-lying 
  islands, and mountain tops. Coral reefs, for instance, may be able to survive 
  short periods of rising sea level in clear water but are less likely to do so 
  in turbid or polluted water or if their growth rates are reduced by acidification 
  of the ocean (Pittock, 1999). Vulnerability of coastal freshwater wetlands in 
  northern Australia to salinization resulting from increasing sea level and the 
  inability of some of these wetlands to migrate upstream because of physical 
  barriers in the landscape is described in <a href="472.htm#1245">Sections 12.4.5</a> 
  and <a href="473.htm#1247">12.4.7</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is relatively little specific information about the long-term 
  capacity for and rates of adaptation of ecosystems in Australia and New Zealand 
  that can be used to predict likely outcomes for the region. Therefore, a large 
  degree of uncertainty inevitably exists about the future of the region's 
  natural ecosystems under climate change. </p>
<a name="1284"></a> 
<h3>12.8.4. Managed Systems</h3>
<p>In the region's agriculture, many farming systems respond rapidly to external 
  changes in markets and technology, through changes in cultivars, crops, or farm 
  systems. Mid-latitude regions with adequate water supplies have many options 
  available for adaptation to climate change, in terms of crop types and animal 
  production systems drawn from other climatic zones. However, at low latitudes, 
  where temperatures increasingly will lie outside past bounds, there will be 
  no pool of new plant or animal options to draw from, and the productivity of 
  available systems is likely to decline.</p>
<p>Adaptation options will be more limited where a climatic element is marginal, 
  such as low rainfall, or where physical circumstances dictate, such as restricted 
  soil types. Even where adaptations are possible, they may be feasible only in 
  response to short-term or small variations. At some point, a need may arise 
  for major and costly reconfiguration, such as a shift from or to irrigation 
  or in farming activity. Indeed, one adaptation process already being implemented 
  in Australia to cope with existing competition for water is water pricing and 
  trading, which is likely to lead to considerable restructuring of rural industries 
  (see <a href="472.htm#1246">Section 12.4.6</a>).</p>
<p>Management of climate variability in Australia currently involves government 
  subsidies in the form of drought or flood relief when a specific level of extreme 
  that is classified as exceptional occurs (Stafford Smith and McKeon, 1998; see 
  also <a href="477.htm#1256">Section 12.5.6</a>). An adaptive measure being applied 
  in Australia and New Zealand is to improve seasonal forecasting and to help 
  farmers optimize their management strategies (Stone and McKeon, 1992; Stone 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996a; White, 2000), including reducing farm inputs in potentially 
  poor years.</p>
<p>However, if a trend toward more frequent extremes were to occur, such measures 
  might not allow farmers to make viable long-term incomes because there may be 
  fewer good years. The question arises whether this is merely a string of coincidental 
  extremes, for which assistance is appropriate, or whether it is part of an ongoing 
  trend resulting from climate change. The alternative policy response to the 
  latter possibility may well be to contribute to restructuring of the industry.</p>
<p>The PMSEIC (1999) report notes that there are opportunities for new sustainable 
  production systems that simultaneously contribute to mitigation objectives through 
  retention of vegetation and introduction of deeper rooted perennial pasture. 
  Tree farming in the context of a carbon-trading scheme would provide additional 
  opportunities, and this strategy could be linked to sustainability and alleviation 
  of dryland salinity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the report recognizes that totally new production systems may 
  be required for sustainability. These systems will need to capture water and 
  nutrients that otherwise would pass the root zone and cause degradation problems. 
  The design of such systems will entail research into rotating and mixing configurations 
  of plants; manipulating phenology; modifying current crops and pastures through 
  plant breeding, including molecular genetics; and possibly commercializing wildlife 
  species and endemic biological resources. The report concedes, however, that 
  there probably still will be agricultural areas where attempts to restore environmental 
  and economic health will meet with little success.</p>
<p>Vulnerability and the potential for adaptation can be investigated quantitatively 
  if a system and the climate change impacts on that system can be modeled. This 
  was done by Pittock and Jones (2000) and Jones (2000) for climatically induced 
  changes in irrigation water demand on a farm in northern Victoria. Here a window 
  of opportunity is opened for adaptation via identification of a future time 
  when adaptation would be necessary to reduce the risk of demand exceeding irrigation 
  supply.</p>
<p>Jones (2000) used a model that was based on historical irrigation practice. 
  Seasonal water use was used to estimate an annual farm cap of 12 Ml ha<sup>-1</sup>, 
  based on the annual allocated water right. Water demand in excess of this farm 
  cap in 50% of the years was taken to represent a critical threshold beyond which 
  the farmer cannot adapt. Conditional probabilities within projected ranges of 
  regional rainfall and temperature change were utilized, combined with a sensitivity 
  analysis, to construct risk response surfaces (see <a href="#fig12-5">Figure 
  12-5</a>). Monte Carlo sampling was used to calculate the probability of the 
  annual farm cap being exceeded across ranges of temperature and rainfall change 
  projected at intervals from 2000 to 2100. Some degree of adaptation was indicated 
  as desirable by 2030, although the theoretical critical threshold was not approached 
  until 2050, becoming probable by 2090 (see <a href="#fig12-6">Figure 12-6</a>). 
</p>
In a full analysis, this example would need to be combined with an analysis of 
the likelihood of changes in water supply (e.g., Schreider <i>et al.</i>, 1997) 
affecting the allocated irrigation cap and an evaluation of possible adaptation 
measures.<br clear="all">
