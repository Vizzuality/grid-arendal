<h2>6.3 Marine Ecosystems</h2>
<a name="631"></a><h3>6.3.1. Habitat</h3>
<p>The oceans have significant adaptive capacity to store heat and are the largest 
  reservoir of water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>, although the storage capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> in the 
  Southern Ocean recently has been questioned (Caldeira and Duffy, 2000). In the 
  oceans, climate change will induce temperature changes and associated adjustments 
  in ocean circulation, ice coverage, and sea level. Changes in the frequency 
  of extreme events also may be expected. These changes, in turn, will affect 
  marine ecosystem structure and functioning, with feedback to global biogeochemical 
  cycles and the climate system.</p>
<p>Recent investigations have shown that there has been a general warming of a 
  large part of the world ocean during the past 50 years (Levitus <i>et al.</i>, 2000). 
  Analysis of historical SST data by Cane <i>et al.</i> (1997) shows an overall increase 
  associated with land-based global temperature trends. Regional differences exist 
  such that over the past century a cooling was observed in the eastern equatorial 
  Pacific, combined with a strengthening of the zonal SST gradient. </p>
<p>Global mean sea-level has risen by about 0.1-0.2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over the past 
  3,000 years and by 1-2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> since 1900, with a central value of 1.5 
  mm yr<sup>-1</sup>. TAR WGI Chapter 11 projects that for the full range of the six illustrative 
  scenarios in the IPCC's Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, sea level 
  will rise by 0.09-0.88 m between 1990 and 2100. This range is similar to 
  the total range of projections given in the SAR of 0.13-0.94 m. Higher 
  mean sea level will increase the frequency of existing extreme levels associated 
  with storm waves and surges.</p>
<p>The El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation is a natural part of the Earth's 
  climate. A major issue is whether the intensity or frequency of ENSO events 
  might change as a result of global warming. Timmermann <i>et al.</i> (1999) suggested 
  an increased frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions under future greenhouse 
  warming and stronger "cold events" in the tropical Pacific Ocean. 
  Cooling has been observed in the eastern equatorial Pacific, not reproduced 
  in most GCMs, and has been explained by an increase in upwelling from the strengthening 
  of trade winds because of a uniform warming of the atmosphere (Cane <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997). If temperature differences between the tropics and polar regions are 
  reduced, however, a weakening of the atmospheric circulation patterns that cause 
  upwelling could be expected.</p>
<p>In recent years there have been several studies of global ocean wind and wave 
  climates (e.g., Young, 1999), but analyses of changes over the past few decades 
  have been limited to a few regions. In the past 30 years there has been an increase 
  in wave height over the whole of the North Atlantic, although scientists are 
  not certain that global change is the cause of this phenomenon (Guley and Hasse, 
  1999). Similarly, analyses of wave buoy data along the entire west coast of 
  North America demonstrate that the heights of storm-generated waves have increased 
  significantly during the past 3 decades (Komar <i>et al.</i>, 2000). On the U.S. east 
  coast, analyses have shown that there has been no discernible long-term trend 
  in the number and intensity of coastal storms during the past century, although 
  there has been considerable interdecadal variation (Zhang <i>et al.</i>, 2000). The 
  sensitivity of storm waves to a hypothetical sea-level rise and increase in 
  wind strength recently has been modeled for Uruguay (Lorenzo and Teixeira, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Projected changes in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity remain inconclusive, 
  although some studies have suggested that the maximum intensity of tropical 
  cyclones may rise by 10-20% (Henderson-Sellars <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Knutson <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Walsh and Pittock (1998) and Walsh and Katzfey (2000) also suggest 
  that once formed, tropical cyclone-like vortices might travel to higher latitudes 
  and persist for longer as a result of increased SST. </p>
<p>Increased precipitation intensity in extreme events is suggested by climate 
  models under doubled CO<sub>2</sub> for Europe (Jones <i>et al.</i>, 1997) and the United States 
  (Mearns <i>et al.</i>, 1995), and there is firm evidence that moisture in the atmosphere 
  is increasing over China, the Caribbean region, and the western Pacific (Trenberth, 
  1999). Heavy rainfall increased during the 20th century in the United States 
  (Karl and Knight, 1998), and there is evidence for increased precipitation rates 
  in Japan and Australia (Iwashima and Yamamoto, 1993; Suppiah and Hennessy, 1998). 
  Changes in the probability of heavy precipitation also are regarded as important 
  indicators of climate change.</p>
<p>Globally, oceanic thermohaline circulation plays an important role in controlling 
  the distribution of heat and greenhouse gases. This circulation is driven by 
  differences in seawater temperature and salinity. There is some evidence that 
  the global thermohaline circulation will weaken as a result of climate change, 
  although views on this issue are still evolving.</p>
<p>Sea ice covers about 11% of the ocean, depending on the season. It affects 
  albedo, salinity, and ocean-atmosphere thermal exchange. The latter determines 
  the intensity of convection in the ocean and, consequently, the mean time scale 
  of deep-ocean processes affecting CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and storage. Projected changes 
  in climate should produce large reductions in the extent, thickness, and duration 
  of sea ice. Major areas that are now ice-bound throughout the year are likely 
  to have lengthy periods during which waters are open and navigable. Observations 
  in the northern hemisphere already have shown a significant decrease in spring 
  and summer sea-ice extent by about 10-15% since the 1950s. It also has 
  been suggested that the decline in ice volume is underestimated because of significant 
  thinning of sea ice in the Arctic (Rothrock <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Evidence from whaling 
  records implies a decline in Antarctic ice extent by as much as 25% between 
  the mid-1950s and the early 1970s (de la Mare, 1997).</p>
<p>The foregoing physical responses in the ocean-climate system have implications 
  for habitat and ecology in the oceans and coastal seas. Projected climate changes 
  have the potential to become a major factor affecting marine living resources 
  over the next few decades. The degree of the impact is likely to vary within 
  a wide range, depending on the species and community characteristics and the 
  regional specific conditions. Smith <i>et al.</i> (1999) review the sensitivity of 
  marine ecosystems to climate change. </p>
