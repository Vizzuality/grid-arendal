<h3>2.2.2. Interpretation of Causation from Correlative Data</h3>
<h4><a name="2221"></a>2.2.2.1. Lines of Evidence</h4>
<p>Attribution of observed changes in natural systems to the effects of climate 
  change is analogous to attribution of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
  as causal factors of recent climate trends. Within the climate realm, the lines 
  of evidence are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Knowledge of fundamental processes of atmospheric forcing by different 
    gases and radiative features</li>
  <li> Geological evidence that shows changes in particular atmospheric gases 
    associated with changes in global climate</li>
  <li> General circulation models (GCMs) that accurately "predict" climatic 
    trends of the 20th century, based on fundamental principles of atmospheric 
    forcing.</li>
  <li> Analyses of global mean temperature and precipitation records that indicate 
    large variances within and among station data as a result of genuine climate 
    variance, as well as errors and biases resulting from instrument change, location 
    changes, or local urbanization. There are large differences in the length 
    of records because stations have been added over the century. Total record 
    length may vary widely. This necessitates large-scale analyses that average 
    the effects over many hundreds or thousands of stations so that the true climate 
    signal can emerge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Analogs in the biological realm are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Knowledge of fundamental responses of organisms to climate and extreme 
    events. This knowledge is based on experimental work in the laboratory on 
    physiological thresholds and metabolic costs of different thermal/ water regimes, 
    as well as experimental work in the field on ecological thresholds and fitness 
    costs of different temperature/water treatments. In addition to these controlled, 
    manipulated experiments, there are onsite observations of individuals and 
    populations before and after particular weather events (e.g., documentation 
    of population evolution of body size in birds caused by a single winter storm 
    or a single extreme drought, or population extinctions of butterflies caused 
    by a single midseason freeze or a single extreme drought year). The biological 
    community generally accepts the assertion that climate is a major influence 
    on the abundances and distributions of species.</li>
  <li> Geological evidence that shows changes in global mean temperature associated 
    with changes in the distributions of species. Species' ranges typically 
    shifted toward the poles by about 400-2,000 km between glacial and interglacial 
    periods (change of 4&deg;C).</li>
  <li> Ecological and biogeographic theory and models that accurately "predict" 
    current distributions of species, based on fundamental principles of climatic 
    tolerances.</li>
  <li> Analyses of biological records starting from the 1700s, when the first 
    researchers began to systematically record the timing of biological events 
    and the locations of species. There are some variances within and among the 
    historical records for any given species or locality as a result of genuine 
    variance of the biological trait as well as small errors resulting from changes 
    in the recorder, methods of recording, local urbanization, and other landscape 
    changes. There are large differences in the length of records because interest 
    in taking such records gradually has increased over the centuries. Total record 
    length may vary from 300 to &lt;10 years. This necessitates large-scale syntheses 
    that assess the effects over many hundreds of species or studies so that any 
    true global climate signal can emerge.</li>
