<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The small island states considered in this chapter are located mainly in the 
  tropics and the subtropics. These island states span the ocean regions of the 
  Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic, as well as the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas. 
  Because of the very nature of these states, the ocean exerts a major influence 
  on their physical, natural, and socioeconomic infrastructure and activities. 
</p>
<p>Although small island states are not a homogeneous group, they share many common 
  features that serve to increase their vulnerability to projected impacts of 
  climate change. These characteristics include their small physical size and 
  the fact that they are surrounded by large expanses of ocean; limited natural 
  resources; proneness to natural disasters and extreme events; relative isolation; 
  extreme openness of their economies, which are highly sensitive to external 
  shocks; large populations with high growth rates and densities; poorly developed 
  infrastructure; and limited funds, human resources, and skills. These characteristics 
  limit the capacity of small island states to mitigate and adapt to future climate 
  and sea-level change. </p>
<p>The most significant and immediate consequences for small island states are 
  likely to be related to changes in sea levels, rainfall regimes, soil moisture 
  budgets, and prevailing winds (speed and direction) and short-term variations 
  in regional and local patterns of wave action. Owing to their coastal location, 
  the majority of socioeconomic activities and infrastructure and the population 
  are likely to be highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea-level 
  rise.</p>
<p>Review of past and present trends of climate and climate variability indicates 
  that temperatures have been increasing by as much as 0.1&deg;C per decade, and 
  sea level has risen by 2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in regions in which small island states are 
  located. Analysis of observational data for these regions suggests that increases 
  in surface air temperatures have been greater than global rates of warming (e.g., 
  in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea regions). Observational evidence 
  also suggests that much of the variability in the rainfall record of Caribbean 
  and Pacific islands appears to be closely related to the onset of El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO). However, part of the variability in these areas also may 
  be attributable to the influence of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) 
  and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). It is acknowledged however, that 
  for some small islands it is difficult to establish clear trends of sea-level 
  change because of limitations of observational records, especially geodetic-controlled 
  tide gauge records.</p>
<p>The use of the state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation 
  models (AOGCMs) to estimate future response of climate to anthropogenic radiative 
  forcing suggests an enhanced climate change in the future. Several AOGCMs have 
  been analyzed for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean regions and the Caribbean 
  and Mediterranean Seas. The outputs from these models indicate general increases 
  in surface air temperature for the 2050s and 2080s and an increase in rainfall 
  of about 0.3% for the 2050s and 0.7% for the 2080s for the Pacific region. However, 
  a marginal decline in rainfall is projected for the other regions, with a possible 
  reduction of water availability. The diurnal temperature range is projected 
  to decrease marginally for the regions of the small island states for both time 
  horizons. </p>
<p>With respect to extreme events, AOGCM (CSIRO and ECHAM) transient experiments 
  project that by the 2050s and 2080s, there will be increased thermal stress 
  during summer, as well as more frequent droughts and floods in all four tropical 
  ocean regions in which small island states are located.This projection implies 
  that in the future these regions are likely to experience floods during wet 
  seasons and droughts during dry seasons. Furthermore, warming in some regions 
  (e.g., the Pacific Ocean) is likened to an El Ni&ntilde;o pattern, suggesting 
  that climate variability associated with the ENSO phenomenon will continue on 
  a seasonal and decadal time scale. It is probable that such an association may 
  dominate over any effects attributable to global warming. Given their high vulnerability 
  and low adaptive capacity to climate change, communities in the small island 
  states have legitimate concerns about their future on the basis of the past 
  observational record and climate model projections. In this Third Assessment 
  Report, analysis of the scientific-technical literature identifies the following 
  key issues among the priority concerns of small island states.</p>
<p><i>Development, sustainability, and equity issues.</i> The small island states 
  account for less than 1% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but are among 
  the most vulnerable of all locations to the potential adverse effects of climate 
  change and sea-level rise. Economic development and alleviation of poverty constitute 
  the single most critical concern of many small island states. Thus, with limited 
  resources and low adaptive capacity, these islands face the considerable challenge 
  of meeting the social and economic needs of their populations in a manner that 
  is sustainable. At the same time, they are forced to implement appropriate strategies 
  to adapt to increasing threats resulting from greenhouse gas forcing of the 
  climate system, to which they contribute little.</p>
<p><i>Sea-level rise.</i> Although there will be regional variation in the signal, 
  it is projected that sea level will rise by as much as 5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over the next 
  100 years as a result of GHG-induced global warming. This change in sea level 
  will have serious consequences for the social and economic development of many 
  small island states. For some islands, the most serious consideration will be 
  whether they will have adequate potential to adapt to sea-level rise within 
  their own national boundaries.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Beach and coastal changes.</i> Most coastal changes currently experienced 
  in the small island states are attributable to human activity. With the projected 
  increase in sea level over the next 50-100 years superimposed on further 
  shoreline development, however, the coastal assets of these states will be further 
  stressed. This added stress, in turn, will increase the vulnerability of coastal 
  environments by reducing natural resilience, while increasing the economic and 
  social "costs" of adaptation.</p>
<p><i>Biological systems.</i> Coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds, which 
  provide the economic foundation for many small islands, often rely on "stable" 
  coastal environments to sustain themselves. Although it is acknowledged that 
  human-induced stresses are contributing to their degradation, these systems 
  will be adversely affected by rising air temperature and sea levels. In most 
  small islands, coral reefs already are undergoing great stress from episodic 
  warming of the sea surface, causing widespread bleaching. Mangroves&#151;which 
  are common on low-energy, nutrient/sediment-rich coasts and embayments in the 
  tropics&#151;have been altered by human activities. Changes in sea levels are 
  likely to affect landward and longshore migration of remnants of mangrove forests, 
  which provide some protection for the coasts and backshore infrastructure. It 
  is projected that changes in the availability of sediment supply, coupled with 
  increases in temperature and water depth as a consequence of sea-level rise, 
  will adversely impact the productivity and physiological functions of seagrasses. 
  Consequently, this would have a negative downstream effect on fish populations 
  that feed on these communities.</p>
<p><i>Biodiversity.</i> It is estimated that 33% of known threatened plants are 
  island endemics, and 23% of bird species found on islands also are threatened. 
  Although there is still some uncertainty about precisely how and to what extent 
  biodiversity and wildlife in small islands will be affected, available projections 
  suggest that climate change and sea-level rise will cause unfavorable shifts 
  in biotic composition and adversely affect competition among some species.</p>
<p><i>Water resources, agriculture, and fisheries. </i>The availability of water 
  resources and food remain critical concerns in island communities. In many countries, 
  water already is in short supply because islands (many of which are drought-prone) 
  rely heavily on rainwater from small catchments or limited freshwater lenses. 
  Arable land for crop agriculture often is in short supply; thus, the likely 
  prospect of land loss and soil salinization as a consequence of climate change 
  and sea-level rise will threaten the sustainability of both subsistence and 
  commercial agriculture in these islands. Because water resources and agriculture 
  are so climate sensitive, it is expected that these sectors also will be adversely 
  affected by future climate and sea-level change. Although climate change is 
  not expected to have a significant impact on world fisheries output, it is projected 
  to have a severe impact on the abundance and distribution of reef fish population 
  on the islands.</p>
<p><i>Human health, settlement and infrastructure, and tourism. </i>Several human 
  systems are likely to be affected by projected changes in climate and sea levels 
  in many small island states. Human health is a major concern in many tropical 
  islands, which currently are experiencing a high incidence of vector- and water-borne 
  diseases. This is attributable partly to changes in temperature and rainfall, 
  which may be linked to the ENSO phenomenon, and partly to changes in the patterns 
  of droughts and floods. Climate extremes also place a huge burden on human welfare; 
  this burden is likely to increase in the future. Almost all settlements, socioeconomic 
  infrastructure, and activities such as tourism in many island states are located 
  at or near coastal areas. Their location alone renders them highly vulnerable 
  to future climate change and sea-level rise. Tourism is a major revenue earner 
  and generates significant employment in many small islands. Changes in temperature 
  and rainfall regimes, as well as loss of beaches, could be devastating for the 
  economies that rely on this sector. Because climate change and sea-level rise 
  are inevitable in the future, it is vital that beach and coastal assets in the 
  small island states are managed wisely. Integrated coastal management has been 
  identified and proposed as an effective framework for accomplishing this goal.</p>
<p><i>Sociocultural and traditional assets</i>. Other island assets, such as know-how 
  and traditional skills (technologies), are under threat from climate change 
  and sea-level rise. In some societies, community structures and assets such 
  as important traditional sites of worship, ritual, and ceremony&#151;particularly 
  those at or near the coasts&#151;could be adversely affected by future climate 
  change and sea-level rise.</p>
<p>It is significant to note that although many vulnerability assessment methodologies 
  have been applied to different regions of the world with varying degrees of 
  success, global assessments have consistently identified the small island states 
  as one of the most high-risk areas, irrespective of methodology employed. This 
  evidently robust finding must be of considerable concern to these states. It 
  is further established that climate change is inevitable as a result of past 
  GHG emissions and that small islands are likely to suffer disproportionately 
  from the enhanced effects of climate change and sea-level rise. Hence, identification 
  and implementation of effective adaptation measures and avoidance of maladaptation 
  ( i.e., measures that increase exposure rather than decrease vulnerability) 
  are critical for small islands, even if there is swift implementation of any 
  global agreement to reduce future emissions.</p>
<p>For most small islands, the reality of climate change is just one of many serious 
  challenges with which they are confronted. Such pressing socioeconomic concerns 
  as poverty alleviation; high unemployment; and the improvement of housing, education, 
  and health care facilities all compete for the slender resources available to 
  these countries. In these circumstances, progress in adaptation to climate change 
  almost certainly will require integration of appropriate risk reduction strategies 
  with other sectoral policy initiatives in areas such as sustainable development 
  planning, disaster prevention and management, integrated coastal management, 
  and health care planning.</p>
