<h2>9.6. Air Pollution </h2>
<h3><a name="961"></a>9.6.1. Gases, Fine Particulates </h3>
<p>Weather conditions influence air pollution via pollutant (or pollutant precursor) 
  transport and/or formation. Weather conditions also can influence biogenic (e.g., 
  pollen production) and anthropogenic (e.g., as a result of increased energy 
  demand) air pollutant emissions. Exposure to air pollutants can have many serious 
  health effects, especially following severe pollution episodes. Studies that 
  are relevant to climate change and air pollution can be divided into two categories: 
  those that estimate the combined impact of weather and air pollutants on health 
  outcomes and those that estimate future air pollution levels. Climate change 
  may increase the concentration of ground-level ozone, but the magnitude of the 
  effect is uncertain (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). For other pollutants, the effects 
  of climate change and/or weather are less well studied. </p>
<p>Current air pollution problems are greatest in developing country cities. For 
  example, nearly 40,000 people die prematurely every year in India because of 
  outdoor air pollution (World Bank, 1997). Air quality also is one of the main 
  concerns for environmental health in developed countries (Bertollini <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; COMEAP, 1998). <br>
  <br>
  Radon is an inert radioactive gas. The rate at which it is emitted from the 
  ground is sensitive to temperature (United Nations, 1982). High indoor exposures 
  are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (IARC, 1988). There is 
  some evidence from modeling experiments that climate warming may increase radon 
  concentrations in the lower atmosphere (Cuculeanu and Iorgulescu, 1994). <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9611"></a>9.6.1.1. Effects of Air Pollution, Season, and Weather 
  on Health </h4>
<p>The six standard air pollutants that have been extensively studied in urban 
  populations are sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen 
  dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), lead, and particulates. The 
  impact of some air pollutants on health is more evident during the summer or 
  during high temperatures (Bates and Sizto, 1987; Bates <i>et al</i>., 1990; 
  Castellsague <i>et al</i>., 1995; Bobak and Roberts, 1997; Katsouyanni <i>et 
  al</i>., 1997; Spix <i>et al</i>., 1998; de Diego Damia <i>et al</i>., 1999; 
  Hajat <i>et al</i>., 1999). For example, the relationship between SO2 and total 
  and cardiovascular mortality in Valencia (Ballester <i>et al</i>., 1996) and 
  Barcelona, Spain (Sunyer <i>et al</i>., 1996), and Rome, Italy (Michelozzi <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998), was found to be stronger during hot periods than during winter. 
  However, Moolgavkar <i>et al</i>. (1995) conclude that, in Philadelphia, SO2 
  had the strongest health effects in spring, autumn, and winter. Increases in 
  daily mortality and morbidity (indicated by hospital admissions) are associated 
  with high ozone levels on hot days in many cities (e.g., Moolgavkar <i>et al</i>., 
  1995; Sunyer <i>et al</i>., 1996; Touloumi <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>High temperatures also have acute effects on mortality (see <a href="353.htm">Section 
  9.4.1</a>). Some studies have found evidence of an interaction between the effects 
  of ozone and the effects of higher temperatures (e.g., Katsouyanni <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Sartor <i>et al</i>., 1995). Other studies addressing the combined effects 
  of weather and particulate air pollution have not found evidence of such an 
  interaction (e.g., Samet <i>et al</i>., 1998). Correlations between climate 
  and site-specific air quality variables must be further evaluated and, in some 
  instances, need to include temperature, pollution, and interaction terms in 
  regression models.</p>
<p>Climate change is expected to increase the risk of forest and rangeland fires 
  (see <a href="246.htm#56221">Section 5.6.2.2.1</a>). Haze-type air pollution 
  therefore is a potential impact of climate change on health. Majors fires in 
  1997 in southeast Asia and the Americas were associated with increases in respiratory 
  and eye symptoms (Brauer, 1999; WHO, 1999b). In Malaysia, a two- to three-fold 
  increase in outpatient visits for respiratory disease and a 14% decrease in 
  lung function in school children were reported. In Alta Floresta, Brazil, there 
  was a 20-fold increase in outpatient visits for respiratory disease. In 1998, 
  fires in Florida were linked to significant increases in emergency department 
  visits for asthma (91%), bronchitis (132%), and chest pain (37%) (CDC, 1999). 
  However, a study of 1994 bushfires in western Sydney showed no increase in asthma 
  admissions to emergency departments (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<h4><a name="9612"></a>9.6.1.2. Future Changes in Air Quality </h4>
<p>Weather has a major influence on the dispersal and ambient concentrations of 
  air pollutants. Large high-pressure systems often create an inversion of the 
  normal temperature profile, trapping pollutants in the shallow boundary layer 
  at the Earth's surface. It is difficult to predict the impact of climate 
  change on local urban climatology and, therefore, on average local air pollution 
  concentrations. However, any increase in anticyclonic conditions in summer would 
  tend to increase air pollution concentrations in cities (Hulme and Jenkins, 
  1998). </p>
<p>Formation and destruction of ozone is accelerated by increases in temperature 
  and ultraviolet radiation. Existing air quality models have been used to examine 
  the effect of climate change on ozone concentrations (e.g., Morris <i>et al</i>., 
  1989; Penner <i>et al</i>., 1989; Morris <i>et al</i>., 1995; Sillman and Samson, 
  1995). The models indicate that decreases in stratospheric ozone and elevated 
  temperature increase ground-level ozone concentration. An increase in occurrence 
  of hot days could increase biogenic and anthropogenic emissions of volatile 
  organic compounds (e.g., from increased evaporative emissions from fuel-injected 
  automobiles) (Sillman and Samson, 1995). These studies of the impact of climate 
  change on air quality must be considered indicative but by no means definitive. 
  Important local weather factors may not be adequately represented in these models.</p>
