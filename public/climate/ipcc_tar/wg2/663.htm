<h2>19.2. Observations of Climate Change Impacts </h2>
<p>It is well established from physical, ecological, and physiological studies 
  that climate strongly influences physical and biological systems. This section 
  addresses whether changes in regional climate during the 20th century, documented 
  by WGI, have resulted in measurable impacts on physical and biological systems. 
  We also consider the potential for detecting observed impacts of regional climate 
  change in socioeconomic systems. The objective here is to evaluate the accumulating 
  body of evidence with regard to the following questions:</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Is there a coherent signal in patterns of observed impacts?<br>
  <li> Are observed effects of regional climate changes consistent with functional 
    understanding and modeled predictions of impacts? <br>
  <li> Do observed effects provide information about the potential vulnerability 
    of systems to climate change?<br>
  <li> How do impacts observed over the past century relate to the five reasons 
    for concern brought forward by this chapter?<br>
    In relation to the five reasons for concern, the accumulating body of studies 
    documenting observed impacts of regional climate changes may contribute to 
    understanding of: 
    <ul>
      <li>Actual and potential climate change effects on unique and threatened 
        systems <br>
      </li>
      <li>Relationships of impacts to changes in extreme events<br>
      </li>
      <li>Functional and geographical distribution of current and future climate 
        change effects <br>
      </li>
      <li>Aggregation of impacts <br>
      </li>
      <li>Potential effects of large-scale singularities. </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>In this section, we focus on observed impacts that have been associated with 
  regional climate changes over the past 100 years. We examine evidence in physical 
  and biological systems in terrestrial, coastal and marine, and freshwater environments, 
  as well as in socioeconomic systems, including agriculture, commercial fisheries, 
  human settlements, insurance and financial services, and human health (see also 
  other chapters in this report).</p>
<p>The studies reviewed document an observed impact in a physical, biological, 
  or socioeconomic system associated with changes in one or more regional climate 
  variables (most often temperature rise). The effects are examined with regard 
  to the range and geographical extent of processes and species involved, their 
  consistency with functional understanding of mechanisms or processes involved 
  in climate-impact relationships, and the possibility of alternative explanations 
  and confounding factors. Expected directions of change relating to regional 
  climate warming for physical systems include shrinkage of glaciers, decrease 
  in snow cover, shortening of duration of lake and river ice cover, declines 
  in sea-ice extent and thickness, lengthening of frost-free seasons, and intensification 
  of the hydrological cycle. Expected directions of change relating to regional 
  climate warming for biological systems include poleward and elevational shifts 
  in distribution and earlier phenology (i.e., earlier breeding, emergence, flowering) 
  in plant and animal species.</p>
<p>We follow the WGI definition of climate change as a statistically significant 
  variation in the mean state of the climate or its variability, persisting for 
  an extended period (typically decades or longer). Climate change, as defined 
  here, may be caused by natural internal processes or external forcings or by 
  persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land 
  use.</p>
<p>Since 1860, the global mean temperature has warmed 0.6 &plusmn; 0.2&deg;C; 
  regional temperature changes have varied, ranging from greater than 0.6&deg;C 
  to cooling in some regions (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). Annual land-surface precipitation has increased (0.5-1% per decade) 
  in most middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, except over eastern 
  Asia. In contrast, over much of the subtropical land areas, rainfall has decreased 
  during the 20th century (0.3% per decade), although it has been recovering in 
  recent years (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). 
  The recent warming period began in 1976, with pronounced warming observed in 
  northwestern North America, central northern Asia, and the southern Pacific 
  Ocean. Detection of climate change and attribution of causes are discussed in 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/439.htm">Chapter 12</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="1921"></a>19.2.1. Methods of Analysis </h3>
<p>Accumulation of evidence over time and space, based on numerous individual 
  studies, is needed to detect and characterize patterns and processes of observed 
  climate change impacts on a global basis (see <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). 
  In many studies, changes in impact systems are compared with trends in climate 
  variables over the same period and location. Many studies establish statistically 
  significant trends in the observed impact and the climate variable, as well 
  as a statistically significant association between the two (e.g., Beebee, 1995; 
  Brown et al., 1999; Barber et al., 2000). Others refer to trends in climate 
  documented elsewhere (e.g., Menzel and Fabian, 1999; Thomas and Lennon, 1999). 
  When multiple species or locations are examined, cases are reported that exhibit 
  no change, change that is consistent with understanding of climate-impact relationships, 
  and change that is inconsistent with understanding of climate-impact relationships. 
  This allows for assessment of whether observed changes are significantly different 
  from random chance and are consistent with functional understanding of climate 
  responses (e.g., Ellis, 1997; Ellis et al., 1997; Bradley et al., 1999; Pounds 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Individual studies that link observed impacts to regional climate change may 
  be hampered by methodological problems such as length of time-series data of 
  observed impacts; number of replications of populations, census sites, or species; 
  availability of climate data to which to compare observed changes; and uncertainty 
  about whether observed impacts and regional climate variables are measured at 
  appropriate spatial scales (<a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). In some regions, 
  several individual studies have focused on differing aspects of a common ecosystem, 
  providing evidence for associations between climate change and multiple responses 
  in a given geographical area (e.g., Smith et al., 1999); in other regions, however, 
  studies examine more isolated responses.</p>
<p>Because changing climate and ecological responses are linked over a range of 
  temporal scales, long periods of study allow more accurate conclusions regarding 
  the significance of observed ecosystem changes. Large-amplitude temporal changes 
  usually involve large spatial dimensions, so broad-scale spatial/temporal ecosystem 
  studies tend to be more robust. The majority of studies document trends for 
  periods of more than 20 years (e.g., Post et al., 1997; Winkel and Hudde, 1997; 
  Post and Stenseth, 1999); a few studies document trends for 10-19 years 
  (e.g., Jarvinen, 1994; Forchhammer et al., 1998); and several studies analyze 
  data from two periods with a gap between them (Bradley et al., 1999; Sagarin 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Climate Trends: The various studies of observed impacts of recorded regional 
  temperature change over the past century, which include the recent warm decades 
  of the 1980s and 1990s, often differentiate responses to mean, minimum, and 
  maximum temperatures. Regional precipitation changes and periods of droughts 
  and floods are much more variable in observed records and more uncertain with 
  regard to future predictions and are not the primary focus here. Studies also 
  have considered possible observed responses to the rising atmospheric concentrations 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> over the past century, but these studies are not included in this review.</p>
<p>To the extent that periodicities or trends are found in the climate record, 
  nonzero autocorrelations are to be expected on the interannual time scale. Their 
  importance depends on the percentage of variance associated with the periodicities 
  and the magnitude of the trend relative to interannual noise. Often the periodicities 
  represent only a small proportion of the total variance; this is especially 
  true on a local level, where the noise is likely to be higher than at broader 
  spatial scales. A nonzero autocorrelation does not automatically mean the year-to-year 
  ecological impact is not meaningful because if year-to-year climate variability 
  is associated with a periodic or steadily increasing climate forcing, so too 
  would be the ecological response.</p>
<p>Processes and Mechanisms: Beyond statistical association, an important aspect 
  of many studies is comparison of documented changes to known relationships between 
  climate and impact systems. For example, under regional warming, retreat of 
  glaciers is expected because of shifts in the energy balance of glaciers, as 
  is poleward expansion of species' ranges when temperatures exceed physiological 
  thresholds. If documented changes are consistent with known processes that link 
  climate and the impact system, confidence in the associations between changes 
  in regional climate and observed changes is enhanced. </p>
<p>Multiple Causal Factors: The presence of multiple causal factors (e.g., land-use 
  change, pollution, biotic invasion) makes attribution of many observed impacts 
  to regional climate change a complex challenge at the individual study and meta-analysis 
  levels (e.g., Prop et al., 1998; K&ouml;rner, 1999). Some of the competing explanations 
  for observed impacts themselves could have a common driver that would make them 
  strongly correlated; identifying these drivers is a methodological challenge. 
  Studies seek to document observed climate change impacts by ruling out other 
  possible contributing causative factors, ecological or anthropogenic, through 
  study design and sampling techniques (e.g., Parmesan, 1996; Menzel and Fabian, 
  1999; Parmesan et al., 1999), statistical analyses (e.g., Prop et al., 1998; 
  Reading, 1998), or expert judgment (De Jong and Brakefield, 1998; Brown et al., 
  1999). Sometimes, different studies offer alternative explanations for observed 
  impacts (e.g., K&ouml;rner, 1999).</p>
<p>Signals of regional climate change impacts may be clearer in physical systems 
  than in biological systems, which are simultaneously undergoing many complex 
  changes that are not related to climate, including land-use change and pollution 
  processes such as eutrophication and acidification. Observed impacts in high-latitude 
  and high-altitude physical systems, such as melting of glaciers, may be more 
  straightforward to detect, whereas biological responses to climate tend to be 
  more complex and may be masked by the presence of the aforementioned multiple 
  causal factors. To deal with these ecological complexities, confounding factors 
  often are minimized by conducting studies away from large urban or agricultural 
  areas, in large natural areas (e.g., northern Canada, Australia), or in preserved 
  areas.</p>
<p>Signals of regional climate change impacts probably are most difficult to detect 
  in socioeconomic systems because such systems are strongly affected by simultaneous 
  trends in population and income growth and urbanization and because of the presence 
  of adaptive capacity (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>). Observed climate 
  change impacts in socioecosystems may be adaptations in many cases, such as 
  farmers sowing crops earlier in response to warmer spring temperatures.</p>
<p>An example of these methodological complexities in climate change impact detection 
  may be drawn from the human health sector. Although climate is known to influence 
  many disease vectors (such as the range of anopheline mosquitos that carry malaria), 
  the presence or absence of sanitation systems, vaccination programs, adequate 
  nutritional conditions, animal husbandry, irrigation, and land-use management 
  also influences whether the presence of a disease in wild vectors leads to disease 
  outbreaks in human populations (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). </p>
<p>Evaluating Patterns of Change: Grouping individual studies to evaluate patterns 
  and processes of change on larger spatial scales reduces the influences of study-specific 
  biases and local nonclimatic factors. Comparing expected geographical patterns 
  of responses to regional climate changes and to changes that are not related 
  to climate helps distinguish among multiple possible causations. For example, 
  regional warming would be expected to skew the distribution of insect extinctions 
  to be greater at the southern boundaries rather than at the northern boundaries; 
  land-use change, in contrast, would be expected to cause approximately equal 
  extinctions at both range boundaries (Parmesan, 1996; Parmesan et al., 1999). 
  Care must be taken to ensure that the sample of studies is representative across 
  time and space, is not biased in reporting, and uses appropriate statistical 
  tests. Spottiness of evidence in other regions may indicate that observed impacts 
  of regional climate change are not occurring, have not yet been detected, or 
  are being masked by other changes, such as urbanization.</p>
<p>Some studies of observed impacts have used a "fingerprint" approach, 
  based on the definition of expected biological changes arising from regional 
  climate change (e.g., Epstein et al., 1998). This approach is similar to that 
  used in detection of climate changes (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>) but differs in that fingerprint studies of ecosystem impacts use selected 
  data and that long-term monitoring of changes in ecosystems generally is lacking 
  at regional or global scales. </p>
