<h4>11.1.3.3. Precipitation</h4>

      <b>Figure 11-6:</b> Projected changes in area-averaged annual (a) and seasonal 
      [(b) DJF and (c) JJA)] mean surface air temperature and precipitation over 
      land regions of Asia for the 2050s and 2080s as obtained in select AOGCMs. 
    </td>

</table>
<p><a name="fig116"></a>In general, all AOGCMs simulate an enhanced hydrological 
  cycle and an increase in annual mean rainfall over most of Asia (Giorgi and 
  Francisco, 2000). An area-averaged annual mean increase in precipitation of 
  3&plusmn;1% in the 2020s, 7&plusmn;2% in the 2050s, and 11&plusmn;3% in the 
  2080s over the land regions of Asia is projected as a result of future increases 
  in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Under the combined influence of GHGs 
  and sulfate aerosols, the projected increase in precipitation is limited to 
  2&plusmn;1% in the decade 2020s, 3&plusmn;1% in the 2050s, and 7&plusmn;3% in 
  the 2080s. <a href="#fig116">Figure 11-6</a> depicts projected changes in precipitation 
  relative to changes in surface air temperature, averaged for land regions of 
  Asia for each of the four skilled AOGCMs on an annual mean basis as well as 
  during winter and summer for the 2050s and 2080s. The increase in precipitation 
  is maximum during NH winter for both the time periods (Lal and Harasawa, 2000b). 
  Clearly, intermodel differences in projections of precipitation are relatively 
  large particularly during the winter even when they are averaged for the entire 
  Asian continent&#151;suggesting low confidence in projections of future precipitation 
  in current AOGCMs.</p>
<p>The increase in annual mean precipitation is projected to be highest in boreal 
  Asia. During the winter, boreal Asia and the Tibetan Plateau have the most pronounced 
  increase in precipitation (<a href="421.htm#tab112">Table 11-2</a>). Over central 
  Asia, an increase in winter precipitation and a decrease in summer precipitation 
  are projected. Because the rainfall over this region is already low, severe 
  water stress conditions&#151;leading to expansion of deserts&#151;are quite 
  possible with a rise in surface air temperature here. The area-averaged annual 
  mean and winter precipitation is projected to increase in temperate Asia. The 
  models show high uncertainty in projections of future winter and summer precipitation 
  over south Asia (with or without direct aerosol forcings). The effect of sulfate 
  aerosols on Indian summer monsoon precipitation is to dampen the strength of 
  the monsoon compared to that seen with GHGs only (Lal et al., 1995a; Mitchell 
  et al., 1995; Cubasch et al., 1996; Roeckner et al., 1999). The overall effect 
  of the combined forcing is at least partly dependent on the land/sea distribution 
  of aerosol forcing and on whether the indirect effect is included along with 
  the direct effect. To date, the effect of aerosol forcing (direct and indirect) 
  on the variability of the monsoon has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Recent observations suggest that there is no appreciable long-term variation 
  in the total number of tropical cyclones observed in the north Indian, southwest 
  Indian, and southwest Pacific Oceans east of 160&deg;E (Neumann, 1993; Lander 
  and Guard, 1998). For the northwest subtropical Pacific basin, Chan and Shi 
  (1996) found that the frequency of typhoons and the total number of tropical 
  storms and typhoons has been more variable since about 1980. Several studies 
  since the SAR have considered likely changes in tropical cyclones (Henderson-Sellers 
  et al., 1998; Knutson et al., 1998; Krishnamurti et al., 1998; Royer et al., 
  1998). Some of these studies suggest an increase in tropical storm intensities 
  with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-induced warming. </p>
<p>Some of the most pronounced year-to-year variability in climate features in 
  many parts of Asia has been linked to ENSO. Since the SAR, analysis of several 
  new AOGCM results indicates that as global temperatures increase, the Pacific 
  climate will tend to resemble a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like state (Mitchell et 
  al., 1995; Meehl and Washington, 1996; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Boer et al., 
  1999; Timmermann et al., 1999). Collins (1999) finds an increased frequency 
  of ENSO events and a shift in their seasonal cycle in a warmer atmosphere: The 
  maximum occurs between August and October rather than around January as currently 
  observed. Meehl and Washington (1996) indicate that future seasonal precipitation 
  extremes associated with a given ENSO event are likely to be more intense in 
  the tropical Indian Ocean region; anomalously wet areas could become wetter, 
  and anomalously dry areas could become drier during future ENSO events. </p>
<p>Several recent studies (Kitoh et al., 1997; Lal et al., 2000) have confirmed 
  earlier results (Kattenberg et al., 1996) indicating an increase in interannual 
  variability of daily precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon with increased 
  GHGs. Lal et al. (2000) also report an increase in intraseasonal precipitation 
  variability and suggest that intraseasonal and interannual increases are associated 
  with increased intraseasonal convective activity during the summer. The intensity 
  of extreme rainfall events is projected to be higher in a warmer atmosphere, 
  suggesting a decrease in return period for extreme precipitation events and 
  the possibility of more frequent flash floods in parts of India, Nepal, and 
  Bangladesh (Lal et al., 2000). However, Lal et al. (1995b) found no significant 
  change in the number and intensity of monsoon depressions (which are largely 
  responsible for the observed interannual variability of rainfall in the central 
  plains of India) in the Bay of Bengal in a warmer climate. Because much of tropical 
  Asia is intrinsically linked with the annual monsoon cycle, a better understanding 
  of the future behavior of the monsoon and its variability is warranted for economic 
  planning, disaster mitigation, and development of adaptation strategies to cope 
  with climate variability and climate change.</p>
