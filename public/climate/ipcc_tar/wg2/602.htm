<h3><a name="1623"></a>16.2.3. Changes in the Southern Ocean and Impacts on its Life</h3>
<h4><a name="16231"></a>16.2.3.1. Overview</h4>
<p>The Southern Ocean is an active component of the climate system that causes 
  natural climate variability on time scales from years to centuries. It is a 
  major thermal regulator and has the potential to play an active role in climate 
  change by providing important feedbacks. If climate change is sustained, it 
  is likely to produce long-term and perhaps irreversible changes in the Southern 
  Ocean. These changes will alter the nature and amount of life in the ocean and 
  on surrounding islands, shores, and ice. The impact of climate change is likely 
  to be manifest in the large-scale physical environment and in biological dynamics. 
  There even is the possibility that changes in the Southern Ocean could trigger 
  abrupt and very long-term changes that affect the climate of the entire globe.</p>
<h4><a name="16232"></a>16.2.3.2. Role of Ocean Changes </h4>
<p>The Southern Ocean is of special significance to climate change because of 
  the variety of water masses produced there and the ability of these waters to 
  spread throughout the global ocean. In particular, shelf waters with temperatures 
  near the freezing point (about -1.9&deg;C) are produced along the margin of 
  the Antarctic continent. They contribute to the formation of Antarctic bottomwater 
  and continuing ventilation of this water in the world's oceans (Whitworth 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). There already is evidence that climate change has altered SAMW 
  and AAIW (Johnson and Orsi, 1997; Wong <i>et al</i>., 1999; Bindoff and McDougall, 
  2000). Wong <i>et al</i>. (1999) compared trans-Pacific sections 20 years apart and 
  found temperature and salinity changes that are consistent with surface warming 
  and freshening in formation regions of the water masses in the Southern Ocean 
  and their subsequent subduction into the ocean.<br>
</p>
<p>The main contributions to the production of Antarctic bottomwater come from 
  cooling and transformation of seawater under the floating Filchner-Ronne and 
  Ross ice shelves, as well as from dense water formed as a result of freezing 
  of sea ice. Polynyas also are important. These areas of combined open water 
  and thin sea ice (surrounded by sea ice or land ice) play an important role 
  in ocean-atmosphere heat transfer, ice production, formation of dense shelf 
  water, spring disintegration of sea ice, and sustenance of primary and secondary 
  productivity in polar regions. Their formation is linked to the strength and 
  persistence of cold outflow winds off the Antarctic continent and the position 
  of the polar jet stream and Southern Ocean atmospheric circulation patterns 
  (Bromwich <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Research by Wu <i>et al</i>., (1997), Budd and Wu (1998), and Hirst (1999)&#151;using 
  the CSIRO coupled, transient model and IPCC IS92a emissions scenario&#151;suggests 
  that certain aspects of Southern Ocean circulation may be very sensitive to 
  climate change. With an increase in atmospheric equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>, there 
  is a substantial increase in the strength of the near-surface halocline and 
  a potential reduction in the formation of Antarctic bottomwater and convection 
  in the Southern Ocean. The decrease in downwelling of cold, dense water, as 
  shown in <a href="601.htm#fig165">Figure 16-5</a>, leads to a slowdown in the 
  thermohaline circulation (Broecker <i>et al</i>., 1985). A tripling of GHGs 
  is sufficient to induce a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, 
  this shutdown continues for at least several centuries, to the end of the model 
  integration. The main processes causing a decline in the thermohaline circulation 
  are an increase in precipitation minus evaporation, an increase in glacial melt 
  from the Antarctic, and reduced sea-ice formation, so there is less brine injection 
  into the ocean.<br>
</p>
<p>According to this simulation, if concentrations of GHGs continue to grow to 
  the end of the 21st century, there will be significant weakening of the ocean's 
  thermohaline circulation and even potential for its shutdown. These changes 
  might become irreversible in subsequent centuries, despite possible stabilization 
  of GHG concentrations. Modeling by Cai and Baines (1996) indicates that the 
  Antarctic Circumpolar Current is driven at least partly by the thermohaline 
  circulation associated with the formation of Antarctic bottomwater, so this 
  major current of the Southern Ocean also can be expected to slow down. This 
  result is confirmed by Cai and Gordon (1998), who found a clear decreasing trend 
  in the magnitude of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as CO<sub>2</sub> increases. 
  The foregoing results indicate an ocean circulation that is significantly more 
  sensitive to climate change than that found by Manabe and Stouffer (1994). The 
  possibility remains that certain factors and parameterizations in the Hirst 
  (1999) model could make it overly sensitive and that future changes may not 
  be as dramatic as indicated. For example, in other models the ocean component 
  is much less diffusive, allowing for prolonged maintenance of an enhanced halocline. 
  None of the present generation of climate models can resolve polynyas, where 
  the majority of brine rejection takes place and dense water masses form. These 
  processes need to be better represented in coupled ocean-climate models before 
  the timing of any substantial slowing of Antarctic bottomwater production or 
  of any shutdown of the ocean thermohaline circulation can be predicted confidently. 
  Changes in this circulation also may be driven by variable fluxes at lower latitudes, 
  and results from different ocean models indicate uncertainty about the magnitude 
  and timing of thermohaline slowdown (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a> for more detailed discussion of the global thermohaline circulation).</p>
<h4><a name="16233"></a>16.2.3.3. Role of Ice Shelves </h4>
<p>The sensitivity of the Southern Ocean to changes in ice shelves remains uncertain 
  (Williams <i>et al</i>., 1998a,b); it depends on whether there is free access 
  of oceanic water to their underside (Nicholls, 1997). Circulation of meltwater 
  under the ice shelves is complex. Any increase in melting as a result of global 
  warming initially will introduce a fresher layer of water (see Jacobs <i>et 
  al</i>., 1992; Jenkins <i>et al</i>., 1997; O'Farrell <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  This could restrict further melting, unless the current or tides are strong 
  enough to flush the fresher layer away or entrain it into other water masses. 
  Using a three-dimensional model adapted to the underside of the Amery Ice Shelf, 
  Williams <i>et al</i>. (1998b) conclude that when the adjacent seas were warmed 
  by 1&deg;C, net melt increased more than three-fold. Grosfeld and Gerdes (1998) 
  also show increased net melt with warming, but the situation stabilizes if there 
  is less sea-ice formation. In considering the long-term response of the Antarctic 
  ice sheet to global warming of 3&deg;C, Warner and Budd (1998) show that it 
  takes at least several centuries for the ice shelves to disappear in their model.</p>
