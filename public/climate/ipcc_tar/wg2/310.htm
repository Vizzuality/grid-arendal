<h4>7.2.2.1. Resource-Dependent Settlements </h4>
<p>What makes resource-dependent settlements unique is the extent to which they 
  are dependent on and tuned to the natural resources of the region and the extent 
  to which they are vulnerable to changes in these natural resources. Resource 
  dependency emphasizes the impact of climate change on the economic livelihood 
  of inhabitants. An extreme form of resource-dependent settlements are settlements 
  of traditional peoples, including hunter-gatherer communities, subsistence agricultural 
  settlements, artisanal fishing communities, and the like. The issues are somewhat 
  different in different locations, as indicated below. </p>
<h4><a name="72211"></a>7.2.2.1.1. Arid and semi-arid regions </h4>
<p>Human societies have been developing by adaptation to the arid environment 
  in desert regions for centuries. An example is the oasis water supply system 
  called karez, qanats, or foggaras. For adaptation or mitigation, windbreaks 
  are a powerful method to reduce the effects of the strong winds, dust storms, 
  and sand dune movements (Du et al., 1996; Maki et al., 1997a,b). In addition, 
  trees in windbreaks provide materials for construction and firewood for people, 
  keep a better hygienic environment in the settlements, and improve conditions 
  for crops and livestock. </p>
<p>Social vulnerabilities in arid regions include low income among residents as 
  a result of underdevelopment of industry in the oases, difficulty in telecommunication 
  and transportation between oases, and growing human pressure on the limited 
  land base, as illustrated by the scarcity of suitable irrigable land in oases 
  in the Taklimakan Desert, northwest China (Yoshino, 1997c, 1998). On the northern 
  rim of the Taklimakan desert, only 4-4.5% of the land is available for irrigation, 
  and only about 2% on the south rim is available. Although these limit values 
  vary from desert to desert because of the amount of available water, scarcity 
  of suitable land is a vulnerable feature of settlements in all arid regions. 
  In northern Africa, southwest Asia, and parts of the Middle East, there is a 
  belt of entire countries that currently suffer from inadequate water supplies 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Increasing temperatures and reduction 
  in rainfall would further limit these settlements.</p>

</table>
<p><a name="fig72"></a>Climate change could reduce water availability in the semi-arid 
  savanna ecosystem of tropical Africa, affecting farmers, herders, and tourist-industry 
  workers, which in turn will impact human settlements. Conflict already occurs 
  between herdsmen and farmers in this region, and the SAR discussed the impacts 
  on major cities when people leave the land (see <a href="377.htm">Chapter 10</a>). 
</p>
<p>Small settlements in arid/semi-arid regions occasionally confront a higher 
  risk of damage by flooding than their counterparts in more humid environments. 
  This is usually because of the longer return periods or rarity of extreme rainfall. 
  However, in a warmer world the frequency of these intense storms in semi-arid 
  and arid regions may increase (Smith, 1996; Smith and Handmer, 1996; Smith et 
  al., 1999). During extreme rainfall events, houses, roads, irrigation systems, 
  and other constructions are destroyed and human settlements in oases are isolated 
  because telecommunication and traffic connections are broken. Because settlements 
  have been adapted to dry conditions, the total numbers of deaths and the total 
  amount of damages caused by drought and other impacts of dry conditions often 
  are smaller than those caused by heavy rainfall. </p>
<h4><a name="72212"></a>7.2.2.1.2. Polar and subpolar settlements </h4>
<p>There are two major types of polar and subpolar settlements: traditional indigenous 
  communities that are based on hunting and gathering activities such as whaling, 
  caribou hunting, and seal hunting and modern "outpost" settlements such as military, 
  mining, and oil camps. The more traditional settlements are economically vulnerable 
  to changes in the regional ecology that might occur as a result of climate change 
  (changes in sea ice, migration routes, or abundance of game species). Although 
  military and mining operations generally would not be concerned with game species, 
  impacts of warming on permafrost areas, sea lanes, and flying weather could 
  significantly improve or reduce the efficiency of resource extraction (Cohen, 
  1997). Infrastructure in both types of settlements is vulnerable to permafrost 
  melting, desiccation during warming, landslides, and flooding (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 
  16</a>). </p>
<h4><a name="72213"></a>7.2.2.1.3. Forest settlements </h4>
<p>Traditional settlements of indigenous peoples still exist in (mostly tropical) 
  portions of Africa, Asia and nearby islands, and Latin America. Although these 
  societies engage in subsistence agriculture and some cash activities such as 
  guiding tourists, much of their economy is based on subsistence hunting and 
  gathering. Already under threat from growth in farming, mining, and commercial 
  forestry activities (which may themselves be affected by climate change), under 
  climate change the traditional forest communities would face the additional 
  challenge of changed ecology, which could change the availability of key species 
  and adversely affect the sustainability of these communities. </p>
<h4><a name="72214"></a>7.2.2.1.4. Agricultural and fisheries settlements and 
  related industry </h4>
<p>Agroindustry is considered to be among the more adaptable industries affected 
  by climate change. Brown and Rosenberg (1996) and Brown et al. (1998) were able 
  to show, for example, that growing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) for biomass 
  is an effective adaptation in the warmer, drier climates expected in central 
  North America under climate change. <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a> also describes 
  agriculture as adaptable and discusses adaptive responses. However, the capacity 
  to adapt varies significantly among regions and among groups of farmers within 
  regions. Adaptability and sustainability of agriculture and agroindustry depend 
  not only on resources such as favorable climate, water, soils, and amount of 
  land but also on the adaptability of whole market chains, which in turn are 
  influenced by wealth levels, technical and financial sophistication, and institutional 
  flexibility and strength (Tweeten, 1995; Nellis, 1996). </p>
<p>Changes in ocean conditions from El Niño episodes have demonstrated that changes 
  such as ocean warming have substantial impacts on the locations and types of 
  marine species available (UNEP, 1989; Meltzoff et al., 1997; Suman, 2001). Fishery-based 
  settlements would be strongly affected as fishermen follow high-valued stocks 
  to other locations, make do with lower valued stocks, or even abandon fishing 
  altogether (see <a href="283.htm">Chapters 6</a>, <a href="377.htm">10</a>, 
  <a href="516.htm">14</a>, <a href="545.htm">15</a>, and <a href="619.htm">17</a>). 
  Other communities may benefit if high-valued stocks become more accessible. 
</p>
<p>What often is not appreciated about resource-dependent settlements is the complexity 
  of the economic and social relationships among participants. Changes in the 
  technology of farming, transportation, and communications have integrated farming 
  communities into national and world markets as never before and increasingly 
  have made farming a part-time activity in some parts of the developed world 
  (e.g., Sakamoto, 1996; Sasaki, 1996) and the developing world. The complexity 
  of interactions and the increasing degree of integration offer additional means 
  of adaptation to climate change at the regional level, but these factors also 
  mean that agriculture and agroindustry are being challenged from several directions 
  at once, possibly complicating the impact of climate change alone (see, for 
  example, <a href="377.htm">Chapter 10</a>). </p>
<p>To illustrate some of the complexities involved, in Japan agrarian structures 
  have changed drastically during the past 30 years (Kumagai, 1996). Small farms 
  have evolved through cooperative groups facing environmental requirements, double-cropping, 
  cheaper imports, and high national economic growth (Sakamoto, 1996) into a regional 
  system of farm households, hamlets, traditional villages, villages, and towns 
  (Yoshino, 1997a,b), with significant part-time labor (Sasaki, 1996), and economics 
  of large-scale production in farming, reductions in investment risks costs, 
  diversification within farming, diversification between farming and other activities, 
  and increases in nonfarm income. </p>
<p>Japanese rice-growing illustrates some constraints on adaptation and community 
  sustainability. Inefficient agriculture (ironically) ties the younger generation 
  to the rural community, where they play important roles in making the community 
  active and viable. Provision of modern facilities and infrastructure does not 
  lead to sustainable communities; more important, one must consider residents' 
  pride or attachment to the community. Realization of a sustainable community 
  requires investments in time, talent, and money for the future of the community 
  (Tabayashi, 1996). Autonomous adaptation here, as elsewhere, might involve numerous 
  social and economic dimensions that involve the entire settlement. It is unlikely 
  to be simple or straightforward and may not result in sustaining every settlement. 
</p>
<h4><a name="72215"></a>7.2.2.1.5. Tourism and recreation </h4>
<p>The SAR noted that tourism-a major and growing industry in many regions-will 
  be affected by changes in precipitation patterns, severely affecting income-generating 
  activities (IPCC, 1998). The outcome in any particular area depends in part 
  on whether the tourist activity is summer- or winter-oriented and, for the latter, 
  the elevation of the area and the impact of climate on alternative activities 
  and destinations. For example, in spring 1997, when conditions in alternative 
  destinations in the Alps were poor, the number of skiers in the High Atlas in 
  Morrocco increased (Parish and Funnell, 1999). Scotland has been predicted to 
  have less snow cover at its lower elevation ski areas with global warming but 
  may have drier and warmer summers for hill-walking and other summer activities 
  (Harrison et al., 1999) (see regional chapters for other examples). </p>
<p>The impacts of sea-level rise on coastal tourism are compounded by the fact 
  that tourist facility development planning and execution in many cases has been 
  inadequate even for current conditions, leading to environmental problems such 
  as water shortages (Wong, 1998). Furthermore, tourism businesses, which usually 
  are location-specific, have a lower potential than tourists themselves (who 
  have a wide variety of options) to adapt to climate change (Wall, 1998). Small 
  island states may find themselves especially vulnerable to changes in the tourism 
  economy because of their often high economic dependence on tourism, concentration 
  of assets and infrastructure in the coastal zone, and often poor resident population 
  (see <a href="619.htm">Chapter 17</a>). </p>
<p>Whetton et al. (1996) quantified the effects of climate change on snow cover 
  in the Australian Alps, which illustrates the problems of snow-based recreation 
  activities. Under the best-case scenario for 2030, simulated average snow-cover 
  duration and the frequency of more than 60 days cover annually decline at all 
  sites considered. However, this effect is not very marked at higher sites (above 
  1,700 m). For the worst-case scenario, at higher sites, simulated average snow 
  cover roughly halves by 2030 and approaches zero by 2070. At lower sites, near-zero 
  average values are simulated by 2030. </p>
<h4><a name="7222"></a>7.2.2.2. Riverine, Coastal, and Steeplands Settlements-Impacts 
  on Infrastructure </h4>
<p>Riverine and coastal settlements are notable largely for the potential that 
  flooding and especially sea-level rise can have on them; steeplands in many 
  regions are expected to become more vulnerable to landslides. The mechanisms 
  of these effects depend on the settlement being located in harm's way. River 
  floods can arise from intense local rainfall events or rapid snowmelt, for which 
  long-term probabilities are difficult to forecast (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>; Georgakakos et al., 1998). Rapid snowmelt from rain-on-snow events or 
  warm periods in the middle of winter is a potential threat in a warmer world 
  in some heavily settled, snow-fed river systems such as the Rhine in Europe 
  (see <a href="491.htm">Chapter 13</a>), whereas steeplands may suffer more landslides 
  and snow avalanches (e.g., Evans and Clague, 1997). The mechanisms of adaptation 
  are similar: defend against flooding or landslides with increasingly expensive 
  protection structures; retreat from the floodplain and unstable areas to safe 
  ground; or accommodate flooding and landslides in structure design, land-use 
  planning, and evacuation plans (see also <a href="347.htm">Chapters 9</a>, <a href="377.htm">10</a>, 
  <a href="411.htm">11</a>, <a href="463.htm">12</a>, <a href="491.htm">13</a>, 
  <a href="545.htm">15</a>, and <a href="619.htm">17</a>). </p>
<p>The most widespread serious potential impact of climate change on human settlements 
  is believed to be flooding. A growing literature suggests that a very wide variety 
  of settlements in nearly every climate zone may be affected, although specific 
  evidence is still very limited. Riverine and coastal settlements are believed 
  to be particularly at risk, but urban flooding could be a problem anywhere storm 
  drains, water supply, and waste management systems are not designed with enough 
  system capacity or sophistication to avoid being overwhelmed. Urbanization itself 
  explains much of the increase in runoff relative to precipitation in settled 
  areas (Changnon and Demissie, 1996) and contributes to flood-prone situations. 
</p>
<p>In coastal regions (especially on river deltas and small islands), sea-level 
  rise will be the most fundamental challenge of global warming that human settlements 
  face. Some additional national and regional analyses of coastal vulnerability 
  to sea-level rise have been published since the SAR. Many of these studies are 
  summarized in <a href="283.htm">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="321.htm">8</a> because 
  of the importance of the issue to these sectors. In general, estimates of potential 
  damages continue to increase because of increased movement of people and property 
  into the coastal zone, even though the expected degree of sea-level rise has 
  decreased. Worldwide, depending on the degree of adaptive response, the number 
  of people at risk from annual flooding as a result of a 40-cm sea-level rise 
  and population increase in the coastal zone is expected to increase from today's 
  level of 10 million to 22-29 million by the 2020s, 50-80 million by 2050s, and 
  88-241 million by the 2080s (Nicholls et al., 1999). Without sea-level rise, 
  the numbers were projected at 22-23 million in the 2020s, 27-32 million in the 
  2050s, and 13-36 million in the 2080s. The 40-cm sea-level rise is consistent 
  with the middle of the range currently being projected for 2100 by Working Group 
  I. In 2050, more than 70% (90% by the 2080s) of people in settlements that potentially 
  would be flooded by sea-level rise are likely to be located in a few regions: 
  west Africa, east Africa, the southern Mediterranean, south Asia, and southeast 
  Asia. In terms of relative increase, however, some of the biggest impacts are 
  in the small island states (Nicholls et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Although a 1-m sea-level rise is not considered likely before 2100, it often 
  is used to calibrate many damage estimates. For example, a macroscopic analysis 
  of coastal vulnerability, areas, population, and amount of assets at risk from 
  sea-level rise and storm surges for Japan shows about 861 km2 of land currently 
  is below the high-water level, with 2 million people and 54 trillion Japanese 
  yen in assets. A 1-m sea-level rise would expand the area at risk 2.7 times, 
  to 2,339 km2, and increase population and assets at risk to 4.1 million and 
  109 trillion Japanese yen, respectively (Mimura et al., 1998). El-Raey (1997) 
  identifies potential impacts on Egypt: 2 million persons and 214,000 jobs affected, 
  US$35 billion in land value, property, and tourism income lost for a 50-cm sea-level 
  rise. For a 100-cm rise, Zeidler (1997) identifies potential land losses of 
  US$30 billion, plus US$18 billion at risk of flooding and as much as US$6 billion 
  of "full protection" in Poland. (See also Nicholls et al., 1999, for potential 
  damages to settlements on the world's coasts; Adger, 1999, specifically for 
  damages to human settlements in Vietnam; Weerakkody, 1997, for Sri Lanka; and 
  Liu, 1997, for China.) </p>
<p>If sea-level changes occur slowly, economically rational decisions could be 
  made to protect only property that is worth more than its protection costs. 
  With foresight, settlements can be planned to avoid much of the potential cost 
  of protection, given that between 50 and 100 years are expected to pass before 
  a 1-m sea-level rise would be expected. Yohe and Neumann (1997) offer a method 
  by which this planning might be applied. This method can reduce the costs of 
  protection by more than an order of magnitude. Yohe et al. (1996) estimate discounted 
  (at 3% yr<sup>-1</sup>) cumulative U.S. national protection costs plus property 
  abandonment costs for a 1-m sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century at 
  US$5-6 billion, as opposed to previous estimates of $73-111 billion (Smith and 
  Tirpak, 1989). Sea-level rise exacerbates beach erosion, changes sedimentation 
  patterns, increases river floors in estaurine zones, and inundates wetlands 
  and tidal flats. Groundwater salinization also is a serious problem in coastal 
  zones and many small islands, where recharge does not keep up with usage even 
  under current conditions (Liu, 1997). Higher sea levels are projected to further 
  reduce the size of coastal fresh aquifers and exacerbate the problem. Directly, 
  it causes drinking water quality problems for people in settlements; indirectly, 
  it may limit agriculture in coastal zones (e.g., Dakar, Senegal-Timmerman and 
  White, 1997). Groundwater pumping makes matters worse in many coastal zones 
  by contributing to serious land subsidence. Examples of human settlements affected 
  range from modern European cities (Venice) to large coastal settlements in developing 
  countries (Alexandria, Tianjin, Jakarta, and Bangkok) (Timmerman and White, 
  1997; Nicholls et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Vulnerabilities of settlements in coastal regions to higher sea levels are 
  compounded by severe wind damage and storm surge caused by tropical cyclones 
  and extra-tropical cyclones. The possibility of increasingly frequent (in some 
  regions) or more intense tropical cyclones also cannot be rejected (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>). Even if cyclones do not increase in intensity or frequency, with sea-level 
  rise they would be expected to be an increasingly severe problem in low-lying 
  coastal regions (e.g., for settlements along the North Sea coast in northwest 
  Europe, the Seychelles, parts of Micronesia, the Gulf Coast of the United States 
  and Mexico, the Nile Delta, the Gulf of Guinea, and the Bay of Bengal-specific 
  vulnerable regions are identified in the FAR, SAR, RICC, and regional chapters 
  of this report). Infrastructure hardening costs can be high if a decision were 
  made to protect everything: The costs of protecting port facilities and coastal 
  structures, raising wharves and quays, and reconstructing water gates and pumping 
  stations for a 1-m sea-level rise in 39 prefectures in Japan has been estimated 
  at 22 trillion Japanese yen (US$194 billion), or about 7% of annual GDP (Mimura 
  and Harasawa, 2000). In cases in which neither retreat nor defense is feasible, 
  flooding can be accommodated through infrastructure that is designed to reduce 
  damage and evacuation planning to reduce loss of life. Bangladesh, for example, 
  provides hardened storm shelters (Choudhury, 1998). </p>
<p>When extreme weather disasters happen in these regions as a result of tropical 
  or extra-tropical cyclones, the total costs of damages become very large and, 
  where insured, often cause serious problems for insurance carriers (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>). The United States' direct annual insured and uninsured costs for tropical 
  cyclones (hurricanes), adjusting for inflation, averaged $1.6 billion (1995 
  US$) from 1950 to 1989 and $6.2 billion from 1989 to 1995 (Hebert et al., 1996). 
  Estimates of worldwide annual direct costs have been placed at $10-15 billion 
  annually (Pielke, 1997). Increased losses in the United States and elsewhere 
  have occurred during a period in which the number and intensity of tropical 
  cyclones actually was declining (Landsea et al., 1996; Pielke and Landsea, 1998). 
  Thus, any future climate change-induced increase in tropical cyclone frequency 
  or intensity remains a matter of great concern to insurers and coastal facilities 
  planners. A single US$50 billion storm is not considered unlikely (Pielke and 
  Landsea, 1998).</p>
