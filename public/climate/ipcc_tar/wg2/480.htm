<h3>12.6.2. Investment and Insurance </h3>
<p>According to Pittock <i>et al.</i> (1999), based on Insurance Council of Australia 
  figures, major climatic catastrophe insurance losses from 1970 through 1996 
  averaged AU$208 million yr<sup>-1</sup>. Of these losses, nearly half were from tropical 
  cyclones; one-quarter were from hail. Other flooding and storm damage accounted 
  for most of the rest; losses from fire were less than 10% of the total. Figures 
  provided by the Insurance Council of New Zealand show that insurance industry 
  payouts for New Zealand climatic catastrophes averaged NZ$23.5 million yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (inflation-adjusted) between 1980 and 1998.</p>
<p>In an Australian study of insurance and climate change, Leigh <i>et al.</i> (1998a) 
  examined four major climatic disasters: the Brisbane floods of 1974, the South 
  Australian bushfires of 1983, the Nyngan floods of 1990, and the New South Wales 
  bushfires of 1994. Total estimated damage from these four events was AU$178 
  million, $200-400 million, $47 million, and $168 million, respectively; 
  however, the insurance industry bore only 39, 31, 9, and 33% of the cost, respectively. 
  Government relief assistance was roughly equal to that from the insurance industry, 
  and about 70-90% of that was provided by the federal government. </p>
<p>Leigh <i>et al.</i> (1998b) have reported on the potential for adaptation to climate 
  change by the insurance industry in Australia by setting out an array of reactive 
  and proactive options. Responses include reducing insurers' exposure or 
  controlling claims through risk management to encourage disaster mitigation 
  measures. The latter has the advantage of reducing overall losses to the community, 
  rather than merely redistributing them among stakeholders. Natural disaster 
  insurance can be more selective, so that good risks are rewarded and poor risks 
  are penalized. Such rate-based incentives can motivate stakeholders to plan 
  to more effectively minimize exposure to disasters. However, some individuals 
  and businesses may have difficulties if some previously insurable properties 
  become uninsurable against flood because of an increase in location-specific 
  flood frequency. Government intervention and possible co-insurance between government 
  and insurers also were canvassed. Cooperation between insurers and governments 
  to ensure development and enforcement of more appropriate building codes and 
  zoning regulations was regarded as desirable.</p>

<h3>12.6.3. Energy and Minerals</h3>
<p>Energy demand, essentially for air conditioning, is likely to increase in the 
  summer and in more tropical parts of Australia and New Zealand (Lowe, 1988). 
  However, winter demand for heating will similarly decrease in the winter and 
  in cooler areas. Thus, increasing population in tropical and subtropical parts 
  of Australia may combine with climate change to increase overall energy demand.</p>
<p>The other major uses of energy in Australia are transport and manufacturing. 
  Transport demand generally will increase because of population growth but may 
  be significantly affected by the changing distribution of growth across the 
  continent, which in turn may be affected by climate change.</p>
<p>In general, warming will slightly reduce energy efficiency in most manufacturing, 
  including electricity generation, but this is relatively minor compared with 
  possible technological improvements in efficiency. Any decrease in water supply 
  (see <a href="470.htm#1231">Section 12.3.1</a>), such as is expected in the 
  Murray-Darling basin in Australia, would impact adversely on hydroelectric generation 
  and cooling of power stations, especially where there already is competition 
  between water uses. Fitzharris and Garr (1996) predict benefits for hydroelectricity 
  schemes in New Zealand's Southern Alps because they expect less water will be 
  trapped as snow in the winter, which is the time of peak energy demand for heating.</p>

<h3>12.6.4. Coastal Development and Management, Tourism</h3>
<p>Economic development is proceeding rapidly in many coastal and tropical areas 
  of Australia and New Zealand. This is fueled partly by general economic and 
  population growth, but it is amplified in these regions by resource availability, 
  shipping access for exports, attractive climates and landscapes, and the growth 
  of the tourism industry. This selective growth in investment is leading to greater 
  community risk and insurance exposure to present and future hazards, while many 
  classes of hazard are expected to increase with global warming (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>). Thus, present development trends are likely to make the impacts of 
  climate change worse, especially for sea-level rise and increasing intensity 
  of tropical cyclones. Particular attention should be paid to the implications 
  for the risk to life and property of developments in coastal regions, as well 
  as ways to reduce vulnerability to these hazards. Possible adaptations include 
  improved design standards, zoning, early warning systems, evacuation plans, 
  and emergency services.</p>
<p>Management of waste and pollution from settlements and industry will become 
  more critical because of the potential for flood and waste discharge to impinge 
  on water quality, including inland and coastal algal blooms, as well as adverse 
  effects on ecotourism associated with damage to coral reefs (see <a href="473.htm#1247">Section 
  12.4.7</a>). Sediment and pollution fluxes into the GBR lagoon already are a 
  major concern (Larcombe <i>et al.</i>, 1996). This could be exacerbated by greater 
  flood flows (see <a href="468.htm#12153">Sections 12.1.5.3</a> and <a href="479.htm#1261">12.6.1</a>) 
  and increasing population and development. Higher temperatures will accentuate 
  algal blooms. </p>
<p>The other major tourism and recreation sector that is likely to be seriously 
  affected by climate change is the ski industry, which will be faced with significant 
  reductions in natural snow cover (see <a href="469.htm#122">Sections 12.2</a> 
  and <a href="472.htm#1244">12.4.4</a>) and limited acceptance of artificial 
  snow (Konig, 1998). Also, as the potential ranges of certain agricultural pests 
  such as the fruit fly (see <a href="477.htm#1257">Section 12.5.7</a>) and disease 
  vectors such as mosquitos (see <a href="481.htm#1271">Section 12.7.1</a>) increase, 
  possible transfer of such pests and diseases through tourism may become an increasing 
  issue.</p>

<h3>12.6.5. Risk Management</h3>
<p>As a result of the large uncertainties associated with possible future climate, 
  as well as the stochastic nature of extreme events, there is great need for 
  a risk management approach to development planning and engineering standards. 
  In accordance with the precautionary principle, uncertainty should not be allowed 
  to stand in the way of risk reduction measures, which in any case often will 
  have other benefits such as protection of coastal and riverine environments.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have jointly developed a risk management standard 
  (Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand, 1999) that is designed to provide 
  a consistent vocabulary and assist risk managers by delineating risk management 
  as a four-step process that involves risk identification, risk analysis, risk 
  evaluation, and risk treatment. Beer and Ziolkowski (1995) specifically examined 
  environmental risk management and produced a risk management framework.</p>
<p>Examples of the application of a risk analysis approach are given in <a href="474.htm#1252">Sections 
  12.5.2</a> for pastures in New Zealand, <a href="479.htm#1261">12.6.1</a> for 
  storm surges, and <a href="485.htm#1284">12.8.4</a> for irrigation water demand.</p>
