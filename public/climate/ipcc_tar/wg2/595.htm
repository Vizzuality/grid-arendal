<h2>16.1. Polar Regions </h2>
<p>For the purposes of this assessment, the Arctic is defined as the area within 
  the Arctic Circle. It covers the Arctic Ocean and the islands and northern continental 
  land areas (see <a href="596.htm#fig161">Figure 16-1</a>). Thus, it extends 
  far enough south to include parts of the boreal forest and discontinuous permafrost 
  zone. Note that the Arctic, thus defined, overlaps with other regions covered 
  in this report&#151;namely, North America, Asia, and Europe&#151;and that important 
  physical and biological processes that are typical of the Arctic also occur 
  south of the Arctic Circle. The Antarctic is defined here as the Antarctic continent, 
  together with the surrounding Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Convergence 
  (polar front), an oceanographic barrier that shifts with time and longitude 
  but generally is close to 58&deg;S. Also included in the polar regions are sub-Antarctic 
  islands such as Campbell Island, Heard Island, and South Georgia, some of which 
  are north of the Antarctic Convergence (see <a href="597.htm#fig162">Figure 
  16-2</a>).</p>
<p>The two polar regions are dominated by cold conditions and the presence of 
  ice, snow, and water. They are different in that the Arctic is a frozen ocean 
  surrounded by continental landmasses and open oceans, whereas Antarctica is 
  a frozen continent surrounded solely by oceans. Antarctica tends to be thermally 
  isolated from the rest of the planet by the surrounding Southern Ocean and the 
  atmospheric polar vortex, whereas the Arctic is influenced strongly by seasonal 
  atmospheric transport and river flows from surrounding continents. Both regions 
  have major influences on the global ocean.</p>
<p>The Arctic and Antarctic influence climate over a significant part of the globe. 
  Many unique climatic processes operate in these regions. Some involve complex 
  interactions and feedback loops (Simmonds, 1998) that may lead ultimately to 
  glacial-interglacial climate transitions (Petit <i>et al</i>., 1999). Processes in 
  polar regions greatly influence sea level. The Arctic and Antarctic have food 
  webs and natural ecosystems with remarkable productivity. The Arctic is on the 
  periphery of human settlement, where people must adapt to harsh, cold regimes; 
  the Antarctic is uninhabited apart from research bases.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="1611"></a>16.1.1. Previous Work&#151;Summary of Special Report on 
  Regional Impacts of Climate Change </h3>
<p>The IPCC, in its Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (RICC), 
  produced an assessment of the impacts of climate change on the Arctic and the 
  Antarctic (Everett and Fitzharris, 1998). In addition, the impact of climate 
  change on the cryosphere is discussed in the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) 
  (Fitzharris, 1996). The main points arising from the regional assessment were 
  that the Arctic is extremely vulnerable to projected climate change&#151;major 
  physical, ecological, sociological, and economic impacts are expected. Because 
  of a variety of positive feedback mechanisms, the Arctic is likely to respond 
  rapidly and more severely than any other area on Earth, with consequent effects 
  on sea ice, permafrost, and hydrology. On the other hand, the Antarctic would 
  respond relatively slowly to climate change, with much smaller impacts expected 
  by 2100, except in the Antarctic Peninsula.<br>
</p>
<p>RICC noted that substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean would have 
  major implications for trade and defense (Everett and Fitzharris, 1998) . With 
  more open water, there would be moderation of temperatures and increased precipitation. 
  Considerable thawing of permafrost would lead to changes in drainage, increased 
  slumping, and altered landscapes over vast areas of northern parts of North 
  America and Eurasia. RICC also purported that polar warming probably should 
  increase biological production, but different species compositions are likely 
  on land and in the sea, with a tendency for poleward shifts in major biomes 
  and associated animals. Animals that are dependent on ice would be disadvantaged. 
  Human communities in the Arctic&#151;especially indigenous peoples following 
  traditional lifestyles&#151;would be affected by these changes.<br>
</p>
<p>RICC also pointed out that changes in polar climate are likely to affect other 
  parts of the world through changes in sea level, decreased oceanic heat transport, 
  and increased emissions of GHGs from thawing permafrost. However, there would 
  be economic benefits as well as costs. Potential benefits include new opportunities 
  for shipping across the Arctic Ocean, lower operational costs for the oil and 
  gas industry, lower heating costs, and easier access for tourism. Increased 
  costs could be expected from changes such as disruptions to land and infrastructure 
  caused by thawing of permafrost and reduced transportation capabilities across 
  frozen ground and water.<br>
</p>
<p>Since these IPCC reports, there have been important advances in knowledge about 
  climate change in polar regions. These advances include more information about 
  decreases in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent, verification of substantial 
  thinning of Arctic sea ice, documentation of important changes in polar oceans, 
  and more analyses of continental snow-cover trends. Many observations of environmental 
  change in the Arctic show a trend that is consistent with GHG warming and similar 
  to that predicted by climate models. <br>
</p>
<p>This report is different from earlier IPCC reports in that it focuses on eight 
  key concerns of climate impact. The risk of collapse of the West Antarctic ice 
  sheet is now considered to be lower than first thought. Changes around the Antarctic 
  Peninsula are given prominence, and the implications for the whole continent 
  are discussed in more detail. Previous reports said little about the impacts 
  on polar oceans and consequences for marine life. New information, especially 
  for the Southern Ocean and its role in the global thermohaline circulation, 
  is presented here. There also are improved predictions of sea ice over the 21st 
  century, and the role of Arctic hydrology and the implications of altered river 
  flows into the Arctic Ocean for the Atlantic driver of the thermohaline circulation 
  are addressed. More information is now available regarding the impacts of climate 
  change on Arctic biota. More detail is supplied about impacts on human communities, 
  especially indigenous peoples following traditional lifestyles. This research 
  has highlighted the role of climate change in the Arctic and Antarctic and its 
  impact on polar drivers of the global system. New modeling has identified the 
  large role of polar regions in affecting the global thermohaline circulation, 
  sea-level rise, and greenhouse exchanges between the atmosphere, cold oceans, 
  and tundra. It is now clearer that climate change could initiate processes that 
  could last for millennia and persist long after greenhouse emissions have stabilized.</p>
