<h3>9.7.3. Other Mosquito-Borne Viruses</h3>
<p>Mosquitoes transmit many viruses, more than 100 of which are known to infect 
  humans&#151;causing illness ranging from acute viral syndrome to severe and 
  sometimes fatal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. The natural transmission 
  cycles of these viruses are complex and usually involve birds or rodents as 
  well as several mosquito species; each region of the world has its own unique 
  viruses (Gubler and Roehrig, 1998). These viruses have become important global 
  emergent/resurgent public health problems in recent years, causing widespread 
  epidemics (Gubler 1996, 1998a).</p>
<p>Yellow fever&#151;a virus that occurs naturally in the rain forests of Africa 
  and South America in an enzootic cycle involving lower primates and mosquitoes&#151;also 
  can cause major urban epidemics in a cycle involving Aedes aegypti that is identical 
  to dengue (Monath, 1988). As such, it has similar weather and climate sensitivity 
  to dengue. Yellow fever was effectively controlled in the 1950s and 1960s through 
  vaccination (Africa) and mosquito control (the Americas). With reinvasion of 
  most large American tropical urban centers by Aedes aegypti in the past 30 years 
  (Gubler, 1989), the region is at its highest risk for urban epidemics in 50 
  years (Gubler, 1998c). Once urban epidemics of yellow fever begin to occur in 
  tropical America, it is expected that this virus will move very quickly via 
  modern transportation to Asia and the Pacific, where it has never occurred (Gubler, 
  1998c).</p>
<p>Several mosquito-borne viruses cause encephalitis, including eastern equine 
  encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), St. Louis encephalitis 
  (SLE), La Crosse encephalitis (LAC), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) 
  in the Americas; Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Asia; Murray Valley encephalitis 
  (MVE) and Kuniin (KUN) in Australia; and West Nile (WN) and Rift Valley fever 
  (RVF) viruses in Africa (Gubler and Roehrig 1998). WN virus also occurs in west 
  and central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe and recently was introduced into 
  the United States, where it caused a major epidemic in New York City (Asnis 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Komar, 2000). All of these viruses have birds (EEE, WEE, SLE, 
  JE, MVE, KUN, WN) or rodents (LAC, VEE) as natural reservoir hosts. The natural 
  host for RVF is not known, but large ungulates act as amplifying hosts.<br>
</p>
<p>Epidemics of these diseases occur when their natural ecology is disturbed in 
  some way (Gubler and Roehrig, 1998). This could include environmental changes 
  such as meteorological changes or forest clearing, changes in population densities 
  and structure of the mosquito or vertebrate host, or genetic changes in the 
  viruses. All of these diseases are very climate-sensitive, but it is difficult 
  to know how climate change will influence their distribution and incidence because 
  of the complexities of their transmission cycles in nature. For example, in 
  the United States, WEE and SLE could expand their geographic distribution northward, 
  and WEE could disappear from most of the country (Reeves <i>et al</i>., 1994). Climate 
  change also may have an effect on endemic/enzootic arboviruses in Australia 
  (Russell, 1998; Tong <i>et al</i>., 1998; Bi <i>et al</i>., 2000). Thus, there probably would 
  be positive and negative impacts, depending on the disease.<br>
</p>
<p>Floods may cause an immediate decrease in mosquito populations because of loss 
  of breeding sites. However, disease risk may rise as floodwaters recede and 
  vector populations increase, but only if the virus is present (Nasci and Moore, 
  1998). This underscores the need to have effective surveillance systems and 
  prevention strategies in place to monitor disease and control vector activity, 
  as well as the need for more research on the transmission dynamics of vector-borne 
  diseases.</p>
<h3><a name="974"></a>9.7.4. Leishmaniasis </h3>
<p>There are two principal clinical types of leishmaniasis&#151;visceral and cutaneous&#151;which 
  is caused by a range of species of Leishmania parasites. The parasites are transmitted 
  by sandflies, of which the two most important genera are Phlebotomus in Europe 
  and Asia and Lutzomyia in the Americas. In central Asia and Europe, leishmaniasis 
  has become an important co-infection with human imunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
  (Alvar <i>et al</i>., 1997; WHO/UNAIDS, 1998). Sandflies are very sensitive 
  to temperature, and increases in temperature also may increase daily mortality 
  rates. Phlebotominae are sensitive to sudden temperature changes and prefer 
  regions with small differences between maximum and minimum temperatures. Thomson 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) mapped P. orientalis in Sudan and found that the geographic 
  distribution was best explained by mean annual maximum daily temperature and 
  soil type. One study on leishmaniasis in Italy indicates that climate change 
  may expand the range of one vector (P. perniciosus) but decrease the range of 
  another (P. perfiliewi) (Kuhn, 1997). A 3&deg;C increase in temperature could 
  increase the geographic and seasonal distribution of P. papatasi in southwest 
  Asia, provided other ecological requirements are met (Cross and Hyams, 1996; 
  Cross <i>et al</i>., 1996). </p>
<p>The southern limit of leishmaniasis and vectors in South America is the extreme 
  north of Argentina (Curto de Cassas and Carcavallo, 1995; Marcondes <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). There have been no systematic studies of the relationship between climate 
  parameters and vectors or human cases in the Americas. Climate change could 
  affect the geographical distribution of these vector species in Brazil, Paraguay, 
  Bolivia, and Argentina (Carcavallo and Curto de Casas, 1996).</p>
