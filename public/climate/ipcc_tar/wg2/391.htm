<h4>10.2.2.4. Livestock </h4>
<p>Other than pigs, domestic livestock in Africa are concentrated in the arid 
  and semi-arid zones. This is because the more humid areas were historically 
  prone to livestock diseases such as <i>nagana </i>(a trypanosome carried by 
  the tsetse fly&#151;Ford and Katondo, 1977), typically support grasses of low 
  digestibility (Scholes, 1990, 1993), and often are densely settled by crop agriculturalists. 
  The overwhelming majority of these animals feed predominantly off natural grasslands 
  and savannas, although crop residues are an important supplement during the 
  dry season. Many urban and rural families also keep poultry.</p>
<p>Domestic livestock play a central role in many African cultures. Cattle and 
  camels, in particular, have an importance that goes beyond the production of 
  meat. Their value is based on the full set of services they supply (milk, meat, 
  blood, hides, draft power), their asset value as a form of savings, and their 
  cultural symbolism. It would be difficult and damaging for these cultures to 
  abandon pastoralism in the event that it becomes climatically, environmentally, 
  or economically unviable. </p>
<p>Although classical concepts of animal carrying capacity may not be very useful 
  as local management tools in the context of African semi-arid systems with high 
  interannual variability (Behnke<i> et al.,</i> 1993), they remain valid as indicators 
  of animal production when they are applied over decadal periods and large areas. 
  Many researchers have demonstrated a strong link between long-term, large-area 
  herbivore biomass (LHB, kg km<sup>-2</sup>) in African wildlife and pastoral 
  systems and mean annual precipitatiation at one site (see also Le Houerou, 1998, 
  for a similar analysis in west Africa and the Mediterranean basin). Thus, in 
  broad terms, changes in range-fed livestock numbers in any African region will 
  be directly proportional to changes in annual precipitation. Given that several 
  GCMs predict a decrease in MAP on the order of 10-20% in the main semi-arid 
  zones of Africa, there is a real possibility that climate change will have a 
  negative impact on pastoral livelihoods. The following additional factors must 
  be considered.</p>
<p>The causal chain between rainfall and animal numbers passes through grass production, 
  which also is approximately linearly related to rainfall (Breman, 1975; Le Houerou 
  and Hoste, 1977; Rutherford, 1995). The slope of this relationship, which can 
  be expressed as WUE, is a function of soil nutrient availability (De Ridder 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1982; Scholes, 1993). WUE also is a function of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration in the atmosphere (Mooney <i>et al.,</i> 1999), especially in 
  semi-arid regions. Because the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration will rise in the 
  future, its positive impact on WUE (which is on the order of 20-30% for 
  doubled CO<sub>2</sub>, even in C<sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands such as these) 
  will help to offset reduction in rainfall of the same magnitude. Simulations 
  of grassland production in southern Africa indicate an almost exact balancing 
  of these two effects for that region (Scholes <i>et al.,</i> 2000). </p>
<p>About 80% of the grazing lands of Africa are in savannas, a vegetation formation 
  that consists of a mix of trees and grasses. Grass production in savannas is 
  strongly depressed by tree cover (see the many references reviewed by Scholes 
  and Archer, 1997). Because domestic livestock, with the exception of goats, 
  predominantly eat the grass in these systems, future changes in tree cover are 
  an important issue from the point of view of carbon sequestration and livestock 
  production. Tree biomass ultimately is related to climate and soil type, but 
  the mechanism appears to be via fire frequency and intensity. If fire frequency 
  and intensity were to decrease&#151;as a result of climate changes (for instance, 
  an increase in dry-season rainfall) or, more likely, changes in land management&#151;woody 
  cover would increase. This has been demonstrated in numerous fire experiments 
  in Africa (Trapnell <i>et al.</i>, 1976; Booysen and Tainton, 1984). Given the 
  vast area of the savannas, the carbon sequestration potential is substantial 
  (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996). In addition, emissions of tropospheric ozone 
  (O<sub>3</sub>) precursors would decrease if savanna burning were reduced. The 
  disadvantage would be a more than proportional decrease in livestock carrying 
  capacity, as a result of the nonlinear suppressive effect of trees on grass 
  production.</p>
<p>The bioclimatic limit of savannas in southern Africa is related to winter temperatures. 
  An increase in temperature of 1-2&deg;C&#151;well within the range predicted 
  for next century&#151;would make the montane grasslands (highveld) of southern 
  Africa susceptible to invasion by savanna trees (Ellery <i>et al.,</i> 1990).</p>
<p>In moister regions, animal productivity is limited not by the gross availability 
  of fodder but by its protein (nitrogen) content (Ellery <i>et al.,</i> 1996). 
  Increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration or the rainfall will not increase 
  the protein availability; thus, livestock in these regions are likely to be 
  less responsive to the direct effects of atmospheric and climate change. Under 
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of forage will decrease, 
  but this will not necessarily lead to decreased forage palatability despite 
  the dilution of protein (Mooney <i>et al.</i>, 1999). This may be because in 
  grasses, the bulk of the excess carbon is stored in the form of starch, which 
  is readily digestible. Widespread use of protein and micronutrient feed supplements 
  and new technology for the control of veterinary diseases will have a greater 
  impact on livestock numbers and productivity, especially in the "miombo" 
  region of south central Africa.</p>
<p>Domestic livestock, like other animals, have a climate envelope in which they 
  perform optimally. The limits of the envelope are quite broad and can be extended 
  by selecting for heat or cold tolerance, feed supplementation, or providing 
  physical shelter for the animals. African cattle are mostly from the Bos indicus 
  line, which is more heat-tolerant than the European line of Bos taurus. In extremely 
  hot areas (mean daily warm-season temperatures greater than body temperature), 
  even the Bos indicus breeds are beyond their thermal optimum (Robertshaw and 
  Finch, 1976). Meat and milk production declines, largely because the animals 
  remain in the shade instead of foraging. There is limited potential for extending 
  this limit through breeding. Adaptation would require substitution by a species 
  such as the oryx, which is physiologically equipped for high temperatures and 
  low water supply.</p>
<p>In the higher altitude and higher latitude regions of Africa, livestock (typically 
  sheep) currently are exposed to winter temperatures below their optimum. Mortality 
  often results when cold periods coincide with wet periods, if the animals have 
  not been herded to shelter. These episodes are likely to decrease in frequency 
  and extent in the future.</p>
<p>Livestock distribution and productivity could be indirectly influenced via 
  changes in the distribution of vector-borne livestock diseases, such as nagana 
  (trypanosomiasis) and the tick-borne East Coast Fever and Corridor Disease (Hulme, 
  1996). Simulations of changes in the distribution of tsetse fly (Glossina spp.) 
  indicate that with warming it could extend its range southward in Zimbabwe and 
  Mozambique, westward in Angola, and northeast in Tanzania, although in all these 
  simulations there were substantial reductions in the prevalence of tsetse in 
  some current areas of distribution. The tick Riphicephalus appendiculatus was 
  predicted to decrease its range in southern and eastern Africa and increase 
  its range in the central and western part of southern Africa (Hulme, 1996). 
</p>
<p>One land-use model (IMAGE 2.0&#151;Alcamo, 1994) projects that large parts 
  of Africa will be transformed to pastoral systems during the 21st century. The 
  model logic that leads to this conclusion is that increasing urbanization and 
  a rising standard of living typically are associated with a change in dietary 
  preference toward meat. The area that currently is used for meat production 
  therefore would need to expand, assuming that meat demand was not met by import 
  or by increased productivity of existing herds. These are reasonable but untested 
  assumptions, and their consequences have major implications for biodiversity 
  conservation and atmospheric composition. The areas indicated as being converted 
  to pastures (largely the subhumid tropics) already support cattle to some degree. 
  Increased cattle production would require widespread tree clearing (leading 
  to conversion of a carbon sink into a carbon source), eradication of key cattle 
  diseases, and the use of protein and micronutrient feed supplements. The quantity 
  of fuel consumed by savanna fires would decrease (because it would be grazed), 
  reducing the release of pyrogenic methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> 
  precursors, but the production of methane from enteric fermentation would increase. 
  Because methane production per unit of grass consumed is higher for enteric 
  fermentation than for savanna fires (Scholes <i>et al.,</i> 1996), the result 
  is likely to be a net increase in radiative forcing.</p>
<h4><a name="10225"></a>10.2.2.5. Impacts of Drought and Floods</h4>
<p>Food security in Africa already is affected by extreme events, particularly 
  droughts and floods (e.g., Kadomura, 1994; Scoones <i>et al.,</i> 1996). The 
  ENSO floods in 1998 in east Africa resulted in human suffering and deaths, as 
  well as extensive damage to infrastructure and crops in Kenya (Magadza, 2000). 
  Floods in Mozambique in 2000 and in Kenya in 1997-1998 sparked major emergency 
  relief as hundreds of people lost their lives and thousands were displaced from 
  their homes (Brickett <i>et al., </i>1999; Ngecu and Mathu, 1999; see also &lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.reliefweb.int">www.reliefweb.int</a>&gt;). 
  The cost in Kenya alone was estimated at US$1 billion (Ngecu and Mathu, 1999). 
  Droughts in 1991-1992 and 1997-1998 affected livelihoods and economies 
  and heightened renewed interest in the impacts of climatic hazards (e.g., Kadomura, 
  1994; Campbell, 1999). For example, the impacts of the 1991-1992 drought 
  in Zimbabwe are estimated to have been 9% of GDP (Benson and Clay, 1998).</p>
<p>Such climatic episodes can serve as an analog of climate change. Irrespective 
  of whether climate change will cause more frequent or more intense extreme events, 
  it is apparent that many aspects of African economies are still sensitive to 
  climatic hazards. At the local level, some coping strategies are less reliable 
  (Jallow, 1995)&#151;for instance, Campbell (1999) notes that plants and trees 
  used as food by pastoralists in southern Kenya declined between 1986 and 1996. 
  National governments often struggle to provide food security during times of 
  crisis (Ayalew, 1997; Gundry <i>et al., </i>1999). For national and international 
  agencies, the cost of climatic hazards&#151;impacts, recovery, and rehabilitation&#151;may 
  result in a shift in expenditure from reducing vulnerability to simply coping 
  with immediate threats (e.g., Dilley and Heyman, 1995).</p>
