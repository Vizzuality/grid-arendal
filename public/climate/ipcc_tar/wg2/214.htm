<p><a name="fig52"></a>The agriculture sector historically has shown enormous 
  capacity to adjust to social and environmental stimuli that are analogous to 
  climate stimuli. Historical analogs of the adaptability of agriculture to climate 
  change include experience with historical climate fluctuations, deliberate translocation 
  of crops across different agroclimatic zones, rapid substitution of new crops 
  for old ones, and resource substitutions induced by scarcity (Easterling, 1996). 
  In the Argentine Pampas, the proportion of land allocated to crops has increased 
  markedly at the expense of grazing land during historic humid periods, and vice 
  versa during dry periods (Viglizzo <i>et al</i>., 1997). Historical expansion 
  of hard red winter wheat across thermal and moisture gradients of the U.S. Great 
  Plains provides an example of crop translocation (Rosenberg, 1982). At present, 
  the northern boundary of winter wheat in China is just south of the Great Wall 
  and the north edge of China, where large temperature increases are expected 
  under climate change (Lin, 1997). Winter wheat planting has shifted from Dalian 
  (38&ordm;54'N) to Shenyang (41&ordm;46'N) in Liaoning province. The 
  shift was aided by introduction of freeze-resistant winter wheat varieties from 
  high-latitude countries such as Russia, the United States, and Canada into Liaoning 
  province (Hou, 1994, 1995; Chen and Libai, 1997). Rapid introduction of canola 
  in Canadian agriculture in the 1950s and 1960s shows how rapidly farmers can 
  modify their production systems to accommodate a new crop (National Research 
  Council, 1991). Adaptation to declining groundwater tables by substituting dryland 
  for irrigated crops in regions of the U.S. Great Plains is an example of substitutions 
  to deal with water becoming a scarce production resource (Glantz and Ausubel, 
  1988). None of these examples, however, deals specifically with an evolving 
  climate change and all are historic&#151;which limits confidence in extending 
  their conclusions to future climate change.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5343"></a>5.3.4.3. Agronomic Adaptation of Yields </h4>
<p>Increasing numbers of studies have investigated the effectiveness of agronomic 
  adaptation strategies (e.g., adjustments in planting dates, fertilization rates, 
  irrigation applications, cultivar traits) in coping with climate-induced yield 
  losses and gains since the SAR (see <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a>). 
  Considerable costs could be involved in this process, however&#151;for example, 
  in learning about and gaining experience with different crops or if irrigation 
  becomes necessary. In some cases, a lack of water resulting from climate change 
  might mean that increased irrigation demands cannot be met (see <a href="191.htm#472">Section 
  4.7.2</a>).</p>
<p>Methodologically, there has been little progress since the SAR in modeling 
  agronomic adaptations. On one hand, the adaptation strategies being modeled 
  are limited to a small subset of a much larger universe of possibilities, which 
  may underestimate adaptive capacity. On the other hand, the adaptations tend 
  to be implemented unrealistically, as though farmers are perfectly clairvoyant 
  about evolving climate changes, which may inflate their effectiveness (Schneider 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Some studies find agronomic adaptation to be most effective 
  in mid-latitude developed regions and least effective in low-latitude developing 
  regions (Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1998; Parry <i>et al</i>., 1999). This finding 
  clearly is supported across the studies summarized in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 
  5-4</a>, although the number of studies that include adaptation is not large. 
  A small number of studies in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a> compare yield 
  changes with and without agronomic adaptation. Percentage changes in yields 
  across a range of climate change scenarios for those studies are shown in <a href="#fig52">Figure 
  5-2</a>. Each pair of vertical bars represents the range of percentage changes 
  by crop, with and without adaptation, for each study. Clearly, adaptation ameliorates 
  yield loss (and enhances yield gains) in most instances. The median adapted 
  yields (mid-point of the vertical bars) shift upward relative to the median 
  unadapted yields in six of the eight studies. Two studies do not show such an 
  upward shift (Mongolia, Romania) because of peculiarities in the modeling (see 
  figure caption). Adaptation ameliorates the worst yield losses in seven of the 
  eight studies.<br>
</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that differences in modeling methodology 
  and aggregation of results often lead to conflicting conclusions in specific 
  regions. For example, in two studies that used the same GCM scenarios, Matthews 
  <i>et al</i>. (1997) simulate large increases, whereas Winters <i>et al</i>. 
  (1999) simulate large decreases in rice yield with adaptation across several 
  countries in Asia (see <a href="213.htm#5341">Table 5-4c</a>). Hence, confidence 
  in these simulations is low.<br>
</p>
<p> Important work has investigated the geographic distribution of crop potential 
  under climate change. Carter and Saarikko (1996) used crop models to demonstrate 
  a poleward shift in Finnish potential cereal cultivation by 100-150 km 
  for each 1&deg;C increase in mean annual temperature. Reyenga <i>et al</i>. 
  (1999) indicate that climate change accompanied by a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is likely to enable expansion of existing Finnish wheat-growing areas into dry 
  margins, considerably extending potential cropping areas. This expansion is 
  moderated by dry conditions but not effectively enhanced by wetter conditions.

        <p><b>Box 5-5. Extending Uncertainty in Crop Models to Uncertainty in 
          Economic Analysis</b></p>
        <p align="left">Several factors contribute uncertainty to modeling of 
          impacts of climate change on agricultural systems (Parry <i>et al</i>., 
          1999). Crop modeling studies invariably highlight the need to develop 
          confidence that the outputs are not "model-dependent." There 
          is uncertainty because of the fact that yield estimates obtained in 
          climate impact assessments vary from one impact model to another. In 
          some cases, simulations across models may exhibit good agreement. Comparison 
          of rice models showed that their predictions for potential production 
          were quite close to observed values (Peng <i>et al</i>., 1995). The 
          Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC), a generalized crop model, 
          predicts observed yields most closely during years with extreme warmth, 
          lending confidence to its ability to predict yields under climate change 
          conditions (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 1996). In other situations, agreement 
          is not as good. In comparisons between wheat simulation models (Goudriaan 
          <i>et al</i>., 1994; Wolf <i>et al</i>., 1996), grain yield predictions 
          were markedly different between models. Such findings have stimulated 
          work to compare the performance of different models and to analyze the 
          underlying reasons for differences (Gregory <i>et al</i>., 1999; Mearns 
          <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Spatial resolution of crop models is another important 
          source of uncertainty in crop models. Crop models simulate processes 
          that regulate growth and development at fine scales (a few kilometers), 
          whereas climate change scenarios that drive crop models typically are 
          produced by climate models operating at coarse scales (1,000 km or more) 
          (Barrow and Semenov, 1995; Easterling <i>et al</i>., 1998). Studies 
          that use statistical downscaling techniques and nested limited area 
          numerical models to increase the resolution of GCM scenarios of climate 
          change have shown large simulated yield discrepancies between coarse-resolution 
          (GCM) and fine-resolution (downscaled) climate change scenarios. Mearns 
          <i>et al</i>. (1999) demonstrate for a site in Iowa that yields can 
          change algebraic sign depending on the resolution of the climate change 
          scenario: Maize yield decreases (-11%) with low-resolution climate change 
          (CSIRO model) and increases (2%) with high-resolution climate change 
          (RegCM limited area model nested within CSIRO model). Causes of variance 
          in model output must be identified.</p>

<h4><a name="5344"></a>5.3.4.4. Adaptation of Livestock</h4>
<p>Significant costs can be incurred to counter the effects of climate change 
  on animal production; moreover, the impact of a warmer climate in terms of costs 
  is not linear: Larger changes in climate can increase costs exponentially (Hahn 
  and Morgan, 1999). Possible benefits of climate change during cooler seasons 
  are not well documented, but the benefits are likely to be less than the consequential 
  negative hot weather impacts (Hahn <i>et al</i>., 1992). The ability of livestock 
  managers to cope with climate is demonstrated daily in their coping with normally 
  varying conditions. A variety of management adaptations are available for livestock 
  production systems. For example, Hahn and Mader (1997) outline a series of proactive 
  management countermeasures that can be taken during heat waves (e.g., shades 
  and/or sprinklers) to reduce excessive heat loads. Historical success in coping 
  with climate variability suggests that livestock producers are likely to adjust 
  to climate change successfully. Johnson (1965) provides examples from advances 
  in genetics and breeding as related to the environment. These capabilities should 
  allow adaptation to changing, less favorable circumstances associated with projected 
  rates of climate change. However, coping can entail significant dislocation 
  costs for certain producers. For individual producers, uncertainties associated 
  with potential climate change imply additional risks related to how and when 
  to adapt current production practices (Lewandrowski and Schimmelpfennig, 1999). 
  Confidence in the foregoing projections of the ability of livestock producers 
  to adapt their herds to the physiological stresses of climate change is difficult 
  to judge. The general lack of simulations of livestock adaptation to climate 
  change is problematic. This absence of a well-developed livestock counterpart 
  to crop modeling of adaptation assessments suggests a major methodological weakness. 
  Hence, we give only low to moderate confidence in projections of successful 
  livestock adaptability.</p>
