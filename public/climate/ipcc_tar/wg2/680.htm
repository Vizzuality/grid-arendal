<h3>19.6.3. Impacts of Climate Change Singularities </h3>
<p>This subsection sketches the most evident singularities discussed in the context 
  of climate change and reviews the pertinent literature on their potential impacts.</p>
<h4><a name="19631"></a>19.6.3.1. Extreme Weather Events</h4>
<p>That the occurrence of weather events is essentially stochastic is a well-established 
  fact (e.g., Lorenz, 1982; Somerville, 1987). Most climatic impacts arise from 
  extreme weather events or from climatic variables exceeding some critical level 
  and thereby affecting the performance or behavior of a biological or physical 
  system (e.g., Downing et al., 1999). The same holds for the impacts of climate 
  change (see <a href="054.htm">Chapters 1</a>, <a href="068.htm">2</a>, and <a href="122.htm">3</a>, 
  especially <a href="152.htm#tab39">Table 3-9</a>; Pittock and Jones, 2000). 
</p>
<p>For many important climate impacts, we are interested in the effects of specific 
  extreme events or threshold magnitudes that have design or performance implications. 
  To help in zoning and locating developments or in developing design criteria 
  for the capacities of spillways and drainage structures, the heights of levee 
  banks, and/or the strengths of buildings, for example, planners and engineers 
  routinely use estimated "return periods" (the average time between 
  events) at particular locations for events of particular magnitudes. Such event 
  magnitudes include flood levels (Hansen, 1987; Handmer et al., 1999) and storm-surge 
  heights (Middleton and Thompson, 1986; Hubbert and McInnes, 1999). Return period 
  estimates normally are based on recent instrumental records, sometimes augmented 
  by estimates from other locations, or statistical or physically based modeling 
  (Middleton and Thompson, 1986; Hansen, 1987; Beer et al., 1993; National Research 
  Council, 1994; Pearce and Kennedy, 1994; Zhao et al., 1997; Abbs, 1999). The 
  assumption usually is made that these statistics, based on past events, are 
  applicable to the future&#151;but climate change means that this often will 
  not be the case.</p>
<p>Thus, a central problem in planning for or adapting to climate change and estimating 
  the impacts of climate change is how these statistics of extreme events are 
  likely to change. Similar problems arise in nonengineering applications such 
  as assessing the economic performance or viability of particular enterprises 
  that are affected by weather&#151;for example, farming (Hall et al., 1998; Kenny 
  et al., 1999; Jones, 2000)&#151;or health effects (Patz et al., 1998; McMichael 
  and Kovats, 2000; see also Chapter 9).</p>
<p>Relatively rapid changes in the magnitude and frequency of specified extreme 
  events arise because extremes lie in the low-frequency tails of frequency distributions, 
  which change rapidly with shifts in the means. Moreover, there also can be changes 
  in the shape of frequency distributions, which may add to or subtract from the 
  rate of change of extremes in particular circumstances (Mearns et al., 1984; 
  Wigley, 1985, 1988; Hennessy and Pittock, 1995; Schreider et al., 1997). Such 
  changes in the shape of frequency distributions require special attention. Evidence 
  suggests that they are particularly important for changes in extreme rainfall 
  (Fowler and Hennessy, 1995; Gregory and Mitchell, 1995; Walsh and Pittock, 1998), 
  possibly in the intensities of tropical cyclones (Knutson et al., 1998; Walsh 
  and Ryan, 2000), and in ENSO behavior (Dilley and Heyman, 1995; Bouma et al., 
  1997; Bouma, 1999; Timmermann et al., 1999; Fedorov and Philander, 2000). Return 
  periods can shorten, however, even if none of these higher moment effects emerge; 
  simply moving mean precipitation higher, for example, could make the 100-year 
  flood a 25-year flood. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the central role in impact assessments of the occurrence 
  of extreme weather events gives rise to multiple sources of uncertainty in relation 
  to climate change. The stochastic nature of the occurrence of extremes and the 
  limited historical record on which to base the frequency distribution for such 
  events give rise, even in a stationary climate, to a major uncertainty. Beyond 
  that, any estimate of a change in the frequency distribution under a changing 
  climate introduces new uncertainties. Additional uncertainties relate to our 
  limited understanding of the impacted systems and their relevant thresholds, 
  as well as the possible effects of adaptation, or societal change, in changing 
  these thresholds. If this were not complicated enough, many impacts of weather 
  extremes arise from sequences of extremes of the same or opposite sign&#151;such 
  as sequences of droughts and floods affecting agriculture, settlements, pests, 
  and pathogens (e.g., Epstein, 2000) or multiple droughts affecting the economic 
  viability of farmers (e.g., Voortman, 1998).</p>
<p>Planned adaptation to climate change therefore faces particular difficulty 
  in this environment because projections of changes in the frequency of extreme 
  events and threshold exceedence require a multi-decadal to century-long projected 
  (or "recent" observed) data series, or multiple ensemble predictions 
  (which is one way of generating improved statistics). Thus, it is difficult 
  to base planned adaptation on the record of the recent past, even if there is 
  evidence of a climate change trend in the average data. Planned adaptation therefore 
  must rely on model predictions of changes in the occurrence of extreme and threshold 
  events (e.g., see Pittock et al., 1999), with all their attendant uncertainties. 
  Real-life adaptation therefore will most likely be less optimal (more costly 
  or less effective) than if more precise information on future changes in such 
  thresholds and extremes were available.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, planned adaptation will most likely proceed in response to changes 
  in the perceived relative frequency of extreme events. Properly done, it can 
  have immediate benefit by reducing vulnerability to current climate as well 
  as future benefit in reducing exposure to future climate change. As suggested 
  above, however, there are many ways to respond inappropriately if care is not 
  taken. In short, changes in extremes and in the frequency of exceeding impacts 
  thresholds are a vital feature of vulnerability to climate change that is likely 
  to increase rapidly in importance because the frequency and magnitude of such 
  events will increase as global mean temperature rises.</p>
