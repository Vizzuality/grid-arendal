<h2>17.5. Future Requirements, Information, and Research Needs</h2>
<p>Although good progress has been made in understanding the vulnerability and 
  adaptation potential of small island states to climate change, the foregoing 
  discussion highlights critical information gaps and uncertainties that still 
  exist. It has been established that small island states constitute a very high-risk 
  group of countries as a consequence of their high vulnerability and low adaptive 
  capacity. Climate change is inevitable, even if any global agreement to limit 
  GHG emissions were swiftly implemented. Thus, the need to focus on adaptation 
  options and requirements already is critical for small islands, given that these 
  countries are projected to suffer disproportionately from the effects of climate 
  change (Bijlsma, 1996; Nurse <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Nicholls <i>et al.</i>, 1999; 
  Gillespie and Burns, 2000). The agenda set out below therefore is designed not 
  only to fill existing knowledge gaps but also to help identify opportunities 
  for minimizing the adverse effects of climate change (including avoidance of 
  maladaptation), as an important component of adaptation planning in these islands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For most small islands, the lack of geographical detail is a critical shortcoming. 
    Outputs from GCMs currently used to assess climate change impacts in small 
    islands are coarse and do not provide adequate information for countries at 
    the scale of small islands. Hence, there is an urgent need for downscaling 
    the outputs of the GCMs to better define and understand island-scale processes 
    and impacts.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Research into the sensitivity of small islands to climate change, employing 
    an integrated approach, should continue. Studies on the vulnerability of human 
    and biophysical systems to climate change and their interaction with and response 
    to natural and human stresses (including extreme events ) need to be integrated 
    because the more common "reductionist" approaches tend to be deficient 
    in their treatment of interactive effects. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some small island states have initiated efforts to reduce the impact of 
    natural disasters and to use seasonal to interannual climate analysis and 
    climate forecasts to reduce the impacts of natural hazards. Because long-term 
    climate change may result in a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like state, with more frequent 
    and severe extreme climate events, support to build on these past efforts 
    could help to reduce the vulnerability of these islands to climate change. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Although small islands have many characteristics in common, the heterogeneity 
    factor should not be overlooked. Local conditions on widely varying island 
    types (e.g., tectonic changes, shorelines with large sediment availability 
    versus those with sediment deficits, highly fragmented versus single-island 
    states) may increase or decrease climate change impacts, so the outcomes could 
    be dramatically different in each small island setting. Climate change assessments 
    under such varying circumstances would improve present understanding of vulnerability 
    and adaptation requirements in small islands. <br>
  </li>
  <li> Given their wide geographical dispersion, there is a need for a coordinated 
    monitoring program for small islands that evaluates the long-term response 
    of ecosystems to climate variability and change. The focus of such an effort 
    should be on the complex interactions that may occur within human and natural 
    systems to modify the frequency and magnitude of impacts expected and to identify 
    ecosystems that may be in danger of collapsing, so that timely adaptive action 
    might be taken. Such work would help to improve our understanding of the concepts 
    of homeostasis, resilience, and feedback mechanisms, which&#151;though frequently 
    alluded to in the literature&#151;are poorly understood and are critical for 
    adaptation planning at the local and regional scale.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Although the susceptibility of small islands to climate change impacts 
    is high and adaptive capacity is low, the overall level of vulnerability varies 
    within and among states. Thus, vulnerability indices being developed and refined 
    specifically for small islands [Crowards, 1999 (Caribbean Development Bank); 
    Kaly <i>et al.,</i> 1999 (SOPAC)] have the potential to make a significant 
    contribution to adaptation planning and implementation in this constituency. 
    Countries therefore might wish to consider continuation of this work among 
    their research priorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there is some uneasiness in the small island states about perceived 
  overreliance on the use of outputs from climate models as a basis for planning 
  risk reduction and adaptation to climate change. There is a perception that 
  insufficient resources are being allocated to relevant empirical research and 
  observation in small islands. Climate models are simplifications of very complex 
  natural systems; they are severely limited in their ability to project changes 
  at small spatial scales, although they are becoming increasingly reliable for 
  identifying general trends. In the face of these concerns, therefore, it would 
  seem that the needs of small island states can best be accommodated by a balanced 
  approach that combines the outputs of downscaled models with analyses from empirical 
  research and observation undertaken in these countries. </p>
