<h2>2.2. Detection of Response to Climate Change by Using Indicator Species or 
  Systems</h2>
<p>Climate change may cause responses in many human and natural systems, influencing 
  human health (disease outbreaks, heat/cold stress), agriculture (yield, pest 
  outbreaks, crop timing), physical systems (glaciers, icepack, streamflow), and 
  biological systems (distributions/abundances of species, timing of events). 
  In intensely human-managed systems, the direct effects of climate change may 
  be either buffered or so completely confounded with other factors that they 
  become impossible to detect. Conversely, in systems with little human manipulation, 
  the effects of climate change are most transparent. Systems for which we have 
  a good process-based understanding of the effects of climate and weather events, 
  and have had minimal human intervention, may act as indicators for the more 
  general effects of climate change in systems and sectors where they are less 
  readily studied.</p>
<h3><a name="221"></a><i>2.2.1. Detection in Natural Systems</i></h3>
<h4><a name="2211"></a>2.2.1.1. Predicted Physical Responses to Climatic Warming 
  Trends</h4>
<p>The cryosphere is very sensitive to climate change because of its proximity 
  to melting. Consequently, the size, extent, and position of margins of various 
  elements of the cryosphere (sea ice, river and lake ice, snow cover, glaciers, 
  ice cores, permafrost) are frequently used to indicate past climates and can 
  serve as indicators of current climate change (Bradley and Jones, 1992; Fitzharris, 
  1996; Everett and Fitzharris, 1998). In particular, former glacier extent is 
  indicative of past glacials and the Little Ice Age. At high latitudes and high 
  altitudes, ice cores have provided high-resolution annual (and, in some cases, 
  seasonal) records of past precipitation, temperatures, and atmospheric composition. 
  These records stretch back for many hundreds of years, well before the instrumental 
  period, so they have proven to be very valuable in documenting past climates. 
  Borehole measurements provide data on permafrost warming. Later freeze-up and 
  earlier breakup of river and lake ice is measurable at high latitudes.</p>
<p>Interpretation of climate change resulting from changes in the cryosphere is 
  seldom simple. For example, in the case of glaciers, glacier dynamics and extent 
  are influenced by numerous factors other than climate. Different response times 
  are observed for the same climate forcing, so some glaciers can be in retreat 
  while others are advancing. Changes in glacier size can be caused by changes 
  in temperature or in precipitation&#151;or even a nonlinear combination of both. 
  Similarly, changes in sea ice can be a result of changes in ice dynamics (winds, 
  currents) as much as thermodynamics (temperature). Thus, attribution of the 
  exact nature of climate change from changes in the cryosphere is quite complicated.</p>
<p>With many measures of the cryosphere, there frequently is large interannual 
  variability. This makes determination of possible anthropogenic climate trends 
  difficult to distinguish from the natural noise of the data. Another problem 
  is that high-resolution records usually are not available, except from polar 
  or high-altitude ice cores. Changes in the extent of sea ice and seasonal snow 
  are best observed with satellites, but such records are relatively short (from 
  about 1970), so long-term climate change is difficult to distinguish from short-term, 
  natural variability. The first records of cryospheric extent and changes often 
  come from documentary sources such as old diaries, logbooks of ships, company 
  records, and chronicles (Bradley and Jones, 1992). Although these sources are 
  fraught with difficulty of interpretation, they clearly demonstrate climate 
  changes such as the medieval warm period and the Little Ice Age (see <a href="258.htm">Section 
  5.7</a>, <a href="592.htm">Chapter 16</a>, and <a href="663.htm">Section 19.2</a>).</p>
