<h4><a name="171432"></a>17.1.4.3.2. Precipitation</h4>
<p>In general, all AOGCMs simulate only a marginal increase or decrease in annual 
  rainfall. An area-averaged annual mean increase in precipitation of approximately 
  0.3% for the 2050s and 0.7% for the 2080s over the Pacific Ocean area is projected, 
  either as a consequence of increases in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs or 
  because of the combined influence of GHGs and sulfate aerosols. The projected 
  increase in precipitation is at a maximum during NH summer (June-July-August) 
  for both time periods. A marginal decline in precipitation is projected for 
  the other three regions, particularly during NH summer&#151;suggesting the possibility 
  of reduced water availability (Lal<i> et al.,</i> 2001).</p>
<h4><a name="171433"></a>17.1.4.3.3. Extreme high temperature and precipitation 
  events</h4>
<p>An analysis of model-simulated daily temperature and precipitation data (from 
  CSIRO and ECHAM model experiments) for the present-day atmosphere and for the 
  two future time slices (2050s and 2080s) projects that the frequency of extreme 
  temperatures during the summer is likely to be higher in all four regions. This 
  implies an increased likelihood of thermal stress conditions during the 2050s 
  and more so during the 2080s. Similarly, although the models project a lesser 
  number of annual rainy days, an increase in the daily intensity of precipitation 
  also is projected (Lal <i>et al.,</i> 2001). This suggests an increase in the 
  probability of occurrence of more frequent droughts, as well as floods, in the 
  Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian and 
  Pacific Oceans.</p>

<h4><a name="171434"></a>17.1.4.3.4. ENSO and precipitation variability</h4>
<p>Although it is difficult to obtain reliable regional projections of climate 
  change from GCMs, some consistent patterns are beginning to emerge for the Pacific 
  with regard to ENSO and precipitation variability. Although ocean temperatures 
  over most of the western and southern Pacific warm more slowly than the global 
  average, the eastern central Pacific warms faster than the global average in 
  outputs from several AOGCMs (Meehl and Washington, 1996; Timmerman <i>et al., 
  </i>1997; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Jones<i> et al.,</i> 1999). These results 
  have been broadly interpreted as an El Ni&ntilde;o-like pattern (e.g., Cai and 
  Whetton, 2000) because some simulations appear to project more frequent ENSO-like 
  patterns (Timmerman <i>et al., </i>1997). In the Pacific, climate variability 
  associated with the ENSO phenomenon manifests itself on a seasonal to decadal 
  time scale. This, in turn, affects factors such as temperature, rainfall, wind 
  speed and direction, sea level, and tropical cyclone climatology that are directly 
  associated with numerous climate-related impacts in the region. </p>
<p>Jones <i>et al. </i>(1999) have produced projected ranges of change in average 
  temperature and rainfall for the western Pacific, based on scaled patterns from 
  three independent AOGCMs and a suite of two AOGCMs and a regional circulation 
  model (RCM). These scaled patterns were produced by the regression method described 
  in Hennessy <i>et al.</i> (1998) and Giorgi and Mearns (1999), in which the 
  influences of decadal variability are significantly reduced. Jones <i>et al.</i> 
  (1999) showed that warming in the Pacific region is projected to increase by 
  less than the global average in most cases. Projections of rainfall are constrained 
  by the models' ability to simulate the SPCZ and ITCZ. All models were able 
  to produce aspects of both features, although the eastern part of the ITCZ was 
  not well captured by any of the models; the higher resolution models were the 
  most realistic. The models also did not produce consistent changes to these 
  features, execept for a large increase in rainfall over the central and east-central 
  Pacific. Most of the projected changes across the western Pacific were increases, 
  with significant increases along the equatorial belt from North Polynesia to 
  further east. Possible decreases were noted in some models for Melanesia and 
  South Polynesia in both halves of the year (April-October and November-March).</p>
<p>Climate variability in the Pacific is a combination of seasonal, multi-annual 
  variability associated with the ENSO phenomenon and decadal variability, the 
  latter influencing the ENSO phenomenon itself. The major concern for impacts 
  in the region is not with the mean climate changes described above but with 
  the extremes that are superimposed on those mean changes. Numerous studies describe 
  the likely intensification of rainfall when the mean change ranges from a slight 
  decrease to an increase. For instance, mean decreases of 3.5% over South Polynesia 
  from the mixed-layer GCM (UKHI) produced little change in intensity, whereas 
  an increase of 7.5% over Micronesia halved the return periods of heavy rainfall 
  events (Jones <i>et al.,</i> 1999).</p>
<p>GCMs currently project an increase in SSTs of approximately 1&deg;C by the 
  2050s and increased rainfall intensity in the central equatorial Pacific, which 
  would impact many small island states in that region. Recent variations over 
  the tropical Pacific Ocean and surrounding land areas are related to the fact 
  that since the mid-1970s, warm episodes (El Ni&ntilde;o) have been relatively 
  more frequent or persistent than the opposite phase (La Ni&ntilde;a). There 
  are indications that the ENSO phenomenon may be the primary mode of climate 
  variability on the 2- to 5-year time scale and that the current large interannual 
  variability in the rainfall associated with ENSO is likely to dominate over 
  any mean effects attributable to global warming (Jones <i>et al.,</i> 1999).</p>
<p>Comparisons between observations and model simulations for the Pacific region 
  further indicate that regional warming would be mostly less than the global 
  average because of the large expanse of ocean. However, there has been a strong 
  indication from several model simulations that the least warming would occur 
  in the southern ocean; the greatest warming could be expected in the far west, 
  central, and eastern equatorial Pacific. In the case of rainfall, increases 
  are likely to be greater where warming over the ocean is greatest, although 
  one GCM output showed no increase in rainfall variability between 1960 and 2100. 
  Model variability is likely to be much lower than historical variability because 
  of the great influence of ENSO, particularly in the Pacific (Jones <i>et al., 
  </i>1999).</p>
<h4><a name="171435"></a>17.1.4.3.5. Tropical cyclones</h4>
<p>There is no consensus regarding the conclusions of studies related to the behavior 
  of tropical cyclones in a warmer world. Working Group I concludes that current 
  information is insufficient to assess recent trends, and confidence in understanding 
  and models is inadequate to make firm projections (see TAR WGI). Royer et al. 
  (1998), using a downscaled AOGCM coupled with Gray's method for hurricane 
  forecasting, found no significant change in hurricane frequency or geographical 
  extent for the north Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, or the Indian Ocean. 
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing conclusions, individual studies have reported 
  the likelihood of a possible increase of approximately 10-20% in intensity of 
  tropical cyclones under enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (Holland, 1997; Tonkin<i> 
  et al.</i> 1997). This finding is supported by Jones <i>et al.</i> (1999), who 
  conducted an analysis of tropical cyclones from a 140-year simulation of an 
  RCM nested in a coupled AOGCM for the Pacific region (see <a href="626.htm#box171">Box 
  17-1</a>). Although the preliminary analysis implies that there might be a small 
  decrease in cyclone formation, an increase in system intensity is projected. 
  The pattern of cyclones during phases of ENSO was unchanged, suggesting that 
  the relationship between cyclone distribution and ENSO may continue. The study 
  by Jones <i>et al.</i> (1999) considers that increases in cyclone intensity 
  (10-20%) estimated by Tonkin <i>et al.</i> (1997) and Holland (1997) are highly 
  likely.</p>
