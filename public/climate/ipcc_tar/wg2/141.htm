<h4>3.4.6.2. Development and Application of Water Resource Scenarios</h4>
<p>Water resource scenarios have been developed at different time and space scales. 
  For example, projections to 2025 on the basis of national water resource monitoring 
  data have been reported by Shiklomanov (1998). Model-based projections of water 
  use and availability to 2025 at the river basin scale have been made by Alcamo 
  et al. (2000), assuming a BAU scenario and two alternative, normative scenarios 
  that focus on water conservation. Some results of these scenario exercises are 
  shown in <a href="138.htm#tab33">Table 3-3</a>. Among the most developed scenarios 
  of water quality are model-based scenarios of acidification of freshwaters in 
  Europe (e.g., NIVA, 1998). More general normative scenarios describing rural 
  and urban access to safe drinking water by 2025 and 2050 are presented by Raskin 
  et al. (1998). Scenarios of water availability have been applied in several 
  climate change impact studies. Most of these are in the water resources sector 
  and are reported in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>. However, they are increasingly 
  being applied in multi-sectoral and integrated assessments (e.g., Strzepek <i>et 
  al</i>., 1995).</p>
<h3><a name="347"></a>3.4.7. Scenarios of Marine Pollution</h3>
<h4><a name="3471"></a>3.4.7.1. Reference Conditions</h4>
<p>Marine pollution is the major large-scale environmental factor that has influenced 
  the state of the world oceans in recent decades. Nutrients, oxygen-demanding 
  wastes, toxic chemicals (such as heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, potential 
  endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and environmental estrogens), pathogens, sediments 
  (silt), petroleum hydrocarbons, and litter are among the most important contaminants 
  leading to degradation of marine ecosystems (Izrael and Tsyban, 1989; GESAMP, 
  1990; Tsyban, 1997). The following ranges of concentrations of heavy metals 
  are characteristic of open ocean waters: mercury (0.3-7 ng l<small><sup>-1</sup></small>), 
  cadmium (10-200 ng l<small><sup>-1</sup></small>), and lead (5-50 
  ng l<small><sup>-1</sup></small>); levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons are a 
  few ng l<small><sup>-1</sup></small>. Chemical contaminants and litter are found 
  everywhere in the open ocean, from the poles to the tropics and from beaches 
  to abyssal depths. Nonetheless, the open ocean still remains fairly clean relative 
  to coastal zones, where water pollution and the variability of contaminant concentrations 
  are much higher (often by one to two orders of magnitude; specific values depend 
  on the pattern of discharge and local conditions).</p>
<h4><a name="3472"></a>3.4.7.2. Development and Application of Marine Pollution 
  Scenarios</h4>
<p>Data characterizing the state of the marine environment have been obtained 
  through national as well as international monitoring programs in recent decades, 
  and analysis of tendencies may serve as an initial basis for developing environmental 
  scenarios. At present, expert judgment appears to be the most promising method 
  of scenario development because modeling methods are insufficiently developed 
  to facilitate prediction. </p>
<p>In qualitative terms, trends in marine pollution during the 21st century could 
  include enhanced eutrophication in many regions, enhancement of exotic algal 
  blooms, expanded distribution and increased concentration of estrogens, invasion 
  of nonindigenous organisms, microbiological contamination, accumulation of pathogens 
  in marine ecosystems and seafood, and increases of chemical toxicants (Izrael 
  and Tsyban, 1989; Goldberg, 1995).</p>
