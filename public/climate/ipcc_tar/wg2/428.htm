<h4>11.2.1.2. Lakes/Streams, Rivers, and Glaciers </h4>
<p>Lakes, streams, glaciers, and other freshwater ecosystems in Asia are highly 
  diversified in terms of plant and animal species. These freshwater ecosystems 
  have been stressed by environmental burdens, exploitation of natural resources, 
  transformation of lands, and recreational activities. There is growing concern 
  that climate change may accelerate the damage to freshwater ecosystems such 
  as lakes, marshes, and rivers. More than 50,000 ha of coastal territories, including 
  35,000 ha of delta in the Selenga River and 12,000 ha of delta in the Upper 
  Angara River, have been damaged during the past few years by precipitation and 
  riverflow increases (Anokhin and Izrael, 2000). With an increased amount of 
  precipitation likely in the future, more incidences of flooding and other adverse 
  impacts are possible. With a rise in temperature, a decrease in the amount of 
  snowfall in the Lake Biwa catchment in Japan is projected&#151;which might exacerbate 
  the process of eutrophication (Fushimi, 2000a). Deterioration of lake water 
  quality also is suggested in Kasumigaura Lake in eastern Japan (Fujimoto et 
  al., 1995; Fukushima et al., 2000). The response of lakes and streams to climate 
  change will involve complex interactions between the effects of climate on areal 
  inputs, hydrology, and catchments and in-lake processes.</p>
<p>Many of the major rivers in Asia have long been targets for development projects 
  related to the hydroelectric, water supply, agriculture, industry, and navigation 
  sectors. As a consequence, there have been shifts between freshwater and estuarine 
  conditions as a result of high freshwater flows during the rainy season and 
  low to nonexistent freshwater flows in the dry season. Increasing literol vegetation 
  is causing health risks for local habitats in many countries of south Asia. 
  Changes in aquatic habitat also have affected fisheries in lower valleys and 
  deltas; the absence of nutrient-rich sediments has detrimental effects on fish 
  productivity. Reduced flows in lower valley catchments also have resulted in 
  eutrophication and poor water quality.</p>
<p>Many rivers originate from the glaciers in the Tianshan mountain range, which 
  create wide alluvial fans at the foot of the northern Tianshan. The Hindukush 
  Himalayan ranges are the source of some major rivers. The total amount of water 
  flowing from the Himalayas to the plains of the Indian subcontinent is estimated 
  at about 8.6 x 106 m<sup>3</sup> per year. The Himalayas have nearly 1,500 glaciers; 
  it is estimated that these glaciers cover an area of about 33,000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  (Dyurgerov and Meier, 1997). These glaciers provide snow and the glacial meltwaters 
  keep major rivers perennial throughout the year. In recent decades, the hydrological 
  characteristics of watersheds in this region seem to have undergone substantial 
  change as a result of extensive land-use change&#151;leading to more frequent 
  hydrological disasters, enhanced variability in rainfall and runoff, extensive 
  reservoir sedimentation, and pollution of lakes (Ives and Messerli, 1989). Almost 
  67% of the glaciers in the Himalayan and Tienshan mountain ranges have retreated 
  in the past decade (Ageta and Kadota, 1992; Yamada et al., 1996; Fushimi, 2000b). 
  The mean equilibrium-line altitude at which snow accumulation is equal to snow 
  ablation for glaciers is estimated to be about 50-80 m higher than the 
  altitude during the first half of the 19th century (Pender, 1995). Available 
  records suggest that Gangotri glacier is retreating by about 30 m yr<sup>-1</sup>. 
  A warming is likely to increase melting far more rapidly than accumulation. 
  As reported in IPCC (1998), glacial melt is expected to increase under changed 
  climate conditions, which would lead to increased summer flows in some river 
  systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear.
