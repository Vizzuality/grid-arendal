<h4><a name="152315"></a>15.2.3.1.5. Role of changing water resources</h4>
<p>Although several studies have examined the potential implications of climate 
  change for streamflows and water delivery reliability from reservoir systems 
  in regions where irrigated agriculture is now important (see <a href="554.htm">Section 
  15.2.1</a>), there have been few direct analyses of the economic impacts on 
  irrigated agriculture of changes in water availability. Some assessments of 
  the impacts of climate change on agriculture in North America have relied on 
  optimistic assumptions regarding the availability of irrigation water to offset 
  precipitation deficiencies (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Other studies have attempted 
  to estimate the impacts of projected climate change on the potential use of 
  irrigation water. A study of potential climate change impacts on irrigation 
  water use in the United States concluded, "The greatest impact of a warmer climate 
  on the agricultural economy will be in the West where irrigators will be hard 
  put to maintain even present levels of irrigation" (Peterson and Keller, 1990). 
  That conclusion is based on first-order impacts of reduced water availability 
  and does not consider possible earnings from sale or lease of water rights.</p>
<p>Studies of the impacts of drought events may provide useful insights into the 
  impacts of substantial changes in seasonal streamflows that may result from 
  climate warming&#151;particularly in western North America, where mountain snowpacks 
  now sustain streamflows into the summer months (see <a href="554.htm">Section 
  15.2.1</a>). However, the impacts of short-term droughts are an imperfect analog 
  to long-term impacts of a drier climate because farmers are likely to adjust 
  crop choices and farming practices as they acquire experience with any new climate 
  regime.<br>
</p>
<p> Under some scenarios, demand for irrigation water declines (e.g., as a result 
  of more rapid crop maturation and/or increased growing-season precipitation). 
  Scenarios investigated for the U.S. National Assessment (Reilly et al., 2000) 
  suggest that demand for water resources by agriculture would decline nationwide 
  on the order of 5-10% by 2030 and 30-40% by 2090. Land under irrigation 
  showed similar magnitudes of decline. Crop yield studies generally favor rainfed 
  over irrigated production and show declines in water demand on irrigated land. 
  Such adaptations could help to relieve some of the stress on regional water 
  resources by freeing water for other uses (Hurd et al., 1999). However, the 
  interplay between changes in irrigation demand and changes in water supplies 
  has not been fully assessed.</p>
<h4><a name="152316"></a>15.2.3.1.6. Carbon sequestration </h4>
<p>North American soils have lost large quantities of carbon since they first 
  were converted to agricultural systems, leaving carbon levels in agricultural 
  soils at about 75% of those in native soils (Bruce et al., 1999c). Because carbon 
  in agricultural soils is a manageable pool, it has been proposed that these 
  soils be managed to sequester carbon from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The rate at which carbon is lost has subsided for most agricultural soils, 
  and carbon levels in some soils have been maintained or even begun to increase 
  as conservation farming practices have been adopted in the past 15-20 years. 
  On cultivated land, these practices include conservation tillage (i.e., reduction 
  or elimination of tillage) and residue management, use of winter cover crops, 
  elimination of summer fallow, and methods to alleviate plant-nutrient and water 
  deficiencies and increase primary production (Lal et al., 1998). Revegetation 
  of marginal lands and modified grazing practices on pastures can be used to 
  increase soil carbon levels. On degraded soils, preventing and controlling erosion 
  and reducing salinization help to maintain or increase soil carbon. Greater 
  adoption of these measures in the United States and Canada could result in agricultural 
  soils more effectively capturing carbon from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
</p>
<p> However, these agricultural practices that are effective in building soil 
  carbon also may result in greater emissions of other GHGs (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O). 
  Therefore, research is needed to weigh the positive and negative effects of 
  building up soil carbon with respect to the overall goals of reducing GHG emissions. 
  Moreover, implementation of such mitigation strategies and their effects on 
  adaptation need further evaluation from the perspective of practical economics 
  and land management decisions (see <a href="564.htm#box151">Box 15-1</a>). <br>
  <br>
  Some scenario studies suggest that interactions between soil and atmosphere 
  will occur under a positive feedback system as temperatures increase: Higher 
  temperatures will cause greater decomposition of soil carbon, in turn causing 
  greater emissions from soil of CO<sub>2</sub>, which will enhance the greenhouse 
  effect and cause even higher temperatures. However, there is evidence that negative 
  feedback mechanisms also exist. Some experiments indicate that more primary 
  production is allocated to roots as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rises (Schapendonk 
  et al., 1997), and these roots decompose more slowly than those grown at ambient 
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels (Van Ginkel et al., 1997). Recent comprehensive analyses 
  of field data of forest soils suggests that increased temperature alone will 
  not stimulate decomposition of forest-derived carbon in mineral soil (Giardina 
  and Ryan, 2000).</p>
<p>Analysis of yield trends for 11 major crops over the period 1939-1994 
  indicates that the rate at which yield increased ranged from 1% on average to 
  more than 3% yr<sup>-1</sup> (Reilly and Fuglie, 1998). Conservative extrapolation of yields 
  implies that the average annual increase in yield for the 11 crops between 1994 
  and 2020 would range from 0.7 to 1.3% yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small>. More optimistic 
  estimates of growth rates indicate that yield increases could be as high as 
  3% yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small>. These yield increases could lead to substantial 
  increases in soil carbon if crop residues are retained.</p>
