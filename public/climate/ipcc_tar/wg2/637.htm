<h3><a name="1734"></a>17.3.4. Adaptation and Adaptive Capacity </h3>
<p>As Campbell (1996) notes, a key misconception is that adaptation is a task 
  carried out by governments. Insofar as governments have property and are responsible 
  for carrying out a variety of activities, they will be required to take adaptive 
  action. Most adaptation, however, will be carried out by individual stakeholders 
  and communities, urban or rural, that inhabit island countries. Therefore, the 
  government's primary role is to facilitate and steer this process&#151;ideally 
  in a manner that benefits the wider community.</p>
<p>Small island states often are susceptible to the impacts of a wide range of 
  natural hazards, including climatic extremes. In the south Pacific region alone, 
  island states suffered a total of 79 tropical cyclones, 95 storm surges, 12 
  floods, 31 droughts, four earthquakes, five landslides, two tsunamis, and four 
  volcanic eruptions during the 1990s (Burns, 2000; Gillespie and Burns, 2000; 
  Hay, 2000). The World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction and the Global 
  Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island States noted several issues 
  that influence adaptation to such impacts. These issues include the limited 
  capacity of developing small island states to respond to and recover from natural 
  and environmental disasters, owing to their narrow resource base and small size. 
  Another issue is the decline in traditional coping mechanisms employed by island 
  states, such as food preservation and storage techniques and disaster-resistant 
  housing designs.</p>
<p>Given their high vulnerability, it is generally accepted that a proactive approach 
  to adaptation planning would be especially beneficial to small islands, to minimize 
  the adverse effects of climate change and sea-level rise (Campbell and de Wet, 
  2000). One essential prerequisite for implementing adaptive measures is support 
  from policymakers and the general public. Thus, raising public awareness and 
  understanding about the threats of climate change and sea-level rise and the 
  need for appropriate adaptation require urgent and consistent attention. Because 
  strong social and kinship ties exist in many small island states&#151;for example, 
  in the Pacific&#151;a community-based approach to adaptation could be vital 
  if adaptation policies and options are to be successfully pursued. </p>
<p>It also should be noted that small island states have faced many hazards in 
  the past; as a consequence, their inhabitants have developed some capacity to 
  cope by resorting to a combination of strategies, including application of traditional 
  knowledge, locally appropriate technology (e.g., construction on stilts in flood-prone 
  areas), use of indigenous materials, and other customary practices. Thus, for 
  these states, it would be mandatory for any climate change adaptation policy 
  and implementation plan to incorporate these traditional coping skills. <br>
  <br>
  One of the obstacles to implementation of adaptation strategies stems from the 
  uncertainties associated with the projection of future climate change and its 
  impacts, at scales appropriate to small islands. Therefore, better guidance 
  is needed for policy development in the face of uncertainties, together with 
  more reliable climate projections at a scale that is relevant to the small island 
  states (Edwards, 2000).</p>
<p>Many island states confront a range of pressing socioeconomic concerns (e.g., 
  poverty alleviation, unemployment, health, and education), and climate change 
  tends to be assigned a low priority on most national agendas. Thus, given the 
  long lead time for implementing and assesing adaptation (as much as 50-100 
  years), progress in realizing its goals almost certainly will require integration 
  of adaptation strategies with other sectoral and national policies, such as 
  economic development, disaster prevention and management, integrated coastal 
  management, and sustainable development frameworks. </p>

              Island States in the Pacific </b> </div>
            <p>Based on application of the IPCC <i>Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
              Gas Inventories,</i> Pacific island countries are responsible for 
              a per capita equivalent emission of approximately 0.96 t of CO<sub>2</sub> 
              yr<sup>-1</sup>. Hence, the total Pacific island population of 7.1 
              million in 22 countries produces 6.816 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>. 
              In contrast, based on International Energy Agency data for 1996, 
              global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions arising from fossil fuel combustion 
              alone are 22,620.46 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, or 4.02 
              t of CO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> per capita. Thus, on average, 
              Pacific islanders produce approximately one-quarter of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
              emissions attributable to the average person worldwide. Expressed 
              another way, the Pacific islands region as a whole accounts for 
              0.03% of the global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fuel combustion 
              despite having approximately 0.12% of the world's population.</p>

            <div align="center"><b>Box 17-4. Renewable Energy Use in Small Island 
              States: A "Win-Win" Strategy </b> </div>
            <p>Most small islands are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels 
              for the majority of their energy requirements, particularly transport 
              and electricity production. This is clearly demonstrated in the 
              case of the Caribbean and Pacific islands, where petroleum imports 
              are responsible for more than 75 and 88%, respectively, of primary 
              energy demand. The cost of fossil fuel imports also places a considerable 
              economic burden on small island states, accounting on average for 
              almost 15% of all imports in these countries. In addition, the cost 
              of electricity production (US$0.10-0.15 and 0.20 kWh<sup>-1</sup> 
              for the Caribbean and the Pacific, respectively) can be as much 
              as three to four times higher than in developed countries.</p>
            <p>In many islands, the high unit cost of conventional power production 
              versus the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technologies 
              (especially solar and wind), make the latter economically viable 
              and environmentally friendly options. For these reasons, several 
              small island states are making a significant contribution to global 
              utilization of renewable energy resources. These include, <i>inter 
              alia,</i> the following countries:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Barbados, where approximately 33% of all households use solar 
                water heaters</li>
              <li>La Desirade, Guadeloupe, where more than 75% of all electricity 
                is generated from wind power</li>
              <li>Fiji and Dominica, where hydropower accounts for more than 30% 
                of electricity production</li>
              <li>Tuvalu, where photovoltaics supply 45% of the electricity</li>
              <li>Reunion, where almost 20% of the electricity is biomass-generated 
                (from bagasse, a by-product of sugarcane); bagasse also is becoming 
                increasingly important as an energy source in Jamaica and Fiji.</li>
            </ul>

<h3><a name="1735"></a>17.3.5. Regional and External Factors</h3>
<p>Small island states account for a small percentage of world energy consumption 
  and extremely low levels of global HG emissions and on balance are likely to 
  be severely impacted by the effects of climate change (Yu <i>et al.</i>, 1997; 
  see <a href="#box173">Box 17-3</a>). In most states, the bulk of the energy 
  requirements are met from imported fossil fuels, which places a heavy burden 
  on island economies (Yu <i>et al., </i>1997). Adaptation and mitigation strategies 
  in these countries, as elsewhere, will necessitate more economic and efficient 
  energy use and greater emphasis on development of renewable energy sources (see 
  <a href="#box174">Box 17-4</a>). </p>
<p>To implement these strategies, many small islands, will require external technical, 
  financial, and other assistance (Rijsberman, 1996). Given these states' 
  size and limited individual capacities, pooling of resources through regional 
  cooperation has been proposed as an effective means of designing and implementing 
  some adaptation measures (Nicholls and Mimura, 1998). Some island groupings 
  already have begun to implement regional projects aimed at building capacity 
  to respond to climate change. Two projects&#151;Caribbean Planning for Adaptation 
  to Climate Change (CPACC), which is being implemented by 12 Caribbean states, 
  and Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Program (PICCAP), which is being 
  executed by SPREP for 10 Pacific island countries&#151;are outstanding models 
  of regional cooperation.</p>
