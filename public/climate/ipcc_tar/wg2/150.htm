<h3>3.6.6. Application of Scenarios </h3>
<h4><a name="3661"></a>3.6.6.1. Simple Scenarios</h4>
<p>Simple scenarios are based on one or several estimates of sea-level rise consistent 
  with IPCC-projected ranges of global sea-level rise for a particular date. Usually 
  a mid-range or upper estimate is chosen. The application of a eustatic scenario, 
  where a relative scenario is required, discounts the impact of regional sea-level 
  change and local land movements, although it is possible to add the latter explicitly 
  where estimates exist (Gambolati <i>et al</i>., 1999). Assessments that use 
  simple scenarios usually test whether a coastal region is sensitive and/or vulnerable 
  to a plausible upper limit of climate change (e.g., Zeidler, 1996; El Raey <i>et 
  al</i>., 1997; Olivo, 1997).</p>
<h4><a name="3662"></a>3.6.6.2. Projected Ranges</h4>
<p>A range of global sea-level rise can be applied, bounded by its upper and lower 
  extremes, for a particular date (e.g., Ali, 1996; Nicholls <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  This will project a likely range of impacts but without any reference to the 
  likelihood of that range or specific changes within that range (<a href="093.htm">Section 
  2.5</a>). The major disadvantage of this technique is the large range of uncertainty 
  that is produced, making it difficult for policymakers and planners to decide 
  on a concrete response.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Box 3-2. The Global Impact of Climate Change on Five 
        Sectors (Parry and Livermore, 1999)</b></p>
      <p>In this assessment, the prospective effects of unmitigated climate change 
        during the 21st century are estimated at a global scale in five sectoral 
        studies (see <a href="151.htm#tab38">Table 3-8</a>). Each study has different 
        scenario requirements, though some are common to several studies. For 
        example, the ecosystems study estimates potential biomass on the basis 
        of scenarios of climate, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and nitrogen deposition, 
        but it ignores future land-cover and land-use changes that would be expected 
        regardless of climate change. In contrast, the study on food security 
        examines the effects on crop productivity of the same scenarios of climate 
        (though for fewer variables) and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration; it too 
        ignores likely land-cover and land-use changes and does not consider effects 
        of nitrogen deposition, although it adopts a range of socioeconomic and 
        technological scenarios to evaluate the number of persons at risk from 
        hunger.</p>
      <p>Notably, across all of the studies the scenarios adopted are designed 
        to be mutually consistent. For instance, the population and GDP scenarios 
        are those adopted in constructing the IS92a emissions scenario (Leggett 
        <i>et al</i>., 1992). An approximation of the IS92a emissions scenario 
        is used to force the HadCM2 and HadCM3 GCMs that were employed to construct 
        the climate and sea-level scenarios (Hulme <i>et al</i>., 1999b). Other 
        scenarios are chosen to be broadly consistent with these assumptions. 
        The scenarios are required as inputs to global impact models, and results 
        from these are described elsewhere in this report. Finally, it also should 
        be noted that although these studies are compatible and consistent, they 
        are not integrated across sectors. For example, climate-induced changes 
        in water resources for irrigation are not accounted for in estimates of 
        future food security.</p>

<p><a name="box32"></a>Risk assessment aims to produce meaningful outcomes under 
  conditions of high uncertainty. For sea-level rise, two approaches to risk assessment 
  have been reported. The first approach is to construct a probability distribution 
  for a single outcome. For example, Titus and Narayanan (1996) conclude that 
  a sea-level rise of 10&#150;65 cm by 2100 has an 80% probability of occurring; 
  the 99th percentile was associated with a 104-cm rise. The second approach is 
  to calculate the probability of exceedance above a given threshold identified 
  as a hazard. Pittock and Jones (2000) suggest the use of critical thresholds, 
  which link an unacceptable level of harm with a key climatic or climate-related 
  variable. For coastal impacts, the critical threshold is then linked to a projected 
  range of sea-level scenarios, through key climatic and marine variables, and 
  its risk of exceedance calculated (Jones et al., 1999).</p>
  IAMs attempt to represent the interaction of human activities with socioeconomic 
  and biophysical systems on a global scale (see <a href="133.htm">Section 3.3.2.3</a>). 
  In the TARGETS model (Rotmans and de Vries, 1997), various human activities 
  that affect a succession of phenomena are simulated to produce scenarios of 
  sea-level rise, which then lead to calculations of people and capital at risk 
  in low-lying coastal regions (Hoekstra, 1997). The IMAGE 2 integrated model 
  applies baseline scenarios of global environmental change (Alcamo et al., 1996) 
  to project several global outcomes, one of which is sea-level rise. Yohe and 
  Schlesinger (1998) used a model of global economic activity to produce emissions 
  profiles, which they then used to calculate temperature and sea-level changes 
  and integrated with an economic damages model for the U.S. coastline. The scenarios 
  of sea-level rise were probabilistically weighted from a sample of 280 to calculate 
  the 10th and 90th percentiles and the median estimate, producing several ranges 
  similar in magnitude to that of Titus and Narayanan (1996).<br>
