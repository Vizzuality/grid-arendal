<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>North America has experienced challenges posed by changing climates and changing 
  patterns of regional development and will continue to do so. Varying impacts 
  on ecosystems and human settlements will exacerbate subregional differences 
  in climate-sensitive resource production and vulnerability to extreme events. 
  Opportunities may arise from a warming climate, and some innovative adaptation 
  strategies are being tested as a response to current challenges (e.g., water 
  banks), but there are few studies on how these strategies could be implemented 
  as regional climates continue to change. Recent experience demonstrates high 
  capability in emergency response to extreme events, but long-term problems remain.</p>
<h3><a name="1"></a>Climate Trends and Scenarios</h3>
<p>North America has warmed by about 0.7&deg;C during the past century and precipitation 
  has increased, but both trends are heterogeneous (e.g., seasonal reductions 
  in precipitation in some areas). <br>
</p>
<p>For a range of emission scenarios produced for this Third Assessment Report, 
  model results suggest that North America could warm by 1-3&deg;C over the 
  next century for a low-emissions case (B1). Warming could be as much as 3.5-7.5&deg;C 
  for the higher emission A2 case. Published regional impact studies have used 
  climate scenarios with global temperature changes that are similar to these 
  new cases, but regional scenarios may not be directly comparable.</p>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Key Regional Concerns</h3>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Water Resources</h4>
<p>Changes in precipitation are highly uncertain. There is little agreement across 
  climate scenarios regarding changes in total annual runoff across North America.</p>
<p>The modeled impact of increased temperatures on lake evaporation leads to consistent 
  projections of reduced lake levels and outflows for the Great Lakes-St. 
  Lawrence system under most climate change scenarios (medium confidence). The 
  only exception is the HadCM2 transient scenario incorporating IS92a sulfate 
  aerosol emissions, which suggests slight increases in lake levels and outflows.</p>
<p>Where snowmelt currently is an important part of the hydrological regime (e.g., 
  Columbia basin), seasonal shifts in runoff are likely, with a larger proportion 
  of runoff occurring in winter, together with possible reductions in summer flows 
  (high confidence).</p>
<p>Adaptive responses to such seasonal runoff changes could include altered management 
  of artificial storage capacity, increased reliance on conjunctive management 
  of ground and surface water supplies, and voluntary water transfers between 
  various water users. It may not be possible, however, to avoid adverse impacts 
  on many aquatic ecosystems or to fully offset the impacts of reduced summer 
  water availability for irrigation and other out-of-stream and instream water 
  uses.<br>
</p>
<p>Where lower summer flows and higher water temperatures occur, there may be 
  reduced water quality and increased stress on aquatic ecosystems (medium confidence). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Possible changes in the frequency/intensity/duration of heavy precipitation 
  events may require changes in land-use planning and infrastructure design to 
  avoid increased damages arising from flooding, landslides, sewerage overflows, 
  and releases of contaminants to natural water bodies.<br>
</p>
<p>Responses to recurring and emerging water quality and quantity problems will 
  provide opportunities to develop and test adaptive management options.</p>
