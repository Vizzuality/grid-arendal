<h4>2.2.1.5. Data and Response Types</h4>
<p>Ranges of migratory or mobile species can be very sensitive to climate when 
  individuals show an immediate response in their migratory destinations. As with 
  climatic data itself, one then needs long time series to distinguish year-to-year 
  variation (noise) from long-term trends. Distributions of sedentary species 
  have an inherent lag time stemming from limited dispersal abilities. Neither 
  the numbers of populations nor the geographic location of the range limit may 
  fluctuate strongly between adjacent years, and detectable shifts in species 
  ranges may take decades or even centuries. In such cases, data often are not 
  continuous through time, although data for a single year can be taken as representative 
  of the state of the species during the surrounding multi-year period. </p>
<p>In addition to these shifts in species distributions, a suite of more subtle 
  "plastic" responses allow organisms to adjust seasonally to natural variations 
  of climate. Phenological changes&#151;that is, shifts in the timing of events&#151;can 
  be assessed. These events include dates of budburst, flowering, seed set, fruit 
  ripening, hibernation, breeding, and migration (Yoshino and Ono, 1996; Bradley 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999; Menzel and Fabian, 1999). Changes in phenologies can be 
  detected in a wide variety of organisms, but this requires studies conducted 
  over several years, in which weekly or daily observations should be made before 
  and during the target event (e.g., flowering). Remote-sensing data have the 
  advantage that they can be analyzed for such effects years after the events, 
  but they are limited to very general, community-wide questions such as dates 
  when the ground begins to turn "green" from spring growth. They indicate trends 
  only for the past 30 years because satellites with suitable detection equipment 
  have been in place only since the early 1970s (Myneni <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  There are very long-term records (i.e., centuries) in a few unusual cases (Lauscher, 
  1978; Hameed, 1994; Sparks and Carey, 1995), but most monitoring data also are 
  in the realm of the past 30 years (see <a href="218.htm">Sections 5.4</a> and 
  <a href="663.htm">19.2</a>).</p>
<p>A different type of rapid response&#151;probably nongenetic&#151;is exemplified 
  by changes in body size of small mammals and lizards (Sullivan and Best, 1997; 
  Smith <i>et al</i>., 1998). Body size becomes smaller with general warming and 
  larger with either cooling or increased variability of climate. This source 
  of information has been studied with reference to historical climate (Morgan 
  <i>et</i> <i>al</i>., 1995; Hadly, 1997; Badgley, 1998); it has been unexplored 
  with respect to current trends and should be given greater attention.</p>
<p>Attribution of an observed biological trend to effects of climate change rests 
  on several grounds (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 2000; Parmesan <i>et al</i>., 
  2000), namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Known fundamental mechanistic links between thermal/ precipitation tolerances 
    and species in the studies</li>
  <li>A large body of theory that links known regional climate changes to observed 
    biotic changes</li>
  <li>Direct observations of climate effects in some studies.</li>
</ul>
