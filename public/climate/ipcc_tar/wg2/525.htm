<h3>14.1.3. Socioeconomic and Trade Agreements Issues</h3>
<h4><a name="14131"></a>14.1.3.1. Socioeconomic Issues</h4>
<p>Latin America has one of the greatest disparities in income distribution in 
  the world. From the social and environmental point of view, the region clearly 
  is vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters. Inappropriate land use, for 
  agriculture and human settlements, in watersheds causes serious damages during 
  the occurrence of extraordinary climate extreme events, such as Hurricanes George 
  and Mitch in Central America and intense rain events in Venezuela and Argentina. 
  CEPAL (1999a,b,c,d,e) estimated losses from Hurricane Mitch (see <a href="#tab142">Table 
  14-2</a>). Losses in Honduras and Nicaragua were 70 and 45% of GNP, respectively, 
  affecting the development and economic growth of both countries. There is strong 
  evidence that the effects of natural disasters contribute to rising poverty 
  and inequality in many regions of Latin America. </p>

<p>The year 1998 was one of the most problematic periods in recent times for Latin 
  America and the Caribbean. The side effects of the international financial crisis 
  that originated in Asia in the middle of 1997 limited the possibilities for 
  the region to obtain external aid. In addition, many adverse climatic events 
  worsened the socioeconomic conditions. The Latin American region hosts a myriad 
  of socioeconomic conditions. Countries with a high level of development coexist 
  with least-developed countries. Macro-economic figures indicate a moderately 
  constant degree of growth in the region, even though more than 200 million people 
  in Latin America are poor (CEPAL, 1998).</p>
<p>The Human Development Report for 1998 (UNDP, 1998), in its section on consumption 
  patterns, notes that the overwhelming majority of people who die each year from 
  pollution are poor people in developing countries. Large cities in Latin America 
  such as Mexico City already have a serious problem with air pollution. The report 
  also identifies several issues that affect most of Latin America which may be 
  increased by global warming, including desertification, floods and storms, and 
  harvest. Poor people are less resilient to these problems. </p>
<p>The World Bank (1997) analyzed the 1982-1983 El Ni&ntilde;o event and, 
  with a great degree of certainty, considered it to be the most intense in the 
  20th century. Losses from droughts, floods, and hurricanes were estimated at 
  US$14 billion. Of these, US$2 billion were lost in the western coast of South 
  America, half in Peru&#151;mainly losses from fishing revenue and destruction 
  of infrastructure. Social losses also were very high. Reconstruction and development 
  of related activities in Peru depleted resources and resulted in losses of 6% 
  in GNP. Damages in Peru in 1997-1998 were on the order of US$1 billion 
  (of which 55% was transportation infrastructure, 15% agriculture, 14% energy, 
  and 9% education), and more than 400 relief projects had to be implemented, 
  requiring emergency attention in 14 of the 24 departments of Peru. Some positive 
  effects resulted, such as increases in pastures (200,000 ha) and reforestation 
  of 100,000 ha.</p>
<p>One sector that might be affected by climate change, based on previous experiences 
  during the ENSO period, is fisheries. Fish capture was reduced by 53% during 
  the 1998 ENSO event (IMARPE, 1998). However, adaptation measures such as changing 
  the species captured and price increases reduced the losses to 40%. Some adaptation 
  options, such as switching from anchovy to tuna, can significantly reduce losses 
  from seawater warming (Arntz and Fahrbach, 1996; IMARPE,1998). Adaptation to 
  flooding conditions may reduce damage from extreme floods. One way to address 
  water-shortage areas is to store excess water; for example, a lake was created 
  in north Peru in 1998 (IMARPE, 1998).</p>
<p>Insurance is an important financial aspect that may be impacted by climate 
  change. A joint World Meteorological Organization/ Inter-American Development 
  Bank (WMO/IDB) meeting&#151;with participation by scientists, bankers, and insurers&#151;recognized 
  the importance of climate change in insurance policy and of the need for increased 
  cooperation (WMO, 1994), but few concrete actions materialized, mainly because 
  insurers feel that larger risks should be compensated with higher insurance 
  premiums.</p>
