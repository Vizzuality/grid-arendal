<h3>19.2.2. Synthesis of Observed Impacts </h3>
<p>There is an accumulating body of evidence of observed impacts relating to regional 
  climate changes&#151;primarily rising temperature across a broad range of affected 
  physical processes and biological taxa&#151;and widespread geographical distribution 
  of reported effects (see <a href="#fig192">Figure 19-2</a> and accompanying 
  notes). In many cases, reported changes are consistent with functional understanding 
  of the climate-impact processes involved. Cases of no change or change in unexpected 
  direction are noted, as are possible alternative explanations and confounding 
  factors, where available.</p>

        (time periods of studies range from ~20 to 150 years), and (2) terrestrial 
        and marine ecosystem studies that associate trends in observed change(s) 
        with trends in regional climate data for &#142;20 years (time periods 
        of studies range from ~20 to 50 years). Of the ~100 physical processes 
        and ~450 biophysical species that exhibited change, more than 90% (~99% 
        physical, ~80% biophysical) are consistent with well-known mechanisms

<h4><a name="19221"></a>19.2.2.1. Hydrology</h4>
<p>The hydrological cycle is expected to respond to regional climate warming through 
  changes in the energy balance of glaciers and the depth and extent of snow cover, 
  earlier snowmelt runoff, seasonal changes in freezing and thawing of lakes and 
  rivers, and intensification of precipitation and evaporative processes. For 
  the most part, evidence of regional climate change impacts on elements of the 
  hydrological cycle is consistent with expected responses to warming temperatures 
  and intensification of hydrological regimes (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 
  4</a> and <a href="196.htm">5</a>, and <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a>). </p>
<p>Evidence for such changes in the 20th century includes recession of glaciers 
  on all continents (e.g., Hastenrath, 1995; Ames and Hastenrath, 1996; Dowdeswell 
  et al., 1997; Dyurgerov and Meier, 1997; Haeberli and Beniston, 1998; Greene 
  et al., 1999; Kaser, 1999; Krabill et al., 1999; Serreze et al., 2001). There 
  have been decreases in the extent of snow cover (10% since the late 1960s and 
  1970s) in the northern hemisphere (e.g., Groisman et al., 1994; Serreze et al., 
  2001). Since the late 1940s, snowmelt and runoff have occurred increasingly 
  earlier in northern and central California (Dettinger and Cayan, 1995). Annual 
  duration of lake- and river-ice cover in the middle and high latitudes of the 
  northern hemisphere has been reduced by about 2 weeks and is more variable (Schindler 
  et al., 1990; Magnuson et al., 2000; Kratz et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Also reported is increased frequency of extreme rainfall in the middle and 
  high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, including the United States (Karl 
  and Knight, 1998), the UK (Osborn et al., 2000), and most extratropical land 
  areas except China (Groisman et al., 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="19222"></a>19.2.2.2. Terrestrial Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Ecological theory predicts several types of species and community responses 
  to changing regional climate in plants and animals: changes in ecosystem structure 
  and dynamics, including shifts in ranges and distributions; altered phenology; 
  effects on physiology; and genetic evolutionary responses (see <a href="068.htm">Chapters 
  2</a> and <a href="196.htm">5</a>). Changes in disturbance (e.g., fires, wind 
  damage) also may be occurring but are not included in this review (see <a href="196.htm">Chapters 
  5</a> and <a href="283.htm">6</a>). Evidence from plants and animals documents 
  all of these types of ecological responses to regional warming, especially poleward 
  and elevational shifts in species ranges and earlier timing of reproduction. 
  Reviews of recent changes in biological systems also have documented examples 
  of these different types of responses, consistent with process-level understanding 
  (Hughes, 2000).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="192221"></a>19.2.2.2.1. Vegetation</h4>
<p>Much of the evidence of vegetation change relating to regional climate change 
  comes from responses to warming at high-latitude and high-altitude environments, 
  where confounding factors such as land-use change may be minimized and where 
  climate signals may be strongest (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>). Increases in species richness were found at 21 of 30 high summits in 
  the Alps; remaining summits exhibited stagnation or a slight decrease (Grabherr 
  et al., 1994; Pauli et al., 1996). However, K&ouml;rner (1999) suggests that 
  grazing, tourism, and nitrogen deposition may be contributing to such observed 
  migrations. Hasenauer et al. (1999) found significant increases in diameter 
  increments of Norway spruce across Austria related to increased temperatures 
  from 1961 to 1990. In North America, Barber et al. (2000) linked reduced growth 
  of Alaskan white spruce to temperature-induced drought stress, and Hamburg and 
  Cogbill (1988) propose that historical declines in red spruce in the northeastern 
  United States are related to climatic warming, possibly aggravated by pollution 
  and pathogen factors. </p>
<p>In more temperate ecosystems, Bradley et al. (1999) documented phenological 
  advances in flowering date in 10 herbaceous and tree species and no change in 
  26 such species related to local warming in southern Wisconsin over the periods 
  1936-1947 and 1976-1998. Menzel and Fabian (1999) document extension 
  of the growing season for 12 tree and shrub species at a network of sites throughout 
  Europe, which they attribute to warming temperature. Alward and Detling (1999) 
  found reorganization of a shortgrass steppe ecosystem in a semi-arid site in 
  Colorado related to increased spring minimum temperatures, although the responses 
  of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species did not occur as expected.</p>
<p>Regarding regional changes in precipitation&#151;which are much more uncertain 
  with regard to future climate&#151;reorganization of a semi-arid ecosystem in 
  Arizona, including increases in woody shrubs, has been associated with increases 
  in winter precipitation (Brown et al., 1997); retraction of mesic species to 
  areas of higher rainfall and lower temperature has been attributed to a long-term 
  decline in rainfall in the West African Sahel (Gonzalez, 2001). </p>
<h4><a name="192222"></a>19.2.2.2.2. Animals </h4>
<p>Temperature change-related effects in animals have been documented within all 
  major taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, insects, mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates) 
  and on all continents (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Terrestrial evidence 
  in animals that follows process-level understanding of responses to warming 
  includes poleward and elevational changes in spatial distribution, alterations 
  in species abundance and diversity, earlier phenology (including advances in 
  timing of reproduction), and physiological and genetic adaptations.</p>
<p>Poleward and elevational shifts associated with regional warming have been 
  documented in the ranges of North American, British, and European butterfly 
  species (Parmesan, 1996; Ellis, 1997; Ellis et al., 1997; Parmesan et al., 1999), 
  birds (Thomas and Lennon, 1999), and insects (Fleming and Tatchell, 1995). Prop 
  et al. (1998) found that increasing spring temperatures and changes in agricultural 
  practices in Norway have allowed barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) to move northward 
  and invade active agricultural areas. Changes in species distribution and abundance 
  of amphibians, birds, and reptiles in Costa Rica have been associated with changing 
  patterns of dry-season mist frequency and Pacific sea-surface temperatures (SST) 
  (Pounds et al., 1999; Still et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Earlier timing of reproduction has been found for many bird species (Mason, 
  1995; Crick et al., 1997; McCleery and Perrins, 1998; Crick and Sparks, 1999; 
  Slater, 1999) and amphibians (Beebee, 1995; Reading, 1998) in the UK and Europe 
  (Winkel and Hudde, 1996, 1997; Ludwichowski, 1997; Forchhammer et al., 1998; 
  Visser et al., 1998; Bergmann, 1999). Zhou et al. (1995) found a warming trend 
  in the spring to be associated with earlier aphid flights in the UK. Also in 
  the UK, Sparks (1999) has associated arrival times of bird migration to warmer 
  spring temperature. Bezzel and Jetz (1995) and Gatter (1992) document delays 
  in the autumn migratory period in the Alps and Germany, respectively. </p>
<p>In North America, Brown et al. (1999) document earlier egg-laying in Mexican 
  jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina) associated with significant trends toward increased 
  monthly minimum temperatures in Arizona. Dunn and Winkler (1999) found that 
  the egg-laying date of North American tree swallows advanced by as much as 9 
  days, associated with increasing air temperatures at the time of breeding. Bradley 
  et al. (1999) document phenological advances in arrival dates for migratory 
  birds in southern Wisconsin, associated with earlier icemelt of a local lake 
  and higher spring temperature.</p>
<p>Post et al. (1997) and Post and Stenseth (1999) document differential selection 
  of body size in red deer throughout Norway from 1965 to 1995. Male red deer 
  have been getting larger and females smaller, correlated with warming trends 
  and variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Post and Stenseth (1999) 
  also report on the interactions of plant phenology, northern ungulates (red 
  deer, reindeer, moose, white-tailed deer, musk oxen, caribou, and Soay sheep), 
  and the NAO. Jarvinen (1994) found that increased mean spring temperatures in 
  Finnish Lapland are associated with mean egg volume of the pied flycatcher. 
  De Jong and Brakefield (1998) found shifts in color patterns (black with red 
  spots versus red with black spots), most likely related to thermal budgets of 
  ladybird beetles (Adalia bipunctata) in The Netherlands, coinciding with an 
  increase in local ambient spring temperatures. The potential for rapid adaptive 
  responses and their genetic costs to populations has been studied by Rodriguez-Trelles 
  and Rodriguez (1998), who found microevolution and loss of chromosomal diversity 
  in Drosophila in northwestern Spain as the local climate warmed.</p>
<h4><a name="19223"></a>19.2.2.3. Coastal Zones and Marine Ecosystems</h4>
<p>In coastal zones and marine ecosystems, there is evidence of changes in physical 
  and biological systems associated with regional trends in climate, especially 
  warming of air temperatures and SST (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a>, <a href="196.htm">5</a>, 
  and <a href="283.htm">6</a>). However, separating out responses of marine ecosystems 
  to variability caused by large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as ENSO 
  and NAO, from regional climate changes is a challenge (e.g., Southward et al., 
  1995; McGowan et al., 1998, 1999; Sagarin et al., 1999). Variations caused by 
  ENSO and NAO per se are not considered climate change, but multi-decadal trends 
  of change in ENSO or NAO frequency and intensity are climate changes, according 
  to the IPCC definition.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="192231"></a>19.2.2.3.1. Physical processes</h4>
<p>Changes in the physical systems of coastal zones related to regional warming 
  trends include trends in sea ice and coastal erosion. Since the 1950s, Arctic 
  sea-ice extent has declined by about 10-15%; in recent decades, there has 
  been about a 40% decline in Arctic sea-ice thickness during late summer to early 
  autumn and a considerably slower decline in winter (e.g., Maslanik et al., 1996; 
  Cavalieri et al., 1997; Johannessen et al., 1999; Rothrock et al., 1999; Vinnikov 
  et al., 1999; Serreze et al., 2001). No significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice 
  extent are apparent (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a>). </p>
