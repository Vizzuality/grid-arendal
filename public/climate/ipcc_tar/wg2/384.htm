        in the Akasompo Dam (Graham, 1995) </b> </div>
      <p>Multiple droughts in recent decades have forced Ghana to reduce the generation 
        of hydroelectricity, provoking a national debate about power supply. </p>
      <p>The Akosombo and Kpong generating stations&#151;commissioned in 1965 
        and 1982, respectively&#151;provide the overwhelming bulk of Ghana's 
        electricity. The two stations account for 1,072 MW of a total national 
        power-generating capacity of 1,160 MW; Akosombo alone provides 833 MW.</p>
      <p>Until recently, most of the minority of Ghanaians who use electricity 
        tended to regard the Volta hydroelectric dams as sources of uninterruptible 
        power. The unprecedented drought of 1982-1983, which compelled rationing 
        of electricity until 1986, shattered that illusion. And if that drought's 
        power cuts jolted the nation's complacency about hydroelectricity, 
        the 1994 incident concentrated minds forcefully on the impermanence of 
        power from Akosombo and Kpong and the need for alternative sources.</p>
      <p>According to the Volta River Authority (VRA), the statutory power generating 
        body, "cumulative inflow" into Volta Lake by the middle of August 
        1994 was "the worst&#133;in the 50-year record of Volta river flows&#151;worse 
        than the same period in 1983." At its lowest, in early August, the 
        level of Volta Lake was 73 m. This was well below the 75.6 m the VRA claims 
        is the minimum level for generating power without risk of damaging the 
        turbines.</p>

<p><b><a name="box103"></a></b>The heterogeneity of ground records in Africa imposes 
  serious limitations in constructing future scenarios of water resources. Where 
  consistent long-term climatic data are available, they indicate a trend toward 
  reduced precipitation in current semi-arid to arid parts of Africa. <a href="383.htm#fig103">Figure 
  10.3</a> of the Hulme <i>et al.</i> (2001) publication shows possible scenarios 
  for different climatic regions of Africa. Although there is ambiguity in the 
  Sahel, the simulations appear to indicate possible increases in precipitation 
  in east Africa, whereas most simulations in southern Africa indicate reduced 
  precipitation in the next 100 years.</p>
<p><a href="383.htm#tab101">Table 10-1</a> shows estimates of ranges of percentage 
  changes in precipitation, potential evaporation, and runoff in African river 
  basins as reconstructed from Arnell (1999, Figure 3). In some basins, estimates 
  given by the HadCM3 simulation have been excluded where they appear to be outliers. 
  A change in the hydrographs of large basins (Niger, Lake Chad, and Senegal) 
  has been observed. Between the mean annual discharge of the humid and drought 
  periods, the percentage of reduction varies from 40 to 60% (Olivry, 1993). <a href="#fig106">Figure 
  10-6</a> shows the change in the hydrograph of the Niger River at the Niamey 
  station. This illustrates a clear modification of the Niger River regime at 
  Niamey. Similar situations are observed at the N'djamena station on the Chari 
  at the entrance to Lake Chad. In the Nile basin, Sircoulon (1999) cites a reduction 
  in runoff of 20% between 1972 and 1987, corresponding to a general decrease 
  in precipitation in the tributary basins calculated by Conway and Hulme (1993). 
  In recent years there have been significant interruptions in hydropower generation 
  as a result of severe droughts (see <a href="#box103">Box 10-3</a>).</p>
<p>Instrumental data and climate model simulations cited above indicate imminent 
  water crisis in large parts of Africa. Several seminal works have appeared in 
  the literature that analyze water for Africa, including Falkenmark (1989) and 
  Gleick (1992, 1998).</p>
<p>Large basin-scale analyses often give the wrong impression that many areas 
  of Africa are rich in water reserves, in which case local water problems could 
  be solved easily by technology that would transfer water from the source to 
  areas under stress, assuming that financial resources are available for such 
  enterprises. Although in theory this may be a practical solution to many water 
  problems in most of Africa, the very high costs associated with such projects 
  make them impractical. Political goals such as self-sufficiency in food production 
  and general socioeconomic development cannot be achieved under severe water 
  scarcity (Falkenmark, 1989). Drought-prone zones of Africa already are water-limited, 
  further increasing their vulnerability to water problems. </p>
<p>About 63% of the total land in Africa lies within transboundary river basins. 
  Five major river basins&#151;the Congo, Nile, Niger, Chad, and Zambezi&#151;occupy 
  about 42% of the geographical area and sustain more than 44% of the African 
  population. Other shared basins in the continent are the Senegal, Gambia, Limpopo, 
  Orange/Senqu, and Cunene Basins.</p>
<p>In west Africa, the dependency ratio&#151;defined as the ratio between renewable 
  water produced out of a country and the total renewable water of the same country&#151;is 
  more than 40% for seven of the nine countries comprising the Permanent Interstate 
  Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS). This ratio is nearly 90% 
  for the Niger and the Mauritania. Similar transboundary dependencies are evident 
  in southern Africa and on the Nile basin. The Congo basin is shared by the most 
  countries (13), followed by the Niger and Nile basins (11 countries each) and 
  the Zambezi and Chad basins (9 and 8 countries, respectively). </p>

<p><b><a name="fig106"></a></b>The impact of changes in precipitation and enhanced 
  evaporation could have profound effects in some lakes and reservoirs. Conway 
  and Hulme (1993) and Calder <i>et al.</i> (1995) have discussed the hydrology 
  and paleohydrology of various African Lakes. Magadza (1996) has examined the 
  impact of drought on reservoirs in Zimbabwe. Reports fron Ghana (Graham, 1995) 
  indicate severe drought impacts on this large reservoir. Studies show that, 
  in the paleoclimate of Africa and in the present climate, lakes and reservoirs 
  respond to climate variability via pronounced changes in storage, leading to 
  complete drying up in many cases. Furthermore, these studies also show that 
  under the present climate regime several large lakes and wetlands show a delicate 
  balance between inflow and outflow, such that evaporative increases of 40%, 
  for example, could result in much reduced outflow. In the case of Lake Malawi, 
  it has been reported that the lake had no outflow for more than a decade in 
  the earlier part of this century (Calder <i>et al.,</i> 1995).</p>
<p>Predictions of response by the Nile to global warming are confounded by the 
  fact that different simulations give conflicting results (Smith <i>et al.,</i> 
  1995), varying from 77% flow reduction in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 
  (GFDL) simulation to a 30% increase in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies 
  (GISS) model. Arnell's (1999) model results suggest increased precipitation 
  in the Nile basin, but such gains are offset by evapotranspiration. Gleick (1992) 
  projects that future climatic changes in the Nile basin would be significant 
  and possibly severe. The response of the Nile basin to precipitation change 
  is not linear, though it is symmetric for increased and decreased precipitation. 
  Hulme (1992) shows a decline in total precipitation and overall warming of about 
  0.5&deg;C over the last half on the 20th century. Conway and Hulme (1993) conclude 
  that the effects of future climate change on Nile discharge would further increase 
  uncertainties in Nile water planning and management, especially in Egypt. Nile 
  precipitation responds more to changes in equatorial circulation, with little 
  influence by the north African monsoon (Sestini, 1993). </p>
<p>Arnell (1999) shows that the greatest reduction in runoff by the year 2050 
  will be in the southern Africa region, also indicating that as the water use-to-resource 
  ratio changes countries such as Zimbabwe and the Magreb region will shift into 
  the high water-stress category. The Zambezi River has the worst scenario of 
  decreased precipitation (about 15%), increased potential evaporative losses 
  (about 15-25%), and diminished runoff (about 30-40%).</p>
<p>Lake Chad varies in extent between the rainy and dry seasons, from 50,000 to 
  20,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Precise boundaries have been established between Chad, 
  Nigeria, Cameroon, and Niger. Sectors of the boundaries that are located in 
  the rivers that drain into Lake Chad have never been determined, and several 
  complications are caused by flooding and the appearance or submergence of islands. 
  A similar process on the Kovango River between Botswana and Namibia led to a 
  military confrontation beteen the two states.<br>
  <br>
  Vorosmarty and Moore (1991) have documented the potential impacts of impoundment, 
  land-use change, and climatic change on the Zambezi and found that they can 
  be substantial. Cambula (1999) has shown a decrease in surface and subsurface 
  runoff of five streams in Mozambique, including the Zambezi, under various climate 
  change scenarios. For the Zambezi basin, simulated runoff under climate change 
  is projected to decrease by about 40% or more.</p>
<p>Growing water scarcity, increasing population, degradation of shared freshwater 
  ecosystems, and competing demands for shrinking natural resources distributed 
  over such a huge area involving so many countries have the potential for creating 
  bilateral and multilateral conflicts (Gleick, 1992). Feddema (1998, 1999) has 
  evaluated the impacts of soil degradation and global warming on water resources 
  for Africa. All major watersheds are affected by global warming; although the 
  trend is toward drying in most locations, there are significant differences 
  in watershed-level responses, depending on timing and distribution of rainfall, 
  as well as soil water-holding capacity. Soil water-holding capacity is modified 
  by the degree of soil degradation.</p>
