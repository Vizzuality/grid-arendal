<h2>8.2. Climate Change and Extreme Events that are Relevant to the Financial 
  Services Sector</h2>
<h3><a name="821"></a>8.2.1. Present-Day Conditions</h3>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="figure"><a href="fig8-1.htm"><img src="images/fig8-1s.gif" border="0"></a><br>
      <b>Figure 8-1:</b> The costs of catastrophic weather events have exhibited 
      a rapid upward trend in recent decades. Yearly economic losses from large 
      events increased 10.3-fold from US$4 billion in the 1950s to US$40 billion 
      per year in the 1990s (all in 1999 US$). The insured portion of these losses 
      rose from a negligible level to US$9.2 billion annually during the same 
      period, and the ratio of premiums to catastrophe losses fell by two-thirds. 
      Notably, costs are larger by a factor of 2 when losses from ordinary, noncatastrophic 
      weather-related events are included (e.g., as shown in <a href="331.htm#fig86">Figure 
      8-6</a>). The numbers generally include "captive" self-insurers but not 
      the less-formal types of self-insurance (Munich Re, 2000). </td>

<p><a name="fig81"></a>Present-day impacts of weather events on financial services 
  are caused mainly by extreme events. Differences in vulnerability exist, caused 
  by geographical location, population distribution, and national wealth. In developing 
  countries, there may be very high mortality from extreme weather but relatively 
  small costs to the financial sector because of low insurance penetration. In 
  developed nations, the loss of life may be much less but may have enormous&#151;even 
  catastrophic&#151;costs to the insurance industry (see <a href="328.htm">Section 
  8.3.1</a>). Swiss Re (2000b) has compiled lists of the 40 worst catastrophes 
  between 1970 and 1999 in terms of insurance losses and fatalities. These lists 
  show that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Of the 40 worst insured losses since 1970, only six were not weather related.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Nineteen of the weather-related catastrophes affected the United States.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Twenty-eight were related to windstorm (tropical and temperate latitudes).</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, of the 40 worst events in terms of fatalities, only 16 were weather 
  related, of which 13 occurred in Asia. A list of natural disasters causing billion-dollar 
  losses drawn up by Munich Re (2000; see <a href="329.htm#tab83">Table 8-3</a>) 
  shows that, of 30 such disasters, 15 affected the United States and seven affected 
  Europe. Eighteen were related to windstorm. With the exception of earthquakes, 
  all were weather related.</p>
<p>In recent decades, economic and insured losses related to weather extremes 
  have increased rapidly (see <a href="#fig81">Figure 8-1</a>). An important part 
  of this trend is related to socioeconomic factors; another part may be explained 
  by climatic factors. Where trends in climate variables do occur, there are two 
  possible principle causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Variability in the natural modes of variability of the global climate system&#151;for 
    example, the Southern Oscillation, with its two characteristic modes of El 
    Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a. In the 1980s and 1990s, El Ni&ntilde;o events 
    occurred more frequently and lasted longer. The longest El Ni&ntilde;o of 
    the 20th century persisted from 1991 to 1995 and was rapidly succeeded by 
    the most intense El Ni&ntilde;o of the 20th century, in 1997-1998 (WMO, 
    1999).<br>
  </li>
  <li> Anthropogenic global warming, which may be expected to lead to changes 
    in all attributes of the climate system. Most obviously, we would expect it 
    to lead to an increased frequency of high-temperature extremes and a reduction 
    in days with very low temperatures. There is evidence that the latter trend 
    already is occurring (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 2000b).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the cause, it is important to note that a relatively small change 
  in the mean of a climate variable can lead to a large change in the occurrence 
  of extremes. Meehl et al. (2000a) explore the implications for extremes of changes 
  in the mean and/or variance; they show clearly that the relationship between 
  a change in the mean and a change in the occurrence of extremes is nonlinear, 
  as illustrated in <a href="325.htm#fig82">Figure 8-2.</a></p>
