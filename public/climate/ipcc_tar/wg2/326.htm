<h3>8.2.3. Climate Events that are Relevant to the Insurance and Other Financial 
  Services Sectors</h3>
<p>Most weather extremes have relevance for the financial sector, as shown in 
  <a href="#tab81">Table 8-1</a>. Column 6 summarizes the impacts of extremes 
  on the main sectors of activity considered by <a href="index.htm">TAR WGII</a>. 
  The ways in which these impacts affect the insurance industry are shown in Column 
  7. </p>
<p><i>Hot Temperature Extremes.</i> Hot summers are likely to become more common 
  as a result of global warming. The nonlinear effect of global warming on extreme 
  events (see <a href="325.htm#fig82">Figure 8-2</a>) can be clearly illustrated 
  by the example of temperature. Hulme (1997) estimates for the UK that the change 
  in mean annual temperature in 2035 relative to the 1961-1990 mean will be approximately 
  1&deg;C. Yet as a result, temperature conditions similar to those in the exceptional 
  (1-in-300 years) summer of 1995 should occur once every 10 years on average 
  between 2021 and 2050. Insurance claims could rise because of land subsidence, 
  business interruption, and crop failure. Although heat waves have been shown 
  to lead to an increase in daily mortality and morbidity (see <a href="353.htm">Section 
  9.4.1</a>)&#151;an impact that may be compounded by poor air quality&#151;the 
  effect is likely to be too small to noticeably affect the financial services 
  sector.</p>

<p><i>Cold Temperature Extremes.</i> As a result of global warming, cold extremes 
  of winter weather are likely to become rarer. In temperate latitudes, this development 
  generally would be beneficial for business activities in, for example, the construction 
  and transport sectors, with concomitant reductions in claims for business interruption. 
  Although cold conditions should become rarer, a more active hydrological cycle 
  might lead to more episodes of heavy snowfall, provided that temperatures remain 
  below freezing. Regional shifts in the occurrence of phenomena such as ice storms 
  may be expected. Ice storms occur when precipitation falls as rain but freezes 
  on contact with a solid surface. Air temperatures close to freezing are ideal 
  for ice storm occurrence. Thus, in colder regions where the weather currently 
  is well below freezing in the winter, ice storms may become more common as a 
  result of global warming, although they could become less frequent in areas 
  where they occur at present (Francis and Hengeveld, 1998). An ice storm that 
  occurred 7-10 January 1998, in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, 
  led to insured damage estimated at US$1.2 billion (Lecomte <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p><i>Heavy Rainfall and Flooding. </i>TAR WGI <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a> 
  indicates that "many models" now project that conditions in the tropical Pacific 
  may become more El Ni&ntilde;o-like, with associated changes in precipitation 
  patterns (Meehl <i>et al</i>., 2000b). This would lead to more frequent patterns 
  of El Ni&ntilde;o-like floods and drought conditions in areas where teleconnections 
  to the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exist. Observational studies 
  assessed in TAR WGI <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> suggest that there has been 
  a widespread increase in heavy and extreme precipitation events in regions where 
  total precipitation has increased (i.e., the middle and high latitudes of the 
  Northern Hemisphere). Flooding is responsible for 40% of total economic losses 
  and 10% of weather-related insurance losses globally.</p>
<p>Tropical hurricanes can lead to landslides. Hurricane Mitch probably is the 
  most well-known event in recent years. This system, the strongest ever October 
  tropical storm in the Atlantic Basin, stalled over Central America and produced 
  more than 600 mm of rainfall in 48 hours. Resulting landslides and mudslides 
  led to an estimated 9,000 deaths and insured losses of US$513 million (Swiss 
  Re, 2000b). In disasters of this magnitude, preparedness and planning can make 
  a huge difference in loss of life and the amount of damage sustained. </p>
<p>Large river basin floods develop over huge areas following weeks of unusually 
  high rainfall. In July and August 1997, flooding in central Europe caused 54 
  fatalities in Poland and required the evacuation of 162,000 people (Kundzewicz 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1999). The value of the economic losses throughout central Europe 
  amounted to approximately US$5 billion, with insured losses of US$940 million. 
  The intensity of such flood events is driven not only by climatology but also 
  by human management of the watershed.</p>
<p><i>Low Rainfall&#151;Drought, Land Subsidence, and Wildfire.</i> Drought is 
  important for the financial sector through impacts on commercial agriculture, 
  building foundations, and wildfire occurrence. <a href="326.htm#fig83">Figure 
  8-3</a> shows the cost of subsidence claims to the industry from 1975 to 1997 
  in England and Wales. There is a clear relationship with rainfall (with some 
  lag effects). Similar effects are seen in France (Radevsky, 1999). Where insurance 
  is used as the mechanism to finance repairs to building foundations, as in the 
  UK and France, costs for domestic properties can be higher than where the damage 
  is not insured, as in Australia. Adaptive responses such as stronger foundations 
  in new buildings and repairs to older housing capital should reduce the problem.</p>

<p><a name="fig83"></a>The worst drought of recent decades has occurred (indeed, 
  it persists) in theSahelian region of West Africa, where since 1968 rainfall 
  has been below the long-term average in almost every year (Nicholson <i>et al</i>., 
  2000). The strength and persistence of this deficit is unparalleled in recent 
  times. Despite the drought's severity, it has had minimal impact on the 
  commercial financial sector because of the low penetration of insurance in the 
  region. However, the drought's role in the development of the region has 
  been significant. </p>
<p>Wildfire is an increasingly important insurance issue, as illustrated by the 
  US$140 million economic losses sustained in the Los Alamos fire of 2000 (Hofmann, 
  2000b). Outdoor fire occurrence is likely to increase in a future warmer climate, 
  particularly along the increasingly popular urban-rural fringe (Swiss Re, 1992; 
  Torn <i>et al</i>., 1998). Whereas in Europe most wildfires are of human origin 
  (either deliberate or accidental), lightning (see below) is still the leading 
  cause of forest fires in the western United States and Alaska (the regions of 
  North America with the greatest number of wildfires). </p>
<p>Even if rainfall amounts are unchanged by global warming, higher temperatures 
  will increase the level of risk associated with these hazards because of increased 
  water loss through evaporation and transpiration.</p>
<p><i>Lightning Strikes.</i> Model experiments are not able to tell us anything 
  directly about changes in lightning occurrence as a result of global warming. 
  Any increase in convective activity should lead to more frequent electrical 
  storms and lightning discharges, and it seems likely that global warming will 
  have such an effect in the tropics (Lal <i>et al</i>., 1998) and in extratropical 
  latitudes (White and Etkin, 1997). Reeve and Toumi (1999) suggest that a 1&deg;C 
  increase in average wet-bulb temperature can be accompanied in mid-latitudes 
  by a 40% increase in lightning. Of relevance to insurers, lightning is a cause 
  of fires and damage to electrical equipment, with associated business interruption 
  claims (Mills <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
<p><i>Tropical and Extratropical Windstorm.</i> Experiments with climate models 
  to date have not produced a consensus regarding the likely future occurrence 
  of tropical and extratropical wind storms. Both have a very large capacity to 
  cause damage. Hurricane Andrew, for example, occurred in 1992 in the Atlantic 
  Basin and made landfall over the United States, causing US$21 billion (1999 
  US$) in insured damage. Hurricane Floyd, which caused US$2.2 billion in insured 
  losses in 1999, required the evacuation of 2 million people and imposed huge 
  stress on infrastructure, resources, and ultimately health. The most damaging 
  extratropical windstorm was Daria in 1990, which caused US$6.8 billion in insured 
  losses in northwestern Europe. In December 1999, windstorms Martin and Lothar 
  tracked south of the normal route, affecting France, northern Spain, and central 
  Europe. Together they caused 140 fatalities and US$8.4 billion in insured damage.</p>
<p><i>Sea-Level Rise.</i> Increases in sea level pose a major potential risk to 
  coastal zones (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/212.htm">Chapter 6</a>), 
  especially if they are associated with an increase in storminess. The mid-range 
  increase in sea level by the year 2100 as a result of anthropogenic climate 
  change is 49 cm, taking into account atmospheric aerosol concentrations, with 
  estimates ranging from 26 to 72 cm (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>). The main risk to the financial sector is in the effect that this change 
  in mean sea level may imply for the occurrence of tidal surges, which already 
  cause enormous damage and loss of life, especially in the developing world (<a href="344.htm#box84">see 
  Box 8-4</a>). One of Europe's greatest natural disasters in terms of loss of 
  life was the 1953 storm surge in the North Sea, which led to almost 2,000 fatalities 
  in The Netherlands and the UK</p>
