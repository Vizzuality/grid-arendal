<h4>10.2.5.3. Flooding </h4>
<p>Because of their combination of several natural resources, such as fisheries 
  and fertile alluvial soils, wetlands and floodplains often are sites of dense 
  rural settlements as well as urban settlements, such as N'Djamena near 
  Lake Chad and coastal areas of southern Mozambique. The east Africa floods of 
  1998 and the Mozambique floods in early 2000 caused considerable damage to property 
  and infrastructure. The major infrastructure damage was road and rail network 
  damage. Communications among human settlements in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and 
  Tanzania were seriously disrupted, impeding movement of goods and persons in 
  the region (Magadza, 2000). Many refugees could not be reached by land in Somalia, 
  resulting in significant depletion of their food and medical supplies and leading 
  to mortalities. Road and rail links to seaports were disrupted. In both instances, 
  relief operations were hampered by difficulty of access to affected communities. 
  In Mozambique, the floods of early 2000 caused approximately 2 million people 
  to be displaced or severely affected; about 600 died (&lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.reliefweb.int">http://www.reliefweb.int</a>&gt;, 
  accessed October 10, 2000). By October 2000, the estimated cost of the Mozambique 
  floods stood at more than US$167 million in terms of emergency aid funds during 
  the flooding and in immediate activities to rehabilitate the infrastructure 
  and relocate displaced persons. The impact on the national economy is still 
  being evaluated but is expected to be significant.</p>
<p>One identifiable adaptive measure against extreme events that are climate related 
  is a state of preparedness to give adequate warning of imminent danger and deliver 
  relief. Facilities to broadcast timely information of developing events such 
  as storms to rural populations remain weak. National disaster plans are available 
  in some countries, but financial resources to respond to emergencies are lacking. 
  The ability to convey impacts quickly to the international media is a factor 
  in the speed and amount of relief. Recent events in Mozambique and other countries 
  of southern and east Africa will provide useful lessons in dealing with similar 
  disasters; there is great value in studying these events not only from the physical 
  point of view&#151;as the Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) 
  is proposing in a new Africa program; see &lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dkrz.de/clivar/hp.html">http://www.dkrz.de/clivar/hp.html</a>&gt;&#151;but 
  also from the social point of view. </p>
<p>There is a need for better understanding of the hydrology of river basins to 
  identify vulnerable areas and plan coping mechanisms. Management of early warning 
  systems depends on good understanding of the dynamics of flood systems in real 
  time.</p>
<p>Because river basins sometimes involve more than one state, as in the Somalia 
  floods, an effective flood management protocol will call for international cooperation. 
  A regular bulletin of flood development in Ethiopia would have given the coastal 
  inhabitants of Somalia time to prepare for damage minimization. In the Mozambique 
  floods of 1996-1997, for example, the trigger was heavy rains in the Shire 
  River basin. If the Shire and Zambezi Rivers were managed as one basin system, 
  it would have been possible to alleviate flooding in the Zambezi delta by manipulating 
  Zambezi river flow, using the flood control capacity of Lakes Kariba and Kabora 
  Bassa.</p>
<p>A further need in formulating adaptive strategies is more refined regional 
  climate change scenarios&#151;especially a better understanding of extreme events. 
  In southern Africa, for example, most of the regional climate change scenarios 
  are rather ambivalent with regard to precipitation (Hulme, 1996). In the 1998-1999 
  season, the city of Harare suffered damage to its roads because sewer transport 
  could not cope with entrained stormwater. If it were accepted that the frequency 
  of such seasons would increase, future designs of infrastructure amenities would 
  take cognizance of that prediction. </p>
<h4><a name="10254"></a>10.2.5.4. Energy</h4>
<p>Threats to energy security from climate change impacts are outlined in <a href="383.htm">Section 
  10.2.1</a>. Disruption of energy supplies will have ripple effects in the social 
  fabric through impacts in economic activity. Some adaptation options for the 
  energy needs of settlements in the African region are in three broad areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional cooperation in sharing hydroelectric potential of the continent, 
    especially that of the Zaire River<br>
  </li>
  <li>More intensive use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy and 
    biogas<br>
  </li>
  <li>Efficient use of biomass.</li>
</ul>
<p>The countries of the southern and central African region (Democratic Republic 
  of the Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia) 
  already are networked on an electric power grid system. Climate change models 
  to date indicate minimum changes in the hydrology of the Congo basin, whereas 
  other basins have significant vulnerability to climate change. A regional project 
  to develop the hydropower potential of the Congo basin could significantly increase 
  the energy security of the region without resort to GHG-emitting, coal-driven 
  thermal power plants.</p>
<p>Alternatives to biomass are wind-driven units, either as direct application 
  of wind force&#151;as in water-pumping windmills&#151;or for generation of electricity, 
  as in the windmill farms of Denmark. Biogas units, which utilize livestock dung, 
  have been demonstrated successfully in rural areas of Zimbabwe.</p>
