<h4>5.6.3.1.3. Insect herbivory, pests, and diseases </h4>
<p>Some evidence suggests that insect populations already are responding to climate 
  change (Fleming and Tatchell, 1995). In general, current forecasts of the response 
  of forest insects and other pathogens to climate change are based on historical 
  relationships between outbreak patterns and climate. These forecasts suggest 
  more frequent or longer outbreaks (Thomson and Shrimpton, 1984; Thomson et al., 
  1984; Mattson and Haack, 1987; Volney and McCullough, 1994; Carroll et al., 
  1995; Cerezke and Volney, 1995; Brasier, 1996; Roland et al., 1998). Outbreaks 
  also may involve range shifts northward, poleward, or to higher elevations (Williams 
  and Liebhold, 1997). All of these responses will tend to reduce forest productivity 
  and carbon stocks, although the quantitative extent of these changes is hard 
  to predict (see <a href="247.htm#box510">Box 5-10</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="56314"></a>5.6.3.1.4. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p>At the time of the SAR, no experiments on intact forest ecosystems exposed 
  to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had been performed. Since then, several FACE experiments have 
  been implemented and are beginning to show interesting results. In a 13-year-old 
  loblolly pine plantation (North Carolina), CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been maintained at 
  200 ppm above ambient. After 2 years, the growth rate of the dominant trees 
  increased by about 26% relative to trees under ambient conditions (DeLucia et 
  al., 1999). Litterfall and fine root increment also increased under the CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched 
  conditions. Total NPP increased by 25%. The study concludes, however, that stimulation 
  is expected to saturate not only because each forest stand tends toward its 
  maximum carrying capacity (limited by nutrient capital) but also because plants 
  may become acclimated to increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels. </p>
<p>Research on CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, however, has taken place only over a short fraction 
  of the forest ecosystem's life cycle. Questions of saturation of response 
  can be addressed through longer term experiments on tree species grown under 
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in open-top chambers under field conditions over several growing 
  seasons (Norby et al., 1999). A review of such experiments by Norby et al. (1999) 
  found that the evidence shows continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis, 
  with little evidence of long-term loss of sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>; the relative effect 
  on aboveground dry mass was highly variable but greater than indicated by seedling 
  studies, and the annual increase in wood mass per unit of leaf area increased. 
  Norby et al. (1999) also found that leaf nitrogen concentrations were lower 
  in CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched trees, but not as low as seedling studies indicated, and the 
  leaf litter C/N ratio did not increase. In the majority of CO<sub>2</sub> chamber experiments, 
  the decrease in the percentage of nitrogen in litter was matched by an increase 
  in the percentage of lignin. Moore et al. (1999) have suggested, however, that 
  lower litter quality caused by CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization may have offset the expected 
  temperature-induced increase in decomposition. A longer term perspective still 
  is needed because long-term trends cannot be extrapolated directly from relatively 
  short-term experiments on individual trees (Idso, 1999). Field experiments on 
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub> provide inconclusive evidence at this time to predict overall changes 
  in carbon storage in forests.</p>
