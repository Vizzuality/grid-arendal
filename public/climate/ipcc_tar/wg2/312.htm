<h2>7.3. Energy, Transportation, and Other Climate-Sensitive Industry</h2>
<h3> <a name="731"></a>7.3.1. Energy Supply and Demand </h3>
<p>The SAR notes that climate change would impact energy supply and demand. Subsequent 
  studies confirm this sensitivity. Hydropower generation is the energy source 
  that is most likely to be impacted because it is sensitive to the amount, timing, 
  and geographical pattern of precipitation as well as temperature (rain or snow, 
  timing of melting) (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Where reduced streamflows 
  occur, they are expected to negatively impact hydropower production; greater 
  streamflows, if they are timed correctly, might help hydroelectric production. 
  In some regions, change of streamflow timing from spring to winter may increase 
  hydropotential more in the winter than it reduces it in the spring and summer, 
  but there is a question of whether the electric system can take advantage of 
  the increase in winter flows and whether storage would be adequate. Hydroelectric 
  projects generally are designed for a specific river flow regime, including 
  a margin of safety. Projected climate changes are expected to change flow regimes-perhaps 
  outside these safety margins in some instances (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>). Although it is not yet possible to provide reliable forecasts of shifts 
  in flow regimes for world river systems as a consequences of climate change, 
  what is known suggests more intense rainfall events (which would require more 
  conservative water storage strategies to prevent flood damage), greater probability 
  of drought (less hydroelectric production), and less precipitation falling as 
  snow (less water available during warm months). All three factors point to less 
  (or, at least, less flexible) hydroelectric capacity at current powerhouses. 
  Reduced flows in rivers and higher temperatures reduce the capabilities of thermal 
  electric generation (Herrington et al., 1997); high temperatures also reduce 
  transmission capabilities. </p>
<p>Some advanced energy technologies also may be affected. For example, the United 
  States and Japan are trying to learn how to exploit the potential of methane 
  hydrates. If global warming leads to warmer oceans or warms areas that currently 
  are permafrost regions, these compounds are likely to become less stable, making 
  it more problematic to attempt to recover methane from them (Kripowicz, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Increased cloudiness can reduce solar energy production. Wind energy production 
  would be reduced if wind speeds increase above or fall below the acceptable 
  operating range of the technology. Changes in growing conditions could affect 
  the production of biomass, as well as prospects for carbon sequestration in 
  soils and forest resources. Climate change could worsen current trends in depletion 
  of biomass energy stocks in Africa, which is expected to become drier (see <a href="122.htm">Chapters 
  3</a> and <a href="377.htm">10</a>). The impact on biomass elsewhere is less 
  clear; it may include enhancement of growth because of higher rainfall in Africa 
  as well. </p>
<p>The portion of total energy supply from renewable energy sources varies among 
  countries, developed and developing. In the United States in 1998, renewable 
  sources provided roughly 7% of gross energy consumption-about half of that as 
  hydroelectric energy (EIA, 1999a). In other countries, developed and developing, 
  the percentages vary. For example, biomass accounts for 5% of north African, 
  15% of south African, and 86% of sub-Saharan (minus South Africa) energy consumption; 
  in Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and 
  Zambia, the vast majority of on-grid electricity generation comes from hydropower 
  (EIA, 1999b). Hydroelectricity represents the primary source of electricity 
  in Canada and most South and Central American countries, with the highest reliance 
  in Paraguay and Brazil (99 and 87% of generating capacity, respectively) (EIA, 
  1999c). Although renewable energy sources may be adaptable to new climate, larger 
  percentages of renewables (especially hydroelectricity) in a country's energy 
  supply might make the country relatively more sensitive to climate (see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 
  10</a>, <a href="411.htm">11</a>, and <a href="463.htm">12</a>). However, fossil 
  fuel extraction may be adversely affected by increased wind and wave action, 
  heavy precipitation, shoreline erosion, and permafrost melting in regions where 
  this applies (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 16</a>). In addition, thermal power 
  plants can be adversely affected by loss of cooling water as a result of low 
  flows (see <a href="463.htm">Chapter 12</a>). If a warmer climate is characterized 
  by more extreme weather events such as windstorms, ice storms, floods, tornadoes, 
  and hail, the transmission systems of electric utilities may experience a higher 
  rate of failure, with attendant costs (see, however, <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> and <a href="../wg1/373.htm">TAR WGI Chapter 10</a>) These failures can 
  be extremely costly, as illustrated by the great eastern Canada ice storm of 
  January 1998, which toppled hundreds of transmission towers and downed 120,000 
  km of power lines-in some cases for a month to 6 weeks-and cost CDN$3 billion 
  in economic damage (only half of which was insured) (Kerry et al., 1999). A 
  5-week power failure in the central business district of Auckland, New Zealand, 
  occurred in February-March 1998 when four high-voltage transmission cables failed 
  (Ministry of Commerce of New Zealand, 1998). Hot weather contributed to high 
  demand and less-than-optimal operating conditions of these cables as a result 
  of high soil temperature and dryness, although it was not ruled the direct cause. 
  Transmission and distribution systems can be hardened to respond to greater 
  risk, but only at substantial cost. </p>
<p>The SAR notes that on the demand side, space-cooling demand would increase 
  and space-heating demand would decrease. Electrical system expansion (generation, 
  transmission, and distribution) may be required to meet greater summer peaks. 
  In warmer areas, it is expected that the demand for electricity will certainly 
  increase, as may the demand for energy overall. Urbanization, rising incomes, 
  and warmer climates could combine to increase energy used for space cooling-already 
  a major concern in tropical and subtropical cities, most of which are in developing 
  countries (e.g., as much as 60% of total electricity use in the commercial sector 
  in Hong Kong, 60% of all electric energy in Riyadh-see Al-Rabghi et al., 1999; 
  Lam, 1999, 2000). Besides having a major impact on the energy sector, air conditioning 
  would tend to enhance heat island effects because of the energy used. At the 
  same time, research has found that air conditioning, where available and affordable, 
  is a statistically significant factor in reducing the chances of hot-weather-related 
  mortality (Chestnut et al., 1998). </p>
<p>The heat island phenomenon may have a positive impact in cities with seasonally 
  cool to cold winters. For example, during the 20th century, the long-term impact 
  of the urban heat island has been to reduce potential energy demand for space 
  heating by as much as 50% in the central quarters of megacities such as Tokyo 
  and Mexico City (Jáuregui, 1998). Urban warming and increased demand for cooling 
  is expected, even though urban aerosol production (e.g., from power plants) 
  does have a cooling effect (Science News, 1992; Jáuregui and Luyando, 1999). 
</p>
<p>Additional studies that have been published since the SAR continue to show 
  that whether net energy consumption will increase or decrease as a result of 
  climate change depends very much on location-in particular, whether energy consumption 
  includes larger heating loads or cooling loads. The north-south orientation 
  of Japan provides some insight into this question. Ichinose (1996) (quoted in 
  Mimura et al., 1998) has shown for Japan that reduction in heating would be 
  about 30% in Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido, whereas it would be 
  only 10% in Tokyo on the central island of Honshu. On the other hand, electricity 
  consumption for cooling would increase hardly at all on Honshu and several percent 
  in Naha on the southern island of Okinawa. The direction of net change also 
  is sensitive to the future market penetration of air conditioning and to energy 
  prices. In one Japanese study (Hattori et al., 1991, summarized in Mimura et 
  al., 1998) the sensitivity of peak electric power demand to air temperature 
  was shown to have increased 2.3 times during the 15 years between 1975 and 1990, 
  largely as a result of the increase in the market penetration and unit size 
  of air conditioners. Amano (1996, summarized in Mimura et al., 1998) points 
  out that a decline in energy prices contributed to the increase in the sensitivity 
  of electricity consumption to climate. </p>
<p>Belzer et al. (1996) is among the few studies since the SAR that has estimated 
  the effect of climate change on energy demand by the commercial sector. The 
  study projects the change in demand at the national level for the United States 
  in 2030. Accounting for changes in the building stock, a 4°C increase in average 
  annual temperature, holding other loads constant, leads to an estimated 0-5% 
  reduction in total energy consumption by the commercial sector in the year 2030 
  (note that 4°C was then considered possible at mid-latitudes if worldwide temperatures 
  increased 2.5°C; now it is probably at the upper end of potential increases). 
</p>
<p>The SAR notes that energy used for irrigation would increase. Peart et al. 
  (1995) studied the effects of climate change on energy efficiency in agriculture 
  (including irrigation) in the southeastern United States. Results indicate that 
  climate change would cause an increase in energy inputs required to produce 
  a given amount of maize, soybeans, and peanuts. </p>
<p>Only a handful of studies since the SAR have looked at the effects of climate 
  change on overall energy demand. Mendelsohn and Schlesinger (1999) estimated 
  climate response functions and economic welfare for the entire energy sector 
  in the United States, based on the cross-sectional study of household and firm 
  energy expenditures in Mendelsohn and Neumann (1998). Two approaches were used: 
  laboratory experiments coupled with process-based simulation models, and cross-sectional 
  studies to substitute for impacts of climate change over time. Economic welfare 
  associated with energy was found to have a quadratic relationship with temperature, 
  with a maximum at 10°C. Although the experimental method succeeded in isolating 
  the effect of climate from other variables, it failed to fully incorporate adaptive 
  responses. The cross-sectional studies found that annual energy expenditures 
  were minimized with an annual temperature of 12.8°C in the commercial energy 
  sector and with 11.7°C in the residential energy sector. The cross-sectional 
  approach, of course, does not allow for the transient response of the climate 
  system or the actual dynamics of the energy sector in response to climate. It 
  substitutes static history for a dynamic future and cannot deal with irreversibilities, 
  higher moments of climatic changes such as alterations to diurnal or seasonal 
  cycles, synergic responses (see <a href="318.htm">Section 7.6</a>), or extreme 
  events. (e.g., Schneider, 1997). </p>
