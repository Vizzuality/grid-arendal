<h3>2.6.3. Making Estimates</h3>
<h4><a name="2631"></a>2.6.3.1. Identifying Extreme Values, Ranges, and Thresholds</h4>
<p>It is worth noting that by failing to provide an estimate of the full range 
  of outcomes (i.e., not specifying outliers that include rapid nonlinear events), 
  authors of previous assessments were not conveying to potential users a representation 
  of the full range of uncertainty associated with the estimate. This has important 
  implications with regard to the extent to which the report accurately conveyed 
  to policymakers potential benefits or risks that may exist, even if at a low 
  or unknown probability (see <a href="104.htm#fig21">Figure 2-1</a>). If it were 
  necessary to truncate the range, it should have been clearly explained what 
  the provided range includes and/or excludes. Furthermore, the authors might 
  have specified how likely it is that the answer could lie outside the truncated 
  distribution.</p>
<p>Pittock and Jones (1999) recommend construction of thresholds that can be linked 
  to projected ranges of climate change. Such thresholds can account for biophysical 
  and/or socioeconomic criteria in the initial stages of an assessment but must 
  be expressed in climatic terms (e.g., above a certain temperature, rainfall 
  frequency, water balance, or combination of several factors). Further analysis 
  compares these thresholds with projected regional climate change. Similar approaches 
  are contained in concepts of tolerable climate change (see Hulme and Brown, 
  1998).</p>
<h4><a name="2632"></a>2.6.3.2. Valuation Issues</h4>
<p>Any comprehensive attempt to evaluate the societal value of climate change 
  should include, in addition to the usual monetary value of items or services 
  traded in markets, measures of valued items or services that are not easily 
  marketed. Schneider <i>et al</i>. (2000) refer to this costing problem in vulnerability 
  analysis as "The Five Numeraires": monetary loss, loss of human life, 
  reductions in quality of life (including forced migration, conflicts over environmentally 
  dependent resources, loss of cultural diversity, loss of cultural heritage sites, 
  etc.), loss of species/biodiversity, and increasing inequity in the distribution 
  of material well-being. There is little agreement on how to place a monetary 
  value on the nonmarket impacts of climate change, yet such valuation is essential 
  to several analytic techniques to assess the efficiency or cost-effectiveness 
  of alternative climate policy proposals (see <a href="102.htm">Section 2.5.6</a>).</p>
<p>One such technique for valuation is to survey expert opinion on subjective 
  assessment of probability distributions of climate damage estimates (see Nordhaus, 
  1994a; Morgan and Keith, 1995; Titus and Narayanan, 1996, for examples of decision 
  analytic elicitations of climate effects and impacts; see Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 
  1996, for examples of how such elicited subjective probability distributions 
  can be incorporated into IAMs that examine "optimal" policies). An 
  alternative valuation framework is to use "cultural theory" (Douglas 
  and Wildavsky, 1982) to identify different value perspectives in designing policy 
  strategies (see van Asselt and Rotmans, 1995, for an application to population 
  growth). With this technique, subjective judgment about uncertainties may be 
  described from the viewpoints of different cultural perspectives. Preferred 
  policy options depend on the perspective adopted. Real policy choice, of course, 
  depends on the logic and consistency of formulating a basis for policy choices 
  (i.e., the role of decision analysis tools) and on the values of decisionmakers 
  at all levels. More formal and explicit incorporation of uncertainties into 
  decision analysis is the emphasis here.</p>
