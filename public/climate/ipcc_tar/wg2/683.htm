<h2>19.7. Limitations of Methods and Directions for Future Research </h2>
<p>This section discusses the strengths and limitations of the analytic approaches 
  used to address the reasons for concern, mainly with regard to whether they 
  can, with the confidence levels given, indicate the severity of impact or risk 
  as a function of increase in global mean temperature. This discussion identifies 
  key uncertainties inherent in each method and offers directions for future research 
  that could improve our confidence in the results produced with each approach.</p>
<p>The organization of this section parallels that of the previous sections of 
  this chapter. The strengths, limitations, uncertainties, and directions for 
  each approach are discussed in the same order in which they were discussed in 
  the preceding sections. However, integrated assessment frameworks are considered 
  separately from aggregate approaches. Last is a discussion of integration across 
  methods and reasons for concern.</p>
<h3><a name="1971"></a>19.7.1. Observations</h3>
<p>Advantages: Because observations are based on observed effects rather than 
  models, they can be used to indicate whether climate change is causing impacts 
  and whether impacts lead to positive, negative, or indeterminate outcomes. They 
  also can be used to validate hypotheses and models that formalize hypotheses 
  on cause and effect.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: The problem with relying on observations to determine the severity 
  of impacts or risk from climate change is that there has been only 0.7&deg;C 
  of mean global warming over the past century (although some regions have experienced 
  much more warming). Because many impact thresholds may not be crossed until 
  greater magnitudes or rates of warming are reached, it is not clear how to interpret 
  an observed effect of warming or a group of such observations. Such observed 
  impacts to date often will be of only minor consequence, even though they may 
  tend to confirm our understanding of impact processes. Moreover, lack of observed 
  impacts may be simply because climate change has not yet reached critical thresholds 
  for such effects. Finally, attribution of causality is very difficult with observed 
  effects or groups of effects. One must be able to demonstrate that a regional 
  change in climate is a significant cause of an observed effect and that the 
  regional change in climate is linked to global climate change. </p>
<p>Uncertainties: Uncertainties include the magnitude of climate change that has 
  occurred, the extent to which impacts can be attributed to climate change that 
  has occurred, and whether the relationship between climate change and possible 
  impacts is linear or nonlinear and continuous or discontinuous.</p>
<p>Research Needs: For climate change impact detection to advance, there is a 
  need for continued, improved, and augmented data collection and further development 
  of analytical techniques. Geographical diversity is needed to balance the current 
  bias of study locations in North America and Europe; more observation studies 
  are needed in developing countries, with emphasis on those where physical, biological, 
  and socioeconomic systems have higher vulnerability to climate change (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>). </p>
<p>Because climate and impact systems are linked over a range of temporal scales, 
  longer time series of data allow better understanding of the relative magnitudes 
  of short- and long-term responses (Duarte et al., 1992; McGowan et al., 1999). 
  Large-amplitude temporal changes usually involve large spatial dimensions, so 
  broad-scale spatial/temporal studies are necessary as well. Satellite measurements 
  of the Earth's surface provide a very useful monitoring capability for 
  ocean, ecosystem, and land-cover changes. For example, satellite measurements 
  of the Earth's surface offer the potential for aggregation of observed 
  impacts with regard to broad-scale ecological responses such as vegetative responses 
  to increasing lengths of growing seasons (e.g., Myneni et al., 1997), complemented 
  by meteorological and vegetation data (e.g., Schwartz, 1998).</p>
<p>For ecosystem impacts, continuing observations are needed at sites where studies 
  already have been conducted, at long-term ecological research sites (e.g., Chapin 
  et al., 1995), and in protected areas. Programs that provide continued long-term 
  monitoring of marine and terrestrial environments also are important (Duarte 
  et al., 1992; Southward et al., 1995). Large-scale spatial/temporal ecosystem 
  studies are necessary because effects from local changes cannot be extrapolated 
  to large areas without evidence (McGowan et al., 1999; Parmesan et al., 1999). 
</p>
<p>Definition of indicator species or systems is a useful element of detection 
  studies (e.g., Beebee, 1995; Nehring, 1998; Cannell et al., 1999). Coupled with 
  monitoring programs, such data may then provide a consistent set of evidence 
  with which to study past, present, and future impacts of climate changes. </p>
<p>A further critical research need is to strengthen analytical tools for understanding 
  and evaluating observed climate change impacts. Robust meta-analyses of studies 
  that present good quality, multivariate data from a diversity of settings around 
  the world will help to define further the global coherence among impacts now 
  observed. Care also must be taken to ensure that the sample of studies is representative 
  across time and space, is not biased in its reporting, and uses appropriate 
  statistical tests. Also needed is development of methods to analyze differential 
  effects of climate across a range or sector. Individual and grouped studies 
  need to address possible correlations with competing explanations in a methodologically 
  rigorous manner. </p>
<p>Also needed are refinements in the fingerprint approach (e.g., Epstein et al., 
  1998), including more precise definition of expected changes and quantitative 
  measurement techniques, similar to that used in detection of climate changes 
  (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/439.htm">Chapter 12</a>). For climate, 
  fingerprint elements include warming in the mid-troposphere in the southern 
  hemisphere, a disproportionate rise in nighttime and winter temperatures, and 
  statistical increases in extreme weather events in many locations. These aspects 
  of climate change and climate variability have implications for ecological, 
  hydrological, and human systems that may be used to define a clear and robust 
  multidimensional "expected impact signal" to be tested in a range 
  of observations. A more refined and robust fingerprint approach may aid in the 
  study of difficult-to-detect, partially causal climate effects on socioeconomic 
  systems such as agriculture and health.</p>
<h3><a name="1972"></a>19.7.2. Studies of Unique and Threatened Systems</h3>
<p>Assessments of unique and threatened systems tend to be based on studies of 
  particular exposure units such as coral reefs, small islands, and individual 
  species.</p>
<p>Advantages: These studies contain richness of detail and involve many researchers, 
  often from developing and transition countries. In contrast to aggregate studies, 
  studies of exposure units can be used, at least in principle, to analyze distributional 
  effects by focusing on impacts on particular systems, species, regions, or demographic 
  groups. </p>
<p>Disadvantages: One of the main disadvantages is that exposure-unit studies 
  often are not carried out in a consistent manner. Exposure-unit studies often 
  examine related sectors in isolation and do not examine linkages or integration 
  among sectors and regions; for example, studies of the effects of climate change 
  on ecosystems or individual species often are conducted without examining the 
  potential effects of societal development on such systems. Local processes and 
  forces (e.g., urbanization, local air pollution) often can be more important 
  than global ones at the local scale, complicating the task of measuring the 
  influence of global climate change at the local scale.</p>
<p>Another key disadvantage is incompleteness of coverage. For example, in spite 
  of many and extensive country studies, there still are many gaps in coverage 
  in terms of countries, regions within countries, and unique and important potential 
  impacts that have not been assessed. The choice of exposure units may not necessarily 
  cover the most vulnerable systems. Topics such as impacts on biodiversity or 
  unique ecosystems often are not covered. There also has been little attention 
  to impacts on poor and disadvantaged members of society. Even where particular 
  critical exposure units have been covered, there may be just a single study. 
  Drawing conclusions with high confidence on the basis of one study may be inappropriate.</p>
<p>Uncertainties: Uncertainties include the likely magnitude of climate change 
  at the spatial resolution required by the study of the particular unique and 
  threatened system, masking of global change effects by nonclimate factors, the 
  degree of linearity/ nonlinearity in the relationship between stimulus and response, 
  and the degree to which results from individual studies can be extrapolated 
  or aggregated. </p>
<p>Research Needs: It would be desirable to have more studies of individual systems, 
  according to some set of priorities concerning the likely immediacy of the impacts. 
  Additional work on standardizing methods and reporting of results also would 
  be extremely useful. It also would be useful to devote more effort to integration 
  of results from existing studies. Again, it would be especially useful to increase 
  monitoring of changes in organisms, species, and systems that have limited range 
  now or are near their limits and to try to separate out or consider other causal 
  mechanisms such as local air pollution, loss of habitat, and competition from 
  invading pests and weeds.</p>
<h3><a name="1973"></a>19.7.3. Distributional Impacts</h3>
<p>Advantages: Distributional impact studies draw attention to likely heterogeneity 
  in impacts among different regions and social and economic groups. They also 
  help to identify and assess the situation of the "most vulnerable" 
  people and systems. Thus, such studies bring equity considerations to center 
  stage.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Distributional impact studies require regional climate change 
  projections and impact projections at the regional to local scale, where GCMs 
  may not be very accurate. They also require projections of demographics and 
  socioeconomic structure over a long time horizon. </p>
<p>Uncertainties: Research into the distribution of impacts of climate change 
  is recent (see <a href="673.htm">Section 19.4</a>). There are some findings 
  on which there is virtual unanimity. Some findings are broad conclusions&#151;such 
  as that more resource-constrained regions are likely to suffer more negative 
  impacts, as are people whose geographic location exposes them to the greatest 
  hazards from climate change. (Such people often live in regions with marginal 
  climate for food growing or in highly exposed coastal zones.) Others are more 
  specific but to date have been more conclusive with regard to the direction 
  of different impacts among regions, rather than the magnitudes. For example, 
  we know that impacts in developing low-latitude countries are more negative&#151;in 
  part because those countries tend to be operating at or above optimum temperatures 
  already&#151;and, in some cases, in regions where rainfall will decrease, leading 
  to water stress. There also is limited capacity for adaptation in these areas. 
  In some mid-latitude developed countries, agriculture would benefit initially 
  from warmer conditions and longer growing seasons. Beyond such sweeping statements, 
  uncertainties are vast. Resource constraints and (climatic) marginality are 
  multidimensional and complex phenomena. Currently, it is not known which components 
  of resource constraints or climatic marginality are more important or which 
  components may compensate for others or may have synergistic effects. There 
  are suggestions in other literature, but these have not been systematically 
  applied to the impacts of climate change, conceptually or empirically. </p>
<p>In sum, there is virtual consensus about the broad patterns. There is much 
  less knowledge about the details, although that situation is slowly improving. 
</p>
<p>Research Needs: Development of appropriate indicators of differences in regional 
  impacts and ways of comparing them across regions and socioeconomic groups would 
  be extremely useful. Improved methods for characterizing baseline demographics 
  and socioeconomic conditions in the absence of climate change or climate change-motivated 
  policies also would be useful. There is a need to quantify regional differences 
  and to develop estimates of the cost of inequity in monetary or other terms 
  (e.g., effect on poverty rates and trade, social and political instability, 
  and conflict). More accurate projections of regional climate change would increase 
  confidence in predictions of regional climate change impacts.</p>
