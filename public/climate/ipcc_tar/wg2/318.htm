<h2>7.6. Integration </h2>
<p>There are multiple pressures on human settlements that interact with climate 
  change. The discussion in this chapter shows that these other effects are more 
  important in the short run; climate is a potential player in the long run. For 
  example, urban population in the least-developed countries currently is growing 
  at about 5% yr<sup>-1</sup>, compared with 0.3% yr<sup>-1</sup> in highly industrialized 
  countries.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  Providing for this rapidly urbanizing population will be much higher on most 
  countries' agendas than longer term issues with climate change. </p>
<p>Other environmental problems will tend to interact with climate change, adversely 
  affecting human settlements. For example, 25-90% of domestic energy supply in 
  the developing world is met by biomass resources, especially in small urban 
  centers (Barnes et al., 1998). In some countries, 11-20% of all deforestation 
  may be attributable to charcoal production (Ribot, 1993), much of it to meet 
  urban needs. If biomass growth is slowed via climate change effects, the impacts 
  on biomass may be compounded. </p>
<p>Deforestation and cultivation of marginal lands can compound the effects of 
  extreme events. For example, floods resulting from Hurricane Mitch, though not 
  caused by climate change, illustrate the fact that poor watershed management 
  can contribute to flooding and landslides-which, in turn, causes loss of life 
  and destroys infrastructure and the means of livelihood. Mitch cost Honduras 
  80% and Nicaragua 49% of one year's GDP (FAO, 1999). Poor watershed management 
  and technical failures has contributed to loss of life in landslides in Sri 
  Lanka, Peru, Brazil, several European countries, and the United States (Katupotha, 
  1994) </p>
<p>Urban water resources already are in extremely short supply in 19 Middle Eastern 
  and African countries (IPCC, 1998) and in cities in many parts of the world, 
  where as many as 60% of poorer residents may not have access to reliable water 
  supplies (Foronda, 1998). Poor urban water management may be responsible for 
  losses through leakage of 20-50% in cities in the developing world and even 
  in some cities in the industrialized world (WRI, 1996). If climate change makes 
  water more scarce-by increasing demand (even in regions that currently are not 
  particularly short of water, such as Great Britain-see Arnell, 1998) or by reducing 
  supply (reduced surface runoff, exacerbation of water quality problems as a 
  result of warmer temperatures and reduced flows, or salinization of coastal 
  aquifers resulting from sea-level rise)-water supply problems would be exacerbated. 
</p>
<p>Liquid waste disposal is a significant problem in urban areas as diverse as 
  Chimbote, Peru (Foronda, 1998); Buenos Aires, Argentina (Pirez, 1998); Cotonou, 
  Benin (Dedehouanou, 1998); and Chicago, USA (Changnon and Glantz, 1996). There 
  are two ways in which climate could interact with this problem: reductions in 
  supplies of water with which wastes are diluted and the impact of more severe 
  flooding episodes that overtop sewer systems and treatment plants (Walsh and 
  Pittock, 1998). Where most inhabitants rely on pit latrines and wells, flooding 
  spreads excreta from pit latrines everywhere and contaminates wells (Boko, 1991, 
  1993, 1994). Land-use changes associated with urbanization also have reduced 
  the absorptive capacity of many river basins, increasing the ratio of runoff 
  to precipitation and making flooding more likely (Changnon and Demissie, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Large urban areas, especially in the developed world, depend on extended "linkage 
  systems" for their viability (Timmerman and White, 1997; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 
  2000). They depend on imports from the local area, region, nation, and even 
  the world for everything from raw material and food, to product and waste exports 
  and communications. These linkage systems often are vulnerable to severe storms, 
  floods, and other severe weather events. Management, redundancy, and robustness 
  of these interlocking systems is a top priority for developed world settlements 
  especially, but increasingly so for the developing world (Timmerman and White, 
  1997). </p>
<h3> <a name="761"></a>7.6.1. Key Vulnerabilities </h3>
<p>Key climate-related sensitivities in urban areas of the world include water 
  supply and the effects of extreme events (primarily flooding) on infrastructure 
  in river floodplains and coastal zones. These areas should be considered sensitive 
  to climate change. To the extent that sensitive settlements coincide with conditions 
  of poverty and lack of technical infrastructure, these settlements also will 
  be particularly vulnerable to climate change. </p>
<h3> <a name="762"></a>7.6.2. Potential for Nonlinear Interactions and Synergistic 
  Effects </h3>
<p>Because of their role as centers for administration and commerce, urban areas 
  integrate all of the environmental effects that visit a society and to some 
  extent buffer their human occupants from natural environmental fluctuations. 
  However, these urban areas still may be affected by several stresses that interact 
  with each other in a nonlinear fashion (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2000; Wilbanks 
  and Wilkinson, 2001). Whatever cash economy there is in a country tends to reside 
  in its biggest cities, and trade routes also focus on these areas. These are 
  two very important coping mechanisms. Thus, for example, climate-related food 
  shortages are more likely to be experienced in urban areas as an increase in 
  migrants from the countryside or loss of business in agriculture-related business 
  rather than as famine per se. </p>
<p>Once populations are housed in urban settlements, there are other potential 
  interactions among climate effects that lead to nonlinear impacts on them. Flooding 
  events that are beyond the designed capacity of settlement infrastructure are 
  a case in point, especially in cases in which systems already may be degraded. 
  Urban flooding can overwhelm sewage treatment systems, thereby increasing the 
  risk of disease at the same time that water treatment systems are compromised, 
  health services are disrupted, disease vector species are driven into close 
  contact with people, and people are exposed to the elements because of lost 
  housing. Outbreaks of epidemics are always a risk under such circumstances, 
  whereas the breakdown of any single one of the affected systems might be merely 
  inconvenient. Although all of these effects and mechanisms are well understood, 
  however, it is not possible to predict impacts quantitatively at this time. 
</p>
<p><a href="319.htm#tab73">Table 7-3</a> shows the primary synergistic effects 
  between climate-related factors that may affect human settlements and the primary 
  types of settlements or industries affected. Each cell identifies a synergistic 
  effect between the climate impact featured in the row and another effect shown 
  in the column. For example, climate-related impacts of flooding, landslides, 
  and fire are compounded when they occur in settlements that also might be crowded 
  by migration. Likewise, flooding in particular exacerbates water pollution and 
  human health impacts and probably would compound problems in obtaining drinking 
  water and transportation. In addition, the agricultural base and energy supplies 
  could be affected in regions that already are water-deficient. </p>
<p>Air and water pollution effects of climate change would be worse if the health 
  of human populations already is compromised (e.g., asthma attacks may be more 
  severe or prolonged in a weakened population). Charlot-Valdieu et al. (1999) 
  argue for reducing some stresses in a multiple-stress context to handle other 
  stresses in a more sustainable manner. </p>
<p>Access to energy, clean water, sanitation, and selected other resources is 
  essential to maintain human settlements and the health of the populations within. 
  Flooding, landslides, or fire resulting from extreme weather could compound 
  the shortage of resources by destroying critical infrastructure (floods in Honduras 
  in 1998 and Mozambique in 2000 are examples of the phenomenon under current 
  climate) and, in the case of water, polluting the sources. Similarly, water 
  pollution reduces the effective water supply by making some sources unusable.</p>
