<h2>5.3. Agriculture</h2>
<p>Conclusions regarding the consequences of climate change for the agriculture 
  sector in the SAR (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 1996) provide an important benchmark 
  for this section. The focus in this section is on basic mechanisms and processes 
  that regulate the sensitivity of agriculture to climate change, relying mostly 
  on research results since the SAR. Specifically, we ask how the conclusions 
  of the SAR have stood the test of new research. Research advances since the 
  SAR have brought several new issues to light&#151;for example, understanding 
  the adaptation of agriculture to climate change.</p>
<p>The discussion in this section is guided by the State-Pressure-Impact-Response-Adaptation 
  model (see <a href="203.htm#fig51">Figure 5-1</a>). The pace of social, economic, 
  and technological change in the agriculture sector will steadily transform the 
  setting in which climate change is likely to interact with sensitive features 
  of the food system. The current state of the sector and important trends that 
  would transform it provide a baseline against which to examine the potential 
  consequences of climate change (<a href="208.htm#531">Section 5.3.1</a>). Multiple 
  pressures are being exerted on the agriculture sector, including the need to 
  meet rising demand for food and fiber, resource degradation, and a variety of 
  environmental changes (<a href="209.htm">Section 5.3.2</a>). Agricultural impacts, 
  response, and adaptation are discussed concurrently because they are inseparable 
  parts of the calculus of the vulnerability of agricultural systems to climate 
  change. Hence, we consider the response and adaptive potential of agriculture 
  in each of the succeeding sections. Agriculture is likely to respond initially 
  to climate change through a series of automatic mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms 
  are biological; others are routine adjustments by farmers and markets. Note 
  that we equate response with automatic adaptation, as discussed in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change will impact agriculture by causing damage and gain at scales 
  ranging from individual plants or animals to global trade networks. At the plant 
  or field scale, climate change is likely to interact with rising CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations and other environmental changes to affect crop and animal physiology 
  (<a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>). Impacts and adaptation (agronomic 
  and economic) are likely to extend to the farm and surrounding regional scales 
  (<a href="213.htm#534">Section 5.3.4</a>). Important new work also models agricultural 
  impacts and adaptation in a global economy (<a href="216.htm">Section 5.3.5</a>). 
  Finally, the vulnerabilities of the agriculture sector, which persist after 
  taking account of adaptation, are assessed (<a href="216.htm#536">Section 5.3.6</a>).<br>
</p>
<h3> <a name="531"></a>5.3.1. State of the Global Agricultural Sector</h3>
<p>As Reilly <i>et al</i>. (1996) argue in the SAR, one of the foremost goals 
  for global agriculture in coming decades will be expansion of the global capacity 
  of food and fiber in step with expansion of global demand. Agriculture in the 
  20th century accomplished the remarkable achievement of increasing food supply 
  at a faster rate than growth in demand, despite rapidly growing populations 
  and per capita incomes. Key summary indicators of the balance between global 
  demand and supply are world prices for food and feed grains. Johnson (1999) 
  and Antle <i>et al</i>. (1999a) show that during the second half of the 20th 
  century, real (inflation-adjusted) prices of wheat and feed corn have declined 
  at an average annual rate of 1-3%. Climate change aside, several recent 
  studies (World Bank, 1993; Alexandratos, 1995; Rosegrant <i>et al</i>., 1995; 
  Antle <i>et al</i>., 1999a; Johnson, 1999) anticipate that aggregate food production 
  is likely to keep pace with demand, so that real food prices will be stable 
  or slowly declining during the first 2 decades of the 21st century. </p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1999), food security<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> 
  has improved globally, leading to a decline in the total number of people without 
  access to adequate food. The declining real price of food grains has greatly 
  improved the food security of the majority of the world's poor, who spend a 
  large share of their incomes on these staples. The global number, however, masks 
  variation in food security among regions, countries, and social groups that 
  are vulnerable because of low incomes or a lack of access to food (FAO, 1999a). 
  In lower income countries, political instability and inadequate physical and 
  financial resources are the root causes of the food security problem (see <a href="216.htm#536">Section 
  5.3.6</a>). In higher income, developing countries, food insecurity stems from 
  unequal distribution of food that results from wide disparities in purchasing 
  power.<br>
  <br>
  Agricultural production and trade policies also affect global food availability 
  and food security. There is a widespread tendency for high-income countries 
  to maintain policies that effectively subsidize agricultural production, whereas 
  low-income countries generally have policies that tax or discourage agricultural 
  production (Schiff and Valdez, 1996). Many low-income countries also pursue 
  policies that promote food self-sufficiency. Although all of these policies 
  tend to reduce the efficiency of agricultural resource utilization in low- and 
  high-income countries, they have not changed long-run trends in global supply 
  and demand (Antle, 1996a).<br>
</p>
<p>Relatively few studies have attempted to predict likely paths for food demand 
  and supply beyond 2020. There are reasons for optimism that growth in food supply 
  is likely to continue apace with demand beyond 2020. For example, population 
  growth rates are projected to decline into the 21st century (Bos <i>et al</i>., 
  1994; Lutz <i>et al</i>., 1996; United Nations, 1996), and multiple lines of 
  evidence suggest that agricultural productivity potential is likely to continue 
  to increase. Rosegrant and Ringler (1997) project that current and future expected 
  yields will remain below theoretical maximums for the foreseeable future, implying 
  opportunities for further productivity growth. <br>
</p>
<p> <br>
  Other analysts are less optimistic about long-term world food prospects. For 
  example, there is evidence that the Asian rice monoculture may be reaching productivity 
  limits because of adverse impacts on soils and water (Pingali, 1994). Tweeten 
  (1998) argues that extrapolation of the downward trend in real food prices observed 
  in the latter half of the 20th century could be erroneous because the supply 
  of the best arable land is being exhausted and rates of productivity growth 
  are declining. At the same time, demand is likely to continue to grow at reasonably 
  high rates well into the 21st century. Other studies indicate concerns about 
  declining rates of investment in agricultural productivity and their impacts 
  on world food production in some major producing and consuming areas (Hayami 
  and Otsuka, 1994; Rozelle and Huang, 1999). Ruttan (1996) indicates that despite 
  advances in biotechnology, most yield improvements during the first decades 
  of the 21st century are likely to continue to come from conventional plant and 
  animal breeding techniques. These concerns about future productivity growth, 
  if correct, mean that simple extrapolation of yield for impact assessment (e.g., 
  Alexandratos, 1995) may be overoptimistic. The implication is that confidence 
  in predictions of the world food demand and supply balance and price trends 
  beyond the early part of the 21st century is low.<br>

        <p><b>Box 5-3. Impacts of Climate Change and Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on 
          Grain and Forage Quality from Experimentation</b></p>
        <p align="left">The importance of climate change impacts on grain and 
          forage quality emerges from new research. For rice, the amylose content 
          of the grain&#151;a major determinant of cooking quality&#151;is increased 
          under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Conroy <i>et al</i>., 1994). Cooked rice 
          grain from plants grown in high-CO<sub>2</sub> environments would be 
          firmer than that from today's plants. However, concentrations of 
          iron and zinc, which are important for human nutrition, would be lower 
          (Seneweera and Conroy, 1997). Moreover, the protein content of the grain 
          decreases under combined increases of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> 
          (Ziska <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
        <p align="left">With wheat, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> reduces the protein 
          content of grain and flour by 9-13% (Hocking and Meyer, 1991; Conroy 
          <i>et al</i>., 1994; Rogers <i>et al</i>., 1996a). Grain grown at high 
          CO<sub>2</sub> produces poorer dough of lower extensibility and decreased 
          loaf volume (Blumentahl <i>et al</i>., 1996), but the physiochemical 
          properties of wheat starch during grain fill are not significantly modified 
          (Tester <i>et al</i>., 1995). Increases in daily average temperatures 
          above 30&deg;C, even applied for periods of up to 3 days, tend to decrease 
          dough strength (Randall and Moss, 1990). Hence, for breadmaking, the 
          quality of flour produced from wheat grain developed at high temperatures 
          and in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> degrades. <br>
          <br>
          With high-quality grass species for ruminants, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature 
          increase have only minor impacts on digestibility and fiber composition 
          of cut material (Akin <i>et al</i>., 1995; Soussana <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
          The large increase in water-soluble carbohydrates in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
          (Casella and Soussana, 1997) could lead to faster digestion in the rumen, 
          whereas declines in nitrogen concentration occurring mainly with C<sub>3</sub> 
          species (Owensby <i>et al</i>., 1994; Soussana <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
          Read <i>et al</i>., 1997) reduce the protein value of the forage. The 
          protein-to-energy ratio has been shown to be more critical in tropical 
          climates than in temperate countries (Leng, 1990). Livestock that graze 
          low protein-containing rangeland forage therefore may be more detrimentally 
          affected by increased C:N ratios than energy-limited livestock that 
          graze protein-rich pastures (Gregory <i>et al</i>., 1999). Basically, 
          lowering of the protein-to-energy ratio in forage could reduce the availability 
          of microbial protein to ruminants for growth and production, leading 
          to more inefficient utilization of the feed base and more waste, including 
          emissions of methane. </p>
