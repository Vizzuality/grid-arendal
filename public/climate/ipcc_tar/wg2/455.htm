<h4>11.3.2.2. Arid and Semi-Arid Asia </h4>
<p>The major impact of climate change in arid and semi-arid Asia is likely to 
  be an acute shortage of water resources associated with significant increases 
  in surface air temperature. Conservation of water used for irrigated agriculture 
  therefore should be given priority attention. With increased evapotranspiration, 
  any adaptation strategy in agriculture should be oriented toward a shift from 
  conventional crops to types of agriculture that are not vulnerable to evapotranspiration 
  (Safriel, 1995). These strategies entail either intensive agriculture in greenhouses&#151;within 
  which rates of evapotranspiration are much reduced&#151;or developing alternatives 
  such as aquaculture that will partly replace agriculture (e.g., fish for human/animal 
  feed, crustaceans for human feed, and unicellular algae for fish/prawn feed, 
  as well as for food additives and medicinal and cosmetic uses). All of these 
  organisms are of high yield; they enjoy solar radiation and often heat, and 
  they do not evaporate or transpire water. Expansion of commercial and artesian 
  fisheries also could help reduce dependence on food productivity. Protection 
  of soils from degradation should be given serious consideration.</p>
<p>Climate change would exacerbate threats to biodiversity resulting from land-use/cover 
  change and population pressure in Asia. Ecosystem services can be impaired by 
  loss of key species in arid and semi-arid Asia (Xiao et al., 1998). Because 
  intraspecies variation in response to environmental stress usually exists in 
  populations subjected to year-to-year climate change, some genotypes in such 
  populations are expected to be more resistant to climate change than others. 
  Such genotypes are more common in peripheral populations than in core populations 
  of species. Although the core population may become extinct because of global 
  warming, resistant types in peripheral populations will survive and can be used 
  to rehabilitate and restore affected ecosystems (Safriel et al., 1994; Kark 
  et al., 1999). The geographic locations of the peripheral species population 
  usually coincide with climatic transition zones, such as at the edges of drylands 
  or along the transition between different types of drylands. Many countries 
  in the region have more than one dryland type and hence should have peripheral 
  populations&#151;especially in desert and nondesert transitions, which often 
  occur within semi-arid drylands. Identifying regions with concentrations of 
  peripheral populations of species of interest and protecting their habitats 
  from being lost to development therefore can play a role in enhancing planned 
  adaptation for natural and semi-natural ecosystems. </p>
