<h3>19.1.3. Role of Adaptation </h3>
<p>Successful adaptation reduces vulnerability to an extent that depends greatly 
  on adaptive capacity&#151;the ability of an affected system, region, or community 
  to cope with the impacts and risks of climate change (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>). Enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce vulnerability and promote 
  sustainable development across many dimensions. </p>
<p>Adaptive capacity in human systems varies considerably among regions, countries, 
  and socioeconomic groups. The ability to adapt to and cope with climate change 
  impacts is a function of wealth, technology, information, skills, infrastructure, 
  institutions, equity, empowerment, and ability to spread risk. Groups and regions 
  with adaptive capacity that is limited along any of these dimensions are more 
  vulnerable to climate change damages, just as they are more vulnerable to other 
  stresses. Enhancement of adaptive capacity is a necessary condition for reducing 
  vulnerability, particularly for the most vulnerable regions, nations, and socioeconomic 
  groups. To be sure, some development paths can increase some types of vulnerabilities, 
  whereas others can reduce those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Adaptive capacity in natural systems tends to be more limited than adaptive 
  capacity in human systems. Many species have limited ability to migrate or change 
  behavior in response to climate change. What may be of greater concern is the 
  harm that already has been done to natural systems by societal development. 
  Habitat fragmentation and destruction, as well as creation of barriers to migration, 
  will make it much more difficult for species to cope with climate change than 
  if natural systems were undisturbed. </p>
<p>We do not address adaptation explicitly in this chapter, except to the extent 
  that the literature cited here considers adaptation. Adaptation may have the 
  potential to reduce vulnerability and, in many cases, shift the threshold for 
  negative impacts to higher magnitudes of climate change. The degree to which 
  adaptation can do so is not addressed here; it should be the subject of future 
  research.</p>

            <b>Figure 19-1:</b> Global mean temperature change (from 1990) as 
            a function of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for SRES scenarios. For 
            any given CO<sub>2</sub> level, uncertainties in temperature arise 
            through several factors. The three most important are accounted for 
            here: First, different temperatures for a given future CO<sub>2</sub> 
            level may arise because each emissions scenario has different levels 
            of other GHGs and different levels of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions&#151;factors 
            that lead to a range of possible non-CO<sub>2</sub> forcings (results 
            here consider all six SRES illustrative scenarios); second, different 
            temperatures arise because of uncertainties in climate sensitivity 
            (three values&#151;1.5, 2.5, and 4.5&ordm;C equilibrium warming for 
            a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling&#151;are used here); and third, different 
            temperatures arise because different rates of radiative forcing change 
            and different climate sensitivities lead to different levels of damping 
            of the instantaneous equilibrium response. </td>

      <p><a name="fig191"></a>Does a given atmospheric concentration of GHGs cause 
        a specific change in global mean temperature (or other climate variables, 
        for that matter)? To answer this question, we quantify uncertainties in 
        the change in global mean temperature for a given CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
        level. This is accomplished by using the same simple models that are used 
        in the TAR Working Group I report (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 
        9</a>). These models are updated versions of models used previously by 
        the IPCC in the Second Assessment Report (SAR) (Kattenberg et al., 1996; 
        see also Raper et al., 1996). We consider the effects of uncertainties 
        in future emissions of all radiatively important gases (particularly the 
        relative importance of CO<sub>2</sub> to other forcing factors) and climate 
        sensitivity, but not uncertainties in translating emissions to concentrations.</p>
      <p>These uncertainty issues are addressed by comparing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
        (not other GHGs) and the corresponding temperature projections for 5-year 
        time steps from 1990 to 2100 (i.e., using results for 1995, 2000, 2005, 
        etc.) for the six illustrative emissions scenarios from the IPCC Special 
        Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakicenovic et al., 2000) under 
        a range of climate sensitivity assumptions. The six emissions scenarios 
        provide a sampling of the space of the relative effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        compared with other GHGs and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)-derived sulfate 
        aerosols. Climate sensitivity (<sup>3</sup>T2x) values of 1.5, 2.5, and 
        4.5&deg;C are used.</p>
      <p>The results are plotted as a simple scatter diagram of temperature change 
        against CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (see <a href="#fig191">Figure 19-1</a>). 
        The scatter plot has 22 5-year values (1990 values are zero in each case) 
        by six scenarios by three sensitivities (396 points). The diagram is meant 
        only to illustrate a range of possibilities. One cannot associate any 
        specific confidence intervals with the ranges shown; however, simultaneous 
        use of realistic values in several input parameters with the judgment 
        that the climate sensitivity range of 1.5-4.5&deg;C represents approximately 
        the 90% confidence interval (see, e.g., Morgan and Keith, 1995) suggests 
        that the probability of a result outside the ranges shown, during the 
        interval 1990-2100, is less than 10%.</p>
      <p>The results are shown in <a href="#fig191">Figure 19-1</a>. For example, 
        for a future CO<sub>2</sub> level of 550 ppmv, the global mean warming 
        range is 1-3&deg;C relative to 1990. Thus, a specific CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentration could lead to a range of increases in global mean temperature. 
        Note that this is a transient result; in other words, if CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentrations were stabilized at 550 ppmv, substantial additional warming 
        would occur beyond this range as the climate system slowly relaxed toward 
        a new equilibrium state. The levels of increase in global mean temperature 
        displayed in the diagram are less than what would eventually happen if 
        CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were stabilized at a particular level. Note 
        also that there is no time (or date) associated with any particular concentration 
        level. For, example, in the SRES scenarios, 550 ppmv is reached at a range 
        of dates from about 2050 onward.</p>
