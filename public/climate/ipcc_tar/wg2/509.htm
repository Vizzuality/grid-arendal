<h3>13.3.4. Agriculture </h3>
<p>To avoid or at least reduce negative effects and exploit possible positive 
  effects, several economic and agronomic adaptation strategies for agriculture 
  have been suggested. Economic strategies are intended to render the agricultural 
  costs of climate change small by comparison with overall expansion of agricultural 
  products. Agronomic strategies intend to offset the loss of productivity caused 
  by climate change, either partially or completely. Agronomic strategies include 
  short-term adjustments and long-term adaptations. </p>
<h4><a name="13341"></a>13.3.4.1. Short-Term Adjustments </h4>
<p>Short-term adjustments to climate change are efforts to optimize production 
  with major system changes. They are autonomous in the sense that no other sectors 
  (e.g., policy, research) are needed for their development and implementation. 
  Thus, short-term adjustment can be considered the first defense tool against 
  climate change. A large range of such adjustments have been reported, including: 
</p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> Changes in planting dates and cultivars: For spring crops, climate warming 
    will allow earlier planting or sowing than at present. Crops that are planted 
    earlier are more likely to have already matured when extreme high temperatures, 
    such as in the middle of summer, can cause injury. Earlier planting in spring 
    increases the length of the growing season; thus, earlier planting and use 
    of long-season cultivars will increase yield potential, provided moisture 
    is adequate and the risk of heat damage is low. Otherwise, earlier planting 
    combined with a short-season cultivar would give the best assurance of avoiding 
    heat and water stresses. Deeper planting of seeds also will contribute to 
    making seed germination more likely. For winter crops (i.e., cereals), this 
    approach may cause problems because their cycle length often is linked with 
    cold temperature requirements (vernalization) that may not be completely fulfilled 
    during warmer winters. Late cultivars also may not be able to escape heat 
    and drought risks in the summer. Winter cereals must have a specific growth 
    stage before the onset of winter to ensure winter survival, and they often 
    are sown when temperatures approach the time when vernalization is most effective 
    (Harrison and Butterfield, 1996). This may mean later sowings in northern 
    Europe under climatic warming. 
  <li> Changes in external inputs: External inputs are used to optimize production 
    of crops in terms of productivity and profitability. The use of fertilizers 
    generally is adjusted to fit the removal of nutrients by the crop and any 
    losses of nutrients that may occur during or between growing seasons. A change 
    in yield level therefore, all other things being equal, will imply a corresponding 
    change in fertilizer inputs. Projected increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentration will cause a large nitrogen uptake by the crop and thus larger 
    fertilizer applications. On the other hand, climatic constraints on yields 
    may lead to less demand for fertilizers. Changes in climate also may cause 
    larger (or smaller) losses of nitrogen through leaching or gaseous losses. 
    This also may lead to changes in the demand for fertilizer. Global warming 
    will lead to a higher incidence of weeds, pests, and diseases in many areas 
    and thus to potentially increased use of chemical control measures (e.g., 
    pesticides). These inputs can be kept low through adoption of integrated pest 
    management systems, which adjust control measures to the observed problem 
    and also take a range of influencing factors (including weather) into account. 
    Current fertilizer and pesticide practices are based partly on models and 
    partly on empirical functions obtained in field experiments. These models 
    and functions are updated regularly with new experimental evidence. This process 
    probably will capture the response of changes in the environment through CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and climate. It is important, however, that agricultural researchers and advisors 
    are aware of the possible impact of global change on the use of external inputs, 
    so that older empirical data are used with proper caution. 
  <li> Practices to conserve moisture: Several water-conserving practices are 
    commonly used to combat drought. These also may be used to reduce climate 
    change impacts (Easterling, 1996). Such practices include conservation tillage 
    and irrigation management. Conservation tillage (the practice of leaving some 
    of the previous season's crop residues on the soil surface) may protect the 
    soil from wind and water erosion and retain moisture by reducing evaporation 
    and increasing infiltration of precipitation into the soil. Irrigation management 
    can be used to improve considerably the utilization of applied water through 
    proper timing of the amount of water distributed. For example, with irrigation 
    scheduling practices, water is applied only when the crop needs it. This tunes 
    the proper timing and amount of water to actual field conditions, allowing 
    a reduction in water use as well as the cost of production.
