<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This volume, Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, is 
  the Working Group II (WGII) contribution to the Third Assessment Report (TAR) 
  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The companion volumes 
  of the TAR are Climate Change 2001: the Scientific Basis (WGI) and Climate Change 
  2001: Mitigation (WGIII). A fourth volume of the TAR is being prepared to provide 
  a synthesis of the findings of the three Working Groups and will focus on questions 
  addressing particular policy issues raised in the context of the Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change.<br>
</p>
<p>Since the inception of the IPCC, its Working Group II has focused on the impacts 
  of projected climate change. The current WGII report differs somewhat in scope 
  from earlier WGII assessments. This report examines climate change impacts, 
  adaptation, and vulnerability across a range of systems and sectors, as was 
  done in the Second Assessment Report (SAR, published in 1996), and includes 
  a regional assessment, updated from the Special Report on Regional Impacts of 
  Climate Change (1998). Environmental, social, and economic dimensions of these 
  issues are assessed in this report, whereas the previous WGII report focused 
  primarily on environmental dimensions. Efforts are made in the new assessment 
  to address a number of issues that cut across the various sectors and systems 
  covered by the WGII report, as well as across the three Working Groups of IPCC, 
  such as sustainable development, equity, scientific uncertainties, costing methodologies, 
  and decisionmaking frameworks. Mitigation of climate change, treated in previous 
  WGII reports, is now the subject of WGIII's contribution to the TAR. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Research on climate impacts has grown considerably since the SAR, and much 
  has been learned in the past 5 years regarding the potential risk of damage 
  associated with projected climate change. The research has added to what we 
  know about the vulnerabilities to climate change of a wide range of ecological 
  systems (forests, grasslands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and marine environments) 
  and human systems (agriculture, water resources, coastal resources, human health, 
  financial institutions, and human settlements).<br>
</p>
<p>Observational evidence of changes has accumulated in many physical and biological 
  systems (e.g., glacial melting, shifts in geographic ranges of plant and animal 
  species, and changes in plant and animal biology) that are highly consistent 
  with warming observed in recent decades. These observations are adding to our 
  knowledge of the sensitivity of affected systems to changes in climate and can 
  help us to understand the vulnerability of systems to the greater and more rapid 
  climate changes projected for the 21st century. A number of unique systems are 
  increasingly recognized as especially vulnerable to climate change (e.g., glaciers, 
  coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine 
  ecosystems, prairie wetlands, and remnant native grasslands). In addition, climate 
  change is expected to threaten some species with greater probability of extinction. 
  Potential changes in the frequency, intensity, and persistence of climate extremes 
  (e.g. heat waves, heavy precipitation, and drought) and in climate variability 
  [e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] are emerging as key determinants 
  of future impacts and vulnerability. The many interactions of climate change 
  with other stresses on the environment and human populations, as well as linkages 
  between climate change and sustainable development, are increasingly emphasized 
  in recent research and preliminary insights from these important efforts are 
  reflected in the report.<br>
</p>
<p>The value of adaptation measures to diminish the risk of damage from future 
  climate change, and from present climate variability, was recognized in previous 
  assessments and is confirmed and expanded upon in the new assessment. Understanding 
  of the determinants of adaptive capacity has advanced and confirms the conclusion 
  that developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, have 
  lesser capacity to adapt than do developed countries. This condition contributes 
  to relatively high vulnerability to damaging effects of climate change in these 
  countries. <br>
</p>
<p>The WGII report was compiled by 183 Lead Authors between July 1998 and February 
  2001. In addition, 243 Contributing Authors submitted draft text and information 
  to the Lead Author teams. Drafts of the report were circulated twice for review, 
  first to experts and a second time to both experts and governments. Comments 
  received from 440 reviewers were carefully analyzed and assimilated to revise 
  the document with guidance provided by 33 Review Editors. The revised report 
  was presented for consideration at a session of the Working Group II panel held 
  in Geneva from 13 to 16 February 2001, in which delegates from 100 countries 
  participated. There, the <a href="005.htm">Summary for Policymakers</a> was 
  approved in detail and the full report accepted.<br>
</p>
<p>This report contains a <a href="005.htm">Summary for Policymakers</a> (SPM) 
  and a <a href="021.htm">Technical Summary</a> (TS) in addition to the 19 chapters 
  comprising the full report. Each paragraph of the SPM has been referenced to 
  the supporting sections of the TS. In turn, each paragraph of the TS has been 
  referenced to the appropriate section of the relevant chapter. The first three 
  chapters set the stage for the report by discussing the context of climate change, 
  methods for research and assessment, and development of scenarios. Chapters 
  4 through 9 assess the state of knowledge regarding climate change impacts, 
  adaptation, and vulnerability for different natural and human systems or sectors. 
  <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a> through <a href="619.htm">17</a> assess vulnerabilities 
  and key concerns of eight regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Australia/New 
  Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, polar regions, and small island 
  states. <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a> presents a synthesis of adaptation 
  challenges, options, and capacity. <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a> concludes 
  the report with a synthesis of climate change risks for unique and threatened 
  systems, extreme climate events, uneven distribution of impacts, global aggregate 
  impacts, and large-scale high-impact events. An electronic version of the report 
  that can be searched for key words will be available on the web (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipcc.ch">http://www.ipcc.ch</a>) 
  and CD-ROM.<br>
</p>
<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to all the Coordinating Lead Authors, 
  Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review Editors, and expert and government 
  reviewers, without whose expertise, diligence, and patience and considerable 
  investments of uncompensated time a report of this quality could never have 
  been completed. We would also like to thank members of the Working Group II 
  Bureau for their assistance throughout the preparation of the report.<br>
</p>
<p>We would particularly like to thank Neil Leary, who headed the WGII Technical 
  Support Unit, and his staff, Dave Dokken, Kasey Shewey White, Sandy MacCracken, 
  and Florence Ormond. Their tireless and very capable efforts to coordinate the 
  WGII assessment ensured a final product of high scientific quality. In addition 
  we thank Richard Moss for his invaluable contributions to the early planning 
  phase of this work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank Narasimhan Sundararaman, the Secretary of IPCC; 
  Renate Christ, Deputy Secretary; and the staff of the IPCC Secretariat, Rudie 
  Bourgeois, Chantal Ettori and Annie Courtin who provided logistical support 
  for government liaison and travel of experts from the developing and transitional 
  economy countries.<br>
