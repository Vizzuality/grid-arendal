<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Mathematical models indicate that climate change scenarios over the coming 
  century would modestly increase the proportion of world population living in 
  regions of potential transmission of malaria and dengue (medium to high confidence). 
  These models are limited by their reliance on climate factors, without reference 
  to modulating influences of environmental, ecological, demographic, or socioeconomic 
  factors. Although the most recent of several biologically based model studies 
  suggests that the increase in population living in regions of potential malaria 
  transmission would be on the order of an extra 260-320 million people in 
  2080 (against a baseline expectation of about 8 billion), a recent statistically 
  based modeling study, which incorporated conservative assumptions, estimated 
  that there would be no net change in actual transmission of malaria by 2080, 
  assuming a business-as-usual climate scenario and adaptation. In the latter 
  study, regional increases and decreases would approximately cancel out.</p>
<p>Changes in climate, including changes in climate variability, would affect 
  many other vector-borne infections (such as various types of mosquito-borne 
  encephalitis, Lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis) at the margins of current 
  distributions (medium to high confidence). For some diseases&#151;such as malaria 
  in the Sahel, Western equine encephalitis in North America, and tick-borne encephalitis 
  in Europe&#151;a net decrease may occur. Changes in surface water quantity and 
  quality will affect the incidence of diarrheal diseases (medium confidence). 
  Ocean warming will facilitate transmission of cholera in coastal areas (low 
  confidence; speculative).<br>
</p>
<p>Fish and shellfish poisoning is closely associated with marine ecology. There 
  is some evidence that sea-surface warming associated with El Ni&ntilde;o increases 
  the risk to humans of ciguatera poisoning and the occurrence of toxic (and ecologically 
  harmful) algal blooms. Climate change will increase the incidence of ciguatera 
  poisoning and shellfish poisoning (low confidence).<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change represents an additional pressure on the world's food supply 
  system and is expected to increase yields at higher latitudes and lead to decreases 
  at lower latitudes. These regional differences in climate impacts on agricultural 
  yield are likely to grow stronger over time, with net beneficial effects on 
  yields and production in the developed world and net negative effects in the 
  developing world. This would increase the number of undernourished people in 
  the developing world (medium confidence).<br>
</p>
<p>In some settings, the impacts of climate change may cause social disruption, 
  economic decline, and displacement of populations. The ability of affected communities 
  to adapt to such disruptive events will depend on the social, political, and 
  economic situation of the country and its population. The health impacts associated 
  with such social-economic dislocation and population displacement are substantial 
  [high confidence; well-established]. <br>
</p>
<p>For each anticipated adverse health impact there is a range of social, institutional, 
  technological, and behavioral adaptation options to lessen that impact. There 
  is a basic and general need for public health infrastructure (programs, services, 
  surveillance systems) to be strengthened and maintained. It also is crucial 
  for nonhealth policy sectors to appreciate how the social and physical conditions 
  of living affect population health.<br>
</p>
<p>Our scientific capacity to model the various potential health outcomes of climate 
  change is limited. Nevertheless, it is clear that for many health outcomes&#151;especially 
  for those that result indirectly from a sequence of environmental and social 
  impacts&#151;precise and localized projections cannot yet be made. In the meantime, 
  a precautionary approach requires that policy development proceed on the basis 
  of available&#151;though often limited and qualitative&#151;evidence of how 
  climate change will affect patterns of human population health. Furthermore, 
  high priority should be assigned to improving the public health infrastructure 
  and developing and implementing effective adaptation measures.</p>
