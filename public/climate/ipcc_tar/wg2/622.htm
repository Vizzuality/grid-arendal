<h3><a name="1713"></a>17.1.3. Past and Present Trends </h3>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Second Assessment 
  Report (SAR) projected a global average temperature increase of 1.0-3.5&deg;C, 
  and a consequential rise in global mean sea level of 15-95 cm by the year 
  2100. Results from observational data show that temperatures have been increasing 
  by as much as 0.1&deg;C per decade and sea levels by approximately 2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  in the regions where most of the small island states are located&#151;namely, 
  the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea (see <a href="#fig171">Figure 
  17-1</a>). There also is evidence that the ENSO phenomenon will continue 
  to have a major influence on climate variability in these regions.</p>

<p><a name="fig171"></a>Analyses conducted by the New Zealand Meteorological Services 
  reveal that, since 1920, temperature has risen by 0.6-0.7&deg;C in Noumea 
  (New Caledonia) and Rarotonga (Cook Islands), which is greater than the mean 
  global increase. Based on data from 34 stations in the Pacific from about 160&deg;E 
  and mostly south of the equator, surface air temperatures have increased by 
  0.3-0.8&deg;C during the 20th century, with the greatest increase in the 
  zone southwest of the SPCZ. This is well in excess of global rates of warming. 
  Further recent work undertaken by the New Zealand Institute of Water and Atmospheric 
  Research (NIWA) shows a noticeable change in aspects of the South Pacific climate 
  since the mid-1970s. For instance, western Kiribati, the northern Cook Islands, 
  Tokelau, and northern French Polynesia have become wetter, whereas New Caledonia, 
  Fiji, and Tonga have become drier. Meanwhile, Samoa, eastern Kiribati, Tokelau, 
  and northeast French Polynesia have become cloudier, with warmer nighttime temperatures; 
  New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, the southern Cook islands, and southwest French 
  Polynesia and Tuvalu have become warmer and sunnier (Salinger <i>et al.,</i> 
  1995). It also might be noted that in the Pacific generally, observed changes 
  in temperature and cloudiness appear to be closely influenced by the pattern 
  of ENSO events (Salinger, 1999).</p>
<p>The records also indicate that rainfall has increased in the northeast Pacific 
  but has decreased in the southwest Pacific region. Interannual variations in 
  temperature and rainfall are strongly associated with ENSO, resulting in water 
  shortages and drought in Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, the Federated 
  States of Micronesia, American Samoa, Samoa, and Fiji. Although a causal link 
  has yet to be established, all of the foregoing changes have coincided with 
  an eastward shift of the SPCZ since 1970. Research now suggests that some of 
  the foregoing changes (including the shift in the SPCZ) may be closely correlated 
  with interdecadal patterns of variability&#151;for example, the Pacific Decadal 
  Oscillation (PDO) (Salinger and Mullen, 1999). It should be noted, nevertheless, 
  that the changes observed in the 20th century are considered to be consistent 
  with patterns related to anthropogenic GHG-induced climate change (Salinger<i> 
  et al.,</i> 1995; Hay, 2000).</p>
<p>The most significant and more immediate consequences for small island states 
  are likely to be related to changes in sea levels, rainfall regimes, soil moisture 
  budgets, and prevailing winds (speed and direction), as well as short-term variations 
  in regional and local sea levels and patterns of wave action (Sem <i>et al.,</i> 
  1996). The short-term (including interannual) variations are likely to be strengthened 
  by the ENSO phenomenon. Vulnerability assessment studies undertaken in some 
  small islands suggest that climate change will impose diverse and significant 
  impacts on small island states (Leatherman, 1997). In most small islands (including 
  the high islands), the majority of the population, socioeconomic activities, 
  and infrastructure are located within a few hundred meters of the coast; therefore, 
  they are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise 
  (Hay <i>et al.,</i> 1995; Bijlsma, 1996; Nurse <i>et al., </i>1998; Burns, 2000). 
  In this regard, an increase in the frequency and magnitude of tropical cyclones 
  would be a major concern for small island states. This would increase the risk 
  of flooding, accelerate existing rates of beach erosion, and cause displacement 
  of settlements and infrastructure. </p>
<p>The key questions, therefore, are how will the impacts manifest themselves, 
  and what are the most appropriate responses for avoiding, minimizing, or adapting 
  to these impacts? Because small island states traditionally experience some 
  of the greatest interannual variations in climatic and oceanic conditions, many 
  of their natural systems are well adapted to the stresses that result. Thus, 
  many strategies that small island states might employ to adapt to climate change 
  usually are the same as those that constitute sound environmental management, 
  wise use of resources, and appropriate responses to present-day climate variability.</p>
<p>Although the full extent of climate change impacts in the small island states 
  is far from certain, mostly adverse consequences are projected for several systems. 
  The combined effect of GHG-induced climate change and sea-level rise can contribute 
  to coastal erosion and land loss, flooding, soil salinization, and intrusion 
  of saltwater into groundwater aquifers. The quantity and quality of available 
  water supplies can affect agricultural production and human health. Similarly, 
  changes in SST, ocean circulation, and upwelling could affect marine organisms 
  such as corals, seagrasses, and fish stocks. Tourism&#151;which is a very important 
  economic activity in many island states&#151;could be affected through beach 
  erosion, loss of land, and degraded reef ecosystems, as well as changes in seasonal 
  patterns of rainfall.</p>
