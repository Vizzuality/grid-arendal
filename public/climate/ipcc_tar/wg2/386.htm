<h4>10.2.1.4. Impacts and Vulnerability </h4>
<p>Sensitivity analyses of major rivers of the continent indicate that these rivers 
  are sensitive to climate change. Magadza (1996) examined changes in water storage 
  in Zimbabwe's main water storage facilities during the 1991-1992 drought 
  cycle. During this period, the mean temperature averaged 2&deg;C above the long-term 
  seasonal mean, and seasonal Penman evaporation exceeded the long-term seasonal 
  mean by more than 30%&#151;peaking at just less than 90% in February at the 
  Kutsaga station. During this drought cycle, stored water resources dwindled 
  to less than 10% of installed capacity.</p>
<p>Urbiztondo (1992) simulated the response of Lake Kariba power-generating capacity 
  to various climate change scenarios. His results indicate that with no significant 
  change in precipitation, the lake would regulary fail to meet installed generating 
  capacity if the temperature rose by 4&deg;C. During dry years, generating capacity 
  would decrease by as much as 50%. Even during wet years, maximum generating 
  capacity would barely exceed 50% of installed capacity.</p>
<p>Economic impacts from curtailment of hydropower generation from Lale Kariba, 
  as a result of the 1991-1992 drought, were estimated to be US$102 million 
  loss in GDP, US$36 million loss in export earnings, and loss of 3,000 jobs (Benson 
  and Clay, 1998). The direct impacts on agriculture and the knockon impacts also 
  were quite severe. These limited estimates provide a window on potential economic 
  impacts of climate change-mediated water resources changes in the medium term 
  (i.e., into the middle of the 21st century&#151;a time span within the planning 
  window of economic development strategies).</p>
<p>With an estimated error of about 8%, the Gambia River flow has been shown to 
  be very sensive to climate change. Based on the results of river flow responses 
  and vulnerability analysis, climate variables alone can cause a 50% change in 
  runoff in the Gambia River catchment (Jallow <i>et al., </i>1999). In general, 
  a 1% change in rainfall will result in a 3% change in runoff (Manneh, 1997). 
  On the whole, this translates into saltwater intrusion into the Gambia River 
  by 40 km at times of maximum intrusion. However, the flushing action of freshwater 
  flow of the river will keep the saline/freshwater interface at an equilibrium, 
  oscillating between 90 and 290 km. The rate of saline water intrusion during 
  dry seasons would increase from about 20 km per month in January to about 40 
  km per month in April and May. </p>
<h4><a name="10215"></a>10.2.1.5. Adaptation</h4>
<p>Likely changes in precipitation and discharge regimes call for a wide range 
  of adaptations. Broadly, these adaptations would include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refinement of early warning sytems to enable timely remedial measures <br>
  </li>
  <li>Shared basin management, necessitating international agreements<br>
  </li>
  <li>Water-use strategies&#151;especially demand management&#151;in industry, 
    settlements, and agriculture<br>
  </li>
  <li>Intensified monitoring to improve data reliability<br>
  </li>
  <li>Intensive research into energy usage and alternate renewable energy at household 
    and industrial levels<br>
  </li>
  <li>Intensive research into design of infrastructure facilities, such as roads 
    and telecommunications, to withstand extreme events<br>
  </li>
  <li>Intensive research into flood control management technology<br>
  </li>
  <li>Innovation in building designs (e.g., to minimize urban flooding)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Research into and commencement of coastal defense facilities<br>
  </li>
  <li>Research into adaptive agricultural startegies<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reserarch into environmental flow requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are now subregional climate change scenarios for the African 
  region, the quality of such scenarios varies with the intensity of historical 
  data and the spatial distribution of monitoring stations. There is an urgent 
  need to intensify the density of monitoring stations to improve climate change 
  scenarios. The cost of rehabilitating stations that are in disrepair is not 
  beyond the financial capability of African states. Appreciation of the strategic 
  importance of these facilities and a sense of ownership of climate change concerns 
  needs to be reawakened.</p>
<p>It has been noted that practically all of the major river basins of Africa 
  include several states. In recognition of this fact, the past decade has seen 
  the development of international river basin mangement protocols&#151;such as 
  the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Shared Waters, 
  the Niger Basin Authority, and several others, including the more recent Lake 
  Victoria Fisheries Authority. The United Nations Environment Programme International 
  Environmental Technology Center (UNEP-ITEC) have emphasized the river basin 
  as the fundamental unit of management (UNEP, 2000). We recommend that these 
  international basin authorities be strengthened in terms of finance and human 
  resources and that their perspectives should embrace near- and long-term climate 
  variability and climate change issues in their work plans. Most important is 
  that the legal framework for such river basin authorities should be robust to 
  ensure equity in access to and accountability for water supply and water quality 
  management. Failure to take these concepts on board could lead to water resources-related 
  conflict.</p>
<p>In general, the African continent lacks technical strategies to optimize water 
  resources. A few countries (e.g., South Africa and Zimbabwe) have begun to develop 
  strategies for optimum use of water resources&#151;using, for example, water 
  pricing and demand management tools. Crop-watering technology is primitive and 
  wasteful in most cases. Few industrial and household water-usage strategies 
  incorporate water reuse. During drought periods, management authorities have 
  resorted to supply restrictions, such as the 3-day supply per week in Mutare 
  during the 1991-1992 drought. Water supply shortages conventionally are 
  addressed through construction of more impoundments. Magadza (1996) remarks 
  that in severe drought periods there would be a multiple failure syndrome of 
  water storage facilities, especially where individual reservoirs are dedicated 
  to defined communities. Although supply structures (banning of garden hoses) 
  and construction of storage reservoirs are practical options, demand management&#151;which 
  reduces consumption per unit of product output&#151;has proved increasingly 
  to be a water-saving strategy that can allow communities to enter a drought 
  cycle with adequate supplies.</p>
<p>Whatever strategies are adopted for optimizing water usage, successful development 
  of such strategies is contingent on reliable meteorological and hydrological 
  information. In many instances, application of hydrological models on a basin-wide 
  scale is restricted by data density. Reliable impacts assessments and near-term 
  predictions depend on robust databases. For example, flood propagation and thus 
  flood warning capability, which are real-time processes, are a function of the 
  density of measuring points. Similarly, crop yield forecasts could be made spatially 
  more accurate by improving the intensity of climatic measurements.</p>
<p>Over the past half-century, Africa has invested heavily in hydroelectric power 
  schemes. Recent drought episodes and demand escalation have highlighted the 
  vulnerability of even the largest hydroelectric plants to climate variability 
  (Magadza, 1996). This assessment has shown that future water resources, especially 
  in the subhumid to semi-arid regions of the African savanna and subtropics, 
  will be more restricted. Research into other forms of renewable energy and energy-use 
  efficiency in industry and households is an essential inverstment in a more 
  energy-secure future. At the regional level, energy resource sharing is a necessary 
  strategy. Individual states must have trust and confidence to invest in neighboring 
  countries for overall regional energy security. </p>
<p>Populations that live in flood-prone areas need to consider strategies for 
  early warning procedures for flood events; strategic planning in the location 
  of human habitations to minimize flood impacts; and strategies for robust protocols 
  for alleviating impacts of drought events to minimize loss of human life, economic 
  assets, and societal norms. On the other hand, early warning systems can be 
  effective if impacted areas are accessible in the worst-case scenario, to enable 
  either evacuation or relief supplies delivery.</p>
<p>Although there are major reservoirs on most large African river basins, these 
  reservoirs were not designed for flood control. However, synchronization of 
  operations of reservoirs that are located in the same basin can alleviate flood 
  impacts. Nevertheless, there is a need to consider purposely building flood 
  control facilities in some of the flood-prone areas of Africa, similar to those 
  found on the Danube, which reduce flood crest intensity by sequestering floodwaters 
  into temporary storage facilities along the river. This could be a subject of 
  directed research for each African basin.</p>
<p>Research into coastal defense systems is an immediate need. Several African 
  coastal areas already are experiencing sigificant coastal impacts. Coastal management 
  infrastructures are likely to entail intergenerational investment programs in 
  which each extent generation must make its contribution to minimize long-term 
  costs. If our generation abrogates our responsibilities to future generations, 
  we will impose immense costs on our posterity.</p>
<p>To minimize sensitivity to climate change, African economies should be more 
  diversified, and agricultural technology should optimize water usage through 
  efficient irrigation and crop development. Considerable advances have been made 
  in agricultural industries of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa 
  and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>As water resource stresses become acute in future water-deficit areas of Africa 
  as a result of a combination of climate impacts and escalating human demand, 
  there will be intensifying conflict between human and environmental demands 
  on water resources. Because maintanance of healthy ecosystems is an underpinning 
  to economic sustainability, there is need in each water basin management unit 
  to identify and factor into development projects the need for environmental 
  flows.</p>
