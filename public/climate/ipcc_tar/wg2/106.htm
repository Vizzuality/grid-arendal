<h3>2.6.2. "Objective" and "Subjective" Probabilities are 
  not Always Explicitly Distinguished </h3>
<p>Some scientists have expressed concern that scientific investigation requires 
  a long sequence of observational records, replicable trials, or model runs (e.g., 
  Monte Carlo simulations) so the results can be specified by a formal statistical 
  characterization of the frequency and frequency distribution of outcomes being 
  assessed. In statistical terms, "objective" science means attempting 
  to verify any hypothesis through a series of experiments and recording the frequency 
  with which that particular outcome occurs. The idea of a limitless set of identical 
  and independent trials that is "objectively out there" is a heuristic 
  device that we use to help us rigorously quantify uncertainty by using frequentist 
  statistics. Although there may be a large number of trials in some cases, however, 
  this is not the same as a "limitless" number, and these trials rarely 
  are truly identical or independent.</p>
<p>Most interesting complex systems cannot possibly be put to every conceivable 
  test to find the frequency of occurrence of some socially or environmentally 
  salient event. The popular philosophical view of "objective science" 
  as a series of "falsifications" breaks down when it confronts systems 
  that cannot be fully tested. For example, because climate change forecasts are 
  not empirically determinable (except by "performing the experiment" 
  on the real Earth&#151;Schneider, 1997), scientists must rely on "surrogate" 
  experiments, such as computer simulations of the Earth undergoing volcanic eruptions 
  or paleoclimatic changes. As a result of these surrogate experiments and many 
  additional tests of the reliability of subcomponents of such models, scientists 
  attain confidence to varying degrees about the likelihood of various outcomes 
  (e.g., they might assign with high confidence a low probability to the occurrence 
  of extreme climate outcomes such as a "runaway greenhouse effect"). 
  These confidence levels are not frequentist statistics but "subjective 
  probabilities" that represent degrees of belief that are based on a combination 
  of objective and subjective subcomponents of the total system. Because subjective 
  characterization of the likelihood of many potentially important climatic events&#151;especially 
  those that might be characterized by some people as "dangerous"&#151;is 
  unavoidable, "Bayesian" or "subjective" characterization 
  of probability will be more appropriate. </p>
<p>Bayesian assessments of probability distributions would lead to the following 
  interpretation of probability statements: The probability of an event is the 
  degree of belief that exists among lead authors and reviewers that the event 
  will occur, given the observations, modeling results, and theory currently available, 
  all of which contribute to estimation of a "prior" probability for 
  the occurrence of an outcome. As new data or theories become available, revised 
  estimates of the subjective probability of the occurrence of that event&#151;so-called 
  "posterior probability"&#151;can be made, perhaps via the formalism 
  of Bayes theorem (see, e.g., Edwards, 1992, for a philosophical basis for Bayesian 
  methods; for applications of Bayesian methods, see, e.g., Howard <i>et al</i>., 
  1972; Anderson, 1998; Tol and de Vos, 1998; Malakoff, 1999)</p>
