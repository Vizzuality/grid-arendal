<h3><a name="1634"></a>16.3.4. Uncertainties and Risks</h3>
<p>The polar regions will play a substantial role in driving global climate change 
  through positive feedbacks to global warming. They also provide us with unparalleled 
  records of that change. The most important uncertainties, risks, and thus targets 
  for research are as follows:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Ocean thermohaline circulation</i>: Will downwelling in the North Atlantic 
    and the Southern Ocean cease, causing a shutdown of the circulation of the 
    global ocean? Or will this downwelling simply reduce and eventually recover 
    with stabilization of GHGs? What is the role of changing input of freshwater 
    from Arctic rivers? </li>
  <li><i>Antarctic ice sheet</i>: What will be the contribution of the Antarctic 
    ice sheets to global sea-level rise over the coming centuries? Although it 
    is likely that the Antarctic ice sheet will provide some degree of mitigation 
    of predicted sea-level rise, there is a small risk that the West Antarctic 
    ice sheet (or portions of it) may retreat rapidly, causing a greater than 
    predicted rise.</li>
  <li><i>Marine biology</i>: What will be the response to predicted climate change 
    of the structure of marine communities and the overall productivity of polar 
    oceans? Uncertainty arises because existing biological models are not yet 
    sufficiently developed to provide authoritative and quantitative estimates. 
    There is some risk of unforeseen collapse of parts of the marine biological 
    system, with consequent global effects&#151;particularly on fisheries.</li>
  <li><i>Arctic ice sheets, glaciers, and ice caps</i>: What is the current and 
    future magnitude of freshwater input to the oceans from ice masses? What is 
    the impact on global sea level and the thermohaline circulation on decadal 
    to century time scales, and how can uncertainties in estimates be reduced?</li>
  <li><i>Permafrost</i>: As ice-rich permafrost degrades, what will be the magnitude, 
    spatial extent, and variability of its impacts? Will increases in the thickness 
    of the active layer in currently cold, continuous permafrost be sufficient 
    to cause widespread damage to human infrastructure? How important is soil 
    organic carbon sequestered in the upper layer of permafrost in the context 
    of the world carbon balance?</li>
  <li><i>Arctic hydrology</i>: Will the balance between increased precipitation 
    and evapotranspiration lead to a drier or wetter Arctic landscape? What will 
    be the water balances of the large river basins that generate freshwater inflow 
    to the Arctic Ocean?</li>
  <li><i>Arctic sea ice</i>: Is it possible that with increased open water in 
    the Arctic Ocean, summer sea ice in the Arctic eventually could disappear 
    completely? The risk is that substantially more open water could generate 
    large changes in regional climate for countries on the Arctic rim.</li>
  <li><i>Fluxes of greenhouse gases</i>: What are the current and future fluxes 
    of GHGs from polar oceans and landscapes? In particular, what is the likely 
    future role of gas hydrates? </li>
  <li><i>Stresses on human communities in the Arctic</i>: Can Arctic communities 
    survive the combined stresses of globalization and marked changes in their 
    local environments that may result from climate change? Traditional lifestyles 
    will be threatened, but the communities that practice these lifestyles may 
    be sufficiently resilient to cope with these changes, as they have in the 
    recent and distant past.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
