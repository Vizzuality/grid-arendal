<h2>9.2. Research into the Relationship between Climate Change and Health: Caveats 
  and Challenges</h2>
<h3><a name="921"></a>9.2.1. New Knowledge about Climate Change Impacts on Health</h3>
<p>Since the SAR, much of the additional research on health impacts has examined 
  natural climate variability in relation to interannual variations in infectious 
  diseases&#151;particularly vector-borne diseases&#151;and the relationship between 
  daily weather and mortality in various urban populations. Predictive modeling 
  of the impact of climate scenarios on vector-borne disease transmissibility 
  has undergone further development. Meanwhile, however, data sets that allow 
  study of the effects of the health impacts of observed longer term trends in 
  climate remain sparse. </p>
<h3><a name="922"></a>9.2.2. Characteristics and Methodological Difficulties </h3>
<p>The research task of assessing the actual and potential health impacts of climate 
  change has several distinctive characteristics and poses four major challenges 
  to scientists:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Anticipated anthropogenic climate change will be a gradual and long-term 
    process. This projected change in mean climate conditions is likely to be 
    accompanied by regional changes in the frequency of extreme events. Changes 
    in particular health outcomes already may be occurring or soon may begin to 
    occur, in response to recent and ongoing changes in world climate. Identification 
    of such health effects will require carefully planned epidemiological studies.</li>
  <li>In epidemiological studies (in which associations are observed with or without 
    knowledge of likely causal mechanisms), there often are difficulties in estimating 
    the role of climate per se as a cause of change in health status. Changes 
    in climate typically are accompanied by various other environmental changes. 
    Because most diseases have multiple contributory causes, it often is difficult 
    to attribute causation between climatic factors and other coexistent factors. 
    For example, in a particular place, clearing of forest for agriculture and 
    extension of irrigation may coincide with a rise in regional temperature. 
    Because all three factors could affect mosquito abundance, it is difficult 
    to apportion between them the causation of any observed subsequent increase 
    in mosquito-borne infection. This difficulty is well recognized by epidemiologists 
    as the "confounding" of effects.</li>
  <li>It is equally important to recognize that certain factors can modify the 
    vulnerability of a particular population to the health impacts of climate 
    change or variability. This type of effect-modification (or "interaction") 
    can be induced by endogenous characteristics of the population (such as nutritional 
    or immune status) or contextual circumstances that influence the "sensitivity" 
    of the population's response to the climate change (such as unplanned 
    urbanization, crowding, or access to air conditioning during heat waves). 
    Deliberate social, technological, or behavioral adaptations to reduce the 
    health impacts of climate change are an important category of effect-modifying 
    factor.</li>
  <li>Simulation of scenario-based health risks with predictive models entails 
    three challenges. These challenges relate to validity, uncertainty, and contextual 
    realism: 
    <ul>
      <li>Valid representation of the main environmental and biological relationships 
        and the interacting ecological and social processes that influence the 
        impact of those relationships on health is difficult. A balance must be 
        attained between complexity and simplicity.</li>
      <li>There are various sources of (largely unavoidable) uncertainty. There 
        is uncertainty attached to the input scenarios of climate change (and 
        of associated social, demographic, and economic trends). Subsequently, 
        there are three main types of uncertainties in the modeling process itself: 
        "normal" statistical variation (reflecting stochastic processes 
        of the real world); uncertainty about the correct or appropriate values 
        of key parameters in the model; and incomplete knowledge about the structural 
        relationships represented in the model.</li>
      <li>Climate change is not the sole global environmental change that affects 
        human health. Various large-scale environmental changes now impinge on 
        human population health simultaneously, and often interactively (Watson 
        et al., 1998). An obvious example is vector-borne infectious diseases, 
        which are affected by climatic conditions, population movement, forest 
        clearance and land-use patterns, freshwater surface configurations, human 
        population density, and the population density of insectivorous predators 
        (Gubler, 1998b). In accordance with point 2 above, each change in health 
        outcome must be appropriately apportioned between climate and other influences.
