<h4>14.2.1.4. Temperate Forests and Mountain and Polar Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Studies carried out in Latin America on the potential impact of climate change 
  in mountain ecosystems report an increase in mean temperature followed by a 
  gradual reduction of glaciers in the high mountains (Fl&oacute;rez, 1992). As 
  Fl&oacute;rez (1992) has reported, in Colombia there will be an ascent of the 
  altitudinal limits of forest and agriculture, reducing the paramo life zone 
  and possibly causing disappearance of current flora and fauna. The limits of 
  the Andean and sub-Andean life zones also would ascend, as would the upper limit 
  of the lowland tropical forest zone (Pab&oacute;n, 1995b; van der Hammen, 1997). 
  In the same way, studies in Costa Rica suggest the same effect on the tropical 
  montane cloud forests, where biodiversity is very high. Halpin and Smith (1991) 
  identify three types of changes in the areal arrangement of ecoclimatic zones 
  in Costa Rica from four GCM models (UKMO, GISS, OSU, and GFDL). The first change 
  is a strong trend toward displacement of montane and subalpine zones by warmer 
  pre-montane climate types. The second change indicates potential heat stress 
  in vegetation, and the third is a change in all altitudinal levels toward warmer 
  climate types.</p>
<p>Villers-Ruiz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez (1997) determined the vulnerability of 
  Mexican forest ecosystems and forestry areas to climate change under two climate 
  change scenarios, considering doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (CCCM and GFDL-R30 
  models). They used Holdridge's life zones classification for their analysis. 
  Their results showed that the most affected life zones would be temperate cold 
  and warm forests. They conclude that increases in temperature and decreases 
  in precipitation would reduce the extent of cool temperate and warm temperate 
  life zones but would increase dry and very dry tropical forest zones.</p>
<p>The most affected natural protected areas in Mexico would be those located 
  in the northern and western regions of the country (Villers-Ruiz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez, 
  1998). Similarly, the most affected forest exploitation areas would be those 
  located in the western part of Mexico. These changes suggest that life zones 
  that sustain temperate desert, warm temperate desert, and cool temperate wet 
  forest would disappear or would be severely reduced (Villers-Ruiz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez, 
  1998). These changes would put national cellulose and paper production at risk 
  because high and medium forestry production areas are located in the northern 
  and western states of Mexico (Vargas-P&eacute;rez and Terrazas-Dom&iacute;nguez, 
  1991). Cool, temperate moist and wet forests (coniferous and oak forests) currently 
  occupy these zones. </p>
<p>Natural protected areas would be affected by the change of their original vegetation, 
  causing a reduction of animal populations. Sierra de Manantl&aacute;n and the 
  Monarch Butterfly reserves are examples of climate change impacts on natural 
  protected areas (Villers-Ruiz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez, 1998).</p>
<p>The severe drought during early 1998, associated with an El Ni&ntilde;o event, 
  resulted in an unusually large number of forest fires and severe economic losses 
  (Palacio <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Cairns <i>et al.</i> (2000) estimates fuel consumption 
  and coal emission in tropical Mexico for those events. The land-use/land-cover 
  classes most extensively impacted were evergreen tropical forests and fragmented 
  forests. They point out that similar fire events may be expected more frequently 
  in the future if global change shifts toward a warmer and drier climate. The 
  atmospheric consequences of those events were continuous emission of smoke to 
  the United States for a large period of time (Wright, 1999). The costs from 
  droughts and forest fires in Mexico and Central America during El Ni&ntilde;o 
  were approximately US$600 million. </p>
<p>The effects of a strong El Ni&ntilde;o event on terrestrial ecosystems of Peru 
  and Ecuador are as relevant (with high possibility) as in the ocean and shores 
  (Arntz and Fahrbach, 1996). Increases in precipitation were recorded in Ecuador, 
  Colombia, and northern Peru during the 1982-1983 El Ni&ntilde;o event, 
  with a simultaneous decrease in rainfall southward. Increases in precipitation 
  also were recorded during the 1941 El Ni&ntilde;o event. However, the increase 
  in rainfall should not be assumed to be homogeneous. Whereas significant increases 
  have been recorded in northern Peru, Ecuador, and even Colombia, severe droughts 
  occurred around the Titicaca region and in northern Chile. In the highlands 
  of the Andes as well, a north-south gradient in rainfall has been observed during 
  El Ni&ntilde;o events.</p>
<p>Increases in precipitation during El Ni&ntilde;o events result in enhanced 
  vegetation cover (from 5 to 89%) and primary productivity (from 0.005 to 3.5 
  t yr<sup>-1</sup>) in coastal desert ecosystems. In northern Peru, strong El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events increase not only the ephemeral vegetation but also seed germination 
  and seedling recruitment of woody species. Increases in precipitation from 20 
  mm (1996) to more than 1,000 mm (December 1997 to May 1998) have been recorded 
  in Belizario in northern Peru. This increase in rainfall was correlated with 
  a significant increase in annual NPP of the herb layer in a dry Prosopis pallida 
  woodland, from almost zero in December 1997 to 0.51 g<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in February 1998. 
  In the same region, the annual NPP of the shrub and tree layers also were significantly 
  higher during the El Ni&ntilde;o event, but fruit productivity decreased as 
  a result of the mechanic effect of rain drops on buds, flowers, and immature 
  fruits. Demographic explosions of two land snails were observed (Torres Guevara, 
  1992) during the increase in vegetation cover and annual NPP in northern Peru 
  during 1998.</p>
<p>Besides the foregoing observations, little information has been reported about 
  the explosive development of plant cover during strong El Ni&ntilde;o events. 
  Moreover, no data are available about the way in which this enhanced annual 
  NPP impacts wildlife and range activities. According to Arntz and Fahrbach (1996), 
  however, during this vegetation "explosion," insects, snails, and 
  other invertebrates increase in number and diversity. Consequently, vertebrates 
  such as rodents, birds, and foxes benefit from a diversified and enriched diet. 
  Observational studies confirm a significant increase in the density of rodents 
  (Muridae and Cricetidae), followed by an increase in the activity of foxes (<i>Dusicyon 
  culpaeus</i>). The considerable increase in the density of insects and rodent 
  populations has a direct impact on agriculture. Damage associated with the incidence 
  of pests on crops is further aggravated by the occurrence of floods.</p>
<p>Extraordinarily strong precipitation during El Ni&ntilde;o events is not restricted 
  to the continent. The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands also were affected by increased 
  rainfall during 1983. As in continental ecosystems, enhanced annual NPP had 
  direct consequences on the densities of species in higher trophic levels (Tarazona 
  and Valle, 1999).</p>
<p>As a consequence of the unusual combination of climatic and meteorological 
  conditions attributed to the El Ni&ntilde;o before and after the winter of 1997-1998, 
  fires had a particularly strong effect on forests in Mexico. The number of fires 
  was twice the average for the period 1992-1997 and 35% higher than the 
  historical high mark recorded in 1988. The area affected was three times larger 
  than the average for the same period (Barkin and Garc&iacute;a, 1999). Economic 
  losses from those fires were estimated to be about US$230 million (Delgadillo 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Following the increase in rainfall associated with the 
  strong El Ni&ntilde;o event in 1982-1983, the next 2 years were exceptionally 
  dry and cold in the Gal&aacute;pagos. Most of the plant biomass produced during 
  the rainy years died back and accumulated as a result of the low decomposition 
  rate. This increase in dry biomass is directly associated with the occurrence 
  of fires affecting large areas. Recovery of plant cover after fires has been 
  different in grasslands and woody vegetation. Whereas species diversity in grasslands 
  has increased, fires had dramatic effects on woody vegetation because many trees 
  and shrubs were severely affected by underground fires (Arntz and Fahrbach, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Scenarios of climate change for Latin America mountain areas are highly uncertain 
  because available GCMs do not provide sufficiently accurate local predictions. 
  Glacial retreat is underway in various parts of the Andes and in the ice fields 
  at the southern tip of the continent (Canziani <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Shifting 
  of ecosystems upslope is expected to result in loss of some vegetation types 
  and increased vulnerability to genetic and environmental pressures.</p>
