<h4><a name="15323"></a>15.3.2.3. Rocky Mountains-Southwest U.S. Subregion </h4>
<p>Rapid population growth coupled with water supplies that are limited, heavily 
  utilized, and highly variable present significant challenges to governments 
  and the private sector in this region. The effects of climate change may add 
  further stresses (Frederick and Schwarz, 1999). One strategy that has been developed 
  to cope with these issues is use of water banks. Water banks can be used to 
  mitigate the economic impacts of drought periods by increasing the reliability 
  of water supply or by facilitating short-term reallocation of water among users. 
  Water banks can be used for environmental purposes&#151;for example, Idaho's 
  water banks have provided significant quantities of water to assist anadromous 
  fish passage (Miller, 2000b). However, to the extent that water banking entails 
  increased water withdrawals from surface sources, there could be further adverse 
  impacts on aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>There are two types of arrangements to which the term "water bank" 
  has been applied. "Groundwater storage banks" include active conjunctive-use 
  programs whereby surface water is used to recharge an aquifer, which is then 
  used as a source of water supply during periods when surface water is less abundant. 
  Another use of the term "water bank" refers to a formal mechanism 
  created to facilitate voluntary changes in the use of water under existing rights. 
  We can distinguish these as "water transfer banks." The defining feature 
  of this type of water bank is that it provides an established process or procedure 
  for accomplishing such transfers. California has pioneered the development of 
  both types of water banks. Various groundwater recharge programs have been developed 
  in California, some of which incorporate features of groundwater banks and water 
  transfer banks. One such example, the Bakersfield Recharge Facility in Kern 
  County, is discussed below. The Emergency Drought Water Banks set up by the 
  state of California in 1991, 1992, and 1994 are examples of water transfer banks.<br>
</p>
<p>In 1987, at the beginning of a severe multi-year drought, California had relatively 
  little experience with privately arranged water transfers outside the confines 
  of individual irrigation districts and major project service areas. The lack 
  of market development may have been related, in part, to the predominance of 
  large state and federal water projects in California and, in part, to the difficulty 
  of obtaining approval for such transfers from the California State Water Resources 
  Control Board (SWRCB) (MacDonnell, 1990; NRC, 1992). As the drought persisted, 
  it became clear that neither within-project water transfers nor those requiring 
  approval of the SWRCB were likely to occur in sufficient volume to alleviate 
  the very uneven impacts of the drought on major urban centers and irrigated 
  agriculture. In 1991, the state responded to the growing crisis by creating 
  the first Emergency Drought Water Bank. California's Department of Water 
  Resources (DWR) acted as the manager of these water banks because most of the 
  anticipated transfers required conveyance of the water through State Water Project 
  (SWP) facilities (primarily the state's pumping plant in the Sacramento/ 
  San Joaquin delta and the California aqueduct). DWR personnel negotiated the 
  purchase contracts, monitored compliance with those contracts, obtained SWRCB 
  approval where needed, and coordinated deliveries of water to purchasers. Despite 
  initial difficulties in estimating the quantity of water needed and the appropriate 
  price, as well as some concerns about uncompensated third-party impacts, the 
  program generally is considered to have been a major success&#151;with net economic 
  benefits far exceeding any negative impacts (Howitt <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1992; Dixon <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1993; MacDonnell <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1994).<br>
</p>
<p>Another successful California water bank is the 1,135-ha recharge facility 
  operated by the city of Bakersfield. This groundwater-banking program also facilitates 
  water transfers. The city owns Kern River water rights, which yield a highly 
  variable quantity of water from 1 year to the next. A portion of these rights 
  is leased on long-term contracts to neighboring irrigation districts. The city 
  has constructed a recharge facility into which it spreads much of its remaining 
  Kern River water. This activity has increased the amount of water that potentially 
  is available for extraction in the underlying aquifer. Three other water districts 
  also are allowed to bank their surplus water by spreading it in the recharge 
  facility. Each bank participant can withdraw the water in its own account, as 
  needed (e.g., during drought periods), or transfer the water to another party: 
  <br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>"The banked water can be extracted and transported for direct use, sold 
    or exchanged, with the stipulation that extracted water must be used in the 
    San Joaquin Valley portion of Kern County for irrigation, light commercial 
    and industrial, and municipal or domestic purposes, unless otherwise specified. 
    Located upstream of the facility, the city of Bakersfield often sells its 
    banked water to users downstream, or exchanges it for water from other sources" 
    (Wong, 1999).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operation of this recharge facility provides county water users with drought 
  insurance and flood control benefits. "Banking recharge operations during 
  flood release periods serve to minimize downstream flooding problems while maximizing 
  recharge of water on the Kern River for local benefit" (Wong, 1999). For 
  example, the bank participants successfully used the recharge facility in 1995 
  to manage heavy runoff.</p>
<h4><a name="15324"></a>15.3.2.4. Prairies-Great Plains Subregion </h4>
<p>An attempt at proactive "mitigation" of an atmospheric threat is 
  the cloud seeding program underway in Alberta since 1996 to reduce the severity 
  of hailstorms. Central North America is one of the most hail-prone regions in 
  the world. A 1995 hailstorm did more than US$1.1 billion damage in Dallas, a 
  1990 storm did US$600 million damage in Denver, and a 1991 hailstorm did about 
  US$240 million (CDN$340 million) damage in Calgary. Hailstorms account for more 
  than half of the catastrophic events in this region. In the Alberta program, 
  storms with the potential to generate hail damage are intensively treated through 
  cloud seeding. Since the program began, there has been an increase in the number 
  of potential hailstorms, yet a pronounced reduction in actual hail damage. Indeed, 
  during the first 4 years of the program, only one storm has done damage in the 
  area under supervision (IBC, 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Throughout the long history of hail suppression in North America and elsewhere, 
  success has been mixed (e.g., Changnon <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1978), so it is 
  not yet clear whether this approach will work over the long term. The experimental 
  program in Alberta is expected to continue indefinitely because the modest US$1 
  million (CDN$1.5 million) annual operating cost appears to be more than offset 
  by the reduction in observed hail damage (IBC, 2000).</p>
