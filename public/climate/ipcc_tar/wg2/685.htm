<h2>19.8. Conclusions </h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on certain reasons for concern with regard to what might 
  be considered a "dangerous" climate change (reported as increases in global 
  mean temperature; see <a href="660.htm">Section 19.1.2</a>). Each reason for 
  concern can be used by itself or in combination with other reasons for concern 
  to examine different aspects of vulnerability to climate change. We offer no 
  judgment about how to use some or all of these reasons for concern to determine 
  what is a dangerous level of climate change. The reasons for concern are as 
  follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and damage to 
    or irreparable loss of unique and threatened systems</li>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and the distribution 
    of impacts</li>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and globally 
    aggregated impacts</li>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and the probability 
    of extreme weather events</li>
  <li> The relationship between greenhouse concentrations and the probability 
    of large-scale singular events. </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, we address what observed effects of climate change tell us with 
  regard to Article 2 of the UNFCCC. We review the state of knowledge with regard 
  to what observations and each reason for concern tell us about climate change 
  impacts. </p>
<h3><a name="1981"></a>19.8.1. Observations</h3>
<p>Based on a review of the literature of observations of climate change impacts, 
  as reflected in other TAR chapters, we conclude:</p>
<p><ul><li> Statistically significant associations between trends in regional climate 
  and impacts have been documented in ~10 physical processes and ~450 biological 
  species, in terrestrial and marine environments on all continents. Although 
  the presence of multiple factors (e.g., land-use change, pollution, biotic invasion) 
  makes attribution of observed impacts to regional climate change difficult, 
  more than 90% (~99% physical, ~80% biophysical) of the changes documented worldwide 
  are consistent with how physical and biological processes are known to respond 
  to climate. Based on expert judgment, we have high confidence that the overall 
  patterns and processes of observations reveal a widespread and coherent impact 
  of 20th-century climate changes on many physical and biological systems. <br>
  <li> Signals of regional climate change impacts may be clearer in physical 
  and biological systems than in socioeconomic systems, which also are simultaneously 
  undergoing many complex changes that are not related to climate, such as population 
  growth and urbanization. There are preliminary indications that some social 
  and economic systems have been affected in part by 20th-century regional climate 
  changes (e.g., increased damages from flooding and droughts in some locations). 
  It generally is difficult to separate climate change effects from coincident 
  or alternative explanations for such observed regional impacts.</ul>
<p>There is preliminary evidence that unique and threatened systems are beginning 
  to be affected by regional climate change and that some systems have been affected 
  by recent increases in extreme climate events in some areas. Many high-latitude 
  and high-altitude systems are displaying the effects of regional climate change. 
  It is difficult to define observed impacts at aggregate levels, and evidence 
  of large-scale singular events occurring as a result of recent climate change 
  is lacking.</p>
