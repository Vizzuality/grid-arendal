<h3>14.1.4. Environmental Legislation </h3>
<p>Ratification of international and regional conventions and agreements brings 
  the responsibilities and commitments associated with them into the text of national 
  legislation. As a consequence, ratification of the recommendations of the United 
  Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992) by Latin American 
  governments has initiated a path for preventive actions for natural hazards, 
  as well as other recommendations included in Agenda 21 to be incorporated into 
  national legislation. The same is true for the United Nations Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, and 
  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and Drought. This also 
  has been the case with the adoption of the Vienna Convention on the Protection 
  of the Stratospheric Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol. Similar steps will 
  be needed should the Kyoto Protocol be ratified. The UNFCCC, particularly Articles 
  2 and 4, calls for action vis-&agrave;-vis climate variations, and the Kyoto 
  Protocol opens avenues for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; through 
  Article 12, on Clean Development Mechanisms, the UNFCCC makes provision for 
  assistance and transfer of technology from Annex I to non- Annex I Parties.</p>
<p>There also are a substantial number of regional agreements and a huge body 
  of laws, rules, and regulations to ensure systematic and coordinated actions 
  for protecting the environment, including flora and fauna and coastal and inland 
  wetlands, as well as to promote sustainable development (PNUMA, 1991; Bertucci 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Solano, 1997). Most Latin American governments have a comprehensive 
  environmental legal framework with relevant laws, rules, and procedures for 
  specific resources and activities (e.g., water, forestry and mineral resources, 
  marine resources and coastal areas, hunting and fishing, and tourism, as well 
  as specific products and pesticides and pollution) (Sebastiani <i>et al.</i>, 
  1991, 1996a,b). Latin American governments also have developed national and 
  regional environmental plans and strategies, as well as other sectoral or special 
  programs. Although implementation in some countries is far from satisfactory, 
  it also is very common to find legislation that regulates the use of natural 
  resources and makes provision to punish noncompliance (Solano, 1997). In a large 
  number of countries in the region, recent legal developments on environmental 
  management include mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies. 
  All Latin American countries are expected to adopt this policy. With regard 
  to the climate component, the main shortcomings highlighted in the report to 
  the IPCC Bureau on Systematic Observations are lack of sufficiently dense terrestrial 
  and marine observing systems; lack of systematic observations on specific biological 
  variables and socioeconomic impacts, as well as GHGs and aerosols; and consolidation 
  of land surface observations (hydrology, ecosystems, and land use) (WMO, 1998). 
  This means that, generally speaking, there are limitations that affect the value 
  and reliability of EIAs in some areas of the region. </p>
<p>In line with United Nations Resolution A/52/629&#151;which calls for cooperation 
  to incorporate sustainable development programs at national, regional and global 
  levels&#151;countries in Latin America are engaged in fulfilling the objectives 
  of such development programs. In this respect, policymakers and decisionmakers 
  should be made aware of the role played by climate variation issues in such 
  development strategies. The large majority of countries follow the recommendations 
  made by the United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development (UNCSD), and 
  the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is assisting 
  them in integrating relevant disciplines and sectors, particularly for incorporating 
  natural hazard response strategies in sustainable development policies. However, 
  more work still is needed, as a result of the aforementioned shortcomings in 
  the operation of observing and monitoring systems as well as the need for capacity-building 
  on issues related to sustainable development and their well-known linkages with 
  climate issues. Such action becomes relevant to efforts for mitigating environmental 
  hazards and acting in line with the planning of the Pan-American Climate Information 
  and Applications System (PACIS), as suggested by the Summit of the Americas 
  in Santiago, Chile, in 1998.</p>
<p>As environmental concerns become more pressing, they are climbing higher on 
  the international political agenda. Globalization in its many guises poses an 
  enormous challenge for traditional governance structures. While nations&#151;particularly 
  developing nations&#151;are losing ground in globalization, other actors are 
  moving to the forefront, particularly international corporations and nongovernmental 
  organizations (NGOs). Therefore, governments should not only take into account 
  this new spectrum of participants in future environmental legislation but, above 
  all, give them specific and urgently required roles in defense of the environment. 
  New information and communication technologies are facilitating international 
  networking, and activist groups, businesses, and international institutions 
  are forging innovative partnership.</p>
