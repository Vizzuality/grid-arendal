<h3>2.4.2 The State of the Art </h3>
<p>Treatment of impacts in these models also varies greatly. Generally, however, 
  impacts are one of the weakest parts of IAMs. To a large extent this is a reflection 
  of the state of the art of the underlying research, but it also reflects the 
  high complexity of the task at hand (see Tol and Fankhauser, 1998, for a survey). 
  Despite the growing number of country-level case studies, our knowledge about 
  climate change and climate change impacts at the regional level remains limited. 
  A coherent global picture, based on a uniform set of assumptions, has yet to 
  emerge. The basis of most global impact assessments remain studies undertaken 
  in developed countries (often the United States), which are then extrapolated 
  to other regions. Such extrapolation is difficult and will be successful only 
  if regional circumstances are carefully taken into account, including differences 
  in geography, level of development, value systems, and adaptive capacity. Not 
  all analyses are equally careful in undertaking this task, and not all models 
  rely on the latest available information in calibrating their damage functions. 
</p>
<p>The actual functional relationships applied in many integrated models remain 
  simple and often ad hoc. This reflects our still poor understanding of how impacts 
  change over time and as a function of climate parameters. Impacts usually are 
  a linear or exponential function of absolute temperature, calibrated around 
  static "snapshot" estimates (such as 2xCO<sub>2</sub>) without distinguishing 
  the different dynamics that may govern impacts in different sectors. Developing 
  a better understanding of these relationships is one of the most important challenges 
  for integrated model development. </p>
<p>Baseline trends&#151;such as economic development, population growth, technological 
  progress, changes in values, natural climate fluctuations, and increased stress 
  on natural ecosystems&#151;have strong repercussions for climate change vulnerability 
  (e.g., Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999). They must be better understood and their 
  effect incorporated in the models. Unfortunately, these trends are inherently 
  difficult, if not impossible, to predict over the longer term. This generic 
  problem will not go away, but it can be overcome, at least partly, through broad 
  scenario and sensitivity analysis. </p>
<p>Another key challenge is taking adaptation into account. Adaptation can significantly 
  reduce people's vulnerability to climate change, as shown in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>. However, adaptation can take many different forms and is correspondingly 
  difficult to model (see <a href="673.htm">Section 19.4</a>). To date there are 
  no IAMs available that can adequately represent or guide the full range of adaptation 
  decisions.</p>
