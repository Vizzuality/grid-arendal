<h3>3.2.3. Constructing Socioeconomic Scenarios</h3>
<p>Socioeconomic scenarios can be constructed in the same variety of ways and 
  for the same variety of purposes as global change scenarios in general. In practice, 
  a variety of approaches may be combined in a single exercise. The UNEP country 
  studies program has developed detailed guidance on construction and use of socioeconomic 
  scenarios (Tol, 1998). This guidance emphasizes the importance of avoiding simple 
  extrapolation-especially for developing countries, which may be undergoing demographic 
  or economic transition; the role of formal modeling in filling in, but not defining, 
  scenarios; and the role of expert judgment in blending disparate elements into 
  coherent and plausible scenarios.</p>
<p>Most socioeconomic scenarios cover several different topics or domains, such 
  as population or economic activity. <a href="127.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a> shows 
  the range of issues covered in recent scenario or scenario-based exercises.</p>
<h4><a name="3231"></a>3.2.3.1. Basic Drivers </h4>
<p>Population and economic activity are characterized in quantitative terms in 
  most scenario exercises. The degree of disaggregation according to world region, 
  country, or sector varies from one study to another. Coverage of other socioeconomic 
  domains also can vary markedly among different activities.</p>
<h4><a name="3232"></a>3.2.3.2. Underlying Socioeconomic Drivers</h4>
<p>Some scenarios incorporate explicit assumptions about underlying socioeconomic 
  drivers of change such as social values and governance institutions. These scenarios 
  usually are generated through synthetic or expert judgment-led approaches, expressed 
  in qualitative terms. Social values can affect the willingness of societies 
  to preserve ecosystems or protect biodiversity. Institutional and governance 
  factors affect the capacity of a society to organize and direct the resources 
  needed to reduce climate vulnerability (Adger, 1999). Qualitative factors such 
  as institutional effectiveness and social values are key determinants of the 
  effectiveness of coping strategies for adapting to climate change (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>). They determine adaptive capacity and hence the vulnerability of socioeconomic 
  systems. They are critical in any assessment of the implications of climate 
  change for development, equity, and sustainability (Munasinghe, 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="3233"></a>3.2.3.3. Technological Change</h4>
<p>Technology critically affects the capacity to adapt to climate change; it confers 
  opportunities and risks. For example, genetic modification of crops and other 
  developments in agricultural technology could enhance that sector's ability 
  to adapt to different climatic conditions. However, excessive reliance on one 
  particular strain of plant might increase vulnerability.</p>
<p>Technological change must be characterized in quantitative and qualitative 
  terms. It may be very difficult to identify specific features of a technology 
  that could affect vulnerability to climate change. Expert judgments are needed 
  about the direction in which change takes place, public acceptability of different 
  options, and the rate of adoption in the marketplace. Quantitative assumptions 
  will be needed about the rate of improvement of a technology, including its 
  cost, overall efficiency in using resources to meet the need for a given service, 
  and possible impacts at various scales.</p>
