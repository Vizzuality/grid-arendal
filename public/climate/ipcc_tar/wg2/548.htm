<h4>Marine Fisheries</h4>
<p>Climate-related variations in the marine environment&#151;including changes 
  in sea-surface temperatures, nutrient supply, and circulation dynamics&#151;play 
  an important role in determining the productivity of several North American 
  fisheries (high confidence).</p>
<p>Projected climate changes have the potential to affect coastal and marine ecosystems, 
  with impacts on the abundance and spatial distribution of species that are important 
  to commercial and recreational fisheries. The degree of impact is likely to 
  vary within a wide range, depending on species and community characteristics 
  and region-specific conditions. These impacts are complex and difficult to observe, 
  so climate variability constitutes a significant source of uncertainty for fishery 
  managers. Recent experiences with Pacific salmon and Atlantic cod suggests that 
  sustainable fisheries management will require timely and accurate scientific 
  information on environmental conditions that affect fish stocks, as well as 
  institutional flexibility to respond quickly to such information.</p>
<h4><a name="10"></a>Human Health </h4>
<p>Increased frequency and severity of heat waves may lead to an increase in illness 
  and death, particularly among young, elderly, and frail people, especially in 
  large urban centers. The net effect of reduced severity of extreme cold is likely 
  to have a beneficial effect. Acclimatization may be slower than the rate of 
  ambient temperature change.<br>
</p>
<p>Increased frequency of convective storms could lead to more cases of thunderstorm-associated 
  asthma. More frequent flood events and other extreme events may result in an 
  increase in deaths, injuries, infectious diseases, and stress-related disorders, 
  as well as other adverse health effects associated with social disruption, environmentally 
  forced migration, and settlement in urban slums.<br>
</p>
<p>Vector-borne diseases, including malaria and dengue fever, may expand their 
  ranges in the United States and may develop in Canada. Tick-borne Lyme disease 
  also may also expand its range in Canada. However, socioeconomic factors such 
  as public health measures will play a large role in determining the existence 
  or extent of such infections. Diseases associated with water may increase with 
  warming of air and water temperatures, combined with heavy runoff events from 
  agricultural and urban surfaces.<br>
</p>
<p>Respiratory disorders may be exacerbated by warming-induced increases in the 
  frequency of smog (ground-level ozone) events, acidic deposition, and particulate 
  air pollution.</p>
<h4><a name="11"></a>Human Settlements and Infrastructure </h4>
<p>Potential impacts of climate change on cities include fewer periods of extreme 
  winter cold; increased frequency of extreme heat; rising sea levels and risk 
  of storm surge; and changes in timing, frequency, and severity of flooding associated 
  with storms and precipitation extremes. </p>
<p>Communities can reduce their vulnerability to potential adverse impacts from 
  climate change through investments in adaptive infrastructure. These adaptations 
  can be expensive. Rural, poor, and indigenous communities may not be able to 
  make such investments. Furthermore, infrastructure investment decisions often 
  are based on a variety of needs beyond climate change, including population 
  growth and aging of existing systems.<br>
</p>
<p>Changes in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme events may be among 
  the most important risks associated with climate change. The rising cost of 
  natural disasters in North America illustrates the vulnerability of current 
  settlement practices. Human alterations of natural systems&#151;such as drainage 
  basins, barrier islands, and coastal margins&#151;influence the impact of extreme 
  weather hazards. Adaptations such as levees and dams often are successful in 
  managing most variations in the weather, but they can increase vulnerability 
  to the most extreme events.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="12"></a>Tourism</h4>
<p>Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns would lead to shifts in outdoor 
  tourism and recreation opportunities (e.g., winter sports, fishing, parks, beaches). 
  The extent to which ecological changes in parks will affect tourism is uncertain. 
  Future shifts in water management, in response to development pressures as well 
  as climate change, also could affect recreational opportunities and associated 
  property values. Opportunities and challenges for recreational industries and 
  destination areas need to be assessed in a systematic manner before net economic 
  impacts can be reported with sufficient confidence.</p>
