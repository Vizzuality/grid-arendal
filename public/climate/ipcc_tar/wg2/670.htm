<h4><a name="19334"></a>19.3.3.4. Coral Reefs </h4>
<p>Coral reefs are restricted to narrow latitudinal, horizontal, and vertical 
  ranges along the tropical continental shelves. Their contribution to global 
  coastal biodiversity is disproportionate to their spatial extent: Although they 
  cover less than 1% of the world's oceans, they are inhabited by one-third of 
  globally known marine species (Reaka-Kudla, 1996). Coral reefs have far-reaching 
  effects; they are nurseries for many ocean fish species, and they protect coastlines 
  from wave impact and erosion (see <a href="443.htm">Section 11.2.4.3</a>). Thus, 
  fisheries, tourism, infrastructures, societies, and cultures depend on the well-being 
  of this unique entity that is impacted by increased temperature, atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub>, and sea level, synergistically combined with anthropogenic stresses 
  that are independent of climate change.</p>
<p>Many reef-building coral species already live close to their upper thermal 
  limit (see <a href="295.htm#645">Section 6.4.5</a>). If they are exposed to 
  moderate increases (1-2&deg;C) in water temperature, they become stressed and 
  experience bleaching (Goreau et al., 1998; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). The increasing 
  frequency of coral bleaching events during the past decade provides a reason 
  for concern for this warming-induced impact. For example, 50-90% bleaching-induced mortality in the Indian 
  Ocean reefs was associated with a 2-6&deg;C above-normal sea-surface maximum 
  triggered by El Ni&ntilde;o during 1997-1998; several other severe bleaching 
  events occurred in the 1982-1983 and 1987 El Ni&ntilde;o years (Glynn, 1991; 
  Wilkinson et al., 1999; see <a href="#fig193">Figure 19-3</a>).</p>
<table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

      <b>Figure 19-3:</b> Bleaching of coral reefs reported from 1997 to 1998

</table>
<p><a name="fig193"></a>Defining the upper thermal thresholds of corals and using 
  global warming scenarios, Hoegh-Guldberg (1999) found that the frequency of 
  bleaching is expected to rise until they become annual events in most oceans 
  (at about a 1&deg;C warming). In some areas, bleaching events would happen more 
  frequently as early as 2020 (with less than 0.5&deg;C warming); within the next 
  30-50 years, bleaching could be triggered by normal seasonal changes in 
  seawater temperature, and most regions may experience severe bleaching conditions 
  every year. This trend exceeds the frequency at which corals can effectively 
  recover from bleaching-related mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999).</p>
<p>Besides the detrimental effect of temperature rise, increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations reduce coral calcification rates (Gattuso et al., 1999; Kleypas 
  et al., 1999; see <a href="295.htm#645">Section 6.4.5</a>), which already might 
  have decreased and could decrease an additional 10-30% by 2100 (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). A 10-20% decrease in calcium carbonate production may impair expansion 
  of coral reefs into higher latitudes as a response to predicted increasing SST 
  (Kleypas et al., 1999). Healthy reef flats may benefit from projected increased 
  sea level because they would be able to keep up with the projected rise in sea 
  level. However, any increase in the frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o and other ocean-atmosphere 
  interactions, such as Indian Ocean dipole events, will lead to regular and prolonged 
  sea-level depressions (10-40 cm) in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean, 
  with adverse effects on shallow reefs in their regions (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). </p>
<h4><a name="19335"></a>19.3.3.5. Mangrove Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Mangrove ecosystems resemble coral reefs in that they have a narrow global 
  distribution: They cover 11,500 km<sup>2</sup> in all of Australia, and the 
  largest mangrove forest in the world&#151;the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India&#151;covers 
  6,000 km<sup>2</sup> (see <a href="441.htm#11241">Section 11.2.4.1</a>). Yet 
  they have a rich biodiversity and a significant effect on adjacent and distant 
  systems. Mangroves are made up of salt-adapted, intertidal evergreen trees on 
  low-energy, sedimentary tropical shorelines, extending landward in lagoons, 
  estuary margins, and tidal rivers (see <a href="294.htm#644">Sections 6.4.4</a> 
  and <a href="441.htm#11241">11.2.4.1</a>).</p>
<p>Mangrove ecosystems are highly vulnerable to sea-level rise induced by climate 
  change, which will change the salinity distribution and inundate mangroves. 
  For example, a 45-cm rise could inundate 75% of the Sundarbans (see <a href="459.htm#1141">Section 
  11.4.1</a>); a 1-m rise will completely inundate the Sundarbans (see <a href="432.htm">Section 
  11.2.1.6</a>). In addition, redistribution of species whose habitats will be 
  affected by inundation may be impaired because migration, especially to the 
  north, will be blocked by human settlements. Loss of productivity, species, 
  and ecosystem goods and services therefore is expected. Climate change effects 
  will be further exacerbated, and vulnerability to climate change will increase 
  human-induced damage. For example, between 56 and 75% of different Asian mangrove 
  forests have been lost during the 20th century because of overexploitation and 
  replacement by aquaculture installations (see <a href="421.htm">Section 11.1.3.1</a>). 
  Like the Sundarbans, the Port Royal mangrove wetland in Jamaica may completely 
  collapse with a 1-m sea-level rise (see <a href="629.htm">Section 17.2.4.2</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, although mangroves are vulnerable, some may be adaptable 
  to climate change because they could survive in areas where vertical accretion 
  equals sea-level rise. Because sediment flux determines mangrove response to 
  sea-level rise and fluxes vary between regions and locations, the fate of the 
  world's mangrove ecosystems will not be uniform (see <a href="294.htm#644">Section 
  6.4.4</a>). Yet even where accretion will offset sea-level rise, any infrastructure 
  will limit the potential for landward migration of coastal mangrove species 
  and habitats (see <a href="286.htm">Section 6.2</a>). Thus, at least some if 
  not many of the world's mangrove ecosystems are unique and threatened entities.</p>
