      <b>Figure 19-4:</b> Monetary impacts as a function of level of climate change 
      (measured as percentage of global GDP). Although there is confidence that 
      higher magnitudes and rates of increase in global mean temperature will 
      lead to increasing damages, there is uncertainty about whether aggregate 
      damages are positive or negative at relatively low increases in global mean 
      temperature. </td>

<p><a name="fig194"></a>One of the main challenges of impact assessments is to 
  move from the static analysis of certain benchmarks to a dynamic representation 
  of impacts as a function of shifting climatic parameters, adaptation measures, 
  and exogenous trends such as economic and population growth. Little progress 
  has been made in this respect, and our understanding of the time path that aggregate 
  impacts will follow under different warming and development scenarios still 
  is extremely limited. Among the few explicitly dynamic analyses are Sohngen 
  and Mendelsohn (1999) and Yohe et al. (1996). </p>
<p>Some information about impacts over time is available for individual sectors. 
  Scenarios derived from IAMs can provide comprehensive emissions, concentrations, 
  and climate change estimates that can be linked to impact models. Table 19-5 
  summarizes estimates of global ecosystem impacts that were derived from such 
  a model (IMAGE 2.1&#151;Leemans et al., 1998; Swart et al., 1998). The metric 
  used is percentage change. The example illustrates the clearly nonlinear dynamics 
  of nonmarket impacts with different pathways for positive (escalating) and negative 
  (saturating) impacts. The impact levels in this model evolve gradually, and 
  there are impacts even at low levels of climate change. Although this finding 
  is consistent with observed change (see Section 19.2), it is sensitive to the 
  choice of metric. White et al. (1999), for example, found that carbon storage 
  in terrestrial vegetation would expand under moderate warming because increases 
  in productivity are enough to offset reductions elsewhere. They show that as 
  higher GHG concentrations and magnitudes of climate change are reached, carbon 
  storage eventually will decline.</p>
<p>Little is known about the shape of the aggregate impact function. Dynamic functions 
  remain highly speculative at this point because the underlying models provide 
  only a very rough reflection of real-world complexities. <a href="#fig194">Figure 
  19-4</a> provides examples from three studies. Although some analysts still 
  work with relatively smooth impact functions (e.g., Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000), 
  there is growing recognition (e.g., Mendelsohn and Schlesinger, 1997; Tol, 2001c) 
  that climate change dynamics in fact might be more complex and may not follow 
  a monotonic path. Generic patterns that are emerging include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Moderate climate change may have positive and negative effects, with most 
    positive effects occurring in the market sector of developed countries. For 
    higher levels of warming, impacts are likely to become predominantly negative. 
    However, the overall pattern is complex, estimates remain uncertain, and the 
    possibility of highly deleterious outcomes cannot be excluded (medium confidence).<br>
  <li> Impacts in different sectors may unfold along different paths. Coastal 
    impacts, for example, are expected to grow continuously over time, more or 
    less in proportion to the rise in sea level. The prospects for agriculture, 
    by contrast, are more complex. Whereas some models predict aggregate damages 
    already for moderate warming, many studies suggest that under some (but not 
    all) scenarios the impact curve might be hump-shaped, with short-term (aggregate) 
    benefits under modest climate change turning into losses under more substantial 
    change (e.g., Mendelsohn and Schlesinger, 1997) (low confidence). 
</ul>
<p>Aggregating intertemporal impacts into a single indicator is extremely difficult, 
  perhaps elusive. The marginal damages caused by 1 t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  in the near future were estimated in the SAR at US$5-125 t-1 C. Most estimates 
  are in the lower part of that range; higher estimates occur only through the 
  combination of high vulnerability with a low discount rate (see Pearce et al., 
  1996). Plambeck and Hope (1996), Eyre et al. (1997), and Tol (1999a) have since 
  reassessed the marginal costs of GHG emissions. Performing extensive sensitivity 
  and uncertainty analyses, they arrive at essentially the same range of numbers 
  as Pearce et al. (1996). In the complex dynamics that determine marginal damage 
  costs, the more optimistic estimates of market damages used in recent studies 
  are balanced out by other factors such as higher nonmarket impacts and a better 
  capture of uncertainties. Overall, the SAR assessment still is a good reflection 
  of our understanding of marginal damage costs; our confidence in marginal damage 
  numbers remains very low.</p>
