<h3>2.3.7. What Recent Progress has been Made in Assessing Adaptive Capacity?</h3>
<p>In recent years, assessment of adaptive capacity has emerged as a critical 
  focus of attention, for two reasons: the realization that the Kyoto Protocol 
  is inadequate to prevent substantial changes in climate, and the rising expectation 
  that social and natural systems can cope with climate change, at least within 
  limits, and that adaptation is a viable option to reduce GHG emissions. </p>
<p>Although there are numerous examples of model calculations for adaptive shifts 
  in flora, far less attention has been paid to assessing the adaptability of 
  the system as a whole (e.g., White <i>et al</i>., 1999). In contrast with other 
  phenomena, such as changes in the water cycle, changes in natural ecosystems 
  are related to a long-term process of adaptation and extinction. As noted above, 
  transient climate change scenarios have become a mainstream research procedure.</p>
<p>The recent literature concerned with the impacts of climate change on the managed 
  environment [e.g., on agriculture (see <a href="208.htm">Section 5.3</a>) and 
  coastal zones (see <a href="303.htm">Section 6.7</a>)] generally considers adaptive 
  strategies (e.g., Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Water management, for example, 
  has a long history of evaluation of strategies for adapting to climate change 
  and variation (Frederick <i>et a</i>l., 1997). However, adaptation often is 
  approached narrowly in terms of technological options. Adaptation processes&#151;including 
  the environmental, behavioral, economic, institutional, and cultural factors 
  that serve as barriers or incentives to adaptation over time&#151;often are 
  not considered. </p>
<p>Five methodological directions could enhance future work on adaptation (see 
  <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>). First, methods for increasing understanding 
  of the relationship between adaptation, individual decisionmaking, and local 
  conditions are required. For example, adaptation by farmers could avoid more 
  than half of the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture (e.g., Darwin 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995; El-Shaer <i>et al</i>., 1997). The mix of appropriate measures 
  depends, however, on the local context of soils, climates, economic infrastructure, 
  and other resources (Rosenzweig and Tubiello, 1997) and how they are perceived 
  by farmers. Assessments of adaptation could address these issues of site-scale 
  characteristics and local knowledge, perhaps through participatory methods (e.g., 
  Cohen, 1997, 1998) or interviews and expert opinion (as in the UK Climate Impacts 
  Programme&#151;Mackenzie-Hedger <i>et al</i>., 2000; see &lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ukcip.org">http://www.ukcip.org</a>&gt;).</p>
<p>Second, interactions across scale are likely to be significant for adaptation. 
  In the agricultural sector, for example, adaptive strategies are influenced 
  by multi-scale factors&#151;at the farm, national, and global levels&#151;and 
  their integration into decisionmaking. Methods and tools for examining these 
  multi-scale interactions and their implications for adaptation are required, 
  such as multi-level modeling (Easterling <i>et al.</i>, 1998), integrated assessment 
  (<a href="090.htm">see Section 2.4</a>), and agent-based simulation (Downing 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Third, specific measures (such as changing planting dates and cultivars) and 
  longer term adaptation strategies and processes (such as monitoring and research) 
  need to be addressed. Many studies focus on the former; assessing the latter 
  is a major methodological challenge.</p>
<p>Fourth, comparative frameworks are required for assessing the priority of adaptation 
  strategies across populations, regions, and sectors, in addition to evaluating 
  specific measures. Fankhauser (1998) devised a list of adaptation policy options, 
  discussed conceptual issues of economic evaluation, and illustrated typical 
  cost/benefit calculation methods. <a href="093.htm">Section 2.5</a> considers 
  the use of economic evaluation methods, but nonmonetary frameworks are alternatives 
  (see Huq <i>et al</i>., 1999, for a case example). Issues of equity and valuation 
  on indirect benefits and costs are salient.</p>
<p>Fifth, adaptation to extremes and variability already are important areas of 
  assessment (see above) but need to be more explicitly tied to longer term climate 
  change.</p>
<p>Sixth, stakeholder evaluation of adaptation strategies and measures is required&#151;for 
  example, using decision analytical tools, as noted in <a href="112.htm">Section 
  2.7</a>. Indicators of vulnerability could be used to monitor the effectiveness 
  of adaptative strategies and measures (see Downing <i>et al</i>., 2001)</p>
