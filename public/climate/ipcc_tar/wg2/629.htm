<h4><a name="17242"></a>17.2.4.2. Mangroves</h4>
<p>Mangroves provide important functions as protection against storms, tides, 
  cyclones, and storm surges and are used as "filters" against the introduction 
  of pests and exotic insects (Menendez and Priego, 1994; Suman, 1994). Mangroves 
  have important ecological and socioeconomic functions as well, particularly 
  in relation to animal and plant productivity, as nutrient sinks, for substrate 
  stabilization, and as a source of wood products. These functions sometimes may 
  be in conflict and differ in importance between riverine, basin, and coastal 
  fringe mangroves; the latter are important primarily for shoreline protection.</p>
<p>Many mangrove forests are under stress from excessive exploitation, reducing 
  resilience in the face of sea-level rise. The importance of sediment flux in 
  determining mangrove response to rising sea levels is well established in the 
  literature. Ellison and Stoddart (1991), Ellison (1993), and Parkinson and Delaune 
  (1994) have suggested that mangrove accretion in low- and high-island settings 
  with low sediment supply may not be able to keep up with future rates of sea-level 
  rise, but Snedaker and Meeder (1994) have suggested that low-island mangroves 
  may be able to accommodate much higher rates. These observations may not necessarily 
  represent conflicting views because the resilience of mangroves to sea-level 
  rise also is conditioned by the composition and status of the stands and other 
  factors such as tidal range and sediment supply (Woodroffe, 1995; Ewel <i>et 
  al., </i>1998; Farnsworth, 1998). In some protected coastal settings, inundation 
  of low-lying coastal land actually may promote progressive expansion of mangrove 
  forest with rising sea level (Richmond <i>et al.,</i> 1997), provided vertical 
  accretion keeps pace.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, studies have shown that mangrove forests in 
  some small islands will be lost as a result of elevated sea levels. For example, 
  it is projected that with a 1-m sea-level rise in Cuba, more than 300 ha of 
  mangroves, representing approximately 3% of that country's forests, would 
  be at risk (Perez <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Under similar conditions, Alleng (1998) 
  projects a complete collapse of the Port Royal mangrove wetland in Jamaica, 
  which has shown little capacity to migrate in the past 300 years; Suman (1994) 
  envisages that accelerated sea-level rise would adversely affect mangroves in 
  Puerto Rico, where 62% already has been eliminated by direct human activity. 
</p>
<h4>17.2.4.3. Seagrasses<a name="17243"></a></h4>
<p>Seagrass communities provide useful habitat for many marine fish, particularly 
  in the shallow, intertidal environments of many islands. It is postulated that 
  an increase in SST will adversely affect seagrass communities because these 
  ecosystems already are sensitive to land-based pollution and runoff in coastal 
  environments (Edwards, 1995). It is argued further that the distribution of 
  seagrasses will shift as a result of temperature stress, which in turn can cause 
  changes in sexual reproduction patterns (Short and Neckles, 1999). In addition, 
  an increase in temperature will alter seagrasses' growth rates and other 
  physiological functions. Sea-level rise would mean increasing water depth and 
  reduction of the amount of light reaching the seagrass beds, which would reduce 
  plant productivity.</p>
<p>The effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the water column will vary according 
  to species and environmental circumstances but will likely alter the competition 
  between species, as well as between seagrasses and algal populations (Beer and 
  Koch, 1996). Laboratory experiments suggest that some seagrasses, such as <i>Zostera 
  marina, </i>are able to respond positively to increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels 
  by increasing their rate of photosynthesis (Zimmerman <i>et al.,</i> 1997), 
  although earlier research on field-collected samples of <i>Thallassia testudinum</i> 
  suggests that maximum photosynthesis is lower with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Durako, 
  1993).</p>
<p>As with other submerged aquatic plants, seagrasses are sensitive to ultraviolet-B 
  (UV-B) radiation because such radiation can penetrate depths of up to 10 m (Larkum 
  and Wood, 1993). Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the response 
  can vary from strong photosynthetic tolerance, in the case of<i> Halophila wrightii;</i> 
  to moderate tolerance, as with <i>Syringodium filiforme;</i> to little photosynthetic 
  tolerance, as exhibited by <i>Halophila engelmanni</i> (Hader, 1993; Short and 
  Neckles, 1999). </p>
