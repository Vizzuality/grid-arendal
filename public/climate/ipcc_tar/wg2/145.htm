<h4>3.5.4.3. Constructing Change Fields</h4>
<p>Because climate model results generally are not sufficiently accurate (in terms 
  of absolute values) at regional scales to be used directly (Mearns <i>et al</i>., 
  1997), mean differences between the control (or current climate) run and the 
  future climate run usually are calculated and then combined with some baseline 
  observed climate data set (IPCC, 1994). Conventionally, differences (future 
  climate minus control) are used for temperature variables, and ratios (future 
  climate/control) are used for other variables such as precipitation, solar radiation, 
  relative humidity, and windspeed. Most impact applications consider one or more 
  fixed time horizon(s) in the future (e.g., the 2020s, the 2050s, and the 2080s 
  have been chosen as 30-year time windows for storing change fields in the IPCC-DDC). 
  Some other applications may require time-dependent information on changes, such 
  as vegetation succession models that simulate transient changes in plant composition 
  (e.g., VEMAP members, 1995).</p>
<h4><a name="3544"></a>3.5.4.4. Spatial Scale of Scenarios</h4>
<p>One of the major problems in applying GCM projections to regional impact assessments 
  is the coarse spatial scale of the gridded estimates&#151;on the order of hundreds 
  of kilometers&#151;in relation to many of the exposure units being studied (often 
  at one or two orders of magnitude finer resolution). Concern about this issue 
  is raised in <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="196.htm">5</a>. Several 
  solutions have been adopted to obtain finer resolution information.</p>
<h4><a name="35441"></a>3.5.4.4.1. Simple methods</h4>
<p>Conventionally, regional "detail" in climate scenarios has been incorporated 
  by appending changes in climate from the nearest coarse-scale GCM grid box to 
  the study area (observation point or region) (e.g., Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994) 
  or by interpolating from GCM grid box resolution to a higher resolution grid 
  or point location (Leemans and van den Born, 1994; Harrison and Butterfield, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Three major methods have been developed to produce higher resolution climate 
  scenarios at the sub-GCM grid scale: regional climate modeling (Giorgi and Mearns, 
  1991, 1999; McGregor, 1997), statistical downscaling (von Storch <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Rummukainen, 1997; Wilby and Wigley, 1997), and variable- and high-resolution 
  GCM experiments (Fox-Rabinovitz <i>et al</i>., 1997). All three methods are 
  presented in <a href="140.htm#tab34">Table 3-4</a> and discussed in detail in 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/373.htm">Chapter 10</a>, but we briefly 
  review here the first two, since they have been most commonly applied to impact 
  assessments. Both methods are dependent on large-scale circulation variables 
  from GCMs. Large-scale circulation refers to the general behavior of the atmosphere 
  at large (i.e., continental) scales.</p>
<h4><a name="35442"></a>3.5.4.4.2. Regional climate modeling</h4>
<p>The basic strategy with regional models is to rely on the GCM to reproduce 
  the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and to use the regional model, 
  run at a higher resolution, to simulate sub-GCM scale regional distributions 
  of climate. In numerous experiments with regional models driven by control and 
  doubled CO<sub>2</sub> output from GCMs for regions throughout the world, the 
  spatial pattern of changed climate&#151;particularly changes in precipitation&#151;simulated 
  by the regional model departs from the more general pattern over the same region 
  simulated by the GCM (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="35443"></a>3.5.4.4.3. Statistical methods</h4>
<p>Statistical methods are much less computationally demanding than dynamic methods; 
  they offer an opportunity to produce ensembles of high-resolution climate scenarios 
  (for reviews, see von Storch, 1995; Wilby and Wigley, 1997). However, these 
  techniques rely on the (questionable) assumption that observed statistical relationships 
  will continue to be valid under future radiative forcing&#151;that is, they 
  are time-invariant (Wilby, 1997). </p>
<p>Although regional modeling and statistical techniques have been available for 
  at least a decade&#151;their developers claiming use in impact assessments as 
  one of their important applications&#151;it is only recently that they have 
  actually provided scenarios for impact assessments (Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1998, 
  1999, 2001; S&aelig;lthun <i>et al</i>., 1998; Hay <i>et al</i>., 1999; Brown 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Whetton <i>et al</i>., 2001). Mearns <i>et al</i>. (1999, 
  2001) demonstrate that a high-resolution scenario results in agricultural impacts 
  that differ from those produced with a coarser resolution GCM scenario (discussed 
  in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Hay <i>et al</i>. (1999) found differences 
  in runoff calculations, based on a GCM-scenario and a statistically downscaled 
  scenario. </p>
