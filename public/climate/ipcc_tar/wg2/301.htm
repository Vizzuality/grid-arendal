<h3>6.6.2. Resilience and Vulnerability</h3>
<p>In the context of climate change and coastal management, vulnerability is now 
  a familiar concept. On the other hand, the concept of coastal resilience is 
  less well known but has become much more important in recent years (<a href="297.htm#box6-5">Box 
  6-5</a>). Coastal resilience has ecological, morphological, and socioeconomic 
  components, each of which represents another aspect of the coastal system's 
  adaptive capacity to external disturbances. We have identified several natural 
  features that contribute to resilience of the shore-zone by providing ecological 
  buffers, including coral reefs, salt marsh, and mangrove forest and morphological 
  protection in the form of sand and gravel beaches, barriers, and coastal dunes. 
</p>
<p>Socioeconomic resilience is the capability of a society to prevent or cope 
  with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise, including technical, 
  institutional, economic, and cultural ability (as indicated in <a href="297.htm#box6-5">Box 
  6-5</a>). Enhancing this resilience is equivalent to reducing the risk of the 
  impacts on society. This resilience can be strengthened mainly by decreasing 
  the probability of occurrence of hazard (managed retreat or protection); avoiding 
  or reducing its potential effects (accommodation or protection), and facilitating 
  recovery from the damages when impacts occur. Among these options, managed retreat 
  has gained some prominence in the past 2 decades (see <a href="#box6-6">Box 
  6-6</a>); Clark (1998) has argued that flood insurance is an appropriate management 
  strategy to enhance coastal resilience in the UK.</p>
<p>Technological capacity is a component of social and economic resilience, although 
  adaptation strategies may involve more than engineering measures. Technological 
  options can be implemented efficiently only in an appropriate economic, institutional, 
  legal, and sociocultural context. A list of technologies that could be effective 
  for adaptation appears in Klein <i>et al.</i> (2000). Indigenous (traditional) 
  technologies should be considered as an option to increase resilience and, to 
  be effective, must fit in with traditional social structures (Veitayaki, 1998; 
  Nunn <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Enhancing coastal resilience in these ways increasingly is regarded as an appropriate 
  way to prepare for uncertain future changes, while maintaining opportunities 
  for coastal development (although some tradeoffs are involved, and the political 
  discourse is challenging). In short, enhancing resilience is a potentially powerful 
  adaptive measure.</p>

      <p><b>Box 6-6. Adaptation through Managed Retreat</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Managed retreat generally is designed to avoid hazards and prevent ecosystems 
        from being squeezed between development and the advancing sea. The most 
        common mechanisms for managed retreat are <i>setbacks</i> that require 
        new development to be a minimum distance from the shore, <i>density restrictions</i> 
        that limit development, and <i>rolling easement</i> policies that allow 
        development on the condition that it be removed to enable wetlands to 
        migrate landward (Titus, 1998). These strategies may all become elements 
        of an integrated coastal management policy. Setback could be considered 
        a managed retreat strategy, particularly in cases in which the setback 
        line is shifted inland as the shoreline recedes. Other measures of managed 
        retreat can include conditional phased-out development, withdrawal of 
        government subsidies, and denial of flood insurance. </p>
      <p>Examples of managed retreat and related measures as adaptation to sea-level 
        rise include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Canada:</b> New Brunswick completed remapping of the entire coast 
          of the province to delineate the landward limit of coastal features. 
          Setback for new development is defined from this limit. Some other provinces 
          have adopted a variety of setback policies, based on estimates of future 
          coastal retreat. 
        <li><b>Barbados:</b> A national statute establishes a minimum building 
          setback along sandy coasts of 30 m from mean high-water mark; along 
          coastal cliffs the setback is 10 m from the undercut portion of the 
          cliff. 
        <li><b>Aruba and Antigua:</b> Setback established at 50 m inland from 
          high-water mark. 
        <li><b>Sri Lanka:</b> Setback areas and <i>no-build zones</i> identified 
          in Coastal Zone Management Plan. Minimum setbacks of 60 m from line 
          of mean sea level are regarded as good planning practice. 
        <li><b>United Kingdom:</b> House of Commons in 1998 endorsed the concept 
          of <i>managed realignment</i> as the preferred long-term strategy for 
          coastal defense in some areas. 
        <li><b>United States:</b> The states of Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
          and South Carolina have implemented various forms of <i>rolling easement</i> 
          policies to ensure that wetlands and beaches can migrate inland as sea 
          level rises. 
        <li><b>Australia:</b> Several states have coastal setback and minimum 
          elevation policies, including those to accommodate potential sea-level 
          rise and storm surge. In South Australia, setbacks take into account 
          the100-year erosional trend plus the effect of a 0.3-m sea-level rise 
          to 2050. Building sites should be above storm-surge flood level for 
          the 100-year return interval.

<h3>6.6.3. Adaptation in the Coastal Zone</h3>

</table>
<p><a name="fig6-1"></a>The purpose of adaptation is to reduce the net cost of 
  climate change and sea-level rise, whether those costs apply to an economic 
  sector, an ecosystem, or a country. A simple schematic of the objective of adaptation 
  appears in <a href="#fig6-1">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>
<p>Adaptation within natural systems has been considered a possibility only recently; 
  it results in part from considerations of coastal resilience. An example is 
  provided by coral reefs. Applying the two types of adaptation discussed in <a href="297.htm#box6-5">Box 
  6-5</a>, Pittock (1999) suggests that "autonomous adaptation" is what reefs 
  would do by themselves, whereas "planned adaptation" involves conscious human 
  interference to assist in the persistence of some desirable characteristics 
  of the coral reef system. The first type of adaptation may involve more rapid 
  growth of coral, changes in species composition, or evolution of particular 
  species in response to changed temperatures or other conditions. Planned adaptation 
  might involve "seeding" of particular reefs with species adapted to higher temperatures 
  or attempts to limit increased sediment, pollutant, or freshwater flow onto 
  reefs. For reef communities that presently are under stress and are likely to 
  be particularly vulnerable to climate change, the design of managed (or planned) 
  adaptation should involve an evaluation of the extent of autonomous adaptation 
  that can be expected given the current and probable future status of the reef 
  system.</p>
<p>Some adaptation measures handle uncertainty better than others. For example, 
  beach nourishment can be implemented as relative sea level rises and therefore 
  is more flexible than a dike or seawall; expansion of the latter may require 
  removal or addition of structures. Any move from "hard" (e.g., seawall) 
  to "soft" (e.g., beach nourishment) shore protection measures must 
  be accompanied, however, by a much better understanding of coastal processes 
  that prevail in the area (Leafe <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Rolling easements are 
  more robust than setbacks (Titus, 1998) but may be impractical for market or 
  cultural reasons. Maddrell (1996) found that over time scales of 35 and 100 
  years, managed coastal retreat is the most cost-effective adaptation option 
  in reducing flood risks and protection costs for nuclear power facilities on 
  the shingle foreland at Dungeness, UK. Flood insurance can discourage a flexible 
  response if rates are kept artificially low or fixed at the time of initial 
  construction, as they are in the United States (Crowell <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Reevaluations of the efficacy of hard shore protection schemes as a long-term 
  response to climate change and sea-level rise are increasingly being undertaken. 
  Chao and Hobbs (1997) have considered the role of decision analysis of shore 
  protection under climate change uncertainty; Pope (1997) has suggested several 
  ways of responding to coastal erosion and flooding that have relevance in the 
  context of climate change. Documented changes in tidal characteristics as a 
  result of the construction of sea dikes and seawalls also have implications 
  for shore protection in the face of rising sea level. Several alternatives to 
  seawalls have been suggested as adaptation measures to reduce coastal erosion 
  and saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels in Shanghai, including improving 
  drainage quality and channel capacity, increasing pumping facilities to reduce 
  the water table, constructing a barrier across the mouth of the river, and developing 
  new crops that are tolerant of a higher groundwater table (Chen and Zong, 1999).</p>
<p>It also should be noted, however, that Doornkamp (1998) has argued that in 
  some situations past management decisions about human activities in the coastal 
  zone (including flood defenses, occupance of flood-prone lands, extraction of 
  groundwater and natural gas) have had an impact on relative land and sea levels 
  and have done more to increase the risk of coastal flooding than damage that 
  can be assigned to global warming to date.</p>
