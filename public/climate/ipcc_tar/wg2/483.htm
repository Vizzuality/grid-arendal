<h3>12.7.5. Design of Human Environments</h3>
<p>Several measures can be taken to better design human environments to cope with 
  potential health stresses resulting from climate change. These measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Air conditioning and other measures to reduce exposure to heat<br>
  <li>Limiting exposure to disease vectors by measures such as use of screens 
  on doors and windows and restriction of vector habitats (especially near waterways 
  and urban wetlands)<br>
  <li>Land-use planning to minimize ecological factors that increase vulnerability 
  to potential climate changes, such as deforestation, which increases runoff 
  and the risk of flood-related injury and contamination of water supplies; animal 
  stock pressures on water catchments; and settlement of marginal or hazardous 
  areas such as semi-tropical coastal areas that are prone to storms and close 
  to good vector breeding sites.</ul>

<h3>12.7.6. Vulnerable Populations, including Indigenous and 
  Poor</h3>
<p>Woodward <i>et al.</i> (1998) have argued that the effects of climate change on health 
  will be most severe in populations that already are marginal. For these populations, 
  climate change and sea-level rise impacts will be one more cause for "overload." 
  In general, indigenous people in Australia and New Zealand are vulnerable to 
  the effects of climate change because they tend to be excluded from mainstream 
  economic activity and modern technological education and experience higher levels 
  of poverty, lower rates of employment, and higher rates of incarceration than 
  the overall population. These factors have widespread and long-term impacts 
  on health (Braaf, 1999).</p>
<p>For example, Northern Territory health data for 1992-1994 show that the 
  mortality rate for indigenous people was 3.5-4 times greater than that 
  for nonindigenous people. Life expectation at birth was 14-20 years lower 
  for indigenous Australians than for nonindigenous Australians (Anderson <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). The indigenous population displays diseases and health problems that 
  are typical of developed and developing nations. This includes high rates of 
  circulatory diseases, obesity, and diabetes, as well as diarrheal diseases and 
  meningococcal infections. High rates of chronic and infectious diseases affect 
  individual and community well-being and reduce resilience to new health risks 
  (Braaf, 1999).</p>
<p>A changing climate has implications for vector-borne and waterborne diseases 
  in indigenous communities. In the "Top End" of the Northern Territory 
  during the wet season, hot and humid conditions are conducive for vectors of 
  infectious diseases endemic in the region. Vectors include flies, ticks, cockroaches, 
  mites, and mosquitoes. Flies can spread scabies and other diseases. Mosquitoes 
  are vectors for Australian encephalitis and endemic polyarthritis. Giardia and 
  shigella are water-borne diseases that are common among indigenous children 
  in the region. Both can be spread from infected people to others through consumption 
  of infected food and untreated water. Existing and worsening overcrowded housing 
  conditions, poor sanitation, and poor housing materials create breeding grounds 
  for infection. Climate changes and sea-level rise&#151;which create conditions 
  that are suitable for new vectors (such as malaria) or expand distributions 
  of existing vectors&#151;may expose such vulnerable populations to increased 
  risks.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the gap between the health of indigenous people and the remainder 
  of the population is less marked than in Australia but is substantial nevertheless. 
  In 1996, life expectancy at birth was 8.1 years less for Maori females than 
  for non-Maori females and 9.0 years less for Maori males than for non-Maori 
  males (Statistics New Zealand, 1998a). As in Australia, this difference is associated 
  with and partly caused by poorer economic circumstances and lack of appropriate, 
  effective services (Durie, 1994). Consequently, Maori are at greater risk of 
  health problems related to climate variability and climate change. An example 
  is the lack of reticulated water supplies in the East Cape of the North Island, 
  an area in which the population is predominantly Maori and in many cases cannot 
  afford to truck in water in times of drought.</p>
<p>Impact assessments that consider only biophysical relationships between climate 
  and health will be inadequate in evaluating indigenous health outcomes. The 
  possibility&#151;or, indeed, likelihood&#151;that people may have very different 
  views concerning what makes them vulnerable to climate change, which impacts 
  may be significant, and what responses may be implemented also will need to 
  be considered (Braaf, 1999).</p>
<p>The present social circumstances of indigenous peoples provide a poor basis 
  on which to build adaptation responses to climate change threats. Thus, policies 
  that aim to improve resilience to climate change impacts could encompass efforts 
  to reduce relevant social liabilities&#151;poverty, poor education, unemployment, 
  and incarceration&#151;and support mechanisms that maintain cultural integrity. 
  Adaptive strategies could pursue economic development of these communities while 
  sustaining the environments on which these populations are dependent (Howitt, 
  1993).</p>
<p>In other parts of the Pacific, there are many countries that are particularly 
  susceptible to the effects of climate change&#151;especially low-lying island 
  states, which are likely to be severely affected by sea-level rise and increases 
  in storm activity. Australia and New Zealand have close relations with many 
  of the Pacific island states. For example, New Zealand has particular responsibilities 
  for Niue, the Cook Islands, and Tokelau and contains substantial expatriate 
  communities from most of the islands. Climate-related threats to these islands 
  (see <a href="619.htm">Chapter 17</a>) would impact immediately on Australia 
  and New Zealand. </p>
