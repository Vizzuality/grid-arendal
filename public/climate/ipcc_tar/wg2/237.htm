<h4>5.5.3.2.4. Woody species, grass, and weeds mix </h4>
<p>There have been some suggestions that woody weed encroachment into herbaceous 
  parts of rangeland (up to three-fold in some cases) may be a result of changes 
  in regional climate (Brown et al., 1997b) and may be facilitated by the increase 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration since industrialization (Polley et al.,1996). 
  However, the more plausible explanation for the present observed increase in 
  woody weeds in many rangelands is that it is a result of land-use change (especially 
  increased grazing and changes in fire regime) as well as land degradation (Bond 
  et al., 1994; Archer et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1997b; Gill and Burke 1999). 
  A modeling study of semi-arid woodlands in Australia under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and 
  climate change suggests that future potential burning opportunities may increase 
  as a result of the CO<sub>2</sub> response of the grass layer, which allows adequate fuel 
  to build up more frequently, provided stocking rates are not increased commensurately 
  (Howden et al., 1999c). Thus, regional climate change and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, as concluded 
  in the SAR, may change the balance from more herbaceous species (grasses and 
  herbs) to more woody species (mainly shrubs), subsequently affecting productivity, 
  decomposition, and fire frequency of the system, as well as forage quality (Allen-Diaz, 
  1996; Noble and Gitay, 1996) and regional carbon cycling (Gill and Burke, 1999).</p>
<h4><a name="53325"></a>5.3.3.2.5. Changes in phenology</h4>
<p>Increased variability of rainfall and temperature is likely to affect the phenology 
  of plant and animal species (Gitay and Noble, 1998). It also would affect animal 
  abundance and feeding behavior (see <a href="218.htm">Section 5.4</a>) and would 
  be critical for some pests and diseases and availability of forage for livestock 
  and other mammals (Watt et al., 1995). Species composition changes also could 
  occur. Brown and Carter (1998) manipulated the climate of small areas of temperate 
  grasslands and found that weeds become established in gaps created through increased 
  occurrence of spring or summer drought. Warmer winters induce a late spring 
  drought&#151;which, when combined with an imposed summer drought&#151;leads 
  to significant reduction in cover of nonweeds especially and an increase in 
  weedy species. However, if summer moisture is increased, grasses become dominant. 
  Thus, if climate change results in changes in summer and winter soil moisture 
  and land use creates gaps, this is likely to affect species composition in some 
  grasslands. Fuller and Prince (1996)&#151;using satellite data and NDVI to detect 
  vegetation change&#151;found that there is an early greening of the Miombo woodlands. 
  These woodlands are sensitive to the arrival of spring rains, thus might undergo 
  changes if there is a shift in rainfall patterns. </p>
