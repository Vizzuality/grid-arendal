<h3><a name="1522"></a>15.2.2. Natural Resources</h3>
<p>In this section, impacts studies on forests, grasslands, and protected areas 
  are reviewed. Protected areas include mountains, wetlands, and coastal/marine 
  areas.</p>
<h4><a name="15221"></a>15.2.2.1. Forests</h4>
<p>We must consider two types of climate change effects on forests:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in the functions of existing forests relating to productivity, nutrient 
    cycling, water quality, ecosystem carbon storage, trace gas fluxes, and biodiversity</li>
  <li>Changes in composition as forests regenerate under altered conditions. Fundamental 
    changes in forest ecosystem structure can lead to very dramatic changes in 
    functions. Climate change effects on catastrophic events (e.g., fire, insect 
    outbreaks, pathogens, storms) that have marked effects on ecosystem structure 
    are particularly important to consider. </li>
</ul>
<p>A general discussion of forest response to climate change appears in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>.</p>
<p>North America contains about 17% of the world's forests (Brooks, 1993), 
  and these forests contain about 14-17% of the world's terrestrial 
  biospheric carbon (Heath <i>et al</i>., 1993). Key climate change issues related to 
  forests in North America include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in the geographic range of different forest types</li>
  <li>Increases in the frequency of fire and insect outbreaks</li>
  <li>Changes in the carbon storage function of forests (i.e., from sinks to sources)</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the importance of multiple stresses (ozone, nitrogen deposition, 
    land-use change) that work in concert with climate change</li>
  <li>Changes in human interactions with forests (e.g., risk to settlements, recreational 
    use)</li>
  <li>Concern for the boreal forests of Canada because of their large extent, 
    carbon reserves, and commercial value, combined with the fact that climate 
    change is expected to be most severe at high latitudes</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="152211"></a>15.2.2.1.1. Changes in function of existing forests</h4>
<p>There is strong evidence that there has been significant warming at high latitudes 
  (Jacoby <i>et al</i>., 1996) and that this warming has increased boreal forest productivity 
  (Ciais <i>et al</i>., 1995; Myneni <i>et al</i>., 1997). However, carbon balance is not necessarily 
  changed by increases in productivity. Net ecosystem carbon flux (or carbon storage) 
  is a product of changes in ecosystem production and decomposition. Keyser <i>et al</i>. (2000) used long-term meteorological records to drive the BIOME-BGC model 
  to evaluate changes in the carbon balance of North American high-latitude forests. 
  They conclude that increases in net primary production and decomposition were 
  roughly balanced and that net ecosystem production (i.e., total carbon storage) 
  was not likely to shift significantly with climate change. In contrast, Goulden 
  <i>et al</i>. (1998) and Lindroth <i>et al</i>. (1998) found that boreal forests could become 
  net CO<sub>2</sub> sources. The key uncertainties in this area are the effects 
  of permafrost melting on release of previously frozen carbon, the ability of 
  more productive ecosystem types (aspen, white spruce) to expand in extent, and 
  the importance of soil moisture. Evaluating changes in carbon balance in northern 
  forests should be a priority topic for research. <br>
</p>
<p> There is consensus emerging that at mid-latitudes, site-specific conditions 
  as well as history, human management, air pollution, and biotic effects (e.g., 
  herbivory) are much stronger controllers of forest productivity, decomposition, 
  and carbon balance than climate change or CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (Eamus and 
  Jarvis, 1989; Aber and Driscoll, 1997; Ollinger <i>et al</i>., 1997; Goodale <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Stohlgren <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p> There is general agreement that excess nitrogen deposition, which is most 
  pronounced in the mid-latitudes, has increased carbon storage in mid-latitude 
  forests by facilitating increases in production in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (Townsend <i>et al</i>., 1996). The ability of forests to continue to absorb excess 
  nitrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> is not at all certain, however (Norby, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  Evidence for climate change effects on forest ecosystem "services" 
  (i.e., functions that are important to productivity, environmental quality, 
  and other human concerns) are beginning to emerge in North America. Murdoch 
  <i>et al</i>. (1998) suggest that climate warming increases soil acidification and 
  stream nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations, especially in forests 
  with a history of high nitrogen deposition. Extreme climate events (e.g., soil 
  freezing, which may increase as a result of warming-induced decreases in snow 
  cover) also appear to lead to increases in soil and stream acidification and 
  NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels (Mitchell <i>et al</i>., 1996; Groffman <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  Evaluations of climate change effects on fluxes of trace gases other than CO<sub>2</sub> 
  [methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)] have been inconclusive 
  (Prather <i>et al</i>., 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change effects on biogeochemical processes are likely to be small relative 
  to site characteristics, land-use history, and atmospheric chemistry, especially 
  in mid-latitudes (Aber and Driscoll, 1997).</p>
