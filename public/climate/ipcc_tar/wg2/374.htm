<h2>9.14. Cross-Cutting Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="9141"></a>9.14.1 Costing the Health Impacts of Climate Change </h3>
<p>Costing the health impacts of climate change is complex and controversial. 
  It is complex because of the great heterogeneity of the health impacts, which 
  include death, infectious disease, nutritional deprivation, and post-traumatic 
  stress disorders. It is controversial because of difficulties in assigning money 
  values to a diverse range of health deficits, doing so across varied cultures 
  and economies, and taking account of the full "stream" of health impacts 
  into the future (with appropriate time-discounting). During the 1990s, an attempt 
  was made to develop a more standardized approach to measurement of the population 
  health deficit by combining chronic illness or disability and premature death, 
  via weighting procedures, into an integrated index&#151;the Disability-Adjusted 
  Life Year (Murray, 1994; Murray and Lopez, 1996). </p>
<p>To date, however, there is negligible scientific literature on the population 
  burden of disease attributable to current or future climate change. There is 
  no such literature on the DALY-based impact. Hence, there is no basis for making 
  overall estimates of the direct costs to society of the health impacts of climate 
  change. Nevertheless, some approximate estimations have been published of the 
  impacts on national economies of major infectious disease outbreaks, such as 
  might occur more often under conditions of climate change. For example, the 
  outbreak of plague-like disease in Surat, northwest India, in 1994 cost an estimated 
  US$3 billion in lost revenues to India alone (John, 1996; WHO, 1997). The cost 
  of the 1994 Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) epidemic in Thailand was estimated 
  to be US$19-51 million (Sornmani, <i>et al</i>., 1995). The cost of the 
  1994 epidemic of dengue/ DHF in Puerto Rico was estimated to be US$12 million 
  for direct hospitalization costs alone (Rodriguez, 1997; Meltzer <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). </p>
<h3><a name="9142"></a>9.14.2 Development, Sustainability, and Equity </h3>
<p>The ideas of development, sustainability, and equity inform much of the content 
  of this chapter. It has been noted repeatedly that health impacts will tend 
  to occur unevenly in the world and that the impacts in poorer populations, especially 
  in the least-developed countries, often will be augmented by the heightened 
  vulnerability of those populations. That is one of several reasons why&#151;in 
  today's world in which the gap between rich and poor is widening (UNDP 
  1999), in association with the nonredistributive character of market-dominated 
  global economics (McMichael and Beaglehole, 2000)&#151;new ways of redressing 
  the imbalance in wealth and knowledge should be found. </p>
<p>The chapter also notes that development on a broad front&#151;social, economic, 
  technological, and provision of public health services and capacities&#151;is 
  crucial to a population's adaptive capacity to lessen the impacts of climate 
  change.</p>
<p>Indeed, the health of a population is a key indicator of "sustainability." 
  The capacity of the global population to achieve and maintain good health is 
  an index of how well the natural and social environments are being managed. 
  Wealthy local populations can afford to subsidize their health maintenance, 
  drawing on resources imported from elsewhere. At a global level, however, health 
  indicators provide a more valid indication of the extent to which the "carrying 
  capacity" of the biosphere is being maintained.</p>
