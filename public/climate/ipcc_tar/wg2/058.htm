<h3>1.2.2. Human-Environment Systems: Implications for Development, Equity, and 
  Sustainability </h3>
<p>The TAR attempts to place the issue of climate change more centrally within 
  the evolving socioeconomic context. This context is critical to evaluation of 
  the vulnerability of sectors or regions to climatic changes and thus must be 
  borne in mind by anyone who attempts such assessments, as well as policymakers 
  who will need to consider the wide range of implications of technological or 
  organizational choices on the resilience of natural and social systems to climatic 
  changes. </p>
<p>Development of social institutions and technological innovations over the past 
  10,000 years (the era of civilization after the glacial age when ice largely 
  disappeared) has led to rapid advancement in material well-being but also, very 
  importantly, population growth and resource pressures (e.g., Cohen, 1995; Meyer, 
  1996). This development process has accelerated and become much larger in scale 
  in recent decades. Globally, growth in annual per capita income has been estimated 
  to have risen from about 0.6% in the 19th-century period of industrial expansion 
  to more than 2% yr<sup>-1</sup> in the post-World War II era of high technological innovation 
  and global economic cooperation (Cooper, 2000). Some analysts attribute this 
  boom to the combination of stabilization of national economies by governmental 
  management and liberalization of trade allowed by international organizations. 
  Indeed, in this vision-which has been labeled the "cornucopian world view" (Ehrlich 
  and Ehrlich, 1996)-a competitive system that fosters and rewards innovation 
  has led to a prolonged period of development and growth that will increasingly 
  embrace currently less-developed nations as well. Furthermore, according to 
  Kates (1996), it is possible to achieve a world without famine, with little 
  seasonal or chronic undernutrition and virtually no nutrient deficiencies or 
  nutrition-related illnesses. In the area of energy and natural resources, according 
  to von Weizsäcker et al. (1998), it is possible to increase resource productivity 
  by a factor of four: The world would then enjoy twice the wealth that is currently 
  available, simultaneously halving the stress placed on our natural environment. 
</p>
<p>However, this level of development continues to be an elusive goal for a large 
  fraction of the world's population. There is a noticeable disparity between 
  the levels of development that have been achieved in various societies. These 
  differences are obscured by globally averaged income growth data such as those 
  reported by Cooper (2000). For example, gaps between the rich and the poor are 
  widening between developed and developing countries and within tropical African, 
  Asian, and Latin American countries (UNDP, 1999). Although there have been notable 
  successes, many countries in these regions have experienced increases in economic 
  instability, social insecurity, environmental degradation, and endemic poverty. 
  Despite spectacular gains in the means of development-such as advances in science, 
  technology, and medicine during the past century-development planning at national 
  and global levels has not always alleviated poverty and inequity (see <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 
  1-2</a>; Munasinghe, 2000).</p>
<p>Global food security clearly has improved in recent years as the focus of famine 
  has shifted from large, heavily populated countries to sparsely populated and 
  small nations, but the number of people at risk of hunger still is very high, 
  even in parts of heavily populated nations. Chen and Kates (1996) estimate that 
  the population at risk of outright starvation could be as high as 35 million; 
  FAO (1999) estimates that about 800 million people in developing countries and 
  34 million people in developed countries suffer from undernourishment. Achieving 
  global food security is complicated by growth in human population and political 
  instability that disrupts food delivery systems. Projections vary widely, ranging 
  from stabilization of population at near-present levels sometime in the 21st 
  century to a greater than three-fold increase by the end of the century (e.g., 
  Fischer et al., 1996; Lutz, 1996; IPCC, 2000). At current population growth 
  rates, world food production must double within the next 40 years to feed this 
  population; such a doubling of food production may require expansion of agricultural 
  land into forests and areas that presently are considered marginal for agriculture 
  (but not necessarily marginal in other respects). On the other hand, some authors 
  (e.g., Waggoner et al., 1996) have argued it is possible to increase the dietary 
  standard of all humans up to a doubling of current populations and at the same 
  time to "spare land for nature" (Ausubel, 1996). This expansive vision follows 
  from the belief that resources can be made available for the extension of current 
  intensive agricultural practices to currently low-technology regions. The extent 
  to which such practices can be extended is debated, on social and environmental 
  grounds, by those who hold an opposing worldview, which has been called "limits 
  to growth" (e.g., Ehrlich et al., 1995). Moreover, even if such agricultural 
  intensification were to occur, there is no guarantee that extensive land use 
  for economic development activities other than growing food would not simultaneously 
  occur. Thus, the hope of "sparing land for nature" via intensification likewise 
  is a controversial vision. </p>
<p>The need to improve productivity per unit area has led to more intensive methods 
  in developing countries-which, together with low or negative economic support 
  for agricultural products, often has driven smallholders off their land and 
  led to emigration to urban centers (WCED, 1987). The influx of poor, unskilled, 
  and often unemployable people has led to explosive and difficult-to-manage growth 
  in these centers (O'Meara, 1999). This sets the stage for the gestation of a 
  new set of environmental problems, including substandard housing, squatter settlements, 
  solid waste buildups, unsatisfactory sewage disposal, urban floods, and urban 
  water pollution, as well as the characteristic problems of large cities such 
  as crime and social insecurity. </p>
<p>In opposition to the aforementioned expansive visions, others (e.g., Daily, 
  1997) express concern that services provided by ecosystems to society may be 
  undermined by a combination of unsustainable population growth, destruction 
  of natural habitats, and pollution of air, soils, and waters. Three decades 
  ago, debate raged about whether indefinite economic expansion would be limited 
  by environmental and other resource constraints. Meadows et al. (1972) postulated 
  in a controversial work that environmental protection and economic growth are 
  not compatible; there are "limits to growth." For those holding this worldview, 
  current development patterns will not allow continued improvement of the human 
  condition for much longer; instead, such development will ensure continuing 
  degradation of natural assets such as biodiversity (e.g., Pimm, 1991). Thus, 
  it is feared that the environment may be losing part of its capacity to support 
  life and therefore may be imposing another set of constraints on the development 
  process-disturbances to air, waters, soils, and species distributions brought 
  about by human activities-that will require responses to reduce additional risks. 
  Several sharp critiques appeared (e.g., Cole et al., 1973), noting that the 
  "limits" paradigm ignored enhanced productivity brought about by innovation 
  and that although limits eventually might become a problem, increased knowledge 
  generated by economic expansion could create substitutes for resources that 
  were being used nonrenewably, and much less energy and materials would be needed 
  to produce economic growth as technology blossomed (e.g., Grossman and Krueger, 
  1995; but see Myers and Simon, 1994). Moreover, it has been argued that enhanced 
  wealth and knowledge also can reduce vulnerability to environmental stresses 
  such as climatic change. </p>
<p>Subsequently, a modified view that considered both the "cornucopian" and "limits" 
  paradigms emerged: the strategy of sustainable development. It is designed to 
  promote conservation of resources and protection of the environment while sustaining 
  a healthy society whose needs are securely provided. In response to requests 
  from governments participating in the IPCC process, the TAR is attentive to 
  the concept of sustainable development. </p>
<p>Technology and organization clearly have reduced the vulnerability of humans 
  in some countries to a variety of hazards. In the context of the IPCC process, 
  this would include, for example, flood control engineering projects that have 
  reduced lives lost in catastrophic flooding. However, pioneering analyses in 
  the natural hazards literature (e.g., Burton et al., 1993) note that large-scale 
  dependence of massive populations on the functioning of giant engineering projects 
  or social institutions often has simply transformed our risks from the predevelopment 
  state of high-frequency, low-amplitude risk (many localized threats to small 
  numbers of people in each instance) to the present state of low-frequency, high-amplitude 
  vulnerability (where a rare levee failure or the simultaneous occurrence of 
  drought in several major exporting granaries poses the risk of infrequent but 
  very catastrophic losses). Moreover, the consequences of these risks are unlikely 
  to be equitably distributed within and across income groups and nations, which 
  requires assessment of the distributional implications of developmental risks 
  and benefits (e.g., <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a>). In many developing 
  regions, population pressures and poverty have led to occupation of hazardous 
  lands (e.g., steep slopes, valley bottoms) and has greatly increased vulnerability 
  to climate extremes. Of course, many factors other than those mentioned above 
  can contribute to vulnerability (e.g., Etkin, 1999). </p>
<p>In addition to this huge list of challenges, potential threats to the global 
  environment are connected to the development process. The TAR identifies scientific 
  and policy linkages among key global environmental issues, one of which is climate 
  change. Other global environmental issues include loss of biological diversity, 
  stratospheric ozone depletion, marine environment and resource degradation, 
  and persistent organic pollutants (Watson et al., 1998). Other contemporary 
  issues are evident in many places across the globe-though each instance is not 
  global in scale (e.g., Turner et al., 1990)-such as freshwater degradation, 
  desertification, land degradation, deforestation, and unsustainable use of forest 
  resources. None of these threats implies that the net effects of human developments 
  are necessarily negative, only that embedded in many development activities 
  are a host of negative aspects that many analysts and policymakers believe must 
  be considered in development planning. Strategies to modify the amount and/or 
  kinds of development activities to account for these threats are considered 
  more comprehensively in <a href="../wg3/index.htm">the report of Working Group III</a>. 
  The TAR also focuses on linkages between climate change on one hand and local 
  and regional environmental issues-for example, urban air pollution and regional 
  acid deposition-on the other. (Strategies to deal with these issues that also 
  help with adaptive or mitigative capacity for climate change often are called 
  co-benefits.) Among the new areas of emphasis in the TAR are linkages between 
  global environmental issues and the challenges of meeting key human needs such 
  as adequate food, clean water, clean air, and adequate and affordable energy 
  services. </p>
