<h4>7.2.2.3. Urban Settlements </h4>
<p>Urban settlements feature many of the same impacts of climate change as other 
  settlements-such as air and water pollution, flooding, or consequences of increasingly 
  viable disease vectors. These impacts may take unusual or extremely costly forms 
  in urban areas-for example, flooding that results not from river flooding but 
  from overwhelmed urban storm drains and sewers during extreme rainfall events 
  (which may become more common in the future). Urban settlements also experience 
  the consequences of accommodating migrant populations, the unique aspects of 
  urban heat islands (which affect human health and energy demand), and some of 
  the more severe aspects of air and water pollution. To some extent, the effects 
  of climate change anywhere in the world are integrated through world markets, 
  social and political changes, and migration. Many of these social and economic 
  effects appear in the world's cities, including some of the world's largest 
  (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2000). </p>
<h4> <a name="72231"></a>7.2.2.3.1. Migration </h4>
<p>The SAR discussed at some length the potential impact of population movement 
  in response to environmental impact and attractions of large urban areas. Human 
  populations show significant tendencies to adapt to interannual variability 
  of climate via migration, although migration may be the last of a complex set 
  of coping strategies (Meze-Hausken, 2000). For example, decreases in crop and 
  rice yields as a result of a prolonged dry season under ENSO conditions in Indonesia 
  causes farmers to leave the villages to work in the surrounding cities. Population 
  subsequently recovers (Yoshino, 1996b; Yoshino et al., 1997). In some cases, 
  immigration is more permanent and does not involve large urban areas. For example, 
  after three successive typhoons hit Tau Island in American Samoa in 1987, 1990, 
  and 1991, about one-third of the population abandoned their homes and moved 
  to Pago Pago on Tutuila Island, putting more population pressure on the limited 
  economic opportunities and services of that island (Meehl, 1996). </p>
<p>A school of thought based on observations of several ethnic conflicts in the 
  developing world suggests that environmental degradation, loss of access to 
  resources, and resulting human migration (including "environmental refugees") 
  in some circumstances could become a source of political and even military conflict 
  (see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="411.htm">11</a>). The result 
  is possible, but the many intervening and contributory causes of intergroup 
  and intragroup conflicts allow only low confidence in predictions of increases 
  in such conflicts as a result of climate change, even where environmental resources 
  are scarce and threatened (e.g., Wolf, 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="72232"></a>7.2.2.3.2. Human health </h4>
<p>The impact of climate change on human heath in settlements is a complicated 
  mechanism that involves the interaction of physical attributes of settlements 
  and precursors for direct effects of heat stress, vector-borne diseases such 
  as malaria, and enteric diseases such as cholera (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>). These impacts are common to all types of settlements, including traditional 
  ones. The 1997-98 El Niño event provided a way to derive and test process models 
  for the impacts of climate change. In Latin America, for example, outbreaks 
  of malaria and Dengue fever appeared to be related to anomalously high nighttime 
  minimum temperatures (Epstein et al., 1998). Settlements provide disease vectors 
  and organisms with habitat in the form of standing water, garbage dumps, and 
  space sheltered from the elements. Flooding can flush organisms into settlements' 
  clean water supplies, causing disease outbreaks. Heavy rainfall in normally 
  dry areas leads to rapid increases in rodent populations, in turn leading to 
  increases in rodent-borne diseases such as hantavirus (Glass et al., 2000). 
  Cholera-harboring marine plankton blooms also can be triggered by riverine flooding, 
  which provides extra nutrients to the coastal environment (Colwell, 1996). Extremely 
  dry conditions reduce the quantities and quality of water available for sanitary 
  and drinking purposes, which also can trigger cholera and diarrheal outbreaks. 
  Historically, this has been a problem on various Pacific islands during drought. 
  Poverty, crowding, and poor sanitation in settlements add to these problems, 
  as reported in the SAR. </p>
<h4><a name="72233"></a>7.2.2.3.3. Heat islands and human health </h4>
<p>Warming of urban air increases in intensity and area as cities grow (Oke, 1982). 
  This growing "heat island" tends to aggravate the risk of more frequent heat 
  waves, as well as their impacts. Research indicates that variability in summer 
  nighttime minimum temperature (temperatures above 32ºC at night)-combined with 
  lack of acclimatization, high humidity, and poorly ventilated and insulated 
  housing stock-may be the most important factor in urban heat deaths (Chestnut 
  et al., 1998). Elderly people, the very young, people in ill health, and poor 
  people are most likely to be affected (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a> for 
  these and other health effects). Because climate change is expected to raise 
  nighttime minimum temperatures more than daytime highs, urban heat islands would 
  be a significant health concern in the largest human settlements. </p>
<p>Conversely, during the rainy season (except in a few cities, such as Cairo, 
  where practically no rain occurs) the heat island enhances the intensity and 
  frequency of rain showers (Changnon, 1992; Jáuregui and Romales, 1996), leading 
  to higher risk of street flooding or mudslides where the urban poor live. Moreover, 
  warmer and drier climates may aggravate air pollution seasonally because of 
  wind erosion of bare soil areas in cities with semi-arid or arid climates (e.g., 
  Mexico City, Beijing, Delhi, and cities located in sub-Saharan Africa). Blowing 
  dust and high summer temperatures are likely to increase the incidence of heat 
  stroke, respiratory illness, and transmission of disease by deposition of airborne 
  bacteria in lungs and on food. </p>
<p>In warmer and drier climates, local minimum temperatures tend to be higher, 
  which tends to attenuate the intensity (and depth) of temperature inversions 
  formed by nocturnal radiation cooling and reduce the risk of poor air quality. 
  However-and especially in large cities located in valleys (e.g., Mexico City, 
  Santiago, Beijing, Delhi)-this attenuation effect could be compensated by a 
  higher rate of radiation cooling to an air layer with less moisture content, 
  aggravating the air pollution situation. Elevated subsidence inversions such 
  as those on the descending branch of semi-permanent anticyclones and limiting 
  vertical dispersion of pollutants in cities such as Saõ Paulo, Los Angeles, 
  or Tijuana are less likely to significantly change their thermal structure in 
  a warmer world. </p>
<h4><a name="72234"></a>7.2.2.3.4. Water pollution </h4>
<p>Despite massive investment in water treatment in the developed world and increasingly 
  in the developing world over the past century, many settlements throughout the 
  world (especially in rural areas) still are without adequate water treatment 
  (UNCHS, 1999). In the case of drought, reduced water availability could force 
  people to use polluted water sources in settlements at the same time that reduced 
  flow rates reduce the rate of dilution of water contaminants. In the opposite 
  case, flooding frequently damages water treatment works and floods wells, pit 
  latrines and septic tanks, and agricultural and waste disposal areas and sometimes 
  simply overwhelms treatment systems, contaminating water supplies. </p>
<h4> <a name="72235"></a>7.2.2.3.5. Air pollution </h4>
<p>Air pollution is a serious problem in many cities of the world, even under 
  the current climate. The following issues emerge from a review of developing 
  country cities that are members of the 69 urban agglomerations with population 
  of more than 3 million in 1990 (UNEP, 1992): </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Population trends have not yet stabilized, which means cities will continue 
    to extend their urban area (and urban heat island). 
  <li>Motor vehicles now constitute the main source of pollutants in most cities 
    of the industrialized world. Although the rate of growth in the number of 
    vehicles in some settlements in the developing world has been very rapid (Simon, 
    1996), cities in developing countries (with exceptions) exhibit greater variety 
    in air pollution sources. This depends on the level of motorization and the 
    level, density, and type of industry present. Cities in Latin America, for 
    example, tend to have high vehicle densities and high vehicle-to-total pollution 
    loads. The major sources of air pollution in Delhi are 2.8 million vehicles, 
    thermal power plants, industries, and domestic fuel combustion. The problem 
    has been compounded by unplanned development, inadequate public transport, 
    poor road conditions, lack of traffic management, inadequate vehicle/engine 
    maintenance, use of old vehicles, and poor fuel quality. Many developing countries' 
    vehicle fleets tend to be older and poorly maintained (and not easily replaced 
    because of the low incomes of their owners)-a factor that will increase the 
    significance of motor vehicles as a pollution source (UNEP, 1992).
  <li>Cities with seasonally warm, calm air and sunny weather with high traffic 
    densities tend to be especially prone to the net formation of ozone and other 
    photochemical oxidants, although it is not yet clear whether such conditions 
    will be more or less prevalent under climate change. Volatile organic carbons 
    (VOCs) from biogenic and anthropogenic sources such as automobiles increase 
    at high temperatures, and thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) 
    also increases (Samson et al., 1989).
  <li>Atmospheric and air-shed modeling exercises suggest that higher temperatures 
    and more stable air episodes under global warming of 4ºC could lead to 1-20% 
    increases in peak urban ozone concentrations in the United States (Morris 
    et al., 1989; Penner et al., 1989) and increased violation of clean air standards 
    (Morris et al., 1995). See <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a> for the health 
    effects of elevated ozone levels.

      <p align="center"><b>Box 7-2. Air Pollution Problems of Large Cities in 
        the Developing World-Update on the Case of Mexico City </b></p>
      <p>The SAR notes the complex air pollution problems of Mexico City and expresses 
        concern that increases in air stability episodes under climate change 
        could exacerbate an already difficult situation. Although these problems 
        remain severe, as noted below, Mexico City also shows that adaptation 
        (mitigation of air pollution) is possible and effective. </p>
      <p>Mexico City is located in an elevated inland valley (approximately 2,250 
        m above sea level) in central Mexico. The climate is subhumid tropical, 
        tempered by the altitude. Industrial activity contributes 20% of the city's 
        air pollution; 3 million motor vehicles that consume 17.3 million liters 
        of gasoline and 5 million liters of diesel daily (in 1997) generate 75% 
        of the pollution (Office of the Environment Annual Report, 1997). Typical 
        anticyclonic weather prevailing during the dry season contributes to frequent 
        thermal inversions that prevent dispersion of pollutants. Moreover, abundant 
        insolation prevailing during the dry warm period (March to May) favors 
        activation of precursors [mainly oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and hydrocarbons 
        (HC)] to produce high levels of ozone. This also is the season for dust 
        storms and blowing dust (Jáuregui, 1989). Although transport may generate 
        75% of the airborne pollutants by weight, estimates made in 1989 regarding 
        transport's contribution to air pollution in terms of toxicity suggested 
        its contribution was 42.4%. A considerable contribution also comes from 
        vegetation and topsoil (12% of all airborne pollutants by weight in 1994) 
        (see Connolly, 1999). </p>
      <p>The Mexico City Ministry of the Environment subsequently found that ozone-one 
        of the most serious threats to health-was still above acceptable levels 
        on 300 days in 1999 but that some progress had been achieved. During the 
        worst days from 1990 to 1992, pollutants hit emergency levels on as many 
        as 177 days annually. Emergency levels occurred on 5 days in 1999. This 
        achievement was considered to be a result of anti-pollution efforts by 
        the local government. For example, in the early 1990s, lead was removed 
        from gasoline sold in the Valley of Mexico; laws restricted the use of 
        cars without catalytic converters to 4 weekdays; and inspections of factories 
        to reduce pollution doubled in 1999, to 152. The average ozone reading 
        fell from 197.6 to 144, where the air quality norm is 100 points of ozone-equivalent 
        to exposure to 0.11 ppm for 1 hour (Mexico City Ministry of the Environment, 
        2000). This progress in improving air quality suggests that even huge 
        developing world cities can begin to reduce pollution. </p>

  These measures also would help in the context of unfavorable atmospheric conditions
