<h4>5.8.2.2. Changes in Temperature </h4>
<p>Temperature is an important factor controlling many ecological and physical 
  functions of wetlands. Primary productivity and microbial activity are both 
  controlled to a certain extent by temperature conditions. Temperature also affects 
  evapotranspiration rates and has an impact on the water regime. Because higher 
  temperatures and drying of the surface soil usually occur together and interactively 
  affect the ecosystem processes, it is not always possible to separate their 
  impacts.</p>
<p>Although Gorham (1991) suggests that the effects of temperature will be overshadowed 
  by the impacts of water-level drawdown on northern peatlands, the impacts of 
  temperature increases on wetlands on permafrost may be drastic (Gorham, 1994a). 
  A fairly small increase in temperature might initiate large-scale melting of 
  permafrost, with thermokarst erosion and changed hydrological regimes as a consequence 
  (Billings, 1987). Work by Vitt et al. (1994) and Halsey et al. (1997) has demonstrated 
  clearly the dynamic association between the distribution of peatlands, peatland 
  types, and the presence or absence of permafrost in North America. This association 
  is strong enough that it has been used as a proxy method for inferring climatic 
  variability during the Holocene (Halsey et al., 1995). This might imply shifts 
  from black spruce/Sphagnum/lichen communities on permafrost to wetter fen communities, 
  with subsequent changes in carbon cycling.</p>
<h4><a name="5823"></a>5.8.2.3. Land-Use Change</h4>
<p>Land-use change may create multiple pressures on wetland habitats. Area estimates 
  of the scale of direct development of tropical peatlands vary and provide only 
  an imprecise picture of the current situation (Immirzi et al., 1992; Maltby 
  and Immirzi, 1996). In southeast Asia, agriculture and forestry are the major 
  peatland land uses. Toward the end of the 1980s, it was estimated that in Indonesia 
  alone 3.7 Mha (18% of the total peat swamp forest) had undergone some form of 
  development (Silvius et al., 1987). </p>
<p>Cultivation of tropical peatlands involves measures that radically change the 
  hydrological regime and consequently influence vegetation and soil processes. 
  Forests are cleared and effective drainage installed. In many places in southeast 
  Asia, cultivation of horticultural and estate crops has met with mixed success, 
  and some previously converted peatlands have been abandoned, although peat-forming 
  vegetation has failed to reestablish (Immirzi et al., 1992). Reasons for failure 
  include poor water management and persistent infertility of the soil (Rijksen 
  et al., 1997).</p>
<p>The total area of tropical peatland drained or otherwise altered during forestry 
  management is not known. Silvius et al. (1987) suggest that as much as 0.11 
  million km<sup>2</sup> of peatlands in Indonesia (i.e., as much as 50% of the 
  total resource) are possibly being exploited for forestry purposes. In Malaysia, 
  most of the remaining peat swamp forest outside limited conservation areas has 
  been logged (Immirzi et al., 1992). Sustainable-yield forestry is likely to 
  be the most appropriate form of land use for peat swamp forest, but such methods 
  applicable to peat swamps have yet to be developed, let alone implemented (Immirzi 
  et al., 1992).</p>
<p>Use of peatlands for forestry usually brings about smaller changes in the ecosystem. 
  In floodplain swamps and peatlands of the more continental areas of North America, 
  often only tree stands are managed (Dahl and Zoltai, 1997), but in northwestern 
  Europe and the southeastern United States, forestry use includes artificial 
  drainage (Richardson and McCarthy, 1994; P&auml;iv&auml;nen, 1997). Some 0.15 
  million km<sup>2</sup> have been drained for forestry, mostly in Scandinavia 
  and Russia (P&auml;iv&auml;nen, 1997). In these cases, much of the original 
  vegetation (Laine et al., 1995) and functions (Aust and Lea, 1991; Minkkinen 
  et al., 1999) are preserved during forestry management. About 70% of the expansive 
  peatlands in North Carolina (6,000 km2) have been entirely or partially degraded 
  through draining, ditching, or clearing (Richardson and Gibbons, 1993).</p>
<p>Peat harvesting for energy or horticultural use has the most drastic impact 
  on the ecosystem; vegetation is removed with the topsoil prior to harvesting, 
  and most of the accumulated peat gradually is extracted (Nyr&ouml;nen, 1996).</p>
