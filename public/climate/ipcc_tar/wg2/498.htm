<h4>13.2.1.2. Soils and Land Resources </h4>
<p>Climate change will impact directly and, through land-use change, indirectly 
  on a wide range of soil processes and properties that will determine the future 
  ability of land to fulfill key functions that are important for all terrestrial 
  ecosystems, as well as several socioeconomic activities, that underpin the well-being 
  of society. The following subsections summarize key effects. Further information 
  is summarized in the section on soils in the European ACACIA report (Rounsevell 
  and Imeson, 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="132121"></a>13.2.1.2.1. Soil physical properties </h4>
<p>Soil water contents respond rapidly to variability in the amounts and distribution 
  of precipitation or the addition of irrigation. Temperature changes affect soil 
  water by influencing evapotranspiration, and plant water use is further influenced 
  by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, leading to lower stomatal conductance 
  and increased leaf photosynthetic rates (Kirschbaum et al., 1996). Soil water 
  contents are highly variable in space (Rounsevell et al., 1999), so it is difficult 
  to generalize about specific climate impacts. </p>
<p>Climate change can be expected to modify soil structure through the physical 
  processes of shrink-swell (caused by wetting and drying) and freeze-thaw, as 
  well as through changes in soil organic matter (SOM) contents (Carter and Stewart, 
  1996). Compaction of soils results from inappropriate timing of tillage operations 
  during periods when the soil is too wet to be workable. Soil workability has 
  a strong influence on the distribution and management of arable crops in temperate 
  parts of Europe (Rounsevell, 1993; Rounsevell and Jones, 1993). Therefore, wet 
  areas with heavy soils could benefit from climate change (MacDonald et al., 
  1994; Rounsevell and Brignall, 1994). In a similar way, grassland systems can 
  suffer poaching by grazing livestock (i.e., damage caused by animal hooves) 
  (Harrod, 1979). Thus, drier soil conditions for longer periods of the year would 
  affect the distribution of intensive agricultural grassland in temperate Europe 
  (Rounsevell et al., 1996a) and may result in intensification of currently wet 
  upland grazing areas. </p>
<p>Soils with large clay contents shrink as they dry and swell when they become 
  wet again, forming large cracks and fissures. Drier climatic conditions will 
  increase the frequency and size of crack formation in soils, especially those 
  in temperate regions of Europe, which currently do not reach their full shrinkage 
  potential (Climate Change Impacts Review Group, 1991, 1996). Soils that shrink 
  and swell cause damage to building foundations through subsidence, creating 
  a problem for householders and the housing insurance industry (Building Research 
  Establishment, 1990). Crack formation also results in more rapid and direct 
  movement of water and solutes from surface soil to permeable substrata or drainage 
  installations through bypass flow (Armstrong et al., 1994; Flurry et al., 1994). 
  This will decrease the filtering function of soil and increase the possibility 
  of nutrient losses and water pollution (Rounsevell et al., 1999). </p>

<h4><a name="132122"></a>13.2.1.2.2. Land degradation processes </h4>
<p>Accumulation of salts in soils (salinization) results from capillary movement 
  and dispersion of saline water because evapotranspiration is greater than precipitation 
  and irrigation (Vàrallyay, 1994). Such conditions, which are widespread throughout 
  the warmer and drier regions of southern Europe, will be exacerbated by temperature 
  rise coupled with reduced rainfall. Climate change also will increase flood 
  incidence and salinity along coastal regions, through the influence of sea-level 
  rise (Nicholls, 2000). </p>
<p>A decrease in precipitation and/or increase in temperature increases oxidation 
  and loss of volume in lowland peat soils that are used for agriculture. It has 
  been suggested that under climate change, the volume of peats in agricultural 
  use will shrink by 40% (Kuntze, 1993). Some peat soils in western Europe are 
  associated with acid sulfate conditions (Dent, 1986); strong acidity largely 
  precludes agricultural use (Beek et al., 1980). Soil acidification also can 
  result from depletion of basic cations through leaching (Brinkman, 1990) where 
  the soil is well drained and structurally stable and experiences high rainfall 
  amounts and intensity-as in many upland areas of Europe. In wetter climate, 
  soil acidification could increase if buffering pools become exhausted, although 
  for most soils this will take a very long time. </p>
<p>Climate change is likely to increase wind and water erosion rates (Rosenberg 
  and Tutwiler, 1988; Dregne, 1990; Botterweg, 1994), especially where the frequency 
  and intensity of precipitation events grows (Phillips et al., 1993). Erosion 
  rates also will be affected by climate-induced changes in land use (Boardman 
  et al., 1990) and soil organic carbon contents (Bullock et al., 1996). Relatively 
  small changes in climate may push many Mediterranean areas into a more arid 
  and eroded landscape (Lavee et al., 1998) featuring decreases in organic matter 
  content, aggregate size, and stability and increases in sodium adsorption ratio 
  and runoff coefficient. However, increased erosion in response to climate change 
  cannot be assumed for all parts of Europe. For example, in upland grazed areas, 
  erosion rates will be reduced as a result of better soil surface cover and topsoil 
  stability arising from higher temperatures that extend the duration of the growing 
  season and reduce the number of frosts (Boardman et al., 1990). </p>
<h4><a name="132123"></a>13.2.1.2.3. Biologically mediated soil properties </h4>
<p>Climate change will impact directly on SOM through temperature and precipitation 
  (Tinker and Ineson, 1990; Cole et al., 1993; Pregitzer and Atkinson, 1993) and 
  indirectly (and possibly more importantly) through changing land use (e.g., 
  Hall and Scurlock, 1991). SOM contents increase with soil water content and 
  decrease with temperature (Post et al., 1982, 1985; Robinson et al., 1995), 
  although rates of decomposition vary widely between different soil carbon pools 
  (van Veen and Paul, 1981; Parton et al., 1987; Jenkinson, 1990). Changes in 
  SOM contents depend on the balance between carbon inputs from vegetation and 
  carbon losses through decomposition (Lloyd and Taylor, 1994); most SOM is respired 
  by soil organisms within a few years. Net primary productivity (NPP) usually 
  increases with increasing temperature and elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  leading to greater returns of carbon to soils (Loiseau et al., 1994). However, 
  increasing temperature strongly stimulates decomposition (Berg et al., 1993; 
  Lloyd and Taylor, 1994; Kirschbaum, 1995) at rates that are likely to outstrip 
  NPP and lead to reduced SOM contents (Kirshbaum et al., 1996). This effect will 
  be strongest in cooler regions of Europe, where decomposition rates currently 
  are slow (Jenny, 1980; Post et al., 1982; Kirschbaum, 1995). Conversely, excess 
  soil water resulting from increased precipitation will reduce decomposition 
  rates (Kirschbaum, 1995) and thus increase SOM contents. </p>
<p>Plant growth and soil water use are strongly influenced by the availability 
  of nutrients. Where climatic conditions are favorable for plant growth, the 
  shortage of soil nutrients will have a more pronounced effect (Shaver et al., 
  1992). Increased plant growth in a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched atmosphere may rapidly 
  deplete soil nutrients; consequently, the positive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase may not persist as soil fertility decreases (Bhattacharya and Geyer, 
  1993). Increased SOM turnover rates over the long term are likely to cause a 
  decline in soil organic nitrogen in temperate European arable systems (Bradbury 
  and Powlson, 1994), although, in the short term, increased returns of carbon 
  to soils would maintain soil organic nitrogen contents (Pregitzer and Atkinson, 
  1993; Bradbury and Powlson, 1994). Greater mineralization may cause an increase 
  in nitrogen losses from the soil profile (e.g., Kolb and Rehfuess, 1997; Lukewille 
  and Wright, 1997), although there is evidence to suggest that temperature-driven, 
  increased nitrogen uptake by vegetation may reduce these losses (Ineson et al., 
  1998). </p>
<p>There is great uncertainty surrounding the response of soil community function 
  to global change and the potential effects of these responses at the ecosystem 
  level (Smith et al., 1998). Most soil biota have relatively large temperature 
  optima and therefore are unlikely to be adversely affected by climate change 
  (Tinker and Ineson, 1990), although some evidence exists to support changes 
  in the balance between soil functional types (Swift et al., 1998). Soil organisms 
  will be affected by elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations where 
  this changes litter supply to and fine roots in soils, as well as by changes 
  in the soil moisture regime (Rounsevell et al., 1996b). Furthermore, the distribution 
  of individual species of soil biota will be affected by climate change where 
  species are associated with specific vegetation and are unable to adapt at the 
  rate of land-cover change (Kirschbaum et al., 1996). </p>
