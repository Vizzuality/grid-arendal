<h3>10.2.6. Desertification </h3>
<h4>10.2.6.1. Context<a name="10261"></a></h4>
<p>The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines desertification 
  as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid areas resulting 
  from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities" 
  (United Nations, 1994). Furthermore, UNCCD defines land degradation as a "reduction 
  or loss, in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid areas, of the biological or economic 
  productivity and complexity of rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, 
  pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or 
  combination of processes, including processes arising from human activities 
  and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil erosion caused by wind and/or water; 
  (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical, and biological or economic properties 
  of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation."</p>
<p>Arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid areas include those lands where the ratio 
  of precipitation to potential evaporation (PET) ranges from 0.05 to 0.65. In 
  Africa, these conditions cover 13 million km<sup>2</sup> (see <a href="#fig109">Figure 
  10-9</a>), or 43% of the continent's land area&#151;on which 270 million 
  people, or 40% of the continent's population, live (UNDP, 1997). Areas 
  particularly at risk include the Sahel&#151;a 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> band 
  of semi-arid lands stretching along the southern margin of the Sahara Desert&#151;and 
  some nations that consist entirely of drylands (e.g., Botswana and Eritrea). 
  The death of as many as 250,000 people in the Sahel drought of 1968-1973 
  (UNCOD, 1977) demonstrated the tragic human toll of desertification.</p>

<p><a name="fig109"></a>Desertification in Africa has reduced by 25% the potential 
  vegetative productivity of more than 7 million km<sup>2</sup>, or one-quarter 
  of the continent's land area (UNEP, 1997). Desertification consists more 
  of degradation of the productive capacity of patches well outside open-sand 
  deserts rather than the inexorable encroachment of open sand onto greenlands. 
  Arid lands can respond quickly to seasonal fluctuations. Indeed, analysis of 
  1980-1990 NDVI data to track the limit of vegetative growth along the Sahara-Sahel 
  margin revealed wide fluctuations: The 1990 limit of vegetative growth lay 130 
  km south of its 1980 position (Tucker <i>et al.,</i> 1991).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the relative importance of climatic (see <a href="403.htm">Section 
  10.2.6.3</a>) and anthropogenic (see <a href="#10262">Section 10.2.6.2</a>) 
  factors in causing desertification remains unresolved. Some scientists have 
  judged that anthropogenic factors outweigh climatic factors (Depierre and Gillet, 
  1971; Lamprey, 1975; Le Hou&eacute;rou, 1989; Westing, 1994), though others 
  maintain that extended droughts remain the key factor (Mortimore, 1989; Hoffman 
  and Cowling, 1990; Tucker <i>et al., </i>1991; Dodd, 1994). CO<sub>2</sub>-induced 
  climate change and desertification remain inextricably linked because of feedbacks 
  between land degradation and precipitation (see <a href="403.htm#10264">Section 
  10.2.6.4</a>).</p>
<h4>10.2.6.2. Nonclimatic Driving Forces of Desertification<a name="10262"></a></h4>
<p>Unsustainable agricultural practices, overgrazing, and deforestation constitute 
  the major anthropogenic factors among the forces that drive desertification. 
  Unsustainable agricultural practices include short rotation of export crops, 
  undisciplined use of fire, and removal of protective crop residues. Overgrazing 
  consists of running livestock at higher densities or shorter rotations than 
  an ecosystem sustainably can support. Finally, deforestation consists of permanent 
  clearing of closed-canopy forests and cutting of single trees outside forests. 
  Forest area in Africa decreased by approximately 37,000 km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  from 1990 to 1995 (FAO, 1999a). UNEP (1997) attributes two-thirds of the area 
  already desertified in Africa to overgrazing and the remaining third to unsustainable 
  agricultural and forestry practices.</p>
<p>Population growth ultimately can drive desertification if it intensifies agrosylvopastoral 
  exploitation or if it increases the land area subjected to unsustainable agricultural 
  practices, overgrazing, or deforestation. The total population of Africa grew 
  from 220 million in 1950 to 750 million in 1998&#151;a rate of 2.5% yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (United Nations, 1999). Increasing food, wood, and forage needs accompanying 
  this growth place an inordinate burden on the region's natural resources.</p>
