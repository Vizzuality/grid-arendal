<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Although many resource systems and populations exhibit high degrees of resilience 
  and adaptive capacity, there is a significant risk that critical thresholds 
  may be breached as a result of climate change, undermining this resilience. 
  The environmental risks in a region could vary significantly for different sectors, 
  depending on the degree of warming. To develop a risk profile for precautionary 
  management of climate change, it is necessary to assess the critical climate 
  threshold for a region for each of the relevant priority sectors, such as water 
  and agriculture. For instance, a small degree of surface warming could be beneficial 
  for agriculture in Russia but may be detrimental in India or Bangladesh. Increased 
  glacier melt in the Himalayas may cause serious floods in Nepal, India, and 
  Bangladesh. The potential environmental risks to water and marine resources 
  in marginal seas of Asia such as the Sea of Japan, Bohai Bay, and the Yellow 
  Sea also will depend on the degree of climate change&#151;which could differ 
  significantly in these regions. For many countries in Asia, there is sparse 
  scientific research on the evaluation of sector-specific critical climatic thresholds. 
  The response of driving forces such as economic growth, population increase, 
  and technological progress in each country or region also should be included 
  in the determination of thresholds for precautionary risk management as an adaptation 
  strategy to climate change.</p>
<p>Rapid demographic transition accompanying significant economic growth is likely 
  in many Asian countries in the 21st century. These trends exacerbate pressures 
  on resource use, the climate system, and the natural environment. Population 
  growth and varying economic and technological conditions in Asia are likely 
  to affect some societies and resources more than changes in climate per se. 
  Moreover, socioeconomic and technological developments will interact with many 
  vulnerable sectors. However, predicting population growth rates and future economic 
  conditions is as uncertain an exercise as predicting the future climate. Institutional 
  and legal structures may change and will co-evolve with climatic risks. GHG 
  emission scenarios are especially important, but future emission trends will 
  depend on population growth and prevailing economic and technological conditions. 
  There have been limited studies that simultaneously take into account climate 
  change and other human-induced stresses. For vulnerability and adaptation to 
  be addressed comprehensively, they must be considered in a context of multiple 
  stresses caused by climate change and other anthropogenic activities.</p>
<p><a href="#tab1111">Table 11-11</a> summarizes the vulnerability of key sectors, 
  from food and fiber through settlements, for subregions of Asia. This summary 
  is derived from a synthesis of available scientific research reviewed in this 
  chapter; it represents a consensus view of the authors. Levels of confidence 
  assigned to vulnerability also are shown in <a href="#tab1111">Table 11-11</a>, 
  again based on iterative assessment of the available scientific evidence. Currently 
  available research synthesized in this table reveals a wide range of vulnerability, 
  as well as a wide range of uncertainties in the assessment of these vulnerabilities. 
  Geographical resolution as well as integration and scaling of basic physical 
  and biological responses are the key factors contributing to these uncertainties. 
  The limited database also makes it difficult to aggregate various responses 
  with only a few sample or spot assessments. Nevertheless, some key trends emerge 
  from the synthesis. A consistent message is the vulnerability of south and southeast 
  Asia across many sectors, as well as a high degree of confidence about this 
  assertion. Across virtually all subregions, water resources and natural ecosystems 
  are appraised as highly vulnerable to climate change, although the level of 
  confidence varies for some regions because of lack of data or greater complexity 
  in the resource systems. There may be some minor benefits to boreal Asia, making 
  it more resilient to potential impacts, but natural ecosystems clearly are under 
  threat in this subregion.</p>
