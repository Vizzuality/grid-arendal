<h4>10.2.5.5. Human Comfort</h4>
<p>McMichael <i>et al</i>. (1996) found a relationship between ambient temperature 
  and heat-related mortalities in Cairo, Egypt. This suggests a need to consider 
  building technology and building materials' thermal properties to produce 
  dwellings that are naturally climatically comfortable for tropical conditions. 
  In Africa, there is a tendency to construct dwellings that do not take account 
  of local climate because of inadequate natural ventilation and use of large 
  decorative glass surfaces. Similarly, urban planners need to consider landscaping 
  to avoid inner-city congestion that leads to unhealthy microclimate enclaves.</p>
<p>A combination of high temperatures and air pollution leads to increases in 
  respiratory complaints. Clean air policies would not only alleviate health hazards 
  but would be a contribution toward maintenance of the ozone layer in line with 
  the Montreal Protocol. Sudden imposition of stringent air quality standards 
  may cause undue strain to the economy, but graduated improvement of air quality 
  standards, at a pace the economy can absorb, will be beneficial in terms of 
  adaptation to climate change as well as general city health improvement.</p>
<h4>10.2.5.6. Water Resources<a name="10256"></a></h4>
<p><a href="383.htm">Section 10.2.1</a> argues that future water resources for 
  subhumid regions of Africa will be in jeopardy under global warming conditions. 
  The impact of climate change to settlements, through the water resources pathway, 
  will have multiple manifestations in all walks of life.</p>
<p>Adaptive measures include incentives for a water conservation culture, such 
  as water pricing. However, many rural communities are not economically or culturally 
  attuned to commercialization of water resources, which normally are administered 
  in a common access mode. Commoditization of water resources as a strategy for 
  efficient water use is contingent on comparable growth of economic activity 
  and social well-being in all sectors of communities.</p>
<p>Land degradation has resulted in siltation thus disappearance of surface streamwater 
  resources (Magadza, 1984). States are encouraged to consider measures that will 
  rehabilitate streams, paying special attention to wetlands conservation, with 
  an added bonus of biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>Industrial water cycling in Africa is poorly developed. Processes that maximize 
  water recycling should be encouraged.</p>
<p>At the regional level, there are beginnings of cooperation in interbasin transfers 
  from water-surplus areas to water-deficit areas; the proposed diversion of Zambezi 
  River waters toward the south is an example. Although this development will 
  enhance the status of water and other natural resources as tradable commodities, 
  the groundwork for legal regulation of water sharing between nations of the 
  region must be developed sooner rather than later to avoid situations of water-related 
  political tensions like those in the Middle East and north Africa (Caponera, 
  1996).</p>
<h4>10.2.5.7. Sanitation<a name="10257"></a></h4>
<p><a href="396.htm">Section 10.2.4</a> draws attention to the possible health 
  implications of climate change and climate variability through vector- and water-borne 
  pathogens. In many African urban settlements, urban drift has outpaced the capacity 
  of municipal authorities to provide civic works for sanitation and other health 
  delivery services. The outbreak of cholera during recent floods in east Africa 
  and Mozambique underscores the need for adequate sanitation. It should be noted 
  that although the outbreaks were spread from as far north as Mombassa and Nairobi 
  in the north to Beira in the south, incidences remained localized to the outbreak 
  centers because of the isolated nature of the affected urban areas. If settlement 
  conglomerations such as those envisaged for west Africa and the eastern seaboard 
  of South Africa develop&#151;as discussed by Nicholls <i>et al. </i>(1999)&#151;vulnerable 
  population and areas will tend to be regional, rather than local. Review of 
  sanitary facilities now rather than later will not only be beneficial to communities 
  now but in the long run will be cost saving for long-term health delivery services.</p>
<h4>10.2.5.8. Food Security<a name="10258"></a></h4>
<p>Droughts in SSA often translate to famine, which leads to acceleration of urban 
  drift to cities that are not equipped to absorb such migrations. Although maintenance 
  of strategic food reserves is one coping mechanism, development policies increasingly 
  must create other investment opportunities in rural areas besides agriculture, 
  to diversify means of survival and, indeed, create rural wealth (De Lattre, 
  1988). </p>
<p>In semi-arid Africa, pastoralism is the main economic activity. Many pastoral 
  communities include transnational migrants in search of new seasonal grazing. 
  In drought situations, such pastoralists may come into conflict with settled 
  agrarian systems (Anon, 1992; Lado, 1995; Cousins, 1996). Students of pastoralism 
  note the lack of clear policies on pastoralists, who normally are marginalized 
  in state agricultural policies.</p>
