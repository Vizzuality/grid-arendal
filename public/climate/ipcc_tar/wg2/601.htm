<h3><a name="1622"></a>16.2.2. Changes around the Antarctic Peninsula</h3>
<p>At least five meteorological records from scientific stations on the Antarctic 
  Peninsula show marked decadal warming trends (King, 1994; Harangozo <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; King and Harangozo, 1998; Marshall and King, 1998; Skvarca <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Although the periods and seasons of observations have been different, the records 
  show consistent warming trends&#151;as much as 0.07&deg;C yr<sup>-1</sup>, considerably 
  higher than the global mean. This atmospheric warming has caused several notable 
  changes in the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula, including changes in snow 
  elevation (Morris and Mulvaney, 1995; Smith <i>et al</i>., 1999a) and the extent of 
  surface snow cover (Fox and Cooper, 1998). The most important change has been 
  the retreat of ice shelves. Seven ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have 
  shown significant, progressive, and continued retreat. On the West Coast, the 
  Wordie Ice Shelf, M&uuml;ller Ice Shelf, George VI Ice Shelf, and Wilkins Ice 
  Shelf have retreated (Ward, 1995; Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Luchitta and Rosanova, 
  1998). On the east coast, the ice shelves that occupied Prince Gustav Channel 
  and Larsen Inlet and Larsen Ice Shelf A have retreated (Rott <i>et al</i>., 1996; Vaughan 
  and Doake, 1996; Skvarca <i>et al</i>., 1998). Following Mercer (1978), Vaughan and 
  Doake (1996) show that the pattern of retreat could be explained by a southerly 
  movement of the 0&deg;C January isotherm, which appears to define a limit of 
  viability for ice shelves. To date, about 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ice shelf 
  have been lost.</p>

<p><a name="fig165"></a>Retreat of the ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula 
  has attracted considerable media coverage, and environmental campaigns of some 
  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have expressed concern that these events 
  presage a more important collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. However, 
  few direct impacts result from the loss of these ice shelves. The ice shelves 
  were floating, so their melting does not directly add to sea level, and they 
  usually are replaced by sea-ice cover, so overall albedo changes very little. 
  Because the Antarctic Peninsula is steep and rugged, there is no evidence that 
  removal of ice shelves will cause melting of the glaciers that fed them to accelerate 
  and add to sea-level rise (Vaughan, 1993). Terrestrial ecosystems generally 
  will be unaffected by ice-shelf retreat. Most polar benthic organisms, especially 
  in the Antarctic, grow extremely slowly, so colonization of exposed seabed will 
  be slow. <br>
</p>
<p>Because warming on the Antarctic Peninsula exceeds that over much of the rest 
  of the continent (Jacka and Budd, 1998), migration of the limit of viability 
  for ice shelves probably will not affect the Ronne-Filchner or Ross ice shelves 
  in the next 100 years (Vaughan and Doake, 1996). A substantial increase in Antarctic 
  summer temperatures, however, would threaten other large ice shelves beyond 
  the Antarctic Peninsula. The real implications of ice-shelf retreat are that 
  it highlights issues of risk perception and public understanding of climate 
  change, rather than real physical impacts. These issues include questions such 
  as: Does the Antarctic Peninsula warming result from a global effect, or simply 
  from natural regional climate variations? Such problems of attribution of climate 
  change will recur, especially if the costs of adaptation are to be spread across 
  nations. The inherent nonlinearity of natural systems sometimes causes exaggerated 
  local responses to small climate changes. In the present generation of climate 
  models, the Antarctic Peninsula is not well resolved, so local effects on these 
  scales cannot yet be reproduced. Confidence in predicting such changes in the 
  natural ecosystems of the Antarctic Peninsula comes from observed changes on 
  the terrestrial biota of southern ocean islands (Bergstrom and Chown, 1999). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Rapidly increasing temperatures have been directly implicated in colonization 
  by introduced species and displacement of indigenous biota. Thus, the extent 
  of higher terrestrial vegetation on the Antarctic Peninsula currently is increasing 
  (Fowber and Lewis Smith, 1994). In the marine environment, the warming trend 
  on the Antarctic Peninsula has been linked statistically to an associated change 
  in sea ice for this region (Stammerjohn and Smith, 1996). For example, Smith 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999b) show that rapid climate warming and associated reduction in sea 
  ice are concurrent with a shift in the population size and distribution of penguin 
  species in the Antarctic Peninsula region.<br>
