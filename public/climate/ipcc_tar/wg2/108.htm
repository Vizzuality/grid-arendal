<h3>2.6.4. Aggregation and the Cascade of Uncertainty</h3>

      Figure 2-2:</b> Range of major uncertainties that are typical in impact 
      assessments, showing the "uncertainty explosion" as these ranges 
      are multiplied to encompass a comprehensive range of future consequences, 
      including physical, economic, social, and political impacts and policy responses 
      (modified after Jones, 2000, and "cascading pyramid of uncertainties" 
      in Schneider, 1983)</td>

<a name="fig22"></a>A single aggregated damage function or a "best guess" 
climate sensitivity estimate is a very restricted representation of the wide range 
of beliefs available in the literature or among lead authors about climate sensitivity 
or climate damages. If a causal chain includes several different processes, the 
aggregate distribution might have very different characteristics than the various 
distributions that constitute the links of the chain of causality (see Jones, 
2000). Thus, poorly managed projected ranges in impact assessment may inadvertently 
propagate uncertainty. The process whereby uncertainty accumulates throughout 
the process of climate change prediction and impact assessment has been described 
as a "cascade of uncertainty" (Schneider, 1983) or the "uncertainty 
explosion" (Henderson-Sellers, 1993). The cascade of uncertainty implied 
by coupling the separate probability distributions for emissions and biogeochemical 
cycle calculations to arrive at concentrations needed to calculate radiative forcing, 
climate sensitivity, climate impacts, and valuation of such impacts into climate 
damage functions has yet to be produced in the literature (see Schneider, 1997, 
Table 2). When the upper and lower limits of projected ranges of uncertainty are 
applied to impact models, the range of possible impacts commonly becomes too large 
for practical application of adaptation options (Pittock and Jones, 1999). This 
technique is less explicitly applied in assessments where two or more scenarios 
(e.g., M1 to M4 in <a href="104.htm#fig21">Figure 2-1</a>) are used and the results 
expressed as a range of outcomes. If an assessment is continued through to economic 
and social outcomes, even larger ranges of uncertainty can be accumulated (see 
<a href="#fig22">Figure 2-2</a>). 
<p>Because of the lack of consistent guidance on the treatment of uncertainties, 
  diversity of subject areas, methods, and stage of development of the many fields 
  of research to be assessed in the SAR, it was not possible to agree on a single 
  set of terms to describe the confidence that should be associated with the many 
  outcomes and/or processes that had been assessed. Thus, the uncertainties guidance 
  paper (see also <a href="055.htm#box11">Box 1-1</a>) suggests that the TAR authors 
  agree on two alternative sets of terms from which writing teams can select (see 
  Figures 2 and 3 in Moss and Schneider, 2000). As noted in the decision analysis 
  literature (e.g., Morgan and Henrion, 1990), <i>it is important to attach a 
  quantitative range to each verbal characterization</i> to assure that different 
  users of the same language mean the same degree of confidence.</p>
