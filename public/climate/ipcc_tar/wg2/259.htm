<h3>5.7.2. Pressures on Goods and Services </h3>
<p>People expect drinkable, swimmable, boatable, and fishable freshwaters. However, 
  rivers and lakes have many pressures. These pressures include land and water 
  use for urbanization, agriculture, and aquaculture; hydrologic engineering structures 
  such as dams, dykes, channelization, and construction of drainage and connecting 
  canals; water extractions for industry, drinking water, irrigation, and power 
  production; water pollution with toxics, excess nutrients, and suspended sediments; 
  capture fisheries; and invasion of exotics. UV-B is an interactive pressure 
  with climate change owing to the change in water clarity influenced by drought. 
  Under these conditions, UV-B penetrates farther and causes more damage in clear 
  waters than in murky waters.</p>
<p>Human demand for water in many areas will increase more rapidly with climate 
  change and population increases and leave fewer waters unmodified by water projects 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Water projects interact with many aspects 
  of climate change as related to natural resource and environmental management. 
  Additional dams will increase the difficulty of managing migratory fish populations 
  in streams. Sedimentation that occurs above dams will reduce downstream transport 
  of sand, sediments, and toxic substances. Lakes and reservoirs with increased 
  water withdrawals will reduce the suitability of the littoral zone for fish 
  spawning and nursery areas. Diversions of water by canals, ships, or pipes will 
  transport exotics into new watersheds and confound biodiversity and exotics 
  issues. </p>
<h3><a name="573"></a>5.7.3 Responses of Lakes and Streams and Impacts on their 
  Goods and Services</h3>
<p>Many responses of lakes and streams to climate change were documented in the 
  SAR by Arnell et al. (1996), and more have been added by Cushing (1997) and 
  Domoto et al. (2000). Responses include warming of waters; reductions in ice 
  cover; reduction in dissolved oxygen in deep waters; changes in the interaction 
  between waters and their watersheds; changes in biogeochemical cycling; greater 
  frequencies of extreme events, including flood and drought; changes in growth, 
  reproduction, and distribution of organisms; and poleward movement of climate 
  zones for organisms. Only a few are mentioned in the following subsections.</p>
