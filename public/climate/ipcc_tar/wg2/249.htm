<h4>5.6.2.4. Land-Use Change </h4>
<p>Land-use change, including deforestation, is still considered to be a large 
  pressure on global forests (Alcamo et al., 1998). Several factors contribute 
  to deforestation in tropical regions, including income and population growth, 
  road-building policies, and other government policies (Southgate, 1998). Conversion 
  to agriculture is impractical in boreal systems because of low productivity 
  and high access costs, but some boreal forests continue to be converted to second-growth, 
  managed forests. In temperate regions, conversion of agricultural lands back 
  to forest has increased with agricultural productivity and falling prices (Kuusela, 
  1992; UN-ECE/FAO, 2000a). There is some evidence that these trends will continue, 
  although at a lower rate (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000a). Factors affecting these trends 
  include urbanization, agricultural yields and prices, timber prices, access 
  and conversion costs, and subsidy programs (such as those that promote afforestation 
  for environmental reasons, including mitigation of climate change impacts).</p>
<h4><a name="5625"></a>5.6.2.5. Other Pressures </h4>
<p>Fragmentation of forest landscapes as a result of climate change, land-use 
  practices, and disturbance is expected to take place in advance of larger scale 
  biome shifts (Fahrig and Merriam, 1994; Shriner et al., 1998). Fragmentation 
  can change biodiversity and resiliency (Sala et al., 2000). Fragmentation of 
  the landscape can occur as a result of disturbance (natural or anthropogenic) 
  or more gradually from successional responses to environmental changes (NBIOME 
  SSC, 1992).</p>
<p>Pressures from air pollution and air quality: There is evidence of decline 
  in forest condition as a result of air pollution, especially in areas adjacent 
  to industrial areas and large cities (e.g., deposition of heavy metals, sulfur, 
  nitrogen, and ozone) (Nilsson et al., 1998). Of major concern is increased nitrogen 
  deposition caused by industrial processes and agriculture (Vitousek et al., 
  1997b). Nitrogen deposition is higher in northern Europe than elsewhere (Vitousek 
  et al., 1997b). Low-level increases in nitrogen deposition associated with air 
  pollution have been implicated in productivity increases over large regions 
  (Schindler and Bayley, 1993; Vitousek et al., 1997b). Temperate and boreal forests, 
  which historically have been nitrogen-limited, appear to be most affected (Townsend 
  and Rastetter, 1996; Vitousek et al., 1997b). In other areas that become nitrogen-saturated, 
  other nutrients are leached from the soil, resulting in forest dieback (Vitousek 
  et al., 1997b)&#151;counteracting, or even overwhelming, any growth-enhancing 
  effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment.</p>
<p>Tropospheric ozone has been shown to impact the structure and productivity 
  of forest ecosystems throughout industrialized countries (Chameides et al., 
  1994; Weber et al., 1994; Grulke et al., 1998) and is likely to increase in 
  extent with further industrial development and agriculture management (Chameides 
  et al., 1994). It has been suggested that the impact of ozone damage is reduced, 
  but not eliminated, by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> (Tingey et al., 2001). </p>
<p>In developed countries, the major impacts of air pollution on forest services 
  are likely to be on recreation and non-wood products. Air pollution has been 
  shown not to have significant impacts on industrial timber markets in the United 
  States (Haynes and Kaiser, 1990), although European timber market studies suggest 
  potentially larger local effects (Nilsson et al., 1992). Although increasing 
  industrialization in developing countries that have less restrictive air pollution 
  requirements could have effects on local industrial or fuelwood markets, these 
  increases are not expected to have major effects on global timber supply. </p>
