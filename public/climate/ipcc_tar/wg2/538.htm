<h4>14.2.3.2. Ecological and Local Community Values</h4>
<p>Many local communities depend on coastal wetlands for survival; they use a 
  wide range of natural products from the swamps and their surrounding waters 
  (Field, 1997; RAMSAR, 1999). As<a href="299.htm#654"> Section 6.5.4</a> points 
  out, in some coastal societies, cultural values are of equal&#151;or even greater&#151;significance 
  than economic values. This is particularly true in Ecuador and Colombia on the 
  Pacific coast, as well as the most northern part of Venezuela and Brazil on 
  the Atlantic coast, where shrimp farming and timber exploitation represent the 
  most common uses (Schaeffer-Novelli and Cintron, 1993; Sebastiani<i> et al.,</i> 
  1996; Trujillo, 1998). Girot (1991) identifies the landscape and the aesthetics 
  and spirituality of local people as important social and cultural impacts in 
  the Central American region. An increase in sea level could affect monuments 
  and historic sites of Central America.</p>
<p>Patterns of human development and social organization in a community are important 
  factors in determining the vulnerability of people and social institutions to 
  sea-level rise and other coastal hazards. The most common problems in local 
  subsistence economies in Latin America coastal zones relate to firewood, isolation 
  from enforcement, shrimp ponds, cattle, clearing for village expansion, coconut 
  plantation, and sewage and garbage disposal (Sebastiani<i> et al.</i>, 1996; 
  Ellison and Fanrsworth, 1997). </p>
<h3>14.2.4. Water Resources: Availability and Use <a name="1424"></a></h3>
<p>Water resources for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, averaged per 
  capita among Latin American countries, vary from 28,739 m<sup>3</sup> in Argentina 
  (whose population is 34,587,000) to more than 472,813 m<sup>3</sup> in Suriname 
  (whose population is 423,000) (see Appendix D of IPCC, 1998). These averages 
  hide the enormous disparity in many areas, such as poor rural areas, which are 
  ill-supplied. In some Latin American regions&#151;especially in areas where 
  it is possible that the combined effect of less rainfall and more evaporation 
  could take place, leading to less runoff&#151;global warming will substantially 
  change the availability of freshwater. Watersheds in arid or semi-arid regions 
  are especially sensitive because annual runoff already is highly variable (Medeiros, 
  1994). Watersheds in the southern hemisphere where snowmelt is an important 
  source of runoff also can be severely affected (Basso, 1997). Vulnerability 
  of oases between 29&deg;S and 36&deg;S to drier conditions in the high Andes 
  can be observed (Canziani <i>et al.,</i> 1997) </p>
<p>Few specific water resources impact studies using climate change scenarios 
  have been conducted in Latin America: Riebsame <i>et al</i>. (1995) studied 
  the Uruguay River basin. In the study, all scenarios used indicated a shift 
  of seasonality and a decrease in runoff during low-flow periods. For the Choqueyapu 
  River (La Paz, Bolivia) under a UKMO-89 climate scenario, these studies projected 
  an increase of discharge in the low-water period and in the months of December 
  and January. For some other watersheds (Caire, Mamor&eacute;, Guadalquivir, 
  and Miguillas), the magnitude and tendency of the results varies, depending 
  on the scenario used (PNCC, 1997). For the Pirai River, located in a humid area 
  and flowing through urban areas (Santa Cruz City), runoff increases under an 
  increased precipitation scenario (PNCC, 2000). Estimates of water availability 
  in Mexico and Central America (Izmailova and Moiseenko, 1998) indicate that 
  about 70% of the population in those countries will live in regions with low 
  water supply as soon as the first quarter of the 21st century. A study using 
  climate scenarios from GFDL, GISS, and NCAR models, combined with incremental 
  scenarios of 1-2&deg;C temperature rise and 10% precipitation increase, 
  found that decreasing precipitation in Mexico and El Salvador can cause a change 
  in runoff by 5-7% but that in the winter runoff changes by only by 0.2-0.7%.</p>
<p>Potential changes in temperature and precipitation might have a dramatic impact 
  on the pattern and magnitude of runoff, soil moisture, and evaporation, as well 
  as the aridity level of some hydrological zones in Mexico (Mendoza<i> et al.</i>, 
  1997). A vulnerability study performed in conjunction with the National GHG 
  Inventory in Argentina foresees a reduction in water availability as a result 
  of changes in snowmelt in the high Andes. Similar studies in Peru show that 
  warming has created several environmental hazards, such as avalanches in Peruvian 
  Andean valleys, with a foreseen critical reduction of water resources for human 
  and industrial consumption (Morales-Arnao, 1999).</p>
<p>Water use in Latin America is mainly for agricultural activities, averaging 
  nearly 60% of total water use. It ranges from approximately 40% in Colombia 
  and Venezuela to more than 75% in Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
  Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, and Uruguay 
  (Canziani <i>et al.,</i> 1998). Even with a potential increase in water availability 
  in some parts of northern Mexico (Mundo and Mart&iacute;nez-Austria, 1993; Maga&ntilde;a 
  and Conde, 1998), demand for water from agricultural, urban, and industrial 
  sectors has shown a much faster growth because of the rapid expansion of these 
  sectors in recent decades.</p>
<p>Some hydrological scenarios for Cuba (Planos and Barros, 1999) show that a 
  significant limitation of potential water resources will occur within the next 
  century as a result of increments in evapotranspiration and changes in precipitation.
