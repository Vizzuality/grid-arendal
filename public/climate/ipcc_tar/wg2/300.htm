<h2>6.6. Adaptation</h2>
<a name="661"></a>
<h3>6.6.1. Evolution of Coastal Adaptation Options</h3>
<p>In the SAR, Biljsma <i>et al.</i> (1996) identified three possible coastal response 
  options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Protect,</i> which aims to protect the land from the sea so that existing 
    land uses can continue, by constructing hard structures (e.g., seawalls) as 
    well as using soft measures (e.g., beach nourishment) 
  <li><i>Accommodate</i>, which implies that people continue to occupy the land 
    but make some adjustments (e.g., elevating buildings on piles, growing flood- 
    or salt-tolerant crops) 
  <li><i>Retreat</i>, which involves no attempt to protect the land from the sea; 
    in an extreme case, the coastal area is abandoned. 
</ul>
<p>An evaluation of such strategies was regarded as a crucial component of the 
  vulnerability assessment Common Methodology. Klein and Nicholls (1999) argue, 
  however, that as far as adaptation is concerned, that methodology has been less 
  effective in assessing the wide range of technical, institutional, economic, 
  and cultural elements in different localities. Indeed, they indicated that there 
  has been concern that the methodology emphasizes a protection-oriented response 
  rather than consideration of the full range of adaptation options. </p>
<p>Klein <i>et al.</i> (2000) develop a methodology that seeks to address some of these 
  comments. They argue that successful coastal adaptation embraces more than just 
  selecting one of the technical options to respond to sea-level rise; it is a 
  more complex and iterative process, with a series of policy cycles. Four steps 
  can be distinguished in the process of coastal adaptation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Information collection and awareness raising
  <li>Planning and design
  <li>Implementation
  <li>Monitoring and evaluation.
</ol>
<p>In reality, however, adaptive responses often are undertaken reactively rather 
  in a step-wise, planned, and anticipatory fashion.</p>
<p>The process of coastal adaptation can be conceptualized by showing that climate 
  change and/or climate variability, together with other stresses on the coastal 
  environment, produce actual and potential impacts. These impacts trigger efforts 
  of mitigation, to remove the cause of the impacts, or adaptation to modify the 
  impacts. Bijlsma <i>et al.</i> (1996) noted that climate-related changes represent 
  potential additional stresses on systems that already are under pressure. Climate 
  change generally will exacerbate existing problems such as coastal flooding, 
  erosion, saltwater intrusion, and degradation of ecosystems. At the same time, 
  nonclimate stresses can be an important cause of increasing coastal vulnerability 
  to climate change and variability. Given such interactive effects, adaptation 
  options to be most effective should be incorporated with policies in other areas, 
  such as disaster mitigation plans, land-use plans, and watershed resource plans. 
  In other words, adaptation options are best addressed when they are incorporated 
  in integrated coastal management and sustainable development plans.</p>
<p>Policy criteria and coastal development objectives condition the process of 
  adaptation. Other critical influences include values, awareness, and factors 
  such as historical legacies, institutions, and laws. There is growing recognition 
  of the need for researchers, policymakers, residents, and other key stakeholders 
  to work together to establish a framework for adaptation that is integrated 
  within current coastal management processes and practices and takes a broader 
  view of the subject. Collaborative efforts of this kind can support a process 
  of shared learning and joint problem solving, thereby enabling better understanding, 
  anticipation of, and response to climate change. Cash and Moser (2000) identify 
  some of the deficiencies in integrating science and policy. They suggest the 
  following guidelines for meeting the challenge: Use "boundary organizations" 
  that can link researchers and decisionmakers at various scales, capitalize on 
  particular scale-specific capabilities, and develop adaptive assessment and 
  management strategies through long-term iterative processes of integrated assessment 
  and management.</p>
