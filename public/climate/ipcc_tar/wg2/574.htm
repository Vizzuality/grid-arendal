<h3><a name="1525"></a>15.2.5. Human Settlements and Infrastructure </h3>
<p>Large metropolitan centers and industrial areas are particularly vulnerable 
  to global environmental change (Schmandt and Clarkson, 1992). Large cities are 
  considered to be areas of high risk because warming could lead to problems such 
  as heat stress, water scarcity, and intense rainfall. Other potential impacts 
  vary with location. In Canada and the northern United States, for example, people 
  in larger cities are expected to experience fewer periods of extreme winter 
  cold (Born, 1996). Many coastal communities will be affected by rising sea levels 
  and increased risk of storm surge, but the impacts will differ because of variations 
  in local and regional factors (Nicholls and Mimura, 1998). Most people in North 
  America live in land that now is considered coastal and subject to coastal weather 
  extremes. This sector of the urban population is growing faster than the population 
  as a whole&#151;a trend that is expected to continue (Boesch <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Indeed, "25 percent of the buildings within 500 feet of U.S. coastlines 
  are predicted to fall victim to erosion in the next six decades" (Associated 
  Press, 2000). Cities that are vulnerable to regular flooding may experience 
  changes in the timing, frequency, and severity of this hazard (Weijers and Vellinga, 
  1995). In addition, the risk of increased periods of drought will be a challenge, 
  particularly for communities that already are struggling to cope with water 
  management issues. Overall, climate change should reduce vulnerability to some 
  hazards such as cold waves but increase it with respect to others such as sustained 
  periods of extreme heat.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="15251"></a>15.2.5.1. Demographic Pressures</h4>
<p>The number of people in North America increased from 83 million in 1901 to 
  301 million in 1998 (Statistics Canada, 1999a; U.S. Census Bureau, 1999b). The 
  number living in large urban communities of more than 750,000 people increased 
  over this period from 6 million to more than 140 million. A higher share of 
  the population in North America lives in large urban centers (45% in 1995) than 
  in any other region of the world (UNDP, 1999). These large population centers 
  may be vulnerable to climate change.<br>
</p>
<p>Aging of the population is another important demographic trend in North America. 
  Europe and Japan currently are adapting to an aging of the population that is 
  just emerging in North America. These demographic trends also appear in native 
  communities with individuals living to older ages: Elderly people who have lived 
  away from reservations may return home for retirement. An older population typically 
  is more vulnerable to climate extremes (McMichael, 1997).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="15252"></a>15.2.5.2. Infrastructure Investments in Adaptation </h4>
<p>Many systems have the potential to be impacted negatively by climate change, 
  including drainage and water systems, roads and bridges, and mass transit (Miller, 
  1989). Communities can reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience 
  to adverse impacts from climate change through investments in adaptive infrastructure 
  (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 1999a).<br>
</p>
<p>Across North America, however, government spending on public infrastructure 
  has been declining for some time, measured as a share of economic activity. 
  Almost 3.5% of GDP was spent on a broad range of infrastructure projects in 
  the early 1960s, compared to less than 2% in the 1990s (Statistics Canada, 1999b; 
  USBEA, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Sustained lower spending has increased society's vulnerability to some 
  hazards. The American Society of Civil Engineers, for example, has warned that 
  many dams in the United States have exceeded their intended lifespan (Plate 
  and Duckstein, 1998). More than 9,000 regulated dams have been identified as 
  being at high risk of failing, and there may be significant loss of life and 
  property from future failures.<br>
</p>
<p>Highways, bridges, culverts, residences, commercial structures, schools, hospitals, 
  airports, coastal ports, drainage systems, communications cables, transmission 
  lines, and other infrastructure have been built on the basis of historical climate 
  experience (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 1999a). Similarly, land-use practices and building 
  codes have been developed to provide effective protection from the existing 
  climate. Emerging knowledge about future climate pressures was not available 
  when most investment decisions were made. This includes, for example, recent 
  research into actions that can be taken to protect underground transit systems 
  from the increased risk of intense rainfall and subsequent flooding (Liebig, 
  1997). Furthermore, building codes have been modified frequently over the years 
  to reflect emerging information about safer construction techniques, but these 
  changes have not been applied to existing structures.<br>
</p>
<p>Coastal communities have developed a variety of systems to manage exposure 
  to erosion, flooding, and other hazards affected by rising sea levels, but some 
  of these systems have not been maintained&#151;increasing the difficulty of 
  putting in place enhancements to address future risk. Similarly, consideration 
  of investments in larger diameter storm sewers in communities that expect more 
  periods of intense rainfall may be affected by the age of existing systems (Fowler 
  and Hennessey, 1995; Trenberth, 1998). Urban expansion and population growth 
  further complicate decisionmaking with respect to infrastructure investments.</p>
