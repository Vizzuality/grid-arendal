<h2>12.4. Ecosystems and Conservation </h2>
<a name="1241"></a> 
<h3>12.4.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Until recent settlement, Australia and New Zealand were isolated for millions 
  of years, and their ecosystems have evolved to cope with unique climate and 
  biological circumstances (Kemp, 1981; Nix, 1981). Despite large year-to-year 
  climatic variability, many Australian terrestrial species have quite limited 
  ranges of long-term average climate, on the order or 1-2&deg;C temperature 
  and 20% in rainfall (Hughes <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Pouliquen-Young and Newman, 
  1999). Thus, these ecosystems are vulnerable to climatic change, as well as 
  invasion by exotic animals and plants. </p>
<p>Rapid land clearance and subsequent land-use change have been occurring as 
  a result of human activity over the past 500-1,000 years in New Zealand 
  (McGlone, 1989; Wilmshurst, 1997) and, in Australia, subsequent to Aboriginal 
  arrival tens of thousands of years ago&#151;and especially since European settlers 
  arrived 200 years ago. This has led to loss of biodiversity in many ecosystems 
  as well as loss of some ecosystems as a whole. One of the major impacts has 
  been an increase in weedy species in both countries. This is likely to continue 
  and be exacerbated by climate change. Land-use change also has led to fragmentation 
  of ecosystems and to salinization through rising water tables. These trends 
  can inhibit natural adaptation to climate change via the dispersal/migration 
  response. Systems therefore may be more vulnerable, and some might become extinct. 
  For example, Mitchell and Williams (1996) have noted that habitat that is climatically 
  suitable for the long-lived New Zealand kauri tree <i>Agathis australis</i> 
  under a 4&deg;C warming scenario would be at least 150 km from the nearest extant 
  population. They suggest that survival of this species may require human intervention 
  and relocation. Similar problems have been identified by Pouliquen-Young and 
  Newman (1999) in relation to fragmented habitat for endangered species in the 
  southwest of western Australia.</p>
<p>Many of the region's wetlands, riverine environments, and coastal and 
  marine systems also are sensitive to climate variations and changes. A key issue 
  is the effect on Australia's coral reefs of greenhouse-related stresses 
  in addition to nonclimatic features such as overexploitation and increasing 
  pollution and turbidity of coastal waters from sediment loading, fertilizers, 
  pesticides, and herbicides (Larcombe <i>et al.</i>, 1996). </p>

<h3>12.4.2. Forests and Woodlands</h3>
<p>In Australia, some 50% of the forest cover in existence at the time of European 
  settlement still exists, although about half of that has been logged (Graetz 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995; State of the Environment, 1996). Pressures on forests and 
  woodlands as a whole are likely to decrease as a result of recent legislation 
  relating to protection of forests in some Australian states, and as interest 
  in carbon sequestration increases. In New Zealand (Taylor and Smith, 1987), 
  25% of the original forest cover remains, with 77% in the conservation estate, 
  21% in private hands, and 2% state owned. Legal constraints on native wood production 
  mean that only about 4% currently is managed for production, and clear-felling 
  without replacement has virtually ceased.</p>
<p>The present temperature range of 25% of Australian Eucalyptus trees is less 
  than 1&deg;C in mean annual temperature (Hughes <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Similarly, 
  23% have ranges of mean annual rainfall of less than 20% variation. The actual 
  climate tolerances of many species are wider than the climate envelope they 
  currently occupy and may be affected by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, 
  which change photosynthetic rates and water-use efficiency (WUE) and may affect 
  the temperature response (Curtis, 1996). Such changes from increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  would be moderated by nutrient stress and other stressors that are prevalent 
  across Australian forests. Nevertheless, if present-day boundaries even approximately 
  reflect actual thermal or rainfall tolerances, substantial changes in Australian 
  native forests may be expected with climate change. Howden and Gorman (1999) 
  suggest that adaptive responses would include monitoring of key indicators, 
  flexibility in reserve allocation, increased reserve areas, and reduced fragmentation.</p>
<p>In a forested area in western Australia that is listed as one of 25 global 
  "biodiversity hotspots" for conservation priority by Myers <i>et al.</i> 
  (2000), Pouliquen-Young and Newman (1999) used the BIOCLIM program (Busby, 1991) 
  to generate a climatic envelope from the present distribution of species. They 
  assessed the effects of three incremental temperature and rainfall scenarios 
  on three species of frogs, 15 species of endangered or threatened mammals, 92 
  varieties of the plant genus <i>Dryandra</i>, and 27 varieties of <i>Acacia</i> 
  in the southwest of western Australia. The scenarios were based on the spatial 
  pattern of change from the CSIRO RCM at 125-km resolution, scaled to the IS92 
  global scenarios. For plant species, suitability of soils also was considered. 
  The results indicate that most species would suffer dramatic decreases in range 
  with climate warming; all of the frog and mammal species studied would be restricted 
  to small areas or would disappear with 0.5&deg;C global-average warming above 
  present annual averages, as would 28% of the <i>Dryandra</i> species and one 
  <i>Acacia</i>. At 2&deg;C global average warming, 66% of the <i>Dryandra</i> 
  species, as well as all of the <i>Acacia</i>, would disappear. Adaptation opportunities 
  were considered minimal, with some gain from linking present conservation reserves 
  and reintroducing endangered species into a range of climatic zones.</p>
<p>Studies of the current distribution of New Zealand canopy trees in relation 
  to climate suggest that major range changes can be expected with warming (Whitehead 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Leathwick <i>et al.</i> 1996; Mitchell and Williams, 1996). 
  Trees in the highly diverse northern and lowland forests (e.g., <i>Beilschmiedia 
  tawa</i>) are likely to expand their ranges southward and to higher altitudes. 
  The extensive upland <i>Nothofagus</i> forests are likely to be invaded by broad-leafed 
  species. Few tree species are confined to cool southern climates; those that 
  are have a wide altitudinal range available for adjustment of their distribution, 
  so no extinctions are expected. Most concern centers on the ability of tree 
  species to achieve new distributions rapidly enough in a fragmented landscape, 
  as well as invasion of natural intact forests by exotic tree, shrub, and liana 
  species that are adapted to warm temperate or subtropical climates. </p>

<h3>12.4.3. Rangelands</h3>
<p>In Australia, rangelands are important for meat and wool production. In their 
  natural state, rangelands are adapted to relatively large short-term variations 
  in climatic conditions (mainly rainfall and temperature). However, they are 
  under stress from human activity, mostly as a result of animal production, introduced 
  animals such as rabbits, inappropriate management, and interactions between 
  all of these factors (Abel <i>et al.</i>, 2000). These stresses, in combination 
  with climatic factors, have led to problems of land degradation, salinization, 
  and woody weed invasion and subsequent decreases in food production. In some 
  cases, native dominant species (mostly plants) have been replaced by exotic 
  species, leading to a decrease in population of many native animal species. 
  Woody weed invasion also has changed the fire regime through formation of "thickets" 
  that do not allow fires through, partly as a result of the fire resistance of 
  some species (Noble <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Some Australian rangelands also are 
  vulnerable to salinization resulting from rising water tables from irrigation 
  and loss of native vegetation (see <a href="470.htm#123">Section 12.3</a>). 
</p>
<p>New Zealand rangelands are used predominantly for sheep grazing. Intensive 
  use of indigenous grasslands and shrublands on land cleared of trees in the 
  19th century has increased vulnerability to invasion, especially by woody weeds 
  (pine, broom, gorse, etc.) and herbaceous weeds (hawkweed, thistles, and subtropical 
  grasses). Weed invasions are unlikely to further increase the susceptibility 
  of the system to climatic disruptions but could themselves be accelerated by 
  warming or increased climatic variability. Fire is now strictly regulated, although 
  rangeland fires remain a serious problem, especially in ENSO drought years. 
  Rangelands&#151;in particular, in drier areas of eastern South Island&#151;have 
  many problems, including animal and plant pests and declining profitability 
  of farming, leading to a decline in management and fertilizer inputs.</p>
<p>Increased CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to have beneficial effects for native pastures, with 
  possible nitrogen limitation and increased subsoil drainage (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999d). Runoff and groundwater recharge also could increase (Krysanova <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). This could lead to increased salinization problems in areas that are 
  susceptible. However, decreases in rainfall in excess of about 10% at the time 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling would dominate over the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect and lead to 
  a decline in pasture productivity. This is more likely in the latest climate 
  change scenarios that are based on coupled AOGCM results. Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) 
  conclude that a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will result in only limited changes 
  in the distribution of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grasses and that such changes will be moderated 
  by warmer temperatures.</p>
