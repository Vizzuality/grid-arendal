<h3>10.1.3. Past to Present</h3>
<h4>10.1.3.1. Climatology<a name="10131"></a></h4>
<p>Africa is a vast continent, and it experiences a wide variety of climate regimes. 
  The location, size, and shape of the African continent play key roles in determining 
  climate. The poleward extremes of the continent experience winter rainfall associated 
  with the passage of mid-latitude airmasses. Across the Kalahari and Sahara deserts, 
  precipitation is inhibited by subsidence virtually throughout the year. In contrast, 
  moderate to heavy precipitation associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence 
  Zone (ITCZ) characterizes equatorial and tropical areas. Because the movement 
  of the ITCZ follows the position of maximum surface heating associated with 
  meridional displacement of the overhead position of the sun, near-equatorial 
  regions experience two rain seasons, whereas regions further poleward experience 
  one distinct rainfall season. The mean climate of Africa is further modified 
  by the presence of large contrasts in topography (Semazzi and Sun, 1995) and 
  the existence of large lakes in some parts of the continent. </p>
<h4>10.1.3.2. Interannual and Interdecadal Climate Variability <a name="10132"></a></h4>
<p>Humans have adapted to patterns of climate variability through land-use systems 
  that minimize risk, with agricultural calendars that are closely tuned to typical 
  conditions and choices of crops and animal husbandry that best reflect prevailing 
  conditions. Rapid changes in this variability may severely disrupt production 
  systems and livelihoods. Interannual variability of the African climate is determined 
  by several factors. The El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most 
  dominant perturbation responsible for interannual climate variability over eastern 
  and southern Africa (Nicholson and Entekhapi, 1986). The typical rainfall anomaly 
  associated with ENSO is a dipole rainfall pattern: Eastern Africa is in phase 
  with warm ENSO episodes, whereas southern Africa is negatively correlated with 
  these events (Nicholson and Kim, 1997). The 1997-1998 ENSO event resulted 
  in extreme wet conditions over eastern Africa (see <a href="#box101">Boxes 10-1</a> 
  and <a href="#box102">10-2</a>), and the 1999-2000 La Ni&ntilde;a may have 
  caused devastating floods in Mozambique. Modeling exercises indicate that climate 
  change may increase the frequency of ENSO warm phases by increasing the warm 
  pool in the tropical western Pacific or by reducing the efficiency of heat loss 
  (Trenberth and Hoar, 1997; Timmerman <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>

          <td><b>Box 10-1. The 1997-1998 ENSO Event</b> 
            <p>ENSO appears to play a major role in east Africa, but it masks 
              the perhaps more important role of the other oceans, particularly 
              the Indian Ocean. The 1961-1962 rains were spectacularly manifested 
              as rapid rises in the levels of east African lakes. Lake Victoria 
              rose 2 m in little more than a year (Flohn and Nicholson, 1980). 
              This was not an ENSO year, but exceedingly high sea-surface temperatures 
              (SSTs) occurred in the nearby Indian Ocean as well as the Atlantic. 
              Such high SSTs are associated with most ENSO events, and it is probably 
              SSTs in these regions, rather than the Pacific ENSO (Nicholson and 
              Kim, 1997), that have the largest influence on east African rainfall. 
              In another example, the dipole pattern anticipated to occur during 
              ENSO events did not occur during the 1997-1998 event. There 
              was a tremendous increase in rainfall in east Africa, but intense 
              drought conditions did not occur throughout southern Africa. The 
              reason appears to be an unusual pattern of SST in the Indian Ocean.</p>

          <td><b>Box 10-2. Drought Conditions in the Sahel </b> 
            <p>One of the most significant climatic variations has been the persistent 
              decline in rainfall in the Sahel since the late 1960s. The trend 
              was abruptly interrupted by a return of adequate rainfall conditions 
              in 1994. This was considered to be the wettest year of the past 
              30 and was thought to perhaps indicate the end of the drought. However, 
              by the standard of the whole century, rainfall in 1994 barely exceeded 
              the long-term mean. Also, the 1994 rainy season was unusual in that 
              the anomalously wet conditions occurred toward the end of the rainy 
              season and in the months following. Unfortunately, dry conditions 
              returned after 1994. The persistent drying trend has caused concern 
              among development planners regarding how to cope with losses of 
              food production, episodes of food insecurity, displacements of populations, 
              lack of water resources, and constraints on hydroelectricity.</p>

<p>In the Sahel and similar regions of west Africa, the problem is more complex. 
  ENSO appears to influence year-to-year variations and reduces rainfall. Its 
  influence appears to be greater within long dry intervals in the Sahel, but 
  it is not the dominant factor controlling rainfall in this region (Ward, 1998).</p>
<p>Over northern Africa, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a key factor 
  that is responsible for interannual variability of the climate (Lamb, 1978). 
  Across western Africa, year-to-year changes in seasonal climatic conditions 
  are determined primarily by the Atlantic Ocean, although the rest of the world's 
  oceans also play important roles. Low-lying islands and coastal regions receive 
  significant amounts of rainfall from tropical cyclone activity, which is sensitive 
  to interannual variability of SST conditions over adjacent ocean basins. <br>
  <br>
  The climate of Africa also exhibits high interdecadal variability. Rainfall 
  variability in the Sahel derives from factors such as SST and atmospheric dynamics 
  (Lamb, 1978; Folland <i>et al.,</i> 1986; Hulme and Kelly, 1997; Nicholson and 
  Kim, 1997) and is modulated by land surface effects related to soil moisture, 
  vegetation cover, dust, and so forth (Charney, 1975; Diedhiou and Mahfouf, 1996; 
  Xue, 1997; Zeng <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Modeling evidence also suggests that orographic 
  control plays a significant role in promoting climate teleconnections between 
  global SST anomalies and west African interannual climate variability (Semazzi 
  and Sun, 1997).</p>

<a name="fig101"></a>Besides ENSO, the NAO, and west African climate anomaly patterns, 
other continental-scale and subcontinental climate anomalies play significant 
roles in determining interannual and longer climate variability time scales (Nicholson 
<i>et al.,</i> 2000). For instance, the decade 1950-1959 was characterized 
by above-normal precipitation over most of Africa, although rainfall deficiencies 
prevailed over the near-equatorial region. Later, during the period 1960-1969, 
this rainfall anomaly pattern dramatically reversed in sign, with rainfall deficits 
observed for most of Africa while the equatorial region experienced widespread 
abundance of rainfall. These two time periods also coincide with a reversal in 
the sign of the Sahelian rainfall anomalies (Lamb and Peppler, 1992). More recently, 
the pattern has been one of increased aridity throughout most of the continent. 
Mean rainfall decreased by 20-49% in the Sahel between the periods 1931-1960 
and 1968-1997 and generally 5-10% across the rest of the continent (see 
<a href="#fig101">Figure 10-1</a>).In comparison with the period between 1950 
and 1970, the average length of the rainy season has not changed significantly 
during the dry period 1970-1990. Instead, the decrease in rainfall in July 
and August explains most of the diminution of total annual rainfall over the Sahel 
since 1970. The average number of rainy events in August was reduced by about 
30% (Le Barb&eacute; and Lebel, 1997). 
<p>There is emerging evidence that aerosols and dust also may be important factors 
  in modulating the variability of the African climate (d'Almeida, 1986; 
  Mohamed <i>et al., </i>1992; Pinker <i>et al.,</i> 1994). These studies provide 
  overwhelming evidence of an extremely dense and deep (reaching up several kilometers) 
  dust layer in the Sahel/Sudan during the main dust season from November to April.</p>
