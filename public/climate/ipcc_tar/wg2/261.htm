<h4>5.7.3.1.2. Direct use of water </h4>
<p>Intensification in direct uses of water will negatively influence "natural" 
  waters and could seriously reduce services provided by these ecosystems. Some 
  values and services of lakes and rivers would be degraded by human responses 
  to their greater demands for water for direct human use through dam construction, 
  dyke and levee construction, water diversions, and wetland drainage (Postel 
  and Carpenter, 1997). Such activities can alter water temperatures, recreation, 
  pollution dilution, hydropower, transportation, and the timing and quantity 
  of river flows; lower water levels; destroy the hydrologic connection between 
  the river and the river floodplain; reduce natural flood control, nutrient and 
  sediment transport, and delta replenishment; eliminate key components of aquatic 
  environments; and block fish migration. At risk are aquatic habitat, biodiversity 
  habitat, sport and commercial fisheries, waterfowl, natural water filtration, 
  natural floodplain fertility, natural flood control, and maintenance of deltas 
  and their economies (Ewel, 1997). </p>
<p>Water-level increases as well as decreases can have negative influences on 
  lakes and streams. A recent example is from Lake Baikal, where the combined 
  influences of a dam on the outlet and increased precipitation has increased 
  water level by 1.5 m and decreased biodiversity and fishery production (Izrael 
  et al., 1997; ICRF, 1998).</p>

<p><a name="fig57"></a>Potential effects of climate change on fisheries are documented 
  in the SAR by Everett et al. (1996); freshwater fisheries in small rivers and 
  lakes are considered to be more sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation 
  than those in large lakes and rivers. Changes in temperature and precipitation 
  resulting from climate change are likely to have direct impacts on freshwater 
  fisheries through changes in abundance, distribution, and species composition. 
  Because current exploitation rates tend to be high or excessive, any impact 
  that concentrates fish will increase their catchability and further stress the 
  population. </p>
<p>Assessing the potential impacts of climate change on aquaculture is uncertain, 
  in part because the aquaculture industry is mobile and in a period of rapid 
  expansion. There is no question that large abundances relative to traditional 
  wild harvests can be produced in small areas and that in many cases these sites 
  can be moved to more favorable locations. Changes in groundwater may be especially 
  significant for aquaculture. In tropical areas, crustaceans are cultured in 
  ponds (Thia-Eng and Paw, 1989); fish frequently are cultured in cages. Commonly 
  cultured species such as carp and tilapia may grow faster at elevated temperatures, 
  but more food is required and there is an increased risk of disease. Temperature 
  is a key factor affecting growth, but other factors relating to water quality 
  and food availability can be important. Modeling studies suggest that for every 
  1&deg;C average increase, the rate of growth of channel catfish would increase 
  by about 7%, and the most favorable areas for culture would move 240 km northward 
  in North America (McCauley and Beitinger, 1992; see <a href="#fig57">Figure 
  5-7</a>, right panel). The southern boundary also would move northward as surface 
  water temperatures increase, perhaps exceeding lethal ranges on occasion. Growth 
  would increase from about 13 to 30&deg;C and then fall off rapidly as the upper 
  lethal limit of about 35&deg;C is reached (McCauley and Beitinger, 1992). Thus, 
  aquaculture for traditional species at a specific location may have to switch 
  to warmer water species. </p>
<p>Warmer conditions are more suitable for warmer loving flora and fauna and less 
  suitable for cold-loving flora and fauna. Warmer temperatures, however, lead 
  to higher metabolic rates, and if productivity of prey species does not increase, 
  reductions in growth would occur at warmer temperatures (Arnell et al., 1996; 
  Magnuson et al., 1997; Rouse et al., 1997). Rates of natural dispersal across 
  land barriers of less mobile species poleward or to higher altitudes are not 
  likely to keep up with rates of change in freshwater habitats. Species most 
  affected would include fish and mollusks; in contrast, almost all aquatic insects 
  have an aerial life history stage, thus are less likely to be restricted. Some 
  streams have a limited extent and would facilitate only limited poleward or 
  altitudinal dispersal. This could be especially problematic as impoundments 
  restricting movements of organisms increase in number. Coldwater species and 
  many coolwater species would be expected to be extirpated or go extinct in reaches 
  where temperatures are at the warmer limits of a species range. Many lakes do 
  not have surface water connections to adjacent waters, especially in headwater 
  regions where interlake movement would be limited without human transport of 
  organisms across watershed boundaries. </p>
<p>Exotics will become a more serious problem for lake and stream ecosystems with 
  warming. In the northern hemisphere, for example, range extensions occur along 
  the northern boundaries of species ranges and extinctions occur along the southern 
  boundaries, in natural waters and in aquaculture operations (Arnell et al., 
  1996; Magnuson et al., 1997). In addition, loss of habitat for biodiversity 
  will result from warmer, drier conditions interacting with increases in impoundment 
  construction. </p>
<p>Distributions of fish are simulated to move poleward across North America and 
  northern Europe. In northern Europe, Lehtonen (1996) forecasts a shrinking range 
  for 11 coldwater species and an expanding range for 16 cool- and warmwater fish. 
  In simulations for Finland by Lappalainen and Lehtonen (1995), lake whitefish 
  lost habitats progressively toward the north, whereas brown trout did better, 
  at least in the north. Coolwater fish were forecast to spread northward through 
  the country. In simulation studies, boundaries of individual warmwater species 
  ranges in were projected to move northward by 400-500 km in Ontario, Canada 
  (Minns and Moore, 1995), and southern boundaries of coldwater fishes were projected 
  to move 500-600 km northward in the southeastern United States (estimated 
  from Fang et al., 1998). In simulations based on an elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  scenario using the Canadian Climate Centre model, warmwater fish were projected 
  to benefit in shallow eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes around the United States, 
  owing to reduction in winterkill, but habitable lakes and streams for coolwater 
  fish and especially coldwater fish were projected to decline, owing to summer 
  kill (Fang et al., 1998; Mohseni and Stefan, 2000). Habitat changes from various 
  studies over large regions (see <a href="#fig57">Figure 5-7</a>, center panel) 
  projected 0-43% reductions for coldwater species, 50% reductions to 12% 
  increases for coolwater species, and 14% reductions to 31% increases for warmwater 
  fish. Changes differ among ecosystem types and areas, depending on latitude 
  and altitude. </p>
<p>A dramatic picture of the regional decline in trout habitat in the Rocky Mountain 
  region of the western United States is provided by Keleher and Rahel (1996) 
  (see <a href="#fig57">Figure 5-7</a>, left panel). Even a 1&deg;C increase in 
  mean July air temperatures is simulated to decrease the length of streams inhabitable 
  by salmonid fish by 8%; a 2&deg;C increase causes a reduction of 14%, a 3&deg;C 
  increase causes a 21% decline, a 4&deg;C increase causes a 31% reduction, and 
  a 5&deg;C increase causes a 43% reduction. There also is likely to be a increased 
  fragmentation of inhabitable areas for the North Platte River Drainage in Wyoming 
  (Rahel et al., 1996).</p>
