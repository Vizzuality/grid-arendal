<h2>9.10. Demographic and Economic Disruption</h2>
<p>Health impacts associated with population displacement fall under two general 
  categories: health impacts resulting from the new ecological environment and 
  health impacts resulting from the living environment in refugee camps (Prothero, 
  1994). Even displacement from longer term cumulative environmental deterioration 
  is associated with such health impacts. Cumulative changes that may cause population 
  displacement include land degradation, salinity, deforestation, waterlogging, 
  desertification, and water scarcity. When pastoralists in west Africa were forced 
  to move because of reduced pasture and water, they were faced with new ecological 
  conditions. They experienced psychological stress and were more at risk of infectious 
  diseases (Stock, 1976; Prothero, 1994). Climate change may affect human security 
  via changes in water supplies and/or agricultural productivity (Lonergan, 1998, 
  1999). An increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events also would 
  be disruptive to political stability. </p>
<p>Immediate environmental catastrophes can force sudden displacement of a population. 
  In these cases, adverse health impacts usually result from living in refugee 
  camps in overcrowded, poor accommodations with inadequate food, water supplies, 
  sanitation, and waste disposal (Shears <i>et al</i>., 1985; Noji, 1997). These 
  conditions predispose people to parasitic and communicable diseases such as 
  malaria and cholera, respiratory infections, intestinal disorders, malnutrition, 
  and psychological stress (Prothero, 1994). <br>
</p>
<p>The potential impacts of sea-level rise on the health and well-being of coastal 
  populations are an important consideration (Klein and Nicholls, 1999). Estimates 
  of the potential number of people at risk from sea-level rise are addressed 
  elsewhere in TAR WGI and this volume. For example, a 0.5-m rise in sea level 
  along the Nile delta would flood 32% of urban areas, resulting in a significant 
  loss of shelter and forced migration (El-Raey <i>et al</i>., 1999; see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). In some locations, sea-level rise could disrupt stormwater drainage 
  and sewage disposal and result in salinization of freshwater supplies. It can 
  affect health indirectly by reducing food production&#151;for example, by reducing 
  rice production in low-lying coastal rice paddies. Sea-level rise also could 
  affect the distribution of vector-borne diseases&#151;for example, some of the 
  coastal wetlands of the United States may be flooded, thereby destroying the 
  habitat of the EEE virus. Populations with limited economic, technical, and 
  social resources have increased vulnerability to various infectious, psychological, 
  and other adverse health consequences.</p>

        <p><b>Box 9-3. Understanding El Ni&ntilde;o Can Help Adaptation to Climate 
          Change: Seasonal Climate Forecastin</b></p>
        <p align="left">There is evidence of an association between El Ni&ntilde;o 
          and epidemics of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue in 
          some areas where El Ni&ntilde;o affects the climate (Kovats <i>et al</i>., 
          1999). Malaria transmission in unstable areas is particularly sensitive 
          to changes in climate conditions, such as warming or heavy rainfall 
          (Akhtar and McMichael, 1996; Gupta, 1996; Najera <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
          In Venezuela and Colombia, malaria morbidity and mortality increases 
          in the year following the onset of El Ni&ntilde;o (Bouma and Dye, 1997; 
          Bouma <i>et al</i>., 1997b; Poveda <i>et al</i>., 2000). ENSO also has 
          been shown to affect dengue transmission in some Pacific islands (Hales 
          <i>et al</i>., 1999b), though not in Thailand (Hay <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
          However, in many of the studies that have found a relationship between 
          El Ni&ntilde;o and disease, the specific climate drivers or mechanisms 
          have not been determined. There also are other climate oscillations 
          that are less well studied. Furthermore, there are other important explanations 
          of cyclic epidemics, such as changes in herd immunity (Hay <i>et al</i>., 
          2000). <br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The ENSO phenomenon provides opportunities for early warning 
          of extreme weather, which could improve epidemic preparedness in the 
          future. Seasonal forecasting methods and information have the potential 
          to be used to far greater effect by the health sector (IRI, 1999; Kovats 
          <i>et al</i>., 1999). In addition to these direct applications, attention 
          to the impacts of interannual climate variability associated with the 
          ENSO phenomenon would help countries develop the necessary capacity 
          and preparedness to address longer term impacts associated with global 
          climate change (Hales <i>et al</i>., 2000). On the other hand, there 
          are limitations to using ENSO interannual climate variability to assess 
          potential impacts of long-term climate change. </p>
