<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
The financial services sector&#151;defined as private and public institutions 
that offer insurance, banking, and asset management services&#151;is a unique 
qualitative indicator of the potential socioeconomic impacts of climate change 
because the sector is sensitive to climate change and offers an integrator of 
effects on other sectors. This assessment highlights insurance and other components 
of the financial services sector because they represent a risk-spreading mechanism 
through which the costs of weather-related events are distributed among other 
sectors and throughout society. The effects of natural and human-induced climate 
change on the financial services sector are likely to become manifest primarily 
through changes in the spatial distribution, frequencies, and intensities of ordinary 
and catastrophic weather events. There is high confidence that climate change 
and anticipated changes in weather-related events that are perceived to be linked 
to climate change would increase actuarial uncertainty in risk assessment and 
thus in the functioning of insurance markets. 
<p>The costs of ordinary and catastrophic weather events have exhibited a rapid 
  upward trend in recent decades. Yearly global economic losses<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  from catastrophic events increased from US$4 billion in the 1950s to US$40 billion 
  yr-<sup>1</sup> in the 1990s (all 1999 US$). Including events of all sizes increases 
  these totals by approximately two-fold. The insured portion of these losses 
  rose from a negligible level to US$9.2 billion annually during the same period, 
  with a significantly higher insured fraction in industrialized countries. As 
  a measure of increasing insurance industry vulnerability, the ratio of global 
  property/ casualty insurance premiums to weather-related losses&#151;an important 
  indicator of adaptive capacity&#151;fell by a factor of three between 1985 and 
  1999. <a href="545.htm">Chapter 15</a> discusses insurance issues for North 
  America in depth.</p>
<p>The costs of weather events have risen rapidly despite significant and increasing 
  efforts at fortifying infrastructure and enhancing disaster preparedness. These 
  efforts dampen the observed rise in loss costs to an unknown degree, although 
  the literature attempting to separate natural from human driving forces has 
  not quantified this effect. Demographic and socioeconomic trends are increasing 
  society's exposure to weather-related losses. Part of the observed upward trend 
  in historical disaster losses is linked to socioeconomic factors such as population 
  growth, increased wealth, and urbanization in vulnerable areas, and part is 
  linked to climatic factors such as observed changes in precipitation, flooding, 
  and drought events (e.g., see <a href="325.htm">Section 8.2.2</a> and <a href="377.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>). Precise attribution is complex, and there are differences in the balance 
  of these two causes by region and by type of event. Notably, the growth rate 
  in the damage cost of non-weather-related and anthropogenic losses was one-third 
  that of weather-related events for the period 1960-1999 (Munich Re, 2000). Many 
  of the observed upward trends in weather-related losses are consistent with 
  what would be expected under human-induced climate change.</p>
<p>Recent history has shown that weather-related losses can stress insurance companies 
  to the point of bankruptcies, elevated consumer prices, withdrawal of insurance 
  coverage, and elevated demand for publicly funded compensation and relief. Increased 
  uncertainty regarding the frequency, intensity, and/or spatial distribution 
  of weather-related losses will increase the vulnerability of the insurance and 
  government sectors and complicate adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>The financial services sector as a whole is expected to be able to cope with 
  the impacts of future climate change, although low-probability, high-impact 
  events or multiple closely spaced events could severely affect parts of the 
  sector. Trends toward increasing firm size, greater diversification, greater 
  integration of insurance with other financial services, and improved tools to 
  transfer risk all potentially contribute to this robustness. However, the property/casualty 
  insurance and reinsurance segments have greater sensitivity, and small, specialized, 
  or undiversified companies even run the risk of bankruptcy. The banking industry 
  as a provider of loans may be vulnerable to climate change under some conditions 
  and in some regions. However, in many cases the banking sector transfers its 
  risk back to the insurers who often purchase debt products. </p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change presents complex challenges, but it also presents 
  opportunities to the sector. [It is worth noting that the term "mitigation" 
  often is used in the insurance and financial services sectors in much the same 
  way that the term "adaptation" is used in the climate research and 
  policy communities.] Regulatory involvement in pricing, tax treatment of reserves, 
  and the (in)ability of firms to withdraw from at-risk markets are examples of 
  factors that influence the resilience of the sector. Management of climate-related 
  risk varies by country and region. Usually it is a mixture of commercial and 
  public arrangements and self-insurance. In the face of climate change, the relative 
  role of each can be expected to change. Some potential response options offer 
  co-benefits (e.g., stemming from climate change mitigation opportunities), in 
  addition to helping the sector adapt to climate changes.</p>
<p>The effects of climate change&#151;in terms of loss of life, effects on investment, 
  and effects on the economy&#151;are expected to be greatest in developing countries. 
  Several countries experience impacts on their GDP as a consequence of natural 
  disasters; damages have been as high as half of GDP in one case. Weather disasters 
  set back development, particularly when funds are redirected from development 
  projects to recovery projects.</p>
<p>Equity issues and development constraints would arise if weather-related risks 
  become uninsurable, prices increase, or availability becomes limited. Increased 
  uncertainty could constrain the availability of insurance and investment funds 
  and thus development. Conversely, more-extensive penetration of or access to 
  insurance would increase the ability of developing countries to adapt to climate 
  change. More widespread introduction of microfinancing schemes and development 
  banking also could be an effective mechanism in helping developing countries 
  and communities adapt.</p>
<p>The need for financial resources for adaptation in developing countries is 
  addressed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
  and the Kyoto Protocol. However, development of financing arrangements and analysis 
  of the role of the financial services sector in developed and developing countries 
  still is a relatively unexplored area.</p>
<p>This assessment of financial services identifies some areas of improved knowledge 
  and has corroborated and further augmented conclusions reached in the Intergovernmental 
  Panel on Climate Change's Second Assessment Report (Dlugolecki <i>et al</i>., 
  1996). It also highlights many areas in which greater understanding is needed&#151;in 
  particular, improved knowledge of future patterns of extreme weather; better 
  analysis of economic losses to determine their causation; exploration of financial 
  resources involved in dealing with climate change damage and adaptation; evaluation 
  of alternative methods to generate such resources; deeper investigation of the 
  sector's vulnerability and resilience to a range of extreme weather event 
  scenarios; and more research into how the sector (private and public elements) 
  could innovate to meet the potential increase in demand for adaptation funding 
  in developed and developing countries, both to spread and to reduce risks from 
  climate change.</p>
