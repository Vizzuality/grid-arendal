<h2>17.1. Regional Characteristics </h2>
<h3><a name="1711"></a>17.1.1. Review of Previous Work</h3>
<p>Almost without exception, small island states have been shown to be at great 
  risk from projected impacts of climate change, particularly sea-level rise. 
  The projected global rate of rise of 5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (&plusmn;2-9 
  mm yr<sup>-1</sup> ) is two to four times greater than the rate experienced 
  in the previous 100 years (IPCC, 1998). Many of these islands rarely exceed 
  3-4 m above present mean sea level; even on the higher islands, most of 
  the settlements, economic activity, infrastructure, and services are located 
  at or near the coast. </p>
<p>Reliable instrumental records indicate that on average, Caribbean islands have 
  experienced an increase in temperature exceeding 0.5&deg;C since 1900. During 
  the same period, there has been a significant increase in rainfall variability, 
  with mean annual total rainfall declining by approximately 250 mm. For Pacific 
  islands, the post-1900 temperature increase has been slightly lower than in 
  the Caribbean: less than 0.5&deg;C. In the case of rainfall, no clear trend 
  emerges from the record, which shows decadal fluctuations of &plusmn;200 mm 
  and 50-100 mm for mean annual and mean seasonal totals, respectively (IPCC, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Given the strong influence of the ocean on the climate of islands, and based 
  on projected warming of the oceans (1-2&deg;C for the Caribbean Sea and 
  Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans) with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 
  small islands in these regions are expected to continue to experience moderate 
  warming in the future. Under a similar scenario, mean rainfall intensity also 
  is projected to increase by 20-30% over the tropical oceans, where most 
  small island states are located. However, a decrease in mean summer precipitation 
  over the Mediterranean Sea, where the small islands of Malta and Cyprus are 
  located, is projected (IPCC, 1998).</p>
<p>Based on these projections, certain marine and coastal ecosystems are most 
  likely to be adversely affected. Corals&#151;many species of which currently 
  exist near the upper limits of their tolerance to temperature&#151;are projected 
  to experience more frequent bleaching episodes as a result of elevated sea surface 
  temperatures (SSTs). Bleaching therefore will pose a distinct threat to the 
  productivity and survival of these valuable ecosystems (Wilkinson, 1996; Brown, 
  1997a,b; CARICOMP, 1997; Woodley <i>et al.</i>, 1997). On some islands, mangroves 
  also are expected to be threatened by the impacts of climate change. Where the 
  rate of sedimentation is slower than the projected rate of sea-level rise and 
  where mangroves cannot naturally adapt and migrate landward, the vulnerability 
  of these ecosystems will increase (IPCC, 1996, 1998). In some cases, the natural 
  resilience of these ecosystems already has been impaired by anthropogenic stresses; 
  thus, their capacity to cope with an additional stressor such as climate change 
  will be further compromised. </p>
<p>Sea-level rise poses by far the greatest threat to small island states relative 
  to other countries. Although the severity of the threat will vary from island 
  to island, it is projected that beach erosion and coastal land loss, inundation, 
  flooding, and salinization of coastal aquifers and soils will be widespread. 
  Moreover, protection costs for settlement, critical infrastructure, and economic 
  activities that are at risk from sea-level rise will be burdensome for many 
  small island states. Similarly, tourism&#151;the leading revenue earner in many 
  states&#151;is projected to suffer severe disruption as a consequence of adverse 
  impacts expected to accompany sea-level rise (Teh, 1997; IPCC, 1998).</p>
<h3><a name="1712"></a>17.1.2. Special Circumstances of Small Islands</h3>
<p>Small island states are by no means a homogeneous group of countries. They 
  vary by geography; physical, climatic, social, political, cultural, and ethnic 
  character; and stage of economic development. Yet they tend to share several 
  common characteristics that not only identify them as a distinct group but underscore 
  their overall vulnerability in the context of sustainable development (Maul, 
  1996; Leatherman, 1997). These common characterists include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Limited physical size, which effectively reduces some adaptation options 
    to climate change and sea-level rise (e.g., retreat; in some cases entire 
    islands could be eliminated, so abandonment would be the only option)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Generally limited natural resources, many of which already are heavily stressed 
    from unsustainable human activities<br>
  </li>
  <li>High susceptibility to natural hazards such as tropical cyclones (hurricanes) 
    and associated storm surge, droughts, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions<br>
  </li>
  <li>Relatively thin water lenses that are highly sensitive to sea-level changes<br>
  </li>
  <li>In some cases, relative isolation and great distance to major markets<br>
  </li>
  <li>Extreme openness of small economies and high sensitivity to external market 
    shocks, over which they exert little or no control (low economic resilience)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Generally high population densities and in some cases high population growth 
    rates<br>
  </li>
  <li>Frequently poorly developed infrastructure (except for major foreign exchange-earning 
    sectors such as tourism)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Limited funds and human resource skills, which may severely limit the capacity 
    of small islands to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.</li>
</ul>
