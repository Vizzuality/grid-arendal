<h3>19.6.4. Climate Protection in an Irregular World </h3>
<p>The predictability and manageability of singular phenomena is low. Their impacts 
  can be sudden, large, and irreversible on a time scale of centuries. Regularizing 
  such impacts would be an appropriate response, but this would require much better 
  understanding of the statistics and characteristics of the complex processes 
  involved. The presence of singularities therefore makes analytic and political 
  treatment of the climate change problem particularly difficult.<br>
  Little is known, in quantitative terms, about the potential damages that could 
  be inflicted by singularities on ecosystems and market sectors across the globe. 
  This deficit has two main reasons (see also Moss and Schneider, 2000). First, 
  extensive research on the causes, mechanisms, and impacts of singular events 
  in the context of climate change is just getting started. Second, mechanistic 
  and probabilistic analysis of complex nonlinear systems is more demanding&#151;by 
  orders of magnitude&#151;than investigation of simple linear ones. </p>

      <b>Figure 19-6: </b>Stability of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation 
      (THC) computed with the CLIMBER model (Petoukhov et al., 2000). Degree of 
      shading indicates probability of THC collapse. Light shading denotes low 
      probability; dark shading denotes high probability. The higher the hydrological 
      sensitivity (HHS = high hydrological sensitivity, LHS = low hydrological 
      sensitivity), the faster the rate of temperature increase, or the greater 
      the magnitude of temperature increase, the more likely that the North Atlantic 
      THC becomes unstable. </td>

<p><a name="fig196"></a>The knowledge base for assessing consequences of singularities 
  will probably be broadened considerably over the next 5-10 years. Further 
  advances in simulation modeling soon will allow better projections of future 
  climate variability down to modified extreme events statistics (CLIVAR, 1998), 
  as well as better translations of those projections into impacts on natural 
  and societal systems (e.g., Weyant et al., 1996; Alcamo et al., 1998; Rotmans 
  and Dowlatabadi, 1998). Earth system analysis, as supported by the big international 
  research programs&#151;World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), International 
  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), and International Human Dimensions Programme 
  (IHDP)&#151;will bring about more complete understanding of macro-singularities 
  within the responses of the Earth system under pertinent forcing (Schellnhuber, 
  1999). A major source of information and comprehension, in this context, will 
  be evidence provided by paleorecords (IGBP, 1998). These scientific efforts 
  should assist the decisionmaking process by creating a clearer picture of the 
  future. Unfortunately, creating plausible projections is always tricky in practice 
  (Sarewitz et al., 2000). </p>
<p>A major challenge is to make responsible use of available information regarding 
  the likelihood and the consequences of conceivable singular events. Responsibility 
  here means the obligation of decisionmakers to make the "right" decision, 
  taking into account the diverse societal values and wide ranges of individual 
  interests that are at stake and that may be mutually contradictory. Thus, the 
  standard challenge is to develop proper policies under uncertainty (i.e., neither 
  ignorance nor omniscience) to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC and to satisfy 
  affected stakeholders as well as possible. </p>
<p>A broad and intensive discourse on the ethical aspects of singular responses 
  to climate change (e.g., Markandya and Halsnaes, 2000; Munasinghe, 2000; Toth, 
  2000) is rediscovering many of the arguments put forward in traditional moral 
  philosophy and risk policy. Ethical and procedural aspects of this type have 
  been examined in various other contexts before, where certain concepts (such 
  as human rights) act as a constraint on economic activity (emphasizing utilitarian 
  goals), even when the cost-benefit ratio is unfavorable (e.g., the review of 
  the agricultural situation by Aiken, 1986).</p>
<p>One of the crucial questions is how to deal with high-consequence impacts that 
  may wipe out entire systems or cultures. Such non-implausible "nightmare" 
  or "doomsday" scenarios could result from the speculative but consistent 
  concatenation of individually possible causal relationships (e.g., Schellnhuber 
  and Yohe, 1997). A vexing question is whether the lack of credible scientific 
  evidence for such a scenario provides justification to ignore its possibility 
  completely. Some argue that such effects have to be avoided by all means, irrespective 
  of the economic burdens involved. Others argue that the uncertainties involved 
  do not provide enough support for extensive measures and their economic costs. 
  Within the climate-change framework, however, many incalculable risks could 
  be reduced considerably by more sensible measures. The debate on the "legitimacy" 
  of the different perspectives is impossible to resolve, however (Jasanoff, 1990). 
</p>
<p>The vague evidence provided by the present state of research supports the notion 
  that even relatively small changes in mean climate could lead to large changes 
  in the occurrence of stochastic extreme events. Furthermore, it suggests that 
  large-scale discontinuities are unlikely below a 2&deg;C warming but relatively 
  plausible for a sustained warming of 8-10&deg;C. The relatively small set 
  of investigations discussed above lead to the conclusion that a warming range 
  of 4-5&deg;C seems to represent a critical disturbance regime where macro-discontinuities 
  may start to emerge. This temperature threshold appears to be sensitive to the 
  rate of change at which this level is reached.</p>
