<h3><a name="437"></a>4.3.7. Lakes</h3>
<p>Lakes are particularly vulnerable to changes in climate parameters. Variations 
  in air temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological components directly 
  cause changes in evaporation, water balance, lake level, ice events, hydrochemical 
  and hydrobiological regimes, and the entire lake ecosystem. Under some climatic 
  conditions, lakes may disappear entirely. There are many different types of 
  lakes, classified according to lake formation and origin, the amount of water 
  exchange, hydrochemistry, and so forth.</p>
<p>An important distinction is drawn between closed (endorheic) lakes, with no 
  outflow, and exorheic lakes, which are drained by outflowing rivers. Endorheic 
  lakes are very dependent on the balance of inflows and evaporation and are very 
  sensitive to change in either (whether driven by climate change, climatic variability, 
  or human interventions). This also means that they are very important indicators 
  of climate change and can provide records of past hydroclimatic variability 
  over a large area (e.g., Kilkus, 1998; Obolkin and Potemkin, 1998). Small endorheic 
  lakes are most vulnerable to a change in climate; there are indications that 
  even relatively small changes in inputs can produce large fluctuations in water 
  level (and salinity) in small closed lakes in western North America (Laird et 
  al., 1996). </p>
<p>The largest endorheic lakes in the world are the Caspian and Aral Seas, Lake 
  Balkash, Lake Chad, Lake Titicaca, and the Great Salt Lake. Some of the largest 
  east African lakes, including Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi, also can be regarded 
  as practically endorheic. Changes in inflows to such lakes can have very substantial 
  effects: The Aral Sea, for example, has been significantly reduced by increased 
  abstractions of irrigation water upstream, the Great Salt Lake in the United 
  States has increased in size in recent years as a result of increased precipitation 
  in its catchment, and Qinghai Lake in China has shrunk following a fall in catchment 
  precipitation. Many endorheic lake systems include significant internal thresholds, 
  beyond which change may be very different. Lake Balkash, for example, currently 
  consists of a saline part and a fresh part, connected by a narrow strait. Several 
  rivers discharge into the fresh part, preventing salinization of the entire 
  lake. A reduction in freshwater inflows, however, would change the lake regime 
  and possibly lead to salinization of the freshwater part; this would effectively 
  destroy the major source of water for a large area.</p>
<p>Exorheic lakes also may be sensitive to changes in the amount of inflow and 
  the volume of evaporation. Evidence from Lake Victoria (east Africa), for example, 
  indicates that lake levels may be increased for several years following a short-duration 
  increase in precipitation and inflows. There also may be significant thresholds 
  involving rapid shifts from open to closed lake conditions. Progressive southward 
  expansion of Lake Winnipeg under postglacial isostatic tilting was suppressed 
  by a warm dry climate in the mid-Holocene, when the north basin of the lake 
  became closed (endorheic) and the south basin was dry (Lewis et al., 1998). 
  A trend of progressively moister climates within the past 5,000 years caused 
  a return from closed to open (overflowing) lake conditions in the north basin 
  and rapid flooding of the south basin about 1,000 years later. Other examples 
  include Lake Manitoba, which was dry during the warm mid-Holocene (Teller and 
  Last, 1982). Computations of sustainable lake area under equilibrium water balance 
  (after Bengtsson and Malm, 1997) indicate that a return to dry conditions comparable 
  to the mid-Holocene climate could cause this 24,400-km<sup>2</sup>  lake draining a vast 
  area from the Rocky Mountains east almost to Lake Superior to become endorheic 
  again (Lewis et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Climate change also is likely to have an effect on lake water quality, through 
  changes in water temperature and the extent and duration of ice cover. These 
  effects are considered in <a href="173.htm">Section 4.3.10</a>.</p>
