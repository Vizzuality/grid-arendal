<h4>13.2.1.4. Mountains and Subarctic Environments </h4>
<p>Mountain regions are characterized by sensitive ecosystems, enhanced occurrences 
  of extreme weather events, and natural catastrophes. Often regarded as hostile 
  and economically nonviable regions, mountains have attracted major economic 
  investments for tourism, hydropower, and communication routes. The projected 
  amplitude and rate of climatic change in coming decades is likely to lead to 
  significant perturbations of natural systems as well as the social and economic 
  structure of mountain societies, particularly where these are marginal. Because 
  in many instances mountains and uplands are regions of conflicting interests 
  between economic development and environmental conservation, shifts in climatic 
  patterns probably will exarcerbate the potential for conflict (Beniston, 2000). 
</p>
<p>Nested GCM-regional climate model (RCM) techniques for a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenario 
  have shown that the European Alps are likely to experience slightly milder winters, 
  with more precipitation, than recently. Summer climate, however, may be much 
  warmer and drier than today, as a result of northward shift of the Mediterranean 
  climatic zones (Beniston et al., 1995). These conditions are likely to have 
  adverse effects on the alpine cryosphere and ecosystems. </p>
<p>Impacts of climatic change on physical systems will affect water, snow, and 
  ice, and shifts in extremes will lead to changes in the frequency and intensity 
  of natural hazards. Water availability in some regions may decline because of 
  a reduction in precipitation amounts and because of reduced snow-pack and shorter 
  snow season. Changes in snow amount will lead to significant shifts in the timing 
  and amount of runoff in European river basins, most of which originate in mountains 
  and uplands; this will have numerous consequences for the more populated lowland 
  regions. Floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent. Indirect impacts 
  include changes in erosion and sedimentation patterns, perhaps disrupting hydropower 
  plants (Beniston et al., 1996). </p>
<p>In most temperate mountain regions, the snowpack is close to its melting point, 
  so it is very sensitive to changes in temperature. As warming progresses in 
  the future, current regions of snow precipitation increasingly will experience 
  precipitation in the form of rain. For every 1°C increase in temperature, the 
  snowline rises by about 150 m; as a result, less snow will accumulate at low 
  elevations than today, although there could be greater snow accumulation above 
  the freezing level because of increased precipitation in some regions. A warmer 
  climate will lead to the upward shift of mountain glaciers, which will undergo 
  further reductions. It is likely that in the 21st century, 30-50% of alpine 
  glaciers will disappear (Haeberli, 1995). Permafrost also could be significantly 
  perturbed by warming, leading to a reduction of slope stability and a consequent 
  increase in the frequency and severity of rock and mudslides. These in turn 
  would have adverse economic consequences for mountain communities. </p>
<p>According to S&aelig;tersdal and Birks (1997), mountain plants with narrow July and 
  January temperature tolerances (typically centric species) are most vulnerable 
  to climate warming. These species are characterized by small ranges and population 
  sizes. Holten (1998) documents that these less common centric species have narrow 
  altitudinal ranges-most between 400-600 m in southern Scandes (the Fennoscandian 
  mountain range)-compared with widely distributed mountain plants that have vertical 
  ranges of 800-1,800 m. </p>

<p>Temperature enhancement experiments in the northern Scandes (Henry and Molau, 
  1997; Molau and Alatalo, 1998) have shown disintegration of present plant communities; 
  "arctic specialists," such as Cassiope tetragona and Diapensia lapponica, are 
  least responsive to warming, but soon will suffer competitive exclusion from 
  more competitive evergreen and deciduous dwarfshrubs such as Empetrum hermaphroditum, 
  Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Betula nana, and Salix spp. The latter species are most 
  favored by climatic amelioration (see also Jonasson et al., 1996; Graglia et 
  al., 1997). The following vegetation types are regarded as most sensitive to 
  climate change in the Scandes: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> High-alpine fell-field vegetation: Present plant cover is discontinuous. 
    With available soil resources in combination with extensive seed rain (Molau 
    and Larsson, 2000), rapid colonization by mid-alpine vegetation is expected. 
  <li> Mid-alpine vegetation: Because of a longer thaw season, spatial cover of 
    snowbed communities-including species with high sensitivity to frost and drought-is 
    anticipated to decrease rapidly. 
  <li> Vegetation on cryosoils: As a result of anticipated accelerated degradation 
    of patchy permafrost, the discontinuous vegetation of wet cryosoils (patterned 
    ground and tussock tundra) may be replaced rapidly by low-alpine heath scrub. 
</ul>
<p>As a result of a longer growing season and higher temperatures, European alpine 
  areas will shrink because of upward migration of tree species. After several 
  centuries of invasion of forest into the alpine Scandes, the current alpine 
  area might be reduced by as much as 40-60% (Holten, 1990; Holten and Carey, 
  1992). The speed and extent of upward migration will depend on species as well 
  as physiographic conditions and climatic regimes. Fairly quick response is expected 
  from pioneer species such as mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa). 
  However, there seem to be competing explanations for the response time of migration 
  of the timberline in European mountain ranges and how far timberlines will shift 
  under specific climate scenarios (Woodward, 1992). Under optimal topographic/edaphic 
  conditions, the mountain birch, Scots pine, and Norway spruce treelines might 
  be elevated by as much as 300 m in the continental Scandes and less on the coastal 
  slopes. This will probably take several hundreds of years, at least for the 
  more slowly responding Scots pine and Norway spruce (Aas and Faarlund, 1995; 
  Kullman, 1995). The interaction between climate change, acidification, and nitrogen 
  deposition in alpine ecosystems in the Scandes certainly is very important; 
  to date, however, it has been more or less overlooked (Keller et al., 2000). 
</p>
<p>The predicted future climate suggests that the ranges of many species will 
  extend to higher altitudes. In the topmost zone of the Middle Mountains and 
  the lower external Alps, competition from closed-canopy forest of Norway spruce 
  might restrict the area of small islands of arctic-alpine tundra, destroy patterned 
  grounds and subarctic mires, and kill relict and endemic populations of arctic-alpine 
  organisms (Jenik, 1997). Mountain ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable 
  to climate change in Italy include, for example, shrub vegetation with Pinus 
  mugo of the Apennines (Vaccinio-Piceetalia). This grows 1,500-2,300 m above 
  sea level on glacial residue and is closely dependent on cold continental climate 
  with long-lasting snow cover (Second National Communication on Climate, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Evidence from past climate changes indicates that species respond by migrating 
  rather than by adapting genetically (Huntley, 1991). According to Scharfetter 
  (1938), the warmest interglacial periods enabled forests to climb higher toward 
  the summits of low mountains (1,800-2,300 m), thereby reducing high-elevation 
  orophyte populations. This is relevant for many isolated endemics and orophytes 
  that presently are living in refugia, such as tops of low mountains in the Alps. 
  In such habitats, they will have no possibility to migrate upward, either because 
  they cannot move rapidly enough or because the nival zone already is absent 
  (Gottfried et al., 1994; Grabherr et al., 1994, 1995). </p>
<p>There is broad agreement that past climatic changes have had a strong impact 
  on the distribution ranges of species, and the same can be expected in the future 
  (Peters and Darling, 1985; Ozenda and Borel, 1991, 1995). However, some of these 
  biotic changes are subject to considerable inertia, especially with long-lived 
  plants such as trees. For treelines to expand upslope, a significantly warmer 
  climate is required for at least 100 years (Holtmeier, 1994). Based principally 
  on palynological and macro-fossil investigations, the forest limit did not extend 
  upward more than 100-300 m during the warmest periods of the Boreal and Atlantic 
  periods in the Holocene (e.g., Bortenschlager, 1993; Lang, 1993; Wick and Tinner, 
  1997). An increase in mean annual temperature of 1-2°C may not shift the present 
  forest limit upward by much more than 100-200 m in the Alps. </p>
<p>An increase of 1-2°C is still likely to be in the range of tolerance of most 
  alpine and nival species (Körner, 1995; Theurillat, 1995), whereas a greater 
  increase (3-4°C) may not be (Theurillat, 1995; Lischke et al., 1998; Theurillat 
  et al., 1998). This is particularly relevant for endemics and orophytes with 
  widespread distributions throughout the Alps. Where ranges of species already 
  are fragmented they may become even more fragmented, with regional disappearances 
  if they cannot persist, adapt, or migrate. Some categories of vulnerable plants-for 
  instance, isolated arctic, stenoicous, relict species that are pioneers in wet 
  habitats-may disappear. Specialists in distinct relief situations can suffer 
  from habitat loss through lack of suitable escape routes, as observed from modeling 
  studies (Pauli et al., 1999; Gottfried et al., 2000). Such effects can be pronounced-for 
  instance, in the northeastern Alps, where high numbers of endemics occur in 
  narrow altitudinal ranges (Grabherr et al., 1995). </p>
<p>Biogeographically, the Pyrenees are on the edge between the alpine, central 
  European, and Mediterranean regions. In the eastern Pyrenees around Puigmal 
  (2,910 m), some oro-Mediterranean communities occur, as well as some pasture 
  types with the rude Festuca supina (Baudiere and Serve, 1974). On windier and 
  drier areas, an ecological substitution is taking place: Alpine dense pastures 
  are turning to discontinuous oro-Mediterranean communities. There is ongoing 
  degradation of formerly stable soils and communities as a result of periglacial 
  phenomena, including increased cryoturbation (Baudiere and Gauquelin, 1998). 
  With regard to timberlines in the Pyrenees, Montserrat (1992) demonstrates that 
  they have been moving upward in the postglacial period up to the present. Over 
  1940-1985, an increase in mean annual temperatures is suggested by changes in 
  animal behavior. In Estangento Lake (eastern Pyrenees, 2,035 m), this happens 
  especially in winter months, when the minimum temperatures reach 3°C. This phenomenon 
  affects the hibernation time of a common bat (Miniopterus shreibersi), so that 
  populations enter the caves 1.5 months later than they did 20 years ago. Caves 
  are regarded as stable environments that reflect only general climatic trends 
  (White and Martinez Rica, 1996). </p>
