<h3>8.5.2. Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Because of the lack of insurance, disaster relief is the major input for disaster 
  recovery in many developing countries. After a disaster, the first relief usually 
  is provided by the national government in the form of assistance by the military, 
  the police, and other government services. Often, governments also act as the 
  insurer for uninsured damages in these cases. When the capacity of local disaster 
  relief institutions is exceeded, countries tend to call for help from international 
  institutions. In the period 1992-2000, a yearly average of US$330 million 
  was transferred from country to country for disaster aid (United Nations, 2000).</p>
<p>The institutional setting of international disaster relief is complicated. 
  Presently, 16 UN agencies have a mandate that allows them to work in emergency 
  situations. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) 
  is supposed to coordinate efforts in disaster relief. The International Committee 
  of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
  Societies (IFRC-RCS) have a basis in international law. M&eacute;decins sans 
  Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) and OXFAM are examples of internationally operating 
  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), of which there are hundreds. In addition, 
  all types of local NGOs may be involved in the relief work, along with the national 
  government and local authorities. In a typical disaster situation, one has to 
  cope with a multitude of different agencies (Frerks <i>et al</i>., 1999). Donor 
  governments and agencies as well as international organizations provide the 
  funds; substantial amounts may be raised directly from the public at large.</p>
<p>The large amount of relief amount for cyclones in 1998 was largely a result 
  of Hurricane Mitch, which struck Central America in that year. In the same year, 
  Bangladesh and China were struck by very large flood disasters. The foregoing 
  numbers show that on an annual basis, international relief is in hundreds of 
  millions of dollars. This is a small number compared with total global damage 
  from natural disasters (tens of billions of dollars).</p>
