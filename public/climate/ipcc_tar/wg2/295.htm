<h3>6.4.5. Tropical Reef Coasts</h3>
<p>Coral reefs occur in a variety of fringing, barrier, and atoll settings throughout 
  the tropical and subtropical world. Coral reefs constitute important and productive 
  sources of biodiversity; they harbor more than 25% of all known marine fish 
  (Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 1998), as well as a total species diversity containing more 
  phyla than rainforests (Sale, 1999). Reefs also represent a significant source 
  of food for many coastal communities (Wilkinson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Coral reefs serve 
  important functions as atoll island foundations, coastal protection structures, 
  and sources of beach sand; they have economic value for tourism (which is increasingly 
  important for many national economies) and support emerging opportunities in 
  biotechnology. Moberg and Folke (1999) have published a comprehensive list of 
  goods and ecological services provided by coral reef ecosystems.</p>
<p>The total areal extent of living coral reefs has been estimated at about 255,000 
  km<sup>2</sup> (Spalding and Grenfell, 1997). As much as 58% (rising locally to &gt;80% 
  in southeast Asia) are considered at risk from human activities, such as industrial 
  development and pollution, tourism and urbanization, agricultural runoff, sewage 
  pollution, increased sedimentation, overfishing, coral mining, and land reclamation 
  (Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 1998), as well as predation and disease (e.g., Antonius, 1995; 
  Richardson <i>et al.</i>, 1998). In the past these local factors, together with episodic 
  natural events such as storms, were regarded as the primary cause of degradation 
  of coral reefs. Now, Brown (1997), Hoegh-Guldberg (1999), and Wilkinson (1999), 
  for instance, invoke global factors, including global climate change, as a cause 
  of coral reef degradation. </p>
<p>Previous IPCC assessments have concluded that the threat of sea-level rise 
  to coral reefs (as opposed to reef islands) is minor (Bijlsma <i>et al.</i>, 1996; 
  Nurse <i>et al.</i>, 1998). This conclusion is based on projected rates of global sea-level 
  rise from Warrick <i>et al.</i> (1996) on the order of 2-9 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over the next 
  100 years. Reef accretion at these rates has not been widely documented, largely 
  because most reefs have been growing horizontally under stable or falling sea 
  levels in recent years (Wilkinson and Buddemeier, 1994). Schlager (1999) reports 
  an approximate upper limit of vertical reef growth during the Holocene of 10 
  mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that healthy reef flats are able to keep pace with projected 
  sea-level rise. The situation is less clear for the large numbers of degraded 
  reefs in densely populated regions of south and southeast Asia, eastern Africa, 
  and the Caribbean (Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 1998), as well as those close to population 
  centers in the Pacific (Zann, 1994).</p>
<p>Positive trends of SST have been recorded in much of the tropical ocean over 
  the past several decades, and SST is projected to rise by 1-2&deg;C by 
  2100. Many coral reefs occur at or close to temperature tolerance thresholds 
  (Goreau, 1992; Hanaki <i>et al.</i>, 1998), and Brown (1997) has argued that steadily 
  rising SST will create progressively more hostile conditions for many reefs. 
  This effect, along with decreased CaCO3 saturation state (as CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise), 
  represent two of the most serious threats to reefs in the 21st century (Hoegh-Guldberg, 
  1999; Kleypas <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Several authors regard an increase in coral bleaching as a likely result of 
  global warming. However, Kushmaro <i>et al.</i> (1998) cite references that indicate 
  it is not yet possible to determine conclusively that bleaching episodes and 
  the consequent damage to reefs are caused by global climate change. Corals bleach 
  (i.e., pale in color) because of physiological shock in response to abrupt changes 
  in temperature, salinity, and turbidity. This paling represents a loss of symbiotic 
  algae, which make essential contributions to coral nutrition and clarification. 
  Bleaching often may be temporary, with corals regaining color once stressful 
  environmental conditions ameliorate. Brown <i>et al.</i> (2000) indicate that some 
  corals in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Caribbean Sea are known to bleach 
  on an annual basis in response to seasonal variations in temperature and irradiance. 
  Major bleaching events can occur when SSTs exceed seasonal maximums by &gt;1&deg;C 
  (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Mortality for small excursions of temperature is variable 
  and, in some cases, apparently depth-related (Phongsuwan, 1998); surviving coral 
  has reduced growth and reproductive capacity. More extensive mortality accompanies 
  temperature anomalies of 3&deg;C or more over several months (Brown and Suharsono, 
  1990). Hoegh-Guldberg (1999) found that major episodes of coral bleaching over 
  the past 20 years were associated with major El Ni&ntilde;o events, when seasonal 
  maximum temperatures were exceeded by at least 1&deg;C.</p>
<p>Corals weakened by other stresses may be more susceptible to bleaching (Glynn, 
  1996; Brown, 1997), although Goreau (1992) found in Jamaica that anthropogenically 
  stressed areas had lower bleaching frequencies. More frequent and extensive 
  bleaching decreases live coral cover, leading to reduced species diversity (Goreau, 
  1992; Edinger <i>et al.</i>, 1998) and greater susceptibility to other threats (e.g., 
  pathogens and emergent diseases as addressed by Kushmaro <i>et al.</i>, 1996, 1998; 
  Aronson <i>et al.</i>, 2000). In the short term, this bleaching may set back reef communities 
  to early successional stages characterized by noncalcifying benthos such as 
  algae, soft corals, and sponges (Done, 1999). Reefs affected by coral bleaching 
  may become dominated by physically resilient hemispherical corals because branching 
  corals are more susceptible to elevated SST, leading to a decrease in coral 
  and habitat diversity (Brown and Suharsono, 1990). Differential susceptibility 
  to bleaching among coral taxa has been reported during the large-scale event 
  in 1998 on the Great Barrier Reef (Marshall and Baird, 2000). </p>
<p>The 1998 bleaching event was unprecedented in severity over large areas of 
  the world, especially the Indian Ocean. This event is interpreted by Wilkinson 
  <i>et al.</i> (1999) as ENSO-related and could provide a valuable indicator of the 
  potential effects of global climate change. However, the 1998 intense warming 
  in the western Indian Ocean has been associated with shifts in the Indian dipole 
  rather than ENSO. </p>
<p>Attempts to predict bleaching have met with variable success. Winter <i>et al.</i> 
  (1998) compared a 30-year record of SST at La Parguera, Puerto Rico, with coral 
  bleaching events at the same location but could not forecast coral bleaching 
  frequency from the temperature record. On the other hand, analyses of recent 
  sea temperature anomalies, based on satellite data, have been used to predict 
  the mass coral bleaching extent during 1997-1998 (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999).</p>
<p>Recently it has been suggested that a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> levels could reduce reef 
  calcification, but this effect is very difficult to predict (Gattuso <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). Kleypas <i>et al.</i> (1999) argue that such effects could be noticed by 2100 
  because of the decreased availability of CaCO<sub>3</sub> to corals. In combination with 
  potentially more frequent bleaching episodes, reduced calcification could impede 
  a reef's ability to grow vertically in pace with sea-level rise.</p>
<p>The implications for reef-bound coasts in terms of sediment supply, shore protection, 
  and living resources may be complex, either positive or negative, and are difficult 
  to predict at a global scale. However, there have been suggestions that fishing 
  yields will be reduced as reef viability decreases, leading to reduced yields 
  of protein for dependent human populations, and that the effects of reducing 
  the productivity of reef ecosystems on birds and marine mammals are expected 
  to be substantial (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). </p>
