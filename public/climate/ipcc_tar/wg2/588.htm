<p>Potential land-use impacts and adaptation responses also were considered. One 
  issue was whether the region could take advantage of a longer growing season 
  to expand wheat production. Results showed that this was possible (given the 
  constraints of the model), but only if expanded irrigation services would be 
  made available (Brklacich <i>et al</i>., 1997a). The side effects of this are unknown. 
  The second case was a forestry study that showed that commercial yields of softwood 
  lumber would decline because of changing growth potential for these species, 
  combined with increased fire frequency. This would offset improvements for hardwood 
  species (Hartley and Marshall, 1997; Rothman and Herbert, 1997). Integrated 
  modeling exercises, using these sectoral outputs, indicated that agriculture 
  production would be able to achieve its goals, but there would be shortfalls 
  in softwood (spruce) production and a substantial increase in erosion (Yin and 
  Cohen, 1994; Huang <i>et al</i>., 1998; Yin <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Stakeholders were asked to react to the various research results through thematic 
  roundtable discussions. One of these themes was infrastructure maintenance. 
  Engineers suggested that physical infrastructure&#151;such as roads, airstrips, 
  and pipelines&#151;could be repaired or designed differently to meet changing 
  climatic conditions, but there certainly would be increased costs in doing so. 
  It also was suggested that the notion of infrastructure should include education 
  and insurance mechanisms, emergency response, and social and cultural institutions 
  that pool risk and support people in times of stress (Zdan, 1997). Changes in 
  community development already have influenced emergency response to floods and 
  could affect adaptation to future climate changes (Newton, 1995, 1997).</p>
<p>In another thematic context&#151;ecosystem sustainability&#151;it is unclear 
  whether current institutions in the region would be capable of coping with a 
  scenario of simultaneous changes in renewable resources and dependent communities, 
  superimposed on other nonclimate stresses affecting the region. During the past 
  few years in northern Canada, co-management processes have been developing for 
  aboriginal and non-aboriginal (and government) stakeholders concerned with wildlife 
  and water resources. This has been part of a larger trend of devolution of responsibility 
  from central to regional authorities in Canada&#151;a trend that is taking place 
  for reasons other than climate change. Regional stakeholders regard these processes 
  as their best approach to coping with climate change, although it was noted 
  that climate change would be a new experience for everyone (Irlbacher, 1997).</p>
<p>Climate change joins a long list of factors that affect the lifestyles and 
  livelihoods of people who live in the north. With or without climate change, 
  however, native lifestyles are in flux, and any potential impacts should be 
  considered in that context. Communities already are being affected by changes 
  in wildlife harvesting opportunities and wage-based employment. Education and 
  transportation have improved, and some native people are opting for jobs in 
  the wage economy. As the "two economies" continue to evolve, communities 
  will be trying to provide opportunities in traditional and wage-based activities, 
  but if climate change affects wildlife numbers or habitats, traditional patterns 
  of wildlife harvesting would have to be modified.</p>
<p>Native people have adapted to change, but the predictability of the extent, 
  duration, and speed made such adaptation possible. There is real concern that 
  if future changes were to be fast, dramatic, and surprising, native communities 
  would be left in a very vulnerable position. Traditional lifestyles would be 
  at risk of disappearing.</p>
<p>Stakeholders have proposed that monitoring and adaptation could be undertaken 
  through more effective partnerships between governments and native communities. 
  Traditional knowledge, along with western science, should be used in modern 
  management practices as well as in traditional activities. Training in renewable 
  resource management for aboriginal youth would be an important component of 
  preparing for the future (Pinter, 1997).</p>
