      <b>Figure SPM-2:</b> Reasons for concern about projected climate change 
      impacts. The risks of adverse impacts from climate change increase with 
      the magnitude of climate change. The left part of the figure displays the 
      observed temperature increase relative to 1990 and the range of projected 
      temperature increase after 1990 as estimated by Working Group I of the IPCC 
      for scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. The right 
      panel displays conceptualizations of five reasons for concern regarding 
      climate change risks evolving through 2100. White indicates neutral or small 
      negative or positive impacts or risks, yellow indicates negative impacts 
      for some systems or low risks, and red means negative impacts or risks that 
      are more widespread and/or greater in magnitude. The assessment of impacts 
      or risks takes into account only the magnitude of change and not the rate 
      of change. Global mean annual temperature change is used in the figure as 
      a proxy for the magnitude of climate change, but projected impacts will 
      be a function of, among other factors, the magnitude and rate of global 
      and regional changes in mean climate, climate variability and extreme climate 
      phenomena, social and economic conditions, and adaptation. </td>

<p><a name="figspm2"></a>Natural systems can be especially vulnerable to climate 
  change because of limited adaptive capacity (see <a href="#boxspm1">Box SPM-1</a>), 
  and some of these systems may undergo significant and irreversible damage. Natural 
  systems at risk include glaciers, coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal 
  and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie wetlands, and remnant 
  native grasslands. While some species may increase in abundance or range, climate 
  change will increase existing risks of extinction of some more vulnerable species 
  and loss of biodiversity. It is well-established6 that the geographical extent 
  of the damage or loss, and the number of systems affected, will increase with 
  the magnitude and rate of climate change (see <a href="#figspm2">Figure SPM-2</a>).

  other financial services; and human health. The vulnerability of these systems 
  varies with geographic location, time, and social, economic, and environmental

        Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity, and Vulnerability</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely 
        or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli. Climate-related stimuli encompass 
        all the elements of climate change, including mean climate characteristics, 
        climate variability, and the frequency and magnitude of extremes. The 
        effect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a change 
        in the mean, range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., 
        damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due 
        to sea-level rise).</p>
      <p>Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to adjust to climate change 
        (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, 
        to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable 
        to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability 
        and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, 
        and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, 
        its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity. </p>

<h2><a name="25"></a>2.5. Projected Changes in Climate Extremes could have Major 
  Consequences</h2>
<p>The vulnerability of human societies and natural systems to climate extremes 
  is demonstrated by the damage, hardship, and death caused by events such as 
  droughts, floods, heat waves, avalanches, and windstorms. While there are uncertainties 
  attached to estimates of such changes, some extreme events are projected to 
  increase in frequency and/or severity during the 21st century due to changes 
  in the mean and/or variability of climate, so it can be expected that the severity 
  of their impacts will also increase in concert with global warming (see <a href="#figspm2">Figure 
  SPM-2</a>). Conversely, the frequency and magnitude of extreme low temperature 
  events, such as cold spells, is projected to decrease in the future, with both 
  positive and negative impacts. The impacts of future changes in climate extremes 
  are expected to fall disproportionately on the poor. Some representative examples 
  of impacts of these projected changes in climate variability and climate extremes 
  are presented in <a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table SPM-1</a>. [<a href="029.htm">3.5</a>, 
  <a href="036.htm">4.6</a>, <a href="049.htm">6</a>, and <a href="052.htm">7.2.4</a>]</p>
