<h2>5.10. Research Needs across Ecosystems</h2>
<p>Most of the foregoing sections mention the need for further research in many 
  areas. Results are needed for future assessments of the impacts of climate change 
  on goods and services provided by ecosystems, adaptation options, or identification 
  of vulnerable systems or regions. It also is clear that most of the research 
  to date has focused on impacts and some on adaptation, with little effort on 
  the vulnerability of systems or regions. Key areas where research is needed 
  to improve future assessments and decrease uncertainties in existing knowledge 
  are as follows (order does not imply priority):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Long-term monitoring of agricultural processes for detection of impacts 
    of climate change and climate variability and development of possible adaptations 
    to these impacts<br>
  </li>
  <li>Coupling of pest and crop/animal process modeling to estimate climate-induced 
    pest impacts on crops and livestock<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pest and disease interaction with climate change and the impact of these 
    interactions on many ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of coupled biophysical-economic modeling of farm-level decisionmaking 
    under climate change<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved understanding of agricultural vulnerability and adaptive capacity<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved understanding of interactive effects of climate change and management 
    on carbon source-sink relations in many ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>Determination of mechanisms that create the often complex changes in wildlife 
    populations, through a systems-type approach to problemsolving such as strategic 
    cyclical scaling (SCS)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a><br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of better understanding of the link between biodiversity and 
    ecosystems functions (role each species plays in ecosystem goods and services 
    is necessary to understand the risks and possible surprises associated with 
    species loss)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The impact of land-use change on biodiversity and the consequence of these 
    impacts on good and services from ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>The impact of the added stress of climate change on many ecosystems that 
    are under pressure from human activities<br>
  </li>
  <li>Exploration of management options (including individual species range) that 
    could be used to adapt to the impacts of global change (allowing ecosystems 
    to continue to provide essential goods and services in a changed and rapidly 
    changing world)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Exploration of the role of integrated management as a means for providing 
    better management options for many ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>Long-term experiments on intact natural ecosystems across their native range 
    to study the interactive effect of climate change, elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, 
    nutrient/pollution deposition, soil moisture, and WUE of plants<br>
  </li>
  <li>The interaction of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, increased temperature, and changes 
    in soil moisture with nitrogen deposition and land-use change in influencing 
    the goods and services provided by ecosystems<br>
  </li>
  <li>Valuation of nonmarket goods and services, such as recreation and NWFP<br>
  </li>
  <li>Management of exotics and achieving desired community structures (research 
    and alternative models for such activities needed in terrestrial and aquatic 
    systems)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of a predictive approach for identifying and dealing with spatial 
    heterogeneity, since responses to climate change differ greatly in adjacent 
    areas (increasing the risk of inappropriate actions with large expenditures 
    of local resources)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of systems models for peatlands, including analysis and modeling 
    of the dynamic interactions between climate change impacts, vegetation development, 
    and carbon exchange between wetland ecosystems and the atmosphere at several 
    spatial scales (from stands to regions to the globe)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The role of fire and other disturbances on many ecosystems and their role 
    in trace-gas budgets<br>
  </li>
  <li>Time lags by which productivity, decomposition, and disturbance in ecosystems 
    respond to climatic change<br>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of the vulnerability of unique biological resources that are 
    culturally important to many indigenous peoples.</li>
</ul>
