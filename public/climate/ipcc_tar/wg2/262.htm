<h4>5.7.3.3. Biogeochemical Cycling and Pollution </h4>
<p>Understanding of interactions of climate change with other human-caused pressures 
  on lakes and streams is still in its infancy. No simulation models have been 
  developed to assess the combined effects of these pressures on these systems.

      Figure 5-8:</b> Diagram of complex interactions between climate change, 
      watershed and lake processes, and water clarity of a eutrophic lake [modified 
      from Lathrop (1998) and information in Lathrop et al. (1999)]. The left 
      panel diagrams a warmer, dryer climate with less wind; the right panel diagrams 
      a warmer, windier, and wetter climate with more extreme rain events. In 
      both cases, the altered climate would be expected to change the water quality 
      of the lake, but the complexity of relations leads to uncertain future water 
      clarities. A "+" means an increase and a "-" means a 
      decrease in the condition or process; a "?" means conflicting 
      expectations. Greater blooms of phytoplankton lead to lower water clarity, 
      and reduced blooms lead to greater clarity. Blooms depend on external and 
      internal loading of phosphorus (P). Dryer climates lead to less external 
      loading, whereas wetter climates or more episodic rains lead to more external 
      loading. Warmer climates lead to warmer surface waters and increased vertical 
      stability in the water column, thus less mixing and internal loading. Warmer 
      waters also allow potential invasion by warmer loving, zooplaktivorous fish 
      that can reduce zooplankton species that in turn reduce algal populations. 
      Windier climates result in increased vertical mixing, thus greater internal 
      loading.</td>

<p><a name="fig58"></a>Nutrient cycling would be altered by climate change in 
  ways that could exacerbate existing water quality problems such as eutrophication 
  (see <a href="#fig58">Figure 5-8</a>). Eutrophication of lakes results when 
  nutrient inputs from catchments and recycling from bottom sediments are large. 
  The result is excessive production of algae; blue-green algae reduce water quality 
  for recreation and drinking. Deep coldwater habitats become anoxic, owing to 
  greater rates of decomposition of sinking organic mater (Horne and Goldman, 
  1994). </p>
<p>Interaction between climate change and eutrophication is complex, and projections 
  are somewhat contradictory (see <a href="#fig58">Figure 5-8</a>) because climate-influenced 
  processes have interacting and often opposing effects (Magnuson et al., 1997; 
  Schindler, 1997). Consider, for example, phosphate release from anoxic sediments. 
  In a warmer climate, the longer period of summer stratification would increase 
  the likelihood that anoxia develops below the thermocline (Stefan and Fang, 
  1993); this would increase the solubility of phosphates in sediment and increase 
  nutrient recycling. At the same time, warmer climates would reduce the duration 
  of ice cover in lakes, which would reduce winter anoxia and decrease sediment 
  phosphate release in winter. This is further complicated by water column stability.</p>
<p>In Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (Lathrop et al., 1999), it is not surprising that 
  one-third of observed year-to-year variation in summer water clarity is associated 
  with variability in runoff (see <a href="#fig58">Figure 5-8</a>); more nutrient 
  input leads to higher populations of phytoplankton, which reduce water clarity. 
  Runoff would be influenced by differences in precipitation and the frequency 
  of extreme rainfall events during autumn, winter, and spring. Precipitation 
  trends differ around the world, and there is evidence for increased frequency 
  of extreme rainfall events that may occur in different seasons of the year (see 
  <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Wetter climates or climates with more extreme 
  rainfall events would increase export of nutrients and sediment to lakes and 
  streams; dryer climates or those with more even rainfall would reduce export 
  to lakes and streams. Extreme rainfall events would export more if they occurred 
  at seasons when the earth was bare in agricultural watersheds. </p>
<p>In Lake Mendota, the other two-thirds of the variation in water clarity also 
  is related to climate (see <a href="#fig58">Figure 5-8</a>). One-third is through 
  climatic influences on vertical mixing, where warmer summers lead to greater 
  water column stability, less recycling from deep water, and greater water clarity. 
  The remaining one-third is related to the abundance of herbivorous zooplankton 
  that eat phytoplankton. A warming climate would allow invasion of new species 
  of fish that forage on the herbivorous zooplankton; in Lake Mendota, it probably 
  would be the gizzard shad that lives in reservoirs south of Wisconsin (see Dettmers 
  and Stein, 1996).</p>
<p>Several other complexities would lead to different results, depending on the 
  change in precipitation patterns. For example, in a dryer climate, increases 
  in water residence time (Schindler et al., 1996a) would increase the importance 
  of nutrient recycling within lakes, and storage of nutrients in the sediments 
  of lakes would be reduced (Hauer et al., 1997). This is complicated by changes 
  in light penetration that occur if dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs are 
  reduced (Magnuson et al., 1997; Schindler, 1997). DOC can reduce light penetration, 
  so a reduction in DOC input would increase light availability and could lead 
  to increases in primary production in deeper water. This influence would depend 
  on whether climate becomes dryer or wetter.</p>
<p>Several empirical and simulation studies support the idea of increased eutrophication 
  with climate change. Results of these studies contradict the expectations of 
  reductions in nutrient loading from catchments in drier climates and greater 
  stability of the water column in warmer climates.</p>
<p>Empirical relations (Regier et al., 1990; Lin and Regier, 1995) suggest that 
  annual primary production by phytoplankton, zooplankton biomass, and sustained 
  yields of fisheries all increase with temperature. Simulations for Lake Erie 
  (Blumberg and Di Toro, 1990) and smaller lakes (Stefan and Fang, 1993) indicate 
  that climate change leads to more eutrophic conditions with respect to loss 
  of oxygen beneath the thermocline in summer. Ogutu-Ohwayo et al. (1997) suggest 
  that recent changes in the regional climate of Lake Victoria in Africa may have 
  reduced physical mixing and contributed to increases in deepwater anoxia and 
  thus nutrient recycling contributing to eutrophication.</p>
