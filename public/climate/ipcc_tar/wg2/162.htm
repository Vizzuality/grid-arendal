<h1><a name="42"></a>4.2. State of Knowledge of Climate Change Impacts on Hydrology 
  and Water Resources: Progress since the Second Assessment Report</h1>
<h3><a name="421"></a>4.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Over the past decade&#151;and increasingly since the publication of the Second 
  Assessment Report (SAR) (Arnell et al., 1996; Kaczmarek, 1996)&#151;there have 
  been many studies into climate change effects on hydrology and water resources 
  (see the online bibliography described by Chalecki and Gleick, 1999), some coordinated 
  into national programs of research (as in the U.S. National Assessment) and 
  some undertaken on behalf of water management agencies. There are still many 
  gaps and unknowns, however. The bulk of this chapter assesses current understanding 
  of the impacts of climate change on water resources and implications for adaptation. 
  This section highlights significant developments in three key areas since the 
  SAR: methodological advances, increasing recognition of the effect of climate 
  variability, and early attempts at adaptation to climate change.</p>
<h3><a name="422"></a>4.2.2 Estimating the Impacts of Climate Change</h3>
<p>The impacts of climate change on hydrology usually are estimated by defining 
  scenarios for changes in climatic inputs to a hydrological model from the output 
  of general circulation models (GCMs). The three key developments here are constructing 
  scenarios that are suitable for hydrological impact assessments, developing 
  and using realistic hydrological models, and understanding better the linkages 
  and feedbacks between climate and hydrological systems.</p>
<p>The heart of the scenario &#147;problem&#148; lies in the scale mismatch between 
  global climate models (data generally provided on a monthly time step at a spatial 
  resolution of several tens of thousands of square kilometers) and catchment 
  hydrological models (which require data on at least daily scales and at a resolution 
  of perhaps a few square kilometers). A variety of &#147;downscaling&#148; techniques 
  have been developed (Wilby and Wigley, 1997) and used in hydrological studies. 
  These techniques range from simple interpolation of climate model output (as 
  used in the U.S. National Assessment; Felzer and Heard, 1999), through the use 
  of empirical/statistical relationships between catchment and regional climate 
  (e.g., Crane and Hewitson, 1998; Wilby et al., 1998, 1999), to the use of nested 
  regional climate models (e.g., Christensen and Christensen, 1998); all, however, 
  depend on the quality of simulation of the driving global model, and the relative 
  costs and benefits of each approach have yet to be ascertained. Studies also 
  have looked at techniques for generating stochastically climate data at the 
  catchment scale (Wilby et al., 1998, 1999). In principle, it is possible to 
  explore the effects of changing temporal patterns with stochastic climate data, 
  but in practice the credibility of such assessments will be strongly influenced 
  by the ability of the stochastic model to simulate present temporal patterns 
  realistically.</p>
<p>Considerable effort has been expended on developing improved hydrological models 
  for estimating the effects of climate change. Improved models have been developed 
  to simulate water quantity and quality, with a focus on realistic representation 
  of the physical processes involved. These models often have been developed to 
  be of general applicability, with no locally calibrated parameters, and are 
  increasingly using remotely sensed data as input. Although different hydrological 
  models can give different values of streamflow for a given input (as shown, 
  for example, by Boorman and Sefton, 1997; Arnell, 1999a), the greatest uncertainties 
  in the effects of climate on streamflow arise from uncertainties in climate 
  change scenarios, as long as a conceptually sound hydrological model is used. 
  In estimating impacts on groundwater recharge, water quality, or flooding, however, 
  translation of climate into response is less well understood, and additional 
  uncertainty is introduced. In this area, there have been some reductions in 
  uncertainty since the SAR as models have been improved and more studies conducted 
  (see <a href="171.htm">Sections 4.3.8 </a>and <a href="173.htm">4.3.10</a>). 
  The actual impacts on water resources&#151;such as water supply, power generation, 
  navigation, and so forth&#151;depend not only on the estimated hydrological 
  change but also on changes in demand for the resource and assumed responses 
  of water resources managers. Since the SAR, there have been a few studies that 
  have summarized potential response strategies and assessed how water managers 
  might respond in practice (see <a href="186.htm">Section 4.6</a>).<br>
  <br>
  There also have been considerable advances since the SAR in the understanding 
  of relationships between hydrological processes at the land surface and processes 
  within the atmosphere above. These advances have come about largely through 
  major field measurement and modeling projects in different geographical environments 
  [including the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE), LAMBADA, HAPEX-Sahel, and 
  NOPEX; see www.gewex.com], coordinated research programs (such as those through 
  the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP; see www.igbp.se) and 
  large-scale coupled hydrology-climate modeling projects [including GEWEX Continental-Scale 
  International Project (GCIP), Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX), and GEWEX Asian 
  Monsoon Experiment (GAME); see www.gewex.com/projects.html]. The ultimate aim 
  of such studies often is to lead to improved assessments of the hydrological 
  effects of climate change through the use of coupled climate-hydrology models; 
  thus far, however, the benefits to impact assessments have been indirect, through 
  improvements to the parameterizations of climate models. A few studies have 
  used coupled climate-hydrology models to forecast streamflow (e.g., Miller and 
  Kim, 1996), and some have begun to use them to estimate effects of changing 
  climate on streamflow (e.g., Miller and Kim, 2000).</p>
