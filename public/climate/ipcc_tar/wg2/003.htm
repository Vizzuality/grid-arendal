<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established 
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment 
  Programme (UNEP) in 1988. Its terms of reference includes: (i) to assess available 
  scientific and socioeconomic information on climate change and its impacts and 
  on the options for mitigating climate change and adapting to it, and (ii) to 
  provide, on request, scientific/technical/socioeconomic advice to the Conference 
  of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC). From 1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports, Special 
  Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and other products that have become 
  standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists, and other 
  experts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This volume, which forms part of the Third Assessment Report (TAR), has been 
  produced by Working Group II (WGII) of the IPCC and focuses on the environmental, 
  social, and economic consequences of climate change and potential adaptation 
  responses. It consists of 19 chapters covering the sensitivity, adaptive capacity, 
  and vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change, and the potential 
  impacts and adaptation options at regional and global scales. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended first 
  and foremost on the knowledge, enthusiasm, and cooperation of many hundreds 
  of experts worldwide, in many related but different disciplines. We would like 
  to express our gratitude to all the Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors, 
  Contributing Authors, Review Editors, and Expert Reviewers. These individuals 
  have devoted enormous time and effort to produce this report and we are extremely 
  grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process. We would like to thank the 
  staff of the WGII Technical Support Unit and the IPCC Secretariat for their 
  dedication in coordinating the production of another successful IPCC report. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are also grateful to the governments that have supported their scientists' 
  participation in the IPCC process and that have contributed to the IPCC Trust 
  Fund to provide for the essential participation of experts from developing countries 
  and countries with economies in transition. We would like to express our appreciation 
  to the governments of Australia, Japan, Malta, Morocco, Peru, Portugal, South 
  Africa, Switzerland, and the United States that hosted drafting sessions in 
  their countries, to the government of Switzerland that hosted the Sixth Session 
  of Working Group II in Geneva, and to the government of the United States that 
  funded the WGII Technical Support Unit.<br>
</p>
<p>We would particularly like to thank Dr. Robert Watson, Chairman of the IPCC, 
  for his sound direction and tireless and able guidance of the IPCC, and Prof. 
  James McCarthy and Dr. Osvaldo Canziani, the Co-Chairmen of Working Group II, 
  for their skillful leadership of Working Group II through the production of 
  this report.</p>
