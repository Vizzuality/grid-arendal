<h2>7.4. Infrastructure </h2>
<h3><a name="741"></a>7.4.1. Water Supply and Demand </h3>
<p>Increases in average atmospheric temperature accelerate the rate of evaporation 
  and demand for cooling water in human settlements, thereby increasing overall 
  water demand, while simultaneously either increasing or decreasing water supplies 
  (depending on whether precipitation increases or decreases and whether additional 
  supply, if any, can be captured or simply runs off and is lost). Shimizu (1993, 
  quoted in Mimura et al., 1998) showed that daily water demand in Nagoya, Japan, 
  would increase by 10% as the highest daily temperature rose from 25 to 30°C. 
  Boland (1997) looked at several climate transient forecasts for the Washington, 
  DC, metropolitan area for the year 2030 and estimated increases in summertime 
  use of 13 to 19% and annual use of -8 to +11% relative to a future increase 
  from 1990 without climate change of approximately 100%. In China, using four 
  GCMs for the year 2030, water deficiency under normal (50%) and extreme dry 
  (95%) hydrological conditions for various basins was predicted as -1.6 x 10<sup>8</sup> 
  to 1.43 x 10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup> in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area 
  and -1.1 x 10<sup>8</sup> to 121.2 x 10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup> in the Yellow 
  River Basin (China Country Study Team, 1999). </p>
<p>Estimates of effects on water supply mostly have dealt with linking atmospheric 
  and hydrologic models in an attempt to produce more plausible forecasts with 
  statistical variability. Although they do not directly forecast water supplies 
  to human settlements, Kwadijk and Rotmans (1995) do show an increase in variability 
  of supply in the Rhine River with climate change, but little change in estimated 
  annual flow. The study is unusual in that it attempts to directly link impacts 
  to mitigation policy. A more conventional study that still links water supply 
  (directly for a municipal water system) and climate scenarios is Wood et al. 
  (1997). </p>
<h3> <a name="742"></a>7.4.2. Buildings, Transportation, and Other Infrastructure 
</h3>
<p>Additional research since the SAR seems to have added to concerns about increased 
  intensity of rainfall and urban flooding (e.g., for the highly urbanized northeast 
  United States-Rosensenzweig and Solecki, 2000). Increases in intensity are projected 
  by Fowler and Hennessy (1995) and Hennessy et al. (1997). Smith et al. (1999) 
  have performed a series of four case studies that combine climate and hydrological 
  modeling to directly model flood frequency and magnitude and economic losses 
  under enhanced greenhouse rainfall intensities. The study concludes that there 
  would be little change in forecast flood damage by the year 2030 but that there 
  would be substantial increase in flood risk (shortened average return interval) 
  and flood damage (as a result of building inundation and failure) by the year 
  2070. The estimation technique was an improvement over earlier studies that 
  assumed that changes in intensities of rainfall events would be associated with 
  changes in flood frequency (e.g., Minnery and Smith, 1996). </p>
<p>Generally speaking, climate change will change the level and type of climatic 
  effects that need to be covered by infrastructure design codes. This could affect 
  infrastructure durability and energy usage. Potential changes in humidity and 
  climate may change distribution in factors such as termites, for example-with 
  potential degradation of structures and more serious impacts from given extreme 
  events. There also could be adverse effects of storms, heat, and humidity on 
  walls and insulation, though perhaps less winter damage. </p>
<h3><a name="743"></a>7.4.3. Estimating and Valuing Infrastructure Effects </h3>
<p>There still are relatively few reports that estimate the impact of global warming 
  on the value of economic losses resulting from effects on infrastructure. However, 
  Smith et al. (1999) and Penning-Powswell et al. (1996) provide estimates that 
  show that increases in damages from urban riverine flooding probably would be 
  substantial. See also the discussion on sea-level rise in <a href="310.htm#7222">Section 
  7.2.2.2</a>.</p>
