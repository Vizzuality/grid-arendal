<h3>12.4.7. Coastal and Marine Systems </h3>
<p>Australia has some of the finest examples of coral reefs in the world, stretching 
  for thousands of kilometers along the northwest and northeast coasts (Ellison, 
  1996). Coral reefs in the Australian region are subject to greenhouse-related 
  stresses (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a> for a summary), including increasingly 
  frequent bleaching episodes, changes in sea level, and probable decreases in 
  calcification rates as a result of changes in ocean chemistry. </p>
<p>Mass bleaching has occurred on several occasions in Australia's Great 
  Barrier Reef (GBR) and elsewhere since the 1970s (Glynn, 1993; Hoegh-Guldberg 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Jones <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Wilkinson, 1998). Particularly 
  widespread bleaching, leading to death of some corals, occurred globally in 
  1997-1998 in association with a major El Ni&ntilde;o event. Bleaching was 
  severe on the inner GBR but less severe on the outer reef (Wilkinson, 1998; 
  Berkelmans and Oliver, 1999). This episode was associated with generally record-high 
  SSTs over most of the GBR region. This was a result of global warming trends 
  resulting from the enhanced greenhouse effect and regional summer warming from 
  the El Ni&ntilde;o event, the combined effects of which caused SSTs to exceed 
  bleaching thresholds (Lough, 1999). Three independent databases support the 
  view that 1997-1998 SST anomalies were the most extreme in the past 95 
  years and that average SSTs off the northeast coast of Australia have significantly 
  increased from 1903 to 1994. Lowered seawater salinity as a result of flooding 
  of major rivers between Ayr and Cooktown early in 1998 also is believed to have 
  been a major factor in exacerbating the effects in the inshore GBR (Berkelmans 
  and Oliver, 1999). Solar radiation, which is affected by changes in cloud cover 
  and thus by El Ni&ntilde;o, also may have been a factor (Brown, 1997; Berkelmans 
  and Oliver, 1999).</p>
<p>Although warming in Australia's coral reef regions on average is expected 
  to be slightly less than the global average, according to the SRES global warming 
  scenarios it may be in the range of 2-5&deg;C by 2100. This suggests that 
  unless Australian coral reefs can adapt quickly to these higher temperatures, 
  they will experience temperatures above present bleaching thresholds (Berkelmans 
  and Willis, 1999) almost every year, well before the end of the 21st century 
  (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Hoegh-Guldberg (1999) notes that apparent thresholds 
  for coral bleaching are higher in the northern GBR than further south, suggesting 
  that some very long-term adaptation has occurred. Coral reef biota may be able 
  to adapt, at least initially, by selection for the more heat-tolerant host and 
  symbiont species and genotypes that survived the 1997-1998 summer and by 
  colonization of damaged sites by more heat-resistant genotypes from higher latitudes 
  arriving as planktonic larvae. However, it is generally believed that the rate 
  and extent of adaptation will be much slower than would be necessary for reef 
  biota to resist the frequency and severity of high SST anomalies projected for 
  the middle third of the 21st century (medium to high confidence). The most likely 
  outlook is that mass bleaching, leading to death of corals, will become a more 
  frequent event on Australian coral reefs in coming decades.</p>
<p>Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will decrease the carbonate 
  concentration of the ocean, thereby reducing calcification rates of corals (Gattuso 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998, 1999; Kleypas <i>et al.</i>, 1999). This is complicated, 
  however, by the effects of possible changes in light levels, freshwater discharge, 
  current patterns, and temperature. For example, Lough and Barnes (2000) report 
  a historic growth stimulus for the <i>Porites</i> coral that they correlate 
  with increasing average SSTs. Thus, the net effect on Australian reefs up to 
  1980 appears to have been positive, but it is unclear whether decreased carbonate 
  concentration resulting from rapidly increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  will outweigh the direct temperature effect later in the 21st century, especially 
  if regional SSTs reach levels not experienced by the corals of the GBR during 
  the Holocene.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>, expected rates of sea-level rise 
  to 2100 would not threaten healthy coral reefs (most Australian reefs) but could 
  invigorate growth on reef flats. However, decreased calcification rates might 
  reduce the potential ability of the reefs to keep up with rapid sea-level rise. 
  Possible increases in tropical cyclone intensity with global warming also would 
  impact coral reefs (high confidence), along with nonclimatic factors such as 
  overexploitation and increasing pollution and turbidity of coastal waters by 
  sediment loading, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides (Larcombe <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). Climate change could affect riverine runoff and associated stresses of 
  the reefs, including low-salinity episodes. Coupled with predicted rises in 
  sea level and storminess, bleaching-induced coral death also could weaken the 
  effectiveness of the reefs in protecting the Queensland coast and adversely 
  affect the biodiversity of the reef complex.</p>
<p>On the whole, mangrove processes are less understood than those for coral reefs 
  (Ellison, 1996). Mangroves occur on low-energy, sedimentary shorelines, generally 
  between mean- and high-tide levels. Australian mangroves cover approximately 
  11,500 km<sup>2</sup> (Galloway, 1982). It is anticipated that they are highly 
  vulnerable but also highly adaptable to climate change. Studies over glacial/interglacial 
  cycles show that in the past mangroves have moved landward during periods of 
  rising sea level (Woodroffe, 1993; Wolanski and Chappell, 1996; Mulrennan and 
  Woodroffe, 1998). However, in many locations this will be inhibited now by coastal 
  development. Coastal wetlands are thought to be nursery areas for many commercially 
  important fish (e.g., barramundi), prawns, and mudcrabs.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, estuaries are the most heavily impacted of all coastal waters. 
  Most are situated close to or within urban areas (Burns <i>et al.</i>, 1990). 
  Most have been modified by reclamation or flood control works and have water-quality 
  problems resulting from surrounding land use. Increasing coastal sedimentation 
  is having a marked effect on many estuaries. This may increase with increased 
  rainfall variability. In the South Island, increased coastal sedimentation has 
  disrupted fish nursery grounds and destroyed weed beds, reef sponges, and kelp 
  forests; in the North Island it has been linked to loss of seagrasses through 
  worsening water clarity (RSNZ, 1993; Turner, 1995).</p>
<p>Over a long period, warming of the sea surface is expected (on average) to 
  be associated with shoaling (thinning) of the mixing layer, lowering of phytoplankton 
  growth-limiting dissolved inorganic nutrients in surface waters (Harris <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1987; Hadfield and Sharples 1996), and biasing of the ecosystem toward 
  microbial processes and lowered downward flux of organic carbon (Bradford-Grieve 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). However, this would be modified regionally by any change 
  in the Pacific Ocean to a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like mean state. Warming also 
  may lead to decreased storage of carbon in coastal ecosystems (Alongi <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>There is now palaeo-oceanographic evidence documenting environmental responses 
  east of New Zealand to climatic warming, especially the Holocene "optimum" 
  (~6-7 ka) and interglacial optimum (~120-125 ka), when SSTs were 1-2&deg;C 
  warmer than present. Immediately prior to and during those two periods, oceanic 
  production appears to have increased, as manifested by greater amounts of calcareous 
  nanoplankton and foraminifers (e.g., Lean and McCave, 1998; Weaver <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998). Other evidence suggests that storms in the New Zealand region may have 
  been more frequent in warmer epochs (Eden and Page, 1998), affecting the influx 
  of terrigenous material into the continental shelf (Foster and Carter, 1997). 
  There also may be a relationship between strong El Ni&ntilde;o events and the 
  occurrence of toxic algal blooms in New Zealand waters (Chang <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998). Nevertheless, we do not know, over the longer term, how the oceanic biological 
  system in the southwest Pacific will be influenced by the interaction of ENSO 
  events with the overall warming trend.</p>
<p>South of the subtropical front, primary production is limited by iron availability 
  (Boyd <i>et al.</i>, 1999), which has varied in the past. It is not known how 
  or whether aeolian iron supply to the Southern Ocean in the southwest Pacific 
  (Duce and Tindale, 1991) may be altered by climate change, although it could 
  be affected by changes in aridity and thus vegetation cover over Australia as 
  well as by strengthening of the westerlies. In any case, Harris <i>et al.</i> 
  (1988) demonstrate that the strength of the zonal westerly winds is linked to 
  recruitment of stocks of spiny lobsters over a wide area.</p>
<p>If reduction or cessation of North Atlantic or Antarctic bottomwater formation 
  were to occur (Manabe and Stouffer, 1994; Hirst, 1999), this could lead to significant 
  changes in deep ocean chemistry and dynamics, with wide ramifications for marine 
  life. The common southern hemisphere copepod <i>Neocalanus tonsus</i> could 
  be affected because it spends part of the year at depths between 500 and 1,300 
  m but migrates seasonally to surface waters, becoming the focus of feeding of 
  animals such as sei whales and birds (Bradford-Grieve and Jillett, 1998).</p>
<p>The northern part of New Zealand is at the southern extension of the distribution 
  of marine subtropical flora and fauna (Francis and Evans, 1993). With a warming 
  climate, it is possible that many species would become a more permanent feature 
  of the New Zealand flora and fauna and extend further south.</p>

<h3>12.4.8. Landscape Management as a Goal for Conservation and Adaptation</h3>
<p>Ecosystems that are used for food and fiber production form a mosaic in a landscape 
  in which natural ecosystems also are represented. Aquatic systems, notably rivers 
  and groundwater, often play a crucial role. Given the issues of fragmentation 
  and salinization in many parts of the region, especially Australia, landscape 
  management as an integrated approach (PMSEIC, 1999) may be one of the best ways 
  of achieving conservation goals and human needs for food and fiber in the face 
  of multiple stresses&#151;of which climate change is only one.</p>
<p>This complex interconnection of issues in land management is evident in most 
  parts of Australia and New Zealand&#151;notably in the tropical coastal zone 
  of Queensland, where rapid population and economic growth has to be managed 
  alongside agricultural land use that impacts soil and riverine discharge into 
  the waters of the GBR, a growing tourist industry, fisheries, indigenous people's 
  rights, as well as the climatic hazards of tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts. 
  Climate change and associated sea-level rise are just one of several major issues 
  in this context that may be significant in adding stress to a complex system.</p>
<p>Similar complexities arise in managing other major areas such as the Murray-Darling 
  basin, where control of land degradation through farm and plantation forestry 
  is being considered as a major option, partly for its benefits in controlling 
  salinization and waterlogging and possibly as a new economic option with the 
  advent of incentives for carbon storage as a greenhouse mitigation measure. 
  Similar problems and processes apply in New Zealand, where plantation forestry 
  is regarded as a major option in land use and GHG mitigation.</p>
