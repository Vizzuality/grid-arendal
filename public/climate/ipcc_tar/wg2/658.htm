<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>This chapter synthesizes the results of Work Group II of the Third Assessment 
  Report (TAR) and assesses the state of knowledge concerning Article 2 of the 
  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The TAR's 
  task is to define what is known about the effects of climate change: how sensitive 
  systems are, what adaptive capacity they have, and what their vulnerability 
  is. It is not the goal of this assessment to determine whether these effects 
  are tolerable or are considered dangerous. </p>
<p>The goal of this chapter is to synthesize information on climate change impacts 
  in a manner that will enable readers to evaluate the relationship between increases 
  in global mean temperature and impacts. The chapter focuses on certain "reasons 
  for concern" that may aid readers in making their own determination about 
  what is a "dangerous" climate change. Each reason for concern is consistent 
  with a paradigm that can be used by itself or in combination with other paradigms 
  to help determine what level of climate change is dangerous. The reasons for 
  concern are:</p>
<p><ol><li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and damage to 
  or irreparable loss of unique and threatened systems<br>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and the distribution 
  of impacts<br>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and global aggregate 
  damages<br>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and the probability 
  of extreme weather events<br>
  <li> The relationship between global mean temperature increase and the probability 
  of large-scale singular events such as the breakup of the West Antarctic Ice 
  Sheet or the collapse of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.</ol>
<p>In addition, we examine what observed effects of climate change tell us with 
  regard to Article 2 of the UNFCCC. Increase in global mean temperature since 
  1900 (i.e., mean global warming) is used as the common metric against which 
  impacts are measured. This metric is closely related to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
  concentrations but is more relevant for impact assessments.</p>
<p>Some general caveats apply to all of the reasons for concern:</p>
<p><ul><li>In spite of many studies on climate change impacts, there still is substantial 
  uncertainty about how effective adaptation will be (and could be) in ameliorating 
  negative effects of climate change and taking advantage of positive effects.<br>
  <li> The effect of changes in baseline conditions, such as population and 
  economic growth and development of new technologies that could change vulnerability, 
  has not been adequately considered in most impact studies.<br>
  <li> Most impact studies assess the effects of a stable climate, so our understanding 
  of what rates of change may be dangerous is limited.</ul>
<p>It does not appear to be possible to combine the different reasons for concern 
  into a unified reason for concern that has meaning and is credible. However, 
  we can review the relationship between impacts and temperature for each reason 
  for concern and draw some preliminary conclusions about the potential severity 
  and risk of impacts for the individual reasons for concern. Note that the following 
  findings do not incorporate the costs of limiting GHG emissions to levels that 
  are sufficient to avoid changes that may be considered dangerous. Also note 
  that there is substantial uncertainty regarding the impacts of climate change 
  at the temperatures mentioned. These temperatures should be taken as approximate 
  indications of impacts, not as absolute thresholds. In addition, change in global 
  mean temperature does not describe all relevant aspects of climate change impacts, 
  such as rate and pattern of change and changes in precipitation, extreme climate 
  events, or lagged (or latent) effects such as rising sea levels. For simplification, 
  we group different levels of temperature increase into "small," "medium," 
  and "large." "Small" denotes a global mean temperature increase 
  of as much as approximately 2&deg;C; "medium" denotes a global mean 
  temperature increase of approximately 2-3&deg;C; and "large" 
  denotes a global mean temperature increase of more than approximately 3&deg;C.</p>
<p>Based on a review of the literature of observations of climate change impacts, 
  as reflected in other chapters in the TAR, we conclude the following:</p>
<p><ul><li> Observations: Statistically significant associations between trends 
  in regional climate and impacts have been documented in ~100 physical processes 
  and ~450 biological species or communities in terrestrial and polar environments. 
  Although the presence of multiple factors (e.g., land-use change, pollution, 
  biotic invasion) makes attribution of observed impacts to regional climate change 
  difficult, more than 90% (~99% physical, ~80% biophysical) of the changes documented 
  worldwide are consistent with how physical and biological processes are known 
  to respond to climate. Based on expert judgment, we have high confidence that 
  the overall patterns and processes of observations reveal a widespread and coherent 
  impact of 20th-century climate changes on many physical and biological systems. 
  Signals of regional climate change impacts may be clearer in physical and biological 
  systems than in socioeconomic systems, which also are simultaneously undergoing 
  many complex changes that are not related to climate change, such as population 
  growth and urbanization. Socioeconomic systems have complex and varying mechanisms 
  for adapting to climate change. There are preliminary indications that some 
  social and economic systems have been affected in part by 20th-century regional 
  climate changes (e.g., increased damages from flooding and droughts in some 
  locations). It generally is difficult to separate climate change effects from 
  coincident or alternative explanations for such observed regional impacts.<br>
  <li> Unique and Threatened Systems: Tropical glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, 
  ecotones, and biodiversity "hot spots" are examples of unique and 
  threatened entities that are confined to narrow geographical ranges and are 
  very sensitive to climate change. However, their degradation or loss could affect 
  regions outside their range. There is medium confidence that several of these 
  systems will be affected by a small temperature increase; for example, coral 
  reefs will bleach and glaciers will recede. At higher magnitudes of temperature 
  increase, other and more numerous unique and threatened systems would be adversely 
  affected. <br>
  <li> Distribution of Impacts: The impacts of climate change will not be evenly 
  distributed among the peoples of the world. There is high confidence that developing 
  countries will be more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries, 
  and there is medium confidence that climate change would exacerbate income inequalities 
  between and within countries. There also is medium confidence that a small temperature 
  increase would have net negative impacts on market sectors in many developing 
  countries and net positive impacts on market sectors in many developed countries. 
  However, there is high confidence that with medium to high increases in temperature, 
  net positive impacts would start to decline and eventually would turn negative, 
  and negative impacts would be exacerbated. Estimates of distributional effects 
  are uncertain because of aggregation and comparison methods, assumptions about 
  climate variability, adaptation, levels of development, and other factors.<br>
  <li> Aggregate Impacts: With a small temperature increase, there is medium 
  confidence that aggregate market sector impacts would amount to plus or minus 
  a few percent of world gross domestic product (GDP), and there is low confidence 
  that aggregate nonmarket impacts would be negative. Most people in the world 
  would be negatively affected by a small to medium temperature increase. Most 
  studies of aggregate impacts find that there are net damages at the global scale 
  beyond a medium temperature increase and that damages increase from there with 
  further temperature increases. The important qualifications raised with regard 
  to distributional analysis (previous bullet item) also apply to aggregate analysis. 
  By its nature, aggregate analysis masks potentially serious equity differences. 
  Estimates of aggregate impacts are controversial because they treat gains for 
  some as canceling out losses for others and because the weights that are used 
  to aggregate over individuals are necessarily subjective.<br>
  <li> Extreme Climate Effects: The frequency and magnitude of many extreme 
  climate events increase even with a small temperature increase and will become 
  greater at higher temperatures (high confidence). Extreme events include, for 
  example, floods, soil moisture deficits, tropical and other storms, anomalous 
  temperatures, and fires. The impacts of extreme events often are large locally 
  and could strongly affect specific sectors and regions. Increases in extreme 
  events can cause critical design or natural thresholds to be exceeded, beyond 
  which the magnitude of impacts increases rapidly (high confidence).<br>
  <li> Large-Scale Singularities: Large-scale singularities in the response 
  of the climate system to external forcing, such as shutdown of the North Atlantic 
  thermohaline circulation or collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, have occurred 
  in the past as a result of complex forcings. Similar events in the future could 
  have substantial impacts on natural and socioeconomic systems, but the implications 
  have not been well studied. Determining the timing and probability of occurrence 
  of large-scale singularities is difficult because these events are triggered 
  by complex interactions between components of the climate system. The actual 
  impact could lag the climate change cause (involving the magnitude and the rate 
  of climate change) by decades to millenia. There is low to medium confidence 
  that rapid and large temperature increases would exceed thresholds that would 
  lead to large-scale singularities in the climate system.</ul>
