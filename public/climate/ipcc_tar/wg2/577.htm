<p><a name="fig155"></a>Tourism is a major sector of the global economy, with 
  global receipts from international tourism of US$439 billion in 1998. With a 
  projected annual growth rate of 6.7%, annual international tourism expenditures 
  are expected to surpass US$2 trillion by 2020 (WTO, 1998). The United States 
  and Canada were among the top 10 tourism destinations in terms of international 
  tourist arrivals, with related 1998 receipts of US$71 billion and US$9 billion, 
  respectively (WTO, 1999). Domestic tourism is many times more important in terms 
  of participation and economic activity. The magnitude of the implications of 
  climate change for the tourism and recreation sector will depend on the distribution 
  and importance of tourism and recreation phenomena and the characteristics of 
  climate change and variability. In the United States, the Pacific and south 
  Atlantic regions are major providers of tourism and recreation opportunities. 
  However, if population distribution is taken into consideration, less populated 
  areas often have high economic dependence on tourism and recreation. </p>
<p>One critically important dimension of the tourism and recreation sector that 
  will be sensitive to climate change is the length of the operating season. Any 
  changes in season length would have considerable implications for the short- 
  and long-term viability of tourism and recreation enterprises. In Canada, where 
  43% of domestic and 62% of international tourism expenditures take place in 
  July through September, an extended warm-weather recreation season is likely 
  to be economically beneficial (Wilton and Wirjanto, 1998). The limited regional 
  studies of golfing, camping, and boating that are available reinforce this conclusion 
  (Wall, 1998a,b). This positive outlook must be tempered with the possibility 
  that economic benefits may occur at the expense of increased environmental deterioration, 
  as destinations host more visitors for longer periods of time. These concerns 
  will be particularly relevant for national parks and other natural areas, which 
  may need to establish "no-go" zones or visitation limits.</p>
<p>Conversely, winter recreations&#151;such as downhill skiing, cross-country 
  skiing, snowmobiling, ice fishing, and other activities that are dependent on 
  snow or ice&#151;as well as the businesses and destination areas associated 
  with them are likely to be impacted negatively. Case studies from the Great 
  Lakes (McBoyle and Wall, 1992) and New England (Bloomfield and Hamburg, 1997) 
  regions indicate that the vulnerability of ski resorts will differ considerably, 
  depending on location (latitude and altitude) and adaptations (snowmaking) to 
  offset or compensate for the effects of less reliable snow conditions. Another 
  potential adaptive strategy is diversification of activities to ensure that 
  investments in property and infrastructure generate income and employment for 
  much of the year. Without analysis of the impacts of altered snow conditions 
  for major ski areas in the mountain ranges of western Canada and the United 
  States and the large snowmobile industry in both nations, the economic impact 
  to the winter recreation sector in North America remains uncertain.<br>
</p>
<p>Perhaps as important as changes to season length will be the impact of climate 
  change on the availability and quality of the resource base on which recreational 
  activities depend. Below-average Great Lakes water levels in 1999 again revealed 
  the sensitivity of marinas and the substantial recreational boating industry 
  to climate variability. Similarly, the impact of the 1988 drought on Prairie 
  wetlands and waterfowl breeding success is illustrative of the potential impact 
  of climate change for this sport-hunting resource. Global warming is anticipated 
  to modify many other ecosystems on which outdoor recreations depend. Parks and 
  other natural areas are important tourism and recreation resources whose attractions 
  are based to a considerable extent on the species they conserve and the ecological 
  processes they sustain. A climate change assessment of Canada's National 
  Park system (Scott and Suffling, 2000) indicates that 75-80% of the parks 
  would experience a shift in dominant vegetation under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios. 
  Analysis of vegetation response in the Yellowstone National Park region in the 
  United States revealed regional extinctions and the emergence of communities 
  with no current analog (Bartlein <i>et al</i>., 1997). Moreover, a global analysis 
  of habitat change resulting from climate change found that more than 50% of 
  the territory of seven Canadian provinces and greater than 33% of the territory 
  in 11 U.S. states are at risk (Malcolm and Markham, 2000). Although this will 
  pose an unprecedented challenge to the conservation mandate of protected areas, 
  the impact of ecological changes on tourism remains uncertain. </p>

                <b>Figure 15-6</b>: Ratio of property/casualty insurance premiums 
                to catastrophe losses. This measure of exposure ranges from 180:1 
                in 1974 to 52:1 in 1999, with a minimum value of 27:1 in 1992 
                (the year of Hurricane Andrew). For Canada, the high value is 
                161:1 in 1990, and the low value is 37:1 in 1999. U.S. premiums 
                are from AM Best and insured natural catastrophe loss figures 
                are from Property Claims Service (Kunreuther and Roth, 1998). 
                Canadian premiums are from Insurance Bureau of Canada (2000) and 
                losses are from Emergency Preparedness Canada (2000). Note that

                events, represented as combined effect of loss magnitude and insurance 
                company capacity (GAO, 2000). This analysis assumes that all insurers 
                place and price policies identically. It excludes reinsurance, 
                as well as local government-supported insurance or reinsurance 
                programs in California and Florida. It also excludes effects of 
                catastrophes striking more than one state (e.g., estimated 1-in-100-year 
                loss for the entire United States is $155 billion). Capacity implied 
                may include some surplus amounts that are not available for paying 
                natural catastrophe claims. Losses that result in claims of more 
                than 20% of surplus trigger initial stage of formal solvency review 
                by National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Puerto Rico 
                (not shown) has a 1-in-100-year loss of US$27.1 billion.</p>
