<h2>13.1. The European Region </h2>
<h3><a name="1311"></a>13.1.1. Previous Work </h3>
<p>Western Europe was the subject of the first multi-country assessment of climate 
  change impacts using general circulation model (GCM)-derived climate scenarios 
  (Meinl and Bach, 1984). This included assessment of impacts on the agricultural, 
  water, and energy sectors in the European Union (EU). Since that time, most 
  assessments have been of single sectors or single countries. Most countries 
  in Europe have now conducted climate impact studies, though these studies generally 
  are based on expert reviews rather than new research. EU-wide assessments have 
  been completed for water (Arnell et al., 1999), agriculture (Harrison et al., 
  1995a), forestry (Kellomäki, 1999), and coastal regions (European Commission, 
  1999). </p>
<p>The IPCC synthesis of regional impacts in its Special Report on Regional Impacts 
  of Climate Change (RICC) captured some of the important likely effects-for example, 
  on water resources, coastal regions, and agriculture-but drew no conclusions 
  concerning effects on ecosystems, soils, forestry, insurance, and mountain regions 
  (IPCC, 1998). The present survey refers to a much more extensive literature 
  base (about three times as much as in RICC) and is able to cover additional 
  fields and draw more specific conclusions. The main differences between the 
  current assessment and the previous one are its coverage of the additional sectors 
  noted above; the distinction it is able to draw between effects on different 
  parts of Europe, particularly between northern and southern Europe; the greater 
  degree of quantification achieved; and its evaluation of the adaptive capacity 
  of different sectors to climate change impacts. This assessment draws substantially 
  on the work of a 3-year review of impacts in Europe funded by the Commission 
  of the European Communities, with extensive additional input of material for 
  non-EU countries (Parry, 2000). </p>
<h3><a name="1312"></a>13.1.2. What is Different about the European Region? </h3>
<h4><a name="13121"></a>13.1.2.1. Geography, Population, Environment </h4>
<p>Europe, a continent with an area of 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, extends from 
  the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Eastern Ural Mountains, the River Ural, 
  and the Caspian Sea in the east and from the Arctic Sea in the north to the 
  Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea in the south. </p>
<p>Europe consists of large areas with low relief, including one of the world's 
  largest uninterrupted plains: the European Plain. There are several mountain 
  ranges; the highest peak is 5,642 m (Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains). The 
  continent is well-watered, with numerous permanent rivers, many of which flow 
  outward from the central part of the continent. </p>
<p>There are five essential types of climate in Europe: maritime, transitional, 
  continental, polar, and Mediterranean. The five major vegetation types are tundra, 
  coniferous taiga (boreal forest), deciduous-mixed forest, steppe, and Mediterranean. 
  A relatively large proportion of Europe is farmed, and about one-third of the 
  area is arable; cereals are the predominant crop.</p>
<p>Europe has a total population of 720 million; it has a higher population density 
  and lower birth rate than any other continent. In several countries of central 
  and eastern Europe, population growth is negative at present, even as low as 
  -1.2% (World Bank, 1999). High life expectancy and low infant mortality are 
  results of advances in health care. Life expectancy at birth is among the highest 
  in the world, in some countries reaching more than 75 years for men and more 
  than 80 years for women (World Bank, 1999). European nations are aging faster 
  than those of any other continent. </p>
<p>Key environmental pressures that are significant at the European scale are 
  identified in the Dobris Report (Stanners and Bourdeau, 1995). They relate to 
  areas such as biodiversity, landscape, soil and land degradation, forest degradation, 
  natural hazards, water management, and recreational environment, among others. 
  Most ecosystems in Europe are managed or semi-managed; they often are fragmented 
  and under stress from pollution and other human impacts. Social concerns include 
  issues such as competitiveness, employment, income, and social mobility (Parry, 
  2000). The relative importance of these issuses varies across Europe. Southern 
  Europe, mountains, and coastal zones have their own sets of environmental concerns, 
  some of which will be aggravated by climate change. </p>
<h4><a name="13122"></a>13.1.2.2. Economy </h4>
<p>The pattern of wealth distribution in the European region is strongly nonhomogeneous. 
  Values of gross national product (GNP) per capita range from US$540 to 44,320 
  in Moldova and Switzerland, respectively (World Bank, 1999). </p>
<p>The 15 states that belong to the European Union (EU) are developed countries 
  with stable economies and high levels of productivity. Their industry is based 
  on modern high technology. The EU has reached a high degree of integration and 
  common economic policy. </p>
<p>Until 1990, several countries in central and eastern Europe (CEE) had centrally 
  planned economies dominated by heavy industry. Since late 1989, the CEE has 
  undergone dramatic economic and political changes toward market economy and 
  democracy. CEE countries labeled as "economies in transition" have been overhauling 
  outdated, ineffective, energy- and raw material-consuming and highly polluting 
  industries. This has been a difficult and long-term process; as a result, in 
  1990-1992, a large drop in GNP was noted in all CEE countries. Subsequently, 
  some countries have managed to achieve solid growth. Poland, for instance, has 
  now experienced nine consecutive years of growth, and its mean annual GNP rise 
  for 1990-1997 is 3.9% (World Bank, 1999). Yet for some other countries, mean 
  annual GNP growth for 1990-1997 has been negative. After the fall of the former 
  political system in CEE, ties between these countries ceased to exist and new 
  subregional links are being built, such as the Vysehrad Group created by Poland, 
  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary and the Central European Free Trade 
  Agreement (CEFTA). Yet the tendency for many countries of CEE now is to seek 
  access to Western institutions. Three countries-the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
  and Poland-joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in March 1999. 
  Five countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia) have 
  started negotiations that are expected to lead to full access to the EU in a 
  few years. Among the macro-level pressures in some countries are within-country 
  ethnic tensions and difficulties of transition toward a democratic system with 
  a market economy. </p>
