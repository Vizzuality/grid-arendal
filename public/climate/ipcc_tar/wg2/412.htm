<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p><b>Will the Climate in Asia Change?</b></p>
<p>Continuing emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are likely to 
  result in significant changes in mean climate and its intraseasonal and interannual 
  variability in the Asian region. Given the current state of climate modeling, 
  projections of future regional climate have only limited confidence. Currently 
  available general circulation models (GCMs) suggest that the area-averaged annual 
  mean warming would be about 3&deg;C in the decade of the 2050s and about 5&deg;C 
  in the decade of the 2080s over the land regions of Asia as a result of future 
  increases in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Under the combined 
  influence of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosols, surface warming would be restricted 
  to about 2.5&deg;C in the 2050s and about 4&deg;C in the 2080s. In general, 
  projected warming over Asia is higher during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter 
  than during summer for both time periods. The rise in surface air temperature 
  is likely to be most pronounced over boreal Asia in all seasons. GCM simulations 
  project relatively more pronounced increases in minimum temperature than in 
  maximum temperature over Asia on an annual mean basis, as well as during winter, 
  hence a decrease in diurnal temperature range (DTR). During summer, however, 
  an increase in DTR is projected, suggesting that the maximum temperature would 
  have more pronounced increases relative to the minimum temperature. The summertime 
  increase in DTR over central Asia is likely to be significantly higher relative 
  to that in other regions. </p>
<p>In general, all GCMs simulate an enhanced hydrological cycle and an increase 
  in area-averaged annual mean rainfall over Asia. An annual mean increase in 
  precipitation of approximately 7% in the 2050s and approximately 11% in the 
  2080s over the land regions of Asia is projected from future increases in atmospheric 
  concentration of greenhouse gases. Under the combined influence of greenhouse 
  gases and sulfate aerosols, the projected increase in precipitation is limited 
  to about 3% and 7% in the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The projected increase 
  in precipitation is greatest during NH winter for both time periods. The increase 
  in annual and winter mean precipitation is projected to be highest in boreal 
  Asia; as a consequence, the annual runoff of major Siberian rivers is expected 
  to increase significantly. Although area-averaged annual mean precipitation 
  is projected to increase in temperate Asia, a decline in summer precipitation 
  is likely over the central parts of arid and semi-arid Asia. Because the rainfall 
  over this region is already low, severe water-stress conditions&#151;leading 
  to expansion of deserts&#151;are quite possible, with rises in surface air temperature 
  and depletion of soil moisture. GCMs show high uncertainty in future projections 
  of winter and summer precipitation over south Asia (with or without aerosol 
  forcings). Because much of tropical Asia is intrinsically linked with the annual 
  monsoon cycle, research into a better understanding of the future behavior of 
  the monsoon and its variability is warranted.</p>
<p><b>Is Asia Vulnerable to Projected Climate Change?</b></p>
<p>Climate change-induced vulnerabilities in Asia have to be understood against 
  the backdrop of the physical, economic, and social environment of the countries 
  in the region. They not only provide benchmarks against which vulnerabilities 
  are to be assessed but also the potential for adaptation to them. The socioeconomic 
  environment of many countries in Asia is characterized by high population density 
  and relatively low rates of economic growth. Surface water and groundwater resources 
  in Asian countries play vital roles in forestry, agriculture, fisheries, livestock 
  production, and industrial activity. The water and agriculture sectors are likely 
  to be most sensitive to climate change-induced impacts in Asia. Forest ecosystems 
  in boreal Asia would suffer from floods and increased volume of runoff associated 
  with melting of permafrost regions. The dangerous processes of permafrost degradation 
  resulting from global warming strengthen the vulnerability of all relevant climate-dependent 
  sectors affecting the economy in high-latitude Asia. Although the frequency 
  and severity of floods eventually would increase in many countries of Asia, 
  arid and semi-arid regions of Asia could experience severe water-stress conditions. 
  The stresses of climate change are likely to disrupt the ecology of mountain 
  and highland systems in Asia. Major changes in high-elevation ecosystems of 
  Asia can be expected as a consequence of the impacts of climate change. Many 
  species of mammals and birds and a large population of many other species in 
  Asia could be exterminated as a result of the synergistic effects of climate 
  change and habitat fragmentation. Glacial melt also is expected to increase 
  under changed climate conditions, which would lead to increased summer flows 
  in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as 
  the glaciers disappear. </p>
<p>Agricultural productivity in Asia is likely to suffer severe losses because 
  of high temperature, severe drought, flood conditions, and soil degradation; 
  food security of many developing countries in the region would be under tremendous 
  threat. There are likely to be large-scale changes in productivity of warmwater 
  and coolwater fish in many countries in Asia. Sea-level rise would cause large-scale 
  inundation along the vast Asian coastline and recession of flat sandy beaches. 
  The ecological security of mangroves and coral reefs around Asia would be put 
  at risk. The monsoons in tropical Asia could become more variable if El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) events become stronger and more frequent in a warmer atmosphere. 
  Countries in temperate and tropical Asia are likely to have increased exposure 
  to extreme events, including forest die-back and increased fire risk, typhoons 
  and tropical storms, floods and landslide, and severe vector-borne diseases.</p>

  <b>Major Risks in Asia from Climate Change</b></p>
<p>Based on present scientific research, the following risks linked to changes 
  in climate and its variability for Asia are identified:<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn11.htm","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>The dangerous processes of permafrost degradation resulting from global 
    warming would increase the vulnerability of many climate-dependent sectors 
    affecting the economy in boreal Asia. *** </li>
  <li>Surface runoff increases during spring and summer periods would be pronounced 
    in boreal Asia. ***</li>
  <li>The frequency of forest fires is expected to increase in boreal Asia. ***</li>
  <li>The large deltas and coastal low-lying areas of Asia could be inundated 
    by sea-level rise. ****</li>
  <li>The developing countries of temperate and tropical Asia already are quite 
    vulnerable to extreme climate events such as droughts and floods; climate 
    change and its variability could exacerbate these vulnerabilities. ****</li>
  <li>Increased precipitation intensity, particularly during the summer monsoon, 
    could increase flood-prone areas in temperate and tropical Asia. There is 
    a potential for drier conditions in arid and semi-arid Asia during summer, 
    which could lead to more severe droughts. ***</li>
  <li>Freshwater availability is expected to be highly vulnerable to anticipated 
    climate change. ****</li>
  <li>Tropical cyclones could become more intense. Combined with sea-level rise, 
    this impact would result in enhanced risk of loss of life and properties in 
    coastal low-lying areas of cyclone-prone countries of Asia. ***</li>
  <li>Crop production and aquaculture would be threatened by a combination of 
    thermal and water stresses, sea-level rise, increased flooding, and strong 
    winds associated with intense tropical cyclones. ****</li>
  <li>Warmer and wetter conditions would increase the potential for a higher incidence 
    of heat-related and infectious diseases in tropical and temperate Asia. ***</li>
  <li>Climate change would exacerbate threats to biodiversity resulting from land-use/cover 
    change and population pressure in Asia.***</li>
