<h1>2.1. Introduction</h1>
<p>In assessing impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change, a large 
  array of methods and tools pertain to specific sectors, scales of analysis, 
  and environmental and socioeconomic contexts. In this chapter, the term <i>methods</i> 
  refers to the overall process of assessment, including tool selection and application; 
  the term tools refers to the formulated means of assessment. It is not the intent 
  of this chapter to comprehensively canvas this full array of methods and <i>tools;</i> 
  clearly, such appraisal falls more properly within the purview of the individual 
  chapters in this volume. The purpose of this chapter is to address several overarching 
  methodological questions that transcend individual sectoral and regional concerns. 
  In so doing, this chapter focuses on five related questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>How can the current effects of climate change be detected?</i> Is climate 
    change already having a discernible effect? One of the key methodological 
    problems is how to unequivocally identify a climate change signal in indicators 
    of change in biotic and abiotic systems. This problem is exemplified in <a href="071.htm">Section 
    2.2</a> by focusing on biological indicators and methodological advances that 
    have been made since the Second Assessment Report (SAR). <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>How can the future effects of climate change be anticipated, estimated, 
    and integrated</i>? Since the SAR, an explosion of climate change vulnerability 
    and adaptation studies has occurred around the world, stimulated in large 
    part by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
    and its national reporting requirements, as well as the availability of international 
    donor support to non-Annex I countries. <a href="080.htm">Section 2.3</a> 
    reflects on methodological developments and needs for such vulnerability and 
    adaptation studies, and <a href="090.htm">Section 2.4</a> focuses on methods 
    for regional and cross-sectoral integration.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <i>How can impacts and adaptations be valued and costed?</i> Ultimately, 
    decisions to avoid or reduce the adverse effects of climate change (or enhance 
    the benefits) require some means of appraisal (monetary or otherwise) of projected 
    impacts and alternative adaptation options. <a href="093.htm">Section 2.5</a> 
    reviews various methods for valuing and costing, including issues of nonmarket 
    effects, equity, integration, and uncertainty. <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>How can uncertainties be expressed and characterized?</i> From the science 
    of climate change to assessments of its impacts, uncertainties compound, resulting 
    in a "cascade of uncertainty" that perplexes decisionmaking. <a href="103.htm">Section 
    2.6</a> canvasses the problems of, and methods for, incorporating uncertainty 
    into policy-relevant assessments.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>What frameworks are available for decisionmaking?</i> Once adaptations 
    have been valued, the choice of adaptation requires methods of weighing and 
    balancing options. <a href="112.htm">Section 2.7</a> summarizes the main decision 
    analytic frameworks (DAFs) that can be used in this context.<br>
    In addressing these questions, the following sections seek to furnish a brief 
    description of the state of methods at hand, methodological developments that 
    have occurred since the SAR, and needs and directions for applications and 
    methods development for the future. <a href="120.htm">Section 2.8</a> contains 
    concluding remarks.</li>
</ul>
