<h4>10.2.2.6. Adaptation Strategies </h4>
<p>The nature and processes of human adaptation to long-range climate change are 
  poorly understood, especially in Africa (but see Chemane <i>et al.,</i> 1997; 
  Vogel, 1998). Often, human responses are assumed, or assumed to be rational 
  with foresight and equity. <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>, Smith and Lenhart 
  (1996), and Smithers and Smit (1997) provide overviews; national assessments 
  provide more detail. </p>
<p>A promising approach for much of Africa is to cope with current climate variability 
  through the use of seasonal climate forecasting (e.g., Mason <i>et al.,</i> 
  1996; Mattes and Mason, 1998; Washington <i>et al.,</i> 1999; Dilley, 2000). 
  If farmers can adapt to current year-to-year variability through the use of 
  advance information on the future season's climate and institutional systems 
  are in place to respond to short-term changes (such as early warning systems), 
  communities will be in a position to adapt to longer term climate changes. For 
  example, a seasonal maize water-stress forecast for the primary maize-growing 
  regions of South Africa and Zimbabwe anticipates water stress 6 months prior 
  to harvest, with hindcast correlation over 16 seasons of 0.92 for South Africa 
  and 0.62 for Zimbabwe, based on correlations between water stress and historical 
  global SST and sea-level pressure records (Martin <i>et al.,</i> 2000). Similar 
  forecasts are possible in other regions and for other crops; however, seasonal 
  forecasting by itself will not improve food security (e.g., Stack, 1998).</p>
<p>Better soil and water conservation practices, more tolerant crop varieties, 
  improved pest and weed control, and more use of irrigation also are needed to 
  adapt to changes in the weather. Omenda et al. (1998) recommend that in areas 
  predicted to have a decline in precipitation, research into the development 
  of maize varieties that are higher yielding, drought-resistant, early maturing, 
  and disease- and pest-tolerant is desirable. They further suggest that methods 
  of improving maize culture be studied, including use of inorganic fertilizers 
  and manure and changes in planting dates. Better adaptation to climate change 
  also will result from the use of improved technologies in agriculture&#151;for 
  example, in irrigation and crop husbandry. It has been suggested (Pinstrum-Anderson 
  and Pandya-Lorch, 1999), for example, that by failing to capitalize on new opportunities 
  that biotechnology offers, SSA may further add to its food insecurity and poverty 
  problems.</p>
<p>Increased meat production can be achieved without massive expansion of area 
  grazed or size of the herds, by application of modern herd and animal diet management. 
  In many situations, this would require a cultural shift from regarding livestock 
  principally as an asset and symbol to regarding them as a production system. 
  Cow-calf systems with supplemental feeding can achieve offtakes of 40% yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (compared to the 10-20% typical of most current herd management in Africa), 
  permitting lower livestock numbers per hectare (Preston and Leng, 1987). This 
  would achieve a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. A limited amount of increased 
  heat tolerance can be introduced through breeding programs.</p>
<p>The Senegal River basin (SRB) provides an illustration of sensitivity to climatic 
  variations and opportunities for adaptation. The SRB is undergoing fundamental 
  environmental, hydrologic, and socioeconomic transitions (Venema <i>et al.,</i> 
  1997). Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali&#151;through the river basin development 
  authority, the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS)&#151;are 
  promoting irrigated rice production for domestic consumption in the river basin 
  to ease the severe foreign exchange shortfalls facing these riparian nations. 
  With the recent completion of Manantali and Diama dams, year-round irrigated 
  agriculture is now possible in the SRB. The full agricultural development potential 
  of the SRB is constrained, however, by the basin's limited water resources, 
  which are sensitive to climatic variations. An alternative approach to the SRB's 
  scarce water resources is an agricultural development policy that is based on 
  village-scale irrigation projects and intensive, irrigated agroforestry projects 
  (Venema <i>et al.,</i> 1997). Village-scale irrigation is dedicated to low-water-consumption 
  cereal grain crops and is managed by traditional sociopolitical structures. 
  The proposed agroforestry production system has the dual objectives of using 
  irrigation to reestablish a protective biomass cover in the desertifying river 
  valley and reversing drought-induced migration from rural to urban areas. A 
  comparative river system simulation was carried out to analyze the effects of 
  the rice production development policy and the natural resources management 
  policy on the SRB's full agricultural development potential. The simulation 
  study compared three alternative hydrologic scenarios, using the pre-drought 
  era, the 1970s-level drought, and the 1980s-level drought. Dynamic programming 
  applied to water allocation in the Manantali reservoir showed that lower overall 
  water demands for the natural resource policy scenarios had higher agricultural 
  development potential than the proposed policy based on rice production.</p>
<p>A significant drawback in combating effects of climate variability is the failure 
  of African governments to devolve power to people who are affected and to link 
  environmental degradation to economic policy (Darkoh, 1998). Consequently, many 
  programs lack local support or are undermined by conflicting trade and agricultural 
  policies pursued by governments. It is contended that, for sustainable development 
  strategies to work, policies should put the welfare of people at the center 
  of the development agenda and give them the rights and power to determine their 
  future. Policies should empower the people to develop adaptive strategies toward 
  sustainable livelihoods. Moreover, threats posed to the environment and development 
  by protection and overconsumption in the north and structural adjustment programs 
  (SAPs) call for the removal of distortions created by the import barriers of 
  developed countries, curbing of overconsumption, and a fundamental revision 
  in the structure of SAPs to help alleviate poverty and protect the environment 
  in these African countries. It is in the interest of the global community that 
  the environment in Africa is protected.</p>
<p>Operational early warning systems in Africa&#151;including the SADC Regional 
  Early Warning Unit, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine 
  Early Warning System Network, and the World Food Program (WFP) Vulnerability 
  Assessment and Mapping unit&#151;assess the vulnerability of rural households 
  in many parts of Africa to food insecurity each year. Vulnerability assessments 
  generally develop a picture of which geographic areas and which social groups 
  will be unlikely to meet their subsistence needs before the next agricultural 
  season, based on a convergence of available environmental and socioeconomic 
  information (USAID, 1999). The USAID Sahel vulnerability assessment for 1999-2000 
  estimated that 3.8 million people were moderately food insecure in a high-rainfall 
  year (USAID, 2000). This could signify chronic vulnerability resulting from 
  structural weaknesses caused by desertification, climate change, and other long-term 
  environmental and socioeconomic phenomena.</p>
