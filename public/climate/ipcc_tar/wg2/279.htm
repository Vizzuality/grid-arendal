<h4>5.9.2.2. Impacts of Land-Use Change </h4>
<p>Extraction of oil and mineral resources is likely to be the greatest direct 
  human disturbance in the arctic. Although the spatial extent of these disturbances 
  is small, their impacts can be far-reaching because of road and pipeline systems 
  associated with them (Walker et al., 1987). Roads in particular open previously 
  inaccessible areas to new development, either directly related to tourism and 
  hunting or to support facilities for resource extraction.</p>
<p>Changes in goods and services in alpine ecosystems are likely to be dominated 
  by changes in land use associated with grazing, recreation, and other direct 
  impacts, as a result of their proximity to population centers (K&ouml;rner, 
  1999; Walker et al., 2001). Many of the alpine zones with greatest biodiversity, 
  such as the Caucasus and Himalayas, are areas where human population pressures 
  may lead to most pronounced land-use change in alpine zones (Akakhanjanz and 
  Breckle, 1995). Direct impacts from human activities are likely to be most pronounced 
  in lower elevational zones that are most accessible to people (K&ouml;rner, 
  1999). Improved road access to alpine areas often increases human use for recreation, 
  mining, and grazing and increased forestry pressure at lower elevations (Miller 
  et al., 1996). Overgrazing and trampling by people and animals may tend to destabilize 
  vegetation, leading to erosion and loss of soils that are the long-term basis 
  of the productive capacity of alpine ecosystems. </p>
<p>Alpine areas that are downwind of human population or industrial centers experience 
  substantial rates of nitrogen deposition and acid rain (K&ouml;rner, 1999). 
  Continued nitrogen deposition at high altitudes, along with changes in land 
  use that lead to soil erosion, can threaten provision of clean water to surrounding 
  regions. Nitrogen deposition occurs primarily during the winter and is transmitted 
  directly to streams during snowmelt, so it readily enters water supplies (K&ouml;rner, 
  1999). Many places that use water from alpine areas depend on slow release of 
  the water by melting of snowfields in spring and summer. Warming is likely to 
  create a shortened snowmelt season, with rapid water release creating floods 
  and, later, growing-season droughts. These changes in seasonality, combined 
  with increased harvest in montane forests, would amplify floods. </p>
