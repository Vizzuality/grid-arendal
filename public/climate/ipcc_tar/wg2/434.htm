<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Rice is central to nutrition in Asia. In 1997, rice provided about 700 kilocalories 
  per person per day or more for approximately 2.9 billion people, most of whom 
  live in developing countries of Asia and Africa. During the 1990s, rice production 
  and productivity in Asia grew at a much slower rate than did population. Yield 
  deceleration of rice (the annual growth rate declined from 2.8% in the 1980s 
  to 1.1% in the 1990s) in Asia has been attributed to water scarcity, indiscriminate 
  addition and inefficient use of inputs such as inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, 
  and policy issues and the reliance on a narrower genetic material base with 
  impacts on variability (Hazell, 1985; Matson et al., 1997; Naylor et al., 1997). 
  Several other factors also have contributed to productivity stagnation and the 
  decline of rice (lower output/input ratio) in the intensive cropping system 
  (two to three rice crops per year). Key factors currently contributing to the 
  yield gap in different countries of Asia include biophysical, technical/management, 
  socioeconomic, institutional/policy, technology transfer, and adoption/linkage 
  problems. </p>
<p>Urbanization in Asia has accentuated increased demand for fresh vegetables; 
  this demand is to be met by new production areas combined with more intensified 
  horticulture crop management to raise the productivity per unit of land and 
  water. In most cases, urban and peri-urban agriculture initiatives with uncontrolled 
  use of agrochemicals are a high-risk activity. Adequate steps need to be taken 
  at regional and local levels to safeguard specialized and diversified urban 
  production systems (vegetables, fruits, and root crops) through sustainable 
  intensification of natural resource use and strengthening of decision support 
  systems. Increased productivity and sustained production of food grains and 
  legumes, industrial crops (oil, gum and resins, beverage, fiber, medicines, 
  aromatic plants), and horticultural crops through crop diversification is critical 
  for food and nutritional security in Asia.</p>
<p>Even minor deviations outside the "normal" weather range seriously impair the 
  efficiency of externally applied inputs and food production. Moisture stress 
  from prolonged dry spells or thermal stress resulting from heat-wave conditions 
  significantly affect the agricultural productivity when they occur in critical 
  life stages of the crop (Rounsevell et al., 1999). As reported in IPCC (1998), 
  stress on water availability in Asia is likely to be exacerbated by climate 
  change. Several studies aimed at understanding the nature and magnitude of gains 
  or losses in yield of particular crops at selected sites in Asia under elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and associated climatic change have been reported 
  in the literature (e.g., Lou and Lin, 1999). These studies suggest that, in 
  general, areas in mid- and high latitudes will experience increases in crop 
  yield, whereas yields in areas in the lower latitudes generally will decrease 
  (see also <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Climatic variability and change 
  will seriously endanger sustained agricultural production in Asia in coming 
  decades. The scheduling of the cropping season as well as the duration of the 
  growing period of the crop also would be affected. </p>
<p>In general, increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels and a longer frost-free growing 
  season are expected to enhance agricultural productivity in north Asia. The 
  area under wheat cultivation is likely to expand in the north and west. The 
  increase in surface temperature also may increase the growing season in temperate 
  Asia, thereby prolonging the grain-filling period, which may result in higher 
  yields (Rosenzweig and Hillel, 1998). In Japan, for example, simulation studies 
  and field experiments indicate that enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> levels in a warmer 
  atmosphere will substantially increase rice yields and yield stability in northern 
  and north-central Japan (Horie et al, 1995a). In south central and southwestern 
  Japan, however, rice yields are expected to decline by at least 30% because 
  of spikelet sterility and shorter rice growing duration (Matsui and Horie, 1992). 
  Climate change should be advantageous to wheat yield in northeast China. Because 
  of an increase in respiration in a warmer atmosphere demanding more water availability, 
  rice yield in China is expected to decline (Wang, 1996a). In central and north 
  China, higher temperatures during teaseling and drawing stages and low soil 
  moisture could result in reduced wheat yield. Increases in precipitation should 
  be favorable for pests, diseases, and weeds in the south (Wang, 1996b; Dai, 
  1997). In tropical Asia, although wheat crops are likely to be sensitive to 
  an increase in maximum temperature, rice crops would be vulnerable to an increase 
  in minimum temperature. The adverse impacts of likely water shortage on wheat 
  productivity in India could be minimized to a certain extent under elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels; these impacts, however, would be largely maintained for 
  rice crops, resulting in a net decline in rice yields (Aggarwal and Sinha, 1993; 
  Rao and Sinha, 1994; Lal et al., 1998d). Acute water shortage conditions combined 
  with thermal stress should adversely affect wheat and, more severely, rice productivity 
  in India even under the positive effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the future. 
</p>
<p>Key findings on the impacts of an increase in surface temperature and elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> on rice production in Asia&#151;based on a study carried out 
  for Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, 
  South Korea, and Thailand under the Simulation and System Analysis for Rice 
  Production Project at the International Rice Research Institute&#151;are summarized 
  in <a href="#tab115">Table 11-5</a>. Two process-based crop simulation models&#151;the 
  ORYZA1 model (Kropff et al., 1995) and the SIMRIW model (Horie et al., 1995b)&#151;suggest 
  that the positive effects of enhanced photosynthesis resulting from doubling 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> are more than offset by increases in temperature greater than 
  2&deg;C (Matthews et al., 1995a). </p>

<p>More than 10,000 different species of insect pest are found in the tropics, 
  90% of which are active in the humid tropics. The occurrence, development, and 
  spread of crop diseases depend on integrated effects of pathogen, host, and 
  environmental conditions. The survival rate of pathogens in winter or summer 
  could vary with an increase in surface temperature (Patterson et al., 1999). 
  Higher temperatures in winter will not only result in higher pathogen survival 
  rates but also lead to extension of cropping area, which could provide more 
  host plants for pathogens. Thus, the overall impact of climate change is likely 
  to be an enlargement of the source, population, and size of pathogenic bacteria. 
  Damage from diseases may be more serious because heat-stress conditions will 
  weaken the disease-resistance of host plants and provide pathogenic bacteria 
  with more favorable growth conditions. The growth, reproduction, and spread 
  of disease bacteria also depend on air humidity; some diseases&#151;such as 
  wheat scab, rice blast, and sheath and culm blight of rice&#151;will be more 
  widespread in temperate and tropical regions of Asia if the climate becomes 
  warmer and wetter. </p>
