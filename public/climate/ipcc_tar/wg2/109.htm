<h3>2.6.5. Debate over the Quality of Human Judgment</h3>
<h4><a name="2651"></a>2.6.5.1. Deficiencies in Human Judgment </h4>
<p>At some level, human judgment is an unavoidable element of all human decisions. 
  The question, then, naturally arises: How good is human judgment? Psychological 
  studies of human judgment provide evidence for shortcomings and systematic biases 
  in human decisionmaking. Furthermore, not only do people&#151;including experts&#151;suffer 
  various forms of myopia; they also often are oblivious of the fact. Indeed, 
  statistical linear models summarizing the relationship between a set of predictor 
  variables and a predicted outcome often (repeatedly) perform better than intuitive 
  expert judgments (or subjective expert opinions). Burgeoning empirical evidence 
  suggests that humans, including experts, can be inept at making judgments, particularly 
  under conditions of high uncertainty. </p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, psychologists repeatedly have demonstrated human judgmental 
  error and linked these errors to the operational nature of mental processes. 
  The idea, spelled out in Kahneman <i>et al</i>. (1982), is that, because of 
  limited mental processing capacity, humans rely on strategies of simplification, 
  or mental heuristics, to reduce the complexity of judgment tasks. Although this 
  strategy facilitates decisionmaking, these procedures are vulnerable to systematic 
  error and bias.</p>
<h4><a name="2652"></a>2.6.5.2. Violation of Probability Laws</h4>
<p>In a classic series of publications, Tversky and Kahneman (1974, 1983) and 
  Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 1996) claim that human judgment under uncertainty 
  violates normative rules of probability theory. For example, Tversky and Kahneman 
  (1983) invoke the "judgment by a representativeness" heuristic to 
  explain evidence for the <i>conjunction fallacy</i>, whereby a conjunction of 
  events is judged to be more likely than one of its constituents. This is a violation 
  of a perfectly simple principle of probability logic: If A includes B, the probability 
  of B cannot exceed A. Nevertheless, respondents consistently give a higher likelihood 
  to the possibility of a subset or joint event than to the whole set, thereby 
  violating the conjunction rule. Typically, respondents judge likelihood by representativeness 
  (or stereotypes) and thus fail to integrate statistically relevant factors. 
</p>
<p>However, Gigerenzer (1994, 1996) argues that people are naturally adapted to 
  reasoning with probabilities in the form of frequencies and that the conjunction 
  fallacy "disappears" if reasoning is in the form of frequencies. Several 
  studies report that violations of the conjunction rule are rare if respondents 
  are asked to consider the relative frequency of events rather than the probability 
  of a single event. </p>
<p>Kahneman and Tversky (1996) disagree and argue that the frequency format provides 
  respondents with a powerful cue to the relation of inclusion between sets that 
  are explicitly compared or evaluated in immediate succession. When the structure 
  of the conjunction is made more apparent, respondents who appreciate the constraint 
  supplied by the rule will be less likely to violate it.</p>
<p>Kahneman and Lovallo (1993) argue that people have a strong tendency to regard 
  problems as unique although they would be viewed more advantageously as instances 
  of a broader class. People pay particular attention to the distinguishing features 
  of a particular case and reject analogies to other instances of the same general 
  type as crudely superficial and unappealing. Consequently, they fall prey to 
  fallacies of planning by anchoring their estimates on present values or extrapolations 
  of current trends. Despite differing causal theories, both approaches find evidence 
  for poor judgment under uncertainty or, alternatively, evidence that people 
  are better off not attempting to assess probabilities for single events. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, public understanding of likelihood seems to be improved by adoption 
  of frequentist formats. Several studies have shown that experts have great difficulty 
  reasoning with subjective probabilities for unique or single events. However, 
  respondents apparently are much more successful when the same problems are presented 
  with frequencies rather than probabilities. Although experts have difficulties 
  with the probability version&#151;most give wrong answers&#151;most undergraduates 
  readily provide the correct answer to similar problems constructed with frequencies.</p>
<p>Psychological research suggests that measures of risk that are communicated 
  in terms of frequencies rather than probabilities will be more readily understood 
  and rationally responded to, although IAMs need to translate these frequencies 
  into probability distributions (e.g., Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 1996) to portray 
  the wide range of outcomes that currently reflect estimates in the literature 
  and by most IPCC authors.</p>
