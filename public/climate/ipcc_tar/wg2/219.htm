<p><a name="fig53"></a>Rapid climate change is only one of a long list of pressures 
  on wildlife. Alone or in combination, these pressures may greatly increase species' 
  vulnerabilities to rarity and extinction. Pressures such as land use and land-use 
  change, introduction of exotic species, pollution/poisoning, and extreme climatic 
  events and recent rapid climate change are of major concern and are discussed 
  below. Other pressures include wildlife diseases, human persecution (e.g., overharvest, 
  harassment), collisions with towers and other structures, collisions with cars 
  and other forms of transportation, electrocutions, anthropogenic barriers to 
  dispersal, war and other civil conflict, and wildlife trade (see Price <i>et al</i>., 
  2000, for more information and references). <br>
</p>
<p><i>Conversion of natural and semi-natural habitats</i> currently is quite extensive. 
  Although climate change is starting to have observable effects on wildlife and 
  the predicted future impact of climate change is expected to be large, the immediate 
  principal current threat to the world's wildlife is habitat conversion (Vitousek 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997a). Roughly 80% of forests that originally covered the Earth 
  have been cleared or degraded, and logging, mining, or other large-scale developments 
  threaten 39% of what remains (UNEP, 2000). Roughly 65% of Asia's wildlife habitat 
  has been converted to other uses, as well as nearly 75% of Australian rainforests 
  (UNEP, 2000). Habitat conversion and degradation affect nearly 89% of all threatened 
  birds and 83% of all threatened mammals (IUCN, 2000). Nearly 75% of all threatened 
  bird species are found in forests (Stattersfield <i>et al</i>., 1998), and tropical 
  forests are the most species-rich terrestrial habitats; an estimated 90% of 
  the world's species occur in moist tropical forests, which cover only 8% of 
  the land area (UNEP, 2000). </p>
<p><i>Introduction of exotic species</i>, intentionally and accidentally, has 
  had deleterious effects on wildlife populations. Overall, 18% of threatened 
  mammals in Australia and the Americas and 20% of the world's birds are challenged 
  by introduced species (UNEP, 2000). Most extinctions on islands can be tied 
  to introduction of species that prey on native species or destroy critical habitats 
  (Stattersfield, <i>et al</i>., 1998). <br>
  <br>
  <i>Pollution and other biochemical poisonings</i> have direct and indirect effects 
  on wildlife. Chemical contaminants have been detected in the tissues of species 
  from around the globe, in regions such as Brazilian Pantanal wetlands (Alho 
  Cleber and Vieira Luiz, 1997) and remote arctic habitats (UNEP, 2000). The most 
  obvious effects of chemicals are direct poisoning events. These frequently are 
  side effects of pesticide applications and can lead to losses of thousands of 
  individuals (Biber and Salathe, 1991). In addition to affecting wildlife directly, 
  contaminants can indirectly affect them by modifying their habitats. </p>
<p><i>Stochastic and extreme climatic events</i> can cause deaths of large numbers 
  of individuals and contribute significantly to determining species composition 
  in ecosystems (Parmesan <i>et al</i>., 2000). Hurricanes can lead to direct mortality, 
  and their aftermath may cause declines because of loss of resources required 
  for foraging and breeding (Wiley and Wunderle, 1994). Many of these extreme 
  climatic events are cyclical in nature, such as sea surface temperature (SST) 
  changes that are associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). 
  Sea temperature increases associated with ENSO events have been implicated in 
  reproductive failure in seabirds (Wingfield <i>et al</i>., 1999), reduced survival 
  and reduced size in iguanas (Wikelski and Thom, 2000), and major shifts in island 
  food webs (Stapp <i>et al</i>., 1999). Extreme drought in Africa was thought to have 
  contributed to declines in the populations of many Palearctic migratory birds 
  that wintered in the savanna and steppe zones of the Sahel (Biber and Salathe, 
  1991). </p>
<p><i>Climate and climate change</i> are strong drivers of biotic systems. The 
  distribution and survival of most species are moderated by climate (Root, 1988a,b,c; 
  Martin, 1998; Duellman,1999). Although species have responded to climatic changes 
  throughout evolutionary time (Harris, 1993), the primary concern today is the 
  projected rapid rate of change. High species richness appears to be related 
  to stable conditions; abrupt impoverishment of species has occurred during times 
  of rapid change (Tambussi <i>et al</i>., 1993). <br>
  <br>
  <i>Synergistic effects</i> are likely to be quite damaging to animals. As habitat 
  becomes more fragmented, barriers to dispersal or expansions of species' 
  ranges could occur. This could force individuals to remain in inhospitable areas, 
  decreasing the range and population size of species and ultimately leading to 
  extinction (Rabinowitz, 1981). Fragmentation also may facilitate movement of 
  invasive species into an area, leading to potential population declines through 
  predation, competition, or transmission of disease (e.g., May and Norton, 1996). 
  Increasing urbanization also could lead to increasing exposure to contaminants, 
  which may make species less fit to survive changes in environmental conditions 
  or weaken their immune systems (Pounds and Crump, 1987; Berger <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Human responses to climate change also may contribute to synergistic effects; 
  for example, if new pest outbreaks are countered with increased pesticide use, 
  nontarget species might have to endure climate- and contaminant-linked stressors.
