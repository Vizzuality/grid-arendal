<h2>19.3. Impacts on Unique and Threatened Systems </h2>
<h3><a name="1931"></a>19.3.1. What are Unique and Threatened Systems?</h3>
<p>Unique systems are restricted to a relatively narrow geographical range but 
  can affect other entities beyond their range. Indeed, many unique systems have 
  global significance. The fact that these unique entities are restricted geographically 
  points to their sensitivity to environmental variables, including climate, and 
  therefore attests to their potential vulnerability to climate change. </p>
<p>Identification of these unique entities provides the first reason for concern 
  regarding vulnerability to climate change. In this section, we provide examples 
  of unique entities that are likely to be threatened by future changes in climate. 
  From those treated by WGII, we address physical, biological, and human systems. 
  We offer a few examples in each system: tropical glaciers, coral reefs, mangrove 
  ecosystems, biodiversity "hot spots," ecotones, and indigenous communities. 
  These are meant only as illustrative examples; there are many unique and threatened 
  entities. <a href="#tab191">Table 19-1</a> lists some unique and potentially 
  threatened systems in relation to climate change thresholds that may cause adverse 
  effects. <a href="668.htm#tab192">Table 19-2</a> lists some of the unique and 
  threatened systems that are discussed elsewhere in the TAR.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="1932"></a>19.3.2. Physical Systems</h3>
<p>A number of physical systems are threatened by climate change. Among the most 
  prominent are those in regions dominated by cold temperatures, such as glaciers. 
  Many glaciers already are receding, and many are threatened by climate change. 
  Other physical systems, such as small lakes in areas that will become drier 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>), also are threatened by climate change. 
  Changes in unique physical systems can have serious consequences for unique 
  biological and human systems.</p>
<h4><a name="19321"></a>19.3.2.1. Tropical Glaciers</h4>
<p>Tropical glaciers are present on several mountains in Asia, Africa, and Latin 
  America. These glaciers are valuable because, among other reasons, they are 
  a major source of water for people living below them. For example, through a 
  network of mountain streams, meltwater of the Himalayan glaciers contributes 
  a sizeable portion of river flows to the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, and other 
  river systems in south Asia. Similarly, snow accumulates in winter in the high 
  parts of the cordillera in Peru and melts during summer, becoming the main source 
  of water for many rivers in Latin America. In addition, glaciers act as buffers that regulate runoff water 
  supply from mountains to plains during dry and wet spells. Thus, tropical glaciers 
  are instrumental in securing agricultural productivity and livelihoods and provide 
  cultural inspiration for millions of people who live remote from their sources.</p>
<p>Because of the narrow range of ambient temperatures in the tropics, tropical 
  glaciers are more sensitive to climate change than glaciers elsewhere (see <a href="174.htm">Section 
  4.3.11</a>). Indeed, records spanning several decades show accelerated retreat 
  of several Himalayan and other tropical glaciers (see <a href="428.htm">Section 
  11.2.1.2</a>). </p>
<p>In the transient phase of melting, increasing discharge will generate floods 
  in the mountains and immediate vicinity, increased siltation of rivers, and 
  larger sediment load in dams and reservoirs. Riparian mountain ecosystems will 
  be impacted during their dry seasons&#151;in the transient phase by a significant 
  increment of downstream flow, as well as following the transient phase&#151;by 
  significant reduction of this flow. These changes will have tangible economic 
  and cultural implications (see <a href="428.htm">Section 11.2.1.2</a>). This 
  example of a tropical unique entity provides an "early warning" for nontropical 
  glaciers and their potential impacts. </p>
