<h3>13.4.4. Regional Issues</h3>
<h4> <a name="13441"></a>13.4.4.1. Extreme Events </h4>
<p>One of the most important continent-wide issues is the effect of climate change 
  on future water resources, particularly on extreme events-whether abundance 
  or scarcity of water will increase in severity. A tendency toward increases 
  in the frequency of extreme events is likely but largely unquantified. The implications 
  of changes in the characteristics of extreme hydrological events extend beyond 
  the water sector into agriculture, industry, settlements, coastal zones, transport, 
  tourism, health, and insurance. Climate change is likely to lead to increased 
  winter flows in much of Europe. In Mediterranean Europe, it is likely to increase 
  variability in flow through the year, with summer flows reduced. In coastal 
  areas, the risk of flooding and erosion will increase substantially. Instability 
  of thermohaline circulation is a process whose probability of occurrence in 
  the 21st century is low (see <a href="122.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>), 
  yet potential consequences of this on the changing heat budget in Europe are 
  very great. </p>
<h4><a name="13442"></a>13.4.4.2. Subregional Impacts </h4>
<p>Climatic observations and the scenarios presented here suggest that southern 
  Europe will be more adversely affected than northern Europe. A shift in climate-related 
  resources from south to north may occur in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, 
  and forestry. In particular, the Mediterranean region appears likely to be adversely 
  affected. Among likely adverse effects are increased variability of river flow; 
  increased flood risk; decreased summer runoff and recharge of aquifers; and 
  reduced reliability of public water supply, power generation, and irrigation. 
  Increased fire hazards affecting populated regions and forests and heat stress 
  to humans, crops, and livestock may occur. Even a change of tourist destinations 
  is possible if the present optimal summertime climate shifts northward, and 
  heat waves and water shortages may jeopardize the attractiveness of the present 
  southern summer destinations. </p>
<h4><a name="13443"></a>13.4.4.3. Sustainability and Equity </h4>
<p>Sustainable development (understood as relaying natural capital to future generations 
  in a nondepleted state) has been in jeopardy in Europe from several existing 
  pressures, mostly nonclimatic (e.g., land-use change, environmental pollution, 
  atmospheric deposition). Yet climate change adds an important element to the 
  threat to the environment. Sea-level rise threatens coastal habitats with a 
  squeeze between hard defenses and rising water levels. Most (50-90%) of the 
  alpine glaciers could disappear by the end of the 21st century, and there may 
  be local extinctions of species that require cold habitats for their survival 
  (e.g., subarctic and montane species). Many ecosystems will respond to climate 
  change via migration and change; a policy challenge is how to manage these changes.</p>
<p>Finally, climate change impacts will be differently distributed among different 
  regions, generations, age classes, income groups, occupations, and genders. 
  This has important equity implications, although these implications have not 
  been investigated in detail. For example, elderly and sick people suffer more 
  in heat waves. There is greater vulnerability, in general, in southern than 
  in northern Europe. Mediterranean and mountain farmers are likely to be worse 
  off in a warmer world. This presents a challenge to existing regional policies 
  within the EU that are aimed at leveling up less-developed areas (peripheral 
  Europe versus core Europe). In general, the more marginal and less wealthy areas 
  will be less able to adapt, so climate change without appropriate policies of 
  response may lead to greater inequity.</p>
<p>Possible climate change impacts on key resources are sufficient to warrant 
  early consideration by European policymakers to ensure sustainable development. 
  In general, the adaptation potential of socioeconomic systems in much of Europe 
  is high because of economic conditions, a stable population with the capacity 
  to move within the region, and well-developed political, institutional, and 
  technological support systems.</p>
