<h4>14.2.2.3. Plantation Silviculture</h4>
<p>Plantation forestry is a major land use in Brazil and is expected to expand 
  substantially over coming decades (Fearnside, 1998). Climatic change can be 
  expected to reduce silvicultural yields to the extent that the climate becomes 
  drier in major plantation states such as Minas Gerais, Esp&iacute;rito Santo, 
  S&atilde;o Paulo, and Paran&aacute; as a result of global warming and/or reduced 
  water vapor transport from Amazonia (e.g., Eagleson, 1986). Dry-season changes 
  can be expected to have the greatest impact on silvicultural yields. Water often 
  limits growth during this part of the year under present conditions, yet there 
  may be water to spare during the rainiest part of the year. In areas outside 
  of Brazil's extreme south, annual rings that are evident in the wood of 
  plantation trees correspond to dry (as opposed to cold) seasons.</p>
<p>The effect of precipitation changes on plantation yields can be approximated 
  by using a regression equation developed by Ferraz (1993) that relates biomass 
  increment in Eucalyptus to precipitation at three sites in the state of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo (Fearnside, 1999). UKMO model results (Gates<i> et al., </i>1992) indicate 
  that annual rainfall changes for regions of Brazil would cause yields to decrease 
  by 6% in Amazonia and 8% in southern Brazil and increase by 4% in the northeast. 
  During the June-July-August (JJA) rainfall period, yields would decrease by 
  12% in Amazonia, 14% in southern Brazil, and 21% in the northeast (Fearnside, 
  1999).</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion of precipitation decreases considers only the effect 
  of global warming. Brazil is likely to suffer additional losses of precipitation 
  as a result of reductions in evapotranspiration caused by deforestation in Amazonia 
  (see Section 14.5.1.1.1). Some of the water vapor originating in Amazonia is 
  transported to southern Brazil (Salati and Vose, 1984; Eagleson, 1986). Decreased 
  water vapor supply to southern Brazil, where most of the country's silviculture 
  is located, would aggravate precipitation declines stemming from global warming.</p>
<p>The direct effects of rainfall reduction on yields are likely to underestimate 
  the true effect of climate change. Synergistic effects with other factors could 
  reduce yield substantially more&#151;for example, through attack by pests (Cammell 
  and Knight, 1992).</p>
<p>A drier climate in plantation areas also could be expected to lead to greater 
  fire hazard. Fire is a problem in plantation silviculture even in the absence 
  of climatic change, requiring a certain level of investment in fire control 
  and a certain level of losses when burns occur. Pine plantations in Paran&aacute; 
  require continuous vigilance (Soares, 1990). Eucalyptus also is fire-prone because 
  of the high content of volatile oils in the leaves and bark.</p>
<p>Temperature changes can affect plantation yields. The models reviewed in the 
  IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR) indicate a temperature increase of 
  2-3&deg;C in Amazonia (Mitchell<i> et al.,</i> 1995; Kattenberg <i>et al., 
  </i>1996). Considering a hypothetical increase of 1.5&deg;C by the year 2050 
  in Esp&iacute;rito Santo and Minas Gerais, Reis et al. (1994) conclude that 
  the present plantation area would have to be moved to a higher elevation (a 
  shift that is considered impractical) or the genetic material would have to 
  be completely replaced, following the global strategy proposed by Ledig and 
  Kitzmiller (1992). In addition to direct effects of temperature considered by 
  Reis <i>et al</i>. (1994), temperature increases have a synergistic effect with 
  drought; the impact of dryness is worse at higher temperatures (lower elevations) 
  as a result of higher water demands in plantations.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment would be beneficial for plantations. Higher atmospheric concentrations 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> increase the water-use efficiency (WUE) of Eucalyptus. Photosynthetic 
  rate increased in these experiments from 96% (E. urophylla) to 134% (E. grandis). 
  Growth of different plant parts showed similar responses. Higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  also stimulate nitrogen fixation, which could be expected to lower the fertilizer 
  demands of plantations (Hall <i>et al.,</i> 1992).</p>
<p>Climatic change would require larger areas of plantations (and consequently 
  greater expense) to meet the same levels of demand. The percentage increase 
  in areas required can be greater than the percentage decline in per-hectare 
  yields caused by climatic change because expansion of plantation area implies 
  moving onto progressively poorer sites where productivity will be lower. Taking 
  as examples rainfall reductions of 5, 10, 25, and 50%, plantation area requirements 
  are calculated to increase as much as 38% over those without climatic change, 
  which would bring the total plantation area by 2050 to 4.5 times the 1991 area 
  (Fearnside, 1999).</p>
