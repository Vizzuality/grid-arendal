<h3><a name="1729"></a>17.2.9. Human Welfare</h3>
<h4><a name="17291"></a>17.2.9.1. Settlement and Infrastructure</h4>
<p>In most small island states (including high islands such as Seychelles, Reunion, 
  and Fiji), narrow coastal plains provide attractive locations for settlement 
  and a variety of infrastructure to support economic and social needs. Most of 
  the population, settlements, and economic activities are concentrated in areas 
  where competition for space is acute and where fragile ecosystems, aquatic and 
  terrestrial, coexist. In most Caribbean islands, for example, more than 50% 
  of the population live within 2 km of the coast. On atolls, most of the important 
  infrastructure and population clusters often are less than 100 m from the shoreline. 
  As the shortage of coastal space becomes increasingly acute in many small islands, 
  land reclamation often is practiced as a solution to this need. Ironically, 
  this practice exposes these islands to greater risk by attracting more settlement 
  and infrastructure to already highly vulnerable locations.</p>
<p>As elsewhere, coastal development in most small islands has been undertaken 
  in the past without taking climate change and sea-level projections into consideration. 
  With currently projected rates of sea-level rise and flooding, coupled with 
  the possibility of more intense and frequent extreme events such as cyclones 
  (hurricanes) and associated storm surge, critical infrastructure such as social 
  services, airports, port facilities, roads, coastal protection structures, tourism 
  facilities, and vital utilities will be at severe risk. Furthermore, the capacity 
  of most small island states to respond effectively to these threats is limited 
  by their low adaptive capacity, which results from a combination of factors&#151;including 
  physical size (little opportunity to retreat), limited access to capital and 
  technology, and a shortage of human resource skills.</p>
<p>In some countries, particularly the low islands and micro-atolls, resettlement 
  within national boundaries may have to be considered as the only viable option. 
  However, implementation of this strategy could become extremely complicated, 
  especially for densely populated coastal lowlands such as in the Federated States 
  of Micronesia (950 persons km<sup>-2</sup>), Majuro, Marshall Islands (2,188 
  persons km<sup>-2</sup>) and Male, Republic of Maldives (35,000 persons km<sup>-2</sup>). 
  In extreme circumstances, it may even become necessary to abandon some atolls 
  altogether (Nurse<i> et al., </i>1998). Such an option would be socially and 
  culturally disruptive and would require access to substantial resources&#151;which 
  most of these countries may be unable to afford. </p>
<h4><a name="17292"></a>17.2.9.2. Human Health</h4>
<p>Increased instability of weather patterns and large interannual variability 
  in climate enhanced by ENSO forcing and GHG-induced climate change have catalyzed 
  a new focus on possible health consequences in a changing climate (Epstein, 
  1997; Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 1997; Hales <i>et al.,</i> 1997; Woodward <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1998). Many tropical islands are now experiencing high incidences of 
  vector- and water-borne diseases that are attributed to changes in temperature 
  and rainfall regimes, which may be linked to events such as ENSO, droughts, 
  and floods. In the Pacific, there is growing evidence that outbreaks of dengue 
  are becoming more frequent and appear to be strongly correlated with the ENSO 
  phenomenon (Hales <i>et al.,</i> 1997, 1999a). Many of the small island states 
  lie in the tropical zone, where the climate is suitable for the transmission 
  of tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue, filariasis, and schistosomiasis. 
</p>
<p>Some of the small island states, such as the Bahamas, Kiribati, the Marshall 
  Islands, and the Maldives, are a mere 3-4 m above mean sea level, which predisposes 
  them to inundation with seawater and, as a consequence, salinization of freshwater 
  supplies and flooding from sea-level rise. Furthermore, low-lying islands are 
  particularly vulnerable to storms and cyclones; these also can adversely affect 
  public water supplies. Vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are 
  particularly sensitive to warming and flooding. Filariasis and schistosomiasis 
  are less sensitive to short-term seasonal climatic changes, but the epidemiology 
  of these diseases could change with long-term effects of climate change. Water-borne 
  diseases such as shigella, cryptosporidium, giardia, and amoebiasis could increase 
  as a result of disruption of sewage and water systems by flooding (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>).</p>
<p>It is also projected that, with temperature and rainfall changes, some vectors 
  could extend their range, so there is likely to be wider transmission of some 
  diseases (McMichael, 1996). For example, malaria&#151;which previously tended 
  to be confined largely to the western and central Pacific region&#151;now appears 
  to be extending east as far as Fiji. It also is worth noting that the interior 
  uplands of many islands, which now are virtually free of vectors (e.g., Aedes 
  aegypti mosquito) that transmit malaria, dengue, and other tropical illnesses&#151;could 
  become favorable breeding sites in a changing climate (disease-specific details 
  appear in <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p>In some regions&#151;for example, the Pacific&#151;it has been noted that extreme 
  weather events appear to be occurring at a higher frequency than elsewhere (Timmerman<i> 
  et al.,</i> 1997). As a consequence, physical injuries arising from these events 
  can be expected to increase. </p>
<p>It is well-established that vulnerability to such health risks will vary according 
  to factors such as availability of quality health care, the present health status 
  of the population, and availability of technical and other resources (McMichael, 
  1993; WHO, 1996). Unfortunately, health care facilities and related infrastructure 
  in many small island states and other developing countries often are inadequate. 
  Hence, the resilience of such states and their capacity to respond effectively 
  to (or mitigate) increasing health threats posed by climate change is likely 
  to be low. </p>
<p>A range of adaptation strategies for reducing the severity of possible climate 
  change-related health threats has been proposed, and many of these measures 
  may be successfully pursued in the small island states. Such measures include, 
  inter alia, implementation of effective health education programs, preventive 
  maintenance and improvement of health care facilities, cost-effective sewerage 
  and solid waste management practices, and disaster preparedness plans (McMichael, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Adoption of efficient early warning systems also would be beneficial in vulnerable 
  small islands (Stern and Easterling, 1999). This process would involve monitoring 
  of health-risk indicators by improving the forecasting of conditions that are 
  favorable to the outbreak of climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue, cholera, 
  and malaria (Patz<i> et al., </i>1996; IPCC, 1998; Epstein, 1999). Where large 
  populations exist, as in urban areas, simple, low-cost measures could be implemented 
  to control the vectors of dengue and other diseases, where a risk of transmission 
  exists. At the individual level, insecticide-treated bed nets could provide 
  protection against vectors of malaria and filariasis. Simple technology, such 
  as the use of sari cloth to filter drinking water, reduces the risk of cholera 
  transmission at the household level. Although some measures for adapting to 
  climate change can be deferred, early implementation of preventive strategies 
  could reduce current and future health "costs." </p>
<h3><a name="17210"></a>17.2.10. Other Economic and Sociocultural Impacts</h3>
<p>Climate change could have direct and indirect impacts on other economic and 
  social sectors in some small islands. The insurance industry is one sector that 
  is highly sensitive to the magnitude and frequency of various hazards, including 
  climate-related phenomena such as tropical storms and floods. Because insurance 
  premiums are based on assessment of risk of occurrence of a particular event, 
  any indication of an increase in the frequency or intensity of phenomena such 
  as tropical cyclones and floods is likely to trigger an increase in the cost 
  of insurance. Within the past decade, insurance costs in the Caribbean have 
  increased significantly, following the passage of a series of severe hurricanes 
  that caused widespread socioeconomic dislocation, injury, and loss of life. 
  Claims were so high that some reinsurance companies withdrew from the market; 
  others imposed higher deductibles, separate conditions for windstorms, and a 
  premium structure to minimize the risk of underinsurance (Murray, 1993; Saunders, 
  1993). Even in cases in which these systems did not make landfall in the insular 
  Caribbean itself&#151;as with Hurricane Andrew, which devastated southern Florida 
  in the United States&#151;an increase in insurance premiums in the islands subsequently 
  occurred.</p>
<p>Certain traditional island assets (goods and services) also will be at risk 
  from climate change and sea-level rise. These assets include subsistence and 
  traditional technologies (skills and knowledge), community structure, and coastal 
  villages and settlements. Sea-level rise and climate changes, coupled with environmental 
  changes, have destroyed some very important and unique cultural and spiritual 
  sites, coastal protected areas, and traditional heritage sites in the Federated 
  States of Micronesia, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Niue, and Kiribati and continue 
  to threaten others (Kaluwin and Smith, 1997).</p>
<p>Although some of these assets fall into the category of nonmarket goods and 
  services, they are still considered to be of vital importance in small island 
  states. In Tuvalu, for instance (as in other Pacific atoll states), strong traditional 
  ties to land and sea constitute a vital component of local cosmology (Sem <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1996). Some of these values and traditions are compatible with modern 
  conservation and environmental practices; therefore, priority action is needed 
  in the following areas: research into traditional knowledge and practices of 
  conservation and environment control&#151;which have sustained these societies 
  for generations, even in the face of hazards, risk, and uncertainty; inventorying 
  of traditional, heritage, and other cultural sites; encouragement of practices 
  that marry use of modern science and technology with traditional wisdom; and 
  more effective transmission of traditional knowledge to younger generations.</p>
