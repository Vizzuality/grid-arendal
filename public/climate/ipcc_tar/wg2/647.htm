<h3>18.3.3. Models, Analogs, and Empirical Analysis of Autonomous Adaptation</h3>
<p>Adaptation to rapid anthropogenic climate change may be a new challenge, but 
  individuals, societies, and economies have adapted&#151;in various ways and 
  with various degrees of success&#151;to changed and variable environmental conditions 
  throughout history. These experiences in adaptive behavior provide information 
  on the processes, constraints, and consequences of adaptations. </p>
<p>Knowledge of the processes by which individuals or communities actually adapt 
  to changes in conditions over time comes largely from analog and other empirical 
  analyses (Wigley <i>et al.</i>, 1981; Glantz, 1996; Meyer <i>et al.</i>, 1998; 
  Tol <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Yohe and Dowlatabadi, 1999; 
  Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 2000). These studies indicate that autonomous adaptations 
  tend to be incremental and ad hoc, to take multiple forms, to be in response 
  to multiple stimuli (usually involving a particular catalyst and rarely climate 
  alone), and to be constrained by economic, social, technological, institutional, 
  and political conditions.</p>
<p>Conceptual models of adaptation processes describe sequential relationships 
  and feedback involving climatic and nonclimatic stimuli, system sensitivities 
  and impacts, tactical and strategic adaptations, and net or residual impacts. 
  They also indicate conditions that constrain or facilitate various kinds of 
  adaptation (e.g., Carter, 1996; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 1996; UNEP, 1998; Schneider 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Spatial analogs have been used to gain insight into adaptation, 
  by transferring experience from existing climatic regions to places where such 
  climate may be found in the future. The contributions and limits of spatial 
  analogs are known (Schneider, 1997; Rayner and Malone, 1998). Some ecological 
  and paleoecological studies reconstruct species or community dynamics over hundreds 
  and thousands of years (e.g., MacDonald <i>et al.</i>, 1993). </p>
<p>Temporal analog or case studies document adaptive responses to climatic stimuli 
  in resource-based economic sectors and communities over periods of several decades 
  (e.g., Glantz, 1988; Olsthoorn <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Changnon <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997). Other empirical analyses have examined adaptive behavior in key sectors 
  such as agriculture in light of climatic variability and extremes over even 
  shorter time periods (e.g., Appendi and Liverman, 1996; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997; Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>These direct empirical analyses of adaptation processes tend to start with 
  the system of interest, then assess its sensitivity and adaptability to climate 
  and other stimuli. This analytical strategy is consistent with vulnerability 
  assessment (Downing <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Adger, 1999; Handmer <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999; Kelly and Adger, 1999), the "adjoint approach" (Parry, 1986), 
  and "shift-in-risk" perspectives (Warrick <i>et al.</i>, 1986). These 
  studies have yielded some important insights about adaptation.</p>
<p>For systems such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, and coastal zone 
  settlements, the key climatic stimuli are not average conditions but variability 
  and extremes. A direct climatic condition prompts adaptation less often than 
  the economic and social effects or implications of the climatic stimuli that 
  are fundamental in triggering adaptive responses. Nonclimatic conditions are 
  important in moderating and sometimes overwhelming the influence of climate 
  stimuli in the decisionmaking of resource users. Decisions on adaptation are 
  rarely made in response to climate stimuli alone. These findings are important 
  for predicting autonomous adaptations and for improving adaptation assumptions 
  in impact models. </p>
<p>In estimating future adaptations and developing adaptation policies (see <a href="648.htm#184">Section 
  18.4</a>), it is helpful to understand factors and circumstances that hinder 
  or promote adaptation. As Rayner and Malone (1998) conclude, the consequences 
  of a climate event are not direct functions of its physical characteristics; 
  they also are functions of "the ways in which a society has organized its relation 
  to its resource base, its relations with other societies, and the relations 
  among its members." To understand vulnerability in archeological, historical, 
  and contemporary contexts, Rayner and Malone (1998) identify the most promising 
  research strategy:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>" &#133;explicitly to focus attention on the process of adaptation&#151;or, 
    on the other hand, of failure to adapt&#151;that partly condition the impact 
    of the climatic stress in particular societies&#133;cases in which societies 
    appear to have been seriously damaged by, or even totally succumbed to, climatic 
    stress should not be taken to demonstrate the determining influence of climate. 
    It is essential to consider ways in which these societies might have coped 
    better, and to focus on the political, cultural, and socioeconomic factors 
    which inhibited them from doing so" (Ingram <i>et al.</i>, 1981).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this approach, McGovern's (1991) reexamination of the extinction 
  of Greenland settlements found that the stress imposed by climate shifts was 
  indeed severe but was within the theoretical ability of the colonies to have 
  coped, by means that were available to them. Why they failed to employ those 
  adaptive means emerges as the key question, still incompletely answered, in 
  explaining the collapse: "It did get cold and they did die out, but why?" 
  (McGovern, 1991). Intervening between the physical events and the social consequences 
  is the adaptive capacity and hence vulnerability of the society and its different 
  groups and individual members.</p>

<h3>18.3.4. Costs of Autonomous Adaptation</h3>
<p>As assessments of climate impacts (commonly measured as "costs" that 
  include damages and benefits) increasingly have incorporated expected adaptations, 
  and particularly as impact models and "integrated assessment" models 
  have shown the potential of adaptation to offset initial impact costs, interest 
  has grown in calculating the costs of autonomous adaptations. Whether climate 
  change or another climate stimulus is expected to have problematic or "dangerous" 
  impacts depends on the adaptations and their costs (Leary, 1999). Climate change 
  impact cost studies that assume adaptation also should include the "adjustment 
  of costs" of these adaptations (Reilly, 1998).</p>
<p>Tol and Fankhauser (1997) provide a comprehensive summary of analyses of the 
  costs of autonomous, mainly (but not exclusively) reactive adaptations, undertaken 
  privately (i.e., not adaptation policies of government). A common basis for 
  evaluating impact costs is to sum adaptation costs and residual damage costs 
  (Fankhauser, 1996; Rothman <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Procedures for defining and 
  calculating such adaptation costs are subject to ongoing debate. Tol and Fankhauser 
  (1997) note that most approaches consider equilibrium adaptation costs but ignore 
  transition costs. Hurd <i>et al.</i> (1997) include market and nonmarket adaptation 
  in their assessment of impact costs. Most research to date on adaptation "costs" 
  is limited to particular economic measures of well-being (Brown, 1998). Any 
  comprehensive assessment of adaptation costs (including benefits) would consider 
  not only economic criteria but also social welfare and equity.</p>
<p>Cost estimation for autonomous adaptations is not only important for impact 
  assessment; it also is a necessary ingredient in the "base case," 
  "reference scenario," or "do-nothing option" for evaluations 
  of policy initiatives, with respect to both adaptation and mitigation (Rayner 
  and Malone, 1998; Leary, 1999; Smit <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
<a name="1835"></a>
<h3>18.3.5. Lessons from Adaptation Experiences</h3>
<p>Research in many sectors and regions indicates an impressive human capacity 
  to adapt to long-term mean climate conditions but less success in adapting to 
  extremes and to year-to-year variations in climatic conditions. Climate change 
  will be experienced via conditions that vary from year to year, as well as for 
  ecosystems (Sprengers <i>et al.</i>, 1994) and human systems (Downing <i>et al.</i>, 1996); 
  these variations are important for adaptation. Thus, although human settlements 
  and agricultural systems, for example, have adapted to be viable in a huge variety 
  of climatic zones around the world, those settlements and systems often are 
  vulnerable (with limited adaptive capacity) to temporal deviations from normal 
  conditions (particularly extremes). As a result, adaptations designed to address 
  changed mean conditions may or may not be helpful in coping with the variability 
  that is inherent in climate change. </p>
<p>All socioeconomic systems (especially climate-dependent systems such as agriculture, 
  pastoralism, forestry, water resources, and human health) are continually in 
  a state of flux in response to changing circumstances, including climatic conditions. 
  The evidence shows that there is considerable potential for adaptation to reduce 
  the impacts of climate change and to realize new opportunities. In China's 
  Yantze Valley, 18th-century regional expansions and contractions on the double-cropping 
  system for rice represented adaptive responses to the frequency of production 
  successes and failures associated with climatic variations (Smit and Cai, 1996). 
  Adaptation options occur generally in socioeconomic sectors and systems in which 
  the turnover of capital investment and operating costs is shorter and less often 
  where long-term investment is required (Yohe <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Although an impressive variety of adaptation initiatives have been undertaken 
  across sectors and regions, the responses are not universally or equally available 
  (Rayner and Malone, 1998). For example, the viability of crop insurance depends 
  heavily on the degree of information, organization, and subsidy available to 
  support it. Similarly, the option of changing location in the face of hazard 
  depends on the resources and mobility of the affected part and on the availability 
  and conditions in potential destination areas (McGregor, 1993). Many response 
  strategies have become less available; many others have become more available. 
  Individual cultivator response to climate risk in India has long relied on a 
  diverse mix of strategies, from land use to outside employment (sometimes requiring 
  temporary migration) to reciprocal obligations for support; many of these strategies 
  have been undermined by changes such as population pressure and government policy, 
  without being fully replaced by others&#151;illustrating the oft-remarked vulnerability 
  of regions and populations in transition (Gadgil <i>et al.</i>, 1988; Johda, 1989). 
  In areas of China, many historical adaptations in agriculture (e.g., relocating 
  production or employing irrigation) are no longer available as population pressures 
  increase on limited land and water resources (Fang and Liu, 1992; Cai and Smit, 
  1996). In Kenya, effective smallholder response to drought has shifted from 
  traditional planting strategies to employment diversification (Downing <i>et al.</i>, 
  1989).</p>
<p>Not only is there rarely only one adaptation option available to decisionmakers 
  (Burton and Cohen, 1993) but also "rarely do people choose the best responses&#151;the 
  ones among those available that would most effectively reduce losses&#151;often 
  because of an established preference for, or aversion to, certain options" 
  (Rayner and Malone, 1998). In some cases there is limited knowledge of risks 
  or alternative adaptation strategies. In other cases, adoption of adaptive measures 
  is constrained by other priorities, limited resources, or economic or institutional 
  barriers (Eele, 1996; Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 2000; de Lo&euml; and Kreutzwiser, 2000). 
  Recurrent vulnerabilities, in many cases with increasing damages, illustrate 
  less-than-perfect adaptation of systems to climatic variations and risks. There 
  is some evidence that the costs of adaptations to climate conditions are growing 
  (Burton, 1997; Etkin, 1998). There is strong evidence of a sharp increase in 
  damage costs of extreme climatic or weather events (Berz, 1999; Bruce, 1999). 
  Growing adaptation costs reflect, at least in part, increases in populations 
  and/or improvements in standards of living, with more disposable income being 
  used to improve levels of comfort, health, and safety in the short run. It is 
  not clear whether the expansion in adaptations is likely to be effective and 
  sustainable in the long run. In any event, although adaptations to changed and 
  variable climatic conditions are undertaken, they are not necessarily effective 
  or without costs.</p>
<p>Many adaptations to reduce vulnerability to climate change risks also reduce 
  vulnerability to current climate variability, extremes, and hazards (El Shaer 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Rayner and Malone, 1998). Measures that are likely to reduce current 
  sensitivity of climate variations in Africa also are likely to reduce the threat 
  of adverse impacts of climate change (Ominde and Juna, 1991):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" Most analysts in the less-developed countries believe that the urgent 
    need, in the face of both climate variation and prospective climate change, 
    is to identify policies which reduce recurrent vulnerability and increase 
    resilience. Prescriptions for reducing vulnerability span drought-proofing 
    the economy, stimulating economic diversification, adjusting land and water 
    uses, providing social support for dependent populations, and providing financial 
    instruments that spread the risk of adverse consequences form individual to 
    society and over longer periods. For the near term, development strategies 
    should ensure that livelihoods are resilient to a wide range of perturbations." 
    (Rayner and Malone, 1998)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of current adaptation strategies in agriculture with clear applications 
  to climate change are given by Easterling (1996) and Smit <i>et al.</i> (1997), including 
  moisture-conserving practices, hybrid selection, and crop substitution. In the 
  water resources sector, Stakhiv (1996) shows how current management practices 
  represent useful adaptive strategies for climate change. Some analysts go further 
  to point out that certain adaptations to climate change not only address current 
  hazards but may be additionally beneficial for other reasons (e.g., "no 
  regrets" or "win-win" strategies) (Carter, 1996).</p>
<p>Societal responses to large environmental challenges tend to be incremental 
  and ad hoc rather than fundamental (Rayner and Malone, 1998). In all of the 
  climate analog cases examined by Glantz (1988), "Ad hoc responses were 
  favored over long term planned responses. As a result, there has been a tendency 
  to &#145;muddle through.' This has not necessarily been an inappropriate 
  response, but it is probably more costly in the long term than putting a long-term 
  strategy together in order to cope with climate-related environmental change." 
  In each case, moreover, action was not taken without a catalyst or trigger that 
  dramatically indicated the seriousness of a threat (Glantz, 1988). Other studies 
  also indicate the ad hoc nature of adaptations and the importance of a catalyst 
  (Wilhite <i>et al.</i>, 1986; Glantz, 1992; Kasperson <i>et al.</i>, 1995). These findings 
  suggest that problems that demand early or long-term attention often fail to 
  receive it, and the most efficient responses are not taken. That the earlier 
  action would have been more efficacious, however, presupposes that the best 
  strategy was evident to the decisionmakers and that premature responses closing 
  off useful options would not have been taken instead (Rayner and Malone, 1998). 
  There is little evidence that efficient and effective adaptations to climate 
  change risks will be undertaken autonomously. </p>
<p>A consistent lesson from adaptation research is that climate is not the singular 
  driving force of human affairs that is sometimes assumed&#151;but neither is 
  it a trivial factor. Climate is an important resource for human activities and 
  an important hazard. Climate change is a source of significant stresses (and 
  perhaps significant opportunities) for societies, yet it has always been only 
  one factor among many. The consequences of a shift in climate are not calculable 
  from the physical dimensions of the shift alone; they require attention to human 
  dimensions through which they are experienced (Rayner and Malone, 1998; Bryant 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). The significance of climate change for regions depends fundamentally 
  on the ability and likelihood of those regions to adapt. </p>
<p>To what degree are societies likely to adapt autonomously to avoid climate 
  change damages? Some studies show faith in market mechanisms and suggest considerable 
  capacity of human systems to adapt autonomously (Ausabel, 1991b; Mendelsohn 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Yohe <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mendelsohn, 1998; Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999). 
  Other studies highlight the constraints on "optimal" autonomous adaptation, 
  such as limited information and access to resources, adaptation costs, and residual 
  damages; these studies emphasize the need for planned, especially anticipatory, 
  adaptations undertaken or facilitated by public agencies (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1996; 
  Reilly, 1998; Tol, 1998a; Fankhauser <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Bryant <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Schneider 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000)<br>
