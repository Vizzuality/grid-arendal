<h4><a name="16264"></a>16.2.6.4. Sensitivity of Arctic Ocean to River Flow</h4>
<p>Increased future melting from the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic glaciers and 
  ice caps has potential to increase significantly freshwater runoff to the northern 
  circumpolar seas on time scales as short as decades. Combined with changes in 
  Arctic runoff, there will be an effect on Arctic sea ice. Freshwater input to 
  the Arctic Ocean is important for growth, duration, and melt of sea ice, particularly 
  on the large, shallow continental shelf areas that constitute 30% of the area 
  of the Arctic basin. Spreading over the ocean of lower density freshwater from 
  summer runoff, together with sinking of denser brine rejected during autumn 
  and winter sea-ice production, maintain characteristic salinity and temperature 
  layering. This leads to the Arctic halocline&#151;a cold, salt-stratified layer 
  that separates the upper mixed layer from underlying warm saline waters. The 
  strength and position of surface and deep currents in the slope water south 
  of Newfoundland are thought to vary as a coupled system in relation to the dipole 
  in atmospheric sea-level pressure known as the NAO (Keigwin and Pickart, 1999). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Overall, runoff to the Arctic Ocean is approximately 3-4 x 103 km<sup>3</sup> 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Prowse and Flegg, 2000)&#151;twice that produced by precipitation 
  minus evaporation for the Arctic Ocean or the influx of low-salinity ocean water 
  (Barry and Serreze, 2000). Export of freshwater (as low-salinity water and sea 
  ice) from the Arctic Ocean into the North Atlantic couples northern latitudes 
  to the world thermohaline circulation. <br>
</p>
<p>Almost 70% of the total runoff to the Arctic Ocean is provided by four rivers: 
  the Ob, Yenisey, and Lena in Russia and the Mackenzie in Canada. The three Russian 
  rivers have flow measurements dating back to the 1930s, whereas the Mackenzie 
  record begins only in 1972. Although there is no significant long-term trend 
  in flow for these rivers, there has been a slight increase in runoff beginning 
  in the late-1970s for other rivers in European Russia and western Siberia, with 
  some dependence on season (Georgievskii <i>et al</i>., 1996; Georgievskii, 1998; Grabs 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Shiklomanov <i>et al</i>., 2000). Shiklomanov <i>et al</i>. (2000) found that 
  historical temperature shifts of -0.5 to +1.0&deg;C had little effect on river 
  inflows to the Arctic Ocean, which remained within 3-5% of their long-term 
  average. <br>
</p>
<p>For a range of future climate scenarios, results from hydrological routines 
  embedded in climate models and from independent hydrological models that are 
  driven by climate model output indicate that discharge from the major Arctic 
  rivers will increase significantly (Miller and Russell, 1992; Shiklomanov, 1994; 
  van Blarcum <i>et al</i>., 1995; Shiklomanov, 1997; Hagemann and D&uuml;menil, 
  1998; Lewis <i>et al</i>., 2000). Mackenzie basin studies, however, have projected 
  some reduction in streamflow as a result of expected climate warming (MBIS, 
  1997). Summarizing the general results, Shiklomanov <i>et al</i>. (2000) note 
  that with an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> doubling, total annual inflow to the Arctic Ocean 
  will increase by 10-20%, with a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase during winter, 
  although most of the flow still will occur in summer. Such predictions must 
  be treated cautiously, however, because most climate models have been found 
  to overestimate Arctic precipitation and simulate soil moisture and evaporation 
  poorly (Robock <i>et al</i>., 1998; Walsh <i>et al</i>., 1998). Uncertainty 
  in hydrological modeling of high-latitude river systems must be resolved before 
  the risk of changes to the Arctic Ocean freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation 
  can be quantified accurately (Carmack, 2000; Prowse and Flegg, 2000).</p>
