<h3>5.7.4. Adaptation Options</h3>
<p>Human responses to climate change could further exacerbate the negative impact 
  on aquatic ecological systems. For example, human responses to a warmer climate 
  and the variety of precipitation scenarios, as well as human population increases, 
  are likely to place greater demands on freshwaters to meet water needs for drinking, 
  industry, and irrigation, along with an increase in water management projects 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Potential results would include fewer 
  free-flowing streams and greater fluctuations in water level. These changes 
  would cause a loss of ecosystem services and products from "natural/ unmodified" 
  lakes and streams. Conflicts between developers and those wishing to reduce 
  development pressure on lakes and streams probably would intensify as freshwater 
  becomes either more scarce or more abundant.</p>
<p>One adaptation to climate change would entail poleward transportation of fish, 
  mollusks, and other less vagil organisms across watershed boundaries to cooler 
  waters (Magnuson et al., 1997). Historical introductions and range expansions 
  of species have resulted in extinction or extirpation of preexisting fauna owing 
  to ecological interactions, especially predation by the invader. Well-known 
  examples include the sea lamprey, alewife, smelt, and zebra mussel to the Laurentian 
  Great Lakes in North America (Mills et al., 1994); the peacock bass in Panama 
  (Zaret and Paine, 1973); and the Nile perch into Lake Victoria (Kaufman, 1992). 
  Other examples being documented include the decline or extirpation of cisco 
  and yellow perch in small Wisconsin lakes in the United States with the arrival 
  of rainbow smelt (Hrabik et al., 1998) and the loss of cyprinids (minnows) and 
  the decline of lake trout with the introduction of black bass and rockbass into 
  Ontario lakes in Canada (Casselman, 2000; Jackson, 2000; Vander Zanden, 2000). 
  The history of invasions exemplifies the homogenization of continental faunas 
  (Rahel, 2000), losses in native organisms, and large changes in ecosystem processes 
  and structure&#151;all with economic consequences. </p>
<p>Fisheries (capture, aquaculture, and recreational) and associated introductions 
  would exacerbate biodiversity and exotic problems in a warming climate. A substantial 
  number of inland fisheries are associated with introduced species and stock 
  enhancement. Tilapia, carp, grass carp, and rainbow trout are commonly introduced 
  or stocked. An estimated 38% of the recreational catch is of non-native fishes. 
  The practice of introducing species apparently has resulted in 1,354 introductions 
  of 237 species into 140 countries from pre-1900 to the mid-1980s (FAO, 1988). 
  Despite recognition of the importance of wild native species and increasing 
  appreciation of the importance of biodiversity, impacts of climate change are 
  likely to be managed by introducing better adapted species, if past management 
  practices prevail. In the United States, an average of 38% of the recreational 
  fishery is for non-native species, 75% of which now reproduce naturally (Horak, 
  1995). As climate change impacts affect the abundance of native (and non-native) 
  species, it is probable that the past precedent of introducing non-native species 
  would be applied to maintaining catches and recreational fishing stability.</p>
<p>Moving species poleward to adapt to changing climate zones for lakes and streams 
  is fraught with scientific uncertainties and human conflict. The exotic can 
  become a superabundant pest species, with negative effects on native organisms&#151;including 
  extirpation and extinction. The invasion ecology of organisms is not a predictive 
  science; many surprises would be expected. The case has been made that managing 
  with exotics increases the instability of the fish community and fish management 
  problems and includes many unexpected consequences (Magnuson, 1976). Introduction 
  of warmer water fauna on top of regional fauna that are having increasing problems 
  from warming climates is likely to be a controversial adaptation.</p>
<p>Climate changes may provide development opportunities for aquaculture if traditional 
  wild fisheries are less stable and markets favor the stability of the aquaculture 
  product. Aquaculture represents a mobile technology that potentially can move 
  with changing climate to the best conditions for culture (see <a href="261.htm#fig57">Figure 
  5-7</a>).</p>
