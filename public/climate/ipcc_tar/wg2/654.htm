        <li>Water managers have experience adapting to change. Many techniques 
          exist to assess and implement adaptive options. However, the pervasiveness 
          of climate change may preclude some traditional adaptive strategies, 
          and available adaptations often are not used.</li>
        <li>Adaptation can involve management on the supply side (e.g., altering 
          infrastructure or institutional arrangements) and on the demand side 
          (changing demand or risk reduction). Numerous no-regret policies exist 
          that will generate net social benefits regardless of climate change.</li>
        <li>Climate change is just one of numerous pressures facing water managers. 
          Nowhere are water management decisions taken solely to cope with climate 
          change, although it is increasingly considered for future resource management. 
          Some vulnerabilities are outside the conventional responsibility of 
          water managers.</li>
        <li>Estimates of the economic costs of climate change impacts on water 
          resources depend strongly on assumptions made about adaptation. Economically 
          optimum adaptation may be prevented by constraints associated with uncertainty, 
          institutions, and equity.</li>
        <li>Extreme events often are catalysts for changes in water management, 
          by exposing vulnerabilities and raising awareness of climate risks. 
          Climate change modifies indicators of extremes and variability, complicating 
          adaptation decisions.</li>
        <li>Ability to adapt is affected by institutional capacity, wealth, management 
          philosophy, planning time scale, organizational and legal framework, 
          technology, and population mobility.</li>
        <li>Water managers need research and management tools aimed at adapting 
          to uncertainty and change, rather than improving climate scenarios.</li>

        <li>Coastal adaptation entails more than just selecting one of the technical 
          options to respond to sea-level rise (strategies can aim to protect, 
          accommodate, or retreat). It is a complex and iterative process rather 
          than a simple choice.</li>
        <li>Adaptation options are more acceptable and effective when they are 
          incorporated into coastal zone management, disaster mitigation programs, 
          land-use planning, and sustainable development strategies.</li>
        <li>Adaptation choices will be conditioned by existing policies and development 
          objectives, requiring researchers and policymakers to work toward a 
          commonly acceptable framework for adaptation.</li>
        <li>The adaptive capacity of coastal systems to perturbations is related 
          to coastal resilience, which has morphological, ecological, and socioeconomic 
          components. Enhancing resilience&#151;including the technical, institutional, 
          economic, and cultural capability to cope with impacts&#151;is a particularly

          low exposure or high adaptive capacity will be least affected. Communities 
          with less economic resources, poorer infrastructure, less developed 
          communications and transportation systems, and weak social support systems

          changes will increase the need for explicit adaptation strategies. In 
          some cases, adaptation may yield net benefits, especially if climate 
          change is slow.</li>
        <li>Stakeholders in most sectors believe that technology is available 
          to adapt, although at some social and economic cost.</li>
        <li>Adaptation is expected to be more successful in agriculture and forestry. 
          However, adaptations for the water, health, food, and energy sectors 
          and the cities are likely to require substantial institutional and infrastructure 
          changes.</li>
        <li>In the water sector, adaptations to seasonal runoff changes include 
          storage, conjunctive supply management, and transfer. It may not be 
          possible to continue current high levels of reliability of water supply, 
          especially with transfers to high-valued uses. Adaptive measures such 
          as "water markets" may lead to concerns about accessibility 
          and conflicts over allocation priorities.</li>
        <li>Adaptations such as levees and dams often are successful in managing 
          most variations in the weather but can increase vulnerability to the 
          most extreme events.</li>
        <li>There is moderate potential for adaptation through conservation programs 
          that protect particularly threatened ecosystems, such as high alpines 
          and wetlands. It may be difficult or impossible to offset adverse impacts 
          on aquatic systems.<br>

        <li>Adaptation will occur in natural polar ecosystems through migration

        <li>The need for adaptation has become increasingly urgent, even if swift 
          implementation of global agreements to reduce future emissions occurs.</li>
        <li>Most adaptation will be carried out by people and communities who 
          inhabit island countries; support from governments is essential for 
          implementing adaptive measures.</li>
        <li>Progress will require integration of appropriate risk-reduction strategies 
          with other sectoral policy initiatives in areas such as sustainable 
          development planning, disaster prevention and management, integrated 
          coastal zone management, and health care planning.</li>
        <li>Strategies for adaptation to sea-level rise are retreat, accommodate, 
          and protect. Measures such as retreat to higher ground, raising of the 
          land, and use of building set-backs appear to have little practical 
          utility, especially when hindered by limited physical size.</li>
        <li>Measures for reducing the severity of health threats include health 
          education programs, improved health care facilities, sewerage and solid 
          waste management, and disaster preparedness plans.</li>
        <li>Islanders have developed some capacity to adapt by application of 
          traditional knowledge, locally appropriate technology, and customary 
          practice. Overall, however, adaptive capacity is low because of the 
          physical size of nations, limited access to capital and technology, 
          shortage of human resource skills, lack of tenure security, overcrowding, 
          and limited access to resources for construction.</li>
        <li>Many small islands require external financial, technical, and other 
          assistance to adapt. Adaptive capacity may be enhanced by regional cooperation 
          and pooling of limited resources.</li>

<p>Increasingly, adaptation and adaptive capacity are explicitly considered in 
  impact and vulnerability assessments, and there are some consistent findings 
  across sectors and regions (see <a href="655.htm#188">Section 18.8</a>). However, 
  there is insufficient basis to rank systematically countries according to their 
  adaptive capacity or to list the "most vulnerable" overall. Analyses to date 
  indicate that adaptive capacity and vulnerability are multidimensional, so that 
  one country (or, more often, a group within a country) may be extremely vulnerable 
  economically whereas another country (or community) is extremely vulnerable 
  in terms of life and livelihood. These different types of vulnerability reflect 
  different types of exposures and adaptive capacities. <br>
