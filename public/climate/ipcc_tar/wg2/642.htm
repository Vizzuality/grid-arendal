<h1><a name="21"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<i>Adaptation</i> refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems 
in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. 
It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential 
damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change. 
<p>Estimates of likely future adaptations are an essential ingredient in <i>impact 
  and vulnerability assessments</i>. The extent to which ecosystems, food supplies, 
  and sustainable development are vulnerable or "in danger" depends 
  both on exposure to changes in climate and on the ability of the impacted system 
  to adapt. In addition, adaptation is an important policy <i>response</i> option, 
  along with mitigation. There is a need for the development and assessment of 
  planned adaptation initiatives to help manage the risks of climate change. </p>
<p>Adaptations vary according to the system in which they occur, who undertakes 
  them, the climatic stimuli that prompts them, and their timing, functions, forms, 
  and effects. In unmanaged natural systems, adaptation is autonomous and reactive; 
  it is the process by which species and ecosystems respond to changed conditions. 
  This chapter focuses on adaptations consciously undertaken by humans, including 
  those in economic sectors, managed ecosystems, resource use systems, settlements, 
  communities, and regions. In human systems, adaptation is undertaken by private 
  decisionmakers and by public agencies or governments.</p>
<p>Adaptation depends greatly on the <i>adaptive capacity</i> or adaptability 
  of an affected system, region, or community to cope with the impacts and risks 
  of climate change. The adaptive capacity of communities is determined by their 
  socioeconomic characteristics. Enhancement of adaptive capacity represents a 
  practical means of coping with changes and uncertainties in climate, including 
  variability and extremes. In this way, enhancement of adaptive capacity reduces 
  vulnerabilities and promotes sustainable development.</p>
<p><i>Adaptation to climate change has the potential to substantially reduce many 
  of the adverse impacts of climate change and enhance beneficial impacts&#151;though 
  neither without cost nor without leaving residual damage. </i></p>
<p><i>The key features of climate change for vulnerability and adaptation are 
  those related to variability and extremes, not simply changed average conditions.</i> 
  Most sectors and regions and communities are reasonably adaptable to changes 
  in average conditions, particularly if they are gradual. However, these communities 
  are more vulnerable and less adaptable to changes in the frequency and/or magnitude 
  of conditions other than average, especially extremes. </p>
<p><i>Sectors and regions will tend to adapt autonomously to changes in climate 
  conditions.</i> Human systems have evolved a wide range of strategies to cope 
  with climatic risks; these strategies have potential applications to climate 
  change vulnerabilities. However, losses from climatic variations and extremes 
  are substantial and, in some sectors, increasing. These losses indicate that 
  autonomous adaptation has not been sufficient to offset damages associated with 
  temporal variations in climatic conditions. The ecological, social, and economic 
  costs of relying on reactive, autonomous adaptation to the cumulative effects 
  of climate change are substantial. </p>
<p><i>Planned anticipatory adaptation has the potential to reduce vulnerability 
  and realize opportunities associated with climate change, regardless of autonomous 
  adaptation.</i> Implementation of adaptation policies, programs, and measures 
  usually will have immediate benefits, as well as future benefits. Adaptation 
  measures are likely to be implemented only if they are consistent with or integrated 
  with decisions or programs that address nonclimatic stresses. The costs of adaptation 
  often are marginal to other management or development costs. </p>
<p><i>The capacity to adapt varies considerably among regions, countries, and 
  socioeconomic groups and will vary over time.</i> The most vulnerable regions 
  and communities are those that are highly exposed to hazardous climate change 
  effects and have limited adaptive capacity. Countries with limited economic 
  resources, low levels of technology, poor information and skills, poor infrastructure, 
  unstable or weak institutions, and inequitable empowerment and access to resources 
  have little capacity to adapt and are highly vulnerable. </p>
<p><i>Enhancement of adaptive capacity is a necessary condition for reducing vulnerability, 
  particularly for the most vulnerable regions, nations, and socioeconomic groups.</i> 
  Activities required for the enhancement of adaptive capacity are essentially 
  equivalent to those promoting sustainable development. Climate adaptation and 
  equity goals can be jointly pursued by initiatives that promote the welfare 
  of the poorest members of society&#151;for example, by improving food security, 
  facilitating access to safe water and health care, and providing shelter and 
  access to other resources. Development decisions, activities, and programs play 
  important roles in modifying the adaptive capacity of communities and regions, 
  yet they tend not to take into account risks associated with climate variability 
  and change. Inclusion of climatic risks in the design and implementation of 
  development initiatives is necessary to reduce vulnerability and enhance sustainability. 
</p>
<p><i>Current knowledge of adaptation and adaptive capacity is insufficient for 
  reliable prediction of adaptations; it also is insufficient for rigorous evaluation 
  of planned adaptation options, measures, and policies of governments.</i> Climate 
  change vulnerability studies now usually consider adaptation, but they rarely 
  go beyond identifying adaptation options that might be possible; there is little 
  research on the dynamics of adaptation in human systems, the processes of adaptation 
  decisionmaking, conditions that stimulate or constrain adaptation, and the role 
  of nonclimatic factors. There are serious limitations in existing evaluations 
  of adaptation options: Economic benefits and costs are important criteria but 
  are not sufficient to adequately determine the appropriateness of adaptation 
  measures; there also has been little research to date on the roles and responsibilities 
  in adaptation of individuals, communities, corporations, private and public 
  institutions, governments, and international organizations. Given the scope 
  and variety of specific adaptation options across sectors, individuals, communities, 
  and locations, as well as the variety of participants&#151;private and public&#151;involved 
  in most adaptation initiatives, it is probably infeasible to systematically 
  evaluate lists of particular adaptation measures; improving and applying knowledge 
  on the constraints and opportunities for enhancing adaptive capacity is necessary 
  to reduce vulnerabilities associated with climate change.</p>
