<h4>3.2.3.4. Time Horizons </h4>
<p>The appropriate time horizon for socioeconomic scenarios depends on the use 
  to which they are put. Climate modelers often use scenarios that look forward 
  100 years or more. Socioeconomic scenarios with similar time horizons may be 
  needed to drive models of climate change, climate impacts, and land-use change. 
  However, policymakers also may wish to use socioeconomic scenarios as decision 
  tools in framing current policies for climate change adaptation. In this context, 
  time horizons on the order of 20 years may be more appropriate, reflecting the 
  immediate needs of decisionmakers.</p>
<p>Short-term socioeconomic scenarios can still be very uncertain. "Surprises" 
  such as economic slumps or booms, wars, or famines frequently occur in social 
  and economic systems. Over the course of 50-100 years, even the most basic 
  scenario drivers, such as population and aggregate economic activity, are highly 
  uncertain, and their future development can be projected with any credibility 
  only by using alternative scenarios. Moreover, technologies will have been replaced 
  at least once, and those in use 100 years hence could have unimagined effects 
  on climate sensitivity and vulnerability. Politically led developments in local, 
  regional, and international systems of governance also will unfold along unpredictable 
  paths. </p>
<h4><a name="3235"></a>3.2.3.5. Spatial Resolution</h4>
<p>Global emissions scenarios form the framework for predicting climate change 
  and variability impacts at the national level. To assess vulnerability and adaptation 
  potential, national scenarios must account for biophysical and socioeconomic 
  impacts. The potential for autonomous adaptations must be understood, reflecting 
  the ability of nature and society to cope with climate change and climate variability. 
  Many of the impacts of climate change on the coping ability of human systems 
  are likely to be location-specific. Impact assessors therefore should make use 
  of local/regional scenarios, where appropriate, and be wary of generalizing 
  experiences from one location to another. Matching of regional scenarios may 
  be difficult, however&#151;for example, if data on population and land use are 
  available at different levels of resolution.</p>
<h4><a name="3236"></a>3.2.3.6. Sectoral Scenarios</h4>
<p>As illustrated in <a href="127.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a>, scenario exercises 
  often make specific assumptions about individual sectors. These sectors usually 
  are chosen because they are considered particularly sensitive to climate change 
  (e.g., water, agriculture/food) or because they are important sources or sinks 
  for GHGs (e.g., energy, forestry). Detailed quantitative assumptions often are 
  made about levels of future economic activity or the price of key commodities, 
  which will influence adaptation strategies.</p>
<p>Formal modeling work generally is used to improve the detail, coherence, and 
  internal consistency of socioeconomic variables that are susceptible to quantification. 
  Expert judgment or stakeholder consultations may be used to build consensus 
  around the characterization of more subjective and less quantifiable variables 
  that relate to values and institutions. Stakeholder engagement also can provide 
  a wealth of local expertise about specific impacts and vulnerabilities.</p>
