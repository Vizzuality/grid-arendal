<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p>Climate change will affect human settlements against a very dynamic background 
  of other environmental and socioeconomic factors. Human settlements are expected 
  to be among the sectors that could be most easily adapted to climate change, 
  given appropriate planning and foresight and appropriate technical, institutional, 
  and political capacity. This chapter covers the same general topic areas as 
  Chapters 11 and 12 of the Second Assessment Report (SAR); however, this chapter 
  analyzes a wider variety of settlement types, provides a specific assessment 
  of uncertainty and confidence in findings and adaptive capacity in human settlements, 
  and places much of the discussion in a context of development, sustainability, 
  and equity (DSE) (see Munasinghe, 2000). Energy and industry are treated as 
  part of settlements. <a href="#fig71">Figure 7-1</a> characterizes the conclusions 
  of this chapter on two dimensions: scientific support (evidence available in 
  the literature to support the finding) and consensus in that literature. Both 
  scales are described more fully in Box 1-1 of Chapter 1 and in Moss and Schneider 
  (2000). </p>
<h4>Major Effects on Human Settlements </h4>
<p>Infrastructure would have increased vulnerability to urban flooding and landslides 
  (established but incomplete). Detailed modeling of rainfall event frequency 
  and intensity in the context of global warming has been linked to increased 
  intensity and frequency of urban flooding, with considerable damage to infrastructure 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a>, <a href="321.htm">8</a>, and <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="545.htm">15</a>). 
  Although not definitive for any part of the world, the model-based analysis 
  is plausible and demonstrates that flooding could be an increased threat for 
  riverine settlements under climate change. More predictable is loss of snow 
  pack in many regions, combined with more winter flooding. Landslides are a current 
  threat in many hilly areas and could be more so with more intense rainfall events.</p>

<p><a name="fig71"></a>Tropical cyclones would be more destructive under climate 
  change (established but incomplete). Close behind floods and landslides are 
  tropical cyclones (hurricanes or typhoons), which could have higher peak intensity 
  in a warmer world with warmer oceans (see <a href="122.htm">Chapters 3</a> and 
  <a href="321.htm">8</a>, and <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>). Tropical cyclones combine the effects of heavy rainfall, high winds, 
  storm surge, and sea-level rise in coastal areas and can be disruptive far inland 
  but are not as universally distributed as floods and landslides. </p>
<p>Water supplies for human settlements would be vulnerable to increased warming, 
  dryness, and flooding (established but incomplete). There is reasonable consensus 
  among experts that settlements in regions of the world that already are water-deficient 
  (e.g., much of north Africa, the Middle East, southwest Asia, portions of western 
  North America, and some Pacific islands) would face still higher demands for 
  water with a warmer climate, with no obvious low-cost ways in which to obtain 
  increased physical supplies. Observations on current water supply balances tend 
  to back up this conclusion (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="491.htm">13</a>). 
  However, theory and model output, though consistent with this view, are too 
  weak quantitatively to offer much support, especially for urban areas. Repeated 
  flooding also could create water quality problems in other areas. </p>
<p>Fire danger in settlements could increase with climate change (speculative 
  for resource-dependent settlements; established but incomplete for infrastructure). 
  Examples include forested and wildland/urban fringes in boreal regions (e.g., 
  Canada, Alaska, Russia) and in Mediterranean climates in both hemispheres (e.g., 
  California, southern Spain and France, and Australia) that could be affected 
  (see <a href="411.htm">Chapters 11</a>, <a href="463.htm">12</a>, <a href="491.htm">13</a>, 
  and <a href="545.htm">15</a>). Although general circulation model (GCM)-projected 
  summer climate in many regions looks similar to the hot, dry "fire weather" 
  in many warm years of recent memory and economic activity in forests sometimes 
  is restricted to reduce fire danger, impacts on the resource base have not been 
  demonstrated, research has not shown what future fuel loadings would be, and 
  it is unclear whether future economic activity and settlement infrastructure 
  would be more vulnerable to fire. </p>
<p>Hail and windstorm could cause more damage to settlements (speculative). Although 
  there is potential for more (and more severe) extreme weather episodes in a 
  warmer atmosphere, modeling and data have not demonstrated a higher incidence 
  of storms or of more severe storms (see <a href="122.htm">Chapters 3</a>, <a href="321.htm">8</a>, 
  <a href="463.htm">12</a>, and <a href="545.htm">15</a>). </p>
<p> Agroindustry and artisanal fisheries are sensitive to and in many cases vulnerable 
  to climate change (well-established overall; competing explanations in specific 
  regions). This conclusion dates back to the First Assessment Report (FAR). Additional 
  studies and analysis conducted in the past 10 years have modified the details 
  of the conclusion but have not overturned it. As described in Chapter 5, agriculture 
  itself is sensitive to climate change. In some cases, yields may be reduced 
  by as much as several tens of percent as a result of hotter weather, greater 
  evaporation, and lower precipitation in mid-continental growing regions in particular. 
  However, other regions may benefit, with higher yields possible. Impacts on 
  agricultural processors and suppliers would tend to follow the impacts on agriculture 
  itself. Changes in ocean conditions from El Niño episodes have demonstrated 
  that changes such as ocean warming have substantial impacts on the locations 
  and types of species available for fisheries, especially artisanal fisheries, 
  but other regions could benefit (see <a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a>, <a href="283.htm">6</a>, 
  and <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). </p>
<p>Heat waves would have more serious effects on human health and productivity 
  (competing explanations). The impact of heat waves is most severe on the weakest 
  parts of the populations (old, chronically ill, very young) that are not acclimated, 
  but effects on future overall death rates are less clear (see <a href="347.htm">Chapters 
  9</a>, <a href="411.htm">11</a>, <a href="491.htm">13</a>, <a href="516.htm">14</a>, 
  and <a href="545.htm">15</a>). Because anthropogenic warming is projected to 
  be greater at night than during the day, it would deprive sufferers of nighttime 
  relief. Projections for several temperate climates show increased risk of severe 
  heat waves (<a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). As the weather becomes very warm, 
  economic productivity of unprotected and outdoor populations declines. </p>
<p>Sea-level rise increases the cost/vulnerability of infrastructure and coastal 
  resource-based industry (well-established for infrastructure; established but 
  incomplete for resources). Although the amount of sea-level rise to be expected 
  as a result of global warming by any given date and in any given location is 
  uncertain, some studies are beginning to discuss likely ranges and probability 
  distributions (e.g., Titus and Narayanan, 1995). The sensitivity of human infrastructure 
  in coastal zones to given levels of sea-level rise is backed by theory, model 
  results, and data on current rates of increase. In addition, several industries-such 
  as tourism and recreation (the principal industry in many island economies)-are 
  dependent on coastal resources (see <a href="283.htm">Chapters 6</a>, <a href="321.htm">8</a>, 
  and <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). Effective types of adaptive 
  responses also are known in some circumstances, but vulnerability with adaptation 
  is difficult to assess because the capacity and will to respond are uncertain 
  or in doubt in many instances. </p>
<p>Energy demand in some locations is sensitive, and parts of the supply system 
  are vulnerable (well-established). Modeling, theory, data, and expert opinion 
  all say that warming of 1-5ºC would considerably reduce the amount of energy 
  that would be needed to heat buildings at mid- and high latitudes and altitudes, 
  whereas cooling energy use would increase (see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="545.htm">15</a> 
  and <a href="619.htm">17</a>). The net overall impact on energy use would depend 
  on local circumstances. If temperature increases take place primarily at night 
  and during winter months, heating demand would be smaller and the increase in 
  demand for energy for cooling and irrigation would be somewhat smaller than 
  otherwise. Future climate is expected to include more intense rainfall events 
  (which would require more conservative water storage strategies to prevent flood 
  damage), greater probability of water deficits (less hydroelectric production), 
  and less precipitation falling as snow (less water available during warm months) 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). All three factors point to less (or, 
  at least, less flexible) hydroelectric capacity at current powerhouses. Reduced 
  flows in rivers and higher temperatures reduce the capabilities of thermal electric 
  generation, and high temperatures may reduce transmission capabilities as well. 
</p>
<p>There will be increased air and water pollution impacts (competing explanations). 
  Climate change could contribute to water pollution problems in human settlements 
  through drought or flooding, although not by simple increases in flow (which 
  offers more dilution for pollutants). If droughts and floods become more frequent 
  (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>), so would instances of poor water quality 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a>, <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="545.htm">15</a>, 
  and <a href="619.htm">17</a>). Air pollution could be exacerbated if climate 
  change alters the stability of air sheds and permits greater buildup of atmospheric 
  pollutants (see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="545.htm">15</a>). 
  However, the outcomes remain largely theoretical, unsupported by data or modeling. 
</p>
<p>Infrastructure in permafrost regions is vulnerable to warming (well-established). 
  Data from circumpolar regions and model results suggest that permafrost areas 
  would see some melting of permafrost. Permafrost melting is a threat to infrastructure 
  in these regions because of increased landslides and loss of foundation stability 
  for structures, as well as increased damage from freeze-thaw cycles, among other 
  impacts. In addition, melting permafrost is thought to be a source of methane 
  (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gases (see <a href="545.htm">Chapters 
  15</a> and <a href="592.htm">16</a>). </p>
<p>Heat island effects could increase heat stress, increase summer energy demand, 
  and reduce winter energy demand (competing explanations). As discussed in <a href="122.htm">Chapters 
  3</a> and <a href="347.htm">9</a>, heat waves may increase in frequency and 
  severity in a warmer world, leading directly to increases in mortality among 
  sensitive populations that are not acclimated. Heat island effects exacerbate 
  the oppressive effects of heat waves by increasing temperatures experienced 
  in the summer by up to several °C; at the same time, increased demand for air 
  conditioning increases the demand for electricity and the severity of the heat 
  island itself through thermal electric production. Winter energy use for heating 
  would be reduced by the same phenomenon (see <a href="411.htm">Chapters 11</a>, 
  <a href="491.htm">13</a>, <a href="516.htm">14</a>, and <a href="545.htm">15</a>). 
  Effects in specific regions are far less clear. </p>
<h4>Other Observations </h4>
<p>Local capacity is critical to successful adaptation (well-established). Adaptation 
  means local tuning of settlements to a changing environment, not just warmer 
  temperatures. Urban experts are unanimous that successful environmental adaptation 
  cannot occur without locally based, technically and institutionally competent, 
  and politically supported leadership. Local adaptive capacity generally is strongly 
  correlated with the wealth, human capital, and institutional strength of the 
  settlement. In addition, capacity depends in part on the settlement's access 
  to national resources. Attempts to impose environmental solutions on settlements 
  from the international or national level frequently have been maladapted to 
  local circumstances. The most effective sustainable solutions are strongly supported 
  and often developed locally, with technical assistance and institutional support 
  from higher level bodies (see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>, <a href="411.htm">11</a>, 
  <a href="516.htm">14</a>, <a href="619.htm">17</a>, and <a href="641.htm">18</a>). 
</p>
<p>Nonclimate effects are likely to be more important than climate change (competing 
  explanations). The effects of climate change would occur against a background 
  of other socioeconomic and environmental change that is itself very uncertain 
  and complex (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Model results, the current 
  rate of environmental change, and economic theory all suggest that climate would 
  be a relatively small additional uncertainty for most human settlements. Climate 
  change in isolation also is unlikely to be as important a factor for DSE effects 
  as other aspects of development, such as economic and technological change. 
  In combination with other stresses from other processes such as population growth, 
  however, climate change is likely to exacerbate total stresses in a multi-stress 
  context. Particularly important could be effects of climate change on equity 
  because relatively advantaged parts of global and local societies are likely 
  to have better coping capacities than less advantaged parts. </p>
<p>Managing growth to ensure that it is sustainable and equitably distributed 
  currently is a greater problem for most countries than the impacts of climate 
  change. However, some experts are not in agreement on this point for the future, 
  pointing out that the economic models do not show climate feedback to the economy 
  and that climate effects are so uncertain that they could well dominate in some 
  regions, especially by the end of the 21st century.</p>
