<h4>5.3.3.1.2. Interactive effects of water availability and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration<br>
</h4>
<p>Although stomatal conductance is decreased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, the 
  ratio of intercellular to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration usually is not 
  modified, and stomata do not appear to limit photosynthesis more in elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> compared to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (Drake <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  Elevated-CO<sub>2</sub> effects on crop evapotranspiration per unit land area 
  (E) have been small with cotton (Dugas <i>et al</i>., 1994; Hunsaker <i>et al</i>., 
  1994; Kimball <i>et al</i>., 1994) and spring wheat (Kimball <i>et al</i>.,1995, 
  1999) crops supplied with ample nitrogen fertilizer. With rice, under field-like 
  conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment reduced seasonal total E by 15% at 26&deg;C 
  but increased E by 20% at 29.5&deg;C (Horie <i>et al</i>., 2000). A larger decline 
  (-22%) in the daily E of a C<sub>4</sub>-dominated tallgrass prairie was reported 
  by Ham <i>et al</i>. (1995), and a strong reduction in water use per plant also 
  was observed for maize (Samarakoon and Gifford, 1996), a C<sub>4</sub> plant. 
  The consequences of these direct effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  on E are still unclear at the catchment scale (see <a href="165.htm">Section 
  4.3.3</a>). </p>
<p>Relative enhancement of growth owing to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment might be 
  greater under drought conditions than in wet soil because photosynthesis would 
  be operating in a more CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive region of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  response curve (Andr&eacute; and Du Cloux, 1993; Samarakoon and Gifford, 1995). 
  In the absence of water deficit, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is believed to 
  be CO<sub>2</sub> saturated at present atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  (Bowes, 1993; see also Kirschbaum <i>et al</i>., 1996). However, as a result 
  of stomatal closure, it can become CO<sub>2</sub>-limited under drought. Some 
  of the literature examples in which C<sub>4</sub> crop species, such as maize, 
  have responded to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may have involved (possibly unrecognized) 
  minor water deficits (Samarakoon and Gifford, 1996). Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced 
  growth enhancement in C4 species (e.g., Poorter, 1993) may be caused primarily 
  by improved water relations and WUE (Samarakoon and Gifford, 1996) and secondarily 
  by direct photosynthetic enhancement and altered source-sink relationships (Ruget 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Meinzer and Zhu, 1998). With rice, at the optimal temperature 
  for growth, a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> increases crop WUE by about 50%. However, 
  this increase in WUE declines sharply as temperature increases beyond the optimum 
  (Horie <i>et al</i>., 2000). Although increased productivity from increased 
  WUE is the major response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in a C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> 
  crop that is exposed frequently to water stress (Idso and Idso, 1994; Ham <i>et 
  al</i>., 1995; Drake <i>et al</i>., 1997), changes in climatic factors (temperature, 
  rainfall) may interact with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> to alter soil water status, 
  which in turn will influence hydrology and nutrient relations. Therefore, to 
  realistically project impacts on crop yields and regional evaporation (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>), more research is needed on the interactions of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  high temperature, and precipitation. </p>
<h4><a name="53313"></a>5.3.3.1.3. Interactive effects of atmospheric chemistry 
  and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration</h4>
<p>An exposure-response model that linearly relates a change in gas exposure over 
  a time period to log-scale change in biomass increment of a plant during the 
  same period suggests that a decline in recent yields of grain crops caused by 
  an increase in surface ozone concentrations may have reached 20% in some parts 
  of Europe (Semenov <i>et al</i>., 1997, 1998, 1999). Recent research has shown that 
  multiple changes in atmospheric chemistry can lead to compensating or synergistic 
  effects on some crops. Heagle <i>et al</i>. (1999) used field studies to examine the 
  impact of higher O<sub>3</sub> levels on cotton growth under higher CO<sub>2</sub> 
  conditions. They found that higher CO<sub>2</sub> compensates for growth suppression 
  resulting from elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels. With wheat, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  fully protects against the detrimental effects of O<sub>3</sub> on biomass but 
  not yield (McKee <i>et al</i>., 1997). Similar results have been reported with soybean 
  (Fiscus <i>et al</i>., 1997) and tomato (Reinert <i>et al</i>., 1997). Meyer <i>et al</i>. (1997) 
  measured responses of spring wheat to different levels of ozone in chambers 
  at different growth stages and found that photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulations 
  were strongly affected during anthesis, especially after a period of heat stress.</p>
<p>Mark and Tevini (1997) observed combined effects of UV-B, temperature, and 
  CO<sub>2</sub> in growth chambers in seedlings of sunflower and maize. They 
  found that a 4&deg;C rise in daily maximum temperature (from 28 to 32&deg;C), 
  with or without higher CO<sub>2</sub>, compensated for losses from enhanced 
  UV-B. Teramura <i>et al</i>. (1990) report that yield increases with elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> are suppressed by UV-B more in cereals than in soybean; rice 
  also loses its CO<sub>2</sub>-enhanced WUE. However, Unsworth and Hogsett (1996) 
  assert that many research studies from the preceding decade used unrealistic 
  UV-B exposures, and they conclude that UV-B does not pose a threat to crops 
  alone or in combination with other stressors. </p>
