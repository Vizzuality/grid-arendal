<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In this summary we indicate our uncertainty in observations, mechanisms, and 
  scenarios by using a five-point scale, from "very high confidence" 
  (*****) to "very low confidence" (*).</p>
<h4>Climate Changes in the 20th Century</h4>
<p> Although there are some regional anomalies, there is strong evidence that 
  climate change has had an impact in the Arctic and the Antarctic. Many documented 
  changes already parallel those forecast to result from climate change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Arctic, extensive land areas show a 20th-century warming trend in 
    air temperature of as much as 5&deg;C. Over sea ice, there has been slight 
    warming in the 1961-1990 period.***** Precipitation has increased.**</li>
  <li>Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased by 2.9% per decade over the 1978-1996 
    period; sea ice has thinned, and there are now more melt days per summer. 
    Sea-ice extent in the Nordic seas has decreased by 30% over the past 130 years.***** 
    It is not yet clear whether changes in sea ice of the past few decades are 
    linked to a natural cycle in climate variability or have resulted explicitly 
    from global warming</li>
  <li>Atlantic water flowing into the Arctic Ocean has warmed, and the surface 
    layer has become thinner. The mixed layer in the Beaufort Sea has become less 
    saline.****</li>
  <li>Regions underlain by permafrost have been reduced in extent, and a general 
    warming of ground temperatures has been observed in many areas.*****</li>
  <li>There has been a statistically significant decrease in spring snow extent 
    over Eurasia since 1915.****</li>
  <li>In summary, many observations of environmental change in the Arctic show 
    a trend that is consistent with warming and similar to that predicted by general 
    circulation models (GCMs).</li>
  <li>In the Antarctic, over the past half-century there has been a marked warming 
    trend in the Antarctic Peninsula.**** Elsewhere there is a general but not 
    unambiguous warming trend.** </li>
  <li>Precipitation in the Antarctic has increased.*</li>
  <li>Satellite observations show no significant change in Antarctic sea-ice extent 
    over the 1973-1996 period.***** Analysis of whaling records and modeling studies 
    indicate that Antarctic sea ice retreated south by 2.8 degrees of latitude 
    between the mid-1950s and the early 1970s.***</li>
  <li>Surface waters of the Southern Ocean have warmed and become less saline.***</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="1"></a>Impacts</h4>
<p>Substantial warming and increases in precipitation are projected for polar 
  regions over the 21st century by almost all climate models. There are eight 
  key concerns related to the impact of this climate change in the Arctic and 
  Antarctic. Associated with these concerns will be changes to the atmosphere 
  and the oceans that will propagate to other regions of the world:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Changes in ice sheets and polar glaciers</i>: Increased melting is expected 
    on Arctic glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet, and they will retreat and 
    thin close to their margins. Most of the Antarctic ice sheet is likely to 
    thicken as a result of increased precipitation. There is a small risk, however, 
    that the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will retreat in coming centuries. 
    Together, these cryospheric changes may make a significant contribution to 
    sea-level rise.**** </li>
  <li><i>Changes around the Antarctic Peninsula</i>: This region has experienced 
    spectacular retreat and collapse of ice shelves, which has been related to 
    a southerly migration of the January 0&deg;C isotherm resulting from regional 
    warming. The loss of these ice shelves has few direct impacts. Projected warming 
    is likely, however, to break up ice shelves further south on the Antarctic 
    Peninsula, expose more bare ground, and cause changes in terrestrial biology, 
    such as introduction of exotic plants and animals.****</li>
  <li><i>Changes in the Southern Ocean and impacts on its life</i>: Climate change 
    is likely to produce long-term&#151;perhaps irreversible&#151;changes in the 
    physical oceanography and ecology of the Southern Ocean. Projected reductions 
    in sea-ice extent will alter under-ice biota and spring bloom in the sea-ice 
    marginal zone and will cause profound impacts at all levels in the food chain, 
    from algae to krill to the great whales. Marine mammals and birds, which have 
    life histories that tie them to specific breeding sites, will be severely 
    affected by shifts in their foraging habitats and migration of prey species. 
    Warmer water will potentially intensify biological activity and growth rates 
    of fish. Ultimately, this should lead to an increase in the catch of marketable 
    fish, and retreat of sea ice will provide easier access to southern fisheries.***</li>
  <li><i>Changes in sea ice</i>: There will be substantial loss of sea ice in 
    the Arctic Ocean. Predictions for summer ice indicate that its extent could 
    shrink by 60% for a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), opening new 
    sea routes. This will have major trading and strategic implications. With 
    more open water, there will be a moderation of temperatures and an increase 
    in precipitation in Arctic lands. Antarctic sea-ice volume is predicted to 
    decrease by 25% or more for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, with sea ice retreating 
    about 2 degrees of latitude.****</li>
  <li><i>Changes in permafrost</i>: Thickening of the seasonally thawed layer 
    above permafrost (active layer) is expected. Modeling studies indicate that 
    large areas of permafrost terrain will begin to thaw, leading to changes in 
    drainage, increased mass movements, thermal erosion, and altered landscapes 
    in much of the Arctic and subarctic. Warming of permafrost, thawing of ground 
    ice, and development of thermokarst terrain have been documented over the 
    past several decades. In developed areas of the Arctic, continuation of such 
    changes may lead to costly damage to human infrastructure.****</li>
  <li><i>Changes in Arctic hydrology</i>: The hydrology of the Arctic is particularly 
    susceptible to warming because small rises in temperature will result in increased 
    melting of snow and ice, with consequent impacts on the water cycle. There 
    will be a shift to a runoff regime that is driven increasingly by rainfall, 
    with less seasonal variation in runoff. There will be more ponding of water 
    in some areas, but peatlands may dry out because of increased evaporation 
    and transpiration from plants. In some areas, thawing of permafrost will improve 
    infiltration. An expected reduction in ice-jam flooding will have serious 
    impacts on riverbank ecosystems and aquatic ecology, particularly in the highly 
    productive Arctic river deltas. Changes in Arctic runoff will affect sea-ice 
    production, deepwater formation in the North Atlantic, and regional climate. 
    A major impact would result from a weakening of the global thermohaline circulation 
    as a result of a net increase in river flow and the resulting increased flux 
    of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean.***</li>
  <li><i>Changes in Arctic biota</i>: Warming should increase biological production; 
    however, the effects of increased precipitation on biological production are 
    unclear. As warming occurs, there will be changes in species compositions 
    on land and in the sea, with a tendency for poleward shifts in species assemblages 
    and loss of some polar species. Changes in sea ice will alter the seasonal 
    distributions, geographic ranges, patterns of migration, nutritional status, 
    reproductive success, and ultimately the abundance and balance of species. 
    Animals that are dependent on sea ice&#151;such as seals, walrus, and polar 
    bears&#151;will be disadvantaged. High-arctic plants will show a strong growth 
    response to summer warming. It is unlikely that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels 
    will increase carbon accumulation in plants, but they may be damaged by higher 
    ultraviolet-B radiation. Biological production in lakes and ponds will increase.***</li>
  <li><i>Impacts on human communities</i>: Climate change, in combination with 
    other stresses, will affect human communities in the Arctic. The impacts may 
    be particularly disruptive for communities of indigenous peoples following 
    traditional lifestyles. Changes in sea ice, seasonality of snow, and habitat 
    and diversity of food species will affect hunting and gathering practices 
    and could threaten longstanding traditions and ways of life. On the other 
    hand, communities that practice these lifestyles may be sufficiently resilient 
    to cope with these changes. Increased economic costs are expected to affect 
    infrastructure, in response to thawing of permafrost and reduced transportation 
    capabilities across frozen ground and water. However, there will be economic 
    benefits&#151;including new opportunities for trade and shipping across the 
    Arctic Ocean, lower operational costs for the oil and gas industry, lower 
    heating costs, and easier access for ship-based tourism.*****</li>
