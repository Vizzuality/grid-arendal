<h3>4.3.3. Evaporation</h3>
<p>Evaporation from the land surface includes evaporation from open water, soil, 
  shallow groundwater, and water stored on vegetation, along with transpiration 
  through plants. The rate of evaporation from the land surface is driven essentially 
  by meteorological controls, mediated by the characteristics of vegetation and 
  soils, and constrained by the amount of water available. Climate change has 
  the potential to affect all of these factors&#151;in a combined way that is 
  not yet clearly understood&#151; with different components of evaporation affected 
  differently.</p>
<p>The primary meteorological controls on evaporation from a well-watered surface 
  (often known as potential evaporation) are the amount of energy available (characterized 
  by net radiation), the moisture content of the air (humidity&#151;a function 
  of water vapor content and air temperature), and the rate of movement of air 
  across the surface (a function of windspeed). Increasing temperature generally 
  results in an increase in potential evaporation, largely because the water-holding 
  capacity of air is increased. Changes in other meteorological controls may exaggerate 
  or offset the rise in temperature, and it is possible that increased water vapor 
  content and lower net radiation could lead to lower evaporative demands. The 
  relative importance of different meteorological controls, however, varies geographically. 
  In dry regions, for example, potential evaporation is driven by energy and is 
  not constrained by atmospheric moisture contents, so changes in humidity are 
  relatively unimportant. In humid regions, however, atmospheric moisture content 
  is a major limitation to evaporation, so changes in humidity have a very large 
  effect on the rate of evaporation.</p>
<p>Several studies have assessed the effect of changes in meteorological controls 
  on evaporation (e.g., Chattopadhyary and Hulme, 1997), using models of the evaporation 
  process, and the effect of climate change has been shown to depend on baseline 
  climate (and the relative importance of the different controls) and the amount 
  of change. Chattopadhyary and Hulme (1997) calculated increases in potential 
  evaporation across India from GCM simulations of climate; they found that projected 
  increases in potential evaporation were related largely to increases in the 
  vapor pressure deficit resulting from higher temperature. It is important to 
  emphasize, however, that different evaporation calculation equations give different 
  estimates of absolute evaporation rates and sensitivity to change. Therefore, 
  it can be very difficult to compare results from different studies. Equations 
  that do not consider explicitly all meteorological controls may give very misleading 
  estimates of change.</p>
<p>Vegetation cover, type, and properties play a very important role in evaporation. 
  Interception of precipitation is very much influenced by vegetation type (as 
  indexed by the canopy storage capacity), and different vegetation types have 
  different rates of transpiration. Moreover, different vegetation types produce 
  different amounts of turblence above the canopy; the greater the turbulence, 
  the greater the evaporation. A change in catchment vegetation&#151;directly 
  or indirectly as a result of climate change&#151;therefore may affect the catchment 
  water balance (there is a huge hydrological literature on the effects of changing 
  catchment vegetation). Several studies have assessed changes in biome type under 
  climate change (e.g., Friend et al., 1997), but the hydrological effects of 
  such changes&#151;and, indeed, changes in agricultural land use&#151;have not 
  yet been explored.</p>
<p>Although transpiration from plants through their stomata is driven by energy, 
  atmospheric moisture, and turbulence, plants exert a degree of control over 
  transpiration, particularly when water is limiting. Stomatal conductance in 
  many plants falls as the vapor pressure deficit close to the leaf increases, 
  temperature rises, or less water becomes available to the roots&#151;and transpiration 
  therefore falls. Superimposed on this short-term variation in stomatal conductance 
  is the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations. 
  Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations reduce stomatal conductance in C<sub>3</sub> 
  plants (which include virtually all woody plants and temperate grasses and crops), 
  although experimental studies show that the effects vary considerably between 
  species and depend on nutrient and water status. Plant water-use efficiency 
  (WUE, or water use per unit of biomass) therefore may increase substantially 
  (Morison, 1987), implying a reduction in transpiration. However, higher CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations also may be associated with increased plant growth, compensating 
  for increased WUE, and plants also may acclimatize to higher CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations. There have been considerably fewer studies into total plant 
  water use than into stomatal conductance, and most empirical evidence to date 
  is at the plant scale; it is difficult to generalize to the catchment or regional 
  scale (Field et al., 1995; Gifford et al., 1996; Amthor, 1999). Free-air CO<sub>2</sub> 
  enrichment (FACE) experiments, however, have allowed extrapolation at least 
  to the 20-m plot scale. Experiments with cotton, for example (Hunsaker et al., 
  1994), showed no detectable change in water use per unit land area when CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations were increased to 550 ppmv; the 40% increase in biomass offset 
  increased WUE. Experiments with wheat, however, indicated that increased growth 
  did not offset increased WUE, and evaporation declined by approximately 7% (although 
  still less than implied by the change in stomatal conductance; Kimball et al., 
  1999). Some model studies (e.g., Field et al., 1995, for forest; Bunce et al., 
  1997, for alfalfa and grass; Cao and Woodward, 1998, at the global scale) suggest 
  that the net direct effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at the 
  catchment scale will be small (Korner, 1996), but others (e.g., Pollard and 
  Thompson, 1995; Dickinson et al., 1997; Sellers et al., 1997; Raupach, 1998, 
  as discussed by Kimball et al., 1999) indicate that stomata have more control 
  on regional evaporation. There clearly is a large degree of uncertainty over 
  the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment on catchment-scale evaporation, but 
  it is apparent that reductions in stomatal conductance do not necessarily translate 
  into reductions in catchment-scale evaporation.</p>
<p>The actual rate of evaporation is constrained by water availability. A reduction 
  in summer soil water, for example, could lead to a reduction in the rate of 
  evaporation from a catchment despite an increase in evaporative demands. Arnell 
  (1996) estimated for a sample of UK catchments that the rate of actual evaporation 
  would increase by a smaller percentage than the atmospheric demand for evaporation, 
  with the greatest difference in the &#147;driest&#148; catchments, where water 
  limitations are greatest.</p>
