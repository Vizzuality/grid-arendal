<h4>10.2.3.2. Indigenous Biodiversity and Protected Areas</h4>
<p>Africa occupies about one-fifth of the global land surface and contains about 
  one-fifth of all known species of plants, mammals, and birds in the world, as 
  well as one-sixth of amphibians and reptiles (Siegfried, 1989). This biodiversity 
  is concentrated in several centers of endemism. The Cape Floral Kingdom (fynbos), 
  which occupies only 37,000 km<sup>2</sup> at the southern tip of Africa, has 7,300 plant 
  species&#151;of which 68% occur nowhere else in the world (Gibbs, 1987). The 
  adjacent Succulent Karoo biome contains an additional 4,000 species, of which 
  2,500 are endemic (Cowling <i>et al.</i>, 1998). These floristic biodiversity 
  hotspots both occur in winter rainfall regions at the southern tip of the continent 
  and are threatened particularly by a shift in rainfall seasonality (for instance, 
  a reduction in winter rainfall amounts or an increase in summer rainfall, which 
  would alter the fire regime that is critical to regeneration in the fynbos). 
  Other major centers of plant endemism are Madagascar, the mountains of Cameroon, 
  and the island-like Afromontane habitats that stretch from Ethiopia to South 
  Africa at altitudes above about 2,000 m (Mace <i>et al.,</i> 1998). Montane 
  centers of biodiversity are particularly threatened by increases in temperature 
  because many represent isolated populations with no possibility of vertical 
  or horizontal migration. Several thousand species of plants alone are potentially 
  affected.</p>
<p>The broad patterns of African zoogeography also are climatically linked, but 
  the location of concentrations of biodiversity and endemism, at least in the 
  higher animals, is located in the savannas and tropical forests. World antelope 
  and gazelle biodiversity (more than 90% of the global total of 80 species) is 
  concentrated in Africa (Macdonald, 1987). Changes in climate of the magnitude 
  predicted for the 21st century could alter the distribution range of antelope 
  species (Hulme, 1996). </p>
<p>This biodiversity forms an important resource for African people. Uses are 
  consumptive (food, fiber, fuel, shelter, medicinal, wildlife trade) and nonconsumptive 
  (ecosystem services and the economically important tourism industry).</p>
<p>For a sample of 39 African countries, a median 4% of the continental land surface 
  is in formally declared conservation areas in southern Africa (MacKinnon and 
  MacKinnon, 1986). The fraction of landscape that is conserved varies greatly 
  between countries (from 17% in Botswana to 0% in four countries), as does the 
  degree of actual protection offered within nominally conserved areas (MacKinnon 
  and MacKinnon, 1986). A very large fraction of African biodiversity occurs principally 
  outside of formally conserved areas (especially in central and northern Africa), 
  as a result of a relatively low rate of intensive agricultural transformation 
  on the continent. This will no longer be true if massive extensification of 
  agriculture and clearing of tropical forests occurs in the humid and subhumid 
  zones, as is predicted to occur in the next century by some land-cover change 
  models (Alcamo, 1994). Patterns of human pressure, including grazing by domestic 
  stock, also will be altered and intensified by climate change. Land-use conversion 
  effects on biodiversity in affected areas will overshadow climate change effects 
  for some time to come.</p>
<p>In the medium term (~10-20 years), biodiversity of indigenous plants and 
  animals in Africa is likely to be affected by all of the major environmental 
  changes that constitute climate change. These include changes in ambient air 
  temperature, rainfall and air vapor pressure deficit (which combine to cause 
  altered water balance), rainfall variability, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
</p>
<p>Africa&#151;like the other continents, though perhaps to a greater degree&#151;is 
  characterized by ecosystem control through disturbance, such as fire (Bond and 
  van Wilgen, 1996) and grazing regimes. Changing disturbance regimes will interact 
  with climate change in important ways to control biodiversity&#151;for instance 
  through rapid, discontinous ecosystem "switches." For example, changes 
  in the grazing and fire regime during the past century are thought to have increased 
  woody-plant density over large parts of southern Africa. Ecosystem switches 
  are accompanied by drastic species shifts and even species extinction. Subtle 
  changes in species composition of rich ecosystems such as forests will impact 
  biodiversity resources. A significant reduction in rainfall or increase in evapotranspiration 
  in Angola would threaten the Okavango delta wetland in Botswana. Much larger 
  scale ecosystem switches (e.g., savanna to grassland, forest to savanna, shrubland 
  to grassland) clearly occurred in the past (e.g., during the climatic amelioration 
  dating from the last glacial maximum), but diversity losses were ameliorated 
  by species and ecosystem geographical shifts. The geographical range shifts 
  recquired to preserve biodiversity into the future will be strongly constrained 
  by habitat fragmentation and cannot realistically be accommodated by a static 
  nature reserve network with the low areal coverage evident in Africa. </p>
<p>Theory required to predict the extent and nature of future ecosystem switches 
  and species geographical shifts in Africa is lacking, and case studies are few. 
  The response of major vegetation types to changes such as rising atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> are almost unstudied, although early evidence (Midgley <i>et al., </i>1999; 
  Wand <i>et al.,</i> 1999) suggests, for example, that these responses may increase 
  WUE in grass species significantly, which may increase grass fuel load or even 
  increase water supply to deeper rooted trees. Recent analysis of tree/grass 
  interactions in savannas suggests that rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> may increase tree 
  densities (Midgley<i> et al.,</i> 1999); this kind of ecosystem switch would 
  have major implications for grazing and browsing animal guilds and their predators. 
  For southern Africa, between one-quarter and one-third of current reserves were 
  predicted to experience a biome shift (a major change in the dominant plant 
  functional types) under the equilibrium climate resulting from a twice-preindustrial 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Hulme, 1996). In South Africa, increased aridity in the interior 
  Bushmanland plateau will introduce a desert-like environment to the country 
  (Rutherford <i>et al., </i>1999). Analysis for South African conservation areas 
  (Rutherford <i>et al.,</i> 1999) shows potentially large losses of plant species 
  diversity in this semi-arid region with low landscape heterogeneity. </p>
<p>Thus, the vegetation and animal communities that many reserves aim to conserve 
  will no longer be within their preferred bioclimatic region. Migration of animals 
  to conserved areas with more suitable climate (if these exist) will be constrained 
  by fragmentation of intervening ecosystems and potentially hostile landscapes. 
  The required rate of migration may be too rapid for unassisted movement of most 
  plant species, especially over relatively flat landscapes (Rutherford <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1995). Without adaptive and mitigating strategies, the impact of climate 
  change will be to reduce the effectiveness of the reserve network significantly, 
  by altering ecosystem characteristics within it and causing species emigrations 
  or extinctions. </p>
<p>At particular risk of major biodiversity loss are reserves on flat and extensive 
  landscapes, those in areas where rainfall regime may change seasonality (e.g., 
  the southern Cape), those where the tree/grass balance is sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, 
  and those where the fire regime may be altered. Species most at risk are those 
  with limited distribution ranges and/or poor dispersal abilities, habitat specialists 
  (soil specialists in the case of plants), and those that are responsive to specific 
  disturbance regimes.</p>
<p>Mitigation and adaptation strategies will be greatly strengthened by a risk-sharing 
  approach between countries, which could attempt to share the burden of conserving 
  critical populations in a collaborative way. Part of this risk-sharing approach 
  could include transboundary nature reserves, where this is appropriate for increasing 
  connectivity in areas projected to change significantly. The corridor approach 
  within and between countries would have the added benefit of increasing reserve 
  resilience to current climate variability and would increase attractiveness 
  to the tourism industry. Economic incentives, however, may differ across geographic 
  scales. For the moist tropical forests of Masoala National Park in northeast 
  Madagascar, economic incentives favor conservation at local and global scales, 
  although logging provides more profit at a national scale (Kremen<i> et al.,</i> 
  2000).</p>
<p>A high degree of uncertainty is associated with predictions of the biodiversity 
  effects of climate change. No systematic analysis of mechanisms of ecosystem 
  switches, or areas exposed to them, has been carried out. Although fire and 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> seem to be important determinants of ecosystem structure and 
  function, little research is available to predict how these factors will interact 
  with other environmental changes. The effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on grass water use may 
  be an important mitigator of negative effects on productivity for grazer guilds 
  in much of subtropical Africa. Effects of shifts of disease-prone areas on animal 
  populations are unstudied.</p>
