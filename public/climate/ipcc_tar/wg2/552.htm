<h4><a name="15122"></a>15.1.2.2. Urbanization</h4>
<p>Within developed regions of North America, one important feature is the high-value 
  concentrated development center or corridor. Proliferation of these centers 
  and corridors (e.g., U.S. Gulf coast, Boston-New York-Washington corridor) can 
  lead to high damage costs from extreme events associated with weather phenomena 
  (see Sections <a href="574.htm">15.2.5</a> and <a href="579.htm">15.2.7</a>).</p>
<p>A second feature concerns extension of urban land use into previously undeveloped 
  or less-developed areas, including agricultural lands, forested areas, wetlands, 
  barrier islands, and other coastal margins. In the case of urban encroachment 
  on forested areas, climate change effects on human use and value of forest ecosystems 
  are likely to be significant but are very poorly understood (Binkley and Van 
  Kooten, 1994). This is a challenge in considering traditional human uses of 
  forests for wood products, recreational space, or environmental protection. 
  A more recent phenomenon that must be considered, however, is the increase in 
  human populations in many forested areas in the mid-latitude regions of North 
  America. For example, in the Colorado Rocky Mountains in the United States, 
  human population is expected to double in the next 20-40 years (Stohlgren, 
  1999). These population increases will amplify climate-induced stresses on forest 
  habitat and species assemblages. Moreover, these increases will increase the 
  exposure of human populations to climate-induced catastrophic events (e.g., 
  fire, floods).<br>

<h4> <a name="15123"></a>15.1.2.3. Continental Free Trade</h4>
<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, the United 
  States, and Mexico has contributed to several changes in economic activity. 
  One indicator is the recent increase in the population of Mexican states along 
  the U.S.-Mexican border (see <a href="#tab152">Table 15-2</a>), which is at 
  a faster rate than for Mexico as a whole. Such shifts may alter the relationship 
  between regions and their climate, affecting the nature of future climate-related 
  impacts and adaptation responses (e.g., see <a href="589.htm">Section 15.3.2.9</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="1513"></a>15.1.3. Past to Present</h3>
<p>Society has long viewed climate as "constant"&#151;that is, we expect 
  year-to-year variations, but we expect that the chances of hurricanes, floods, 
  or heat waves don't change with time. The probability of a 100-year event 
  (defined by crossing some threshold&#151;say, 5 cm of rain in an hour) should 
  be a constant. As we have developed longer records of climate&#151;from geologic 
  records in ice cores and sediments to longer and longer instrumental records&#151;we 
  have learned that this assumption of constancy simply is not true. As we look 
  back and see constant change, we should look to the future and expect additional 
  changes to climate and to climate variability.<br>
</p>
<p>There have been significant changes (i.e., trends) in North America's 
  climate over the past century. As a whole, North America has warmed by about 
  0.7&deg;C (Carter <i>et al</i>., 2000), although this warming has been quite heterogeneous. 
  For example, the southeastern United States cooled slightly over that same period, 
  although recent decades have seen some warming. There also have been trends 
  in precipitation. Annual precipitation over North America decreased by about 
  50 mm in the early years of the century and since then has steadily increased 
  by ~70 mm. These trends, like those of temperature, have been fairly heterogeneous. 
  The largest increases have been in the northern Atlantic and Pacific coastal 
  regions. Some regions have experienced seasonal decreases in precipitation. 
  Accompanying these trends in temperature and precipitation, which are fairly 
  well measured, have been changes in cloud cover and humidity, which affect plant 
  growth as well as people's perception of temperature. Inferences from atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and satellite data suggest that the northern growing season (the period 
  of active plant growth) has lengthened appreciably over the past decades (Myneni 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997), and data from Alaska show an unequivocal warming trend in the 
  western Arctic (Bering Sea Impacts Study, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Over the course of the 20th century, there have been several extreme periods 
  in the climate. The drought of the 1930s changed all of North American society. 
  The damage to midcontinental agriculture and communities has consequences even 
  today, through changes in land ownership, government policies, and farmer and 
  merchant perceptions of risk. More recently, there have been major consequences 
  of drought, flooding, tropical storms, and tornadoes. There is no clear evidence 
  of trends in the meteorological risks from "heaviest rainfall category" 
  events or that their frequency has changed over the period of instrumental measurements. 
  However, evidence from the paleorecord documents changes over the past thousands 
  of years that lie outside what our contemporary society can remember. For example, 
  there have been several droughts in California, documented in tree-ring and 
  lake-level data, of more than 80 years' duration (Meko <i>et al</i>., 1991). 
  Evidence from the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions suggests that there 
  have been long periods in the Holocene (the time since the last glaciation) 
  when these regions were much drier than today (Woodhouse and Overpeck, 1998). 
  These historical events did not happen as a result of anthropogenic impacts 
  but are within the range of natural climate variability; they provide a caution 
  against assuming that tomorrow's climates will necessarily be no less benign 
  than today's.</p>
