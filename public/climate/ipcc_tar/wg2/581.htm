<h4><a name="15272"></a>15.2.7.2 Government-Based Insurance and Disaster-Relief Systems</h4>
<p>Government entities are vulnerable to climate change as providers of insurance 
  and/or disaster relief; providers of domestic and international disaster preparedness/services; 
  and managers of property and weather-sensitive activities.<br>
</p>
<p>Private insurers find certain weather-related risks to be technically uninsurable 
  as a result of their spatial concentration, actuarial uncertainty, and associated 
  difficulties in pricing. In the United States, this problem arises mostly with 
  respect to crop and flood risks, although government flood insurance is limited 
  to residential and very small commercial customers. There is ongoing tension 
  between government and private-sector players in the natural disaster arena, 
  with each looking to the other to clarify the somewhat ambiguous division of 
  responsibility.<br>
</p>
<p>In Canada, government (federal, provincial, and municipal) has paid most of 
  the natural disaster payments, amounting to US$15 billion (CDN$22 billion) in 
  disaster relief between 1982 and 1999, including 86% of flood-related losses 
  (Emergency Preparedness Canada, 2000). Consolidated data for U.S. government 
  payments for natural disasters are not readily available. One source reports 
  US$119 billion (1993US$) in government outlays between 1977 and 1993 (Anderson, 
  2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Government insurance programs can have difficulty achieving solvency, as exemplified 
  by the US$810 million deficit in the U.S. flood insurance program in the mid-1990s 
  (Anderson, 2000). U.S. crop and flood insurance programs have never been profitable, 
  and growing coastal erosion risks will require doubling of rates in the United 
  States (GAO, 2000; Heinz Center, 2000). Government insurance programs also have 
  resulted in cases of maladaptation (e.g., inducing people to settle in vulnerable 
  areas) (Heinz Center, 2000).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="15273"></a>15.2.7.3 Creating and Maintaining Adaptive Capacity </h4>
<p>Private and public insurers alike have at their disposal a variety of tools 
  to increase adaptive capacity. These tools can be divided into the broad categories 
  of risk spreading and risk reduction (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). 
  Some of these strategies involve shifting of risk between the public and private 
  spheres, or even back to the consumer, and in that regard have considerable 
  public policy ramifications that are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<p>Given their sensitivity and potential vulnerability to weather-related losses, 
  North American insurers and their regulators have designed a variety of adaptation 
  mechanisms. These strategies include economic measures&#151;raising premiums 
  or deductibles, withdrawing coverage, creating systems for pooling risks among 
  multiple insurers (e.g., U.S. government-mandated FAIR Plans or beach/windstorm 
  plans and state-mandated "guaranty funds" based on mandatory contributions of 
  insurers, to pay the claims of insolvent insurers)&#151;and the use of capital 
  mark<i>et al</i>ternatives to finance risk (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). 
  Responses also include more engineering-oriented risk-reduction strategies, 
  such as land-use planning, flood control, cloud seeding (see <a href="584.htm#15324">Section 
  15.3.2.4</a>), and early warning systems.</p>
<p>Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the 1998 ice storm (see <a href="585.htm#15326">Section 
  15.3.2.6</a>) were wake-up calls for the North American insurance industry. 
  Among the numerous responses have been increased utilization of catastrophe 
  modeling, a more proactive stance toward disaster preparedness/recovery, new 
  efforts in land-use planning, increased attention to building codes, and increased 
  use of incentives to implement loss-prevention measures (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 
  1999b). <br>
</p>
<p> One embedded vulnerability facing insurers and government risk managers alike 
  is that, by design, their actuarial outlook and disaster reserving conventions 
  are based on past experience. There is an emerging and encouraging trend to 
  forward-looking catastrophe modeling, although it has yet to integrate knowledge 
  from climate change modeling. Thus, under climate change, the potential for 
  surprise is real. Vulnerability is compounded by the potential for changes in 
  the frequency, variability, and/or spatial distribution of extreme weather events. 
  Increased uncertainties of this nature can complicate and confound insurer methods 
  for preparing for future events (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1998).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="15274"></a>15.2.7.4 Equity and Sustainability Issues in Relation 
  to Insurance </h4>
<p>Although North America is a wealthy region, significant equity considerations 
  arise from its cultural and economic diversity (Hooke, 2000). This raises important 
  issues concerning the design and deployment of effective natural disaster preparedness 
  programs (Solis <i>et al</i>., 1997). Lower income groups tend to live in more 
  vulnerable housing and are least able to afford potential increases in insurance 
  costs by insurers or cross-subsidies utilized to spread risks (Miller <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000). Poorer individuals also tend to carry little if any life and 
  health insurance and thus may be uninsured against public health risks such 
  as urban heat catastrophes or urban air quality risks posed by climate change 
  (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>).<br>
</p>
<p> In some cases, sustainable development and environmental protection complement 
  insurance loss reduction objectives. Examples include protection or restoration 
  of wetland areas that increases tidal flooding defense, sustainable forest practices 
  that reduce risk of inland flooding and mudslides, or agricultural practices 
  that increase drought resistance or reduce soil erosion (see <a href="196.htm">Chapters 
  5</a> and <a href="321.htm">8</a>; Scott and Coustalin, 1995; Hamilton, 2000). 
  Similarly on the end-user side, a variety of energy conservation and renewable 
  energy measures have been found to offer insurance loss-control co-benefits 
  (Mills, 1996, 1999; Nutter, 1996; Mills and Knoepfel, 1997; American Insurance 
  Association, 1999; Vine <i>et al</i>., 1999). The insurance sector itself has 
  begun to examine its activities within the broader framework of sustainability 
  (Mileti, 1997; Kunreuther and Roth, 1998).</p>
