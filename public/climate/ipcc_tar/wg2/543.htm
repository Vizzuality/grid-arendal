<h2>14.3. Synthesis</h2>
<p>There is ample evidence of climate variability at a wide range of time scales 
  all over Latin America, from intraseasonal to long term. For instance, at decadal 
  scales, multiple climate records throughout the region consistently exhibit 
  a shift in the mean during the mid-1970s, which could be a consequence of sudden 
  changes in the climatology of the Pacific Ocean. These changes have important 
  socioeconomic and environmental consequences that could be enhanced by global 
  warming and its associated climate change. </p>
<p>Precipitation changes in Latin America do not follow a consistent trend. In 
  northwestern Mexico there is a clear tendency for more winter precipitation, 
  which has resulted in positive trends in river-water level. In north and northwestern 
  Nicaragua, there is a negative trend in rainfall. In the Amazonian region, the 
  most important finding is the presence of periods with relatively wetter or 
  drier conditions that are more relevant than any unidirectional trend. Rainfall 
  in north-northeast Brazil exhibits a weak positive trend. Precipitation in subtropical 
  Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil increased abruptly in the 1956-1990 period 
  after a dry period from 1921 to 1995. In the Pampas, there was a positive trend 
  in precipitation over the 1890-1984 period. At higher elevations in northwestern 
  Argentina, records suggest an increase in precipitation over the past 200 years.</p>
<p>The Southern Oscillation is responsible for a large part of the climate variability 
  at interannual scales in Latin America. The region is vulnerable to El Ni&ntilde;o, 
  with impacts varying across the continent. For example, El Ni&ntilde;o is associated 
  with dry conditions in northeast Brazil, northern Amazonia, the Peruvian-Bolivian 
  Altiplano, and the Pacific coast of Central America, whereas southern Brazil 
  and northwestern Peru exhibit anomalously wet conditions. Extensive studies 
  of the Caribbean watersheds of Mexico and other countries show compelling evidence 
  of more winter and less summer precipitation; in addition, the most severe droughts 
  in Mexico in recent decades have occurred during El Ni&ntilde;o years. In Colombia, 
  La Ni&ntilde;a is associated with heavy precipitation and flooding, whereas 
  El Ni&ntilde;o is associated with negative anomalies in precipitation and river 
  streamflow. Drought also occurs in southern Brazil during the positive phase 
  of the Southern Oscillation. If El Ni&ntilde;o or La Ni&ntilde;a were to increase, 
  Latin America would be exposed to these conditions more often (see <a href="#tab146">Table 
  14-6</a>).</p>

<p>Warming in high mountain regions could lead to disappearance of significant 
  snow and ice surfaces, which could affect mountain sport and tourist activities. 
  Because these areas contribute to river streamflow, it also would affect water 
  availability for irrigation, hydropower generation, and navigation, which represent 
  important sources of income for some economies. It has been well-established 
  that glaciers in Latin America have receded in recent decades. </p>
<p>It is well-established that Latin America accounts for one of the Earth's 
  largest concentrations of biodiversity, and the impacts of climate change can 
  be expected to increase the risk of biodiversity loss. Some adverse impacts 
  on species that can be related to regional climate change have been observed, 
  such as population declines in frogs and small mammals in Central America. Maintenance 
  of remaining Amazonian forest is threatened by the combination of human disturbance 
  and decreased precipitation from evapotranspiration loss, global warming, and 
  El Ni&ntilde;o. Fire in standing forest has increased in frequency and scale 
  in Amazonia as a result of greater accumulation of deadwood in the forest from 
  logging activity and from trees killed by past fires, more human settlement 
  providing opportunities for fire initiation, and dry conditions during ENSO 
  events. Neotropical seasonally dry forest should be considered severely threatened 
  in Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>Mortality of trees has been observed to increase under dry conditions that 
  prevail near newly formed edges in Amazonian forests. Edges, which affect an 
  increasingly large portion of the forest with the advance of deforestation, 
  would be especially susceptible to the effects of reduced rainfall. In Mexico, 
  deciduous tropical forest would be affected in approximately 50% of the area 
  presently covered by these forests. Heavy rain during the 1997-1998 ENSO 
  event generated drastic changes in the dry ecosystems of northern Peru's 
  coastal zone. Increases in biomass burning in Amazonia affected by human activity 
  and by climate increase wind-borne smoke and dust that supply nutrients to the 
  Amazon forests. Global warming would expand the area that is suitable for tropical 
  forests as equilibrium vegetation types. However, the forces driving deforestation 
  make it unlikely that tropical forests will be permitted to occupy these increased 
  areas. Land-use change interacts with climate through positive feedback processes 
  that accelerate loss of humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>Sea-level rise will eliminate the present habitats of mangroves and create 
  new tidally inundated areas to which some mangrove species may shift. Coastal 
  inundation stemming from sea-level rise and riverine and flatland flooding would 
  affect water availability and agricultural land. These changes can exacerbate 
  socioeconomic and health problems in critical areas. </p>
<p>On a scale of decades to centuries, it is well-established that changes in 
  precipitation and catchment runoff may have significant effects on mangrove 
  forest communities. This also would affect the region's fisheries because 
  most commercial shellfish and finfish use mangroves as nurseries and for refuge. 
</p>
<p>Studies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay, based on GCMs and 
  crop models, project decreased yield for several crops (e.g., maize, wheat, 
  barley, grapes), even when the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization and implementation 
  of moderate adaptation measures at the farm level are considered. Predicted 
  increases in temperature will reduce crops yields in the region by shortening 
  the crop cycle. Although relationships between the amount of precipitation and 
  crop yields are well-established, the lack of consistency in the results of 
  different GCMs means that confidence in the estimated impacts of future precipitation 
  on crop production is necessarily limited.</p>
<p>Over the past 40 years, the contribution of agriculture to the GDP of Latin 
  American countries has been on the order of 10%. Agriculture remains a key sector 
  in the regional economy because it employs 30-40% of the economically active 
  population. It also is very important for the food security of the poorest sectors 
  of the population. Subsistence farming could be severely threatened in some 
  parts of Latin America (e.g., northeastern Brazil).</p>
<p>Evidence is established but incomplete that climate change would reduce silvicultural 
  yields because water often limits growth during the dry season, which is expected 
  to become longer and more intense in many parts of Latin America. </p>
<p>The scale of health impacts from climate change in Latin America would depend 
  primarily on the size, density, location, and wealth of populations. Evidence 
  has been established but incomplete that exposure to heat or cold waves has 
  impacts on mortality rates in risk groups in the region. </p>
<p>Increases in temperature would affect human health in polluted cities such 
  as Mexico City and Santiago. Ample evidence provides high confidence that the 
  geographical distribution of VBDs in Peru and Cuba (e.g., cholera, meningitis) 
  would change if temperature and precipitation were to increase, although there 
  is speculation about what the changes in patterns of diseases would be in different 
  places. It is well-established that weather disasters (extreme events) tend 
  to increase death and morbidity rates (injuries, infectious diseases, social 
  problems, and damage to sanitary infrastructure)&#151;as occurred in Central 
  America with Hurricane Mitch at the end of 1998, heavy rains in Mexico and Venezuela 
  at the end of 1999, and in Argentina in 2000. It is well-established that the 
  ENSO phenomenon causes changes in disease-vector populations and in the incidence 
  of water-borne diseases in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Venezuela. 
  It has been speculated that weather factors and climate change may affect the 
  incidence of diseases such as allergies in Mexico. Increased temperature, ultraviolet 
  radiation, sea-level rise, and changes in pest ecology may threaten food production 
  in Argentina. </p>
<p>In summary, climate change already has a diverse array of impacts in Latin 
  America. Projected future changes in climate, together with future changes in 
  the vulnerability of human and natural systems, could lead to impacts that are 
  much larger than those experienced to date.</p>
