<h3><a name="722"></a>7.2.2. Aggregate Impacts</h3>
<p>With a small temperature increase, aggregate market-sector impacts could amount 
  to plus or minus a few percent of world GDP (medium confidence); aggregate nonmarket 
  impacts could be negative (low confidence). The small net impacts are mainly 
  the result of the fact that developed economies, many of which could have positive 
  impacts, contribute the majority of global production. Applying more weight 
  to impacts in poorer countries to reflect equity concerns, however, can result 
  in net aggregate impacts that are negative even at medium warming. It also is 
  possible that a majority of people will be negatively affected by climate change 
  scenarios in this range, even if the net aggregate monetary impact is positive. 
  With medium to higher temperature increases, benefits tend to decrease and damages 
  increase, so the net change in global economic welfare becomes negative&#151;and 
  increasingly negative with greater warming (medium confidence). Some sectors, 
  such as coastal and water resources, could have negative impacts in developed 
  and developing countries. Other sectors, such as agriculture and human health, 
  could have net positive impacts in some countries and net negative impacts in 
  other countries. [<a href="676.htm">19.5</a>]</p>
<p>Results are sensitive to assumptions about changes in regional climate, levels 
  of development, adaptive capacity, rates of change, valuation of impacts, and 
  methods used for aggregating losses and gains, including the choice of discount 
  rate. In addition, these studies do not consider potentially important factors 
  such as changes in extreme events, advantageous and complementary responses 
  to the threat of non-climate-driven extreme events, rapid change in regional 
  climate (e.g., resulting from changes in ocean circulation), compounding effects 
  of multiple stresses, or conflicting or complementary reaction to those stresses. 
  Because these factors have yet to be accounted for in estimates of aggregate 
  impacts and estimates do not include all possible categories of impacts, particularly 
  nonmarket impacts, estimates of aggregate economic welfare impacts of climate 
  change are considered to be incomplete. Given the uncertainties about aggregate 
  estimates, the possibility of negative effects at a small increase in temperature 
  cannot be excluded. [<a href="676.htm">19.5</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="723"></a>7.2.3. Distribution of Impacts</h3>
<p>Developing countries tend to be more vulnerable to climate change than developed 
  countries (high confidence). Developing countries are expected to suffer more 
  adverse impacts than developed countries (medium confidence). A small temperature 
  increase would have net negative impacts on market sectors in many developing 
  countries (medium confidence) and net positive impacts on market sectors in 
  many developed countries (medium confidence). The different results are attributable 
  partly to differences in exposures and sensitivities (e.g., present temperatures 
  are below optimal in mid- and high latitudes for many crops but at or above 
  optimal in low latitudes) and partly to lesser adaptive capacity in developing 
  countries relative to developed countries. At a medium temperature increase, 
  net positive impacts would start to turn negative and negative impacts would 
  be exacerbated (high confidence). The results of these studies do not fully 
  take into account nonmarket impacts of climate change such as impacts on natural 
  systems, which may be sensitive to small amounts of warming. Particularly vulnerable 
  regions include deltaic regions, low-lying small island states, and many arid 
  regions where droughts and water availability are problematic even without climate 
  change. Within regions or countries, impacts are expected to fall most heavily, 
  in relative terms, on impoverished persons. The poorest members of society can 
  be inferred to be most vulnerable to climate change because of their lack of 
  resources with which to cope and adapt to impacts, but few studies have explicitly 
  examined the distribution of impacts on the poor relative to other segments 
  of society. [<a href="673.htm">19.4</a>]</p>
<p>Impacts on unmanaged systems are likely to increase in severity with time, 
  but impacts on managed systems could increase or decrease through the 21st century. 
  The distribution of impacts over the 21st century is influenced by several factors. 
  As GHG concentrations increase, the magnitude of exposure to change in climate 
  stimuli also would increase. Nonclimate pressures on natural and social systems, 
  which increase the vulnerability of systems, also may grow through time as a 
  result of population growth and increased demands for land, water, public infrastructure, 
  and other resources. Increased population, incomes, and wealth also mean that 
  more people and human-made resources potentially would be exposed to climate 
  change, which would tend to increase market-sector damages in absolute dollar 
  terms; this has been the case historically. Counteracting these tendencies are 
  factors such as increased wealth and technology and improved institutions, which 
  can raise adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability to climate change. [<a href="321.htm">8</a>, 
  <a href="673.htm">19.4</a>] </p>
<p>Whether impacts and vulnerability increase or decrease with time is likely 
  to depend in part on the rates of climate change and development and may differ 
  for managed and unmanaged systems. The more rapid the rate of climate change, 
  the greater would be future exposure to potentially adverse changes and the 
  greater the potential for exceeding system thresholds. The more rapid the rate 
  of development, the more resources would be exposed to climate change in the 
  future&#151;but so too would the adaptive capacity of future societies. The 
  benefits of increased adaptive capacity are likely to be greater for intensively 
  managed systems than for systems that presently are unmanaged or lightly managed. 
  For this reason, and because of the possibility that nonclimate pressures on 
  natural systems may increase in the future, the vulnerability of natural systems 
  is expected to increase with time (medium confidence). [<a href="674.htm">19.4.2</a>, 
  <a href="675.htm">19.4.3</a>]</p>
<p>Future development paths, sustainable or otherwise, will shape future vulnerability 
  to climate change, and climate change impacts may affect prospects for sustainable 
  development in different parts of the world. Climate change is one of many stresses 
  that confront human and natural systems. The severity of many of these stresses 
  will be determined in part by the development paths followed by human societies; 
  paths that generate lesser stresses are expected to lessen the vulnerability 
  of human and natural systems to climate change. Development also can influence 
  future vulnerability by enhancing adaptive capacity through accumulation of 
  wealth, technology, information, skills, and appropriate infrastructure; development 
  of effective institutions; and advancement of equity. Climate change impacts 
  could affect prospects for sustainable development by changing the capacity 
  to produce food and fiber, the supply and quality of water, and human health 
  and by diverting financial and human resources to adaptation. [<a href="641.htm">18</a>]</p>
