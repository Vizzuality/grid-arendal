<h4>10.2.2.2. Marine and Freshwater Fisheries</h4>
<p>African nations possess a variety of lacustrine, riverine, and marine habitats 
  with more than 800 freshwater and marine species (as noted in IPCC, 1998). GCMs 
  do not provide direct information on water quality and other hydrological parameters 
  that affect fisheries (Hlohowskyj <i>et al.,</i> 1996). As such, vulnerability 
  assessments must translate projected atmospheric changes into changes in aquatic 
  environments, making it possible for ecological and biological responses to 
  climate change to be identified and evaluated. Most studies on the potential 
  impacts of climate change on fisheries have been done for temperate-zone fisheries. 
  In these studies, the emphasis has been to evaluate the impacts of changes in 
  the availability of thermal habitat on fishery resources and evaluate the effects 
  of temperature on physiological processes of fish.</p>
<p>Temperature increases may affect lake fisheries, although sensitivity across 
  Africa is likely to vary. For example, Ntiba (1998) used empirically derived 
  models to elucidate the relationship between long-term fishery yield data with 
  climatic index value for Lakes Naivasha and Victoria in Kenya. The mean annual 
  temperature is taken as the climatic index because of data availability and 
  close correlation between air and water surface temperatures. The results indicate 
  that in Lake Victoria, mean annual temperature has greater effect on fish yields 
  than morphoedaphic index (MEI); the opposite is the case in Lake Naivasha. For 
  Lake Naivasha, a rise of as much as 2&deg;C above the current mean annual temperature 
  may not even double the yield from the current 12 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (yield regressed 
  to temperature only). The additional effect of MEI will double and triple the 
  yield with a rise of 1.5 and 2&deg;C, respectively. For Lake Victoria, the maximum 
  predicted yield under current climatic conditions is estimated to be 81.8 kg 
  ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and is predicted to more than triple to 263.7 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> with a 
  rise in temperature of 0.5&deg;C. However, natural aquatic ecosystems have a 
  finite carrying capacity at which fishery yields will reach a maximum sustainable 
  yield (MSY) (Russell and Yonge, 1975); it is unlikely that the yield will exceed 
  84.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in Lake Victoria, considering that the estimated MSY for the 
  entire lake is 74.0 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Turner, 1996).</p>
<p>On Lake Kariba, Magadza (1996) found that drought years were accompanied by 
  decreased fisheries catch. Hart and Rayner (1994) show that the distribution 
  of copepods on the African continent is temperature-dependent, with species 
  examined showing restricted temperature range preferences. In the laboratory, 
  Magadza (1977) found that the optimum temperature for the reproduction of <i>Moinia 
  dubia</i> is 24&deg;C, with temperatures exceeding 28&deg;C showing reproductive 
  failure. Chifamba (2000) found negative relationships between catch per unit 
  (CPU) effort and temperature in the pelargic <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> fishery 
  on Lake Kariba, whereas precipitation and river runoff were positively correlated 
  with CPU. These observations indicate possible depression of planktivorous pelargic 
  freshwater fisheries as a result of climate change impacts. Where such fisheries 
  constitute a signifiant protein source, such impact will bear on food security.</p>
<p>A further consideration in the possible impacts of global warming on inland 
  fisheries is the thermal behaviors of inland waters. In tropical areas, a unit 
  change in temperature elicits a greater density change per unit temperature 
  change. Thus, at the higher tropical temperatures indicated by climate models, 
  thermal stratifications are likely to be more stable. In eutrophic lakes, anoxia 
  and amonia intoxication leading to massive fish deaths&#151;as repeatedly witnessed 
  in Lake Chivero&#151;are likely to be significant (Magadza, 1997; Moyo, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Aquaculture is a food production activity with one of the highest growth rates 
  in the world. Risk management in aquaculture must take into account the level 
  and frequencies of extreme events in assessing available technical options, 
  based on the environment and climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Riverine fisheries will be affected. With a potential warming of 3-5&deg;C 
  projected for the next century, productivity of the Gambia River is estimated 
  to increase by about 13-21% (Jallow <i>et al.</i>, 1999). There would be 
  little or no effect on the suitability of the present habitat for some fish 
  and shrimp species. In contrast, warming of more than 3&deg;C will have negative 
  impacts on habitats for catfish, and warming of more than 4&deg;C will reduce 
  the suitability of the present habitat for herring. Shrimp yield is estimated 
  to increase by about 38-54%.</p>
<p>Upwelling of the Canary Current produced by the northeast and southwest tradewinds 
  makes the fishery off the coast of Morocco one of the most productive in the 
  world. Data from the Institut National de Recherche Haleutique du Maroc show 
  that NAO weakens the upwelling, increases temperature, and reduces sardine stocks 
  (Hilmi <i>et al., </i>1998).</p>
<p>The pelagic fishing industry in the southwest of Africa (based on the Benguela 
  upwelling) contains several migratory species, such as the anchovy (Crawford 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1987). These species are an important resource in their own right, 
  but they also are a key element in the food chain of larger fish, seals, and 
  birds. Recruitment in these species is influenced by water temperature, and 
  growth is affected by the state of the upwelling, both of which are linked to 
  global climatic conditions (Shannon <i>et al., </i>1990; Siegfried <i>et al.,</i> 
  1990). For instance, there is a phenomenon similar to the El Ni&ntilde;o effect 
  on the fisheries of Peru that leads to an intrusion of warm, nutrient-poor water 
  from the north in some years, which severely depresses fish yields (Shannon<i> 
  et al.,</i> 1990). The net impact of global climate change on southern African 
  fisheries remains unclear because the potential impact on ocean circulation 
  and wind shear in the coastal zone is uncertain. In the event of major reorganization 
  of the circulation of the southern oceans (Hirst, 1999)&#151;which is a possibility 
  at high rates of warming&#151;the impacts most likely would be severe.</p>
