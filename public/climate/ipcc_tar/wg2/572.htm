<h4><a name="152423"></a>15.2.4.2.3. Respiratory disorders</h4>
<p>In 1997, approximately 107 million people in the United States lived in counties 
  that did not meet air quality standards for at least one regulated pollutant 
  (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). Climate change increases smog (NRC, 1991; Sillman 
  and Samson, 1995; USEPA, 1998a; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000) and acidic deposition. 
  Climate change is likely to have a positive (worsening) effect on suspended 
  particulates (Maarouf and Smith, 1997). These changes would have an impact on 
  human health. However, at this time there are too few studies on the effect 
  climate change will have on all pollutants to project human health impacts. 
  Studies (Bates and Sitzo, 1987, 1989; Tseng <i>et al</i>., 1992; Burnett <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994; Delfino <i>et al</i>., 1994, 1997; Schwartz, 1994; Thurston <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994) have demonstrated that hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses 
  are increased during contemporary air pollution episodes, when levels of ozone, 
  acid aerosols, or particulates are elevated (Campbell <i>et al</i>., 1995). 
</p>
<p>Adaptive measures to changing pollution levels include federal legislation 
  and warnings for the general population and susceptible individuals (Patz <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000).</p>
<h6><a name="1524231"></a>15.2.4.2.3.1. Smog </h6>
<p>More than half of all Canadians live in areas in which ground-level ozone may 
  reach unacceptable levels during the summer months (Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Peak 1-hour concentrations during typical pollution episodes in the Windsor-Quebec 
  City corridor often reach 150 ppb. Windsor exceeds standards for ozone air quality 
  (82 ppb) 30 days yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small> on average. In the Lower Fraser 
  Valley, ozone concentrations typically are in the 90-110 ppb range during 
  pollution episodes. In the Southern Atlantic region, peak hourly ozone concentrations 
  are in the 90-150 ppb range (Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>

<p><a name="fig152"></a>Two expert panels from the Canadian Smog Advisory Program 
  have listed a wide range of health effects of ground-level ozone at levels that 
  plausibly may occur in Canada. These effects include pulmonary inflammation, 
  pulmonary function decrements, airway hyper-reactivity, respiratory symptoms, 
  possible increased medication use and physician/emergency room visits among 
  individuals with heart or lung disease, reduced exercise capacity, increased 
  hospital admissions, and possible increased mortality (Stieb <i>et al</i>., 
  1995). The panels conceptualized potential health effects of air pollution as 
  occurring in a logical "cascade" or "pyramid," ranging from 
  severe, uncommon events (e.g., death) to mild, common effects (e.g., eye, nose, 
  and throat irritation) and asymptomatic changes of unclear clinical significance 
  (e.g., small pulmonary function decrements and pulmonary inflammation) (American 
  Thoracic Society, 1985; Bates, 1992). <br>
</p>
<p>Healthy persons can demonstrate effects from ozone exposure when they have 
  an increased respiratory rate (e.g., when they are involved in strenuous activities 
  outdoors) (Brauer <i>et al</i>., 1996). Ozone may pose a particular health threat, 
  however, to those who already suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma, 
  emphysema, or chronic bronchitis (Stieb <i>et al</i>., 1996). These three conditions 
  affect about 7.5% of the Canadian population (Ontario Lung Association, 1991). 
  Ozone also may pose a health threat to young, elderly, and cardiovascular patients 
  (Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). An increase in smog also would pose a greater 
  risk to African Americans, who have consistently higher rates of deaths and 
  emergency room visits than caucasians (Mannino <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<h6><a name="1524232"></a>15.2.4.2.3.2. Acidic deposition </h6>
<p>Acidic aerosols&#151;such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), sulfates, and 
  nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&#151;have a colloidal affinity to fine particulates, 
  which provide the vector needed to penetrate deeply into the distal lung and 
  airspaces. In general, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> have acute negative 
  impacts on the respiratory system (Campbell <i>et al</i>., 1995). </p>
<p>Several studies (Bates and Sitzo, 1987, 1989; Tseng <i>et al</i>., 1992; Burnett 
  <i>et al</i>., 1994; Delfino <i>et al</i>., 1994; Schwartz, 1994; Thurston <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994) have demonstrated that hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses 
  increase during contemporary air pollution episodes when levels of ozone, acid 
  aerosols, or particulates are elevated (Campbell <i>et al</i>., 1995). A study 
  by Raizenne <i>et al</i>. (1996) that examined the health effects of acid aerosols 
  on children living in 24 communities in the United States and Canada found that 
  long-term exposure had a deleterious effect on lung growth, development, and 
  function. Dockery <i>et al</i>. (1996) found that children living in communities 
  with the highest levels of strong particle acidity were significantly more likely 
  to report at least one episode of bronchitis in the past year compared to children 
  living in the least polluted communities.</p>
