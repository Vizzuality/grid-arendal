<h2>14.1. The Latin America Region</h2>
<h3>14.1.1. What is Unique about the Latin America Region?<a name="1411"></a></h3>
<p>The Latin American population will increase to 838 million by the year 2050. 
  Annual population growth rates will decrease from 1.68%, in the period 1995-2000, 
  to an estimated 0.51% in the period 2040-2050, according to the medium 
  prospect of the United Nations (Nawata, 1999). This signifies that the population 
  explosion will continue, even if a decerease in population growth rates were 
  possible. One of the critical difficulties caused by growing population is the 
  problem of nutrition and availability of food. Global food supply is expected 
  to meet the overall needs of the growing world population, but significant regional 
  variation in crop yields as a result of climate change (Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 
  1993) could lead to an increased risk of hunger for an additional 50 million 
  people by the year 2050. Because most Latin American countries' economies 
  depend on agricultural productivity, the issue of regional variation in crop 
  yields is very relevant for the region.</p>
<p>The area of the Latin American region is approximately 19.93 million km<sup>2</sup>&#151;double 
  that of Europe, but smaller than that of North America, Asia, or Africa. Latin 
  America includes all of the continental countries of the Americas, from Mexico 
  to Chile and Argentina, as well as adjacent seas (Canziani <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Even though the region has a predominantly southern location, Latin America 
  also has a presence in the northern hemisphere, including Mexico, Central America, 
  the Guyanas, Suriname, Venezuela, and parts of Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Latin America's orographical systems present a predominant north-south 
  orientation, extending from the ranges of Mexico and Central America to the 
  southern Andes. These features divide the region into two contrasting but interdependent 
  geosystems, influencing the climatic and hydrological patterns and making primary 
  productivity a direct dependent variable of the aforementioned environmental 
  factors (Lieth, 1976). </p>
<p>These conditions initially led to a prevalence of agricultural activities near 
  coastlines. From the end of the 19th century and the arrival of European migrations, 
  these activities were extended to inner valleys and plateaus. Pre-Colombian 
  cultures, however, had developed many of their community farming activities 
  in the high plateaus, where the largest proportion of Latin America indigenous 
  communities still are settled. </p>
<p>Mountain ranges and high plateaus play an important role in determining local 
  climates that are conditioned by altitude and orientation, which in turn enhance 
  biological diversity. Agricultural diversification also is coupled to habitat 
  heterogeneity through varying crop species and agricultural time schedules. 
  Morello (1976) has reported the way in which hunting, fishing, cattle and sheep 
  grazing, and cropping activities are correlated to discontinued habitats along 
  the altitudinal gradients in the humid tropical Andes in Colombia. Similar patterns 
  have been reported for the Andes of Ecuador (Cornik and Kirby, 1981). Mountain 
  ranges in Latin America also should be considered genetic/germoplasm banks for 
  a wide variety of plants cultivated since the pre-Hispanic period, as well as 
  for domesticated animals (llama, alpaca) and their wild relatives. The success 
  of agriculture in the Andes is based on the genetic variability of plant populations 
  and on the people themselves who have acquired the proper technology after centuries 
  of agricultural practices. This genetic variability has resulted not only in 
  a high number of cultivated species but also in a striking diversity of cultivars 
  and genotypes adapted to the environmental heterogeneity of the mountain ecosystems 
  (Blanco Gald&oacute;s, 1981). </p>
<p>Each valley or mountain range has its own characteristics, especially in the 
  tropical Andes, making the area one of the most diverse physical and biological 
  mosaics in the world. At the same time, local populations in the Andes have 
  developed appropriate technologies that are applicable in highlands agriculture; 
  these technological reservoirs are comparable only to those existing in the 
  high plateaus of Asia (Morello, 1984) </p>
<p>Earthquakes, volcanoes, and tectonic movements are common all over Latin America. 
  Some of these events may be catastrophic because urban and rural settlements 
  are likely to be devastated, but some may have positive effects. For example, 
  floods in Argentina, which originate in the high Andean watersheds, have devastating 
  effects on cultivated valleys. However, aquifers previously exhausted through 
  alfalfa irrigation become recharged, and salinized soils are washed. Furthermore, 
  volcanic eruption generates soil enrichment, which nourishes a wide range of 
  crops, including coffee in Central America and Colombia. </p>
<p>Latin America contains a large variety of climates as a result of its geographical 
  configuration. The climatic spectrum ranges from cold, icy high elevations, 
  with some of the few glaciers still found in the tropics, to temperate and tropical 
  climate. The region also has large arid and semi-arid areas. One of the most 
  important characteristics of Latin America from the climatic point of view is 
  its large sensitivity and vulnerability to ENSO events. From northern Mexico 
  to Tierra del Fuego, every country in the continent exhibits anomalous conditions 
  associated with ENSO. </p>
<p>The region also hosts the largest pluvial forest in the world: 7.5 million 
  km<sup>2</sup> constitute Amazonia, of which 6.12 million km<sup>2</sup> are 
  within the Amazon basin. The average rainfall in the Amazon basin is about 2,300 
  mm yr-<sup>1</sup>, with real evaporation estimated at 1,146-1,260 mm yr-<sup>1</sup>. 
  The Amazon is undoubtedly the world's largest river in terms of its outflow, 
  with an average annual flow rate of 209,000 m<sup>3</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>. 
  The Amazon, the Parana-Plata, and the Orinoco carry into the Atlantic Ocean 
  more than 30% of the freshwater of the world. However, these water resources 
  are poorly distributed, and extensive zones have extremely limited water resources.</p>
<p>Latin America hosts one of the largest terrestrial and marine biological diversities 
  in the world. South America has the largest fish catch on the eastern Pacific. 
  There is an important flow of krill and other plankton species as a result of 
  cold sea currents on both sides of the southern tip of South America. A combination 
  of the prevailing atmospheric and oceanic circulation defines the climate and 
  the land and sea productivity of the region. This explains the actual distribution 
  of human settlements and the availability of basic services (e.g., water supply).</p>
<p>Overall, the health profile of the Latin American population can be classified 
  as undergoing a slow epidemiological transition. At one extreme of the spectrum 
  there is a high incidence of (and mortality from) chronic noninfectious diseases 
  such as cardiovascular problems and cancer, which predominate in large metropolitan 
  areas. On the other hand, infectious diseases still impose a heavy burden on 
  the poverty-stricken parts of the population. The reasons for this dichotomy 
  are two-fold: uneven socioeconomic development within countries and the extreme 
  diversity of regional environments. </p>
<p>Latin America (and the Caribbean) has the greatest disparity in income distribution 
  in the world. A mere 5% of the population receives 25% of all national income, 
  and the top 10% receive 40%. Such proportions are comparable only to those found 
  in some African countries (IDB, 1999).</p>
<p>Many problems that have affected Latin America adversely are now showing a 
  wood-saw type of change, with some temporary improvements and downfalls. However, 
  in some countries of the region, improvement in the macroeconomy is being observed, 
  in spite of the negative impact from recent developments in Asia and some countries 
  of the region (Mexico and Brazil). Improvement currently observed in the economies 
  of Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina does not reflect the meso- and microeconomies 
  net deterioration in the living standards of rural and peri-rural urban areas. 
  The middle class, which had become a sign of progress in several countries, 
  also is adversely affected. This situation, added to the effect of extreme events, 
  has exacerbated migration toward richer cities and countries with relatively 
  better economies. Shantytowns have grown steadily around big cities, and poverty 
  belts have even tripled. Their location in flood-prone valleys and unstable 
  hills results in a lack of potable water and sanitation services, which is posing 
  a serious threat to these cities. </p>
<p>Cultural (language, traditions, religion), economic (degree of development, 
  economic systems, wealth distribution), and social (demographic growth, political 
  systems and practices, educational systems) similarities in Latin American countries 
  indicate that they could address climate change with common (shared) methods.</p>
