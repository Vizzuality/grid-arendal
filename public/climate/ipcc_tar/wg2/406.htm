<h3>10.4. Synthesis </h3>
<p>Select key impacts over the African continent are highlighted in Figure 10-10. 
  Water resources are a key vulnerability in Africa for water supply for household 
  use and for agricultural and industrial use. In shared river basins, regional 
  cooperation protocols minimize adverse impacts and potential for conflicts. 
  Land use in many of Africa's large and shared basins has long-lasting impacts 
  through modifications of the water budget and through chemical and sediment 
  input into waterways. Water issues in urban and rural areas are likely to become 
  more critical, given increasing and competing demands, as well as rapid population 
  growth. Infrastructure to store and serve water in major urban areas is mostly 
  overstretched in capacity, and extreme events such as floods that cause physical 
  damage add to the problem. Monitoring of water levels and water use is very 
  poor and limits analysis of vulnerability. </p>

<p><a name="fig1010"></a>There is wide consensus that climate change will worsen 
  food security, mainly through increased extremes and temporal/spatial shifts. 
  The continent already experiences a major deficit in food production in many 
  areas, and potential declines in soil moisture will be an added burden. Food-insecure 
  countries are at greater risk of adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Irreversible losses of biodiversity could be accelerated with climate change. 
  Climate change is expected to lead to biome shifts, with drastic shifts of biodiversity-rich 
  biomes such as the Succulent Karoo in South Africa, and many losses in species 
  in other biomes. Analysis of potential biome shifts is possible in areas where 
  good spatial databases of vegetation and biophysical variables and land use 
  are available. It is expected that these analyses will improve as more data 
  are available from new and better satellite sensing systems, as well as coordinated 
  field studies in shared resource areas.</p>
<p>Changes in temperature and rainfall will have many negative impacts on human 
  health. Changes in disease vector habitats will expose new populations to diseases 
  such as malaria. Droughts and flooding, where sanitary infrastructure is inadequate, 
  will result in increased frequency of water-borne diseases. Increased rainfall 
  could lead to more frequent outbreaks of RVF. Many African nations do not have 
  adequate financial resources for public health.</p>
<p>Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, and flooding will have 
  significant impacts for African communities and economies. Most of Africa's 
  largest cities are along coasts and are highly vulnerable to extreme events, 
  sea-level rise, and coastal erosion as a result of inadequate physical planning 
  and escalating urban drift. Rapid unplanned expansion is likely to predispose 
  large populations to infectious diseases from climate-related factors such as 
  flooding.</p>
<p>Desertification is a critical threat to sustainable resource management in 
  arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid regions of Africa, undermining food and water 
  security.</p>
<p>A diversity of constraints facing many nations limits overall adaptive capacity 
  for Africa. Although there is uncertainty about what the future holds, Africa 
  must start planning now to adapt to climate change. Current technologies and 
  approaches&#151;especially in agriculture and water&#151;are unlikely to be 
  adequate to meet projected demands, and increased climate variability will be 
  an additional stress. It is unlikely that African countries on their own will 
  have sufficient resources to respond effectively.</p>
<p>Climate change also offers some opportunities. The processes of adapting to 
  global climate change, including technology transfer and carbon sequestration, 
  offer new development pathways that could take advantage of Africa's resources 
  and human potential. Regional cooperation in science, resource management, and 
  development already are increasing, and access to international markets will 
  diversify economies and increase food security.</p>
