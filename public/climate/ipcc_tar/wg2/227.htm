<h4>5.4.3.4. Impacts on Goods and Services with Nonmarket Valuations </h4>
<p>Though difficult to measure, nonmarket values must be taken into account in 
  discussing the state of wildlife. These values can be described in terms of 
  the cultural, religious, scientific, and aesthetic importance of wildlife species 
  (Bawa and Gadgil, 1997; Goulder and Kennedy, 1997; National Research Council, 
  1999). At times, monetary value can be assigned to nonmarket aspects, such as 
  a tourist's willingness to pay to see wildlife in natural habitats (e.g., 
  Edwards, 1991). Although this is difficult, monetary values might be able to 
  be assigned to some of the wildlife services described in this section. The 
  fact that a monetary value is difficult to assign should not diminish the importance 
  of the service; for many, no substitute exists for the services provided by 
  wildlife. </p>
<p>Tools used to assess nonmarket monetary values vary, but a few approaches have 
  become common. One attempts to determine "existence value": people's 
  willingness to pay to know that an animal simply continues to exist, even if 
  they never see it (National Research Council, 1999). Similarly, an "option 
  value" is based on a person's desire to be able to potentially interact 
  with the animal some time in the future, and a "bequest value" is 
  being assured that future generations will be able to use or view an animal 
  (National Research Council, 1999). Listed below are some areas where it is particularly 
  difficult to estimate a monetary value for animal-related services. </p>
<h4><a name="54341"></a>5.4.3.4.1. Cultural and religious importance of animals</h4>
<p>Many indigenous peoples use wildlife as integral parts of their cultural and 
  religious ceremonies. For example, birds are strongly integrated into Pueblo 
  Indian (United States) communities. Birds are regarded as messengers to the 
  gods and a connection to the spirit realm. Among Zuni Indians (United States), 
  prayer sticks with feathers from 72 different species of birds are used as offerings 
  to the spirit realm (Tyler, 1991). In Boran (Kenya) ceremonies, selection of 
  tribal leaders involves rituals that require Ostrich (Struthio camelus) feathers. 
  Birds also are used for tribal cosmology, meteorology, religion, and cultural 
  ceremonies (Isack, 1987). Wildlife plays similar roles in cultures elsewhere 
  in the world. Thus, shifts in the timing or the ranges of wildlife species could 
  impact the cultural and religious lives of some indigenous peoples.</p>
<h4><a name="54342"></a>5.4.3.4.2. Wildlife and scientific information</h4>
<p>Researchers have been studying spider silk to learn how this strong and elastic 
  material could be manufactured (Xu and Lewis, 1990). Similarly, scientists have 
  examined the structure of the small scales on butterfly wings to understand 
  how they reflect light and dissipate heat. These studies may help engineers 
  design better processes for manufacturing and designing computer chips (Miaoulis 
  and Heilman, 1998). Researchers also have studied the regenerative properties 
  of cells within rhinoceros horns and have identified potent antimicrobial chemicals 
  from frogs and toads (Cruciani et al., 1992; Moore et al., 1992; Boskey, 1998). 
</p>
<h4><a name="54343"></a>5.4.3.4.3. Ecosystem function and biodiversity maintenance</h4>
<p>Other valuable services are provided by species that contribute to ecosystem 
  health and productivity. Reductions in or losses of species can lead to reduced 
  local biodiversity and changes in the structure and function of affected ecosystems 
  (National Research Council, 1999). The most well-known example of this kind 
  of effect comes from marine systems, where the presence or absence of a starfish 
  species has been found to greatly influence the species composition of intertidal 
  habitats (Paine, 1974). Species in terrestrial systems also can have a strong 
  influence on the biodiversity of their ecosystems; in many cases these effects 
  are related to their functions as pollinators or seed dispersers (see Price 
  et al., 2000). </p>
