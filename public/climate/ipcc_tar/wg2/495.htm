<h3>13.1.5. Climate Scenarios for the Future </h3>
<p>Most of the impact studies evaluated in this chapter have attempted to characterize 
  the future climate of a study region by using climate change scenarios. General 
  reviews of the development and application of climate change scenarios are provided 
  in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a> and in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/474.htm">Chapter 
  13</a>. It also should be noted that many recent impact studies in Europe have 
  followed published guidelines concerning the use of scenarios (Carter et al., 
  1994; USCSP, 1994; Smith and Hulme, 1998). This review offers a brief summary 
  first of the types of scenario information provided in European impact assessments 
  and second of research to improve this information. </p>
<h4><a name="13151"></a>13.1.5.1. Scenario Provision </h4>
<p>One or more of three broad classes of climate change scenario generally have 
  been adopted: synthetic scenarios, palaeoclimatic analogs, and scenarios that 
  are based on outputs from GCMs. The impacts of these scenario changes conventionally 
  are assessed relative to conditions under a reference or "baseline" climate 
  that represents present-day conditions (commonly 1961-1990). </p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="box"> 
      <p><b>Box 13-1. Some Key Features of Climate Scenarios for Europe </b></p>
      <p><i>Temperature </i><br>
      <ul>
        <li> Annual temperatures over Europe warm at a rate of between 0.1 and 
          0.4°C per decade. This warming of future annual climate is greatest 
          over southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece) and northeast Europe (Finland, 
          western Russia) and least along the Atlantic coastline of the continent. 
        <li> In winter, the continential interior of eastern Europe and western 
          Russia warms more rapidly (0.15-0.6°C per decade) than elsewhere. In 
          summer, the pattern of warming displays a strong south-to-north gradient, 
          with southern Europe warming at a rate of between 0.2 and 0.6°C per 
          decade and northern Europe warming between 0.08 and 0.3°C per decade. 
        <li> Winters currently classified as cold (occurring 1 year in 10 during 
          1961-1990) become much rarer by the 2020s and disappear almost entirely 
          by the 2080s. In contrast, hot summers become much more frequent. Under 
          the 2080s scenario, nearly every summer is hotter than the 1-in-10 hot 
          summer as defined under the present climate. 
        <li> The agreement between models about these future temperature changes 
          is greatest over southern Europe in winter. In summer, however, this 
          region shows the greatest level of disagreement between model simulations. 
          All model simulations show warming in the future across the whole of 
          Europe and in all seasons. 
      </ul>
      <p><i>Precipitation </i><br>
      <ul>
        <li> The general pattern of future change in annual precipitation over 
          Europe is for widespread increases in northern Europe (between +1 and 
          +2% per decade), smaller decreases across southern Europe (maximum -1% 
          per decade), and small or ambiguous changes in central Europe (France, 
          Germany, Hungary, Belarus). 
        <li> There is a marked contrast between winter and summer patterns of 
          precipitation change. Most of Europe gets wetter in the winter season 
          (between +1 and +4% per decade); the exception is the Balkans and Turkey, 
          where winters become drier. In summer, there is a strong gradient of 
          change between northern Europe (wetting of as much as +2% per decade) 
          and southern Europe (drying of as much as -5% per decade). 
        <li> The areas, however, where these changes are greater than the 2-standard 
          deviation estimate of natural 30-year time scale climate variability 
          are limited to the later periods (2050s and 2080s) and to the scenarios 
          with the larger rates of global warming (B2, A1, and A2). 
        <li> Only for the A2-high scenario are there substantial areas in Europe 
          (Fennoscandia and northwest Europe) where precipitation changes by the 
          2020s are larger than what might occur as a result of natural climate 
          variability. Even for this scenario with rapid global warming, not all 
          regions in Europe have well-defined precipitation signals from GHG-induced 
          climate change by the 2080s. 
        <li> The intermodel range of seasonal precipitation changes generally 
          is larger than the median change, implying that sign differences frequently 
          exist between the precipitation changes simulated by different climate 
          models. The largest intermodel differences tend to occur in southern 
          and northern Europe. Intermodel differences are smallest across much 
          of central Europe. 
      </ul>
      <p><i>Weather Extremes </i><br>
      <ul>
        <li> The scenarios do not explicitly quantify changes in daily weather 
          extremes. However, it is very likely that frequencies and intensities 
          of summer heat waves will increase throughout Europe; likely that intense 
          precipitation events will increase in frequency, especially in winter, 
          and that summer drought risk will increase in central and southern Europe; 
          and possible that gale frequencies will increase. 
      </ul>
      <p><i>Sea Level </i><br>
      <ul>
        <li> Global-mean sea level rises by the 2050s by 13-68 cm. These estimates 
          make no allowance for natural vertical land movements. Owing to tectonic 
          adjustments following the last glaciation, there are regional differences 
          across Europe in the natural rates of relative sea-level change. 
      </ul>

<p>Synthetic or incremental scenarios describe techniques whereby particular climatic 
  (or related) elements are changed by a realistic but arbitrary amount, often 
  according to an interpretation of climate model simulations for a region. They 
  are simple to use and can offer a useful tool for exploring the sensitivity 
  of an exposure unit to a plausible range of climatic variations. They commonly 
  are applied prior to the adoption of more detailed GCM-based scenarios. For 
  example, national assessments in CEE conducted as part of the U.S. Country Studies 
  Program adopted adjustments of present-day temperatures by +1, +2, +3, and +4°C 
  and baseline precipitation by ±5, +10, +15, and +20% (e.g., Smith and Pitts, 
  1997; Kalvová, 1995; Alexandrov, 1997). Scenarios based on GCM simulations are 
  the most widely adopted in impact studies reported from Europe. Some of these 
  studies employ scenarios that are based on equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> model 
  simulations that were conducted during the 1980s (e.g., Smith et al., 1996; 
  Tarand and Kallaste, 1998). The performance of some of these GCMs at simulating 
  current climate over Europe was examined by Smith and Pitts (1997) and Kalvová 
  and Nemesová (1997). Among the models considered, they found that the Goddard 
  Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling 
  and Analysis (CCCM) models best simulated current temperature, whereas the GISS 
  and UK89 models best simulated precipitation in northern regions and the CCCM 
  model best simulated precipitation in southern regions. </p>
<p>Scenarios from the earliest transient-response experiments with coupled atmosphere-ocean 
  GCMs (AOGCMs), which ignored historical greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, were adopted 
  in several studies that used direct model outputs (e.g., Harrison et al., 1995b) 
  or modified the outputs to account for historical forcing, using simple climate 
  models (e.g., Carter et al., 1996a; UK Department of the Environment, 1996). 
  Scenarios from transient-response experiments that explicitly account for historical 
  forcing have been adopted in the most recent impact studies (e.g., Arnell, 1999; 
  Harrison and Butterfield, 1999; Hulme et al., 1999). Some of these scenarios 
  also incorporate aerosol effects, ensemble simulations, and multidecadal climatic 
  variability. Many of these GCM results are lodged with the IPCC Data Distribution 
  Centre (DDC) and were used in developing the European scenarios of A Concerted 
  Action Towards A Comprehensive Climate Impacts and Adaptations Assessment for 
  the European Union (ACACIA).</p>
<h4><a name="13152"></a>13.1.5.2. Scenarios for Europe </h4>
<p>The climate change scenarios summarized here originally were prepared for the 
  European ACACIA project and subsequently developed further for the IPCC (Hulme 
  and Carter, 2000). The method by which they were developed is briefly described 
  in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a> of this volume and more fully in Carter et 
  al. (2000). These scenarios define a range of future European climates that 
  embrace some of the major uncertainties in future climate prediction. The scenarios 
  were placed in the context of model estimates of the natural variability of 
  European climate. The baseline period selected was 1961-1990; changes in mean 
  30-year climates were calculated for the periods centered on the 2020s (2010-2039), 
  the 2050s (2040-2069), and the 2080s (2070-2099). Each climate scenario is based 
  on one of the four preliminary SRES98 marker emissions scenarios from the IPCC 
  Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakicenovic, 2000). </p>
<p>For each scenario, season, variable, and time-slice, two maps were constructed 
  (see <a href="#fig133">Figures 13-3</a> and <a href="#fig134">13-4</a>). One 
  map shows the median change from the sample of eight standardized and scaled 
  GCM responses; the other map shows the absolute range of these eight responses. 
  The idea of signal-to-noise ratios in these regional responses was introduced 
  by comparing median scaled-GCM changes against an estimate of natural multidecadal 
  variability derived from the 1,400-year unforced climate simulation made with 
  the HadCM2 model (Stott and Tett, 1998). In the maps showing median changes, 
  only values exceeding the 2-standard deviation estimate of natural multidecadal 
  variability are plotted. <a href="#fig133">Figures 13-3</a> and <a href="#fig134">13-4</a> 
  show an example of this information for the B2-mid scenario for summer temperature 
  and precipitation. A complete set of illustrations appears in the report of 
  the European ACACIA project (Hulme and Carter, 2000). </p>

<p>To condense this scenario information further, national-scale summary graphs 
  for each European country or groups of countries have been calculated (see <a href="496.htm#fig135">Figure 
  13-5</a> for an example covering Spain, Sweden, and Poland). Each country graph 
  shows-for either winter or summer and for either the 2020s, the 2050s, or the 
  2080s-the distribution of mean changes in mean temperature and precipitation 
  for each GCM simulation and for each scenario. As with the maps, these changes 
  are compared with the natural multidecadal variability of temperature and precipitation 
  extracted from the HadCM2 1,400-year unforced simulation. These graphs provide 
  a quick assessment at a national scale of the likely range and significance 
  of future climate change and the extent to which different GCMs agree with regard 
  to their regional response to a given magnitude of global warming. </p>
<p>A contrasting future climate for Europe-the result of a rapid, nonlinear response 
  of the climate system-has been suggested. This involves an abrupt collapse of 
  the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic and consequent cooling in 
  Europe at least for the first half of the 21st century (e.g., Alcamo et al., 
  1994). Although this event has not been ruled out on theoretical grounds (see 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 11</a>), it has not 
  been simulated by any AOGCM (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>) and therefore has not been included in this assessment. </p>
