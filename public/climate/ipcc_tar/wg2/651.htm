<h3>18.5.2. Determinants of Adaptive Capacity</h3>
<p>Adaptation to climate change and risks takes place in a dynamic social, economic, 
  technological, biophysical, and political context that varies over time, location, 
  and sector. This complex mix of conditions determines the capacity of systems 
  to adapt. Although scholarship on adaptive capacity is extremely limited in 
  the climate change field, there is considerable understanding of the conditions 
  that influence the adaptability of societies to climate stimuli in the fields 
  of hazards, resource management, and sustainable development. From this literature, 
  it is possible to identify the main features of communities or regions that 
  seem to determine their adaptive capacity: economic wealth, technology, information 
  and skills, infrastructure, institutions, and equity.</p>
<a name="18521"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.1. Economic Resources</h4>
<p>Whether it is expressed as the economic assets, capital resources, financial 
  means, wealth, or poverty, the economic condition of nations and groups clearly 
  is a determinant of adaptive capacity (Burton <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Kates, 2000). It 
  is widely accepted that wealthy nations are better prepared to bear the costs 
  of adaptation to climate change impacts and risks than poorer nations (Goklany, 
  1995; Burton, 1996). It is also recognized that poverty is directly related 
  to vulnerability (Chan and Parker, 1996; Fankhauser and Tol, 1997; Rayner and 
  Malone, 1998). Although poverty should not be considered synonymous with vulnerability, 
  it is "a rough indicator of the ability to cope" (Dow, 1992). Holmes 
  (1996) recognizes that Hong Kong's financial strength has contributed in 
  the past to its ability to better manage environmental hazards through conservation 
  and pollution control. Bohle <i>et al.</i> (1994) state that, by definition, it usually 
  is the poor who are among the most vulnerable to famine, malnutrition, and hunger. 
  Deschingkar (1998) describes a situation in India in which pastoralist communities 
  are "locked into" a vulnerable situation in part because of a lack 
  of financial power that would allow them to diversify and engage in other sources 
  of income. At a local level, Pelling (1998) concludes that the highest levels 
  of household vulnerability in coastal Guyana also are characterized by low household 
  incomes in conjunction with poor housing quality and little community organization. 
  Neighborhoods with higher levels of household income are better able to manage 
  vulnerability through the transfer of flood impacts from health to economic 
  investment and loss. Kelly and Adger (1999) demonstrate the influence of poverty 
  on a region's coping capacity; poor regions tend to have less diverse and 
  more restricted entitlements and a lack of empowerment to adapt. There is ample 
  evidence that poorer nations and disadvantaged groups within nations are especially 
  vulnerable to disasters (Banuri, 1998; Munasinghe, 2000).</p>
<a name="18522"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.2. Technology</h4>
<p>Lack of technology has the potential to seriously impede a nation's ability 
  to implement adaptation options by limiting the range of possible responses 
  (Scheraga and Grambsch, 1998). Adaptive capacity is likely to vary, depending 
  on availability and access to technology at various levels (i.e., from local 
  to national) and in all sectors (Burton, 1996). Many of the adaptive strategies 
  identified as possible in the management of climate change directly or indirectly 
  involve technology (e.g., warning systems, protective structures, crop breeding 
  and irrigation, settlement and relocation or redesign, flood control measures). 
  Hence, a community's current level of technology and its ability to develop 
  technologies are important determinants of adaptive capacity. Moreover, openness 
  to the development and utilization of new technologies for sustainable extraction, 
  use, and development of natural resources is key to strengthening adaptive capacity 
  (Goklany, 1995). For example, in the context of Asian agriculture and the impact 
  of future climate change, Iglesias <i>et al.</i> (1996) note that the development of 
  heat-resistant rice cultivars will be especially crucial. Regions with the ability 
  to develop technology have enhanced adaptive capacity.</p>
<a name="18523"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.3. Information and Skills</h4>
<p>"Successful adaptation requires a recognition of the necessity to adapt, 
  knowledge about available options, the capacity to assess them, and the ability 
  to implement the most suitable ones" (Fankhauser and Tol, 1997). In the 
  context of climate variability and change, this idea may be better understood 
  through the example of the insurance industry: As information on weather hazards 
  becomes more available and understood, it is possible to study, discuss, and 
  implement adaptation measures (Downing, 1996). Building adaptive capacity requires 
  a strong, unifying vision; scientific understanding of the problems; an openness 
  to face challenges; pragmatism in developing solutions; community involvement; 
  and commitment at the highest political level (Holmes, 1996). Lack of trained 
  and skilled personnel can limit a nation's ability to implement adaptation 
  options (Scheraga and Grambsch, 1998). In general, countries with higher levels 
  of stores of human knowledge are considered to have greater adaptive capacity 
  than developing nations and those in transition (Smith and Lenhart, 1996). Magalh&atilde;es 
  (1996) includes illiteracy along with poverty as a key determinant of low adaptive 
  capacity in northeast Brazil. Such findings have prompted Gupta and Hisschem&ouml;ller 
  (1997) to conclude that it is important, therefore, to ensure that systems are 
  in place for the dissemination of climate change and adaptation information 
  nationally and regionally and that there are forums for discussion and innovation 
  of adaptation strategies at various levels.</p>
<a name="18524"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.4. Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Adaptive capacity is likely to vary with social infrastructure (Toman and Bierbaum, 
  1996). Some researchers regard the adaptive capacity of a system as a function 
  of <i>availability of</i> and <i>access to</i> resources by decisionmakers, 
  as well as vulnerable subsectors of a population (Kelly and Adger, 1999). For 
  example, the Philippine island of Mindanao uses hydroelectric power to generate 
  more than 90% of its electricity, which in turn supports local development and 
  industry. During El Ni&ntilde;o, drought conditions resulted in suspension of 
  production by the hydroelectric plant and severely increased the economic vulnerability 
  of the region (Tiglao, 1992). In the coastal area of Hong Kong, the capacity 
  to adapt to the risk of typhoons differs for existing urban areas and for new 
  coastal land reclamation. For existing urban areas, there is no possibility 
  of retreat or accommodation, although during urban renewal the formation level 
  of the ground could be raised, thereby decreasing the vulnerability of settlements 
  (Yim, 1996). At the community level, Pelling (1997) notes that the lack of flexibility 
  "in formal housing areas where dwelling form and drainage infrastructure 
  were more fixed" reduced the capacity to respond to contemporary environmental 
  conditions.</p>
<a name="18525"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.5. Institutions</h4>
<p>O'Riordan and Jordan (1999) describe the role of institutions "as 
  a means for holding society together, giving it sense and purpose and enabling 
  it to adapt." In general, countries with well-developed social institutions 
  are considered to have greater adaptive capacity than those with less effective 
  institutional arrangements&#151;commonly, developing nations and those in transition 
  (Smith and Lenhart, 1996). The role of inadequate institutional support is frequently 
  cited in the literature as a hindrance to adaptation. Kelly and Adger (1999) 
  show how institutional constraints limit entitlements and access to resources 
  for communities in coastal Vietnam and thereby increase vulnerability. Huq <i>et al.</i> (1999) demonstrate that Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate 
  change&#151;especially in the areas of food production, settlements, and human 
  life&#151;reflecting serious constraints on adaptive capacity in the "existing 
  institutional arrangements (which) is not conducive to ease the hardship of 
  the people. Due to inherent institutional deficiencies and weaknesses in managerial 
  capacities to cope with the anticipated natural event, it would be extremely 
  difficult for the country to reduce vulnerability to climate change" (Ahmed 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Baethgen (1997) discusses an example in which the presence of 
  inconsistent and unstable agricultural policies has increased the vulnerability 
  of the food production sector in Latin America. Drastic changes in economic 
  and policy conditions are expected to make agricultural systems more vulnerable 
  to changes in climate. Parrish and Funnell (1999) note that although the local 
  agro-ecosystem in the Moroccon High Atlas region may prove resilient to climate 
  change initially, it is possible that the need to change tenure conditions and 
  other arrangements may create conflicts that are beyond the capacity of local 
  institutions to resolve. Magadza (2000) shows how adaptation options in southern 
  Africa are precluded by political and institutional inefficiencies and resulting 
  resource inequities. </p>
<p>It is generally held that established institutions in developed countries not 
  only facilitate management of contemporary climate-related risks but also provide 
  an institutional capacity to help deal with risks associated with future climate 
  change. Stakhiv (1994) states that in the water resource sector, present-day 
  strategies, demand management tools, and measures (i.e., institutions) have 
  evolved over the past 25 years and are capable of serving as a basis for adaptive 
  response strategies to climate change: "[T]he accumulation of numerous 
  small changes in the present range of water resources management practices and 
  procedures increases the flexibility for adaptation to current climate uncertainty 
  and serves as a precursor to future possible responses with an ill-defined, 
  changing climatic regime." However, some analyses are less sanguine about 
  the ability of existing institutions to efficiently deal with climate change 
  hazards. For example, Miller <i>et al.</i> (1997) note that "the time has come 
  for innovative thinking on the question of how our water allocation institutions 
  should function to improve our capacity to adapt to the uncertain but potentially 
  large impacts of global climate change on regional water supplies. Given the 
  climatic uncertainties and the very different institutional settings that have 
  developed in this country, there is no simple prescription for adaptation."</p>
<a name="18526"></a>
<h4>18.5.2.6. Equity</h4>
<p>It is frequently argued that adaptive capacity will be greater if social institutions 
  and arrangements governing the allocation of power and access to resources within 
  a community, nation, or the globe assure that access to resources is equitably 
  distributed (Ribot <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mustafa, 1998; Adger, 1999; Handmer 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Kelly and Adger, 1999; Rayner and Malone, 1999; Toth, 1999). 
  The extent to which nations or communities are "entitled" to draw 
  on resources greatly influences their adaptive capacity and their ability to 
  cope (Adger and Kelly, 1999). Some people regard the adaptive capacity of a 
  system as a function not only of the <i>availability</i> of resources but of 
  <i>access</i> to those resources by decisionmakers and vulnerable subsectors 
  of a population (Kelly and Adger, 1999). In the case of technological innovation, 
  Cyert and Kumar (1996) show that differential distribution of information within 
  an organization can impose constraints on adaptation strategies. Differentiation 
  in demographic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, 
  and health often are cited in the literature as being related to the ability 
  to cope with risk (Chan and Parker, 1996; Burton <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Scheraga 
  and Grambsch, 1998). Wisner's (1998) study of homeless people in Tokyo 
  provides an example of a situation in which inequality in access to resources 
  results in a diminished capacity to adapt to environmental risk. Homeless people 
  generally occupy marginal areas that are more vulnerable to environmental hazards. 
  An associated lack of financial resources and infrastructure restricts the availability 
  of adaptation options. A study by Bolin and Stanford (1991) draws parallel conclusions 
  about the marginalization of minority groups.</p>
<p>These determinants of adaptive capacity are not independent of each other, 
  nor are they mutually exclusive. Adaptive capacity is the outcome of a combination 
  of determinants and varies widely between countries and groups, as well as over 
  time. "Vulnerability varies spatially because national environments, housing 
  and social structure vary spatially. It varies temporally because people move 
  through different life stages with varying mixes of resources and liabilities" 
  (Uitto, 1998). Bohle <i>et al.</i> (1994) document variable vulnerability to climatic 
  variations of groups in Zimbabwe and its association with poverty, the macro-political 
  economy, and inequitable land distribution. Not only are conditions for adaptive 
  capacity diverse, they also behave differently in different countries and regions, 
  particularly depending on the level of development. These determinants represent 
  conditions that constrain or enhance the adaptive capacity and hence the vulnerability 
  of regions, nations, and communities.<br>
