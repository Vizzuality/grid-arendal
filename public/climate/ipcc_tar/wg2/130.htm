<h3>3.2.4. Use of Socioeconomic Scenarios</h3>
<p>This section presents a set of case studies that illustrates a range of specific 
  approaches to the construction of socioeconomic scenarios that are relevant 
  to climate impact assessment. </p>
<h4><a name="3241"></a>3.2.4.1. IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</h4>
<p>The IPCC's <i>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</i> (SRES) (Nakicenovic 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000) was prepared to improve on the earlier set of six IS92 
  scenarios developed in 1992 (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992). The SRES describes 
  40 scenarios in all&#151;based on an extensive literature assessment, six alternative 
  modeling approaches, and an "open process" that solicited worldwide 
  participation and feedback. The scenarios (which are described in more detail 
  in <a href="154.htm">Section 3.8</a>) cover the main demographic, economic, 
  technological, and land-use driving forces of future emissions. They include 
  emissions of all relevant GHGs plus sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon 
  monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and nonmethane volatile organic 
  hydrocarbons (VOCs). The IPCC specified that the scenarios should not include 
  future policies that explicitly address climate change. However, they necessarily 
  encompass other policies that may indirectly influence GHG sources and sinks. 
  The scenarios suggest that assumptions about technology, rather than population 
  and economic development, may be the most important driving force of future 
  emissions. </p>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios serve several purposes. First, they provide baselines 
  of socioeconomic, technological, and land-use change, in combination with emissions 
  trajectories, for the assessment of mitigation policies and measures (see <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR 
  WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Second, they can be used to drive 
  the assessment of climate change (see <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> and <a href="../wg3/124.htm">Section 
  3.8</a>). Third, they provide a global socioeconomic framework for regional-scale 
  assessment of impacts and adaptation [e.g., see the United Kingdom Climate Impacts 
  Programme (UKCIP) and European ACACIA examples, below].</p>
<h4><a name="3242"></a>3.2.4.2. UNEP Pakistan Country Study</h4>
<p>The Pakistan Environment Ministry has produced a suite of three socioeconomic 
  scenarios to inform national climate impact and adaptation planning (Government 
  of Pakistan, 1998). The scenarios focus on two reference years&#151;2020 and 
  2050&#151;and include a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators. 
  Quantitative scenarios are presented for population, economic growth, agricultural 
  production, energy demand, and industrial output. Variations in future rates 
  of literacy, health care, import tariffs, forest cover, and infrastructure are 
  expressed in qualitative terms. The 2020 scenario is the more detailed of the 
  two; it is a composite of existing national projections and scenarios produced 
  for "nonclimate" policymaking. The 2020-2050 scenarios were developed 
  for the sole purpose of informing climate impact assessments and are much less 
  detailed (Tol, 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="3243"></a>3.2.4.3. UKCIP "Nonclimate Scenarios" for Climate 
  Impact Assessment</h4>
<p>A set of "nonclimate scenarios" has been developed to provide a common 
  framework for assessing climate impacts and adaptation under the stakeholder-led 
  UKCIP (Berkhout <i>et al</i>., 1999). The scenarios were based on a broader 
  "Environmental Futures" exercise (UK National Foresight Programme, 
  1999)&#151;which, in turn, had drawn on emerging SRES work. </p>
<p>Four scenarios for the 2020s and 2050s were defined by two factors affecting 
  the capacity and willingness of society to adapt to climate change: the extent 
  to which social values reflect environmental concern and the effectiveness of 
  governance institutions. Development of the scenarios involved extensive consultations 
  with stakeholders (Lorenzoni <i>et al</i>., 2000). As a result, detailed scenario 
  characterization was confined to the 2020s. For each scenario, key national 
  indicators were developed. These indicators included population and GDP, as 
  well as more specific variables relating to land-use change, patterns of agricultural 
  activity, water demand, and investment in coastal defense. In addition, climate 
  vulnerability was assessed qualitatively in several "impact domains," 
  including agriculture, water, biodiversity, coastal zone management, and infrastructure 
  and the built environment.</p>
<p>The framework scenarios were found to be a useful starting point for subsequent 
  studies. However, the scenarios needed to be articulated in more detail to be 
  useful at the regional or sectoral level. More quantification generally was 
  required. This exercise underlined the need for scenarios to be tailored for 
  end users, while maintaining broad consistency about key indicators such as 
  population and GDP. </p>
