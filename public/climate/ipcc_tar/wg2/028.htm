<h2>3.3. Sea-Level Rise Scenarios </h2>
<p>Sea-level rise scenarios are required to evaluate a diverse range of threats 
  to human settlements, natural ecosystems, and landscape in the coastal zone. 
  Relative sea-level scenarios (i.e., sea-level rise with reference to movements 
  of the local land surface) are of most interest for impact and adaptation assessments. 
  Tide gauge and wave-height records of 50 years or more are required, along with 
  information on severe weather and coastal processes, to establish baseline levels 
  or trends. Recent techniques of satellite altimetry and geodetic leveling have 
  enhanced and standardized baseline determinations of relative sea level over 
  large areas of the globe. [<a href="148.htm">3.6.2</a>]</p>
<p>Although some components of future sea-level rise can be modeled regionally 
  by using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, the most common method of obtaining 
  scenarios is to apply global mean estimates from simple models. Changes in the 
  occurrence of extreme events such as storm surges and wave setup, which can 
  lead to major coastal impacts, sometimes are investigated by superimposing historically 
  observed events onto a rising mean sea level. More recently, some studies have 
  begun to express future sea-level rise in probabilistic terms, enabling rising 
  levels to be evaluated in terms of the risk of exceeding a critical threshold 
  of impact. [<a href="149.htm">3.6.3</a>, <a href="149.htm#364">3.6.4</a>, <a href="149.htm#365">3.6.5</a>, 
  <a href="150.htm">3.6.6</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="34"></a>3.4. Climate Scenarios</h2>
<p>Three main types of climate scenarios have been employed in impact assessments: 
  incremental scenarios, analog scenarios, and climate model-based scenarios. 
  Incremental scenarios are simple adjustments of the baseline climate according 
  to anticipated future changes that can offer a valuable aid for testing system 
  sensitivity to climate. However, because they involve arbitrary adjustments, 
  they may not be realistic meteorologically. Analogs of a changed climate from 
  the past record or from other regions may be difficult to identify and are seldom 
  applied, although they sometimes can provide useful insights into impacts of 
  climate conditions outside the present-day range. [<a href="142.htm#352">3.5.2</a>]</p>
<p>The most common scenarios use outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) 
  and usually are constructed by adjusting a baseline climate (typically based 
  on regional observations of climate over a reference period such as 1961-1990) 
  by the absolute or proportional change between the simulated present and future 
  climates. Most recent impact studies have constructed scenarios on the basis 
  of transient GCM outputs, although some still apply earlier equilibrium results. 
  The great majority of scenarios represent changes in mean climate; some recent 
  scenarios, however, also have incorporated changes in variability and extreme 
  weather events, which can lead to important impacts for some systems. Regional 
  detail is obtained from the coarse-scale outputs of GCMs by using three main 
  methods: simple interpolation, statistical downscaling, and high-resolution 
  dynamical modeling. The simple method, which reproduces the GCM pattern of change, 
  is the most widely applied in scenario development. In contrast, the statistical 
  and modeling approaches can produce local climate changes that are different 
  from large-scale GCM estimates. More research is needed to evaluate the value 
  added to impact studies of such regionalization exercises. One reason for this 
  caution is the large uncertainty of GCM projections, which requires further 
  quantification through model intercomparisons, new model simulations, and pattern 
  scaling methods. [<a href="142.htm#352">3.5.2</a>, <a href="144.htm#354">3.5.4</a>,
