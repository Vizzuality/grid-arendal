<h4>5.3.3.2. Interactive Effects of CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations, Climate Change, Soils, 
  and Biotic Factors<br>
</h4>
<h4>5.3.3.2.1. Interactive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with soils 
</h4>
<p>There is not yet any clear consensus regarding the magnitude and sign of interactions 
  between elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrient availability for crop growth. Reviews 
  of available data indicate that, on average, plants grown at high nutrient supply 
  respond more strongly to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> than nutrient-stressed plants 
  (Poorter, 1993, 1998). Nevertheless, the current rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration may help plants cope with soil nutritional deficiencies (Idso 
  and Idso, 1994) and especially with low nitrogen availability (Lloyd and Farquhar, 
  1996; Drake <i>et al</i>., 1997). Several authors emphasize that a strong increase 
  in biomass production under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be sustained in low 
  fertilizer input systems without an appropriate increase in nutrients assimilation 
  (Comins and McMurtrie, 1993; Gifford, 1994; Schimel, 1998). When other nutrients 
  are not strongly limiting, a decline in nitrogen availability could be prevented 
  by an increase in biological N2 fixation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Gifford, 
  1992, 1994). In fertile grasslands, legumes benefit more from elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  than nonfixing species, resulting in significant increases in symbiotic N2 fixation 
  (Soussana and Hartwig, 1996; Zanetti <i>et al</i>., 1996). </p>
<p>Plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> generally increase the allocation 
  of photosynthates to roots (Rogers <i>et al</i>., 1996b; Murray, 1997), which increases 
  the capacity and/or activity of belowground carbon sinks (Rogers <i>et al</i>., 1994; 
  Canadell <i>et al</i>., 1996; K&ouml;rner, 1996), enhancing root turnover (Pregitzer 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995; Loiseau and Soussana, 1999b), rhizodeposition (Cardon, 1996), 
  and mycorrhizal development (Dhillion <i>et al</i>., 1996) in some but not all systems. 
  Some measurements also have shown an increase in soil N cycling (Hungate <i>et al</i>., 1997a), in response to short-term enrichment in CO<sub>2</sub>, although 
  other studies have shown either no detectable change (Prior <i>et al</i>., 1997) or 
  even a reduction in soil N mineralization (Loiseau and Soussana, 2001). The 
  relationships between C and N turnover in soils after exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  therefore are not fully understood, and it is still a matter of debate whether 
  the availability of soil nitrogen for crop plants is reduced after a step increase 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p>
<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks result from the balance between inputs and 
  decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Residues of cotton (Torbert, <i>et 
  al</i>., 1995), soybean, and sorghum (Henning <i>et al</i>., 1996) display increased 
  C:N ratios from growth under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, which may reduce their 
  rate of decomposition in the soil and lead to an increment in ecosystem carbon 
  stocks, similar to that observed in fertile grasslands (Casella and Soussana, 
  1997; Loiseau and Soussana, 1999a). However, some studies (Newton <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; Ross <i>et al</i>., 1996, Hungate <i>et al</i>., 1997b) suggest higher 
  carbon turnover rather than a substantial net increase in soil carbon under 
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Predicted increased air and soil temperatures can be 
  expected to increase the mineralization rate of SOM fractions that are not physically 
  or chemically protected. The degree of protection of SOM varies with several 
  soil-specific factors, including structure, texture, clay mineralogy, and base 
  cation status. This may lead in the long term to negative effects on structural 
  stability, water-holding capacity, and the availability of certain nutrients 
  in the soil (see Reilly <i>et al</i>., 1996). Organic matter decomposition tends 
  to be more responsive than NPP to temperature, especially at low temperatures 
  (Kirschbaum, 2000). Within this range, any warming would stimulate organic matter 
  decomposition (carbon loss) more than NPP (carbon gain); the net response would 
  be a loss of soil carbon. Mineralization rates also are influenced by soil water 
  content. For example, lower soil moisture in Mediterranean regions (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>) would compensate temperature increase effects on carbon and nitrogen 
  mineralization (Leiros <i>et al</i>.,1999). </p>
<p>As a result of these interactions with soil processes, experiments that impose 
  sudden changes in temperature or CO<sub>2</sub> and last only a few years are 
  unlikely to predict the magnitude of long-term responses in crop productivity, 
  soil nutrients (Thornley and Cannell, 1997), and carbon sequestration (Luo and 
  Reynolds, 1999). This may imply&#151;in agreement with Walker <i>et al</i>. (1999)&#151;that 
  the actual impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on crop yields in farmers' 
  fields could be less than in earlier estimates that did not take into account 
  limitations of nutrient availability and plant-soil interactions. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="53322"></a>5.3.3.2.2. Interactions between effects of climate change 
  and soil degradation</h4>
<p>Land management will continue to be the principal determinant of SOM content 
  and susceptibility to erosion during the next few decades, but changes in vegetation 
  cover resulting from short-term changes in weather and near-term changes in 
  climate are likely to affect SOM dynamics and erosion, especially in semi-arid 
  regions (Valentin, 1996; Gregory <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>The severity, frequency, and extent of erosion are likely to be altered by 
  changes (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a>) in rainfall amount and 
  intensity and changes in wind (Gregory <i>et al</i>., 1999). Models demonstrate 
  that rill erosion is directly related to the amount of precipitation but that 
  wind erosion increases sharply above a threshold windspeed. In the U.S. corn 
  belt, a 20% increase in mean windspeed greatly increases the frequency with 
  which the threshold is exceeded and thus the frequency of erosion events (Gregory 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Thus, the frequency and intensity of storms would have 
  substantial effects on the amount of erosion expected from water and wind (Gregory 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Different conclusions might be reached for different regions. 
  Thus, before predictions can be made, it is important to evaluate models for 
  erosion and SOM dynamics (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1997). By reducing the water-holding 
  capacity and organic matter contents of soils, erosion tends to increase the 
  magnitude of nutrient and water stress. Hence, in drought-prone and low-nutrient 
  environments such as marginal croplands, soil erosion is likely (high confidence) 
  to aggravate the detrimental effects of a rise in air temperature on crop yields.</p>
<h4><a name="53323"></a>5.3.3.2.3. Interactions with weeds, pests, and diseases</h4>
<p>Modest progress has been made in understanding of pest (weeds, insects, pathogens) 
  response to climate change since the SAR. Oerke <i>et al</i>. (1995) estimate 
  preharvest losses to pests in major food and cash crops to be 42% of global 
  potential production. Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>. (2000) suggest that ranges of 
  several important crop pests in the United States have expanded since the 1970s, 
  including soybean cyst nematode and corn gray leaf blight; these expansions 
  are consistent with enabling climate trends, although there are competing explanations. 
  Promising work linking generic pest damage mechanisms with crop models is reported 
  by Teng <i>et al</i>. (1996). For example, Luo <i>et al</i>. (1995) linked the 
  BLASTSIM and CERES-RICE models to simulate the effects of climate change on 
  rice leaf blast epidemics. They found that elevated temperature increases maximum 
  blast severity and epidemics in cool subtropical zones; it inhibits blast development 
  in warm humid subtropics. Such model linkages have been used to examine climate 
  change impacts on weed-crop competition (e.g., for rice-weed interactions see 
  Graf <i>et al</i>., 1990) and insect pests (Venette and Hutchison, 1999; Sutherst 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Any direct yield gain caused by increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
  could be partly offset by losses caused by phytophagous insects, pathogens, 
  and weeds. Fifteen studies of crop plants showed consistent decreases in tissue 
  nitrogen in high CO<sub>2</sub> treatments; the decreases were as much as 30%. 
  This reduction in tissue quality resulted in increased feeding damage by pest 
  species by as much as 80% (Lincoln <i>et al</i>., 1984, 1986; Osbrink <i>et 
  al</i>., 1987; Coviella and Trumble, 1999). Conversly, seeds and their herbivores 
  appear unaffected (Akey <i>et al</i>., 1988). In general, leaf chewers (e.g., 
  lepidoptera) tend to perform poorly (Osbrink <i>et al</i>., 1987; Akey and Kimball, 
  1989; Tripp <i>et al</i>., 1992; Boutaleb Joutei <i>et al</i>., 2000), whereas 
  suckers (e.g., aphids) tend to show large population increases (Heagle <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994; Awmack <i>et al</i>., 1997a; Bezemer and Jones, 1998)&#151;indicating 
  that pest outbreaks may be less severe for some species but worse for others 
  under high CO<sub>2</sub>. It is important to consider these biotic constraints 
  in studies on crop yield under climate change. Nearly all previous climate change 
  studies excluded pests (Coakley <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
