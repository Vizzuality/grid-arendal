<p><a name="fig166"></a>An increase in temperature is likely to lead to shifts 
  in species assemblages. Organisms that are unable to tolerate the present low-temperature 
  regime will invade the Southern Ocean. Some that already are there will exhibit 
  increased rates of growth. Predicted reductions in the extent and thickness 
  of sea ice will have ramifications not only for the organisms directly associated 
  with sea ice but also for those that rely on oceanographic processes that are 
  driven by sea-ice production. In the open ocean, there is a correlation between 
  the standing crop and productivity of phytoplankton with wind speed (Dickson 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Diatoms&#151;the dominant phytoplanktonic organisms in 
  the Southern Ocean&#151;have high sinking rates and require a turbulent mixed 
  zone to remain in the photic zone. If climate change results in diminution of 
  wind forcing of surface mixing, a reduced biomass of diatoms can be expected. 
  This would lead to less available food for the higher trophic levels and diminution 
  in the vertical flux of carbon and silicon. Together, these effects are likely 
  to have a profound impact on Antarctic organisms at all trophic levels, from 
  algae to the great whales. </p>
<p>Any reduction in sea ice clearly represents a change in habitat for organisms 
  that are dependent on sea ice, such as Crabeater seals and Emperor penguins. 
  Some species of penguins and seals are dependent on krill production. Increased 
  ultraviolet irradiance from ozone depletion is likely to favor the growth of 
  organisms with UV-protecting pigments and/or repair mechanisms (Marchant, 1997; 
  Davidson, 1998). This will lead to a change in species composition and impact 
  trophodynamics and vertical carbon flux. Naganobu <i>et al</i>. (2000) show 
  evidence that ozone depletion impacts directly and indirectly on krill density. 
  The growth, survival, and hatching rates of penguin chicks and seal pups are 
  directly influenced by krill abundance in the sea. Animals that migrate great 
  distances, such as the great whales and seabirds, are subject to possible disruptions 
  in the timing and distribution of their food sources. Contraction of sea ice 
  may alter migration patterns but would not be expected to present a major problem 
  to such mobile animals. Other marine mammals (seals, sea lions) have life histories 
  that tie them to specific geographic features such as pupping beaches, ice fields, 
  or sub-Antarctic islands; they may be more severely affected by changes in the 
  availability of necessary habitats and prey species that result from climate 
  change.<br clear="all">
