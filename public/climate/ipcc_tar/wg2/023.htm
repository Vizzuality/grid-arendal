<h2>1.3. Approach of the Assessment </h2>
<p>The assessment process involves evaluation and synthesis of available information 
  to advance understanding of climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. 
  The information comes predominately from peer-reviewed published literature. 
  Evidence also is drawn from published, non-peer-reviewed literature and unpublished 
  sources, but only after evaluation of its quality and validity by the authors 
  of this report.</p>
<p>WGII's assessment has been conducted by an international group of experts 
  nominated by governments and scientific bodies and selected by the WGII Bureau 
  of the IPCC for their scientific and technical expertise and to achieve broad 
  geographical balance. These experts come from academia, governments, industry, 
  and scientific and environmental organizations. They participate without compensation 
  from the IPCC, donating substantial time to support the work of the IPCC. </p>

      Report. Note that regions in which small island states are located include 
      the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, and the Caribbean and Mediterranean 
      Seas. The boundary between Europe and Asia runs along the eastern Ural Mountains, 
      River Ural, and Caspian Sea. For the polar regions, the Arctic consists 
      of the area north of the Arctic Circle, including Greenland; the Antarctic 
      consists of the Antarctic continent, together with the Southern Ocean south 
      of ~58&deg;S.</td>

<p><a name="figts2"></a>This assessment is structured to examine climate change 
  impacts, adaptations, and vulnerabilities of systems and regions and to provide 
  a global synthesis of cross-system and cross-regional issues. To the extent 
  feasible, given the available literature, climate change is examined in the 
  context of sustainable development and equity. The first section sets the stage 
  for the assessment by discussing the context of climate change, methods and 
  tools, and scenarios. Individual chapters assess vulnerabilities of water systems, 
  terrestrial ecosystems (including agriculture and forestry), ocean and coastal 
  systems, human settlements (including energy and industrial sectors), insurance 
  and other financial services, and human health. A chapter is devoted to each 
  of eight major regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, 
  Europe, Latin America, North America, polar regions, and small island states. 
  These regions are shown in <a href="#figts2">Figure TS-2</a>. All of the regions 
  are highly heterogeneous, and climate change impacts, adaptive capacity, and 
  vulnerability will vary in important ways within each of the regions. The final 
  section of the report synthesizes adaptation capacity and its potential to alleviate 
  adverse impacts, enhance beneficial effects, and increase sustainable development 
  and equity and reviews information that is relevant for interpretation of Article 
  2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
  key provisions of international agreements to address climate change. The report 
  also contains a Summary for Policymakers, which provides a brief synthesis of 
  the conclusions of the report that have particular relevance to those who have 
  responsibility for making climate change response decisions. This Technical 
  Summary provides a more comprehensive summary of the assessment; it references 
  sections of the underlying report in brackets at the end of the paragraphs for 
  readers who would like more information on a particular topic. [<a href="055.htm">1.1</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="14"></a>1.4. Treatment of Uncertainties</h2>
<p><i>Since the SAR, greater emphasis has been placed on developing methods for 
  characterizing and communicating uncertainties.</i> Two approaches to evaluate 
  uncertainties are applied in the WGII assessment. A quantitative approach is 
  adopted to assess confidence levels in instances for which present understanding 
  of relevant processes, system behavior, observations, model simulations, and 
  estimates is sufficient to support broad agreement among authors of the report 
  about Bayesian probabilities associated with selected findings. A more qualitative 
  approach is used to assess and report the quality or level of scientific understanding 
  that supports a conclusion (see <a href="#boxts2">Box 2</a>). These approaches, 
  and the rationale for them, are explained in more detail in Third Assessment 
  Report: Cross-Cutting Issues Guidance Papers (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gispri.or.jp">http://www.gispri.or.jp</a>), 
  supporting material prepared by the IPCC to increase the use of consistent terms 
  and concepts within and across the Working Group volumes of the TAR. [<a href="055.htm">1.1</a>,

        <p><i>Quantitative Assessment of Confidence Levels</i></p>
        <p>In applying the quantitative approach, authors of the report assign 
          a confidence level that represents the degree of belief among the authors 
          in the validity of a conclusion, based on their collective expert judgment 
          of observational evidence, modeling results, and theory that they have 
          examined. Five confidence levels are used. In the tables of the Technical

        <p><i>Qualitative Assessment of the State of Knowledge</i></p>
        <p>In applying the <i>qualitative</i> approach, authors of the report 
          evaluate the level of scientific understanding in support of a conclusion, 
          based on the amount of supporting evidence and the level of agreement 
          among experts about the interpretation of the evidence. Four qualitative 
          classifications are employed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Well-established:</i> Models incorporate known processes, observations 
            are consistent with models, or multiple lines of evidence support 
            the finding.</li>
          <li><i>Established but incomplete:</i> Models incorporate most known 
            processes, although some parameterizations may not be well tested; 
            observations are somewhat consistent but incomplete; current empirical 
            estimates are well founded, but the possibility of changes in governing 
            processes over time is considerable; or only one or a few lines of 
            evidence support the finding.</li>
          <li><i>Competing explanations:</i> Different model<br>
            representations account for different aspects of observations or evidence 
            or incorporate different aspects of key processes, leading to competing 
            explanations.</li>
          <li><i>Speculative:</i> Conceptually plausible ideas that are not adequately 
            represented in the literature or that contain many difficult-to-reduce 
            uncertainties [<a href="055.htm#box11">Box 1-1</a>]</li>
