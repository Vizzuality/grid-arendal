<h2>1.3. How has Society Responded? </h2>
<h3><a name="131"></a>1.3.1. International Responses </h3>
<p>A primary response to concerns about climate change has been international 
  action to address the issue, particularly through the UNFCCC. International 
  action to date has focused mainly on mitigation, although adaptation is mentioned 
  in UNFCCC Article 4.1 (e) and in funding by the Global Environment Facility 
  (GEF) of adaptation studies (e.g., the Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to 
  Climate Change program). Multinational action is required because no single 
  country or small group of countries can reduce emissions sufficiently to stop 
  GHG concentrations from continuing to grow and because wherever emissions originate, 
  they affect climate globally. Because the extent and urgency of action required 
  to mitigate emissions depends on our vulnerability, a key question is the degree 
  to which human society and the natural environment are vulnerable to the potential 
  effects of climate change. </p>
<p>At the first meeting of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in 1995, governments 
  reviewed the adequacy of existing international commitments to achieve this 
  goal and decided that additional commitments were required. They established 
  the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM, 1995) to identify appropriate 
  actions for the period beyond 2000, including strengthening of commitments through 
  adoption of a protocol or another legal instrument. The AGBM process culminated 
  in adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997 (United Nations, 1997). In 
  the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries (Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC) 
  agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six GHGs by an average of 5% below 
  1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The Protocol also allowed the Parties to 
  account for the removal of GHGs by sinks resulting from direct, human-induced 
  land-use change and forestry activities, emissions trading, "joint implementation" 
  (JI) between developed countries, and a "clean development mechanism" (CDM) 
  to encourage joint emissions reduction projects between developed and developing 
  countries and a commitment to provide assistance in meeting the costs of adaptation 
  for countries deemed most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change 
  using the proceeds of the CDM (Article 12). To date, the Kyoto Protocol has 
  not entered into force. The UNFCCC also established national reporting requirements 
  for all Parties regarding their emissions and their potential vulnerabilities/adaptation 
  options. These reporting obligations are being fulfilled through preparation 
  of National Communications to the UNFCCC. </p>
<p>The foundation for any policy to address the climate change problem is information 
  on GHG emissions, the climate system and how it may change, likely impacts on 
  human activities and the environment, and the costs and co-benefits (e.g., protecting 
  primary forests not only retains stored carbon in the trees but also confers 
  the "co-benefit" of biodiversity protection; Kremen et al., 2000) of taking 
  steps to reduce GHG emissions or to change land use. To provide the best available 
  scientific information for policymakers and the public, governments established 
  the IPCC to periodically assess and summarize the state of knowledge in the 
  literature related to climate change. The IPCC completed comprehensive assessments 
  in 1990 and 1995 of the effects of human activities on the climate system, potential 
  consequences of climate for natural and human systems, and the effectiveness 
  and costs of response options (IPCC, 1990, 1996a,b,c). In addition, the IPCC 
  has prepared numerous special reports, technical papers, and methodologies on 
  topics ranging from radiative forcing of climate to technologies, policies, 
  and measures for emissions mitigation. As knowledge has progressed, IPCC assessments 
  have added a regional focus by assessing regional climate modeling and regional 
  sensitivities and adaptive capacity. </p>
<p>Other international bodies also are taking up the challenge of climate change. 
  These organizations include the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme 
  (UNEP), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the GEF, as well as a variety 
  of regional institutions. Although a primary audience for this report is those 
  who are involved in negotiating and implementing the UNFCCC and, to some extent, 
  other international agreements on global environmental problems, the report 
  also contains information that is useful to other international institutions. 
  The report has been designed to be useful in assessing potential projects and 
  opportunities for investment that will be robust to potential negative effects 
  and to emerging opportunities from climate change. </p>
<h3><a name="132"></a>1.3.2. National and Local Governmental Responses </h3>
<p>Governments have initiated a spectrum of responses, ranging from international 
  assessments of climate science, impacts, and abatement strategies (the United 
  States, for example) to implementation of a legally binding mitigation policy 
  (Sweden, for example, has implemented a domestic carbon tax on direct fuel use 
  and on fuel use in the transportation sector; see also OECD, 1999). Governments 
  also have produced country studies, vulnerability assessments of sea-level rise, 
  and national communications; carried out GHG reductions in other countries; 
  and created research opportunities and fora for exchanges of ideas and data. 
  Such management of climate-related research and educational activities has accelerated 
  in the wake of climatic assessment that suggested a discernible human influence 
  on climate (IPCC, 1996a). Similarly, many countries have implemented policies 
  for reasons unrelated to climate change that nevertheless have led to reductions 
  of GHG emissions (e.g., the ethanol program in Brazil, support to renewable 
  energy and energy efficiency in a large number of countries). With regard to 
  adaptation, the first National Communications to UNFCCC from most countries 
  contained analyses of vulnerability and adaptation options. </p>
<p>At the local level, dozens of cities-mainly in industrialized countries-have 
  adopted GHG emission reduction targets and have taken measures to implement 
  them, mostly in the energy and transport sector. In many cases, these policies 
  have been defined by coupling climate protection objectives with other, more 
  local objectives: co-benefits such as reducing air pollution, traffic congestion, 
  or waste production. Some measures, such as water conservation, are adaptive 
  (more resilient to drought) and reduce emissions (less energy for pumping). 
  The use of "social" policy instruments such as public awareness campaigns, information, 
  and technical assistance is commonplace (OECD, 1999). With regard to adaptation, 
  for example, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is promoting adaptation 
  as well as mitigation measures. </p>
<p>Many countries have developed national climate strategies that are based on 
  a diverse range of policy instruments such as economic instruments, regulation, 
  research and development, and public awareness and information. Energy efficiency, 
  fuel switching, public transportation, and renewable energies typically are 
  promoted. The government sector itself is an increasingly common target for 
  GHG mitigation, and "greening" of government purchasing policies has started 
  to take place in some countries (OECD, 1999). </p>
<p>Overall, these policies and measures to date have had limited effect on emissions, 
  probably because of their lack of integration in a truly global, long-term framework, 
  as well as continued economic growth around the world (AGBM, 1995). </p>
<h3><a name="133"></a>1.3.3. Organizational Responses </h3>
<p>Numerous private businesses have developed plans to facilitate trading of permits 
  for carbon emissions or have set up schemes to help manage CDM transactions 
  if the Kyoto Protocol is ratified or some other instrument of carbon policy 
  is put in place by some nations. Moreover, large multinational corporations 
  such as Shell International and BP Amoco have declared that they will voluntarily 
  observe elements of the Kyoto Protocol (van der Veer, 1999; Browne, 2000). International 
  scientific organizations have responded to the prospect of climate changes for 
  more than 2 decades, from the second objective of the Global Atmospheric Research 
  Program (GARP) to a series of World Climate Conferences sponsored by the World 
  Meteorological Organization and UNEP. The International Council of Scientific 
  Unions and dozens of national scientific societies have responded by creating 
  journals to publish the results of climatic assessments, organizing many meetings 
  and symposia to further our understanding of climate-related scientific issues, 
  and creating committees to help steer research in promising directions. </p>
<p>Similarly, environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) around the world 
  have initiated climate campaigns with the aim of convincing citizens and governments 
  to strengthen the Kyoto Protocol. Meanwhile, direct advertisements have appeared 
  in the media-primarily sponsored by organizations that are attempting to influence 
  public opinion to oppose the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<h3><a name="134"></a>1.3.4. Adaptive Responses </h3>
<p>Natural and human systems have adapted to spatial differences in climate. There 
  also are examples of adaptation (with varying degrees of success) to temporal 
  variations-notably, deviations from annual average conditions. Many social and 
  economic systems-including agriculture, forestry, settlements, industry, transportation, 
  human health, and water resource management-have evolved to accommodate some 
  deviations from "normal" conditions, but rarely the extremes. </p>
<p>Adaptations come in a huge variety of forms. Autonomous adaptations invariably 
  take place in reactive response (after initial impacts are manifest) to climatic 
  stimuli as a matter of course, without directed intervention by a public agency. 
  The extent to which society can rely on autonomous, private, or market adaptation 
  to reduce the costs of climate change impacts to an acceptable or nondangerous 
  level is an issue of great interest. There is little evidence to date that efficient 
  and effective adaptations to climate change risks will be undertaken autonomously 
  (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>).</p>
<p>Planned adaptations can be reactive or anticipatory (undertaken before impacts 
  are apparent). Potential adaptations include sharing losses, modifying threats, 
  preventing or decreasing effects, changing use, and changing location. There 
  are many lists of adaptation measures, initiatives, or strategies that have 
  potential to moderate impacts, if they were implemented. Such lists indicate 
  the range of strategies and measures that represent possible adaptations to 
  climate change risks in particular sectors and regions. Only in a few cases 
  have such lists of potential adaptations considered who might undertake them, 
  under what conditions might they be implemented, and how effective might they 
  be. </p>
<p>Knowledge of processes by which individuals or communities actually adapt to 
  changes in conditions over time comes largely from analog and other empirical 
  analyses. These studies indicate that autonomous adaptations tend to be incremental 
  and ad hoc, take multiple forms, occur in response to multiple stimuli (usually 
  involving a particular catalyst, rarely climate alone), and are constrained 
  by economic, social, technological, institutional, and political conditions 
</p>
<p>Although an impressive variety of adaptation initiatives have been undertaken 
  across sectors and regions, responses are not universally or equally available. 
  Adaptation options generally occur in socioeconomic sectors and systems in which 
  turnover of capital investment and operating costs is shorter, and less often 
  where long-term investment is required. Examples include purchase of more efficient 
  irrigation equipment by individual farmers in anticipation of increased evapotranspiration 
  in a warmer climate, design of bridges or dams to account for an expected increase 
  in sea level or extremes of drought and flood, purchase of insurance, abandonment 
  of insurance coverage to people living in high-risk areas such as coastlines, 
  and creation of migration corridors for species expected to be forced to migrate 
  with climate change. </p>
<p>Often more than one adaptation option is available. People rarely seem to choose 
  the best responses-those among available options that would most effectively 
  reduce losses-often because of an established preference for, or aversion to, 
  certain options. In some cases, there is limited knowledge of risks or alternative 
  adaptation strategies. In other cases, adoption of adaptive measures is constrained 
  by other priorities, limited resources, or economic or institutional barriers. 
  Recurrent vulnerabilities, in many cases with increasing damages, illustrate 
  less than perfect adaptation of systems to climatic variations and risks. Chapter 
  18 describes some evidence that the costs of adaptations to climate conditions 
  are growing. </p>
<p>Current adaptation strategies with clear applications to climate change in 
  agriculture include moisture-conserving practices, hybrid selection, and crop 
  substitution. In the water resources sector, current management practices often 
  represent useful adaptive strategies for climate change. Some analysts go further 
  to point out that certain adaptations to climate change not only address current 
  hazards but may be additionally beneficial for other reasons. Such evaluations 
  are further complicated by the existence of secondary impacts, related to the 
  adaptation itself. For example, water development projects (adaptations to water 
  supply risks) can have significant effects on local transmission of parasitic 
  diseases. Improved water supply in some rural areas of Asia has resulted in 
  a dramatic increase in Aedes mosquito breeding sites and, consequently, outbreaks 
  of dengue (<a href="649.htm#1844">Section 18.4.4</a>).</p>
