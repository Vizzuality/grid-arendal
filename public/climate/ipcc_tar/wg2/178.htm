<h3><a name="443"></a>4.4.3. Sensitivity of Demand to Climate Change</h3>
<p>Climate change is another potential influence on the demand for water. Municipal 
  demand is related to climate to a certain extent. Shiklomanov (1998) notes different 
  rates of use in different climate zones, although in making comparisons between 
  cities it is difficult to account for variation in nonclimatic controls. The 
  sensitivity of municipal demand to climate change is likely to be very dependent 
  on the uses to which the water is put. The most sensitive areas are increased 
  personal washing and&#151;more importantly in some cultures&#151;increased use 
  of water in the garden and particularly on the lawn. Studies in the UK (Herrington, 
  1996) suggest that a rise in temperature of about 1.1&deg;C by 2025 would lead 
  to an increase in average per capita domestic demand of approximately 5%&#151;in 
  addition to nonclimatic trends&#151;but would result in a larger percentage 
  increase in peak demands (demands for garden watering may be highly concentrated). 
  Boland (1997) estimated the effects of climate change on municipal demand in 
  Washington, D.C., under a range of different water conservation policies. <a href="176.htm#tab45">Table 
  4-5</a> summarizes percentage change in summer water use under the range of 
  scenarios considered. Boland (1997) concludes that the effect of climate change 
  is &#147;small&#148; relative to economic development and the effect of different 
  water conservation policies.</p>
<p>Industrial use for processing purposes is insensitive to climate change; it 
  is conditioned by technologies and modes of use. Demands for cooling water, 
  however, may be affected by climate change. Increased water temperatures will 
  reduce the efficiency of cooling, perhaps necessitating increased abstraction 
  (or, of course, changes in cooling technologies to make them more efficient).</p>
<p>Agricultural demand, particularly for irrigation water, is considerably more 
  sensitive to climate change. There are two potential effects. First, a change 
  in field-level climate may alter the need for and timing of irrigation: Increased 
  dryness may lead to increased demands, but demands could be reduced if soil 
  moisture content rises at critical times of the year. D&ouml;ll and Siebert 
  (1999) applied a global irrigation water-use model with a spatial resolution 
  of 0.5&deg;x0.5&deg; to assess the impact of climate change on net irrigation 
  requirements per unit irrigated area, with a climate change scenario based on 
  the ECHAM4 GCM. <a href="177.htm#fig43">Figure 4-3</a> shows the relative change 
  of net irrigation requirements between the present time (1961&#150;1990) and 
  2025 in all areas equipped for irrigation in 1995. Under this scenario&#151; 
  and similarly under the corresponding HadCM3 scenario&#151;net irrigation requirements 
  per unit irrigated area generally would decrease across much of the Middle East 
  and northern Africa as a result of increased precipitation, whereas most irrigated 
  areas in India would require more water. The extra irrigation requirements per 
  unit area in most parts of China would be small; the HadCM3 scenario leads to 
  a greater increase in northern China. Other climate models would give different 
  indications of regional changes in irrigation requirements. On the global scale, 
  increases and decreases in net irrigation requirements largely cancel, and there 
  is less difference between different climate models; under two scenarios considered 
  by D&ouml;ll and Siebert (2001), global net irrigation requirements would increase, 
  relative to the situation without climate change, by 3.5&#150;5% by 2025 and 
  6&#150;8% by 2075. Actual changes in withdrawals would be dependent on changes 
  in the efficiency of irrigation water use.</p>
<p>The second potential effect of climate change on irrigation demand is through 
  increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>). Higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations lower plant stomatal conductance, 
  hence increase WUE; but as indicated in <a href="165.htm">Section 4.3.3</a>, 
  this may be offset to a large extent by increased plant growth. </p>
<p>Hatch et al.(1999) assessed irrigation water requirements in Georgia, USA, 
  using a climate change scenario derived from HadCM2. This scenario produced 
  increased rainfall in most seasons, which, together with a shorter growing season 
  and the assumed effect of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, resulted in a decrease 
  in irrigation demand, ranging from just 1% by 2030 for soybean to as much as 
  20% by 2030 for corn. Along the Gulf Coast of the United States, however, the 
  same scenario implies an increase in irrigation demands (Ritschard et al., 1999). 
  Strzepek et al. (1999) also simulated decreases in irrigation requirements across 
  the U.S. cornbelt under two of three scenarios (with the decrease depending 
  on assumed irrigation use efficiency) but an increase under the third scenario. 
  These three studies together indicate considerable uncertainty in estimated 
  future irrigation withdrawals.</p>
