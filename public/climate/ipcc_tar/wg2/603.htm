<h4><a name="16234"></a>16.2.3.4. Impacts on Biology of Southern Ocean</h4>
<p>No single factor controls overall primary production in the Southern Ocean. 
  The organisms in Antarctic marine communities are similar to the inhabitants 
  of marine systems at lower latitudes, although there is substantial endemism 
  in Antarctica (Knox, 1994). Ice cover and vertical mixing influence algae growth 
  rates by modulating the flux of solar radiation (Priddle <i>et al</i>., 1992). Micronutrients, 
  especially iron, are likely to limit phytoplankton growth in some areas. Experiments 
  involving addition of iron to the ocean show dramatic increases in the biological 
  activity of phytoplankton (de Baar <i>et al</i>., 1995; Coale <i>et al</i>., 1996; Sedwick 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Findings by Boyd <i>et al</i>. (2000) demonstrate that iron supply controls 
  phytoplankton growth and community composition during the summer, but the fate 
  of algal carbon remains unknown and depends on the interplay between processes 
  that control export, remineralization, and water-mass subduction. Grazing by 
  zooplankton also may be important.</p>

        <p><b>Box 16-1. Climate Change and Fisheries</b></p>
        <p align="left">The Southern Ocean has large and productive fisheries 
          that constitute part of the global food reserve. Currently, there are 
          concerns about sustainability, especially with regard to species such 
          as Patagonian toothfish. There are likely to be considerable changes 
          in such fisheries under the combined pressures of exploitation and climate 
          change. Spawning grounds of coldwater fish species are very sensitive 
          to temperature change. Warming and infusion of more freshwater is likely 
          to intensify biological activity and growth rates of fish (Everett and 
          Fitzharris, 1998). Ultimately, this is expected to lead to an increase 
          in the catch of marketable fish and the food reserve. This could be 
          offset in the long term by nutrient loss resulting from reduced deepwater 
          exchange. Fisheries on the margin of profitability could prosper because 
          the retreat of sea ice will provide easier access to southern waters. 
          Everett and Fitzharris (1998) discuss catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) statistics 
          from the commercial krill fishery operating around South Georgia and 
          demonstrate that there is correlation with ice-edge position. The further 
          south the ice, the lower the CPUE in the following fishing season. Fedoulov 
          <i>et al</i>. (1996) report that CPUE also is related to water temperature 
          and atmospheric circulation patterns, and Loeb <i>et al</i>. (1997) document 
          the close relationships between seasonal sea-ice cover and dominance 
          of either krill or salps (pelagic tunicates). Ross <i>et al</i>. (2000) identify 
          that maximum krill growth rates are possible only during diatom blooms 
          and that production in Antarctic krill is limited by food quantity and 
          quality. Consequently, differences in the composition of the phytoplankton 
          community caused by changes in environmental conditions, including climate 
          change, will be reflected at higher trophic levels in the grazer community 
          and their levels of productivity.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Arctic fisheries are among the most productive in the 
          world. Changes in the velocity and direction of ocean currents affect 
          the availability of nutrients and disposition of larval and juvenile 
          organisms, thereby influencing recruitment, growth, and mortality. Many 
          groundfish stocks also have shown a positive response to recent climate 
          change (NRC, 1996), but Greenland turbot&#151;a species that is more 
          adapted to colder climates&#151;and King crab stocks in the eastern 
          Bering Sea and Kodiak have declined (Weller and Lange, 1999). Projected 
          climate change could halve or double average harvests of any given species; 
          some fisheries may disappear, and other new ones may develop. More warmer 
          water species will migrate poleward and compete for existing niches, 
          and some existing populations may take on a new dominance. These factors 
          may change the population distribution and value of the catch. This 
          could increase or decrease local economies by hundreds of millions of 
          dollars annually. </p>

<p><a name="box161"></a>Several of the physical controls on phytoplankton production 
  are sensitive to climate change. Although it is presently impossible to make 
  numerical predictions, these controls have been outlined in a qualitative way 
  by Priddle <i>et al</i>. (1992). They consider that projected changes in water 
  temperature and wind-induced mixing of the Southern Ocean will be too small 
  to exert much effect but that changes in sea ice are likely to be more important. 
  Release of low-salinity water from sea ice in spring and summer is responsible 
  for developing the shallow mixed layer in the sea-ice marginal zone&#151;an 
  area of the Southern Ocean that is nearly as productive as the coastal zone 
  (Arrigo <i>et al</i>., 1998)&#151;and plays a major role in supporting other 
  marine life. Projected reductions in the amount of sea ice (<a href="606.htm">Section 
  16.2.4.2</a>) may limit the development of the sea-ice marginal zone, with a 
  consequential impact on biota there. On the other hand, greater freshening of 
  the mixed ocean layer from increased precipitation, ice-sheet runoff, and ice-shelf 
  melting might have a compensating effect. It seems that the sea-ice marginal 
  zone, under-ice biota, and subsequent spring bloom will continue, but shift 
  to more southern latitudes, as a consequence of the retreat of the ice edge.<br>
</p>
<p> Research also demonstrates that the biological production of the Antarctic 
  food web is linked closely to physical aspects of the ocean and ice ecosystem. 
  Matear and Hirst (1999) point out that changes in ocean circulation will impact 
  ocean biological production. They project a reduction in biological export from 
  the upper ocean and an expansion of the ocean's oligotrophic regions. This 
  will alter the structure and composition of the marine ecosystem. For example, 
  interdecadal variations in sponge/predator population and in anchor/platelet 
  ice at depths shallower than 30 m appear to be related to alterations in regional 
  currents and ocean climate shifts (Jacobs and Giulivi, 1998). Changes in ocean 
  currents could bathe new areas of the sea floor in near-freezing water, so that 
  anchor ice and ice crystals will rise through the water column. This will be 
  a liability for some benthic species. On the other hand, there could be a fresher 
  and more stable layer, which could lead to changes in phytoplankton community 
  structure (Arrigo <i>et al</i>., 1999), and stronger ocean fronts. Both of these physical 
  changes would be beneficial to many parts of the marine ecosystem. A 20% decline 
  in winter and summer sea ice since 1973 west of the Antarctic Peninsula region 
  (Jacobs and Comiso, 1997) has led to a decline in Adelie penguins, which are 
  obligate inhabitants of pack ice. By contrast, Chinstrap penguins in open water 
  have increased in numbers (Fraser <i>et al</i>., 1992; Ainley <i>et al</i>., 1994). Krill 
  recruitment around the Antarctic Peninsula seems to be dependent on the strength 
  of the westerlies and sea-ice cover, with a 1-year lag (Naganobu <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Both will decrease in the future, so there will be less krill.<br>
</p>
<p>The direct effect of a change in temperature is known for very few Antarctic 
  organisms. Much of the investigation on ecophysiology has concentrated on adaptations 
  to living at low temperature, with relatively little attention devoted to their 
  response to increasing temperatures. Few data are available to assess quantitatively 
  the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Perhaps the best-studied 
  example of temperature affecting the abundance of marine microorganisms is the 
  increased rate of production of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus with increasing 
  temperature, which approximately doubles for an increase in temperature of 2.5&deg;C 
  (Marchant <i>et al</i>., 1987). <br>
</p>
<p> The virtual absence of cyanobacteria represents a fundamental difference between 
  the microbial loop in Antarctic waters compared to that in temperate and tropical 
  waters. As discussed by Azam <i>et al</i>. (1991), metazoan herbivores apparently 
  cannot directly graze Synechococcus; their production must be channelled through 
  heterotrophic protists able to consume this procaryote. Adding another trophic 
  step reduces the energy available to higher trophic levels. Coupled with the 
  direct utilization of nanoplankton by grazers, this may account in part for 
  high levels of tertiary production in the Southern Ocean, despite relatively 
  low levels of primary production (but see Arrigo <i>et al</i>., 1998). Any increase 
  in water temperature will increase the concentration of cyanobacteria and the 
  heterographs that graze them. It is possible that the prey for krill and other 
  grazers also will change, but the ultimate effects are unknown. Changes in the 
  microbial loop may lessen carbon drawdown because of increased respiration by 
  heterotrophs. Furthermore, there is an apparent uncoupling of bacterioplankton 
  and phytoplankton assemblages that contrasts with temperate aquatic ecosystems 
  (Bird and Kalff, 1984; Cole <i>et al</i>., 1988; Karl <i>et al</i>., 1996). 
  The structure and efficiency of the Antarctic marine food web is temporally 
  variable, and Karl (1993) has suggested that it is reasonable to expect several 
  independent (possibly overlapping in space and time) food webs. There is no 
  consensus with respect to the importance of bacteria and their consumers within 
  this food web or their degree of interaction with photoautotrops. Bird and Karl 
  (1999) have demonstrated, however, that uncoupling of the microbial loop in 
  coastal waters during the spring bloom period was the direct result of protistan 
  grazing. Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, the distinct difference 
  of the microbial loop in Antarctic waters, compared to more temperate waters, 
  suggests that climate change will have profound effects on the structure and 
  efficiency of the Southern Ocean food web.<br>
