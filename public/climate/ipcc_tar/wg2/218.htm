<h2>5.4. Wildlife in Ecosystems</h2>
<p>The overall mobility of wildlife and the fact that they are physiologically 
  constrained by temperature and moisture make them effective indicators of climatic 
  changes (Root, 1988a; Parmesan <i>et al</i>., 2000). Evidence is presented below 
  that shows that many different taxa from around the world already are exhibiting 
  recognizable changes, such as poleward and elevational range shifts and changes 
  in the timing of events such as breeding (see <a href="203.htm#tab53">Table 
  5-3</a>). Many factors (e.g., habitat conversion, pollution) pressure animals 
  (see <a href="203.htm#fig51">Figure 5-1</a>). The information that follows indicates 
  that the changes from such pressures could result in patterns that differ from 
  those created by rapid climate change, which are created by the physiological 
  constraints of organisms in response to climatic variables. For example, the 
  pattern many species are showing of general poleward movement is not likely 
  to be created by habitat conversion because such conversion generally does not 
  occur less frequently along the poleward sides of many species ranges (e.g., 
  along the northern boundaries in the northern hemisphere) than along those nearer 
  the equator. Consequently, the balance of evidence suggests that, for animals 
  that are exhibiting significant large-scale patterns of changes, the most consistent 
  explanation is recent climatic change. Thus, like the proverbial "canaries in 
  the coal mine," wildlife seem to be providing an important early indicator of 
  how ecosystems might respond to the discernible human impact on climate that 
  is contributing to its change (Santer <i>et al</i>., 1996). <br>
</p>
<p>Much of the early work on the effects of climate change on ecosystems focused 
  on vegetation. Animals (nondomestic animals or wildlife&#151;these terms are 
  used interchangeably) are important members of ecosystems and are affected by 
  weather and climate (Andrewartha and Birch, 1954). Consequently, concerns about 
  the impacts that rapid climatic change may have on wildlife and the risks these 
  changes may impose on ecosystem services are assessed and summarized in this 
  section.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="541"></a>5.4.1. State of Wildlife </h3>
<h4><a name="5411"></a>5.4.1.1. Current Status of Endangered/Extinct Animals</h4>
<p>Recent estimates indicate that 25% (~1,125 species) of the world's mammals 
  and 12% (~1,150 species) of birds are at a significant risk of global extinction 
  (Stattersfield <i>et al</i>., 1998; UNEP, 2000). One indicator of the magnitude 
  of this problem is the speed at which species at risk are being identified. 
  For example, the number of birds considered at risk has increased by almost 
  400 since 1994, and current population sizes and trends suggest an additional 
  600-900 soon could be added to these lists (IUCN, 1994; UNEP, 2000). The number 
  of animals threatened with extinction varies by region (see <a href="216.htm#tab55">Table 
  5-5</a>). Global patterns of total diversity are reflected in the number of 
  species at risk in each region, in that areas with more total species are likely 
  to have more at risk. The number of threatened invertebrates in <a href="216.htm#tab55">Table 
  5-5</a> is unrealistically low. The extinction rate of invertebrates in tropical 
  forests alone has been estimated at 27,000 yr<sup>-1</sup>, largely because 
  of habitat conversion (Wilson, 1992). <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5412"></a>5.4.1.2. Species Status from Secure to Extinction: Ranking 
  Risks </h4>
<p>Extinction often is caused by a combination of pressures acting over time (Wilson, 
  1992). Three traits of species populations that contribute to endangerment status 
  are range size, distribution of suitable habitat within the range, and population 
  size. Species that are most at risk often have small ranges, inhabit a unique 
  type of habitat or one found in isolated areas (patchy in distributions), and/or 
  typically occur at low population densities (Rabinowitz, 1981; Rabinowitz <i>et al</i>., 1986). Using these criteria, signs that a species may be at risk include 
  shrinking range, decreased availability of habitat within the range, and local 
  or widespread population declines. <br>
</p>
<p>Species with restricted habitat requirements typically are most vulnerable 
  to extinction (Pimm <i>et al</i>., 1995), including many endemic species that 
  could be lost with loss of their habitat (Wyman, 1991; Bibby <i>et al</i>., 
  1992; Stattersfield <i>et al</i>., 1998). For example, the Sundarban, the only 
  remaining habitat of Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Bangladesh, is 
  projected to decrease considerably in size as a result of rising sea levels; 
  Milliman <i>et al</i>. (1989) estimate a loss of 18% of the land by 2050 and 
  as much as 34% by 2100. For tigers and the many other species that inhabit these 
  forested wetland habitats, migration to higher ground probably would be blocked 
  by human habitation of adjacent lands (Seidensticker, 1987; ADB, 1994). Many 
  mountainous areas also have endemic species with narrow habitat requirements 
  (Dexter <i>et al</i>., 1995; Stattersfield <i>et al</i>., 1998). With warming, 
  habitats may be able to move up in elevation if the mountain is high enough. 
  If not, the habitat could be lost (Still <i>et al</i>., 1999). Some montane 
  species that are susceptible to this change include forest birds in Tanzania 
  (Seddon <i>et al</i>., 1999), Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) in 
  Central America (Hamilton, 1995), mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) 
  in Africa, and spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) in the Andes (Hamilton, 
  1995, and references therein). Protecting species that currently are vulnerable, 
  endangered, or critically endangered (see <a href="216.htm#tab55">Table 5-5</a>) 
  requires measures that, in general, reverse the trend toward rarity. Without 
  management, there is high confidence that rapid climate change, in conjunction 
  with other pressures, probably will cause many species that currently are classified 
  as critically endangered to become extinct and several of those that are labeled 
  endangered or vulnerable to become much rarer, and thereby closer to extinction, 
  in the 21st century (Rabinowitz, 1981).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5413"></a>5.4.1.3. Wildlife Ties to Goods and Services </h4>
<p>Concern that species will become rare or extinct is warranted because of the 
  goods and services provided by intact ecosystems and the species themselves. 
  Most of the goods and services provided by wildlife (e.g., pollination, natural 
  pest control; see <a href="202.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>) derive from their roles 
  within systems. Other valuable services are provided by species that contribute 
  to ecosystem stability or to ecosystem health and productivity. The recreational 
  value (e.g., sport hunting, wildlife viewing) of species is large in market 
  and nonmarket terms. Losses of species can lead to changes in the structure 
  and function of the affected ecosystems, as well as loss of revenue and aesthetics 
  (National Research Council, 1999).<br>
