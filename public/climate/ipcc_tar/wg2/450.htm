<h3>11.2.6. Human Dimensions </h3>
<h4><a name="11261"></a>11.2.6.1. Climate Extremes and Migration</h4>
<p>The impacts of climate change on Asia will place additional stress on socioeconomic 
  and physical systems. These pressures may induce change in demographic processes. 
  Demographic trends, including the stability and size of populations, will be 
  influenced directly through the impacts of climate change on human health as 
  described in <a href="447.htm">Section 11.2.5</a> and indirectly through the 
  impacts of climate change on food security and the viability of natural resource-based 
  economic activity. A further demographic response will come about through the 
  risk of extreme events on human settlements. If the incidence and magnitudes 
  of events such as droughts and coastal floods increase, there could be large-scale 
  demographic responses&#151;for example, through migration. Migration in itself 
  is not necessarily a signal of vulnerability to present-day extreme events. 
  Motivations for migration are diverse; much rural-to-urban migration in Asia 
  takes place as a result of increased economic opportunities in megacities (cities 
  with at least 8 million inhabitants). Future increases in the frequency and 
  intensity of severe weather systems as a consequence of climate change can trigger 
  mass migration, however. </p>
<p>The annual rate of growth in migration on a global scale has been greatest 
  in developing countries of south and southeast Asia. For instance, population 
  growth and land scarcity has encouraged the migration of more than 10 million 
  Bangladesh natives to neighboring Indian states during the past 2 decades. This 
  migration has been exacerbated by a series of floods and droughts affecting 
  the livelihoods of landless and poor farmers in this region. Land loss in coastal 
  areas resulting from inundation from sea-level rise as a result of climate change 
  is likely to lead to increased displacement of resident populations. Many south 
  Asian countries increasingly expect the number of internally displaced persons 
  to rise in future.</p>
<p>Immigrant labor often benefits both the donor and the host cities/ countries 
  (Connell and Conway, 2000). However, perceptions of regional/national identity, 
  language/cultural differences, and fears of unemployment may contribute to increased 
  hostilities between immigrants and nationals in years to come. Climate change 
  will act in parallel with a complex array of social, cultural, and economic 
  motivations for and impacts of migration (Pebley, 1998; Conway et al., 2000; 
  Kates, 2000). Irrespective of resource constraints in developing countries of 
  Asia, they have to better equip themselves through appropriate public education 
  and awareness programs with disaster preparedness measures, including infrastructures 
  for effective resettlement of displaced people as a consequence of weather calamities. 
</p>
<h4><a name="11262"></a>11.2.6.2. Infrastructure Linkages </h4>
<p>The urban population in Asia is growing at four to five times the rate of the 
  rural population. At this rate, more than 60% of the people in Asia will be 
  living in towns and cities by 2015. An estimated 80% of the increase will occur 
  in developing countries. The number of megacities in Asia would grow to at least 
  23 of the world's 36 by the year 2015 (United Nations, 1998). Urbanization 
  is rapid in fast-growing economies of south and southeast Asia, where the average 
  annual urban growth rate is more than 4%. The current pace and scale of change 
  often strains the capacity of local and national governments to provide even 
  the most basic services to urban residents. An estimated 25-40% of urban 
  inhabitants in developing countries today live in impoverished slums and squatter 
  settlements, with little or no access to water, sanitation, or refuse collection 
  (World Bank, 1997). </p>
<p>Basic infrastructure demand in urban corridors is likely to increase dramatically 
  in the future. Already governments in several developing countries of Asia are 
  introducing suites of acts and laws to ensure provision of adequate public services 
  and minimize adverse effects on surrounding communities and ecosystems. For 
  instance, Indonesia introduced the Spatial Use Management Act in 1992 for the 
  identification of environmentally sensitive areas&#151;where development activities 
  would be restricted&#151;and for improved planning for the location and support 
  of activities such as industrial development (Djoekardi, 1995). Developing countries 
  in Asia would soon need to develop new priorities and policies that try to address 
  demands created by the increasing number of people in cities while capitalizing 
  on the benefits of urbanization, such as economic growth and efficient delivery 
  of services. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate basic infrastructure 
  demands of urban inhabitants in many countries of Asia.</p>
