<h4>19.3.3.2. Biodiversity Hot Spots </h4>
<p>Biodiversity "hot spots" are areas that feature exceptional concentrations 
  of species, including many endemic species. Unfortunately, many such hot spots 
  also experience large habitat losses. In addition to a hot spot's economic, 
  social, and cultural significance to local people, the uniqueness of its biodiversity 
  and its high share of global biodiversity give the hot spot a global value. 
  Thus, biodiversity hot spots qualify as unique and threatened entities. </p>
<p>Myers et al. (2000) define a hot spot as an area featuring a biogeographic 
  unit that contains at least 0.5% of the world's 300,000 vascular plant 
  species as endemics and has lost 70% or more of its primary vegetation. <a href="#tab193">Table 
  19-3</a> shows that two-thirds of the hot spots listed in Myers et al. (2000) 
  are in the tropics, some of which have the highest percentage of global plants 
  (6.7%) and as much as 28% of area of habitat with primary vegetation. Arctic 
  and boreal biomes, however&#151;which are devoid of hot spots&#151;will have 
  the greatest changes in temperature and precipitation by 2100, whereas the exposure 
  of nearly all hot spots to a global change of 4&deg;C and/or 30% of precipitation 
  is ranked only 3 (on a 1 to 5 scale proposed by Sala et al., 2000). With respect 
  to biome-specific exposure, climate is expected to warm most dramatically at 
  high latitudes, change least in the tropics, and show intermediate changes in 
  other biomes. Indeed, <a href="#tab193">Table 19-3</a> shows that the tropical 
  hot spots are least vulnerable to climate change and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (0.12 and 
  0.10, respectively, on a scale of 0 to 1), whereas the eight Mediterranean and 
  savanna hot spots are at least twice as vulnerable (0.24 and 0.30 for climate 
  change and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively&#151;Sala et al., 2000). <br>
  The Cape Floral Kingdom (also called the Cape Floristic Province) and the adjacent 
  succulent Karoo in South Africa are examples of Mediterranean and savanna biodiversity 
  hot spots that very much qualify as unique and threatened entities. The Cape 
  Floral Kingdom is sixth in the world in plant richness of species (5,682 endemic 
  species&#151;Cowling and Hilton-Taylor, 1997). These hotspots are vulnerable 
  for the following reasons: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> Their mountains have no permanent snow cover to which high montane species 
    can retreat as climate warms.<br>
  <li> Montane endemic plants already are concentrated near the peaks, with little 
    or no possibility for altitudinal expansion.<br>
  <li> Endemics are concentrated in the southwestern corner of Africa, with no 
    possibility for latitudinal shifts farther south (except for the extreme southern 
    tip of the continent, which is intensively farmed). <br>
  <li> Increased frequency of fires and drought will affect many short-lived and 
    fire-sensitive species; seedlings that germinate after fires will be exposed 
    to successively more extreme climate conditions. 
</ul>
<p>The succulent Karoo flora may be effectively lost with a mean annual temperature 
  increase of 3-4&deg;C (Rutherford et al., 1999), owing to changing fire 
  regimes, loss of specialist pollinators, and increased frequency of drought. 
  Tropic hot spots that are not as sensitive as the Cape Floral Kingdom also will 
  be seriously affected if other anthropogenic drivers act synergistically (Sala 
  et al., 2000). Thus, although the hot spot analysis (Myers et al., 2000) indicates 
  that much of the problem of current and projected mass extinction could be countered 
  by protection of the 25 hot spots, the ability of these hot spots to be sources 
  of biodiversity is threatened by climate change.</p>
<h4><a name="19333"></a>19.3.3.3. Ecotones </h4>
<p>Ecotones are transition areas between adjacent but different environments: 
  habitats, ecosystems, landscapes, biomes, or ecoclimatic regions (Risser, 1993). 
  Ecotones that are unique entities in the context of climate change are transition 
  zones between ecoclimatic regions. Ecotones have narrow spatial extent, a steep 
  ecological gradient and hence high species richness (Risser, 1993), a unique 
  species combination, genetically unique populations (Lesica and Allendorf, 1994), 
  and high intra-species genetic diversity (Safriel et al., 1994).</p>

<p>Ecotones affect distant and larger areas: They regulate interactions between 
  biomes by modifying flows between them (Johnston, 1993; Risser, 1993); they 
  generate evolutionary diversity (Lesica and Allendorf, 1994); and they serve 
  as repositories of genetic diversity to be used for rehabilitation of ecosystems 
  in adjacent ecoclimatic regions if and when these ecosystems lose species because 
  of climate change (Volis et al., 1998; Kark et al., 1999). Conservation of ecotone 
  biodiversity therefore is an adaptation. Finally, although ecological changes in 
  response to climate change will occur everywhere, the signals will be detectable 
  first in ecotones (Neilson, 1993). This sensitivity makes them indicators that 
  provide early warning for other regions (Risser, 1993).</p>
<p>Although ecotones are unique in provision of climate change-related services, 
  they are threatened. Conservation traditionally is aimed at "prime" 
  core areas of biomes rather than ecotones. Even conservation efforts that are 
  directed at ecotones may not suffice, however: 47-77% of the areas of biosphere 
  reserves are predicted to experience change in ecosystem types, compared to 
  only 39-55% of the total global terrestrial area that will undergo such 
  changes (Leemans and Halpin, 1992; Halpin, 1997). </p>
<p>An example of a threatened ecotone is the desert/nondesert ecoclimatic transition 
  zone&#151;the semi-arid drylands sandwiched between arid and the dry subhumid 
  drylands (Middleton and Thomas, 1997). Semi-arid drylands are prone to desertification, 
  expressed as irreversible loss of soil productivity because of topsoil erosion 
  (see <a href="430.htm">Section 11.2.1.4</a>). Already affected by extreme soil 
  degradation are 67 Mha of semi-arid drylands (2.9% of global semi-arid area)&#151;nearly 
  as much as affected dry-subhumid drylands (28 Mha, 2.2%) and arid drylands (43 
  Mha, 2.7%&#151;Middleton and Thomas, 1997). This degradation is destroying the 
  habitats of the biodiversity assets of these ecotones, including those to be 
  conserved as an adaptation to climate change (Safriel, 1999a,b). </p>
<p>Climate change is expected to exacerbate desertification (see <a href="430.htm">Section 
  11.2.1.4</a>; Schlesinger et al., 1990; Middleton and Thomas, 1997). Reduced 
  precipitation and increased evapotranspiration will change ecotones' spatial 
  features (e.g., coalescence of patches at one side and increased fragmentation 
  at the other&#151;Neilson, 1993). Furthermore, overexploitation of vegetation 
  that is typical in semi-arid drylands (UNDP, 1998; ICCD, 1999), in synergy with 
  climate change, will further increase habitat loss and hence loss of biodiversity, 
  ecosystem services, and the potential for adaptation. Similar synergies between 
  climate change effects and other anthropogenic impacts are projected for alpine 
  ecotones (Rusek, 1993). To conclude, ecotones between biomes and within climatic 
  transition areas are unique entities; they are important for monitoring climate 
  change and for adapting to climate change, yet they are highly threatened by 
  climate change interacting with other anthropogenic stresses. </p>
