        <p align="left">Plants are responsible for the vast majority of carbon 
          uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. Most of this carbon is returned to 
          the atmosphere via a series of processes, including respiration, consumption 
          (followed by animal and microbial respiration), combustion (i.e., fires), 
          and chemical oxidation. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total 
          uptake through photosynthesis, whereas net primary productivity (NPP) 
          is the rate of accumulation of carbon after losses from plant respiration 
          and other metabolic processes in maintaining the plant's living 
          systems are taken into account. Consumption of plant material by animals, 
          fungi, and bacteria (heterotrophic respiration) returns carbon to the 
          atmosphere, and the rate of accumulation of carbon over a whole ecosystem 
          and over a whole season (or other period of time) is called net ecosystem 
          production (NEP). In a given ecosystem, NEP is positive in most years 
          and carbon accumulates, even if only slowly. However, major disturbances 
          such as fires or extreme events that cause the death of many components 
          of the biota release greater than usual amounts of carbon. The average 
          accumulation of carbon over large areas and/or long time periods is 
          called net biome productivity (NBP) (see also <a href="../wg1/098.htm#box31">Box

<p><a name="box51"></a>A large literature is developing on modeling the response 
  of ecosystems to climate and global changes. Most of these models simulate changes 
  in a small patch of land. These models are reviewed as appropriate in other 
  sections of this chapter and elsewhere in this report. The focus here is on 
  modeling changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function at global 
  or regional scales. There are several reasons for developing such models. One 
  is to estimate carbon fluxes and their contribution to the global carbon cycle. 
  This involves making estimates of NPP, net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and 
  net biome productivity (NBP) (see <a href="#box51">Box 5-1</a>). Another is 
  to develop models of feedbacks between the atmosphere and the land surface (Van 
  Minnen <i>et al</i>., 1995; Foley <i>et al</i>., 1998). Neither of these applications 
  are covered in detail in this chapter (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>). Instead, we concentrate on their application in forecasting the impacts 
  of climate change on biodiversity and the provision of other ecosystem goods 
  and services.</p>
<h4><a name="5221"></a>5.2.2.1. Two Paradigms Describing Ecosystem Responses to 
  Climate Change <br>
</h4>
<p>There are two paradigms about the way ecosystems (thus biomes) will respond 
  to global change. The ecosystem movement paradigm assumes that ecosystems will 
  migrate relatively intact to new locations that are closer analogs to their 
  current climate and environment. This paradigm clearly is a gross simplification 
  of what will actually happen, but it has the advantage that the well-demonstrated 
  relationship between ecosystem range and existing climate can be used to project 
  new ecosystem distributions under changed climate scenarios.<br>
</p>
<p>Basic ecological knowledge suggests that the ecosystem movement paradigm is 
  most unlikely to occur in reality because of different climatic tolerance of 
  species involved, including intra-species genetic variability (Crawford, 1993); 
  different longevities, including clonal regeneration (e.g., survival over 2,000 
  years by <i>Carex curvula</i>; Steinger <i>et al</i>., 1996); different migration 
  abilities (Pitelka and Plant Migration Workshop Group, 1997); and the effects 
  of invading species (Dukes and Mooney, 1999). It is an idealized working paradigm 
  that is useful for screening scenarios of climate change for potential significant 
  effects.</p>
<p>The alternative paradigm, ecosystem modification, assumes that as climate and 
  other environmental factors change there will be in situ changes in species 
  composition and dominance. These changes will occur as some species decline 
  in abundance or become locally extinct (Jackson and Weng, 1999) and others increase 
  in abundance. The longevity of individuals, the age structure of existing populations, 
  and the arrival of invading species will moderate these changes. The outcome 
  will be ecosystem types that may be quite different from those we see today. 
  Paleoecological data indicate that ecosystem types broadly similar to those 
  seen today did exist in the past (Pregitzer <i>et al</i>., 2000), but that there 
  also occurred combinations of dominant species that are not observed today (Davis, 
  1981; Jablonski and Sepkoski, 1996; Ammann <i>et al</i>., 2000; Prieto, 2000). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Numerous paleoecological studies provide evidence of important species within 
  an ecosystem responding differently to climate change. For example, the postglacial 
  migration pattern for Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. murrayana) 
  was largely elevational, with little migrational lag, whereas the more widely 
  distributed Rocky Mountain subspecies (P. contorta var. latifolia) migrated 
  both latitudinally and elevationally (Anderson, 1996). Colinvaux <i>et al</i>. 
  (1997) have interpreted pollen data to show that during glacial cooling, Andean 
  vegetation did not move upslope and downslope as belts but that plant associations 
  were reorganized as temperature-sensitive species found different centers of 
  distribution with changing temperature. Similarly, heat-intolerant plants have 
  moved in and out of the Amazonian rainforests during periods of cooling and 
  warming (Colinvaux <i>et al</i>., 2000). Colinvaux <i>et al</i>. (2000) also 
  argue that expulsion of heat-intolerant species from the lowland forests in 
  this postglacial warming already is complete and that the forest property of 
  maintaining its own microhabitat will allow high species richness to survive 
  more global warming, provided large enough tracts of forest are conserved. This 
  conclusion is at odds with some modeling studies (e.g., White <i>et al</i>., 
  1999).<br>
</p>
<p>The problem with the ecological modification paradigm is that it is very difficult 
  to use in practical forecasting of possible trends. Thus, most global and regional 
  studies assessing the potential impacts of climate change have had to use the 
  ecosystem paradigm, as illustrated in <a href="#box52">Box 5-2</a>. They also 
  tend to be limited to projecting changes in vegetation distributions, with the 
  implicit assumption that animal populations will track the vegetation components 
  of an ecosystem. However, observational and experimental studies show many cases 
  in which animals are responding to climate and environmental change well before 
  any significant changes in the vegetation (see <a href="218.htm">Section 5.4</a>).<br>

        <p><b>Box 5-2. Illustration of Use and Limitation of Ecosystem Movement 
          Models</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The study by Malcolm and Markham (2000) is a good example 
          of modeling that uses the ecosystem movement paradigm, but it also demonstrates 
          the inherent weaknesses of the approach. <br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The study uses two models of existing ecosystem distributions 
          (MAPSS and BIOME3; Neilson <i>et al</i>., 1998) and compares predicted 
          distributions at present CO<sub>2</sub> levels with the equilibrium 
          climate associated with doubled CO<sub>2</sub> as projected by several 
          general circulation models (GCMs). It avoids the naive assertion that 
          the latter climate constitutes a forecast of the future distribution 
          of ecosystems; instead, it uses the two predictions to calculate the 
          necessary rate of migration (m yr<sup>-1</sup>) for species in the ecosystems 
          to migrate to the new locations within 100 years (other time frames 
          also are explored in a sensitivity analysis). It then maps these required 
          rates to show areas where unusually high rates may be required in the 
          future if a "climatically appropriate" ecosystem is to be 
          established (referred to as "migration-stressed" locations). 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The study predicted that about 20% of the Earth's 
          surface will require migration rates greater than or equal to 1 km yr<sup>-1</sup>, 
          which is equivalent to the highest rates observed in the geological 
          past. The effects of natural barriers (e.g., lakes) or barriers resulting 
          from land-cover modification by humans are globally small but can be 
          regionally significant. Their approach also gives an indication of which 
          regions of the globe may be most likely to be migration-stressed by 
          climate change. It shows that much of the Earth's surface will 
          be "stressed" in at least one of the 14 combinations of vegetation 
          and climate models used. For some regions in the northern boreal zones 
          of Eurasia and North America, most of the models predict such stress.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The study then goes on to deal with locations where the 
          models predict that under climates applying a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> 
          scenario, current ecosystems will fall outside their climatic range 
          (referred to as "climate-stressed" locations). One must be 
          careful not to attribute specific impacts or changes to climate-stressed 
          locations. Biomes (or, more correctly, species constituting ecosystems 
          of the biome) may be able to tolerate the new climatic conditions (i.e., 
          new conditions fall within the potential niche) and thus may be relatively 
          little changed. This same proviso should be applied to migration-stressed 
          locations (i.e., existing vegetation may continue to occupy the site; 
          thus, the migratory restriction does not come into play for decades 
          to centuries).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The authors move on to equate climate-stressed locations 
          with habitat loss and conclude that 36% of the land area will be affected. 
          For aforementioned reasons, this must be regarded as an upper bound. 
          The authors then attempt to estimate the reduction in habitat patch 
          size by counting pixels affected by climate-stress in contiguous blocks 
          of the same biome type, then applying a simple species area relationship 
          to estimate species loss (see McDonald and Brown, 1992). Little reliance 
          should be placed on these estimates given the foregoing provisos and 
          the caveats listed by the authors themselves. </p>
