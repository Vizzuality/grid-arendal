<h3>8.4.2. Adaptation Issues</h3>
<p>To date, the literature does not explicitly address financial services firms 
  outside the insurance sector. There is emerging evidence that some investors 
  or businesses as a group are modifying their risk perception to incorporate 
  the potential for climate change. Partly this is driven by pension funds that 
  are filing shareholder resolutions against polluting companies or banks that 
  finance such practices (Behn, 2000). Similarly, there also is emerging evidence 
  that financial services firms are including consideration of potential climate 
  change as a risk factor in evaluating investments or developing new products 
  (World Bank, 1999; Jeucken and Bouma, 2000). However, history has shown that 
  the ability of banks and asset management firms to respond and adapt to external 
  shocks is strongly tied to the ability of those institutions to diversify risk, 
  both for themselves and for their customers. Over the past 25 years or so, financial 
  services firms have changed significantly in response to a variety of circumstances, 
  including macroeconomic disturbances of local and global proportions, advances 
  in communications and information technologies, and changing regulatory regimes 
  (Kaufman, 1992; Downing <i>et al</i>., 1999). Several types of tools can be 
  identified for managing risk: improved information and research, diversification, 
  building up reserves, and new product development.<br>
</p>
<p><i>The Role of New Product Development</i></p>
<p>Over the years, banks as a whole have demonstrated their ability to continuously 
  develop new products and services to respond to changes in their own business 
  environment as well as the changing needs of their customers (Folkerts-Landau 
  and Mathieson, 1988; Haraf and Kushmeider, 1988; Jeucken and Bouma, 2000). The 
  ability of those firms to respond and adapt to any impacts of potential climate 
  change will be determined largely by their ability to identify any changes in 
  their customers' views of asset risk and to develop new products to hedge 
  and diversify that risk. Again, the literature does not discuss explicitly which 
  specific existing products might be useful in responding to changes in risk 
  stemming from potential climate change or what types of new products might be 
  developed to respond to such potential changes in risk. However, the industry 
  continues to apply basic concepts&#151;including options, swaps, and futures 
  contracts&#151;in new and different ways to create new products that provide 
  investors and businesses with useful tools for reducing well-known and understood 
  risks (Mills, 1999, Vine <i>et al</i>., 1999). These products can range from 
  environmentally and socially screened investment funds to very sophisticated 
  derivatives that hedge against weather risks.</p>
<p>In the past few years, such weather derivatives have seen rapidly growing use 
  to hedge the risks of businesses whose sales and revenues are strongly affected 
  by the weather. Securitization is becoming more and more widely used as a means 
  of spreading risk and obtaining resources for investment banking with a secure 
  flow of income in the future. Financial institutions other than insurance companies 
  have been developing and offering such instruments in the form of catastrophe 
  bonds, for example (see <a href="339.htm#box83">Box 8-3</a>).</p>
<p>In summary, the banking industry is more likely to see climate change and the 
  possible response more as an opportunity than as a threat. In the new global 
  competition, banks and asset managers are likely to be less concerned about 
  any possible threat posed to their existing portfolios by weather extremes induced 
  by climate change and more preoccupied with adjusting to a rapidly changing 
  and increasingly competitive global market in which failure to adjust leads 
  rapidly to loss of market share and net revenue and a decline in share price 
  and shareholder value. They have little incentive to try to change the rules, 
  but they are highly motivated to respond once changes are imminent or implemented.</p>
