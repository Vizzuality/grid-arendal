<h3><a name="1524"></a>15.2.4. Human Health</h3>
<p>Global climate change would disturb the Earth's physical systems (e.g., 
  weather patterns) and ecosystems (e.g., disease vector habitats); these disturbances, 
  in turn, would pose direct and indirect risks to human health. Direct risks 
  involve climatic factors that impinge directly on human biology. Indirect risks 
  do not entail direct causal connections between climatic factors and human biology 
  (McMichael, 1996; McMichael <i>et al</i>., 1996). Health care will significantly 
  help people to adapt to climate change. Unfortunately, not everyone has adequate 
  health care; for example, in 1996, nearly 18% of Americans did not have access 
  to a doctor's office, clinic, health center, or other source of health 
  advice or treatment (Miller <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="15241"></a>15.2.4.1. Potential Direct Health Impacts of Climate Change 
</h4>
<h4><a name="152411"></a>15.2.4.1.1. Health impacts of thermal extremes </h4>
<p>In a warmer world, heat waves are expected to become more frequent and severe, 
  with cold waves becoming less frequent (Kattenberg <i>et al</i>., 1996). Increased 
  frequency and severity of heat waves may lead to an increase in illness and 
  death, particularly among the young (CDC, 1993), the elderly (Ramlow and Kuller, 
  1990; CDC, 1993; Semenza, 1999; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000), the poor (Schuman, 1972; 
  Applegate <i>et al</i>., 1981), the frail and the ill, and those who live in the top 
  floors of apartment buildings and lack access to air conditioning (Patz <i>et al</i>., 
  2000), especially in large urban areas (CDC, 1989; Grant, 1991; Canadian Public 
  Health Association, 1992; Kalkstein, 1993, 1995; Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993a,b; 
  Canadian Global Change Program, 1995; Environment Canada, 1995; Guidotti, 1996; 
  Kalkstein <i>et al</i>., 1996a,b; Tavares, 1996; Last <i>et al</i>., 1998). Other vulnerable 
  people are those who take medications that affect the body's thermoregulatory 
  ability (Marzuk <i>et al</i>., 1998; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Heat waves affect existing medical problems, not just those related to problems 
  of the respiratory or cardiovascular systems (Canadian Global Change Program, 
  1995). Morbidity&#151;such as heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat syncope or 
  fainting, and heat rash&#151;also results from heat waves (Shriner and Street, 
  1998; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>In the United States, populations in northeastern and midwestern cities may 
  experience the greatest number of heat-related illnesses and deaths in response 
  to increased summer temperatures (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). Recent episodes include 
  the heat-related deaths of 118 persons in Philadelphia in 1993 (CDC, 1993), 
  91 persons in Milwaukee in 1995, and 726 persons in Chicago in 1995 (CDC, 1995; 
  Phelps, 1996; Semenza <i>et al</i>., 1996, 1999). This follows several episodes in 
  the 1980s, particularly in 1980, 1983, and 1988 (CDC, 1995). <br>
</p>
<p>In Canada, urbanized areas in southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec could 
  be "impacted very negatively" by warmer temperatures. An "average" 
  summer in 2050 could result in 240-1,140 additional heat-related deaths 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> in Montreal, 230-1,220 in Toronto, and 80-500 in Ottawa, assuming 
  no acclimatization (Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993b). The significance of these 
  estimates is demonstrated by the fact that a total of only 183 Canadians died 
  as a result of excessive heat for the years 1965-1992 (Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Heat-related illness and death are largely preventable through behavioral adaptations, 
  such as use of air conditioners and increased intake of fluids. In the United 
  States, use of air conditioning is expected to become nearly universal by the 
  year 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997a,b). Other adaptive measures include development 
  of community-wide heat emergency plans, improved heat warning systems, and better 
  heat-related illness management plans (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that in a warmer world, cold waves are expected 
  to become less frequent. For example, in Saskatoon, Canada, the number of January 
  days with temperature below -35&deg;C could decrease from the current average 
  of 3 days yr<sup>-1</sup> to 1 day every 4 years (Hengeveld, 1995). Currently, more people 
  die of cold exposure than heat waves. Therefore, an expected decrease in cold 
  waves is likely to have a beneficial effect&#151;a decrease in weather-related 
  mortality.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="152412"></a>15.2.4.1.2. Health impacts of extreme weather events 
</h4>
<p>It has been postulated that there will be increases in the frequency and severity 
  of extreme events, which may result in an increase in deaths, injuries, toxic 
  contamination or ingestion, infectious diseases, and stress-related disorders, 
  as well as other adverse health effects associated with social disruption, environmentally 
  forced migration, and settlement in poorer urban areas (McMichael <i>et al</i>., 1996). 
  Adaptive measures to counter the health impacts of extreme events include improved 
  building codes, disaster policies, warning systems, evacuation plans, and disaster 
  relief (Noji, 1997).</p>
<h6><a name="1524121"></a>15.2.4.1.2.1. Convective storms</h6>
<p>There is some evidence of increases in the intensity or frequency of some extreme 
  events at regional scales throughout the 20th century. Frequencies of heavy 
  precipitation events have been increasing in the United States and southern 
  Canada (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 2000). Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict 
  where these storms will occur and to identify vulnerable populations. In 1997, 
  severe storms caused 600 deaths and 3,799 reported injuries in the United States. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Patients with specific allergies to grass pollen are at risk of thunderstorm-related 
  asthma (Venables <i>et al</i>., 1994; Celenza <i>et al</i>., 1996; Hajat <i>et 
  al</i>., 1997; Knox <i>et al</i>., 1997; Suphioglu, 1998). Thunderstorm-associated 
  asthma epidemics in Melbourne, Australia (1987/1989), and London, England (1994), 
  placed considerable demands on the health system. Several London health departments 
  ran out of drugs, equipment, and doctors (Davidson <i>et al</i>., 1996). It 
  is unclear if this situation could arise in North America. </p>
