<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Results from plants of Nardus stricta growing adjacent to springs in Iceland 
  indicate that they have been exposed to elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> for 
  at least 150 years. There was a reduction in photosynthetic capacity of high-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  grown plants of this grass from the vicinity of the spring, compared with plants 
  grown at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentations&#151;again linked to reduction 
  in Rubisco content and the availability of nutrients (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  Collectively, these results indicate that it is unlikely that carbon accumulation 
  will increase markedly over the long term as a result of the direct effects 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> alone (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1997). A return to summer sink activity 
  has occurred during the warmest and driest period in the past 4 decades in Alaskan 
  arctic ecosystems, thereby eliminating a net summer CO<sub>2</sub> flux to the 
  atmosphere that was characteristic of the early 1980s. The mechanisms are likely 
  to include nutrient cycling, physiological acclimatization, and reorganization 
  of populations and communities (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 2000), but these systems are 
  still net sources of CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
</p>
<p>A compounding consideration for Arctic plants is the impact of increased UV-B 
  radiation. In Arctic regions, UV-B radiation is low, but the relative increase 
  from ozone depletion is large, although the ancestors of present-day Arctic 
  plants were growing at lower latitudes with higher UV-B exposure. Over the past 
  20 years, there has been a trend of decreasing stratospheric ozone of approximately 
  10-15% in northern polar regions (Thompson and Wallace, 2000). As a first 
  approximation, a 1% decrease in ozone results in a 1.5-2% increase in UV-B 
  radiation. Damage processes to organisms are temperature-independent, whereas 
  repair processes are slowed at low temperatures. Hence, it is predicted that 
  Arctic plants may be sensitive to increased UV-B radiation, especially because 
  many individuals are long-lived and the effects are cumulative. In a study of 
  responses by Ericaceous plants to UV-B radiation, responses varied from species 
  to species and were more evident in the second year of exposure (Bjorn <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Callaghan <i>et al</i>., 1998). For unknown reasons, however, the growth of the 
  moss Hylocomium splendens is strongly stimulated by increased UV-B, provided 
  adequate moisture is available (Gehrke <i>et al</i>., 1996). Increased UV-B radiation 
  also may alter plant chemistry that could reduce decomposition rates and nutrient 
  availability (Bjorn <i>et al</i>., 1997, 1999). Soil fungi differ with regard to their 
  sensitivity to UV-B radiation, and their response also will affect the processes 
  of decomposition (Gehrke <i>et al</i>., 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to result in alterations to major biomes in the Arctic. 
  Ecosystem models suggest that the tundra will decrease by as much as two-thirds 
  of its present size (Everett and Fitzharris, 1998). On a broad scale&#151;and 
  subject to suitable edaphic conditions&#151;there will be northward expansion 
  of boreal forest into the tundra region, such that it may eventually cover more 
  than 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> of the Arctic. In northern Europe, vegetation 
  change is likely to be more complicated. This is because of the influence of 
  the geometrid moths, Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera spp., which can cause 
  large-scale defoliation of boreal forests when winter temperatures are above 
  3.6&deg;C (Neuvonen <i>et al</i>., 1999). Boreal forests are protected from geometrid 
  moths only during cold winters. Empirical models estimate that by 2050, only 
  one-third of the boreal forests of northern Europe will be protected by low 
  winter temperatures in comparsion to the proportion protected during the period 
  1961-1991 (Virtanen <i>et al</i>., 1998). However, the northward movement of forest 
  may lag changes in temperature by decades to centuries (Starfield and Chapin, 
  1996; Chapin and Starfield, 1997), as occurred for migration of different tree 
  species after the last glaciation (Delcourt and Delcourt, 1987). The species 
  composition of forests is likely to change, entire forest types may disappear, 
  and new assemblages of species may be established. Significant land areas in 
  the Arctic could have entirely different ecosystems with predicted climate changes 
  (Everett and Fitzharris, 1998). However, note that locally, climate change may 
  affect boreal forest through decreases in effective soil moisture (Weller and 
  Lange, 1999), tree mortality from insect outbreaks (Fleming and Volney, 1995; 
  Juday, 1996), probability of an increase of large fires, and changes caused 
  by thawing of permafrost. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16273"></a>16.2.7.3. Changes in Arctic Animals </h4>
<p>In the immediate future, the greatest environmental change for some parts of 
  the Arctic is likely to result from increased herding of reindeer rather than 
  climate change (Crete and Huot, 1993; Manseau <i>et al</i>., 1996; Callaghan <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Winter lichen pastures are particularly susceptible to grazing and trampling, 
  and recovery is slow, although summer pastures in tundra meadows and shrub-forb 
  assemblages are less vulnerable (Vilchek, 1997). The overall impact of climatic 
  warming on the population dynamics of reindeer and caribou ungulates is controversial. 
  One view is that there will a decline in caribou and muskoxen, particularly 
  if the climate becomes more variable (Gunn, 1995; Gunn and Skogland, 1997). 
  An alternative view is that because caribou are generalist feeders and appear 
  to be highly resilient, they should be able to tolerate climate change (Callaghan 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Arctic island caribou migrate seasonally across the sea ice between 
  Arctic islands in late spring and autumn. Less sea ice could disrupt these migrations, 
  with unforeseen consequences for species survival and gene flow.<br>
</p>
<p>The decrease in the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice in recent decades 
  may lead to changes in the distribution, age structure, and size of populations 
  of marine mammals. Seal species that use ice for resting, pup-rearing, and molting, 
  as well as polar bears that feed on seals, are particularly at risk (Tynan and 
  DeMaster, 1997). If break-up of annual ice occurs too early, seal pups are less 
  accessible to polar bears (Stirling and Lunn, 1997; Stirling <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  According to observational data, recent decreases in sea ice are more extensive 
  in the Siberian Arctic than in the Beaufort Sea, and marine mammal populations 
  there may be the first to experience climate-induced geographic shifts or altered 
  reproductive capacity (Tynan and DeMaster, 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Ice edges are biologically productive systems, with diatoms and other algae 
  forming a dense layer on the surface that sustains secondary production. Of 
  concern as ice melts is the loss of prey species of marine mammals, such as 
  Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and amphipods, that are associated with ice edges 
  (Tynan and DeMaster, 1997). The degree of plasticity within and between species 
  to adapt to these possible long-term changes in ice conditions and prey availability 
  is poorly known and requires study. Regime shifts in the ocean will impact the 
  distribution of commercially important fish stocks. Recruitment seems to be 
  significantly better in warm years than in cold years, and the same is valid 
  for growth (Loeng, 1989). The distribution of fish stocks and their migration 
  routes also could vary considerably (Buch <i>et al</i>., 1994; Vilhjalmsson, 1997).<br>
</p>
<p>For other species, such as the lesser snow goose, reproductive success seems 
  to be dependent on early-season climatic variables, especially early snowmelt 
  (Skinner <i>et al</i>., 1998). Insects will benefit from temperature increases 
  in the Arctic (Danks, 1992; Ring, 1994). Many insects are constrained from expanding 
  northward by cold temperatures, and they may quickly take advantage of a temperature 
  increase by expanding their range (Parmesan, 1998).</p>
