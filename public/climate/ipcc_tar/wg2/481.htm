<h2>12.7. Human Health </h2>
<a name="1271"></a>
<h3>12.7.1. Diseases and Injuries</h3>
<p>Impacts of climate and climate change on health can be direct or indirect. 
  Direct effects that are readily attributed to climate include heat stress and 
  the consequences of natural disasters. However, the resulting burden of disease 
  and injury may be less than that from indirect effects such as disrupted agriculture 
  and reduced food security. Positive and negative effects can be anticipated, 
  but there is insufficient evidence to state confidently what the balance will 
  be (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). We have not attempted to estimate 
  the overall economic costs of climate change impacts on health in the Australia-New 
  Zealand region because there is considerable debate about the derivation and 
  interpretation of monetary costs (see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p>Guest <i>et al.</i> (1999) compared heat-related deaths in the five major Australian 
  cities in the period 1977-1990 with those expected under different climate 
  change scenarios (CSIRO, 1996a) for the year 2030. They estimate that greenhouse-induced 
  climate change would increase climate-related deaths in the summer by a small 
  amount, but this would be more than balanced by a reduction in climate-related 
  deaths in the winter. Overall, this resulted in a decrease of 8-12% in 
  climate-attributable mortality under the CSIRO "high" scenario compared 
  to a scenario with no climate changes (but expected population changes).</p>
<p>The only study in New Zealand to date of elevated temperatures and mortality 
  was conducted by Hales <i>et al.</i> (2000). Daily numbers of deaths in Christchurch 
  were compared with measures of weather and ambient particulate pollution from 
  June 1988 to October 1993. Above the third quartile (20.5&deg;C) of summer maximum 
  temperatures, an increase of 1&deg;C was associated with a 1.3% increase (95% 
  confidence interval, 0.4-2.3%) in all-cause mortality and a slightly greater 
  increase in mortality from respiratory conditions. There was no evidence of 
  interaction between the effects of temperature and particulate air pollution. 
  Greater than expected numbers of deaths also occurred during winter days of 
  low temperature, although this was not statistically significant. This suggests 
  that cold-related deaths will be less common in a warmer climate. However, the 
  mechanisms that explain excess winter mortality are not well understood. </p>
<p>The effects of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on skin cancer, skin aging, 
  and cataracts of the eye are particularly important in New Zealand and Australia, 
  which already have the highest skin cancer rates in the world (Marks <i>et al.</i>, 
  1989). The etiology of skin cancer is not fully understood, and factors other 
  than sun exposure undoubtedly are involved. However, UV-B is a key factor. Present 
  levels of UV radiation in this region are relatively high and have been increasing 
  in the past 20 years (McKenzie <i>et al.</i>, 1999). It is expected with a high 
  degree of confidence that if UV flux at ground level increases at a faster rate 
  as a result of greenhouse-related cooling in the upper stratosphere and subsequent 
  slowdown in the breakdown of ozone-depleting substances, the incidence of melanomas 
  and other skin cancers will increase (Armstrong, 1994; Longstreth <i>et al.</i> 
  1998). Australians and New Zealanders of pale-skinned European descent will 
  be particularly vulnerable to these effects. This topic is discussed in more 
  detail in <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers of notified cases of arbovirus infections (illnesses caused by 
  insect-borne viruses) have increased in Australia in recent years (Russell, 
  1998), and exotic insect species such as <i>Aedes albopictus</i> and <i>Aedes 
  camptorhynchus</i> that are competent vectors of viruses such as dengue and 
  Ross River virus have been detected at New Zealand borders (Hearnden <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). </p>
<p>There is good evidence that the frequency of mosquito-borne infections in this 
  region is sensitive to short-term variations in climate. For example, outbreaks 
  of Ross River fever and Murray Valley encephalitis in southeast Australia tend 
  to follow heavy rainfall upstream in the Murray-Darling catchment (Nicholls, 
  1993; Maelzer <i>et al.</i>, 1999). In other parts of Australia where the predominant 
  vector is the coastal mosquito <i>A. camptorhynchus</i>, variations in sea level 
  also contribute to outbreaks of illness from Ross River virus (Mackenzie <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1994). No quantitative estimates have been made of the possible impact 
  of long-term climate change on rates of vector-borne infections. However, present 
  climate change scenarios suggest that parts of Australia and New Zealand will 
  experience conditions that are more favorable to breeding and development of 
  mosquitoes (Bryan <i>et al.</i> 1996). In these areas, warmer conditions will 
  tend to extend the range of reservoir hosts, decrease the extrinsic incubation 
  period of arboviruses, and encourage outdoor exposure of humans (Weinstein, 
  1997). Therefore, it is expected with a high degree of confidence that the potential 
  for insect-borne illness will increase. Whether this potential is translated 
  into actual occurrence of disease will depend on many other factors, including 
  border security, surveillance, vector eradication programs, and effectiveness 
  of primary health care. </p>
<p>Endemic malaria was present in North Queensland and the Northern Territory 
  until early in the 20th century (Ford, 1950; Black, 1972). Vectors to transmit 
  the disease still are present in that part of Australia, and climate change 
  will favor the spread of these mosquitoes southward (Bryan <i>et al.</i>, 1996). The 
  disease-limiting factor at present is the effectiveness of local health services 
  that ensure that parasitemic individuals are treated and removed from contact 
  with mosquitoes. Therefore, climate change on its own is unlikely to cause the 
  disease to return to Australia, unless services are overwhelmed. In New Zealand 
  there currently are no mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting malaria; 
  even under global warming scenarios, the possibility of an exotic vector becoming 
  established is considered to be slight (Boyd and Weinstein, 1996). </p>
<p>Studies of the prevalence of asthma in New Zealand have shown an association 
  with average temperature (Hales <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Electorates with lower mean temperatures 
  tend to have lower levels of asthma, after adjusting for confounding factors. 
  The reason is not clear but may be related to exposure to insect allergens. 
  If this were so, warming may tend to increase the frequency of asthma, but too 
  little is known about the causes of the disease to forecast the impact of climate 
  change on asthma in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Climate change may influence the levels of several outdoor air pollutants. 
  Ozone and other photochemical oxidants are a concern in several major Australian 
  cities and in Auckland, New Zealand (Woodward <i>et al.</i>, 1995). In Brisbane, Australia, 
  current levels of ozone and particulates have been associated with increased 
  hospital admission rates (Petroeschevsky <i>et al.</i>, 1999) and daily mortality in 
  persons ages 65 and over (Simpson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Outdoor particulate pollution 
  in the winter (largely generated by household fires) has been associated with 
  increased daily mortality in Christchurch, New Zealand (Hales <i>et al.</i>, 2000). 
  Formation of photochemical smog is promoted in warmer conditions, although there 
  are many other climatic factors&#151;such as windspeed and cloud cover&#151;that 
  are at least as important as temperature but more difficult to anticipate. A 
  rise in overnight minimum temperatures may reduce the use of fires and hence 
  emissions of particulates, but it is not known how this might affect pollution 
  and population exposures.</p>
<p>Toxic algal blooms may affect humans as a result of direct contact and indirectly 
  through consumption of contaminated fish and other seafood. At present this 
  is not a major public health threat in Australia or New Zealand, but it is an 
  economic issue (because of effects on livestock and shellfish). It could affect 
  very large numbers of people (Oshima <i>et al.</i>, 1987; Sim and Wilson, 1997). No 
  work has been carried out in Australia or New Zealand relating the health effects 
  of algal blooms to climate. Elsewhere in the Pacific, it has been reported that 
  the incidence of fish poisoning (resulting from ingestion of fish contaminated 
  with ciguatoxins) is associated with ocean warming in some eastern islands, 
  but not elsewhere (Hales <i>et al.</i>, 1999). It is uncertain whether these conditions 
  will become more common in Australia and New Zealand with projected climate 
  change.</p>
<p>Since 1800, deaths specifically ascribed to climatic hazards have averaged 
  about 50 yr<sup>-1</sup> in Australia (Pittock <i>et al.</i>, 1999), of which 40% are estimated 
  to be caused by heat waves and 20% each from tropical cyclones and floods. Although 
  this is not necessarily representative of present conditions because of changing 
  population, statistical accounting, and technologies, it is an order of magnitude 
  estimate. This suggests that if heat waves, floods, storm surges, and tropical 
  cyclones do become more intense, some commensurate increase in deaths and injuries 
  is possible. Whether this will occur will depend on the adequacy of hazard warnings 
  and prevention. Statistics from other developed countries with larger populations 
  indicate a recent trend toward increasing damages but decreasing death and injury 
  from climatic hazards. Thus, hazard mitigation is possible, although it must 
  more than outweigh increased exposure resulting from larger populations in hazardous 
  areas.</p>
