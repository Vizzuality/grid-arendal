<h3>5.4.3. Responses of Wildlife and Impacts on Goods and Services</h3>
<p>Findings indicate that many animals already may be responding to local climatic 
  changes. Types of changes already observed include poleward and elevational 
  movement of ranges, changes in animal abundance, changes in body size, and shifts 
  in the timing of events such as breeding to earlier in the spring. These responses 
  have been identified by a group of studies from around the world in a variety 
  of different species (see <a href="203.htm#tab53">Table 5-3</a>). Far more information 
  is available than can be summarized here. More detail on these changes is available 
  in Hughes (2000) and Price et al. (2000).</p>
<h4><a name="5431"></a>5.4.3.1. Changes Exhibited by Animals</h4>
<p>Results from most studies that use large-scale data sets provide circumstantial 
  (e.g., correlational) evidence about the association between changes in climate-related 
  environmental factors and animal numbers or activities. Circumstantial evidence, 
  though insufficient by itself, is highly suggestive when multiple studies examining 
  a myriad of different species on all continents find similar results. Combined 
  with smaller scale studies, experimental studies, and modeling studies that 
  examine mechanistic connections between animals and climate change, the weight 
  of evidence becomes even stronger. Such is the case for wildlife already exhibiting 
  change related to climate forcings (see <a href="203.htm#tab53">Table 5-3</a>). 
  The information given in the following subsections is a sampling of the types 
  of studies that have examined the potential impacts of climate change on animals. 
  The studies were selected for taxonomic and geographic inclusiveness and are 
  not inclusive of the breadth of range of published studies. Information on more 
  studies can be found in <a href="203.htm#tab53">Table 5-3</a> and in Price et 
  al. (2000).</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 5-6. Penguins as Indicators of Climate Warming 
        in Western Antarctic </b> </div>
      <p>Midwinter surface air temperatures in the Western Antarctic Peninsula 
        (WAP) region have increased by 4-5&deg;C over the past 50 years (Smith 
        et al., 1996b). Studies confirm that the spatial and temporal patterns 
        of winter sea-ice development in the WAP have changed during this time 
        in response to rapid warming (Fraser et al., 1992; de la Mare, 1997; Jacobs 
        and Comiso, 1997; Loeb et al., 1997). Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) 
        and Ad&eacute;lie (P. adeliae) penguin populations also have changed during 
        the past 25 years. </p>
      <p>Although these two species are ecologically very similar, with diets 
        and breeding ranges that overlap in the WAP (Volkman et al., 1980), their 
        winter habitat preferences are radically different. Ad&eacute;lies are 
        obligate inhabitants of the pack ice, whereas Chinstraps are ice-intolerant, 
        preferring to remain in close association with open water (Fraser et al., 
        1992; Ainley et al., 1994). The quality and availability of winter habitat 
        is an essential determinant of survival and therefore a key factor regulating 
        seabird populations (Birkhead and Furness, 1984). Ad&eacute;lie penguins 
        have decreased by 22% whereas Chinstrap penguins have increased by more 
        than 400% over the past 25 years (Fraser and Patterson, 1997; Smith et 
        al., 1999). This pattern supports the hypothesis that the increasing availability 
        of open water as a result of warmer winters is favoring the survival of 
        Chinstraps over the ice-dependent Ad&eacute;lies (see Fraser et al., 1992).</p>
