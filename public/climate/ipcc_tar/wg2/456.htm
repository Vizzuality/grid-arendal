<h4>11.3.2.3. Temperate Asia </h4>
<p>Projected surface warming and shifts in rainfall in temperate Asia are significant 
  and will induce increases in photorespiration, maintenance respiration, and 
  saturation deficits&#151;causing stomatal closure and decline in productivity 
  (White et al., 1999). An adaptive response in the agriculture sector should 
  be an effort to breed heat-resistant crop varieties by utilizing genetic resources 
  that may be better adapted to warmer and drier conditions. Improvements in farming 
  systems, fertilizer management, and soil conservation form major adaptation 
  strategies (Lou and Lin, 1999). Research is needed to define current limits 
  to heat resistance and the feasibility of manipulating such attributes through 
  modern genetic techniques. Crop architecture and physiology may be genetically 
  altered to adapt to warmer environmental conditions. The genetic resources of 
  seeds maintained in germplasm banks may be screened to find sources of resistance 
  to changing diseases and insects, as well as tolerances to heat and water stress 
  and better compatibility with new agriculture technologies. Genetic manipulation 
  also may help to exploit the potentially beneficial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  enhancement on crop growth and water-use efficiency. </p>
<p>The process of rapid urbanization and industrialization in several Asian megacities 
  has placed enormous stress on urban infrastructure, human well-being, cultural 
  integrity, and socioeconomic arrangements. These urban cities are giant resource 
  sinks and create a large "ecological footprint" on the surrounding 
  countryside. The negative environmental impacts of expanding cities are already 
  large; as they continue to grow and become more prosperous, these impacts are 
  likely to increase. Rising levels of air and water pollution in many of the 
  large cities are considerable. Production and consumption systems that sustain 
  life in cities are largely responsible for many of these changes. As climate 
  changes, the demand for basic infrastructure facilities such as housing, electricity, 
  food supply and distribution, and drinking water supply will increase, and municipalities 
  would have a difficult time managing waste recycling and waste disposal. Development 
  policies that mitigate or avert some of these long-term problems would have 
  to be country-specific and depend heavily on the availability of infrastructure 
  resources, the size of the floating population, and sustainable behavioral changes 
  in society.</p>
<p>Climate change will impinge on a diverse, complex, and dynamic form of climatic 
  hazards such as floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and storm surges in the countries 
  of temperate Asia. Preparation for changes in climate variability should include 
  provision for the possibility of increased flooding, as well as incidences of 
  drought. The present path of development in this region is placing more fixed 
  infrastructures and economic activity within the coastal zone. This trend seems 
  to offer limited scope for adjustments against flooding in the coastal zone 
  resulting from sea-level rise. The likelihood of damage to infrastructure and 
  loss of human life because of unexpected extreme events will rise. A wide range 
  of precautionary measures at the regional and national levels&#151;including 
  awareness, perception, and the acceptability of risk factors among regional 
  communities&#151;are warranted to avert or reduce the impacts of such disasters 
  on economic and social structures. Many current technical and socioeconomic 
  barriers will need to be overcome to prevent risks to human health resulting 
  from increases in disease incidences associated with climate change.</p>
