<h3>2.7.3. Relevance and Use of DAFs in Sectoral Adaptation Decisions&#151;Selected 
  Examples</h3>
<p>Working Group II has reviewed a huge volume of climate impact assessment studies 
  conducted to date. Most of these studies investigate possible implications of 
  climate change for a single economic sector or environmental component. An increasing, 
  yet still small, fraction of these studies lists options to alleviate impacts, 
  but few take even the next step of exploring direct and indirect costs of those 
  adaptation options. Even fewer studies provide comprehensive assessments of 
  direct and indirect benefits. </p>
<p>Although these studies qualitatively indicate that many policy options proposed 
  as adaptation measures to reduce negative impacts of climate change would be 
  justified even in the absence of climate change (dubbed "no regret" 
  measures on the impacts adaptation side), to date very few have been developed 
  to the point at which comprehensive and quantitative assessment of adaptation 
  options would be possible. Nevertheless, they are a prerequisite for establishing 
  appropriate applications of the more quantitative DAFs reviewed in <a href="113.htm">Section 
  2.7.2</a>. The main reason is that, despite uncertainties of regional climate 
  change patterns and resulting impacts, some information is generated about possible 
  biophysical impacts. However, little is known about future socioeconomic sensitivity 
  and even less about future adaptive capacity. Resolving this would require fairly 
  detailed regional development scenarios to provide the broader context for sectoral 
  assessments. All these factors together make rigorous applications of quantitative 
  DAFs difficult.</p>
<p>A simple ranking of climate impact and adaptation studies according to how 
  far they get in using DA tools would start with those that are preoccupied almost 
  exclusively with impacts and casually mention some obvious adaptation options. 
  The next category would be studies that attempt to produce a comprehensive list 
  of possible adaptive measures. More advanced studies would explore positive 
  and, if they exist, negative effects of listed options and try to establish 
  at least a qualitative ranking. By assigning monetary values to those comprehensive 
  effects, CBA could help determine the optimal level of adaptation measures; 
  CEA would select the least-cost solution to provide a predetermined level of 
  adaptation objective.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most crucial area of public policy in climate change adaptation 
  is water resource management. A set of papers arranged by Frederick <i>et al</i>. 
  (1997a) looks at different aspects of climate change and water resources planning. 
  Their general conclusion is that DAFs adopted in public policy procedures of 
  water management are largely "appropriate for planning and project evaluation 
  under the prospect of climate change, but new applications and extensions of 
  some criteria may be warranted" (Frederick <i>et al</i>., 1997b). The authors 
  mention nonstationarity, interest rates, and multiple objectives as issues on 
  which progress is required to support better assessments of climate change adaptation 
  decisions.</p>
<p>Water is an important factor to consider in most other sectoral impact and 
  adaptation assessments, even if their primary focus is on a single sector. With 
  a view to the complexity of interactions among sectoral impacts on one hand 
  and adaptation measures on the other, integrated regional assessments increasingly 
  are considered to be indispensable to understand climate-related risks.</p>
