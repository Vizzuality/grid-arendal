<h3>1.5.7. Discounting </h3>
<p>Comparing impact, mitigation, and adaptation costs that occur at different 
  points in time requires them to be discounted. There is longstanding debate 
  about the appropriate rate of discount to use (e.g., Arrow et al., 1996; Portney 
  and Weyant, 1999). Uncertainty regarding the discount rate relates not to calculation 
  of its effects, which is mathematically precise, but to a value judgment about 
  the appropriateness of the present generation valuing various services for future 
  generations (see <a href="080.htm">Section 2.3.1</a> for elaboration). </p>
<p>Two different approaches to discounting are presented in the SAR (Arrow et 
  al., 1996). The descriptive approach focuses on intertemporal cost-efficiency, 
  and the discount rate is based on observed market interest rates. The prescriptive 
  approach emphasizes that normative issues are involved in valuing the future. 
  One important problem for both approaches is the fact that we cannot observe 
  future market interest rates or know the level of income that will prevail in 
  the future (at least for time horizons involved in the climate change debate). 
  Most analysts have resolved this dilemma by using constant discount rates over 
  the entire horizon, despite the fact that they are likely to change. Others 
  have suggested or used non-fixed discount rates that apply strong short-term 
  discounting but entail little further discounting for the very long-term future 
  (e.g., Azar and Sterner, 1996; Heal, 1997). That would cause events a decade 
  or two hence to be significantly discounted but would not cause events a century 
  hence to be reduced in value by powers of 10, as is the occurrence with conventional 
  exponential (compound interest) discounting. Because the largest costs from 
  climate change usually are believed to occur many decades in the future, conventional 
  discounting renders the present value of such future damages very small, whereas 
  non-fixed discount rates (e.g., "hyperbolic discounting") would cause present 
  generations to take serious notice of very large potential damages, even a century 
  hence. Because both the value of the discount rate and the choice of discounting 
  approach involve value judgments about the ethics of intergenerational transfers, 
  it is important for all assessments to be clear about what discounting formulations 
  have been used and the sensitivity of the conclusions to alternative formulations.

<h3><a name="158"></a>1.5.8. "Safe Emission Levels," Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, 
  and the Timing of Emission Abatement </h3>
<p>Several issues raised in this section are discussed primarily in <a href="../wg3/index.htm">the 
  report of Working Group III</a>. However, because this chapter is intended to 
  provide a context for impact, adaptation, and vulnerability issues, this section 
  briefly reviews several emissions abatement complexities that have a bearing 
  on the adaptation/mitigation tradeoff issues (see Section <a href="062.htm#1442">1.4.4.2</a> 
  and <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Because estimates of the monetary costs 
  of impacts span a wide range of values given the many uncertainties and often 
  are value laden, some analysts have argued that climate change targets should 
  be based on physical or social, rather than economic, indicators-for example, 
  past fluctuations in temperature or expected climate-related deaths or some 
  general reference to sustainability or the precautionary principle (see <a href="064.htm#154">Section 
  1.5.4</a>). This precautionary approach is used in European negotiations on 
  emissions of acidifying substances and is acknowledged in Article 3, paragraph 
  3, of the UNFCCC, which states as a principle that "The Parties should take 
  precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate 
  change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious 
  or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used 
  as a reason for postponing such measures...." Such threshold levels (see <a href="061.htm#1435">Section 
  1.4.3.5</a>) also have been used as upper ceilings on the amount of warming 
  considered "tolerable" in the academic sphere (see Alcamo and Kreileman, 1996; 
  Azar and Rodhe, 1997) and the political sphere (for instance, the European Union 
  has adopted a maximum of 2°C temperature change above pre-industrial levels 
  or a maximum of 550 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> concentration target). Implicit in this 
  approach is the assumption of the possibility of very nonlinear damage functions. 
  One drawback with this approach is that necessary tradeoffs between climate 
  damage avoidance and the opportunity costs of resources used to mitigate that 
  climate change often are not made explicit. </p>
<p>Even if the precautionary approach were taken, cost-efficiency analysis would 
  be used to identify the lowest cost of meeting the predefined target. Several 
  studies have made an argument that "where" and "when" flexibility in emissions 
  reductions can greatly reduce its costs (Wigley et al., 1996). Ha-Duong et al. 
  (1997) and Goulder and Schneider (1999) show that preexisting market failures 
  in the energy sector could reduce the costs of immediate climate policies substantially 
  or that neglect of inducing technological changes by delaying incentives associated 
  with immediate climate policies could reverse the conclusions that delayed abatement 
  is more cost-effective. Unfortunately, there is very little literature on how 
  climate policies might induce technological change (see WGIII TAR). Another 
  reason for the controversy in the literature about abatement timing is a misreading 
  of Wigley et al. (1996) that they do not endorse efforts over the next 30 years 
  to make abatement cheaper in the future. Azar (1998) argues, however, that if 
  stabilization targets would be at or below 450 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, early abatement 
  (not just efforts to make future abatement cheaper) would be cost-efficient, 
  even in the Wigley et al. (1996) model. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem of valuing impacts in monetary terms cannot be avoided 
  entirely even under the cost-efficiency approach. Different trajectories toward 
  the stabilization target have different impacts and costs associated with them. 
  How does delaying mitigation affect the impacts, including distributive consequences? 
  The answer to this question is unclear, partly because of large remaining uncertainties 
  about the extent to which rapid forcing of the climate system could trigger 
  threshold events (e.g., Tol, 1995). Moreover, the difference in impacts between 
  early and delayed mitigation responses appears to be sensitive to assumptions 
  about sulfate aerosol cooling and whether small transient temperature differences 
  can have significant effects. </p>
<h3><a name="159"></a>1.5.9. Validation </h3>
<p>Validation of models and assessments that deal with projections over many decades 
  is a serious issue. Often it is not helpful in the context of sustainable development 
  to suggest postponing policy responses until model predictions can be directly 
  compared against reality because that would require experiencing the consequences 
  without amelioration. Instead, models and assessments are subjected to varying 
  levels of quality control, intercomparison with standard assumptions, comparisons 
  with experiments, and extensive peer review. Some authors have argued (e.g., 
  Oreskes et al., 1994) that it is impossible in principle to "validate" models 
  for future events when the processes that determine the model projections contain 
  structural uncertainties (see <a href="055.htm#box11">Boxes 1-1</a>-and <a href="103.htm#box21">2-1</a>). 
  Although the impossibility of direct before-the-fact validation is strictly 
  true, this does not mean that models cannot be rigorously tested. Several stages 
  are involved. First, how well known are the data used to construct model parameters? 
  Second, have the individual processes been tested against lab experiments, field 
  data, or other more comprehensive models? Third, has the overall simulation 
  skill of the model been tested against known events? Fourth, has the model been 
  tested for sensitivity to known shocks (e.g., an oil price hike in an economic 
  model or a paleoclimatic abrupt change in a climate model)? For example, crop 
  yield models are tested against actual yield variation data (<a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>), and sea-level increase models are tested for their ability to reproduce 
  observed changes in the 20th century. The ability of a model to reproduce past 
  conditions is a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, condition for a highly 
  confident forecast of future conditions, unless the underlying processes that 
  gave rise to the phenomena observed in the past will be fully operative in the 
  future and the model captures the influence of such phenomena. Finally, has 
  the comparison between model and data been done at commensurate scales, so that 
  small-scale data are first aggregated to the scale of the lowest resolved element 
  of the model before attempting evaluation (e.g., Root and Schneider, 1995)? 
  When such validation protocols are performed and a model performs "well," subjective 
  confidence that assessment teams can assign to various projections based on 
  such models increases considerably (see <a href="103.htm">Section 2.6</a>), 
  even if "definitive proof" of a specific forecast before the fact is impossible 
  in principle. </p>
<p>All of these considerations demonstrate how the complexities of analysis have 
  led Working Group II TAR authors to emphasize risk management approaches to 
  climate change and policy assessment, rather than just an optimizing framework 
  (e.g., see <a href="112.htm">Section 2.7</a>). These complexities of analysis 
  are not problematic only for the assessment of impacts, vulnerabilities, and 
  adaptability; they also carry forward to questions of tradeoffs between investments 
  in adaptation and mitigation strategies and make a connection between the purviews 
  of Working Groups II and III. </p>
