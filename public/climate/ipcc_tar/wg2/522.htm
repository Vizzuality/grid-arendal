<h4>14.1.2.1.4. Variability and impacts from El Ni&ntilde;o and the Southern Oscillation 
</h4>
<p>The extremes of the Southern Oscillation are partly responsible for large portions 
  of climate variability at interannual scales in Latin America. Therefore, some 
  of the variations in the foregoing elements could be associated with manifestations 
  of climate variability, such as the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, which represents 
  the low phase of the Southern Oscillation; the positive phase is referred to 
  as La Ni&ntilde;a. Atmospheric circulation patterns are more perturbed during 
  El Ni&ntilde;o than during La Ni&ntilde;a years (Salles and Compagnucci, 1995, 
  1997).</p>
<p>In Mexico and parts of the Caribbean, the ENSO signal corresponds to more winter 
  precipitation and less summer precipitation (Maga&ntilde;a and Quintanar, 1997). 
  Some of the most severe droughts in Mexico in recent decades have occurred during 
  ENSO summers (Maga&ntilde;a <i>et al</i>., 1998). The signal of La Ni&ntilde;a 
  is almost opposite to the ENSO signal. In Central America, orographic effects 
  play an important role in understanding regional ENSO effects in precipitation. 
  During El Ni&ntilde;o years, the Pacific side of Central America suffers an 
  important reduction in precipitation, whereas some parts of the Caribbean side 
  experience more rain than usual.</p>
<p>Over Colombia, ENSO events are associated with reductions in precipitation, 
  river streamflows, and soil moisture, whereas La Ni&ntilde;a is associated with 
  heavier precipitation and floods (Poveda and Mesa, 1997). There also is a very 
  high positive correlation between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and river 
  discharge in Colombia. This relationship is stronger during the December-January 
  period and weaker during April-May. The influence of ENSO is stronger at 
  river stations located in western Colombia and weaker for stations located in 
  eastern Colombia. Over the eastern part of the Andes, Ecuador, and northern 
  Peru, large positive anomalies in precipitation typically are observed during 
  the warm episode.</p>
<p>Dry anomalous conditions affect the Amazon region of Brazil northward to the 
  Caribbean through the latter half of the year (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987, 
  1989, 1996; D&iacute;az and Kiladis, 1992). In northern Amazonia and northeast 
  Brazil, deficient rainy seasons have been observed during ENSO years (Aceituno, 
  1988; Marengo, 1992; Uvo, 1998). Droughts that led to forest fires were detected 
  during the very strong ENSO events of 1911-1912, 1925-1926, 1982-1983, 
  and 1997-1998. Extreme droughts also occurred during these years in northeast 
  Brazil. In contrast, the ENSO signal in southern Brazil is opposite to that 
  in northeast Brazil and northern Amazonia, with positive and sometimes extremely 
  large anomalies of rainfall during the rainy season of ENSO years, whereas drought 
  can occur during the positive Southern Oscillation phase (Ropelewski and Halpert, 
  1989; Grimm <i>et al</i>., 1996, 2000). </p>
<p>Through northern and central Chile and at high altitudes of the Andes in Argentina, 
  between 30&deg;S and 40&deg;S, most precipitation is recorded during the winter, 
  with positive anomalies registered during early stages of the warm phase of 
  ENSO. Because of the semi-arid conditions of this area, their economy is strongly 
  affected (Quinn and Neal, 1982; Compagnucci, 1991; Ruttland and Fuenzalida, 
  1991; Canziani <i>et al</i>., 1997; Compagnucci and Vargas, 1998). At the same 
  time, strong rainfall events occur in low altitudes of Chile, triggering debris 
  flows during the winter such as those in Santiago and its surrounding areas 
  in 1991-1993 (Garreaud and Ruttland, 1996) and 1997.</p>
<p>At high altitudes of the Andes, large amounts of snow are recorded consistently. 
  Melting of this accumulated snow is the main cause of river runoff during the 
  summer. In Chile and central-western Argentina, north of 40&deg;S, streamflows 
  were normal or above normal during El Ni&ntilde;o years (Waylen and Caviedes, 
  1990; Compagnucci and Vargas, 1998; Compagnucci, 2000). On the other hand, during 
  cold events (La Ni&ntilde;a), negative anomalies of rainfall and snowfall are 
  present&#151;with opposite consequences, including below-normal summer streamflow. 
  For this region, the likelihood of dry conditions during La Ni&ntilde;a is higher 
  than that of wet conditions during El Ni&ntilde;o (Compagnucci and Vargas, 1998)</p>
