<h2>6.7. Synthesis and Integration</h2>
<p>This chapter is concerned with two closely related but geographically different 
  environments. The oceans&#151;which cover more than 70% of the Earth's 
  surface&#151;are open, expansive, and spatially continuous. By contrast, coastal 
  zones are long, narrow, and discontinuous. As a result, climate change impacts 
  on marine ecosystems may be accommodated more readily in the open ocean (e.g., 
  by migration) than in coastal regions, where mobility is restricted, there are 
  more environmental constraints, and human impacts may be more severe.</p>

<p>The potential biological and physical impacts of climate change and sea-level 
  rise vary considerably between the oceans and coastal regions. The least vulnerable 
  coastal and marine ecosystems have low exposure or high resilience to the impacts. 
  Similarly, coastal communities and marine-based economic sectors that have low 
  exposure or high adaptive capacity will be least affected. Countries, communities, 
  and individuals in the higher range of economic well-being have access to technology, 
  insurance, construction capital, transportation, communication, social support 
  systems, and other assets that enhance their adaptive capacity. Those that do 
  not have access have limited adaptive capacity. Unequal access to adaptation 
  options, therefore unequal vulnerability, are attributable largely to different 
  socioeconomic conditions. Poor adaptation or "maladaptation" also 
  may lead to increased impacts and vulnerability in the future, with implications 
  for intergenerational equity. These concepts are summarized in <a href="#fig6-2">Figure 
  6-2</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas the estimated costs of sea-level rise and other climate-related impacts 
  in developed countries typically are limited to property losses, the reported 
  outcomes of coastal floods in developing countries often include disease and 
  loss of life. Vulnerability assessments in the developing world often do not 
  consider the costs of business interruptions and failures, social disruption 
  and dislocation, health care, evacuation, or relocation. A full accounting of 
  the economic costs associated with lost, diminished, or disrupted lives would 
  require estimates of the economic productivity losses they represent. Because 
  this level of cost accounting is rare in developing countries, inequities may 
  be significantly underestimated.</p>
<p>Turner <i>et al.</i> (1996) note that coastal zones are under increasing stress 
  because of an interrelated set of planning failures, including information, 
  economic market, and policy intervention failures. Moreover, moves toward integrated 
  coastal management are urgently required to guide the co-evolution of natural 
  and human systems. Acknowledging that forecasts of sea-level rise have been 
  scaled down, they note that (1) much uncertainty remains over, for example, 
  combined storm-surge and other events; and (2) within the socioeconomic analyses 
  of the problem, resource valuations have been only partial at best and have 
  failed to incorporate sensitivity analysis in terms of the discount rates utilized. 
  They suggest that these factors would indicate an underestimation of potential 
  damage costs and conclude that a precautionary approach is justified, based 
  on the need to act ahead of adequate information acquisition and use economically 
  efficient resource pricing and proactive coastal planning.</p>
<p>More recently, Turner <i>et al.</i> (1998) have aimed to elicit the main forces 
  influencing the development of coastal areas and the means available to assess 
  present use and manage future exploitation of the coastal zone. Their way of 
  analyzing coastal change and resource management is through the pressure-state-impact-responses 
  (P-S-I-R) conceptual framework. They analyze a variety of pressures and trends 
  (including climate change, population changes, port development, marine aggregate 
  extraction, and pollution). In the P-S-I-R framework, all of these factors are 
  examined in the context of sustainable use of coastal resources and on the basis 
  of an interdisciplinary ecological economics approach. </p>
<p>Several changes that might be expected to accelerate with global warming in 
  the future already are detected in some regions and systems. Examples include 
  global sea-level rise, increases in SST, and regional decreases in sea-ice cover. 
  Impacts associated with these changes have included shoreline erosion, wetland 
  loss, seawater intrusion into freshwater lenses, and some impacts on coral reefs. 
  These impacts provide contemporary analogs for potential impacts in the future, 
  recognizing that future changes and impacts may be of greater magnitude than 
  those experienced so far and that changes and impacts may become more geographically 
  widespread, including expansion into new areas that have not experienced such 
  conditions previously. The contemporary environment gives us some insights into 
  potential ecosystem impacts, some idea of costs, and some experience with potentially 
  useful adaptation strategies.</p>
<p>We have found very few studies that indicate benefits of climate change and 
  sea-level rise in coastal and marine systems. Recent studies, however, point 
  to possible economic benefits from adaptation measures. Such benefits are likely 
  to be restricted, particularly in the areas most at risk&#151;including a large 
  number of developing countries. Furthermore, the extent of impacts in those 
  regions and the range of potentially effective adaptation measures remain poorly 
  defined. Although there is growing acceptance of the need for integrated management 
  strategies, progress has been slow in implementing these concepts in many jurisdictions. 
  Part of the reason is limited development of understanding and tools for integrated 
  assessment and management needs, involving various levels and aspects of integration, 
  each of which may be difficult to implement. For instance, integration between 
  the different disciplines involved in coastal and marine impact and adaptation 
  analysis has been identified as a key issue by Capobianco <i>et al.</i> (1999). 
  This and other integration needs are summarized in <a href="#box6-7">Box 6-7</a>.</p>

        Marine and Coastal Systems</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Integration of marine, terrestrial, and coastal processes and a better 
        understanding of their interactions with human development could lead 
        to substantial improvements in the quality of adaptation strategies. Integration 
        must take place in several areas, including the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Subject/topic-area integration</i></b> (e.g., climate-change 
          related stresses plus non-climate stresses; biophysical and socioeconomic 
          susceptibility, resilience, vulnerability, impacts) 
        <li><b><i>Geographical/spatial integration</i></b> (e.g., linkages between 
          terrestrial, coastal, and oceanic systems and feedbacks; global, regional, 
          local scales) 
        <li><b><i>Methodological integration</i></b> (e.g., integrating physical, 
          social, and economic models) 
        <li><b><i>Integrated implications</i></b> (e.g., for sustainable development, 
          intergenerational equity and ethics) 
        <li><i><b>Integration of science, impacts, and policy.</b></i> 
      </ul>
      <p><b><i>Estuaries as an example of the need for integration</i></b><br>
        Changes in salinity, temperature, sea level, tides, and freshwater inflows 
        to estuaries are considered likely consequences of climate change on estuarine 
        systems. Estuaries are among the world's most-stressed ecosystems 
        because of their close proximity to areas of population growth and development. 
        Understanding of regional differences in the physical drivers that will 
        cause changes in estuarine ecosystems and their ecological functions is 
        limited. Uncertainty also exists regarding changes to dissolved carbon, 
        nutrient delivery and pollutant loading, and their interactions. For example, 
        intensive forestry and agriculture that may be implemented as some regions 
        adapt to climatic change could increase the transport of nutrients such 
        as nitrogen and phosphorus to estuaries. Linkage of hydrological models 
        for surface waters with ocean-atmosphere models is needed to integrate 
        marine and terrestrial ecosystem change. Estuaries illustrate the need 
        for vertical integration among the foregoing subject areas and issues, 
        spatial scales, and methodological approaches, with implications for habitation 
        and use of coastal environments and ecosystems.</p>

<p>Some progress has been made since the SAR in developing and refining methodologies 
  for assessing impacts of sea-level rise. Environments under particular threat 
  include deltas, low coastal plains, coastal barriers, heavily utilized seas, 
  tropical reefs and mangroves, and high-latitude coasts where impacts from warming 
  may occur sooner or more rapidly. </p>
<p>Some topic areas rarely have been addressed, however. For instance, only a 
  few case studies attempt to integrate potential impacts of sea-level rise and 
  increased precipitation and runoff in coastal watersheds in assessing coastal 
  vulnerability. Techniques for similar integration between biophysical and socioeconomic 
  impacts are developing slowly, while human development and population growth 
  in many regions have increased socioeconomic vulnerability and decreased the 
  resilience of coastal ecosystems. Few studies provide details or any quantitative 
  measures. We believe that integrated assessment and management of open marine 
  and coastal ecosystems and a better understanding of their interaction with 
  human development could lead to improvements in the quality of sustainable development 
  strategies.</p>
<p>Global climate change will affect the biogeophysical characteristics of the 
  oceans and coasts, modifying their ecological structure and affecting their 
  ability to sustain coastal residents and communities. Impacts in the coastal 
  zone will reflect local geological, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions 
  within a broader regional or global context. Shorelines are inherently dynamic, 
  responding to short- and long-term variability and trends in sea level, wave 
  energy, sediment supply, and other forcing. Coastal communities&#151;particularly 
  on low-lying deltas, atolls, and reef islands&#151;face threats of inundation, 
  increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion, with impacts on health and safety, 
  water supply, artisanal fisheries, agriculture, aquaculture, property, transportation 
  links, and other infrastructure. In some coastal areas, particularly in developed 
  nations, a shift in emphasis toward managed retreat appears to have gained momentum. 
  Enhancement of biophysical and socioeconomic resilience in coastal regions increasingly 
  is regarded as a cost-effective and desirable adaptive strategy. Growing recognition 
  of the role of the climate-ocean system in the management of fish stocks is 
  leading to new adaptive strategies that are based on determination of accepable 
  removable percentages in relation to climate change and stock resilience.</p>
<p>Vulnerability to climate change and sea-level rise has been documented for 
  a variety of coastal settings via common methodologies developed in the early 
  1990s; these assessments have confirmed the spatial and temporal variability 
  of coastal vulnerability at national and regional levels. New conceptual frameworks 
  include biophysical and socioeconomic impacts and highlight adaptation and resilience 
  as components of vulnerability. Recent advances include models to evaluate economic 
  costs and benefits that incorporate market and nonmarket values. Sustainable 
  approaches to integrated coastal management can now include new financial accounting 
  approaches that include ecological services and traditional cultural values. 
  Nevertheless, adaptive choices will be conditioned by policy criteria and development 
  objectives, requiring researchers and policymakers to work toward a commonly 
  acceptable framework for adaptation.</p>
