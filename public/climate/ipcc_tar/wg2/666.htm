<h3>19.2.3. Conclusions </h3>
<p>Statistically significant associations between trends in regional climate and 
  impacts have been documented in ~100 physical processes and ~450 biological 
  species or communities in terrestrial and polar environments. More than 90% 
  of the changes (~99% physical, ~80% biophysical) documented worldwide are consistent 
  with how physical and biological processes are known to respond to climate. 
  There are systematic trends of ecological change across major taxonomic groups 
  (amphibians, birds, insects, mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates) inhabiting 
  diverse climatic zones and habitats. The overall processes and patterns of observations 
  reveal a widespread and coherent impact of 20th-century climate changes on many 
  physical and biological systems (see <a href="664.htm#fig192">Figure 19-2</a>).</p>
<p>Expected directions of change relating to regional climate warming for physical 
  systems have been reported in studies documenting shrinkage of glaciers, decreases 
  in snow cover, shortening of duration of lake- and river-ice cover, declines 
  in sea-ice extent and thickness, lengthening of frost-free seasons, and intensification 
  of the hydrological cycle. Expected directions of change relating to regional 
  climate warming for biological systems have been reported in studies documenting 
  poleward and elevational shifts in distribution and earlier phenology (i.e., 
  earlier breeding, emergence, flowering) in plant and animal species. </p>
<p>In general, geographic patterns of responses also conform to expectations relating 
  to regional climate change, as opposed to alternative explanations. Reported 
  cases of observed impacts are concentrated in high-latitude and high-altitude 
  physical and biological systems and tend to be in regions where observed regional 
  warming has been greatest and confounding factors often are at least partially 
  minimized. Although land-use change, pollution, and biotic invasions are widespread 
  anthropogenic influences, they are unlikely to cause the spatial patterns (e.g., 
  skewed poleward and elevational range shifts) and temporal patterns (e.g., earlier 
  breeding and flowering) that are documented over the set of reported studies. 
</p>
<p>The sample of studies shown in <a href="664.htm#fig192">Figure 19-2</a> was 
  drawn from a literature survey with keywords relating to climate trends and 
  observed trends in impacts. The time period of most of the studies includes 
  the recent warm period beginning in the late 1970s. The geographical distribution 
  of studies to date is biased toward Europe and North America but does include 
  evidence of observed impacts of regional climate change relating to physical 
  processes from all continents. The spottiness of biological evidence in other 
  regions may indicate that observed impacts of regional climate change are not 
  occurring, have not yet been detected, or are being masked by other changes, 
  such as urbanization. Many studies include multiple species and report on the 
  number of species that responded to regional climate changes as expected, not 
  as expected, or exhibited no change. Most of the biophysical studies included 
  in <a href="664.htm#fig192">Figure 19-2</a> report on statistical tests of trends 
  in climate variable, trends in observed impacts, and relationships between the 
  two (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). </p>
<p>In <a href="664.htm#fig192">Figure 19-2</a>, ~16 studies examining glaciers, 
  sea ice, snow-cover extent/snowmelt, or ice on lakes or streams at more than 
  150 sites were selected. Of these ~150 sites, 67% (~100) show change in one 
  or more variable(s) over time. Of these ~100 sites, about 99% exhibit trends 
  in a direction that is expected, given scientific understanding of known mechanisms 
  that relate temperatures to physical processes that affect change in that variable. 
  The probability that this proportion of sites would show directional changes 
  by chance is much less than 0.00001.</p>
<p>There are preliminary indications that some social and economic systems have 
  been affected in part by 20th-century regional climate changes (e.g., increased 
  damages from flooding and droughts in some locations). It generally is difficult 
  to separate climate change effects from coincident or alternative explanations 
  for such observed regional impacts. Evidence from studies relating regional 
  climate change impacts on socioeconomic systems has been reviewed but is not 
  included in the summary figure because of the complexities inherent in those 
  systems. </p>
<p>The effects of regional climate change observed to date provide information 
  about the potential vulnerability of physical, biological, and socioeconomic 
  systems to climate change in terms of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. 
  Some of the observed effects are adaptations. In some cases, observed impacts 
  are large relative to the levels of regional climate changes (e.g., large changes 
  in ecosystem dynamics with small changes in regional climate). In general, observations 
  of impacts agree with predictions that estimate more serious impacts at higher 
  GHG concentrations because the greater regional climate changes are associated 
  with stronger impacts. </p>
<p>Relating the observed impacts summarized here to the reasons for concern analyzed 
  in this chapter, we find the following:</p>
<p><ol><li> There is preliminary evidence that unique and threatened systems are beginning 
  to be affected by regional climate change (e.g., glaciers, polar environments, 
  rare species). <br>
  <li> With regard to the distributional effects of observed impacts relating to 
  regional climate changes, most evidence to date comes from high-latitude and 
  high-altitude environments, where regional warming has been and is expected 
  to be more pronounced. <br>
  <li> Aggregate impacts of regional climate changes at the global level are difficult 
  to define, except in sectors in which there is a common metric, as in market 
  sectors. The many simultaneous factors and varying adaptive capacities make 
  extracting aggregate effects attributable to observed climate change difficult. 
  What can be stated in summary regarding the diverse set of impacts reported 
  to date is that there are cases of observed impacts in many diverse environments; 
  that they occur in a wide array of processes, species, and ecosystems; and that 
  the overall patterns and processes reveal a coherent impact of 20th-century 
  climate changes on many physical and biological systems.<br>
  <li> Impacts of extreme events have been implicated in many of the observations 
  summarized in this section, including increases in extreme precipitation events 
  in some locations. <br>
  <li> There is no current evidence in observed impacts that large-scale abrupt 
    changes already are occurring. Yet, paleoclimate evidence (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
    WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/048.htm">Chapter 2</a>) shows that such changes have occurred 
    in physical and biological systems in the past and therefore may occur with 
    a continuation of the current warming trend.
