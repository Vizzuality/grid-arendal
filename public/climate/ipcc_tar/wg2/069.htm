<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to address several overarching methodological 
  issues that transcend individual sectoral and regional concerns. In so doing, 
  this chapter focuses on five related questions: How can current effects of climate 
  change be detected? How can future effects of climate change be anticipated, 
  estimated, and integrated? How can impacts and adaptations be valued and costed? 
  How can uncertainties be expressed and characterized? What frameworks are available 
  for decisionmaking? In addressing these questions, each section of <a href="068.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> seeks to identify methodological developments since the Second Assessment 
  Report (SAR) and to identify gaps and needs for further development of methods 
  and tools.</p>
<p><i>Detection of Response to Climate Change by Using Indicator Species or Systems</i><b><br>
  </b>Assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems that already have 
  occurred as a result of recent climate change is an important complement to 
  model projections of future impacts. Such detection is impeded by multiple, 
  often inter-correlated, nonclimatic forces that are concurrently affecting those 
  systems. Attempts to overcome this problem have involved the use of indicator 
  species to detect responses to climate change and to infer more general impacts 
  of climate change on natural systems. An important component of the detection 
  process is the search for systematic patterns of change across many studies 
  that are consistent with expectations, based on observed or predicted changes 
  in climate. Confidence in attribution of these observed changes to climate change 
  increases as studies are replicated across diverse systems and geographic regions.</p>
<p>Since the SAR, approaches to analysing and synthesizing existing data sets 
  from abiotic and biotic systems have been developed and applied to detection 
  of present impacts of 20th-century climate change. Even though studies now number 
  in the hundreds, some regions and systems are underrepresented. However, there 
  is a substantial amount of existing data that could fill these gaps. Organized 
  efforts are needed to identify, analyze, and synthesize those data sets. </p>
<p><i>Anticipating the Effects of Climate Change</i><b><br>
  </b>A wide range of methods and tools are now used and available for studies 
  of local, regional, and global impacts. Since the SAR, improvements have included 
  greater emphasis on the use of process-oriented models and transient climate 
  change scenarios, refined socioeconomic baselines, and higher resolution assessments. 
  Country studies and regional assessments in every continent have tested models 
  and tools in a variety of contexts. First-order impact models have been linked 
  to global systems models. Adaptation has been included in many assessments, 
  often for the first time. </p>
<p>Methodological gaps remain concerning scales, data, validation, and integration. 
  Procedures for assessing regional and local vulnerability and long-term adaptation 
  strategies require high-resolution assessments, methodologies to link scales, 
  and dynamic modeling that uses corresponding and new data sets. Validation at 
  different scales often is lacking. Regional integration across sectors is required 
  to place vulnerability in the context of local and regional development. Methods 
  and tools to assess vulnerability to extreme events have improved but are constrained 
  by low confidence in climate change scenarios and the sensitivity of impact 
  models to major climatic anomalies. Understanding and integrating higher order 
  economic effects and other human dimensions of global change are required. Adaptation 
  models and vulnerability indices to prioritize adaptation options are at early 
  stages of development in many fields. Methods to enable stakeholder participation 
  in assessments need improvement.</p>
<p><i>Integrated Assessment</i><b><br>
  </b>Integrated assessment is an interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets, 
  and communicates knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines in an effort 
  to investigate and understand causal relationships within and between complicated 
  systems. Methodological approaches employed in such assessments include computer-aided 
  modeling, scenario analyses, simulation gaming and participatory integrated 
  assessment, and qualitative assessments that are based on existing experience 
  and expertise. </p>
<p>Since the SAR, significant progress has been made in developing and applying 
  these approaches to integrated assessment, globally and regionally. However, 
  the emphasis in such integrated assessments, particularly in integrated modeling, 
  has been on mitigation; few existing studies have focused on adaptation and/or 
  determinants of adaptive capacity. Methods designed to include adaptation and 
  adaptive capacity explicitly in specific applications need to be developed. 
</p>
<p><i>Costing and Valuation</i><b><br>
  </b>Methods of economic costing and valuation rely on the notion of opportunity 
  cost of resources used, degraded, or saved. Opportunity cost depends on whether 
  the market is competitive or monopolistic and whether any externalities are 
  present. It also depends on the rate at which future costs are discounted, which 
  can vary across countries, over time, and over generations. The impact of uncertainty 
  also can be valued if the probabilities of different possible outcomes are known. 
  Public and nonmarket goods and services can be valued through willingness to 
  pay for them or willingness to accept compensation for lack of them. Impacts 
  on different groups, societies, nations, and species need to be assessed. Comparison 
  of alternative distributions of welfare across individuals and groups within 
  a country can be justified if they are made according to internally consistent 
  norms. Comparisons across nations with different societal, ethical, and governmental 
  structures cannot yet be made meaningfully. </p>
<p>No new fundamental developments in costing and valuation methodology have taken 
  place since the SAR. Many new applications of existing methods to a widening 
  range of climate change issues, however, have demonstrated the strengths and 
  limitations of some of these methods. For example, many contingent valuation 
  studies have raised questions about the reliability of such evaluations. Similarly, 
  more attention is now paid to the limitations of methods that underlie efforts 
  to reduce all impacts to one monetary value and/or to compare welfare across 
  countries and cultures. Multi-objective assessments are preferred, but means 
  by which their underlying metrics might more accurately reflect diverse social, 
  political, economic, and cultural contexts need to be developed. In addition, 
  methods for integrating across these multiple metrics are still missing from 
  the methodological repertoire.</p>
<p><i>Treatment of Uncertainties</i><b><br>
  </b>The Earth's linked climate and social-natural systems are very complex; 
  thus, there are many unresolved uncertainties in nearly all aspects of the assessment 
  of climatic impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation. Subjective judgments are 
  inevitable in most estimates of such complex systems. Since the SAR, more consistent 
  treatment of uncertainties and assessment of biases in judgments have been attempted. 
  Progress also has been made in developing methods for expressing confidence 
  levels for estimates, outcomes, and conclusions, based on more consistent quantitative 
  scales or consistently defined sets of terms to describe the state of the science. 
  Notable attempts to provide "traceable accounts" of how disaggregated 
  information has been incorporated into aggregated estimates have been made, 
  but more work is needed. Greater attention to eliminating inconsistent use of 
  confidence terms or including a full range of uncertainty for key results is 
  still needed in future assessments. Whereas significant progress on issues of 
  uncertainty has been achieved in the context of impacts and vulnerability, a 
  major challenge now lies in addressing uncertainties associated with adaptability.</p>
<p><i>Decision Analytic Frameworks</i><b><br>
  </b>Policymakers who are responsible for devising and implementing adaptive 
  policies should be able to rely on results from one or more of a diverse set 
  of decision analytical frameworks. Commonly used methods include cost-benefit 
  and -effectiveness analyses, various types of decision analysis (including multi-objective 
  studies), and participatory techniques such as policy exercises, but there are 
  many other possible approaches. Among the large number of assessments of climate 
  change impacts reviewed in this volume, only a small fraction include comprehensive 
  and quantitative estimates of adaptation options and their costs, benefits, 
  and uncertainty characteristics. This information is necessary for meaningful 
  applications of any decision analytical method. Very few cases in which decision 
  analytic frameworks have been used in evaluating adaptation options have been 
  reported. Greater use of methods in support of adaptation decisions is needed 
  to establish their efficacy and identify directions for necessary research in 
  the context of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.</p>
