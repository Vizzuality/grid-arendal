<h3>9.5.2. Storms and Tropical Cyclones<br>
</h3>
<p>Impoverished and high-density populations in low-lying and environmentally 
  degraded areas are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones (also called 
  hurricanes and typhoons). Many of the most serious impacts of tropical cyclones 
  in the 20th century have occurred in Bangladesh because of the combination of 
  meteorological and topographical conditions, along with the inherent vulnerability 
  of this low-income, poorly resourced population. Tropical cyclones also can 
  cause landslides and flooding. Most deaths are caused by drowning in the storm 
  surge (Alexander, 1993; Noji, 1997). The impacts of cyclones in Japan and other 
  developed countries have been decreasing in recent years because of improved 
  early warning systems. However, the experience of Hurricane Mitch demonstrated 
  the destructive power of an extreme event on a densely populated and poorly 
  resourced region (PAHO, 1999).</p>
<h3><a name="953"></a>9.5.3. Droughts</h3>
<p>The health impacts of drought on populations occur primarily via impacts on 
  food production. Famine often occurs when a preexisting situation of malnutrition 
  worsens. The health consequences of drought include diseases resulting from 
  malnutrition (McMichael <i>et al</i>., 1996b). In times of shortage, water is 
  used for cooking rather than hygiene. In particular, this increases the risk 
  of diarrheal diseases (as a result of fecal contamination) and water-washed 
  diseases (e.g., trachoma, scabies). Outbreaks of malaria can occur during droughts 
  as a result of changes in vector breeding sites (Bouma and van der Kaay, 1996). 
  Malnutrition also increases susceptibility to infection. </p>
<p>In addition to adverse environmental conditions, political, environmental, 
  or economic crises can trigger a collapse in food marketing systems. These factors 
  may have a cumulative or synergistic effect. For example, a breakdown in the 
  reserve food supply system resulting from the sale of grain or livestock reserves 
  might be exacerbated by conflict and breakdown in law and order. The major food 
  emergency in Sudan during 1998 illustrates the interrelationship between climatic 
  triggers of famine and conflict. Land mines made portions of major roads in 
  southern Sudan impassable and contributed to poor access for relief supplies. 
  By July 1998, the World Food Programme's air cargo capacity had increased to 
  more than 10,000 t to overcome the transport difficulties. These air cargoes 
  were supplemented by barge convoys and road repair projects (WFP, 1999). Vulnerability 
  to drought and food shortages can be greatly reduced through the use of seasonal 
  forecasts as part of an early warning system (see <a href="370.htm#9111">Section 
  9.11.1</a>).<br>

        <p><b>Box 9-1. Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Exposure to Ultraviolet 
          Radiation</b></p>
        <p align="left">Stratospheric ozone destruction is an essentially separate 
          process from greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation in the lower atmosphere. 
          However, not only are several of the anthropogenic GHGs [e.g., chlorofluorocarbons 
          (CFCs) and N<sub>2</sub>O] also ozone-depleting gases but tropospheric 
          warming apparently induces stratospheric cooling, which exacerbates 
          ozone destruction (Shindell <i>et al</i>., 1998; Kirk-Davidoff <i>et 
          al</i>., 1999). Stratospheric ozone shields the Earth's surface 
          from incoming solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which has harmful effects 
          on human health. Long-term decreases in summertime ozone over New Zealand 
          have been associated with significant increases in ground-level UVR, 
          particularly in the DNA-damaging waveband (McKenzie <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
          In a warmer world, patterns of personal exposure to solar radiation 
          (e.g., sunbathing in temperate climates) also are likely to change.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Many epidemiological studies have implicated solar radiation 
          as a cause of skin cancer (melanoma and other types) in fair-skinned 
          humans (IARC, 1992; WHO, 1994). The most recent assessment by UNEP (1998) 
          projects significant increases in skin cancer incidence as a result 
          of stratospheric ozone depletion. High-intensity UVR also damages the 
          eye's outer tissue, causing "snowblindness"&#151;the 
          ocular equivalent of sunburn. Chronic exposure to UVR is linked to conditions 
          such as pterygium (WHO, 1994). The role of UV-B in cataract formation 
          is complex. Some cataract subtypes appear to be associated with UVR 
          exposure, whereas others do not. In humans and experimental animals, 
          UVR can cause local and whole-body immunosuppression (UNEP, 1998). Cellular 
          immunity has been shown to be affected by ambient doses of UVR (Garssen 
          <i>et al</i>., 1998). Concern exists that UVR-induced immunosuppression 
          could influence patterns of infectious disease. Nevertheless, no direct 
          evidence exists for such effects in humans, and uncertainties remain 
          about the underlying biological processes.</p>
