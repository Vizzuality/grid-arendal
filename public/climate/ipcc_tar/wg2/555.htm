<h4><a name="15211"></a>15.2.1.1. Impacts and Adaptation Options</h4>
<p>The impacts of hydrological changes and options for effective adaptation will 
  depend on the nature of the hydrological changes, the amount of buffering provided 
  by natural and artificial storage capacity, the nature of demands on the resource, 
  and the effectiveness with which institutions in place balance competing demands. 
  Continued increases in demand are likely for the multiple services provided 
  by North American water resources, encompassing out-of-stream and instream uses. 
  Adaptations to the effects of climate change therefore will occur in conjunction 
  with adjustments to changes in the level and characteristics of water demands.</p>
<p>A major comparative study of six U.S. water resource systems found that although 
  climate change could have significant and often adverse impacts on system performance, 
  adjustments to reservoir operations could be made, allowing those impacts to 
  be smaller than the underlying hydrological changes (Lettenmaier <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  The authors also found that "The effects of anticipated demand growth and 
  other plausible future operational considerations&#133;would about equal or 
  exceed the effects of climate change over system planning horizons" (Lettenmaier, 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). <br>
</p>
<p>The importance of future changes in demand is echoed by Frederick and Schwarz 
  (1999). They found that even in the absence of climate change, the annual cost 
  of supplying water to meet projected increases in U.S. water demands would be 
  about US$13.8 billion higher in 2030 than in 1995, based on the current trend 
  of increasingly using conservation to balance growing demands with supplies. 
  This trend has been driven by "&#133;the high costs of developing new supplies, 
  environmental concerns, a growing appreciation for the values of instream flows 
  and efforts to improve water quality" (Frederick and Schwarz, 1999). Using 
  projected runoff changes calculated by Wolock and McCabe (2000) for 18 water 
  resource regions, the study found that runoff increases projected by the HadCM2 
  model tended to reduce the cost of balancing future water supplies and demands, 
  whereas the reduced flows projected by the CCC model resulted in large cost 
  increases. With the CCC model projections, the study found that under an "efficient 
  management" scenario, annual water costs could increase "&#133;by 
  nearly US$105 billion, about US$308 per person. Much higher cost increases would 
  result from policies to maintain relatively high streamflow levels under such 
  dry conditions" (Frederick and Schwarz, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>This finding&#151;that institutions can have significant impacts on the costs 
  arising from reduced water availability&#151;is supported by a study that assessed 
  the possible consequences of a severe sustained drought on the Colorado River 
  system (Lord <i>et al</i>., 1995). The study authors found that the "Law of the 
  River," as currently interpreted and implemented, would leave sensitive 
  biological resources, hydropower generation, recreational values, and Upper 
  Colorado basin water users vulnerable to damages despite extraordinary engineering 
  attempts to drought-proof the river. The study also found that certain proposed 
  institutional and system operating changes could considerably alter the level 
  and incidence of the damages (Booker, 1995; Kenney, 1995; Lord <i>et al</i>., 1995; 
  Sangoyomi and Harding, 1995). For example, reallocation from low- to high-valued 
  uses (e.g., through intrastate or interstate water marketing) and changes in 
  reservoir storage policies to hold water in the Upper Colorado basin to reduce 
  evaporative losses could reduce consumptive use damages by more than 90% (Booker, 
  1995).<br>
</p>
<p>Such "what if" analyses can foster creative thinking about adaptation 
  options. Future adaptation strategies also are likely to build on current creative 
  solutions to meeting water supply challenges. For example, when increases in 
  agricultural and sewerage runoff in the Catskill/Delaware watershed region threatened 
  the quality of New York City's water supplies, the city was faced with 
  a choice of either building an artificial filtration plant or taking action 
  to protect and restore the natural purification capacity of the watershed's 
  ecosystem. The capital cost of the filtration plant would have been US$6-8 
  billion, plus annual operating costs of US$300 million. The city found that 
  for a fraction of that cost it could enter into agreements with landowners in 
  the watershed to adopt land-use practices that would adequately protect water 
  quality, making the filtration plant unnecessary (PCAST, 1998; Platt <i>et al</i>., 
  2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Adjustments to the effects of climate change as well as to evolving demands 
  for out-of-stream and instream water uses may entail impacts on the distribution 
  of water-use benefits. The question of who will bear the costs of any reduction 
  in water availability depends on the nature and ownership of existing water 
  rights, how those rights are measured, and how they may be modified by other 
  policies. In the United States, federal legislation&#151;including the Endangered 
  Species Act and the Clean Water Act&#151;has regulated or constrained development 
  of many new water projects and could be applied to modify existing water diversions 
  (WWPRAC, 1998). Native American (aboriginal) communities often possess reserved 
  water rights that, despite their high priority, have never been developed or 
  clearly quantified. Substantial litigation and negotiation efforts have focused 
  on clarifying these rights. Any significant change in water availability may 
  heighten tensions between these communities and neighboring water users (Echohawk 
  and Chambers, 1991). Under riparian water law and permit systems, governmental 
  authorities may have substantial discretion in regulating water uses under drought 
  conditions (Abrams, 1990; Flood, 1990; Sherk, 1990; Dellapenna, 1991; Scott 
  and Coustalin, 1995). Under the prior appropriation system of water law, which 
  is followed in western Canada and most states in the western portion of the 
  United States, the risk of a shortfall generally is inversely proportional to 
  the seniority of the right. Many junior rightholders, however, have access to 
  water stored in reservoirs, which improves their security of supply. <br>
</p>
<p>Several studies have argued that improving the functioning of water markets 
  could help to create the kind of flexibility needed to respond to uncertain 
  changes in future water availability (e.g., Trelease, 1977; Tarlock, 1991; OTA, 
  1993; Miller <i>et al</i>., 1997). If water supplies decline in particular locations 
  or seasons, water markets could soften the impacts by moving water from lower 
  to higher valued uses. In the western United States, where irrigation now accounts 
  for more than 80% of consumptive water use, water market activity is likely 
  to continue the current trend of movement of water out of irrigated agriculture 
  to accommodate other water uses (WWPRAC, 1998). However, water markets are not 
  likely to adequately protect instream flows and sensitive biological resources 
  unless public agencies are given budgets to buy or rent water to protect those 
  values (Wilkinson, 1989; NRC, 1992). In addition, water rights have to be clearly 
  defined for water markets to function properly. Even in the western United States, 
  where water markets have developed rapidly in recent years (Saliba and Bush, 
  1987; NRC, 1992; Colby, 1996; Yoskowitz, 1999), market development has been 
  hampered by the fact that water rights often are not well documented (e.g., 
  Costello and Kole, 1985; Gould, 1988; Colby, 1998). To avoid adverse impacts 
  on other water users, water authorities typically review each transfer proposal. 
  The entire process often entails substantial transaction costs, and these costs 
  differ significantly across jurisdictions (Saliba and Bush, 1987; MacDonnell, 
  1990; NRC, 1992). This suggests that administrative practices and other institutional 
  factors affect the efficiency of the water transfer process and that administrative 
  reforms to reduce transaction costs could improve adaptability to the effects 
  of climate change.</p>
<p>Finally, permanent water transfers are not particularly effective in promoting 
  flexible adaptation to climatic variability or uncertain climate changes. Small, 
  temporary transfers through water banks such as California's Emergency Drought 
  Water Banks would provide greater flexibility (see <a href="584.htm">Section 
  15.3.2.3</a>).</p>
<p>Although well-functioning water markets may ameliorate the socioeconomic impacts 
  of reduced water availability, they cannot completely eliminate the adverse 
  impacts of a drying scenario. Using models that assume optimal allocation of 
  water across all sectors (which implicitly assumes perfect, cost-free water 
  markets), Hurd <i>et al</i>. (1998) estimated the water resources-related costs 
  of climate change scenarios for four major river basins in the United States. 
  They found that losses from moderate and severe drying scenarios tended to be 
  greater in the semi-arid western United States than in the eastern states. From 
  this analysis, they project that national water-related welfare losses arising 
  from a temperature increase of 2.5&deg;C coupled with a 7% increase in precipitation 
  would be on the order of US$9.5 billion. A scenario with a temperature increase 
  of 5&deg;C coupled with no change in precipitation would result in losses of 
  US$43 billion. Overall, they found that the economic costs probably would be 
  dominated by impacts on water quality and instream nonconsumptive water uses, 
  especially hydroelectricity generation. This result hinges on their assumption 
  that irrigators&#151;who currently dominate ownership of water in the western 
  United States&#151;would benefit by selling some of their water to other sectors. 
  More realistic assumptions regarding the costs of transferring water through 
  water markets would have produced larger estimated losses and a different distribution 
  of losses across sectors.</p>
<p>Water rights are not always defined in terms that would permit the transfer 
  of a specific amount of water from one use to another, particularly in eastern 
  U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions that still follow a traditional riparian system 
  of water law (Tarlock, 1989; Flood, 1990; Scott and Coustalin, 1995). In such 
  areas, accommodation of competing demands and changing supplies will require 
  local and regional planning and coordination. For example, if the levels and 
  outflows of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system decline, as most available 
  scenarios suggest, adaptation options are likely to raise sensitive interjurisdictional 
  allocation issues and may require infrastructure investments that will increase 
  the need for cooperative planning and management of the basin's water resources 
  (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
