<h2>5.6. Forests and Woodlands</h2>
<p>Forests and woodlands<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> provide many goods and services that society values, 
  including food, marketable timber and non-wood products (fuel, fiber, construction 
  material), medicines, biodiversity, regulation of biogeochemical cycles, soil 
  and water conservation (e.g., erosion prevention), carbon reservoirs, recreation, 
  research opportunities, and spiritual and cultural values. Forests play a key 
  role in the functioning of the biosphere&#151;for example, through carbon and 
  water cycles (the latter is discussed in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>)&#151;and 
  hence indirectly affect the provision of many other goods and services (Woodwell 
  and MacKenzie, 1995). Changes in global climate and atmospheric composition 
  are likely to have an impact on most of these goods and services, with significant 
  impacts on socioeconomic systems (Winnett, 1998).</p>
<p>Since the SAR, many studies have dealt with changes in the structure, composition, 
  and spatial patterns of forests (e.g., VEMAP Members, 1995; Smith et al., 1996a; 
  Bugmann, 1997; Shriner et al., 1998). The biogeochemical literature has focused 
  on the carbon cycle (e.g., Apps and Price, 1996; Fan et al., 1998; Steffen et 
  al., 1998; Tian et al., 1998; IPCC, 2000; Schimel et al., 2000). There is an 
  expectation that directed land-management practices can either increase or retain 
  carbon stocks in forests, thereby helping to mitigate increases in atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels; this is discussed elsewhere (IPCC, 2000; see also <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR 
  WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/155.htm">Chapter 4</a> and <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> 
  <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapter 3</a>). </p>
<p>The influence of climate change on forests and associated goods and services 
  is difficult to separate from the influence of other global change pressures 
  such as atmospheric changes, land use, and land-use change resulting from human 
  activities. The State-Pressure-Impacts approach outlined in <a href="201.htm">Section 
  5.1</a> is used here as a framework to examine interrelated responses to global 
  change and expected changes in supply of services from forests and woodlands 
  (see <a href="202.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>). In this section, the focus is on 
  some of the important pressures, impacts, and responses for three goods and 
  services provided by forests and woodland ecosystems: carbon, timber, and non-wood 
  goods and services. The impact on biodiversity in forests is covered in <a href="202.htm">Sections 
  5.2</a> and <a href="218.htm">5.4</a>. The state of the sector and the pressures 
  acting on it, as well as possible responses, impacts, and adaptation opportunities, 
  will differ among the regions of the world; here the focus is on global commonality.</p>
<h3><a name="561"></a>5.6.1. Current Status and Trends</h3>
<p>This section presents an overview of the current status and trends for forests 
  in general; specific regional trends are presented in some of the regional chapters 
  (<a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). </p>
<p>The world's forests cover approximately 3,500 Mha (FAO, 1997a), or about 
  30% of the total land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica). About 57% of 
  the world's forests, mostly tropical, are located in developing countries. 
  About 60% are located in seven countries (in order): the Russian Federation, 
  Brazil, Canada, the United States, China, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic 
  of Congo. </p>
<p>In 1995, plantation forests were estimated to cover 81 Mha (2.3% of total estimated 
  cover) in developing countries and about 80-100 Mha in developed countries 
  (FAO, 1997a). They play an important role, particularly in the production of 
  industrial roundwood and fuelwood, restoration of degraded lands, and provision 
  of non-wood products (FAO, 1997a). Some countries obtain 50-95% of their 
  industrial roundwood production from plantations that cover 1-17% of their 
  total forest area (Sedjo, 1999). In many developing countries, plantations often 
  occur as community woodlots, farm forests, and agroforestry operations. </p>
<p>Between 1980 and 1995, the area of the world's forests decreased by about 180 
  Mha (5% loss of total forest area in 15 years) as a result of human activities 
  (FAO, 1997a). About 200 Mha were converted to agriculture (subsistence agriculture, 
  cash crops, and ranching), but this loss was partially offset by about 40 Mha 
  increase in plantations. In developed countries, forests increased over the 
  same period by about 20 Mha through afforestation and natural regeneration on 
  land no longer in use by agriculture, despite losses of forests to urbanization 
  and infrastructure development. Loss of native forest in developing countries 
  (tropical and nontropical) appears to have slowed during 1990-1995, with an 
  overall loss of about 65 Mha (FAO, 1997a). However, other changes such as fragmentation, 
  nonsustainable logging of mature forests, degradation, and development of infrastructure&#151;all 
  leading to losses of biomass&#151;have occurred over large areas. Of about 92 
  Mha of tropical closed forest that underwent a change in cover class during 
  1980-1990, 10% became fragmented forest and 20% was converted to open forest 
  or extended forest fallow (FAO, 1996). There are no global estimates of forest 
  degradation, but data from specific areas give an indication of the extent of 
  degradation. Logging practices damage and degrade more than 1 Mha yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  of forest in the Brazilian Amazon; surface fires (e.g., those in 1998) may burn 
  large areas of standing forest in these regions (Cochrane et al., 1999; Nepstad 
  et al., 1999; see also <a href="516.htm">Chapter 14</a>). These authors conclude 
  that present estimates of annual deforestation for Brazilian Amazonia capture 
  less than half of the forest area that is impoverished each year&#151;and even 
  less during years of severe drought. In the boreal zone, there has been continuing 
  encroachment by agriculture and development of infrastructure (roads, survey 
  lines, wellheads, etc.) that open access to primary forests. Preliminary estimates 
  of these effects for Canada, for example, indicate a net loss of 54,000-81,000 
  ha yr<sup>-1</sup> of forest over the period 1990-1998 as a result of various 
  activities (Robinson et al., 1999).</p>
