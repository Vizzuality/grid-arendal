<h3>10.3. Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability </h3>
<p>The foregoing assessment highlights the high vulnerability of Africa to climate 
  change as a result of limited adaptive capacity constrained by numerous factors 
  at the national level. The floods of February 2000 in southern Africa (which 
  affected Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe) highlight huge differences 
  in adaptive capacities between countries. Adaptive capacity was influenced largely 
  by the ability to communicate potential risks to vulnerable communities and 
  the ability to react as a result of perceived risks. The ability to mobilize 
  emergency evacuation was critical in reducing adverse impacts. Although there 
  may be high adaptive capacity locally or nationally, overall most countries 
  in Africa have low capacity to adapt to abrupt and extreme events.</p>
<p>Scarce water resources are becoming increasingly critical for Africa; they 
  determine food security as well as human and ecosystem health, and play a major 
  role in political and socioeconomic development. Although parts of Africa have 
  abundant water, shifting water to stressed areas is not an option in many cases. 
  Groundwater resources are likely to be impacted by prolonged droughts and changes 
  in land cover and land use, in a complex interaction of human activity and population 
  growth rates, climate, and environmental responses. Adaptation will require 
  small actions as well as major national approaches. At the management unit level 
  (e.g., watershed), careful management of rainwater through damming will allow 
  agricultural production. There is vast experience in arid regions of Africa 
  such as Namibia, Botswana, and north Africa (such as Morocco), where brief periods 
  of rain are utilized very efficiently for farming. The constraint will be in 
  finding limits to water extraction that do not adversely impact communities 
  downstream and result in conflicts. Regional bodies set up to negotiate international 
  water rights will play an increasingly crucial role. At the national level, 
  political goals such as self-sufficiency in food production will need to be 
  reevaluated with reference to water resources available to the country and how 
  they can be apportioned between food production, human needs, and ecosystem 
  needs. Countries will need to be more open to fulfilling their food needs through 
  imports and redistribution, using intensified production in areas where it is 
  possible. Good communications within and between countries and major ports are 
  critical to food security. These include roads, rail, and air transportation 
  networks. For inland countries, large corridors being opened up or upgraded 
  (such as the Maputo, Nacala, and Beira corridors between Mozambique and South 
  Africa, Malawi, and Zimbabwe) will greatly enhance access to food and other 
  imported goods. This places greater importance on international relations.</p>
<p>At the subregional scale, Africa is vulnerable to ENSO and related extreme 
  events (drought, floods, changed patterns). As shown by Semazzi and Song (2000), 
  deforestation is likely to alter circulations in distant places through teleconnected 
  feedbacks, increasing the vulnerability of distant populations. Advances in 
  seasonal forecasting, using climate models and satellite observations, has been 
  shown to be a first-order response strategy to changing climate variability. 
  Similar applications of satellite observations (such as for SST) also are useful 
  in predicting disease outbreaks such as RVF. Effective communication of predicted 
  extreme weather events and evaluation of potential risks is critical in minimizing 
  human loss of life, where it is possible to react. Disaster management plans 
  are required and need to be developed jointly with all members of a community.</p>
<p>There is great potential in investing in seasonal forecasting and development 
  of tools (models) such as crop models that can be used to make adjustments in 
  management. Although these models are still experimental, they offer a realistic 
  response to changing climatic patterns. Data must be collected to calibrate 
  and validate these models. In the longer term, governments will need to develop 
  strategic plans that are based on solid foundations. This is an area that is 
  underdeveloped in almost all of Africa.</p>
<p>External funding drives programs in many African countries, so agendas usually 
  align closely with donor agency interests. This situation presents a dilemma 
  for Africa. There is capacity in many countries now to evaluate effective strategies 
  to adapt to adverse effects of climate change. However, these countries are 
  at the mercy of donor agency representatives who often are less informed about 
  issues of climate change. These representatives often regard immediate problems 
  of poverty, erosion, health, and empowerment as the only priority issues for 
  Africa. Longer term planning&#151;for example, land-use planning in areas that 
  are susceptible to flooding under infrequent cyclonic events&#151;never receives 
  the attention it deserves. Most African countries are unlikely to motivate internal 
  funding for climate change; therefore, it is critical that funding agencies 
  award high visibility to issues of climate change.</p>
