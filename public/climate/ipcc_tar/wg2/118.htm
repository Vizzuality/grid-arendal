<h3>2.7.4. Relevance and Use of DAFs in Regional Adaptation Decisions&#151;Selected 
  Examples </h3>
<p>Sectoral adaptation decisions must be considered in the broader regional context 
  in which evolution in related sectors and their responses to changing climatic 
  conditions represent additional factors to consider in planning a given sector's 
  own adaptation strategy. This process is likely to involve a broad mix of private 
  and public stakeholders and their interactions. From the perspectives of regional 
  planners and policymakers who are responsible for the overall socioeconomic 
  development of a specific region, the challenge is to create conditions under 
  which relevant sectoral actors can formulate their own adaptive strategies efficiently 
  and install public policies that will help adaptation in sectors that provide 
  public services and manage public resources.</p>
<p>Designing and implementing regional climate change studies that incorporate 
  full-fledged DAFs to support the development of regional climate adaptation 
  policies has proven to be an insurmountable challenge to date. This is understandable, 
  in view of the difficulties involved, and indicates a crucial research area 
  for the future.</p>
<p>Most statements on regional adaptation policies in the literature stem from 
  limited but logical extensions of sectoral climate impact assessment studies. 
  Once possible biophysical changes and their direct or indirect socioeconomic 
  consequences are established, impact assessors mention a few options that could 
  mitigate those impacts or moderate their consequences. Seldom are these lists 
  comprehensive, and they scarcely entail even direct cost estimates, let alone 
  assessments of indirect costs and ancillary benefits involved in the specified 
  adaptation options.</p>
<p>The study by Ringius <i>et al</i>. (1996) on climate change vulnerability and 
  adaptation in Africa is a good example. Focusing on impacts on agriculture and 
  water, the authors develop a typology of adaptive responses and discuss their 
  effectiveness from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Although the 
  study is extremely useful in pointing out that a convenient and crucial starting 
  point for decisions on adapting to expected climate change in Africa is to reduce 
  present vulnerability and enhance the capacity to respond to any environmental 
  and economic perturbations (not just climate and weather), no attempt has been 
  made to evaluate the costs and benefits of different options or to rank them 
  in terms of their effectiveness.</p>
<p>An early policy-oriented impact assessment study adopted the PE approach to 
  synthesize results of sectoral studies in a DAF in selected countries in southeast 
  Asia (Toth, 1992a,b). The project included data collection, modeling, completion 
  of first-order impact assessments, analysis of socioeconomic impacts on the 
  impact assessment side, development of background scenarios, and pre-interviews 
  with "policy" participants as preparations for PE workshops. The results 
  of these workshops indicate that the PE approach might be a useful tool in structuring 
  the numerous uncertain facets that are related to developing robust regional 
  adaptation policies.</p>
<p>A partially integrated regional cost-benefit assessment has been prepared for 
  the entire coastal area of Poland (Zeidler, 1997). Scenarios of sea-level rise 
  have been combined with different assumptions about socioeconomic development 
  in the potentially affected coastal region to explore mainly direct and relatively 
  easy-to-estimate costs and benefits of three specifically defined adaptation 
  strategies: retreat (no adaptation), limited protection, and full protection. 
  Because of its numerous merits and despite its limitations, this study has demonstrated 
  the feasibility of using CBA to formulate climate change adaptation problems 
  in a simple DAF and the potential usefulness of its results to policymakers.</p>
