<h2>11.3. Vulnerability and Adaptation Potential </h2>
<h3><a name="1131"></a>11.3.1. Resilience of Resources, Populations, and Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The adaptive capacity of a resource system or a human society depends on the 
  resilience of these systems. Resilience in the face of climate change, as with 
  resilience to present-day hazards such as floods and droughts, therefore depends 
  on the scale, intensity, and rate of change of the climate system, as well as 
  the inherent ability of ecosystems or communities to adjust to new circumstances 
  (Riebsame et al., 1995). Resilience is the ability of a system to return to 
  a predisturbed state without incurring any lasting fundamental change. Resilient 
  resource systems recover to some normal range of operation after a perturbation. 
  The processes of short-term adjustment to changes in land productivity and food 
  scarcity in traditional societies of Asian countries are resilient to perturbations. 
  This resilience has been demonstrated in a range of resource systems throughout 
  Asia, including highland agriculture, large-scale irrigated agriculture, and 
  fishery-dependent communities (e.g., Bray, 1986; Bayliss-Smith, 1991; Tang 1992; 
  Grove et al., 1998; Ruddle, 1998; Adger, 1999a). Long-term adaptation to climate 
  change requires anticipatory actions, which would require considerable investment 
  of capital, labor, and time hence diversion from scarce available resources, 
  existing services, and infrastructure. Constraints on such resources clearly 
  are more acute in the developing countries of Asia. The three crucial sectors 
  of land resources, water resources, and food productivity are of highest priority 
  for planned adaptation, particularly for the poorer resource-dependent countries. 
</p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change in Asian countries depends on the real cost of 
  adaptive measures, the existence and engagement of appropriate institutions, 
  access to technology, and biophysical constraints such as land and water resource 
  availability, soil characteristics, genetic diversity for crop breeding (e.g., 
  development of heat-resistant rice cultivars), and topography. Demand for land 
  and water already is increasing to support growing populations, increased agricultural 
  activities, and expanding modern urban infrastructure. Most developing countries 
  in Asia face significant impacts from present-day climatic hazards. Faced with 
  impending floods, the economic insecurity of communities and rural households, 
  lack of timely warnings, ignorance of the severity of danger from flood, and 
  lack of efficient transport systems, some developing countries of Asia often 
  choose not to evacuate homes to avoid climate-related disasters. Such circumstances 
  also act as constraints for the alleviation of poverty and hence reinforce social 
  vulnerability. For many developing countries in Asia, climate change is only 
  one of a host of environmental problems; these countries have to individually 
  and collectively evaluate the tradeoffs between climate change actions and nearer 
  term needs (such as food security, air and water pollution, and energy demand). 
  Adaptation measures designed to anticipate the potential effects of climate 
  change can help to offset many of the negative effects (Burton, 1997). Adaptation 
  measures that ameliorate the impacts of present-day climate variability include 
  sea defenses, institutional adaptations, plant breeding, and adoption of new 
  technologies in agriculture. Many countries in Asia already commit significant 
  resources to ameliorating climate-related hazards (e.g., Golubtsov et al., 1996; 
  Nishioka and Harasawa, 1998; Ali, 1999; Huq et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Development and broad application of integrated modeling efforts (those that 
  consider interactions of biophysical and socioeconomic factors) and modeling 
  approaches that are particularly applicable at the regional scale warrant increased 
  attention. For example, mountain systems in Asia are vulnerable with respect 
  to ecological and social systems, for reasons of high heterogeneity. Management 
  of Asia's mountain landscape therefore demands diversified strategies that 
  link ecological and social components for location-specific solutions (Ehrenfeld, 
  1991; Ramakrishnan, 1992). Inclusion of complex feedbacks between systems may 
  change significantly the current "mean" estimate of impacts.</p>
<p>Sustainable development within Asia's agroecosystems is crucial to provide 
  adequate food security for traditional farming communities in the lowlands and 
  the uplands in developing countries and to ensure in situ conservation of crop 
  biodiversity for sustaining high-input modern agriculture itself. However, conserving 
  biodiversity with concerns for higher production from these complex agroecosystems 
  is a challenging task, for which novel development alternatives are required 
  (Ramakrishnan, 1992; Ramakrishnan et al., 1996; Swift et al., 1996). Traditional 
  societies have always manipulated biodiversity to ensure ecosystem resilience 
  and to cope with uncertainties in the environment, rather than to increase production 
  on a short-term basis. There is increasing evidence now to suggest that we could 
  learn from their traditional ecological knowledge base (Gadgil et al., 1993) 
  for coping with uncertainties associated with global change.</p>
<p>The resilience of agricultural practices in the face of climate change depends 
  on the nature and magnitude of region-specific climate change, regional sensitivity, 
  or the threshold and social resilience and adaptive capacity of agricultural 
  communities. Adjustment of planting dates to minimize the effect of temperature 
  increase-induced spikelet sterility can be used to reduce yield instability, 
  for example, by avoiding having the flowering period to coincide with the hottest 
  period. Adaptation measures to reduce the negative effects of increased climatic 
  variability may include changing the cropping calendar to take advantage of 
  the wet period and to avoid extreme weather events (e.g., typhoons and storms) 
  during the growing season. Crop varieties that are resistant to lodging (e.g., 
  short rice cultivars) may withstand strong winds during the sensitive stage 
  of crop growth. A combination of farm-level adaptations and economic adjustments 
  such as increased investment in agriculture infrastructure and reallocation 
  of existing land and water resources would be desired in the agriculture sector. 
  Increasing demand for water by competing sectors may limit the viability of 
  irrigation as a sustainable adaptation to climate change. Expansion of irrigation 
  as a response to climate change will be difficult and costly in many of the 
  countries in Asia even under favorable circumstances. Mounting societal pressures 
  to reduce environmental degradation will likely foster an increase in protective 
  regulatory policies, further complicating adaptations to climate change (Easterling, 
  1996). </p>
<p>A commonly prescribed adaptation to climate change in the water sector is to 
  enhance characteristics that offer flexibility hence enhancing resilience. Flexibility 
  issues are particularly important with regard to the development of water resources 
  for industry or agriculture. Major projects such as dams actually may limit 
  flexibility if they lose effectiveness as regional hydrological water balances 
  undergo major changes. With likely changes in climate variability, dams and 
  sea defenses built to withstand a 100-year extreme event may not be adequate 
  thus leading to a risk of major catastrophe. If hydrological patterns change 
  markedly and irrigated agriculture is required to relocate in response, prior 
  investments may be lost as existing infrastructures become obsolete, and additional 
  investments will be needed. This necessitates critical scrutiny of a range of 
  available choices that incorporate economic and environmental concerns. The 
  potential for adaptation should not lead to complacency (Rosenzweig and Hillel, 
  1995). Some adaptive measures may have detrimental impacts of their own.</p>
<p>The issue of natural resource management in Asia has a highly complex set of 
  interconnections between natural and social systems. Natural resource management 
  in largely rural tropical environments must reconcile ecological and social 
  processes that operate at a range of scales, from species up to the landscape 
  level. Studies have shown that ecologically important keystone species often 
  are socially selected by many rural societies (Jodha, 1996). The possibility 
  for species selection for rehabilitating a degraded ecosystem should be based 
  on a value system that the local people understand and appreciate; therefore, 
  their participation in the process of developmental activity is important. Community 
  perceptions of soil and water management can be a powerful agent for sustainable 
  management of natural resources (e.g., in the case of highly fragile and vulnerable 
  Himalayan mountain systems) (Ramakrishnan et al., 1994). In other words, natural 
  resource management in tropical Asia must be sensitive to social and even cultural 
  perceptions (Ramakrishnan, 1998), as well as traditional resource management 
  practices.</p>
<p>Major fishery-related environmental issues include the effects of trawling 
  on sea-bottom habitats and the detrimental effects of catches of nontarget species 
  on populations and ecosystems. Fishery resources also are threatened by activities 
  other than commercial fishing. Loss of inshore fish nursery habitats from coastal 
  development and pollution from land-based activities cause significant change 
  to ecosystems that support fisheries. Effective conservation and sustainable 
  management of marine and inland fisheries are needed at the regional level so 
  that living aquatic resources can continue to meet regional and national nutritional 
  needs. Asian economic growth has failed to alleviate poverty for a large share 
  of Asian people to date. Achieving economic and industrial growth in Asia that 
  is sustainable&#151;both ecologically and economically viable over the long 
  term&#151;would require more than just cleaner, more efficient industrial processes; 
  it demands a reorientation toward becoming less material-intensive and attempting 
  to contribute toward protecting our environment and ecosystem.</p>
