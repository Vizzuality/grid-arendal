<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p><ul><li> The adaptation potential of socioeconomic systems in Europe is relatively 
  high because of economic conditions (high gross national product and stable 
  growth); a stable population (with the capacity to move within the region); 
  and well-developed political, institutional, and technological support systems. 
  However, adaptation potential for natural systems generally is low. [very high 
  confidence] <p><li> Present-day weather conditions have effects on natural, social, 
  and economic systems in Europe in ways that reveal sensitivities and vulnerabilities 
  to climate change in these systems. Climate change may aggravate such effects. 
  [very high confidence, well-established evidence] <p><li> Vulnerability to climate 
  change in Europe differs substantially between subregions; it is particularly 
  high in the south and in the European Arctic. This has important equity implications. 
  More marginal and less wealthy areas will be less able to adapt. [very high 
  confidence, established but incomplete evidence] <p><li> Water resources and their 
  management in Europe are under pressure now, and these pressures are likely 
  to be exacerbated by climate change [high confidence]. Flood hazard is likely 
  to increase across much of Europe, except where snowmelt peak has been reduced, 
  and the risk of water shortage is projected to increase particularly in southern 
  Europe [medium to high confidence]. Climate change is likely to widen water 
  resource differences between northern and southern Europe. [high confidence, 
  well-established evidence] <p><li> Soil properties will deteriorate under warmer and 
  drier climate scenarios in southern Europe. The magnitude of this effect will 
  vary markedly between geographic locations and may be modified by changes in 
  precipitation. [medium confidence, established but incomplete evidence] <p><li> Natural 
  ecosystems will change as a result of increasing temperature and atmospheric 
  concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Permafrost will decline, trees and shrubs 
  will encroach northern tundra, and broad-leaved trees may encroach coniferous 
  forests. Net primary productivity in ecosystems is likely to increase (also 
  as a result of nitrogen deposition). Diversity in nature reserves is under threat 
  from rapid change. Loss of important habitats (wetlands, tundra, and isolated 
  habitats) would threaten some species (including rare/endemic species and migratory 
  birds). Faunal shifts as a result of ecosystem changes are expected in marine, 
  aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems. [high confidence, established but incomplete 
  evidence] <p><li> In mountain regions, higher temperatures will lead to an upward 
  shift of biotic and cryospheric zones and perturb the hydrological cycle. There 
  will be redistribution of species, with, in some instances, a threat of extinction. 
  [high confidence] <p><li> Timber harvest will increase in commercial forests in northern 
  Europe [medium confidence, established but incomplete evidence], but reductions 
  are likely in the Mediterranean, with increased drought and fire risk. [high 
  confidence, well-established evidence] <p>
  <li> Agricultural yields will increase for most crops as a result of increasing 
    atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This effect would be 
    counteracted by the risk of water shortage in southern and eastern Europe 
    and by shortening of growth duration in many grain crops as a result of increasing 
    temperature. Northern Europe is likely to experience overall positive effects, 
    whereas some agricultural production systems in southern Europe may be threatened. 
    [medium confidence, established but incomplete evidence] 
    <p><li> Changes 
  in fisheries and aquaculture production from climate change embrace faunal shifts 
  affecting freshwater and marine fish and shellfish biodiversity. These changes 
  will be aggravated by unsustainable exploitation levels and environmental change. 
  [high confidence] <p><li> The insurance industry faces potentially costly climate 
  change impacts through the medium of property damage, but there is great scope 
  for adaptive measures if initiatives are taken soon. [high confidence] <p><li> Transport, 
  energy, and other industries will face changing demand and market opportunities. 
  Concentration of industry on the coast exposes it to sea-level rise and extreme 
  events, necessitating protection or removal. [high confidence] <p><li> Recreational 
  preferences are likely to change with higher temperatures. Outdoor activities 
  will be stimulated in northern Europe, but heat waves are likely to reduce the 
  traditional peak summer demand at Mediterranean holiday destinations, and less 
  reliable snow conditions could impact adversely on winter tourism. [medium confidence] 
  <p><li> A range of risks is posed for human health through increased exposure to heat 
  episodes (exacerbated by air pollution in urban areas), extension of some vector-borne 
  diseases, and coastal and riverine flooding. Based on current evidence, climate 
  change would result in a reduction in wintertime deaths, at least in temperate 
  countries. [medium confidence] 
<p><li> In coastal areas, the risk of flooding, erosion, and wetland loss will increase 
  substantially-with implications for human settlement, industry, tourism, agriculture, 
  and coastal natural habitats. Southern Europe appears to be more vulnerable 
  to these changes, although the North Sea coast already has high exposure to 
  flooding. [high confidence] </ul>
<p>The foregoing conclusions are broadly consistent with those expressed in the 
  IPCC Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (1998) and the Second 
  Assessment Report (1996). This survey incorporates much more information than 
  previously reported, corroborating previous conclusions (with which it is broadly 
  consistent) but extending knowledge into other sectors. It is more specific 
  about subregional effects and includes new information concerning adaptive capacity.</p>
