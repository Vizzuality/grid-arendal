<h4>11.2.2.3. Food Security </h4>
<p>A major new challenge in future food production to meet the demand of the growing 
  Asian population is in coping with the changing environment, which may alter 
  the current optimum growing requirement of agricultural crops. The potential 
  impacts of climate change on agriculture in Asia are crucial because of agriculture's 
  ultimate role in providing food and fiber to Asia's human population. Countries 
  in south and southeast Asia have shown strong reductions in undernourished population 
  in the 1990s. Even so, it has been estimated that almost two-thirds (more than 
  500 million) of undernourished people live in developing countries of Asia and 
  the Pacific. South Asia accounts for more than one-third of the world total 
  (258 million). Another 64 million undernourished people live in southeast Asia; 
  more than 160 million live in China (FAO, 1999b). The undernourished population 
  almost doubled between 1995 and 1999&#151;from 6 to 12%&#151;as a result of 
  the economic crisis in Indonesia. With the highest incidences of undernutrition 
  and a very large population of children under the age of five, south Asia accounts 
  for almost half of the world's underweight and stunted children (see <a href="#box112">Box 
  11-2</a>). <a href="437.htm#tab116">Table 11-6</a> lists the prevalence of undernourishment 
  in Asian developing countries. </p>

        <p><b>Box 11-2. Bangladesh: Food Insecurity in an Agrarian Nation </b></p>
        </div>
      <p>Malnutrition remains endemic in Bangladesh, an overwhelmingly agrarian 
        country where most rural households do not own land and have few other 
        opportunities to earn wage income. At barely 2,000 kilocalories per person 
        per day, food availability falls short of meeting basic requirements. 
        With extensive poverty, malnutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate 
        access to health care, the country is vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious, 
        water-borne, or other types of diseases. Less than half the population 
        of Bangladesh currently has access to adequate sanitation. Some areas 
        of the country still face the risk of famine; others have frequent floods 
        and often are devastated by cyclones and storm surges.</p>
      <p>Overall, the rate of undernourishment is very high (37%), as is the prevalence 
        of underweight, stunting, and wasting among children (<a href="#fig119">Figure 
        11-9</a>). Rates are high throughout the rural areas that are home to 
        80% of Bangladesh's population. More than 60% of rural households 
        are functionally landless, and there are limited opportunities for income 
        diversification (Mimura and Harasawa, 2000). The level of vulnerability 
        is likely to increase as a result of severe land degradation, soil erosion, 
        lack of appropriate technology, and the threat of sea-level rise from 
        global warming. Climate change could result in a decreased supply of water 
        and soil moisture during the dry season, increasing the demand for irrigation 
        while supply drops. Improving irrigation efficiency and agricultural productivity 
        will help make Bangladesh self-sufficient in crop production and reduce 
        malnourishment. Higher yields may enable the country to store food supplies 
        to carry it through low-harvest years (Azam, 1996). A switch to growing 
        higher value crops and expansion of free market reforms in agriculture 
        may enable Bangladesh to sell more crops for export. Diversification should 
        help in providing robustness to withstand climate change and variability.</p>
