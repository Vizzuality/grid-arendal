<h3><a name="1733"></a>17.3.3. Vulnerability </h3>
<p>Despite their heterogeneity, small island states share some common characteristics 
  that help to define their high vulnerability and low adaptation potential to 
  climate change effects (Nurse <i>et al.,</i> 1998; see also <a href="621.htm#1712">Section 
  17.1.2</a>). Vulnerability assessment typically seeks to achieve three main 
  goals: to identify the degree of future risks induced by climate change and 
  sea-level rise; to identify the key vulnerable sectors and areas within a country; 
  and to provide a sound basis for designing adaptation strategies and their implementation.</p>
<p>The IPCC Common Methodology was the first method to be widely applied to assess 
  the vulnerability of countries to sea-level rise (IPCC, 1992). However, the 
  methodology lacks the flexibility to consider factors of critical significance 
  for small islands (e.g., so-called nonmarket goods and services) and requires 
  certain quantitative data that often are not easily available in many small 
  island states. An index-based method was developed for use in the south Pacific 
  (Yamada <i>et al.,</i> 1995, based on Kay and Hay, 1993). In addition, alternative 
  assessment methodologies were developed in conjunction with the various country 
  study programs (e.g., Leatherman, 1996; Klein and Nicholls, 1998). What is significant, 
  however, is that all available assessments confirm the high vulnerability of 
  small island states to climate change, independent of the methodology applied. 
  As already noted, global assessments come to the same conclusions (Nicholls 
  <i>et al., </i>1999). This is therefore a robust finding, which must be of considerable 
  concern to these countries. </p>
<div align="right"> 
  <div align="left">Climate change is expected to be one factor among many that 
    affect ecological systems and economic development. Other factors that interact 
    with climate change include overexploitation of resources, pollution, increasing 
    nutrient fluxes, decreasing freshwater availability, sediment starvation, 
    and urbanization (Goldberg, 1994; Viles and Spencer, 1995). Particularly relevant 
    for small island states are rapid population growth, intra- and inter-island 
    migration, rapid changes in social structure, and effects of economic globalization. 
    These nonclimate stresses can decrease the resilience of natural and human 
    systems, increasing their vulnerability to climate variability and anticipated 
    climate change (Nicholls and Branson, 1998; Klein and Nicholls, 1999). </div>
</div>
<p>Most vulnerability indices developed to date have focused on economic and social 
  systems, although studies by Ehrlich and Ehrlich (1991) and Atkins <i>et al.</i> 
  (1998) focus on environmental vulnerability. The economic vulnerability indices 
  include those developed by Briguglio (1995, 1997), the Commonwealth Secretariat 
  (Wells, 1996, 1997; Atkins <i>et al., </i>1998), Pantin (1997), and the Caribbean 
  Development Bank (Crowards, 1999). Another index, the Environmental Vulnerability 
  Index, has been developed recently for small island states, particularly countries 
  for which data availability is limited. It incorporates climate, nonclimate, 
  and human stresses on the environment and seeks to reflect relative vulnerability 
  as a function of these combined factors (Kaly <i>et al.,</i> 1999). All vulnerability 
  indices consistently identify small states&#151;sometimes more specifically 
  small island states&#151;as being more economically vulnerable than larger states.</p>
<p>Most existing studies have fulfilled the first two of the three aforementioned 
  goals of vulnerability assessment, although information on socioeconomic impacts 
  of climate change often is limited. The third goal&#151;to provide a basis to 
  guide possible adaptation&#151;usually is met only in general terms. Effective 
  planning and design of adaptation strategies requires more detailed information 
  on crucial vulnerable sectors and areas. Such information may be partly derived 
  from analysis at an integrated level (see <a href="#box172">Box 17-2</a>)&#151;as 
  suggested, for instance, by Klein and Nicholls (1999).</p>

          Adaptation Policy Development </b> </div>
        <p>The numerous and well-developed interactions between the natural and human 
          systems of island countries underscore the relevance of integrated assessment 
          as a meaningful analytical tool for designing adaptation strategies. 
          One such tool that has proven particularly beneficial is VANDACLIM, 
          an integrated assessment model developed by the International Global 
          Change Institute (University of Waikato, New Zealand), in collaboration 
          with the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and United 
          Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) (Warrick <i>et 
          al.,</i> 1999). Enhanced and country-specific versions of VANDACLIM 
          currently are being developed.</p>
        <p>Development of VANDACLIM involved linking a regional scenario generator 
          with selected impact models for four key sectors: agriculture, coastal 
          zones, human health, and water resources. The user has considerable 
          flexibility in generating scenarios; the user can choose among a large 
          range of projections from GHG emission scenarios; the low, mid, or high 
          cases from each projection (which encompasses the range of uncertainty 
          in model parameter values); several GCM patterns; and the year of interest 
          (in 5-year increments from 1990 to 2100).</p>
        <p>VANDACLIM integrates a variant of the "Bruun rule" with a 
          simple inundation model that is suitable for flat, low-lying deltaic 
          coastal plains. Health impacts projections are derived from a biophysical 
          index that estimates potential incidence of malaria and a simple threshold 
          index for estimating change in the risk of cholera outbreaks related 
          to extreme flooding events. For water resources, three models are included: 
          an atmospheric water balance model for assessing the overall water resource 
          situation for the country; a water balance-river discharge model for 
          estimating monthly mean discharge for estimating wet and dry season 
          river flow; and a discharge-flood area model for defining the areal 
          extent of flooding. For agriculture, various crop models and indices 
          are integrated, including degree-day models, rainfall (soil moisture), 
          a land suitability index, and temperature for a variety of tropical 
          crops.</p>
