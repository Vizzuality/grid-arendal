<h2>9.5. Extreme Events and Weather Disasters </h2>
<p>Major impacts of climate change on human health are likely to occur via changes 
  in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>), which trigger a natural disaster or emergency. In developed countries, 
  emergency preparedness has decreased the total number of tropical cyclone-related 
  deaths (see <a href="309.htm">Section 7.2.2</a>). However, in developed countries, 
  studies indicate an increasing trend in the number and impacts (deaths, injuries, 
  economic losses) of all types of natural disasters (IFRC, 1998; Munich Re, 1999). 
  Some of the interannual variability in rates of persons affected by disasters 
  may be associated with El Ni&ntilde;o (Bouma <i>et al</i>., 1997a). The average 
  annual number of people killed by natural disasters between 1972 and 1996 was 
  about 123,000. By far the largest number of people affected (i.e., in need of 
  shelter or medical care) are in Asia, and one study reveals that Africa suffers 
  60% of all disaster-related deaths (Loretti and Tegegn, 1996). </p>
<p>Populations in developing countries are much more affected by extreme events. 
  Relative to low socioeconomic conditions, the impact of weather-related disasters 
  in poor countries may be 20-30 times larger than in industrialized countries. 
  For example, floods and drought associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o event of 
  1982-1983 led to losses of about 10% in gross national product (GNP) in 
  countries such as Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru (50% of their annual public 
  revenue) (Jovel, 1989). </p>

<p><a name="fig91"></a>Disasters occur when climate hazards and population vulnerability 
  converge. Factors that affect vulnerability to disasters are shown in <a href="#fig91">Figure 
  9-1</a>. The increase in population vulnerability to extreme weather is primarily 
  caused by the combination of population growth, poverty, and environmental degradation 
  (Alexander, 1993). Concentration of people and property in high-risk areas (e.g., 
  floodplains and coastal zones) also has increased. Degradation of the local 
  environment also may contribute to vulnerability (see <a href="305.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>).</p>
<p>The health impacts of natural disasters include (Noji, 1997):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical injury.</li>
  <li>Decreases in nutritional status, especially in children.</li>
  <li>Increases in respiratory and diarrheal diseases resulting from crowding 
    of survivors, often with limited shelter and access to potable water</li>
  <li>Impacts on mental health, which in some cases may be long-lasting</li>
  <li>Increased risk of water-related diseases as a result of disruption of water 
    supply or sewage systems</li>
  <li>Release and dissemination of dangerous chemicals from storage sites and 
    waste disposal sites into floodwaters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extreme weather events cause death and injury directly. However, substantial 
  indirect health impacts also occur because of damage to the local infrastructure 
  and population displacement (see also <a href="369.htm">Section 9.10</a>). Following 
  disasters, fatalities and injuries can occur as residents return to clean up 
  damage and debris (Philen <i>et al</i>., 1992). Bereavement, property loss, 
  and social disruption may increase the risk of depression and mental health 
  problems (WHO, 1992). For example, cases of post-traumatic stress disorder were 
  reported in the United States up to 2 years after Hurricane Andrew (Norris <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999). <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="951"></a>9.5.1. Floods </h3>
<p>Floods are associated with particular dangers to human populations (Menne <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999). Climate change may increase the risk of river and coastal flooding 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="283.htm">6</a>). The health 
  impacts of floods may be divided into the immediate, medium, and long terms. 
  Immediate effects are largely death and injuries caused by drowning and being 
  swept against hard objects. Medium-term effects include increases in communicable 
  diseases such as those caused by ingestion of contaminated water (e.g., cholera, 
  hepatitis A), contact with contaminated water (e.g., leptospirosis&#151;see 
  <a href="365.htm#9791">Section 9.7.9.1</a>), or respiratory diseases resulting 
  from overcrowding in shelters. A study in populations displaced by catastrophic 
  floods in Bangladesh in 1988 found that diarrhea was the most common illness, 
  followed by respiratory infection. Watery diarrhea was the most common cause 
  of death for all age groups under 45 (Siddique <i>et al</i>., 1991). In rural 
  Bangladesh and Khartoum, Sudan, the proportion of severely malnourished children 
  increased after flooding (Woodruff <i>et al</i>., 1990; Choudhury and Bhuiya, 
  1993). Also, in the aftermath of flooding, molds and fungi may grow on interior 
  surfaces, providing a potent stimulus to allergic persons (American Academy 
  of Pediatrics, 1998).</p>
<p>In China, floods experienced over the past few years have been particularly 
  severe. In 1996, official national statistics showed 200 million people affected 
  by flooding: There were more than 3,000 deaths, and 363,800 people were injured; 
  3.7 million houses were destroyed, and 18 million houses were damaged. Direct 
  economic loses exceeded US$12 billion (IFRC 1997). In 1998, official national 
  statistics showed 200 million people affected by flooding, more than 3,000 deaths, 
  and 4 million houses damaged; direct economic losses exceeded US$20 billion 
  (National Climate Centre of China, 1998). Nevertheless, the vulnerability of 
  the Chinese population has been reduced by a combination of better preparedness, 
  including sophisticated warning systems, and relief efforts. In the longer term, 
  reforestation may reduce the risk of flooding in these regions.</p>
<p>In developed countries, physical and disease risks from flooding are greatly 
  reduced by a well-maintained flood control and sanitation infrastructure and 
  public health measures, such as monitoring and surveillance activities to detect 
  and control outbreaks of infectious disease. However, the experience of the 
  central European floods of 1997, when more than 100 people died, showed that 
  even in industrialized countries floods can have a major impact on health and 
  welfare. In Poland, 6,000 km2 were flooded, and 160,000 people were evacuated 
  from their homes. The cost of the damage was estimated at US$3 billion [2.7% 
  of 1996 gross domestic product (GDP)]. In the Czech Republic, 50,000 people 
  were evacuated and damage was estimated at US$1.8 billion (3.7% of GDP) (IFRC, 
  1998). There was an increase in cases of leptospirosis in the Czech Republic 
  (Kriz <i>et al</i>., 1998). Floods also have an important impact on mental health 
  in the affected community (WHO, 1992; Menne <i>et al</i>., 1999). Increases 
  in suicide, alcoholism, and psychological and behavioral disorders, particularly 
  among children, were reported following floods in Poland in 1997 (IFRC 1998).</p>
