<h3>19.1.4. Chapter Organization </h3>
<p>The chapter is organized into the following sections:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li> <a href="663.htm">Section 19.2</a> addresses the insights we can gain by 
    examining observed effects of climate change. Are we seeing impacts of climate 
    change on nature and society?<br>
  <li> <a href="667.htm">Section 19.3</a> addresses what changes in global mean 
    temperature may cause harm to threatened and unique systems. For example, 
    are threatened and unique systems at risk from even low levels of increase 
    in global mean temperature? Are some societies at particular risk at low levels 
    of temperature increase? <br>
  <li> <a href="673.htm">Section 19.4</a> addresses the evidence regarding the 
    relationship between change in global mean temperature and distribution of 
    impacts. Are adverse or positive impacts from climate change distributed equally 
    around the world and within countries? Are some regions harmed at certain 
    levels of climate change while others benefit? Are some subgroups or cultures 
    at greater risk than the population as a whole? <br>
  <li> <a href="676.htm">Section 19.5</a> addresses what insights we gain from 
    aggregate or comprehensive approaches to measuring impacts. What do approaches 
    such as monetization or looking at the number of people who are harmed or 
    benefited tell us about the relationship between aggregate impacts and higher 
    temperatures? This section also addresses insights gained from integrated 
    assessment models (IAMs).<br>
  <li> <a href="679.htm">Section 19.6</a> addresses the potential for increases 
    in extreme climate events and large-scale singular effects. As temperatures 
    increase or the rate of temperature rise increases, does the potential for 
    extreme climate events and singular effects such as a change in ocean circulation 
    patterns or the collapse of ice sheets increase? Can thresholds of change 
    in terms of magnitudes or rates of change be identified?<br>
  <li> <a href="683.htm">Section 19.7</a> addresses the limitations of the information 
    used in this chapter to address observations and the reasons for concern. 
    It also addresses future research that is needed to narrow these uncertainties.<br>
  <li> <a href="685.htm">Section 19.8</a> summarizes the findings on observations 
    and the reasons for concern. 
</ul>
<p><a href="663.htm">Sections 19.2</a> and <a href="667.htm">19.3</a> draw most 
  heavily on the TAR. Examples can be found in the region and sector chapters 
  of this report; the sections in this chapter do not introduce new information. 
  Instead, they synthesize that information in ways that the other chapters are 
  unable to because they do not examine all regions and sectors. <a href="673.htm">Sections 
  19.4</a>, <a href="676.htm">19.5</a>, and <a href="679.htm">19.6</a> draw on 
  information that is not found in the regional and sectoral chapters. They do 
  so because they address issues that those chapters cannot:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li> Comparison of impacts across regions (<a href="673.htm">Section 19.4</a>). 
    The sectoral chapters do this for each sector, but this can be done comprehensively 
    only in this chapter.<br>
  <li> Aggregation of impacts (<a href="676.htm">Section 19.5</a>). This requires 
    use of common metrics to aggregate impacts across sectors and regions. None 
    of the other chapters can do this.<br>
  <li> Examination of changes in extreme events and large-scale discontinuities 
    (<a href="679.htm">Section 19.6</a>). This generally is not addressed in the 
    region and sector chapters because the climate change scenarios that are used 
    most commonly in impacts studies examine only changes in average conditions, 
    not changes in extreme events or large-scale discontinuities (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 
    4</a>). 
</ul>
<p>Thus, this chapter contains much new information in a framework that can help 
  readers judge what may considered to be a dangerous level of climate change.</p>
