<h3>6.4.3. Deltaic Coasts</h3>
<p>In addition to increasing erosion, many of the world's low-lying coastal 
  regions will be exposed to potential inundation. Deltas that are deteriorating 
  as a result of sediment starvation, subsidence, and other stresses are particularly 
  susceptible to accelerated inundation, shoreline recession, wetland deterioration, 
  and interior land loss (Biljsma <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Day <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<p>River deltas are among the most valuable, heavily populated, and vulnerable 
  coastal systems in the world. Deltas develop where rivers deposit more sediment 
  at the shore than can be carried away by waves. Deltas are particularly at risk 
  from climate change&#151;partly because of natural processes and partly because 
  of human-induced stresses. Deltaic deposits naturally dewater and compact as 
  a result of sedimentary loading. When compaction is combined with isostatic 
  loading or other tectonic effects, rates of subsidence can reach 20 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (Alam, 1996). Human activities such as draining for agricultural development; 
  levee building to prevent flooding; and channelization, damming, and diking 
  of rivers to impede sediment transfers have made deltas more vulnerable to sea-level 
  rise. Examples of sediment starvation include the Rhone and Ebro deltas (Jimenez 
  and Sanchez-Arcilla, 1997) and polder projects in the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Jelgersma, 
  1996). Sediment transport by the Nile, Indus, and Ebro Rivers has been reduced 
  by 95% and in the Mississippi by half in the past 200 years, mostly since 1950 
  (Day <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Further stress has been caused by subsurface fluid withdrawals 
  and draining of wetland soils. In the Bangkok area of the Chao Phraya delta, 
  groundwater extraction during 1960-1994 increased average relative sea-level 
  rise by 17 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Sabhasri and Suwarnarat, 1996). Similar severe land subsidence 
  has been experienced in the Old Huange and Changjiang deltas of China (Chen, 
  1998; Chen and Stanley, 1998). In the latter case, groundwater removal was curtailed, 
  leading to a reduction in subsidence rates. </p>
<p>Where local rates of subsidence and relative sea-level rise are not balanced 
  by sediment accumulation, flooding and marine processes will dominate. Indeed, 
  Sanchez-Arcilla and Jimenez (1997) suggest that in the case of largely regulated 
  deltas, the main impacts of climate change will be marine-related because impacts 
  related to catchment areas will be severely damped by river regulation and management 
  policies. In such cases, significant land loss on the outer delta can result 
  from wave erosion; prominent examples include the Nile (Stanley and Warne, 1998), 
  Mackenzie (Shaw <i>et al.</i>, 1998b), and Ganges (Umitsu, 1997). In South America, 
  large portions of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paran&aacute;/Plata deltas will be 
  affected if sea-level rise accelerates as projected (Canziani <i>et al.</i>, 1998). 
  If vertical accretion rates resulting from sediment delivery and in situ organic 
  matter production do not keep pace with sea-level rise, waterlogging of wetland 
  soils will lead to death of emergent vegetation, a rapid loss of elevation because 
  of decomposition of the belowground root mass, and, ultimately, submergence 
  and erosion of the substrate (Cahoon and Lynch, 1997). </p>
<p>In some situations, saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers also is a 
  potentially major problem, as demonstrated by a three-scenario climate change 
  and sea-level rise model study of the Nile delta (Sherif and Singh, 1999). In 
  other places, saltwater intrusion is already taking place (Mulrenna and Woodroffe, 
  1998). In the Yangtze delta, one consequence of saltwater incursion will be 
  that during dry seasons shortages of freshwater for agriculture are likely to 
  be more pronounced and agricultural yields seriously reduced particularly around 
  Shanghai (Chen and Zong, 1999).</p>

<h3>6.4.4. Coastal Wetlands</h3>
<p>An estimate by Nicholls <i>et al.</i> (1999) suggests that by the 2080s, sea-level 
  rise could cause the loss of as much as 22% of the world's coastal wetlands. 
  Although there would be significant regional variations (Michener <i>et al.</i>, 1997), 
  such losses would reinforce other adverse trends of wetland loss resulting primarily 
  from direct human action&#151;estimated by DETR (1999) to be about 40% of 1990 
  values by the 2080s. Stabilization scenarios developed by DETR (1999) show a 
  large reduction in wetland losses&#151;to 6-7%, compared with unmitigated 
  emissions (13%). Two main types of tidal wetland&#151;mangrove forest and salt 
  marsh&#151;are considered here, although serious impacts on other coastal vegetation 
  types, including subtidal seagrasses, can be expected (Short and Neckles, 1999).</p>
<p>Mangrove forests often are associated with tropical and subtropical deltas, 
  but they also occur in low- to mid-latitude lagoon and estuary margins, fringing 
  shorelines from Bermuda in the north to northern New Zealand in the south. Mangroves 
  have important ecological and socioeconomic functions, particularly in relation 
  to seafood production, as a source of wood products, as nutrient sinks, and 
  for shoreline protection (R&ouml;nnb&auml;ck, 1999). Moreover, different kinds 
  of mangrove provide different goods and services (Ewel <i>et al.</i>, 1998). The function 
  and conservation status of mangroves has been considered in special issues of 
  two journals, introduced by Field <i>et al.</i> (1998) and Saenger (1998).</p>
<p>Many mangrove forests are being exploited and some are being destroyed, reducing 
  resilience to accommodate future sea-level rise. In Thailand, 50% of mangrove 
  has been lost in the past 35 years (Aksornkoae, 1993); yet with greatly increased 
  sediment supply to the coastal zone in some places, mangrove colonization has 
  expanded seaward in suitable habitats (Panapitukkul <i>et al.</i>, 1998). As for other 
  shore types, this example emphasizes the importance of sediment flux in determining 
  mangrove response to sea-level rise. Ellison and Stoddart (1991), Ellison (1993), 
  and Parkinson <i>et al.</i> (1994) suggest that mangrove accretion in low- and high-island 
  settings with low sediment supply may not be able to keep up with future sea-level 
  rise, whereas Snedaker <i>et al.</i> (1994) suggest that low-island mangroves may be 
  able to accommodate much higher rates of sea-level rise. This ability may depend 
  on stand composition and status (e.g., Ewel <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Farnsworth, 1998) 
  and other factors, such as tidal range and sediment supply (Woodroffe, 1995, 
  1999; Miyagi <i>et al.</i>, 1999). In some protected coastal settings, inundation of 
  low-lying coastal land may promote progressive expansion of mangroves with sea-level 
  rise (Richmond <i>et al.</i>, 1997). In contrast, Alleng (1998) predicts the complete 
  collapse of a mangrove wetland in Jamaica under rapid sea-level rise.</p>
<p>The response of tidal marshes to sea-level rise is similarly affected by organic 
  and inorganic sediment supply and the nature of the backshore environment (Brinson 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Nuttle <i>et al.</i>, 1997). In general, tidal marsh accretion 
  tracks sea-level rise and fluctuations in the rate of sea-level rise (e.g., 
  van de Plassche <i>et al.</i>, 1998, 1999; Varekamp and Thomas, 1998). Marsh 
  accretion also reflects marsh growth effects (Varekamp <i>et al.</i>, 1999). 
  Bricker-Urso <i>et al.</i> (1989) estimate a maximum sustainable accretion rate 
  of 16 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in salt marshes of Rhode Island (assuming that vertical 
  accretion rates are controlled mainly by in situ production of organic matter); 
  this rate is an order of magnitude higher than rates reported by others. Orson 
  <i>et al.</i> (1998) also emphasizes the effects of variability between marsh 
  species types.</p>
<p>Temporal and spatial variability in rates of relative sea-level rise also is 
  important. Stumpf and Haines (1998) report rates of &gt;10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  in the Gulf of Mexico over several years, where the long-term mean rate of relative 
  sea-level rise is 2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> or less. Forbes <i>et al.</i> (1997b) 
  report multi-year fluctuations in sea-level rise at Halifax, Nova Scotia, of 
  as much as 10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> and occasionally higher, superimposed on a 
  long-term mean of 3.6 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, short-term fluctuations in sea-level 
  rise may approach the maximum limit of accretion, although the drowning of marsh 
  surfaces is unlikely to be a major concern. Higher local rates of sea-level 
  change have been recorded over the past 100 years or so in a few places, one 
  of which is the Caspian Sea. Here, the response of riparian vegetation to the 
  sea-level fall in the early part of the 20th century was a rapid seaward progression 
  of vegetation. This progression ceased with the rise in Caspian sea level averaging 
  120 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> from 1978 to 1996, but it did not result in a similar 
  rapid regression of vegetation. Instead, the vegetation consolidated its position, 
  which has been partly explained by the wide flooding tolerance of the major 
  emergent plant species, with floating vegetation increasing in extent with more 
  favorable (higher water level) conditions (Baldina <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>In some areas, the current rate of marsh elevation gain is insufficient to 
  offset relative sea-level rise. For instance, model results from a wetland elevation 
  model designed to predict the effect of an increasing rate of sea-level rise 
  on wetland sustainability in Venice Lagoon revealed that for a 0.48-m rise in 
  the next 100 years, only one site could maintain its elevation relative to sea 
  level; for a 0.15-m rise, seven sites remained stable (Day <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Maintenance of productive marsh area also depends on horizontal controls discussed 
  by Nuttle <i>et al.</i> (1997) and Cahoon <i>et al.</i> (1998). For example, in settings with 
  sufficient sediment influx, the wetland may expand toward the estuary, while 
  also expanding landward if the backshore slope is sufficiently low and not backed 
  by fixed infrastructure (Brinson <i>et al.</i>, 1995). If sediment supply is low, however, 
  marsh front erosion may occur (Dionne, 1986). </p>
<p>Although determining the threshold for such erosion is difficult, this erosion 
  is regarded as a negative impact on many wetlands, particularly those constrained 
  by artificial structures on the landward side. Nicholls and Branson (1998) use 
  the term "coastal squeeze" to describe the progressive loss and inundation 
  of coastal habitats and natural features located between coastal defenses and 
  rising sea levels. They believe that intertidal habitats will continue to disappear 
  progressively, with adverse consequences for coastal biological productivity, 
  biodiversity, and amenity value. Where sediment influx is insufficient to sustain 
  progradation, there is potential for significant loss of coastal wetlands. After 
  considering two "what if" climate change scenarios, Mortsch (1998) 
  found that key wetlands around the Great Lakes of Canada-USA are at risk&#151;particularly 
  those that are impeded from adapting to the new water-level conditions by artificial 
  structures or geomorphic conditions.</p>
