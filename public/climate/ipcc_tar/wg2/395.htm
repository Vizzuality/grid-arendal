<h4>10.2.3.3. Migratory Species</h4>
<h4>10.2.3.3.1. Large-mammal migratory systems<a name="102331"></a></h4>
<p>The vast herds of migratory ungulates in east and southern Africa remain a 
  distinguishing ecological characteristic of the continent. A major migratory 
  system is located in the Serengeti area of Tanzania and the Masai-Mara region 
  of Kenya. Reduced large-mammal migratory systems persist in the Kalahari (Botswana, 
  South Africa, and Namibia) and Etosha (Namibia) areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Migrations typically are regular, and between dry-season and wet-season grazing 
  areas, and to that extent they are sensitive to climate change. There is currently 
  no indication that the broad pattern of seasonality is likely to change in the 
  Serengeti or the Kalahari, since they are controlled by gross features of the 
  atmospheric circulation (the monsoon system and the position of the Hadley cells). 
  The intensity of seasonality, and the absolute annual rainfall total could change, 
  by about 15% in either direction (Hulme, 1996). This is well within the range 
  of interannual variability. Thus the migratory systems are likely to persist 
  if land-use pressures permit them to.</p>
<h4>10.2.3.3.2. Bird migrations<a name="102332"></a></h4>
<p>About one-fifth of southern African bird species migrate on a seasonal basis 
  within Africa, and a further one-tenth migrate annually between Africa and the 
  rest of the world (Hockey, 2000). A similar proportion can be assumed for Africa 
  as a whole. One of the main intra-Africa migratory patterns involves waterfowl, 
  which spend the austral summer in southern Africa and winter in central Africa. 
  Palearctic migrants spend the austral summer in locations such as Langebaan 
  lagoon, near Cape Town, and the boreal summer in the wetlands of Siberia. If 
  climatic conditions or very specific habitat conditions at either terminus of 
  these migratory routes change beyond the tolerance of the species involved, 
  significant losses of biodiversity could result. Although the species involved 
  have some capacity to alter their destinations, in an increasingly intensively 
  used world the probability of finding sufficient areas of suitable habitat in 
  the new areas is small. The current system of protected habitats under the Ramsar 
  Convention is based on the present distribution of climate.</p>
<h4>10.2.3.3.3. Locust migrations<a name="102333"></a></h4>
<p>Aperiodic locust outbreaks characterize the desert/semi-arid fringe in southern 
  Africa and the Sahelian region. The population biology of the outbreak phenomenon 
  is strongly linked to climate, particularly the pattern of soil moisture and 
  temperature (Hanrahan <i>et al., </i>1992). Outbreaks typically occur when a 
  dry period is followed by good rains&#151;for instance, in southern Africa following 
  an El Ni&ntilde;o episode. Changes in El Ni&ntilde;o frequency would impact 
  the timing, location, and extent of locust outbreaks in ways that presently 
  are unpredictable.</p>
<h4>10.2.3.3.4. Human migratory systems<a name="102334"></a></h4>
<p>Semi-arid areas of the Sahel, the Kalahari, and the Karoo historically have 
  supported nomadic societies that respond to intra-annual rainfall seasonality 
  and large interannual variability through migration. Nomadic pastoral systems 
  are intrinsically quite robust to fluctuating and extreme climates (because 
  that is what they evolved to cope with), provided they have sufficient scope 
  for movement and other necessary elements in the system remain in place. The 
  prolonged drying trend in the Sahel since the 1970s has demonstrated the vulnerability 
  of such groups to climate change when they cannot simply move their axis of 
  migration because the wetter end already is densely occupied and permanent water 
  points fail at the drier end. The result has been widespread loss of human life 
  and livestock and substantial changes to the social system.</p>
