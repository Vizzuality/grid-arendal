<h2>2.7. Decision Analytic Methods and Frameworks</h2>
<p>This section presents basic principles of decision analytic frameworks that 
  have been or could be used in assessing adaptation decisions in sectors and 
  regions. Thus, it provides a common base for decision analysis-related discussions 
  in sectoral and regional chapters of this report.</p>
<h3><a name="271"></a>2.7.1. Decision Analysis to Support Adaptive Decisions&#151;Introduction 
  to Frameworks and Principles</h3>
<p>Decisionmakers who are responsible for climate-sensitive economic sectors (e.g., 
  forestry, agriculture, health care, water supply) or environmental assets (e.g., 
  nature reserves) face questions related to undertaking adaptation measures on 
  the basis of what impacts might be expected if global GHG emissions continue 
  unabated or as a result of globally agreed mitigation action at different levels 
  of control. The starting point for adaptation decisions is to explore the possible 
  range of impacts to which one would need to adapt. This is a complex task in 
  itself because it involves understanding possible regional patterns of climate 
  change, the evolution of key socioeconomic and biophysical components of the 
  sector or region under consideration, and the dynamics of the impacts of changing 
  climatic conditions on the evolving social system.</p>
<p>Adaptation decisions in private sectors operating under free-market conditions 
  will be made largely as part of a business-as-usual approach and will rely on 
  analytical frameworks that are compatible with the management culture. The emerging 
  literature on adaptation describes this as autonomous adaptation. The flexibility 
  of private-sector actors and thus the range of options they are able to consider 
  in adapting to any external impact (not only climatic ones) can be severely 
  constrained by market distortions or by a lack of resources to implement any 
  transformation. Under such circumstances, the potential for autonomous adaptation 
  is limited. Planned adaptation will be required, and the importance of public 
  policy is larger.</p>
<p>A standard example for autonomous adaptation is the farmer who switches from 
  one cultivar of a given crop to another or from one crop to another in response 
  to perceived changes in weather patterns, simultaneously considering changes 
  in relative prices of input factors and agricultural commodities, the evolving 
  technological and agronomic conditions behind them, and other factors affecting 
  his profits. However, if prices are distorted by a quota system or state subsidy, 
  decisions are excessively dominated by these considerations, which could lead 
  to maladaptation. Similarly, subsistence farmers in less-developed countries 
  are not profit maximizers, and they may not possess the resources required to 
  make even minor shifts in response to changes in their external conditions. 
  Under these conditions, the only possibility for them might be to give up their 
  livelihood altogether.</p>
<p>With a view to the already significant atmospheric load of GHGs since the industrial 
  revolution, as well as the huge inertia and long delays characterizing the atmosphere-ocean-biosphere 
  system, adaptation to anthropogenic climate change appears inevitable over the 
  coming decades. It is worth looking at some of the key differences in applications 
  of DAFs that deal with climate change mitigation (reducing GHG emissions) and 
  adaptation (managing and counterbalancing the impacts of climate change).</p>
<p>The most crucial difference between mitigation- and adaptation-oriented DAF 
  applications is to whom the benefits of action accrue. Except for "no-regret" 
  options, benefits of mitigation will become a globally shared public good. Adaptation 
  actions will predominantly benefit agents who adapt, in the case of private 
  actors, or gains will be shared by the community in the case of local/regional 
  public goods and services, such as flood protection.</p>
<p>The second important difference between mitigation and adaptation decisions 
  is related to the timing of policy options. If climate protection were needed, 
  as many scientists and policymakers maintain, policies and technologies that 
  help reduce GHG emissions at the lowest possible social costs would be required 
  immediately. On the adaptation side, in contrast, the bulk of more significant 
  impacts of climate change may be felt 30, 50, or 100 years from now. This leaves 
  a longer time period (compared to mitigation action) to steer the development 
  of climate-sensitive sectors so that their climate vulnerability will be lower 
  and, more important, to develop technologies that will help reduce remaining 
  negative impacts by the time they really happen. Nevertheless, forethought and 
  action might well be required in sectors with long-lived infrastructure and 
  large social inertia (e.g., changing institutions such as misallocated property 
  rights) to foster adaptation to future climate.</p>
<p>In terms of public policies, the foregoing analysis implies urgency on the 
  mitigation side to formulate and put in place appropriate measures; by contrast, 
  in general there is more time on the adaptation side to sort out potential impacts, 
  adaptation needs, institutional and technological options involved in various 
  adaptation measures, and public policies to develop and deliver them. At the 
  same time, however, in many countries around the world that suffer from current 
  climatic variability and extremes, there is an urgent need for appropriate adaptation 
  policies and programs to be designed and implemented now to lessen adverse impacts; 
  such actions also will help to build adaptive capacity for future climate changes.</p>
<p>Several other differences between mitigation and adaptation decisions must 
  be considered in framing DAFs appropriately. Mitigation decisions are to be 
  crafted globally, and their implementation may entail a global spread to reduce 
  costs, whereas adaptation decisions are more limited to nations or subnational 
  regions. The region in this context is intentionally defined loosely and given 
  a broad interpretation. In considering climate change impacts and adaptation 
  policies, a region typically would be a sociogeographical unit under the jurisdiction 
  of a legally recognized policy entity within a country. However, a region in 
  this sense also could correspond to a whole country, especially if it is relatively 
  small and geographically homogeneous. Moreover, regional climate impact and 
  adaptation studies also are conceivable (and in some cases have been undertaken) 
  at the level of a supranational region, provided it has a recognized policymaking 
  entity (e.g., the European Union).</p>
<p>Many market-sector impacts can be relieved at least partially by a combination 
  of regional adjustments and interregional trade (especially in the agriculture 
  and livestock sectors), but regions remain the prime focus of adaptation policies 
  even in these cases. In terms of the public policy agenda, mitigation decisions 
  have to be made today in the context of current short-term economic problems, 
  social challenges, and policy debates. Adaptation and adaptation-related analyses 
  will have to be developed in the context of long-term socioeconomic and technological 
  development, with a special view to economic and technological trends in climate-sensitive 
  economic sectors and environmental systems. This makes adaptation-oriented DAF 
  applications easier because options to factor them in are much broader, but 
  it also makes them more difficult because the future is difficult to predict 
  and there is a clear need for policies that will be successful across a broad 
  range of plausible futures (these policies commonly are called robust). The 
  information base for adaptation decisions will improve over time, whereas DAFs 
  to support near-term mitigation decisions must cope with current knowledge plagued 
  with enormous uncertainties.</p>
