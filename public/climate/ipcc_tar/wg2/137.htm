<h3>3.4.3. Scenarios of Acidifying Compounds</h3>
<h4><a name="3431"></a>3.4.3.1. Reference Conditions</h4>
<p>Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen compounds are among the major air pollutants emitted 
  by industrial and domestic sources. SO<sub>2</sub> is further oxidized to sulfate, 
  which exists in the atmosphere mainly as aerosols. The main anthropogenic components 
  of emissions of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere are NO<sub>x</sub> and 
  ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). Increased atmospheric SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  from anthropogenic sources are known to have negative effects on tree growth 
  and crop yield (Kropff, 1989; Semenov <i>et al</i>., 1998) and are described 
  below. Concentrations of nitrogen compounds are not considered because scenarios 
  seldom are required for impact studies. However, wet and dry deposition of sulfur 
  and nitrogen from the atmosphere onto the Earth's surface can lead to acidification, 
  with detrimental effects on soils, surface waters, building materials, and ecosystems 
  (Grennfelt <i>et al</i>., 1996). Nitrogen deposition may serve simultaneously 
  as a plant fertilizer, positively influencing carbon gain in forests (Reich 
  <i>et al</i>., 1990; Woodward, 1992; Petterson <i>et al</i>., 1993). Thus, deposition 
  scenarios also are important.</p>
<p>Current global background concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> are monitored at 
  stations belonging to the Background Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring Network 
  (BAPMoN), established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UNEP, 
  as well as in regional networks. Annual mean SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations ([SO<sub>2</sub>]) 
  over land areas are estimated to be approximately 0.1-10 mg m<small><sup>-3</sup></small> 
  (Rovinsky and Yegorov, 1986; Ryaboshapko <i>et al</i>., 1998). However, they 
  can be much higher locally (<a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>). For example, 
  annual average values of more than 80 mg m<small><sup>-3</sup></small> were 
  measured at some sites in Czechoslovakia in the 1970s (Materna, 1981). Model 
  results have shown that [SO2] averaged over the vegetative season reached 35 
  mg m<small><sup>-3</sup></small> in some regions of Europe during 1987-1993 
  (Semenov <i>et al</i>., 1998, 1999). In recent years reductions of SO<sub>2</sub> 
  and NO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been recorded in many regions, accompanied 
  by large-scale decreases in concentrations, especially evident in remote areas 
  (Whelpdale and Kaiser, 1997). Typical rates of regional total (dry + wet) deposition 
  of sulfur and nitrogen compounds, based on model simulations, are shown in <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 
  3-2</a>.</p>
<p>Reference concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> adopted in impact assessments vary 
  according to the objective of the study. For example, in some field experiments 
  an enhanced [SO<sub>2</sub>] treatment is compared to a control case at ambient 
  background concentrations. The latter concentrations can vary from year to year, 
  depending on ambient weather and air quality conditions (Kropff, 1989). Alternatively, 
  other experiments at locations close to pollution sources have used air purification 
  systems to attain preindustrial levels of [SO<sub>2</sub>] in closed chambers, 
  comparing plant responses to those under (locally high) ambient concentrations. 
</p>
<h4><a name="3432"></a>3.4.3.2. Development and Application of Sulfur and Nitrogen 
  Scenarios</h4>
<p>Several models have been developed to project atmospheric concentrations and 
  deposition of sulfur and (in some cases) nitrogen compounds. At the regional 
  scale these models include: for Europe, RAINS (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1990; Sch&ouml;pp 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999) and ASAM (ApSimon <i>et al</i>., 1994), both of which use 
  output from mechanistic models developed by the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring 
  and Evaluation of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP); 
  for Asia, RAINS-Asia (Foell <i>et al</i>., 1995); and for North America and 
  Asia, ATMOS (Arndt <i>et al</i>., 1997). There also are global models: GRANTOUR 
  (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1994), MOGUNTIA (Langner and Rodhe, 1991), ECHAM (Feichter 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996), and STOCHEM (Collins <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>There have been few studies of the joint impacts of acidifying compounds and 
  climate change. Some of these studies are multifactorial model simulations of 
  plant response (e.g., Semenov <i>et al</i>., 1998). There also have been some 
  modeling studies based on the IS92a emissions scenario (Posch <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; Fischer and Rosenzweig, 1996), under which a substantial increase in annual 
  sulfur deposition is projected to occur by 2050, with commensurate suppression 
  of modeled GHG warming in some regions. However, this scenario is now thought 
  to overestimate future emissions of sulfur (Gr&uuml;bler, 1998), as reflected 
  in the new SRES scenarios (see <a href="154.htm#381">Section 3.8.1</a>). Not 
  all of the models used in developing the SRES scenarios provide information 
  on nitrogen emissions, but those that do can be used to produce consistent scenarios 
  of [NO<sub>x</sub>], [SO<sub>2</sub>], sulfur and nitrogen deposition, and climate 
  change for impact studies (Mayerhofer <i>et al</i>., 2000; Stevenson <i>et al</i>., 
  2000; see <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>).</p>
