<h6><a name="1524122"></a>15.2.4.1.2.2. Floods</h6>
<p>Floods also may become more frequent (see <a href="557.htm">Section 15.2.1.3</a>). 
  All rivers are susceptible to flooding, and nearby populations are potentially 
  vulnerable. In the United States, floods are the most frequent natural disaster, 
  as well as the leading cause of death from natural disasters. The mean annual 
  loss of life is estimated to be 146 deaths yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small> (National 
  Weather Service, 1992; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). In 1997, the Canadian Red 
  River flood displaced more than 25,000 people (Francis and Hengeveld, 1998; 
  Manitoba Water Commission, 1998). </p>
<p>During a flood, disaster relief workers may be at risk of injury. For example, 
  119 injuries were identified from medical claims of people engaged in sandbagging 
  activities in the 1993 Midwest floods. Heat-related injury or illness (HRI), 
  which occurs when the body can no longer maintain a healthy core temperature, 
  was the most frequently reported injury diagnosis; a total of 23 HRI (19.3% 
  of the 119 total injuries) were reported (Dellinger <i>et al</i>., 1996). HRI 
  therefore is a potential problem in disaster relief situations, particularly 
  if high ambient temperature and high humidity exist. Following a flood, flood 
  victims may be at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, 
  which are risk factors for suicide. Krug <i>et al</i>. (1998) showed that suicide 
  rates increased from 12.1 to 13.8 per 100,000 population in the 4 years after 
  floods. Inundations of sites that contain toxic wastes, sewage, animal wastes, 
  or agrochemical products may result in immediate human exposure to wastes from 
  floodwaters, contamination of edible fish, and long-term contamination of flooded 
  living structures (see Sections <a href="557.htm">15.2.1.3</a> and <a href="571.htm#1524222">15.2.4.2.2.2</a>).</p>
<h6><a name="1524123"></a>15.2.4.1.2.3. Hurricanes </h6>
<p>Climate models currently are unable to project accurately how hurricanes will 
  change in the future. Today, an average of two hurricanes make landfall each 
  year along the coastline of the continental United States (Hebert <i>et al</i>., 
  1993). There has been considerable interdecadal variability in the number of 
  landfalling hurricanes in the United States (Pielke and Pielke, 1997). The Federal 
  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared fewer than 20 natural disasters 
  annually in the 1950s and 1960s but more than 40 yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small> 
  in the 1990s (Miller <i>et al</i>., 2000). Hurricanes' strong winds and 
  heavy rains cause injury, death, and psychological disorders (Logue <i>et al</i>., 
  1979; Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000). A total of 20-30% of adults who lived 
  through Hurricane Andrew showed evidence of PTSD at 6 months and 2 years after 
  the event (Norris <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<h6><a name="1524124"></a>15.2.4.1.2.4. Ice Storms</h6>
<p>Milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms but could cause an 
  increase in freezing rain if average daily temperatures fluctuate about the 
  freezing point. It is difficult to predict where ice storms will occur and identify 
  vulnerable populations. The ice storm of January 1998 (see <a href="585.htm#15326">Section 
  15.3.2.6</a>) left 45 people dead and nearly 5 million people without heat or 
  electricity in Ontario, Quebec, and New York (CDC, 1998; Francis and Hengeveld, 
  1998; Kerry <i>et al</i>., 1999). The storm had a huge impact on medical services 
  and human health. Doctors' offices were forced to close, and a large number 
  of surgeries were cancelled (Blair, 1998; Hamilton, 1998). One urban emergency 
  department reported 327 injuries resulting from falls in a group of 257 patients 
  (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1998b).</p>
<h6><a name="1524125"></a>15.2.4.1.2.5. Tornadoes</h6>
<p> Although some evidence is available regarding increases in the intensity and 
  frequency of some extreme weather events, it is not yet clear how tornadoes 
  will be affected. The tornado of July 31, 1987, in Edmonton, Alberta, killed 
  27 people and injured 253 (Etkin <i>et al</i>., 1998). Trends in the United 
  States appear to show a decreasing number of deaths since the 1950s, although 
  data on the number of events causing deaths do not show a trend (Kunkel <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999). Godleski (1997) reports that persons who endure tornadoes often 
  experience a variety of stress responses, including depression, acute and post-traumatic 
  stress disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, and somatization.</p>
