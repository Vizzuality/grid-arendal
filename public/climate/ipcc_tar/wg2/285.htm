<h2><a name="61"></a>6.1. Introduction and Scope </h2>
<p>The oceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and play a vital role in the 
  global environment. They regulate the Earth's climate and modulate global 
  biogeochemical cycles. They are of significant socioeconomic value as suppliers 
  of resources and products worth trillions of dollars each year (IPCC, 1998). 
  Oceans function as areas of recreation and tourism, as a medium for transportation, 
  as a repository of genetic and biological information, and as sinks for wastes. 
  These functions are shared by the coastal margins of the oceans.</p>
<p>Approximately 20% of the world's human population live within 30 km of 
  the sea, and nearly double that number live within the nearest 100 km of the 
  coast (Cohen <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Gommes <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Nicholls and Mimura (1998) 
  have estimated that 600 million people will occupy coastal floodplain land below 
  the 1,000-year flood level by 2100.</p>
<p>Any changes associated with global warming should be considered against the 
  background of natural variations, such as long-term variations caused by solar 
  and tectonic factors, as well as short- and mid-term changes related to atmospheric 
  and oceanic conditions. Climate change will affect the physical, biological, 
  and biogeochemical characteristics of the oceans and coasts at different time 
  and space scales, modifying their ecological structure and functions. These 
  changes, in turn, will exert significant feedback on the climate system. The 
  world's oceans already are under stress as a result of a combination of 
  factors&#151;such as increased population pressure in coastal areas, habitat 
  destruction, and increased pollution from the atmosphere, from land-based sources, 
  and from river inputs of nutrients and other contaminants (Izrael and Tsyban, 
  1983). These factors, along with increased UV-B radiation resulting from stratospheric 
  ozone depletion, are expected to impair the resilience of some marine ecosystems 
  to climate change. </p>
<p>This chapter reviews the potential impacts of climate change on the coastal 
  zone, marine ecosystems, and marine fisheries. It provides an assessment of 
  the latest scientific information on impacts and adaptation strategies that 
  can be used to anticipate and reduce these impacts. Emphasis is placed on scientific 
  work completed since 1995. This chapter builds on earlier IPCC reports but differs 
  in several significant ways. First, the content of the present chapter was covered 
  in three separate chapters in the Second Assessment Report (SAR: Chapter 8, 
  Oceans; Chapter 9, Coastal Zones and Small Islands; Chapter 16, Fisheries) and 
  in two chapters in the First Assessment Report (FAR: World Oceans and Coastal 
  Zones, Working Group II; Coastal Zone Management, Working Group III). Second, 
  in the Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (IPCC, 1998), impacts 
  on the oceans and coasts were considered in each of the regional chapters; those 
  on the Small Island States and the Arctic and Antarctic were of particular relevance 
  to the present chapter. Third, whereas previous IPCC reports highlighted sea-level 
  rise, vulnerability assessment, biogeophysical effects, and single-sector impacts, 
  this chapter covers several other topics&#151;including a range of methodologies; 
  climate-change parameters; physical, biological, and socioeconomic sensitivities; 
  and adaptation mechanisms. Additional and regionally specific coastal and marine 
  details are included in the regional chapters of this Third Assessment Report 
  (TAR).</p>
