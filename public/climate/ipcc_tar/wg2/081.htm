<h3>2.3.2. What are the Appropriate Scales of Analysis for Impact Assessments?</h3>
<p>Climate change impact assessments must begin with decisions about the scope 
  and scale of the assessment: What are the main policy issues? What and who are 
  exposed to climate change impacts? What is the appropriate scale&#151;time frame, 
  geographical extent, and resolution? Considerable progress has been achieved 
  since the SAR in raising such framing questions at the outset of an assessment 
  cycle, often in conjunction with representative stakeholders (see Carter <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994; Downing <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Methods for identifying policy issues include checklists and inventories, document 
  analysis, surveys and interviews, and simulations. The process of determining 
  the scope of assessment should be iterative. The project design should specify 
  what and who is exposed to climate change impacts&#151;economic sectors, firms, 
  or individuals. Evaluation of adaptation strategies should be cognizant of actors 
  involved in making decisions or suffering consequences.</p>
<p>The choice of temporal scales, regional extent, and resolution should be related 
  to the focus of the assessment. Often, more than one scale is required, under 
  methods such as strategic scale cycling (Root and Schneider, 1995) or multi-level 
  modeling (e.g., Easterling <i>et al</i>., 1998). Linkage to global assessments 
  may be necessary to understand the policy and economic context (e.g., Darwin 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>The most common set of methods and tools remains various forms of dynamic simulation 
  modeling, such as crop-climate models or global vegetation dynamic models. A 
  major improvement in impact modeling has been applicaton of process-oriented 
  models, often with geographically explicit representations, instead of models 
  that are based on correlations of climatic limits. Data for running and validating 
  models is a recurrent issue. Intermodel comparisons have been undertaken in 
  some areas (e.g., Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1999), but much remains to be done.</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to have multiple impacts across sectors and synergistic 
  effects with other socioeconomic and environmental stresses, such as desertification, 
  water scarcity, and economic restructuring. Most studies (especially as reported 
  in the SAR) have focused on single-sector impacts. Relatively few studies have 
  attempted to integrate regionally or even identified segments of the population 
  that are most at risk from climate change. </p>
<p>Vulnerability assessment may be one way of integrating the various stresses 
  on populations and regions arising from climate change (see Briguglio, 1995; 
  Clark <i>et a</i>l., 1998; Huq et al., 1999; Kaly <i>et al</i>., 1999; Mimura 
  et al., 2000; Downing <i>et al</i>., 2001). There are some areas in which formal 
  methods for vulnerability assessment have been well developed (e.g., famine 
  monitoring and food security, human health) and applied to climate change. However, 
  methods and tools for evaluating vulnerability are in formative stages of development.</p>
<p>Further development of methods and tools for vulnerability assessment appears 
  warranted, especially for the human dimensions of vulnerability, integration 
  of biophysical and socioeconomic impacts, and comparison of regional vulnerability. 
  Conceptual models and applications of the evolution of vulnerability on the 
  time scale of climate change are required. Formal methods of choosing indicators 
  and combining them into meaningful composite indices must be tested. Combining 
  qualitative insight and quantitative information is difficult but essential 
  to full assessments. Finally, improved methods and tools should facilitate comparison 
  of vulnerability profiles between at-risk regions and populations and highlight 
  potential reductions in vulnerability, through policy measures or the beneficial 
  effects of climate change.</p>
