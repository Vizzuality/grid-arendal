<p><a name="fig151"></a>Available evidence suggests that global warming may lead 
  to substantial changes in mean annual streamflows, seasonal distributions of 
  flows, and the probabilities of extreme high- or low-flow conditions (Leavesley, 
  1994; Cubasch <i>et al</i>., 1995; Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1995; Trenberth and 
  Shea, 1997). Runoff characteristics may change appreciably over the next several 
  decades, but in the near term, the hydrological effects of global warming are 
  likely to be masked by ongoing year-to-year climatic variability (Rogers, 1994; 
  Miller, 1997; Matalas, 1998). There is some evidence that the intensity of rainfall 
  events may increase under global warming, as a result of increases in the precipitable 
  water content of the atmosphere (IPCC, 1996; Trenberth and Shea, 1997). This 
  may increase flooding risks in some watersheds. Hydrological changes cannot 
  yet be forecast reliably at the watershed scale, although numerous studies have 
  addressed the potential effects of warming scenarios on water availability in 
  North America (e.g., Mortsch and Quinn, 1996; Melack <i>et al</i>., 1997; Moore 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Mulholland <i>et al</i>., 1997; Woodhouse and Overpeck, 
  1998; Wilby <i>et al</i>., 1999; Wolock and McCabe, 2000). <a href="#fig151">Figure 
  15-1</a> summarizes some possible regional hydrological and ecological impacts 
  of climate change identified in recent analyses.<br>
</p>
<p>In general, there is greater confidence in projections of seasonal shifts in 
  runoff and related hydrological characteristics than there is in projections 
  of changes in annual runoff. Regional patterns of precipitation change are highly 
  uncertain. Runoff changes also will depend on changes in temperatures and other 
  climatic variables. Warmer temperatures may cause runoff to decline even where 
  precipitation increases (e.g., Nash and Gleick, 1993). Changes in vegetation 
  characteristics will have further, complex impacts on streamflows (Callaway 
  and Currie, 1985; Rosenberg <i>et al</i>., 1990; Riley <i>et al</i>., 1996). 
  Wolock and McCabe (2000) computed annual runoff projections for the 18 major 
  water-resource regions of the continental United States for two GCM scenarios 
  used in the U.S. National Assessment. They found very little agreement between 
  the models&#151;the Canadian Centre for Climate Prediction and Analysis (CCC) 
  model and the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HAD) model&#151;regarding 
  the direction of change in average annual runoff. In addition, most of the projected 
  changes for the next century fell within the range of current variability.<br>
</p>
<p>Projections of shorter snow accumulation periods appear to be more robust. 
  Many studies of snowmelt-dominated systems show similar seasonal shifts to greater 
  winter runoff and reduced summer flow (e.g., Cooley, 1990; Lettenmaier and Gan, 
  1990; Rango and Van Katwijk, 1990; Duell, 1992, 1994; Lettenmaier <i>et al</i>., 
  1992, 1996; Rango, 1995; Melack <i>et al</i>., 1997; Fyfe and Flato, 1999; Wilby 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). In mountainous areas of western North America, small high-elevation 
  catchments may contribute the bulk of the flow of major river systems (Schaake, 
  1990; Redmond, 1998). Although some models predict decreases in snowpack, records 
  from at least one long-term alpine site in the Rocky Mountains show an increase 
  in annual precipitation since 1951 (Williams <i>et al</i>., 1996). Earlier melt-off 
  in combination with either lower or higher snowpack will tend to increase winter 
  or spring flows and reduce summer flows. Warmer temperatures could increase 
  the number of rain-on-snow events in some river basins, increasing the risk 
  of winter and spring floods (Lettenmaier and Gan, 1990; Hughes <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Loukas and Quick, 1996). Lower summer flows, warmer summer water temperatures, 
  and increased winter flows are results on which many of the regional ecological 
  impacts identified in <a href="#fig151">Figure 15-1</a> are based.</p>
<p>Studies based on climate change scenarios from older versions of GCMs that 
  did not include aerosol effects suggest reductions in streamflow and lake levels 
  in many Canadian watersheds, despite scenario increases in annual precipitation 
  (Hofmann <i>et al</i>., 1998). Bruce <i>et al</i>. (2000) examined a variety 
  of newer evidence, including temperature and precipitation changes projected 
  by transient runs of seven different atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) with business-as-usual 
  greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol increases. They conclude that many areas of 
  Canada, including southwestern Canada and the Great Lakes region, could experience 
  "&#133;reduced total flow, lower minimum flows and lower average annual 
  peak flow" (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Open-water evaporation is an important part of the water balance of the North 
  American Great Lakes. Increased evaporation as a result of warmer water temperatures 
  therefore would likely affect future lake levels and outflow into the St. Lawrence 
  River (Mortsch and Quinn, 1996; Mortsch <i>et al</i>., 2000). Most analyses 
  for the Great Lakes suggest declines in lake levels and outflows (Mortsch and 
  Quinn, 1996; Chao, 1999). Chao (1999), for example, examined 10 different transient 
  GCM scenarios (without aerosols) for IPCC decades 2 and 3 and concludes, "In 
  general the decrease in inflows under all the GCM scenarios result in negative 
  impacts to hydropower, navigation and coldwater habitat, and positive ones to 
  shoreline damages." Mortsch <i>et al</i>. (2000) compared such early results 
  to results based on transient runs of the CCC model and the HadCM2 model, both 
  of which include aerosol impacts. Whereas the CCC model run suggests declines 
  in lake levels and outflows comparable to the earlier doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  runs (e.g., a 1.01-m decline in the level of Lakes Michigan and Huron by 2050), 
  the HadCM2 model indicates the possibility of a small rise in lake levels and 
  outflows (0.03-m rise in Lakes Michigan and Huron by 2050). Caution is required 
  in interpreting these results because there is substantial uncertainty regarding 
  future sulfate emissions, and projections of aerosol concentrations have declined 
  considerably since these runs were performed (Carter <i>et al</i>., 2000). </p>
<p>Arid environments are characterized by highly nonlinear relationships between 
  precipitation and runoff. Thus, streamflows in the arid and semi-arid western 
  portions of North America will be particularly sensitive to any changes in temperature 
  and precipitation (Schaake, 1990; Arnell <i>et al</i>., 1996; Kaczmarek <i>et 
  al</i>., 1996). Rivers that originate in mountainous regions will be particularly 
  sensitive to winter precipitation in the headwaters, regardless of conditions 
  in the downstream semi-arid zone (e.g., Cohen, 1991). In addition, "&#133;severe 
  flood events may be more damaging in drier climates where soils are more erodible&#133;" 
  (Arnell <i>et al</i>., 1996).<br>
</p>
<p>Little research attention has been given to the possible impacts of climate 
  change on sediment transport and deposition, which could affect aquatic ecosystems, 
  reservoir storage capacity, potential flood damages, and the need for dredging 
  operations. However, projected increases in the intensity of precipitation events 
  could contribute to increased erosion and sedimentation in some areas (Mount, 
  1995).</p>
