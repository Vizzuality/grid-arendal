<h3>10.4.4. Future Needs </h3>
<p>Issues related to Africa's capacity to understand projected impacts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Data Needs:</i> The potential exists to develop environmental information 
    systems on the basis of satellite data products and geographic information 
    systems at small management units such as river basins, with socioeconomic 
    and biophysical attributes as required in analyses of impacts and management. 
    Current impact assessment models are limited by input data, limiting their 
    use to fairly general questions. Examples exist where detailed spatial databases 
    have been built and are being used to run integrated agrohydrological models, 
    such as in South Africa (Schulze, 1997; Schulze and Perks, 2000). Monitoring 
    of environmental processes as well as increased weather observation are required. 
    Coordinated collection of integrated data sets for subregions or in connection 
    with an extreme event such as a drought or a flood is highly desirable and 
    would contribute to understanding of adaptation and response strategies and 
    regional integrated modeling.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Human Capacity:</i> There is great need for increased African capacity 
    to study the more fundamental science issues of global change and its impacts. 
    There is great capacity at the applied management level in Africa, and this 
    must be strengthened by a strong science capacity. The increasing number of 
    international environmental treaties and agreements will require an even greater 
    capacity for analysis and delivery of timely reports. There also is great 
    need to apply science findings in policy analysis and international negotiations. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Integrated Analysis:</i> It is becoming increasingly clear that most 
    environmental problems such as climate change require integration of many 
    disciplines and methods of analysis. There also is a shift in interest and 
    focus from global scales to regional and local scales. Models that help to 
    integrate science findings with management and policy issues are needed. These 
    models, called integrated assessment models, are required at regional and 
    subregional levels and should include all important linkages between the socioecological 
    and economic sectors. Given the unique combinations of factors in subregions 
    of Africa (climate, economics, infrastructure), it will be necessary in future 
    assessments to develop and apply regional assessment models that reflect key 
    factors for each subregion, and these models will need to be built around 
    issues of sustainable development rather than emissions reduction. Linking 
    climate change (and other environmental issues) to sustainable development 
    is not going to be easy, but it should spawn a rich body of research to define 
    methods and approaches that will work.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Literature Written in French:</i> It is recognized that there is a rich 
    body of literature that is written in French, and although efforts were made 
    to capture these studies, it simply was not possible to conduct an exhaustive 
    synthesis of that body of work. This represents a major challenge for Africa-wide 
    assessments.</li>
</ul>
