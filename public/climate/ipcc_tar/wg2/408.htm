<h3>10.4.3. Cross-Cutting Issues</h3>
<h4><a name="10431"></a>10.4.3.1. Costing</h4>
<p>In some of the sectors affected by climate change&#151;such as water resources, 
  food security, and natural resources&#151;it may be possible to attach financial 
  values. At this point, there are few if any published data on the economic impacts 
  of climate change on these sectors in Africa. However, there are indications 
  of what it costs to support communities that have been affected by famine and 
  floods. Because most of this is foreign aid, it is difficult to evaluate costs 
  in relation to individual country economies. There are indications that water 
  shortages have a negative impact on power generation and consequently economic 
  activities. It is acknowledged that some elements such as health are difficult 
  to cost. Nevertheless, the financial impacts of dealing with epidemics such 
  as malaria, menengitis, and cholera are known by various governments. Governments 
  may be able to translate the impacts described in this assessment to national 
  costs and begin to plan how to develop adaptive financial measures. As methods 
  for impact assessment involve more integrated modeling, it will be possible 
  to quantify impacts of specific climate change scenarios, either in terms of 
  goods and services or in monetary terms. </p>
<h4><a name="10432"></a>10.4.3.2. Development, Sustainability, and Equity</h4>
<p>The great uncertainty is the political development of Africa. Africa has had 
  its share of surprises in the political arena. What appeared to be a steady 
  march to economic growth would be shattered by sudden political upheavals and 
  festering corruption among national leadership, which tends to have a trickle-down 
  effect until the process of governance is corrupted at its core. On the other 
  hand, the sudden collapse of apartheid in South Africa brought a fresh wind 
  of hope in southern Africa, with far-reaching impacts on the rest of the continent. 
  The adaptive recommendations made in this assessment assume an underpinning 
  of good governance and social responsibility. Achebe <i>et al.</i> (1990) tackle 
  the issue of Africa's future political and economic demise. Using various 
  approaches and assumptions, they conclude that Africa may not enjoy political 
  and economic stability prior to 2020-2030 at the earliest. According to 
  climate change impact scenarios, this is the period when climate impacts will 
  have significant impacts on the economic and social fabric. Thus, the message 
  is that Africa must get its house in order as a matter of urgency. We challenge 
  the African political leadership to belie the Achebe<i> et al.</i> (1990) prognosis.</p>
<p>The impacts of climate change are expected to be severe, yet Africa's 
  contribution to climate change through emissions is minimal. There are strong 
  feelings among some people in the South who would like to see the North implement 
  tangible emissions reductions and find ways of helping the South adapt to adverse 
  impacts of climate change. From this synthesis, it is clear that Africa is highly 
  vulnerable, with very low capacity to adapt. There is great potential to transfer 
  technology to Africa that would help in developing sustainable agriculture, 
  as well as other technologies that would assist in improving welfare and economic 
  development.</p>
<p>Although the relative importance of climatic and anthropogenic factors in causing 
  desertification remains unresolved, evidence shows that certain arid, semi-arid, 
  and dry subhumid areas have experienced declines in rainfall, resulting in decreases 
  in soil fertility and agricultural, livestock, forest, and rangeland production. 
  Ultimately, these adverse impacts lead to political and socioeconomic instability.</p>
<p>Given the range and magnitude of development constraints and challenges facing 
  most African nations, the overall capacity for Africa to adapt to climate change 
  is low. Although there is uncertainty about what the future holds, Africa must 
  start planning now to adapt to climate change. National environmental action 
  plans and their implementation need to incorporate long-term changes and pursue 
  "no regret" strategies. Current technologies and approaches&#151;especially 
  in agriculture and water&#151;are unlikely to be adequate to meet projected 
  demands, and increased climate variability will be an additional stress. Seasonal 
  forecasting&#151;for example, linking SST to outbreaks of diseases&#151;is a 
  promising adaptive strategy that will help to save lives.</p>
<p>Climate change offers some opportunities for development. The process of adapting 
  to global climate change, including technology transfer, offers new development 
  pathways that could take advantage of Africa's resources and human potential. 
  Examples would include competitive agricultural products, resulting from research 
  in new crop varieties and increased international trade, and industrial developments 
  such as solar energy. Regional cooperation in science, resource management, 
  and development already is increasing.</p>
<p>This assessment of vulnerability to climate change is marked by uncertainty. 
  The diversity of African climates, high rainfall variability, and a very sparse 
  observational network make predictions of future climate change difficult at 
  the subregional and local levels. Underlying exposure and vulnerability to climatic 
  changes are well established. Sensitivity to climatic variations is established 
  but incomplete. However, uncertainty about future conditions means that there 
  is low confidence in projected costs of climate change.</p>
