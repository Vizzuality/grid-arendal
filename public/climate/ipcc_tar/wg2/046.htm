<h2>5.6. North America</h2>
<p>North America will experience both positive and negative climate change impacts 
  (high confidence). Varying impacts on ecosystems and human settlements will 
  exacerbate subregional differences in climate-sensitive resource production 
  and vulnerability to extreme events. Opportunities and challenges to adaptation 
  will arise, frequently involving multiple stresses (<a href="#tabts12">Table 
  TS-12</a>). Some innovative adaptation strategies are being tested as a response 
  to current climate-related challenges (e.g., water banks), but few cases have 
  examined how these strategies could be implemented as regional climates continue 
  to change. Shifting patterns in temperature, precipitation, disease vectors, 
  and water availability will require adaptive responses&#151;including, for example, 
  investments in storm protection and water supply infrastructure, as well as 
  community health services. [<a href="582.htm">15.3.2</a>, <a href="590.htm">15.4</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="561"></a>5.6.1. Communities and Urban Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Potential changes in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme events 
  are among the most important risks associated with climate change in North America. 
  Potential impacts of climate change on cities include fewer periods of extreme 
  winter cold; increased frequency of extreme heat; rising sea levels and risk 
  of storm surge; and changes in timing, frequency, and severity of flooding associated 
  with storms and precipitation extremes. These events&#151;particularly increased 
  heat waves and changes in extreme events&#151;will be accompanied by effects 
  on health.</p>
<p>Communities can reduce their vulnerability to adverse impacts through investments 
  in adaptive infrastructure, which can be expensive. Rural, poor, and indigenous 
  communities may not be able to make such investments. Furthermore, infrastructure 
  investment decisions are based on a variety of needs beyond climate change, 
  including population growth and aging of existing systems. [<a href="574.htm">15.2.5</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="562"></a>5.6.2. Water Resources and Aquatic Ecosystems</h3>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="figure"><a href="figts-8.htm"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/images/figts-8s.gif" width="300" height="387" border="0"></a><br>
      <b>Figure TS-8:</b> Possible water resources impacts in North America. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><a name="figts8"></a>Uncertain changes in precipitation lead to little agreement 
  regarding changes in total annual runoff across North America. Modeled impacts 
  of increased temperatures on lake evaporation lead to consistent projections 
  of reduced lake levels and outflows for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system 
  under most scenarios (medium confidence). Increased incidence of heavy precipitation 
  events will result in greater sediment and non-point-source pollutant loadings 
  to watercourses (medium confidence). In addition, in regions where seasonal 
  snowmelt is an important aspect of the annual hydrologic regime (e.g., California, 
  Columbia River Basin), warmer temperatures are likely to result in a seasonal 
  shift in runoff, with a larger proportion of total runoff occurring in winter, 
  together with possible reductions in summer flows (high confidence). This could 
  adversely affect the availability and quality of water for instream and out-of-stream 
  water uses during the summer (medium confidence). <a href="#figts8">Figure TS-8</a> 
  shows possible impacts. [<a href="554.htm">15.2.1</a>]</p>
<p>Adaptive responses to such seasonal runoff changes include altered management 
  of artificial storage capacity, increased reliance on coordinated management 
  of groundwater and surface water supplies, and voluntary water transfers between 
  various water users. Such actions could reduce the impacts of reduced summer 
  flows on water users, but it may be difficult or impossible to offset adverse 
  impacts on many aquatic ecosystems, and it may not be possible to continue to 
  provide current levels of reliability and quality for all water users. Some 
  regions (e.g., the western United States) are likely to see increased market 
  transfers of available water supplies from irrigated agriculture to urban and 
  other relatively highly valued uses. Such reallocations raise social priority 
  questions and entail adjustment costs that will depend on the institutions in 
  place.</p>
<h3><a name="563"></a>5.6.3. Marine Fisheries </h3>
<p>Climate-related variations in marine/coastal environments are now recognized 
  as playing an important role in determining the productivity of several North 
  American fisheries in the Pacific, North Atlantic, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Mexico 
  regions. There are complex links between climatic variations and changes in 
  processes that influence the productivity and spatial distribution of marine 
  fish populations (high confidence), as well as uncertainties linked to future 
  commercial fishing patterns. Recent experience with Pacific salmon and Atlantic 
  cod suggests that sustainable fisheries management will require timely and accurate 
  scientific information on environmental conditions affecting fish stocks, as 
  well as institutional and operational flexibility to respond quickly to such 
  information. [<a href="567.htm">15.2.3.3</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="564"></a>5.6.4. Agriculture</h3>
<p>Small to moderate climate change will not imperil food and fiber production 
  (high confidence). There will be strong regional production effects, with some 
  areas suffering significant loss of comparative advantage to other regions (medium 
  confidence). Overall, this results in a small net effect. The agricultural welfare 
  of consumers and producers would increase with modest warming. However, the 
  benefit would decline at an increasing rate&#151;possibly becoming a net loss&#151;with 
  further warming. There is potential for increased drought in the U.S. Great 
  Plains/Canadian Prairies and opportunities for a limited northward shift in 
  production areas in Canada.</p>
<p>Increased production from direct physiological effects of CO<sub>2</sub>, and 
  farm- and agricultural market-level adjustments (e.g., behavioral, economic, 
  and institutional) are projected to offset losses. Economic studies that include 
  farm- and agricultural market-level adjustments indicate that the negative effects 
  of climate change on agriculture probably have been overestimated by studies 
  that do not account for these adjustments (medium confidence). However, the 
  ability of farmers to adapt their input and output choices is difficult to forecast 
  and will depend on market and institutional signals. [<a href="562.htm#15231">15.2.3.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="565"></a>5.6.5. Forests and Protected Areas</h3>
<p>Climate change is expected to increase the areal extent and productivity of 
  forests over the next 50-100 years (medium confidence). However, climate 
  change is likely to cause changes in the nature and extent of several "disturbance 
  factors" (e.g., fire, insect outbreaks) (medium confidence). Extreme or 
  long-term climate change scenarios indicate the possibility of widespread forest 
  decline (low confidence).</p>
<p>There is strong evidence that climate change can lead to the loss of specific 
  ecosystem types&#151;such as high alpine areas and specific coastal (e.g., salt 
  marshes) and inland (e.g., prairie "potholes") wetland types (high confidence). 
  There is moderate potential for adaptation to prevent these losses by planning 
  conservation programs to identify and protect particularly threatened ecosystems. 
  Lands that are managed for timber production are likely to be less susceptible 
  to climate change than unmanaged forests because of the potential for adaptive 
  management. [<a href="558.htm">15.2.2</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="566"></a>5.6.6. Human Health</h3>
<p>Vector-borne diseases, including malaria and dengue fever, may expand their 
  ranges in the United States and may develop in Canada. Tick-borne Lyme disease 
  also may see its range expanded in Canada. However, socioeconomic factors such 
  as public health measures will play a large role in determining the existence 
  or extent of such infections. Diseases associated with water may increase with 
  warming of air and water temperatures, combined with heavy runoff events from 
  agricultural and urban surfaces. Increased frequency of convective storms could 
  lead to more cases of thunderstorm-associated asthma. [<a href="568.htm">15.2.4</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="567"></a>5.6.7. Public and Private Insurance Systems</h3>
<p>Inflation-corrected catastrophe losses have increased eight-fold in North America 
  over the past 3 decades (high confidence). The exposures and surpluses of private 
  insurers (especially property insurers) and reinsurers have been growing, and 
  weather-related profit losses and insolvencies have been observed. Insured losses 
  in North America (59% of the global total) are increasing with affluence and 
  as populations continue to move into vulnerable areas. Insurer vulnerability 
  to these changes varies considerably by region.</p>
<p>Recent extreme events have led to several responses by insurers, including 
  increased attention to building codes and disaster preparedness. Insurers' practices 
  traditionally have been based primarily on historic climatic experience; only 
  recently have they begun to use models to predict future climate-related losses, 
  so the potential for surprise is real. Governments play a key role as insurers 
  or providers of disaster relief, especially in cases in which the private sector 
  deems risks to be uninsurable. [<a href="579.htm">15.2.7</a>]</p>
