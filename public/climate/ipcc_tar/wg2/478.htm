<h3>12.5.8. Sustainability</h3>
<p>Ecological and indeed economic sustainability has become a major issue in Australia 
  and New Zealand (e.g., Moffatt, 1992). Australian government policy has been 
  to integrate sustainability issues within a raft of polices and programs relating 
  national heritage, land care, river care, wetlands, and carbon sequestration 
  (Commonwealth of Australia, 1996). In both countries, land-use change and exotic 
  pests and diseases, notably feral animals, are threatening many native species 
  and ecosystems. In Australia, this is exacerbated by land degradation, notably 
  soil erosion and increasing salinization brought about by loss of vegetative 
  cover and rising water tables resulting from reduced evapotranspiration in catchments 
  and irrigation with inadequate drainage. </p>
<p>These issues have been reviewed in several recent papers and reports, including 
  a paper prepared for the Australian Prime Minister's Science, Engineering 
  and Innovation Council (PMSEIC, 1999). This paper states that continuing degradation 
  is costing Australia dearly in terms of lost production, increased costs of 
  production and rehabilitation, possible damage to a market advantage as a producer 
  of "clean and green" goods, increasing expenditures on building and 
  repairing infrastructure, biodiversity losses, declining air and water quality, 
  and declining aesthetic value of some landscapes.</p>
<p>PMSEIC (1999) states that the Australian community expects the use and management 
  of resources to be economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable, 
  which will require changes in management processes backed by science and engineering 
  innovation. The report emphasizes that individual problems are linked and that 
  an integrated approach is necessary to combat degradation and pursue remediation.</p>
<p>Climate change may exacerbate these problems by increasing opportunities for 
  colonization by exotic species (e.g., woody weeds), by affecting the water balance 
  and water tables, and by increasing erosion rates and flood flows through heavier 
  rain events. Increased fire frequency also may threaten remnant forest and other 
  ecosystems and impact soil degradation.</p>

<h3>12.5.9. Global Markets</h3>
<p>The impacts of climate change on food and fiber production in Australasia will 
  be direct and indirect, the latter through changing global supply and demand 
  influenced by climatic changes in other parts of the globe. Because a large 
  proportion of food and fiber production in both countries is exported, the effect 
  of commodity prices already is a major influence on the areas and mix of plantings 
  and production, as well as profitability (Stafford Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Adaptation 
  in both countries has taken the form of changes in the mix of production between, 
  for example, wool, lamb and beef, dairy products, horticulture and viticulture, 
  and, most recently, farm and plantation forestry, as well as increasing exports 
  of value-added and processed products. Increased variability of production resulting 
  from climate change may restrict expansion of such added-value products. Response 
  to markets has led to rapid changes in some sectors, but this is more difficult 
  for commodities that require longer investment cycles, such as viticulture and 
  forestry. Nevertheless, adaptation to a highly variable environment is a feature 
  of Australian agriculture, and adaptations to climate change also may contribute 
  to exports of agricultural technology. Improved forecasts of commodity prices 
  and longer term trends in supply and demand, taking into account seasonal climate 
  and ENSO forecasts, are a major means of adaptation. This will be especially 
  important for climate change impacts and will require understanding of global 
  effects.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there are implications for future wood flows of scenarios for 
  rates of increased areas of forest plantations. Currently, of the 18 million 
  m<sup>3</sup> log volume harvested annually in New Zealand, one-third is used for domestic 
  consumption and two-thirds is exported. Using a 50,000 ha yr<sup>-1</sup> planting rate, 
  by 2010 the ratio is expected to be 20:80, and by 2025 it is expected to be 
  5:95. Clearly, there is a need for an export focus. If sufficiently large export 
  markets do not materialize for New Zealand, a major alternative use of wood 
  within New Zealand could be for energy, especially if the economics change as 
  a result of external considerations.</p>

<h3>12.5.10. Indigenous Resource Management</h3>
<p>Recognition of indigenous land rights in both countries recently has caused 
  a much greater proportion of both countries to come back under the management 
  control of Aboriginal and Maori peoples (Coombs <i>et al.</i>, 1990; Langton, 1997). 
  In many situations, this has led to less intense economic exploitation, with 
  more varied land use, (e.g., for low-intensity farming and pastoralism, combined 
  with some horticulture, fishing, and ecotourism). Europeans in both countries 
  have much to learn from traditional indigenous knowledge of land management, 
  including the traditional custodianship ethic&#151;particularly with regard 
  to climatic fluctuations, extreme events, and sustainability. Indigenous knowledge 
  may well lead to greater exploitation of indigenous species for nutritional 
  and medicinal purposes. On the other hand, the indigenous people also have much 
  to gain from greater economic and technical expertise related to markets and 
  new technologies and products.</p>
<p>For example, Aboriginal traditional fire management regimes permitted reproduction 
  of fire-dependent floral species and widespread savannas suitable for grazing. 
  Through the creation of buffer zones, these regimes protected fire-intolerant 
  communities such as monsoonal forests (Langton, 2000). Removal of Aboriginal 
  groups into settlements led to areas where wildfires, fueled by accumulated 
  biomass, cause extensive damage. Research in collaboration with traditional 
  Aboriginal owners recently has played a key role in joint management of National 
  Parks where customary Aboriginal burning is promoted to conserve biodiversity. 
</p>
<p>Andersen (1999) looks at the commonly accepted contrast between European ("scientific") 
  and Aboriginal ("experiential") perspectives in fire management and 
  concludes that in fact, European fire managers often lack clear land management 
  goals and are no more "scientific" than Aboriginal fire managers. 
  He argues that the task now is to introduce scientific goals into both European 
  and Aboriginal fire management. This may be particularly applicable in adapting 
  to changing vegetation patterns and increased fire danger in a changing climate.</p>
