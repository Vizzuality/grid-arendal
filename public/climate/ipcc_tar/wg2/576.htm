<h4><a name="15255"></a>15.2.5.5. Development and Vulnerability to Extreme Events</h4>
<p>The cost of natural disasters in North America has increased dramatically since 
  the mid-1980s, in spite of the goal of the International Decade for Natural 
  Disaster Reduction (the 1990s) to reduce the costs of natural disasters by 50% 
  by the year 2000. Although an increase in the number of storms may play a role 
  in these disasters, there is no question that the increasing costs are largely 
  the result of increased vulnerability (Pielke and Downton, 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Natural disasters occur when social vulnerability is triggered by a natural 
  event (see <a href="573.htm#fig153">Figure 15-3</a>). Society responds to a 
  disaster through three overlapping activities: response and recovery, mitigation, 
  and preparedness. These activities alter future vulnerability (and therefore 
  the construct of future disasters)&#151;reducing risk if they are done wisely, 
  or not if they are done otherwise. Often, however, mitigation that is designed 
  to protect against natural hazards increases long-term vulnerability (Burton 
  <i>et al</i>., 1993). An example is the levee system planned for the Grand Forks 
  region, as part of the post-1997 Red River flood mitigation scheme. NHC/DRI 
  (1999) notes, "If the levee system is constructed as planned&#133;[it will] 
  have the potential to greatly increase damage and losses if the levee is breached 
  or overtopped in a future flood."</p>
<p>Superimposed on the changing development landscape is the possibility that 
  climate warming will reduce the risk of some extreme events and increase the 
  risk of others (Karl <i>et al</i>., 1996; White and Etkin, 1997). Changes in 
  the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme events may be among the most 
  important risks associated with climate change. In some parts of North America, 
  this includes fewer periods of extreme cold, fewer snowstorms (although there 
  may be an increase in the number of intense storms), increased spring flooding, 
  more frequent summer droughts, and more wildfires. Studies also suggest that 
  there will be a more thermodynamically unstable atmosphere in the future, which 
  probably will result in more frequent heavy rainfalls and possibly increased 
  hail risk and more tornadoes and downbursts (Etkin, 1996).<br>
</p>
<p>Studies suggest that El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a events may become more 
  frequent in the future, although there is still much uncertainty regarding predictions 
  of tropical phenomena (Henderson-Sellers <i>et al</i>., 1998; Timmermann and 
  Oberhuber, 1999). Any changes would affect the number of extreme events, including 
  the occurrence of Atlantic hurricanes because during El Ni&ntilde;os (La Ni&ntilde;a), 
  Atlantic hurricanes are less (more) frequent. Landsea <i>et al</i>. (1999) point 
  out that recent intensification of urban development along the U.S. Atlantic 
  coast parallels a reduction of hurricane activity from 1966 to the early 1990s; 
  they ask whether the United States is prepared for a recurrence of higher frequencies.<br>
</p>
<p>North American measures of property damage from severe storms are consistently 
  higher and the loss of life lower, compared to less-developed countries. Investments 
  in warning systems and disaster preparedness save lives. When these systems 
  are overwhelmed by extreme events, however, the damage can be catastrophic. 
  It is interesting that housing losses from extreme events generally are on the 
  same scale in North America as those in developing countries, particularly when 
  disaster strikes large urban centers (Comerio, 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Older buildings often experience the greatest damage during extreme events. 
  New buildings, however, also are at risk if insufficient effort is made to ensure 
  compliance with building codes. Studies show that compliance with building codes 
  may have eliminated up to 25% of insured losses resulting from major hurricanes 
  (IBHS, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Damage from flooding in North America has increased in the past few decades 
  (Mileti, 1999). Land-use planning remains a powerful tool to help reduce the 
  loss of life and property. One study that indirectly illustrates this concept 
  is Brown <i>et al</i>. (1997a). They found that nonagricultural flood damage 
  from a set of storms moving through Michigan exceeded that of southwestern Ontario 
  by a factor of about 900, even though the flood yields in Ontario were greater 
  than those in Michigan. Their analysis ascribes the cause as greater development 
  in flood-prone areas. In Michigan, the storms generally exceeded land-use design 
  thresholds, whereas in Ontario they did not.Munich Re (1997) found that "the 
  extent of loss has not infrequently been increased through a false assessment 
  of the risk circumstances or in the pursuit of profit." If the amount of development 
  arising from the perception of reduced short-term risk tends to be disproportionate 
  to the real increased risk from rare events, long-term vulnerability is increased. 
  Mileti (1999) argues that "&#133;our national [U.S.] path also is leading us 
  toward natural and related technological catastrophes in the next millennium 
  that are larger than any we have ever experienced &#133;that is the future we 
  have designed for ourselves.&#133; [We] have done more to postpone losses into 
  the future than to eliminate them." Social and economic trends suggest overall 
  increases in vulnerability; if natural triggers of disasters are exacerbated 
  as a result of climate change, it seems likely that more frequent and severe 
  natural disasters are going to occur in the future (see <a href="579.htm">Section 
  15.2.7</a>).<br clear="all">
