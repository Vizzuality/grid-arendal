<h2>15.1. The North American Region</h2>
<h3><a name="1511"></a>15.1.1. Previous Work</h3>
<p>This chapter offers an assessment for Canada, the United States, and three 
  border regions&#151;the Arctic, U.S.-Mexican, and U.S.-Caribbean borders. More 
  detailed assessments for the Arctic, Mexico, and the Caribbean appear in <a href="592.htm">Chapters 
  16</a>, <a href="516.htm">14</a>, and <a href="619.htm">17</a>, respectively. 
</p>
<p>The IPCC's <i>Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change</i> 
  (IPCC, 1998) provides a review of more than 450 research publications concerned 
  with impacts in North America, generally covering work done during 1975-1997. 
  That review focused on six key sectors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hydrology and water resources.</li>
  <li>Nonforest terrestrial and forested ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Food and fiber, including agriculture, production forestry, and fisheries.</li>
  <li>Coastal systems.</li>
  <li>Human settlements and industry.</li>
  <li>Human health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our update of key regional concerns (see <a href="554.htm">Section 15.2</a>) 
  uses similar categories, with a couple of modifications. First, we consider 
  coastal and marine ecosystems together with terrestrial ecosystems, within the 
  review of natural resources (<a href="558.htm">Section 15.2.2</a>). Second, 
  human settlements are reviewed as a separate category, with extended discussion 
  of infrastructure (<a href="574.htm">Section 15.2.5</a>). Impacts on tourism 
  and insurance are treated separately (Sections <a href="577.htm">15.2.6</a> 
  and <a href="579.htm">15.2.7</a>, respectively). We also include a series of 
  subregional cases that highlight adaptation challenges and opportunities (see 
  <a href="582.htm">Section 15.3</a>).</p>
<p>This categorization of key regional concerns in North America reflects growing 
  interest in higher order impacts. Recent increases in financial losses from 
  extreme weather events (hurricanes, winter storms, floods) have raised new questions 
  about changing frequencies of atmospheric events superimposed on changing development 
  and investment patterns. In the United States, there were 28 such events during 
  the 1980-1997 period with losses exceeding US$1 billion. The most costly 
  were the droughts and heat waves of 1988 and 1990, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, 
  and the 1993 Mississippi River flood, with combined costs exceeding US$100 billion. 
  In Canada, the 1996 Saguenay flood and 1998 ice storm in Ontario and Quebec 
  each cost more than US$0.7 billion (CDN$ 1 billion) (Etkin, 1998). It is important 
  to understand the extent to which these loss trends hinge on changes in climate 
  or changes in vulnerability that may be independent of any changes in climate.</p>
<p>In recent years, the North American nations have undertaken intensive region-specific 
  assessments of impacts and vulnerability (Canada Country Study, U.S. National 
  Assessment, regional case studies). Although some of these assessments are still 
  in progress at this writing, several themes have emerged. The involvement of 
  stakeholders (commercial entities, local and regional governments, natural resource 
  managers, and citizens) has brought new perspectives and refocused the definition 
  of research questions. In nearly all regions, stakeholders perceive changes 
  in variability to be far more threatening than decadal-scale gradual change. 
  Many stakeholders see limited problems in adaptation and possible benefits to 
  slow predictable change. However, there may be appreciable changes in ecosystem 
  distributions and water resources, with significant economic impacts, leading 
  to requirements for substantial changes in infrastructure (e.g., in coastal 
  and permafrost regions, major urban centers). There clearly will be winners 
  and losers.</p>
<p>Overall, available information suggests that if projected levels of climate 
  changes occur, North America will become quite a different place.</p>
<h3><a name="1512"></a>15.1.2. What is Different about the North American Region?</h3>
<p>North America includes economies and resources that might be comparable to 
  those in developed countries and the more developed of the developing countries. 
  Areas within highly urbanized and industrial zones or intensively managed agriculture, 
  forests, and nonrenewable resource extraction all represent large-scale, highly 
  managed resources and human-dominated ecosystems. Within this context, however, 
  there continues to be a great deal of "extensive" land management. 
  Many Canadian and U.S. forests are managed in relatively large tracts compared 
  to other regions and are rather lightly managed aside from harvest schedules. 
  Some are more intensively managed, including post-harvest site preparation for 
  reforestation. <br>
</p>
<p><a href="551.htm#tab151">Table 15-1</a> shows a range of development indicators 
  for Canada and the United States and compares these indicators to Mexico and 
  the rest of the world. Higher levels of resource consumption, urbanization, 
  life expectancy, and gross domestic product (GDP) are obvious, as are the higher 
  rates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. At the same time, the two countries also 
  are unusual in preserving extensive rangelands and other landscapes, so a unique 
  feature is the juxtaposition of intensive management with "extensive" management 
  of huge and sparsely populated areas. Some of these areas remain very much a 
  part of the national economy, but other areas are used for subsistence. Areas 
  that are undeveloped or are under aboriginal land claims that support traditional 
  subsistence lifestyles include features that are found in developing country 
  rural economies. These include low levels of built infrastructure, informal 
  barter systems, close ties to the land, and strong historical and cultural attachments 
  to subsistence-based communities, even in the face of opportunities in the modern 
  wage economy.</p>
<p>In wage and nonwage circumstances, climate change scenarios become scenarios 
  of changing opportunities and risks. Given the multi-objective and multi-stakeholder 
  aspects of North American regions, a climate-related change in potential (e.g., 
  longer growing season, higher fire risk, altered hydrological cycle) may not 
  lead to an immediate, linear response by stakeholders (see <a href="582.htm">Section 
  15.3</a>). An important factor that must be considered is the extent to which 
  individual rights are valued relative to community interests in the management 
  of landscapes. Changing vulnerabilities may occur as a result of coupling of 
  management to current climatic variability (e.g., watersheds developed for hydroelectric 
  production and flood control must continue to adjust to seasonal and yearly 
  variations in natural streamflow, as well as changing management objectives).
