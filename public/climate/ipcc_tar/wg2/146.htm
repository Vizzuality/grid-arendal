<h4>3.5.4.5. Temporal Resolution (Mean versus Variability)<br>
</h4>
<p>For the most part, climate changes calculated from climate model experiments 
  have been mean monthly changes in relevant variables. Techniques for generating 
  changes in variability emerged in the 1990s (Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1992, 1996, 
  1997; Wilks, 1992; Semenov and Barrow, 1997). The most common technique involves 
  manipulation of the parameters of stochastic weather generators to simulate 
  changes in variability on daily to interannual time scales (e.g., Bates <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994, 1996). Several studies have found important differences in the 
  estimated impacts of climate change when effects of variance change were included 
  (Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1997; Semenov and Barrow, 1997). Combined changes in 
  mean and variability also are evident in a broad suite of statistical downscaling 
  methods (Katz and Parlange, 1996; Wilby <i>et al</i>., 1998). Other types of 
  variance change still are difficult to incorporate, such as possible changes 
  in the frequency and intensity of El Ni&ntilde;o events (Trenberth and Hoar, 
  1997). However, where ENSO signals are strong, weather generators can be conditioned 
  on ENSO phases, enabling scenarios of changed ENSO frequency to be generated 
  stochastically (e.g., Woolhiser <i>et al</i>., 1993). However, climate models 
  still are not capable of clearly indicating how ENSO events might change in 
  the future (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="3546"></a>3.5.4.6. Incorporation of Extremes in Scenarios</h4>
<p>Whereas changes in both the mean and higher order statistical moments (e.g., 
  variance) of time series of climate variables affect the frequency of extremes 
  based on these variables (e.g., extreme high daily or monthly temperatures; 
  drought and flood episodes), other types of extremes are based on complex atmospheric 
  phenomena (e.g., hurricanes). Given the importance of the more complex extremes&#151;such 
  as hurricanes, tornadoes, and storm surges (see <a href="061.htm#tab11">Table 
  1-1</a>)&#151;it would be desirable to incorporate changes in the frequency 
  of such phenomena into scenarios. Unfortunately, very little work has been performed 
  on how to accomplish this, and there is only limited information on how the 
  frequency, intensity, and spatial characteristics of such phenomena might change 
  in the future (see <a href="140.htm#tab34">Section 3.8.5</a>). </p>
<p>An example of an attempt to incorporate such changes into impact assessments 
  is the study of McInnes <i>et al</i>. (2000), who developed an empirical/dynamical 
  model that gives return period versus height for tropical cyclone-related storm 
  surges for a location on the north Australian coast. The model can accept changes 
  in tropical cyclone characteristics that may occur as a result of climate change, 
  such as changes in cyclone intensity. Other methods for incorporating such changes 
  into quantitative climate scenarios remain to be developed; further advances 
  in this area of research can be expected over the next few years. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="3547"></a>3.5.4.7. Surprises: Low-Probability, High-Impact Events</h4>
<p>Several types of rapid, nonlinear response of the climate system to anthropogenic 
  forcing, sometimes referred to as "surprises," have been suggested. 
  These include reorganization of the thermohaline circulation, rapid deglaciation, 
  and fast changes to the carbon cycle (e.g., Stocker and Schmittner, 1997). For 
  instance, it has been suggested that a sudden collapse of the thermohaline circulation 
  in the North Atlantic&#151;an event that has not been simulated by any AOGCM 
  (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 9</a>) but cannot be 
  ruled out on theoretical grounds (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>)&#151;could cause major disruptions in regional climate over northwest 
  Europe. Such a possibility has been used to create synthetic arbitrary climate 
  scenarios to investigate possible extreme impacts (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1994; 
  Klein Tank and K&ouml;nnen, 1997).</p>
