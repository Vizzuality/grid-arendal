<h4><b><a name="fig102"></a></b>10.1.3.3. Paleoclimate of Africa </h4>
<p>Paleoclimatology and paleoenvironmental changes in Africa have been reconstructed 
  from several lines of sedimentary evidence, such as fossil strand lines, diatom 
  and pollen analyses, evidence of glaciation and fossil moraines on high mountains, 
  sediment lithology, geochemistry and biogeochemistry, and so forth. Most records 
  do not extend beyond 30,000 years before the present (BP), but they capture 
  the climatic extremes of the last glacial-interglacial cycle&#151;the last glacial 
  maximum (22,000 to 14,000 years BP) through to the Holocene period (10,000 years 
  BP to present) (Olago, 2001).</p>
<p>Temperatures during the last glacial maximum are estimated to have been 4-7&deg;C 
  lower than today, and they were coupled with intensive aridity and regression 
  of lakes throughout the African continent, resulting from reduced precipitation 
  as a consequence of weaker monsoons, stronger dry trade winds, and lowered SST 
  (Coetzee, 1967; Flenley, 1979; COHMAP Members, 1988; Bonnefille <i>et al., </i>1990; 
  Vincens <i>et al.,</i> 1993). Highland vegetation was depressed to significantly 
  lower altitudes relative to today, and mountain glaciers were at their maximum 
  extent. Grasslands were more widespread, lowland forests became fragmented, 
  and subtropical desert margins advanced latitudinally by 300-700 km relative 
  to their present positions (Flohn and Nicholson, 1980).</p>
<p>During the Holocene period of the past 10,000 years there was a "warm" 
  climatic optimum roughly 5,000 years ago. At that time, more humid conditions 
  generally were widespread, and deserts were markedly contracted. Lakes existed 
  even in parts of the central Sahara. The current state of climate was reached 
  roughly 3,000 years ago.</p>
<h4>10.1.3.4. Recent Historical Record<a name="10134"></a></h4>
<p>Observational records show that the continent of Africa is warmer than it was 
  100 years ago (IPCC,1996). Warming through the 20th century has been at the 
  rate of about 0.05&deg;C per decade (see <a href="fig10-2.htm">Figure 10-2</a>), 
  with slightly larger warming in the June, July, August (JJA) and September-November 
  seasons than in December, January, February (DJF) and March-May (Hulme 
  <i>et al., </i>2001). The 5 warmest years in Africa have all occurred since 
  1988, with 1988 and 1995 the two warmest years. This rate of warming is not 
  dissimilar to that experienced globally, and the periods of most rapid warming&#151;the 
  1910s to 1930s and the post-1970s&#151;occur simultaneously in Africa and the 
  world.</p>
<p>The climate of Africa has experienced wetter and drier intervals during the 
  past 2 centuries. The most pronounced periods were during the 20th century. 
  A very intense dry period, much like the current one, also prevailed for 2 to 
  3 decades during the first half of the 19th century. Humid conditions reminiscent 
  of the 1950s prevailed around the 1870s or 1880s, but another milder arid interval 
  of roughly 20 years commenced around 1895.</p>
