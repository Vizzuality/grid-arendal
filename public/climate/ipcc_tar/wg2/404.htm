<h4>10.2.6.5. Impacts of Desertification </h4>
<p>Desertification reduces soil fertility, particularly base cation content, organic 
  matter content, pore space, and water-retention capacity. Desertification also 
  reduces vegetative productivity, leading to long-term declines in agricultural 
  yields, livestock yields, plant standing biomass, and plant biodiversity. These 
  changes reduce the ability of the land to support people, often sparking an 
  exodus of rural people to urban areas. Breaking the strong connection of people 
  to the land produces profound changes in social structure, cultural identity, 
  and political stability.</p>
<p>In Niger, on farmed land where organic carbon in the top 10 cm of the soil 
  has fallen from 0.3 to 0.2% 4 years after coming out of fallow, millet yields 
  fell from 280 to 75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (Bationo <i>et al.,</i> 1993). Modeling 
  of the 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> Mgeni River watershed in South Africa showed that 
  conversion of more than one-quarter of the watershed from forest and rangeland 
  to agriculture and exotic tree plantations since the area was colonized would 
  double mean annual runoff in urban areas and other areas of reduced land cover 
  (Schulze, 2000).</p>
<p>In the Senegal Sahel, the densities of trees with a height of &gt;3 m declined 
  from 10 trees ha<sup>-1</sup> in 1954 to 7.8 trees ha<sup>-1</sup> in 1989; 
  the species richness of trees and shrubs fell from 16 species per 4 km<sup>-2</sup> 
  around 1945 to about 11 per 4 km<sup>-2</sup> in 1993 (Gonzalez, 1997, 2001). 
  These changes have caused a 25-30 km shift of the Sahel, Sudan, and Guinean 
  vegetation zones in half a century, proceeding at an average rate of 500-600 
  m yr<sup>-1</sup>. Arid Sahel species expanded in the northeast, tracking a 
  concomitant retraction of mesic Sudan and Guinean species toward areas of higher 
  rainfall and lower temperature to the southwest.</p>
<p>In the Senegal Sahel, human carrying capacity in 1993 stood at approximately 
  13 people km<sup>-2</sup> at observed patterns of resource use, compared to 
  an actual 1988 rural population density of 45 people km<sup>-2</sup> (Gonzalez, 
  1997, 2001). This means that people with no other alternatives need to cut into 
  their natural resource capital to survive. Such changes across Africa have pushed 
  a rural exodus that may have displaced 3% of the population of Africa since 
  the 1960s (Westing, 1994).</p>
<p>Desertification also will cause conversion of perennial grasslands to savannas 
  dominated by annual grasses. Such changes have occurred in the Kalahari Gemsbok 
  National Park in South Africa, where Landsat imagery showed increases in exposed 
  soil surface (Palmer and van Rooyen, 1998). Such declines often are irreversible 
  (Schlesinger <i>et al., </i>1990).</p>
<h4>10.2.6.6. Vulnerability and Adaptationa<a name="10266"></a></h4>
<p>The tragic death of as many as 250,000 people in the Sahel drought of 1968-1973 
  (UNCOD, 1977) demonstrates the vulnerability of humans to desertification. As 
  desertification proceeds, agricultural and livestock yields decline, reducing 
  people's options for survival. Furthermore, not only do local people lose 
  the vital ecosystem services that dead trees and shrubs had provided; the loss 
  of firewood, traditional medicine species, and emergency food species render 
  them more vulnerable to future environmental change.</p>
<p>Adaptations by farmers and herders in Africa to climate change and desertification 
  have involved diversification and intensification of resource use (Davies, 1996; 
  Downing <i>et al.,</i> 1997). Resourceful diversification responses by women 
  in Bambara and Fulbe households in Mali (Adams <i>et al.,</i> 1998) reflect 
  the importance of women in guiding adaptation strategies across Africa. In southern 
  Kenya, Maasai herders have adopted farming as a supplement to or replacement 
  for livestock herding (Campbell, 1999). In Kano, Nigeria, peri-urban vegetable 
  gardening has expanded (Adams and Mortimore, 1997), revealing a common diversification 
  trend in small cities across west Africa. In northern Cameroon, Fulbe herders 
  have increased the number of herd displacements between pasture areas and even 
  resorted to long-distance migration, sometimes introducing significant changes 
  to their way of life (Pamo, 1998).</p>
<p>In the future, seasonal climate forecasting (NOAA, 1999; Stern and Easterling, 
  1999) may assist farmers and herders to know times of higher probability of 
  success of resource diversification or intensification. Seasonal forecasts for 
  Africa currently exhibit moderate skill levels (Thiaw <i>et al.,</i> 1999) but 
  skill levels and user communications are not yet high enough to permit users 
  to confidently implement field applications (UNSO, 1999; Broad and Agrawala, 
  2000). Neither trade nor technology will likely avert the widespread nutritional 
  and economic effects of desertification through the 2020s (Scherr, 1999).</p>
<p>Other adaptations to desertification involve more efficient management of resources. 
  In Niger, farmers with access to credit will adopt low-cost, appropriate technologies 
  for wind erosion control, including windbreaks, mulching, ridging, and rock 
  bunds (Baidu-Forson and Napier, 1998). Across Africa, farmers traditionally 
  have adapted to harsh environmental conditions by promoting natural regeneration 
  of local trees and shrubs. Natural regeneration is a practice whereby farmers 
  and herders seek to reconstitute vegetative cover by setting aside parcels of 
  land or by selecting valued trees in their fields, pruning them, straightening 
  them, and raising them to maturity. The Sereer in Senegal (Lericollais, 1973) 
  and the Mossi in Burkina Faso (Kessler, 1992) have achieved doubling of tree 
  densities in certain semi-arid areas with Acacia albida and Butyrospermum parkii, 
  respectively.</p>
