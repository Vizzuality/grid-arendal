<h2>12.3. Water Supply and Hydrology </h2>
<a name="1231"></a> 
<h3>12.3.1. Water Supply</h3>
<p>Dry conditions in most parts of Australia tend to be associated with El Ni&ntilde;o. 
  The link between rainfall and streamflow and ENSO is statistically significant 
  in most parts of eastern Australia (Chiew <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Power <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998). Relationships between river flows and ENSO also have been identified 
  for some seasons in parts of New Zealand (McKerchar <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Because 
  of the relatively high variability of Australian rainfall, the storage capacities 
  of Australia's large dams are about six times larger than those of European 
  dams for the same mean annual streamflow and probability of water shortfall. 
  In contrast, New Zealand's hydroelectricity system has a total storage 
  capacity of about 6 weeks of national demand because of its higher and more 
  reliable rainfall (Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>The Murray-Darling River basin is the largest in Australia and is heavily regulated 
  by dams and weirs. About 40% of mean annual flow is used for human consumption, 
  principally through irrigation; there is high interannual variability. Application 
  of the CSIRO (1996a) scenarios, with their wide range of rainfall changes as 
  a result of inclusion of both the older slab-ocean GCM and the more recent coupled 
  AOGCM simulations, suggests a possible combination of small or larger decreases 
  in mean annual rainfall, higher temperatures and evaporation, and a higher frequency 
  of floods and droughts in northern Victorian rivers (Schreider <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). A study of the Macquarie River basin in NSW indicates inflow reductions 
  on the order of 10-30% for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> and reduced streamflows 
  if irrigation demand remains constant or increases (Hassall and Associates <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1998). Adelaide and Perth traditionally have been regarded as the most 
  vulnerable metropolitan areas to future water supply problems, including increasing 
  levels of salinity (Schofield <i>et al.</i>, 1988; Williams, 1992; PMSEIC, 1998; 
  MDBC, 1999), although Perth recently has decided to spend AU$275 million for 
  drought-proofing (Boer, 2000). Water supplies are adequate for many coastal 
  regions in Australia. However, drier inland areas are vulnerable to water shortages 
  during the annual dry season and drought.</p>
<p>Studies by Kothavala (1999) and Arnell (1999)&#151;using results from the U.S. 
  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCMO) 
  GCM and the HadCM2 and HadCM3 AOGCMs, respectively&#151;show increases in drought 
  across eastern and southern Australia. Kothavala found that the Palmer Drought 
  Index showed longer and more severe drought in northeastern and southeastern 
  Australia. Arnell (1999) found marked decreases in runoff over most of mainland 
  Australia but some increases over Tasmania. For the Murray-Darling basin, he 
  found decreases in mean flow by the 2050s ranging from about 12 to 35%, with 
  decreases in the magnitude of 10-year maximum and minimum monthly runoff.</p>
<p>The only recent water supply study for New Zealand is that by Fowler (1999), 
  based on the RSNZ (1988) and Mullan and Renwick (1990) regional climate change 
  scenarios and three equilibrium slab-ocean GCM simulations. These models give 
  scenarios of rainfall increases in the Auckland region, leading to the conclusion 
  that changes in water resources most likely would be positive. Scenarios based 
  on recent AOGCM simulations have yet to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Atolls and low-lying islands (e.g., some in the Torres Strait and in association 
  with New Zealand) rely on rainwater or limited groundwater resources for water 
  supplies. These resources are sensitive to climate variations and in some cases 
  already are stressed by increasingly unsustainable demand and pollution caused 
  by human activity. Saltwater intrusion into aquifers might occur through sea-level 
  rise, more frequent storm events, possible reductions in rainfall, and increased 
  water demand as a result of higher temperatures (see Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998; 
  Chapter 17).</p>
<a name="1232"></a> 
<h3>12.3.2. Water Allocation and Policy</h3>
<p>Until recently, water planning in Australia was driven by demand and controlled 
  by engineers, not by economics (Smith, 1998b). This situation has changed with 
  growing population and demand (rural and urban/industrial), including rapid 
  growth in irrigation of high-value crops such as cotton and vineyards. There 
  also is an increasing awareness of stress on riverine ecosystems as a result 
  of reduced mean flows, lower peak flows, and increasing salinity and algal blooms. 
  Higher temperatures and changed precipitation as a result of climate change 
  generally would exacerbate these problems and sharpen competition among water 
  users (e.g., see Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i>, 1998). In 1995, the Council 
  of Australian Governments reviewed water resource policy in Australia and agreed 
  to implement a strategic framework to achieve an efficient and sustainable water 
  industry through processes to address water allocations, including provision 
  of water for the environment and water-trading arrangements. The Agriculture 
  and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand subsequently commissioned 
  a set of National Principles for the Provision of Water for Ecosystems, with 
  the following stated goal: "To sustain and where necessary restore ecological 
  processes and biodiversity of water-dependent ecosystems." Implementation 
  of water reforms and national principles has resulted in the definition of conceptual 
  frameworks and practical methods for assessing the water requirements of environmental 
  systems.<br>
  <br>
  In Australia, flow recommendations commonly are developed after water infrastructure 
  projects and dams have been in place for some time and environmental flows implemented 
  in river systems that already are experiencing a modified or regulated flow 
  regime (Arthington, 1998; Arthington <i>et al.</i>, 1998). This situation is 
  most applicable to adaptation to climate change in existing regulated flow regimes. 
</p>
<p>The Australian National Principles require that provision of water for ecosystems 
  should use the best scientific information available on the hydrological regimes 
  necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems. Ideally, environmental flow recommendations 
  are based on establishment of quantitative relationships between flow characteristics 
  and desired geomorphological, ecological, or water-quality outcomes. Methods 
  are available to estimate flow-related habitat requirements of aquatic invertebrates, 
  fish, and aquatic and riparian plants (e.g., wetted perimeter, transect methods, 
  instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM)&#151;see Kinhill, 1988). However, 
  there are no standard methods for assessing flows that are relevant to maintenance 
  of key life history processes. In the absence of robust biological indicators 
  of response to flow regulation, recent research has advocated the use of statistical 
  descriptors of flow regimes. These methods include maintenance of critical flow 
  characteristics within one or two standard deviations of mean parameters (Richter 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996).</p>
<p>In New Zealand, various pressures on riverine ecosystems have been recognized, 
  including those from agriculture, urban usage and sewage, hydroelectricty and 
  water supply dams, forestry and mining, and introduced pests and weeds. Management 
  of water is covered by the Resource Management Act (RMA) of 1991. Under this 
  Act, the intrinsic values of ecosystems, including their biodiversity and life-supporting 
  capacity, must be considered. The emphasis has changed from multiple-use management 
  to environmentally sustainable management (Taylor and Smith, 1997), and Maori 
  values are explicitly recognized (Ministry for the Environment, 1999). Drought 
  associated with ENSO has placed stress on water supplies in various parts of 
  the country, and it is recognized that climate change could lead to further 
  stresses, especially if there is an increase in the frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events (Taylor and Smith, 1997). The RMA provides a statutory basis for integrated 
  catchment management in that regional Councils control land use, water use, 
  and water quality. Regional plans under which water is allocated have a term 
  of only 10 years, allowing for review to adapt to issues such as river flow 
  changes caused by climate change.</p>
<p>In the context of climate change, it is relevant to ask: How much can critical 
  features of the flow regime be changed before the system becomes seriously stressed? 
  Finding answers to this question for a range of Australian rivers is central 
  to the assessment and management of water allocations to sustain water-dependent 
  systems. Climate change has yet to be systematically injected into this process, 
  but at least the mechanisms are now in place to develop appropriate water allocations 
  and price incentives to use water to the best advantage. There also is scope 
  for increased application of seasonal climate forecasts in water resources management, 
  as a tool to aid adaptation to climate variability.</p>

<h3>12.3.3. Inland and Coastal Salinization </h3>
<p>Natural salinity and high water tables have been present in Australia for centuries. 
  However, because of changes in land management&#151;notably land clearing and 
  irrigation&#151;salinity is now a major environmental issue in Australia (Ghassemi 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995; MDBC, 1999). About 2.5 Mha are affected in Australia, with the 
  potential for this to increase to 12.5 Mha in the next 50 years (PMSEIC, 1999). 
  Much of this area covers otherwise productive agricultural land. The area damaged 
  by salinity to date represents about 4.5% of presently cultivated land, and 
  known costs include US$130 million annually in lost agricultural production, 
  US$100 million annually in damage to infrastructure (such as roads, fencing, 
  and pipes); and at least US$40 million in lost environmental assets (Watson 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997; PMSEIC, 1998). The average salinity of the lower Murray River 
  (from which Adelaide draws much of its water supply) is expected to exceed the 
  800 EC threshold for desirable drinking water about 50% of the time by 2020.</p>
<p>Although climate is a key factor affecting the rate of salinization and the 
  severity of impacts, a comprehensive assessment of the effects of climate change 
  on this problem has not yet been carried out. Revegetation policies and associated 
  carbon credit motivational policies designed to increase carbon sinks are likely 
  to have a significant impact on recharge. However, global warming and dryland 
  salinity policies need to be coordinated to maximize synergistic impacts. </p>
<p>In many coastal areas and oceanic islands, development and management of fresh 
  groundwater resources are seriously constrained by the presence of seawater 
  intrusion. Seawater intrusion is a natural phenomenon that occurs as a consequence 
  of the density contrast between fresh and saline groundwater. If conditions 
  remain unperturbed, the saline water body will remain stationary unless it moves 
  under tidal influences. However, when there is pumping of freshwater, sea-level 
  change, or changing recharge conditions, the saline body will gradually move 
  until a new equilibrium condition is achieved (Ghassemi <i>et al.</i>, 1996). If the 
  sea level rises to its "best-guess" or extreme predicted value over 
  the next century, this would significantly increase intrusion of seawater in 
  coastal and island aquifers.</p>
<a name="1234"></a> 
<h3>12.3.4. Water Quality </h3>
<p>Water quality would be affected by changes in biota, particularly microfauna 
  and flora; water temperature; CO<sub>2</sub> concentration; transport processes that place 
  water, sediment, and chemicals in streams and aquifers; and the timing and volume 
  of water flow. More intense rainfall events would increase fast runoff, soil 
  erosion, and sediment loadings, and further deforestation and urbanization would 
  tend to increase runoff amounts and flood wave speed. These effects would increase 
  the risk of flash flooding, sediment load, and pollution (Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998). 
  On the other hand, increases in plantation and farm forestry&#151;in part for 
  carbon sequestration and greenhouse mitigation purposes&#151;would tend to reduce 
  soil erosion and sediment loads.</p>
<p>Eutrophication is a major water quality problem in Australia (State of the 
  Environment, 1996). This is a natural process, but it has been greatly accelerated 
  in Australia by human activities, including sewage effluent and runoff from 
  animal farms, irrigation, and stormwater. Low flow, abundant light, clear water, 
  and warmth all encourage algal growth, which affects the taste and odor of water 
  and can be toxic to animals, fish, and humans. Thus, local climate warming and 
  the potential for reduced streamflow may lead to increased risk of eutrophication.</p>
