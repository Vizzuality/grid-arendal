<p><a name="fig117"></a>Although these AOGCMs treat the complex interactions of 
  atmospheric physics and planetary-scale dynamics fairly well, coarse horizontal 
  resolution in the models restricts realistic simulation of climatic details 
  on spatial variability. For example, tropical precipitation has high temporal 
  and spatial variability, which cannot be resolved realistically in currently 
  available AOGCMs. Many investigations on the ability of GCMs to simulate the 
  Asian monsoon have been reported in the literature (e.g., Meehl and Washington, 
  1993; Chakraborty and Lal, 1994; Bhaskaran et al., 1995; Lal et al., 1995a, 
  1997, 1998a,b). These studies suggest that although most GCMs are able to simulate 
  the large-scale monsoon circulation well, generally they are less successful 
  with the summer monsoon rainfall. Since the SAR, nested modeling approaches 
  have been followed to generate high-resolution regional climate scenarios (Jones 
  et al., 1995; Lal et al., 1998c; Hassell and Jones, 1999) with more realistic 
  mesoscale details and the response of GHG forcings to the surface climatology 
  over the Asian monsoon region.</p>
<p>Large-scale patterns of temperature change simulated by GCMs and nested regional 
  climate models (RCMs) are found to be generally similar under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  forcing, but the regional model results present some additional details associated 
  with coastline and local topographical features (Hirakuchi and Giorgi, 1995). 
  In addition, projected warming over eastern China region in the summer is less 
  pronounced in the RCM than in the GCM and is characterized by a different spatial 
  pattern. This is related to an increase in monsoon precipitation simulated by 
  the RCM there and associated surface cooling induced by evaporation and cloudiness. 
  Nonetheless, the GCM and RCM simulations suggest a general increase in warming 
  toward higher latitudes and greater warming in winter than in summer. The RCM 
  produces a more pronounced increase in winter precipitation over southeastern 
  China than does the GCM in response to orographic lifting of stronger low-level 
  southerly onshore winds. The RCM also simulates increased precipitation in the 
  monsoon rain belt over east China, Korea, and Japan during the summer. </p>
<p>The increase in surface air temperature simulated by the RCM over central and 
  northern India is not as intense as in the GCM and does not extend as far south 
  (Lal et al., 1998c; Hassell and Jones, 1999). These anomalies are linked with 
  changes in surface hydrological variables. Summer precipitation exhibits a more 
  complex pattern of increases and decreases. Whereas an increase in rainfall 
  is simulated over the eastern region of India, northwestern deserts see a small 
  decrease in the absolute amount of rainfall in RCM simulation (<a href="#fig117">Figure 
  11-7</a>). Changes in soil moisture broadly follow those in precipitation except 
  in eastern India, where they decrease as a result of enhanced drainage from 
  the soil. The largest reductions (precipitation reduced to &lt;1 mm day-1; 60% 
  decline in soil moisture) are simulated in the arid regions of northwest India 
  and Pakistan. The projected increase in precipitation in flood-prone Bangladesh 
  is approximately 20%. Nested RCM simulations have the potential to simulate 
  the onset of the summer monsoon and its active/break cycle over India. The RCM 
  captures the observed precipitation maximum over the southern tip of India during 
  weak monsoon conditions, whereas the GCM does not. </p>
<p>Given the current state of climate modeling, projections of future regional 
  climate have only limited confidence. The degree of confidence that could be 
  attributed to RCM responses in terms of temporal and spatial changes resulting 
  from GHG forcings would depend on more accurate simulation of the space and 
  time evolution of large-scale monsoon circulation features in AOGCMs, as well 
  as additional long-term RCM simulations with better skill. Current efforts on 
  climate variability and climate change studies increasingly rely on diurnal, 
  seasonal, latitudinal, and vertical patterns of temperature trends to provide 
  evidence for anthropogenic signatures. Such approaches require increasingly 
  detailed understanding of the spatial variability of all forcing mechanisms 
  and their connections to global, hemispheric, and regional responses. Because 
  the anthropogenic aerosol burden in the troposphere would have large spatial 
  and temporal variations in the atmosphere, its future impact on regional scale 
  would be in striking contrast to the impact from GHGs. It has also been suggested 
  that aerosols produced by tropical biomass burning could lead to additional 
  negative radiative forcing (Portmann et al., 1997). Considerable uncertainty 
  prevails about the indirect effect of aerosols on tropospheric clouds, which 
  could strongly modulate the climate. The implications of localized radiative 
  forcing on deep convection in tropical Asia and on Hadley circulation are still 
  not understood (Lal et al., 2000).</p>
