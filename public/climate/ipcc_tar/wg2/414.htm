<h2>11.1. The Asian Region </h2>
<h3><a name="1111"></a>11.1.1. Background</h3>
<p>Following publication of its Second Assessment Report (SAR) and on recommendation 
  of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the Conference 
  of the Parties, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published 
  its Special Report on the Regional Impacts of Climate Change in early 1998, 
  providing assessments of the vulnerability of natural ecosystems, socioeconomic 
  sectors, and human health to climate change for 10 regions of the globe (IPCC, 
  1998). That Special Report served as guidance material, illustrating for the 
  first time the potential character and magnitude of region-specific impacts&#151;though 
  often in qualitative sense only, based on a diverse range of methods and tools. 
</p>
<p>A key message of the regional assessments in that report was that "many 
  systems and policies are not well adjusted even to today's climate and 
  climate variability." Several examples cited, based on information gathered 
  during country study and other projects, demonstrate current vulnerability in 
  the Asian region as a result of increasing risks to human life and property 
  from floods, storms, and droughts in recent decades. The report suggests that, 
  as a consequence of climate change, there could be a large reduction in the 
  area and productivity of forests in boreal Asia. In arid and semi-arid regions 
  of Asia, water shortage&#151;already a limiting factor for ecosystems, food 
  and fiber production, human settlements, and human health&#151;may be exacerbated 
  by climate change. Limited water supplies and land degradation problems are 
  likely to threaten the food security of some countries in this region. Major 
  changes in the composition and distribution of vegetation types of semi-arid 
  areas&#151;for example, grasslands, rangelands, and woodlands&#151;are anticipated. 
  In temperate Asia, changes in temperature and precipitation may result in altered 
  growing seasons and boundary shifts between grasslands, forests, and shrublands. 
  An increase in temperature could lead to oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems, 
  fish diseases, and introduction of unwanted species, as well as potential negative 
  factors such as changes in established reproductive patterns, migration routes, 
  and ecosystem relationships in temperate Asia. A rise in sea level will endanger 
  sandy beaches in the coastal zones and add further to the problems of tectonically 
  and anthropogenically induced land subsidence in deltaic regions of temperate 
  Asia. Substantial elevational shifts of ecosystems in the mountains and uplands 
  of tropical Asia are projected. Increases in temperature and seasonal variability 
  in precipitation are expected to result in more rapid recession of Himalayan 
  glaciers. Climate change impacts could result in significant changes in crop 
  yields, production, storage, and distribution in this region. Densely settled 
  and intensively used low-lying coastal plains, islands, and deltas in Asia are 
  extremely vulnerable to coastal erosion and land loss, inundation and sea flooding, 
  and upstream movement of saline water fronts as a result of sea-level rise. 
  The incidence and extent of vector-borne diseases, which are significant causes 
  of mortality and morbidity in tropical Asia, are likely to spread into new regions 
  on the margins of present endemic areas as a result of climate change.</p>
<p>The 1998 Special Report underscores that, in many countries of Asia, economic 
  policies and conditions (e.g., taxes, subsidies, and regulations) that shape 
  decisionmaking, development strategies, and resource-use patterns (hence environmental 
  conditions) hinder implementation of adaptation measures. For example, water 
  is subsidized in most developing countries of Asia, encouraging overuse (which 
  draws down existing sources) and discouraging conservation measures that may 
  be elements of future adaptation strategies. Other examples are inappropriate 
  land-use zoning and subsidized disaster insurance, which encourage infrastructure 
  development in areas that are prone to flooding or other natural disasters&#151;areas 
  that could become even more vulnerable as a result of climate change. Adaptation 
  and better incorporation of the long-term environmental consequences of resource 
  use can be brought about through a range of approaches, including strengthening 
  legal and institutional frameworks, removing pre-existing market distortions 
  (e.g., subsidies), correcting market failures (e.g., failure to reflect environmental 
  damage or resource depletion in prices or inadequate economic valuation of biodiversity), 
  and promoting public participation and education. These types of actions would 
  adjust resource-use patterns to current environmental conditions and better 
  prepare systems for potential future changes.</p>
<p>The 1998 Special Report emphasizes that the challenge lies in identifying opportunities 
  that would facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing technologies 
  and developing policies that make climate-sensitive sectors resilient to today's 
  climate variability. This strategy will require developing countries of Asia 
  to have access to appropriate technologies, information, and adequate financing. 
  In addition, adaptation will require anticipation and planning; failure to prepare 
  systems for projected change in climate means, variability, and extremes could 
  lead to capital-intensive development of infrastructure or technologies that 
  are ill-suited to future conditions, as well as missed opportunities to lower 
  the costs of adaptation. </p>
<p>Subsequent to publication of the 1998 Special Report, some advances in our 
  ability to better understand the likely future state of social, economic, and 
  environmental factors controlling the emission and concentration of greenhouse 
  gases (GHGs) and aerosols that alter the radiative forcings of climate have 
  been made. Details on future projections of climatic and environmental changes 
  on finer scales also are now better understood. This chapter presents an update 
  on the climate change projections for Asia and examines how projected changes 
  in climate could affect social, environmental, and economic sectors in the region.</p>
