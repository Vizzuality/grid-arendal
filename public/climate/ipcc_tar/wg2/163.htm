<h3>4.2.3. Increased Awareness of the Effect of Climatic Variability on Hydrology 
  and Water Resources </h3>
<p>Since the SAR, many studies have explored linkages between recognizable patterns 
  of climatic variability&#151;particularly El Ni&ntilde;o and the North Atlantic 
  Oscillation&#151;and hydrological behavior, in an attempt to explain variations 
  in hydrological characteristics over time. These studies in North America (McCabe, 
  1996; Piechota et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997; Olsen et al., 1999), South 
  America (Marengo, 1995; Compagnucci and Vargas, 1998), Australasia (Chiew et 
  al., 1998), Europe (e.g., Shorthouse and Arnell, 1997), and southern Africa 
  (Shulze, 1997) have emphasized variability not just from year to year but also 
  from decade to decade, although patterns of variability vary considerably from 
  region to region. Most studies focus on the past few decades with recorded hydrological 
  data, but an increasing number of studies have reconstructed considerably longer 
  records from various proxy data sources (e.g., Isdale et al., 1998; Cleaveland, 
  2000). Such research is extremely valuable because it helps in interpretation 
  of observed hydrological changes over time (particularly attribution of change 
  to global warming), provides a context for assessment of future change, and 
  opens up possibilities for seasonal flow prediction (e.g., Piechota et al., 
  1998) hence more efficient adaptation to climatic variability. It also emphasizes 
  that the hydrological &#147;baseline&#148; cannot be assumed to be constant, 
  even in the absence of climate change. </p>
<h3><a name="424"></a>4.2.4. Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector</h3>
<p>Water management is based on minimization of risk and adaptation to changing 
  circumstances (usually taking the form of altered demands). A wide range of 
  adaptation techniques has been developed and applied in the water sector over 
  decades. One widely used classification distinguishes between increasing capacity 
  (e.g., building reservoirs or structural flood defenses), changing operating 
  rules for existing structures and systems, managing demand, and changing institutional 
  practices. The first two often are termed &#147;supply-side&#148; strategies, 
  whereas the latter two are &#147;demand-side.&#148; Over the past few years, 
  there has been a considerable increase in interest in demand-side techniques. 
  International agencies such as the World Bank (World Bank, 1993) and initiatives 
  such as the Global Water Partnership are promoting new ways of managing and 
  pricing water resources to manage resources more effectively (Kindler, 2000).</p>
<p>This work is going on largely independently of climate change, but changes 
  in water management practices will have a very significant impact on how climate 
  change affects the water sector. Water managers in some countries are beginning 
  to consider climate change explicitly, although the methodologies for doing 
  so are not yet well defined and vary between and within countries depending 
  on the institutional arrangements for long-term water resources planning. In 
  the UK, for example, water supply companies were required by regulators in 1997 
  to &#147;consider&#148; climate change in estimating their future resource, 
  hence investment, projections (Subak, 2000). In the United States, the American 
  Water Works Association urged water agencies to explore the vulnerability of 
  their systems to plausible climate changes (AWWA, 1997). </p>
<p>Clearly, however, the ability of water management agencies to alter management 
  practices in general or to incorporate climate change varies considerably between 
  countries. This issue is discussed further in <a href="186.htm">Section 4.6.</a></p>
