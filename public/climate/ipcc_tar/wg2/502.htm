<h4>13.2.2.3. Freshwater Ecosystems: Inland Wetlands, Lakes, and Streams </h4>
<p>European freshwater ecosystems encompass a varied assemblage of systems: lakes 
  of various sizes and depth; streams with different hydrological characteristics; 
  and wetlands, which by definition occupy a spatial continuum between aquatic 
  and terrestrial environments. Wetlands are heterogeneous systems ranging from 
  open-water surfaces to densely vegetated areas. Some wetlands are forested; 
  shrubs, grasses, or mosses dominate others. European freshwater systems have 
  been heavily subjected to and modified by damming, channeling, drainage, and 
  other hydrological alterations; they also are influenced by humans through land 
  and water use, pollution, erosion, and other factors. </p>
<p>The fundamental requirement for the existence of freshwater ecosystems is the 
  spatial and temporal distribution of water in the landscape. The impacts of 
  climate change on the future distribution and extent of these systems are analogous 
  to those discussed in <a href="497.htm#13211">Section 13.2.1.1</a>. However, 
  apart from these impacts, changes in climatic parameters also will impact a 
  range of chemical and biological functions, which combine with physical parameters 
  to create the integrated ecological characteristics of future freshwater ecosystems 
  in Europe. During the past 150 years, the winter ice cover of streams and lakes 
  has declined, and in the northern hemisphere there has been a steady trend toward 
  later freeze and earlier ice breakup (Magnuson et al., 2000). Climate warming 
  is likely to exaggerate this trend, and the timing and duration of freeze and 
  breakup of ice in freshwater systems greatly affect inherent biological and 
  ecological processes. </p>
<p>In the arctic and subarctic, freshwater systems are particularly sensitive 
  to climate change-and most climate change scenarios indicate that the highest 
  and most rapid temperature increases will occur in these regions. Increases 
  in temperature may lead to changes in permafrost distribution (Anisimov and 
  Nelson, 1996, 1997), with concomitant impacts on hydrology. In many wetland 
  areas, permafrost acts as a drainage seal and promotes wetland development. 
  However, Camill and Clark (1998) suggest that high-latitude systems might show 
  lagged and complex dynamics in response to global warming, and local factors 
  may exert more direct control over permafrost than regional ones. The estimated 
  effect of climate change on average runoff in tundra regions is highly uncertain, 
  but if water levels decrease, connections between tundra lakes could be severed. 
  This would result in changes in community structure and possibly elimination 
  of seasonal migrants to shallow, ice-covered winterkill lakes. Climate change 
  impacts on ice breakup timing and intensity also will influence limnological 
  characteristics by regulating the supply and flux of nutrients (Lesack et al., 
  1991). Furthermore, such changes impact the influx of sunlight, which is a key 
  factor in controlling primary productivity but also can have far-reaching effects 
  on higher trophic levels. The populations of arctic char (and presumably other 
  extreme coldwater fish species) are expected to decrease, especially in low-altitude, 
  shallow lakes (Lehtonen, 1998). </p>
<p>In the boreal areas, scenarios typically display warmer winters (e.g., a shorter 
  season of sub-zero temperatures). This would affect snow-cover conditions and 
  lead to changes in the timing and intensity of snowmelt events and runoff characteristics, 
  which would affect the ecological functions of freshwater systems. Wetland development 
  might benefit if larger fractions of precipitation fell as rain, but the impact 
  would depend on how temperature-induced higher evapotranspiration rates would 
  counteract this effect, as well as topographical characteristics of the landscape. 
  In response to higher temperatures, northern boreal populations of cyprinid 
  and percid fish species are expected to increase at the expense of coldwater, 
  salmonid species (Lehtonen, 1996). Shallow lakes would be most susceptible to 
  these changes because of their lack of thermal stratification. Total freshwater 
  fish production is expected to increase, but with the projected changes in the 
  composition of fish fauna, the recreational and commercial value of catches 
  will decrease (Lehtonen, 1996). A reduction in the spatial and temporal extent 
  of lake and stream ice cover as a result of warmer winters can decrease light 
  attenuation, which is a major limiting factor for production in boreal aquatic 
  systems. Such a change could be expected to cause shifts in the biota of lakes 
  and streams. It also can reduce winter anoxia that typically occurs in shallow 
  lakes. Haapalea and Lepparänta (1997) modeled future ice-cover distribution 
  in the Baltic Sea (which contains freshwater communities in the north). Simulations 
  with a warming of 3.6°C to 2050 reduced the extent of ice cover from 38 to 10%, 
  and a 6.6°C warming to 2100 resulted in no ice cover. The projected increase 
  in biomass productivity in terrestrial systems also would affect lakes and streams 
  because of alterations in the amount and quality of water and solid material 
  inputs. Organic matter inputs are expected to increase when plant productivity 
  increases and would be beneficial for heterotrophic organisms. Increases in 
  organic matter concentrations also result in effects such as reduced light penetration 
  (including damaging UV-B radiation-Schindler and Curtis, 1997) and changes in 
  the vertical distribution of solar heating (Schindler et al., 1996). In lakes, 
  increased summer temperatures could lead to more pronounced thermal stratification, 
  resulting in reduced secondary productivity as well as anoxic conditions in 
  the hypolimnion. Warmer surface water can reduce the nutritional value of edible 
  phytoplankton, but it also may shift primary production toward green algae and 
  cyanobacteria, which are less favored by secondary consumers. </p>
<p>The dominating wetland types in the boreal regions are peatlands. Typically, 
  the vegetation pattern and composition of boreal peatlands are governed by moisture 
  regime rather than temperature and show high spatial variability in plant communities 
  caused by variation in topography. It follows that a change in water balance 
  could affect the function of boreal wetlands, including their carbon sequestering 
  and carbon storage functions. A study in Finland suggests that very nutrient-poor 
  peatlands can increase their long-term soil carbon accumulation after drainage 
  (Minkkinen and Laine, 1998). In more nutrient-rich peatlands, however, soil 
  carbon sequestering rates decrease and could shift to potential sources of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. Cao et al. (1998) have suggested that a temperature increase 
  of less than 2°C could enhance methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission rates from 
  boreal wetlands, but greater warming might lead to reduction of fluxes because 
  of decreasing soil moisture. Furthermore, field manipulation and laboratory 
  experiments in Finland have shown that enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  (560 ppm) can lead to a 10-20% increase in CH<sub>4</sub> efflux from oligotrophic 
  mire lawn communities (Saarnio and Silvola, 1999; Saarnio et al., 2000). It 
  is likely that boreal peatlands will expand further north into subarctic/arctic 
  areas where the topography after permafrost disintegration still supports wetland 
  formation. </p>
<p>In temperate Europe, the potential for precipitation decreases that result 
  in lower flow rates could have major implications for lakes and streams. This 
  could lead to changes in habitat and breeding locations of aquatic flora and 
  fauna. These hydrological changes have the potential to be more significant 
  for freshwater organisms than a temperature increase. The effect of warmer winters 
  that lead to less extensive ice cover of lakes is expected to affect Europe's 
  temperate lakes and streams as discussed above. Wetlands in the temperate regions 
  of CEE are regarded as vulnerable to climate change (in combination with other 
  anthropogenic threats-Best et al., 1993; Hartig et al., 1997). In the past, 
  wetlands have been extensive in this area-for example, in the basins of the 
  Pechora, Severnaya Dvina, and Upper Dnieper Rivers and in Karelia they have 
  occupied 10-30% of the area. Now, many of them have been converted to agriculture, 
  are affected by agricultural drainage, or are used in other ways, such as growing 
  reed for thatch and livestock feed or collecting peat as a fuel for heating 
  and cooking. </p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, the risk of acute water shortage in response to global 
  warming would have severe impacts on freshwater ecosystems in the region. Hydrologically 
  isolated systems, such as wetlands in topographical depressions, would be the 
  most vulnerable, whereas those situated along larger rivers and lake shores 
  might be less sensitive (Mortsch, 1998), although the extent of the latter may 
  decrease as a result of lower flow rates. Increased competition for diminishing 
  water resources also poses a potential threat to freshwater ecosystems. Although 
  precipitation may increase during the winter-which is the main season for the 
  seasonal wetlands in this area-this probably will be accompanied by comparably 
  large increases in temperature, thus affecting net water availability. Summers 
  are predicted to become warmer and drier, which would lead to deterioration 
  of freshwater ecosystems (Haslam, 1997). Seasonal systems that presently can 
  cope with occasional or periodic drought will experience additional stress that 
  some species might not be able to survive (Brock and van Vierssen, 1992). The 
  fact that wetlands in many parts of southern and central Europe are scattered 
  in their location may prevent species migration to suitable climate conditions. 
  In general, wetland plants with short life cycles are better adapted for geographical 
  migration, indicating that this response is likely to occur faster in nonforested 
  wetlands than in forested ones. </p>
<p>The risk of increased fire disturbance of terrestrial biota also will have 
  consequences for lakes and streams in southern Europe. Freshwater systems adjacent 
  to burned areas will receive an initial increase in solute input after fire; 
  if the fire generates canopy gaps, the water bodies will be more influenced 
  by wind mixing, inducing changes in thermal and chemical stratification characteristics. 
</p>
<h4><a name="13224"></a>13.2.2.4. Biodiversity and Nature Conservation </h4>
<p>Europe is predominantly a region of fragmented natural or semi-natural habitats 
  in a highly urbanized, agricultural landscape. A significant proportion of surviving 
  semi-natural habitats of high conservation value is enclosed within protected 
  sites, which are especially important as refuges for threatened species (Plowman, 
  1995). Nature reserves form a similarly important conservation investment across 
  the whole of Europe. However, species distributions are projected to change 
  in response to climate change (Huntley and Webb, 1989), and valued communities 
  within reserves may disassociate, leaving species with nowhere to go (Peters 
  and Darling, 1985; Peters and Lovejoy, 1992), </p>
<p>The impact of climate change on a particular reserve will depend on its location 
  in relation to the climatic requirements of the species it accommodates. Sites 
  that lie near the current maximum temperature limits of particular species could 
  expect that if climate warms beyond those limits, species would become extinct 
  at that site. Conversely, sites that lie close to the minimum temperature limits 
  of species may assume greater importance for such species as the climate warms 
  (Huntley, 1999). In Europe, nature reserves tend to form habitat "islands" for 
  species in landscapes that are dominated by other land uses. The possibility 
  of species colonizing other habitat islands could be limited. As a result of 
  climate change, reserve communities may lose species at a faster rate than potential 
  new species can colonize, leading to a long period of impoverishment for many 
  reserves. </p>
<p>The requirements of a future conservation strategy in the advent of climate 
  change have been considered by Huntley et al. (1997). They suggest that for 
  Europe, where large-scale range changes are projected, a network of habitats 
  and habitat corridors will be required to facilitate migration. </p>
<p>Questions that urgently must be asked are as follows: To what extent do rare 
  and vulnerable species in Europe rely on protected areas for their survival 
  in the present day? Do current policy measures being implemented throughout 
  Europe under the Biodiversity Convention take into account the potential impacts 
  of climate change? It will become increasingly important for conservation strategies 
  to be developed on a pan-European scale to protect species in parts of their 
  ranges that are least likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. Reevaluation 
  of conservation priorities and the role of reserves is required for individual 
  sites and in relation to national and international conservation strategies 
  (Hendry and Grime, 1990; Parsons, 1991). </p>
<h4><a name="13225"></a>13.2.2.5. Migratory Animals </h4>
<p>Insects: Parmesan et al. (1999) analyzed data for 35 nonmigratory butterflies 
  with northern range limits in Great Britain, Sweden, Finland, or Estonia and 
  southern boundaries in southeastern France, Catalonia (Spain), Algeria, Tunisia, 
  or Morocco. More than 60% were found to have shifted north by 35-240 km in the 
  20th century, consistent with the 120-km northward shift of climatic isotherms 
  reported in the SAR. This finding is contrary to the trend that might have been 
  expected as a result of land-use change: Habitat loss has been greater in northern 
  European countries over this period than southern ones. Scientific knowledge 
  of butterfly biology supports the inference that this shift is in response to 
  increased temperatures. Population eruptions of several species of forest lepidoptera 
  in central Europe in the early 1990s, including the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar, 
  have been linked to increased temperatures (Wulf and Graser, 1996), as have 
  northward range expansions of several species of Odonata and Orthoptera (Kleukers 
  et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Insect pests: Most studies concur that insect pests are likely to become more 
  abundant in Europe as temperature rises, as a result of increased rates of population 
  development, growth, migration, and overwintering (Cannon, 1998). There has 
  been little or no reported research at the level of pest population dynamics, 
  however, about potential responses of insect pests to increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (Cannon, 1998). Although changes in rainfall also could have a substantial effect 
  (Lawton, 1995), this is difficult to quantify, particularly given uncertainties 
  with regional precipitation scenarios. Migratory species may be able to extend 
  their ranges as crop distributions change. For example, a 3°C rise in temperature 
  would advance the limit for grain maize across much of Europe, which could be 
  followed by a northward range expansion by the European corn borer Ostrinia 
  nubilalis of as much as 1,220 km (Parry et al., 1990; Porter et al., 1991; Porter, 
  1995). </p>
<p>Birds: Climate change in Europe already has been demonstrated to be affecting 
  migratory wild bird populations. In the UK, 20 of 65 species, including long-distance 
  migrants, significantly advanced their egg-laying dates by 8 days, on average, 
  between 1971 and 1995 (Crick et al., 1997; Crick and Sparks, 1999). In general, 
  species show advancement in average arrival and laying dates of about 3-5 days 
  per 1°C. It is quite likely that birds will be able to adapt faster than most 
  taxa to such changes, given their mobility and genetic variability (e.g., Berthold 
  and Helbig, 1992). However, increased aridity in the Mediterranean region may 
  be detrimental to the trans-Saharan migrants that use the area for foraging 
  en route. Potentially great problems face the internationally important populations 
  of waterfowl that use a relatively limited number of sites for wintering or 
  while on passage in Europe. Where sea-level rise causes coastal squeeze on the 
  availability of intertidal feeding areas (because sea defenses prohibit encroachment 
  onto currently dry land), feeding resources available to wintering waterbirds 
  may become limited and lead to population declines (Norris and Buisson, 1994). 
  Arctic-breeding shorebirds are predicted to benefit in the short term as warmer 
  temperatures increase the numbers of their insect food supplies, but in the 
  long term they may suffer from the disappearance of their habitat as vegetation 
  zones move northward toward the limit of any land (Lindström and Agrell, 1999).</p>
