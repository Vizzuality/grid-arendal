<h2>7.7. Science and Information Needs </h2>
<p>Our ability to answer questions about climate change, vulnerability, and adaptation 
  on the basis of research evidence is very limited for human settlements, energy, 
  and industry. Energy has been regarded mainly as an issue for Working Group 
  III, related more to causes of climate change than to impacts. Industry generally 
  has been considered relatively insensitive to most primary climate change impacts, 
  although some sectors (e.g., agroindustry) are dependent on supply streams that 
  could be vulnerable to climate change impacts. Impacts of climate change on 
  human settlements are hard to forecast, at least partly because the ability 
  to project climate change at an urban or smaller scale has been so limited. 
  As a result, more research is needed on impacts and adaptations in human settlements. 
  Several activities also have been developed by governments in the area of "sustainable 
  communities," which are designed primarily to reduce the impact of human settlements 
  on the environment. Many of the actions recommended also reduce the vulnerability 
  of settlements to global warming. Some areas of information required to support 
  these programs have been identified by organizations such as the United Nations' 
  International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR Secretariat), the 
  ICLEI, and the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development. Others were 
  identified during preparation of the FAR, SAR, RICC, and this report.</p>

<p>The highest priority needs for research on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerabilities 
  in human settlements are as follows: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>A much larger number and variety of bottom-up empirical case studies of 
    climate change impacts and possible responses in settlements in the developing 
    and industrialized world 
  <li>More reliable climate change scenarios at the scale of urban and even smaller 
    areas 
  <li>Improved understanding of how climate change interacts with integrated multiple-stress 
    contexts in human settlements, including possible ramifications of global 
    urbanization 
  <li> Improved understanding of adaptation pathways, their costs and benefits, 
    and what can reasonably be expected from them, especially in resource-constrained 
    developing regions (includes autonomous and planned adaptation, as well as 
    traditional and local adaptation; for example, analysis of water demand lags 
    analysis of energy use in most countries) 
  <li> Improved understanding of the effects of climate on human migration and 
    the effects of migration on source and destination settlements 
  <li>Improved understanding of critical climate change vulnerabilities in settlements, 
    including conceivable low-probability, high-impact effects of climate change 
    (need for continuing research and capacity-building efforts to improve preparedness 
    and strengthen early warning and other mitigation aspects; establishment of 
    a tropical cyclone landfall program is regarded as a logical vehicle for carrying 
    research and development initiatives into the 21st century) 
  <li> Better understanding of the particular vulnerabilities of livelihoods and 
    settlements of low-income and marginalized groups 
  <li>Improved understanding of the implications of climate variability and change 
    for the well-being of human settlements as they relate to other sectors, other 
    places, and the broader sustainable development process 
  <li>Improved understanding of the cascading of climate change through primary, 
    secondary, and tertiary impacts within human settlements (a conclusion of 
    the RICC, but not yet addressed effectively) 
  <li> Improved analytical capability to incorporate uncertainty, ambiguity, and 
    indeterminacy in assessments of impacts and response strategies, at least 
    partly by strengthening the science base for integrating quantitative and 
    qualitative analysis, including undertakings such as scenario development 
    and stakeholder participation. 
</ul>
<p>Other key challenges to be faced include development of essential scientific 
  and technical capacity in vulnerable regions, establishment and maintenance 
  of adequate meteorological and hydrological monitoring networks, and improvement 
  of seasonal and interannual prediction. </p>
