<h2>9.1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
<p>This chapter assesses how climatic changes and associated environmental and 
  social changes are likely to affect human population health. Such an assessment 
  necessarily takes account of the multivariate and interactive ecological framework 
  within which population health and disease are determined. This ecological perspective 
  recognizes that the foundations of long-term good health lie in the continued 
  stability and functioning of the biosphere's natural systems&#151;often 
  referred to as "life-support systems." </p>
<p>Deliberate modification of these ecological and physical systems by human societies 
  throughout history has conferred many social, economic, and public health benefits. 
  However, it also has often created new risks to health, such as via mobilization 
  of infectious agents, depletion of freshwater supplies, and reduced productivity 
  of agroecosystems (Hunter <i>et al</i>., 1993; Gubler, 1996). Consider, for 
  example, the chain of consequences from clearance of tropical forests. In the 
  first instance, it typically leads to a warmer and drier local climate. The 
  consequent drying of soil and loss of its organic structure predisposes the 
  area to increased water runoff during heavy rainfall. This, in turn, can endanger 
  human health via flooding, water contamination, impaired crop yields, and altered 
  patterns of vector-borne infectious diseases. Meanwhile, forest clearance also 
  contributes to the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and 
  hence to climate change and its health impacts.<br>
</p>
<p>Today, as the scale of human impact on the environment increases, a range of 
  population health impacts can be expected from these large-scale changes in 
  the Earth's life-support systems (Watson et al., 1998). That is the complex 
  context within which actual and potential health impacts of global climate change 
  must be assessed. <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="911"></a>9.1.1. Summary of IPCC Second Assessment Report (1996): 
  Potential Health Impacts of Climate Change </h3>
<p>The IPCC Second Assessment Report (McMichael et al., 1996a) relied on the relatively 
  limited scientific literature that had emerged during the late 1980s and early 
  1990s. Most published studies were on health impacts associated with climate 
  variability (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o) and extreme events (natural disasters and 
  heat waves). Predictive modeling of future health impacts was in an early developmental 
  stage. <br>
</p>
<p>The SAR noted the many inherent uncertainties in forecasting the potential 
  health impacts of climate change. This included recognition that various other 
  changes in social, economic, demographic, technological, and health care circumstances 
  would unfold over coming decades and that these developments would "condition" 
  the impact of climatic and environmental changes on human health. However, such 
  accompanying changes can be foreseen neither in detail nor far into the future. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The overall assessment was that the likely health impacts would be predominantly 
  adverse. Reflecting the published literature, most of the specific assessments 
  were nonquantitative and relied on expert judgment. They drew on reasoned extrapolations 
  from knowledge of health hazards posed by extreme weather events, increases 
  in temperature-dependent air pollution, summertime increases in certain types 
  of food poisoning, and the spectrum of public health consequences associated 
  with economic disruption and physical displacement of populations. It was noted 
  that the projected effects of climate change on agricultural, animal, and fishery 
  productivity could increase the prevalence of malnutrition and hunger in food-insecure 
  regions experiencing productivity downturns. <br>
</p>
<p>For two of the anticipated health impacts, the published literature available 
  by 1995 allowed a more quantitative approach. The relevant conclusions were 
  as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An increase in the frequency or severity of heat waves would cause a short-term 
    increase in (predominantly cardiorespiratory) deaths and illness. In some 
    very large cities (e.g., Atlanta, Shanghai) by about 2050, this would result 
    in up to several thousand extra heat-related deaths annually. This heat-related 
    mortality increase would be offset by fewer cold-related deaths in milder 
    winters, albeit to an extent that was not yet adequately estimated and likely 
    to vary between populations.</li>
  <li>Climate-induced changes in the geographic distribution and biological behavior 
    of vector organisms of vector-borne infectious diseases (e.g., malaria-transmitting 
    mosquitoes) and infective parasites would alter&#151;usually increase&#151;the 
    potential transmission of such diseases. For example, simulations with global/regional 
    mathematical models indicated that, in the absence of demographic shifts, 
    the proportion of the world's population living within the potential 
    malaria transmission zone would increase from ~45% in the 1990s to ~60% by 
    2050. Some localized decreases in malaria transmissibility also may occur 
    in response to climate change.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="912"></a>9.1.2. Population Health and its Significance as an Outcome 
  of Climate Change </h3>
<p>This is the last of the sector-impact chapters in this volume. This is appropriate 
  because human population health is influenced by an extensive "upstream" 
  range of environmental and social conditions. Indeed, over time, the level of 
  health in a population reflects the quality of social and natural environments, 
  material standards of living, and the robustness of the public health and health 
  service infrastructure. Therefore, population health is an important integrating 
  index of the effects of climate change on ecosystems, biological processes, 
  physical environmental media, and the social-economic environment.<br>
</p>
<p>Two other points are important. First, the causation of most human diseases 
  is complex and multifactorial. Second, there is great heterogeneity in the types 
  of disease: acute and chronic; infectious and noninfectious; physical injury 
  and mental health disorders. These two considerations explain some of the difficulties 
  in fully understanding and quantifying the influences of climate on human health.<br>
</p>
<p>Profiles of health and disease vary greatly between regions and countries and 
  over time. Currently, noncommunicable diseases (including mental health disorders) 
  predominate in developed countries, with cardiovascular diseases and cancer 
  accounting for more than half of all deaths. In poorer countries, infectious 
  diseases (especially in childhood) remain important, even as noncommunicable 
  diseases increase in urbanizing populations that are exposed to changes in lifestyle 
  and environmental and occupational exposures. Globally, infectious diseases 
  remain a major cause of human morbidity and are responsible for approximately 
  one-third of all deaths (WHO, 1999a). Many of these water-, food-, and vector-borne 
  infectious diseases are sensitive to climate.</p>
