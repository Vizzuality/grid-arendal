<h3>13.2.2. Semi-Natural Ecosystems and Forests </h3>
<h4><a name="13221"></a>13.2.2.1. Forests </h4>
<p>European forests belong to an important economic sector that is potentially 
  affected by climate change and changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
  Forests also have important interactions with global change processes as a result 
  of their sink potential. </p>
<p>Primarily, temperature and the availability of soil moisture limit the natural 
  range of European tree species. Some forests (particularly in the north) also 
  are nutrient-limited. The structure and composition of many forests is further 
  influenced by the natural disturbance regime (e.g., fire, insects, windthrow). 
  Most European forests are managed for one or several purposes, such as timber 
  production, water resources, or recreation. This management has reduced forest 
  area or strongly modified forest structure in most of Europe, and presently 
  existing forests often consist of species that are different from those that 
  would occur naturally. </p>
<p>In northern Europe, boreal forests are dominated by Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, 
  and these species grow well across most of their current distribution ranges. 
  Under warmer conditions, these species are likely to invade tundra regions (Sykes 
  and Prentice, 1996). In the southern boreal forests, these species are expected 
  to decline because of a concurrent increase of deciduous tree species (Kellomäki 
  and Kolström, 1993). Most climate change scenarios suggest a possible overall 
  displacement of the climatic zone that is suitable for boreal forests by 150-550 
  km over the next century (Kirschbaum et al., 1996). This shift in climatic conditions 
  would occur more rapidly than most species have ever migrated in the past (20-200 
  km per century-see Davis, 1981; Birks, 1989). Also questionable is whether soil 
  structural development would be able to follow. Turnover of current tree populations 
  may be enhanced, however, by changes in management practices and changing disturbance 
  regimes, such as increased fire frequency or increased strong winds in late 
  autumn and early spring (Solantie, 1986; Peltola et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Under most recent climate change scenarios, winters are likely to be still 
  cold enough to fulfill the chilling requirements of the main boreal tree species 
  (Myking and Heide, 1995; Leinonen, 1996; Häkkinen et al., 1998), but earlier 
  budburst can be expected. If summer and winter precipitation increase (as indicated 
  by some scenarios), boreal forests would become less susceptible to fire damages, 
  which currently affect about 0.05% of forests yr<sup>-1</sup> (Zackrisson and 
  Östlund, 1991). </p>
<p>At present, cold winters in boreal and some temperate regions protect forests 
  from many insects and fungi that are common further south (Straw, 1995). High 
  summer temperatures and associated drought increase the growth of existing insect 
  populations through enhanced physiological activity and turnover of insect populations. 
  Throughout Europe, forests seem to be quite well buffered against new species 
  coming from outside Europe, but the risk exists. A good example of new organisms 
  with large potential to damage trees is Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which originates 
  in North America. This pine nematode is easily transported in fresh timber, 
  but its success is related to temperature. Low summer temperatures and short 
  growing seasons have effectively limited the success of this species in northern 
  Europe (Tomminen and Nuorteva, 1987), although it frequently has occurred in 
  imported timber. Reductions in these limitations may result in increased damage 
  to trees. </p>
<p>In western and central Europe, the current forest structure and, in part, tree 
  species composition are determined mainly by past land use and management rather 
  than by natural factors (Ellenberg, 1986). Site-specific assessments of the 
  future composition of near-natural forests suggests that conifers (e.g., Picea 
  abies) may be replaced by deciduous species (e.g., Fagus sylvatica) at some 
  sites (e.g., Kräuchi, 1995). Until recently, our capability to assess long-term 
  forest dynamics at the regional scale was quite limited. Lindner et al. (1997) 
  provided the first assessment of regional-scale patterns of forest composition 
  under current and future climates. Their study suggests that future near-natural 
  forests in the state of Brandenburg (east Germany) would be much more uniform, 
  with little of the differentiation across different site types that shape today's 
  landscape. A temperature increase of 1-3°C would advance budburst of many tree 
  species by several weeks (Murray et al., 1989). Introduction of phenologically 
  suitable ecotypes or new species has been among the main tools to increase forest 
  growth (Lines, 1987). Minimum winter temperatures seem to be critical for the 
  survival of exotic species with insufficient winter frost hardiness-for example, 
  Nothofagus procera in Britain (Cannell, 1985). Therefore, higher winter temperatures 
  could broaden the potential distribution range of such species in Europe. </p>
<p>In southern Europe, most forests consist of sclerophyllous and some deciduous 
  species that are adapted to summer soil water deficit. Climate scenarios indicate 
  reduced water availability in the summer months and associated responses in 
  forests (e.g., Gavilán and Fernández-González, 1997), although the interactions 
  of this effect with enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is uncertain. Temperature 
  changes may allow expansion of some thermophilous tree species (e.g., Quercus 
  pyrenaica) when water availability is sufficient. In the Pyrenees, a northward 
  and upward movement of Mediterranean ecotypes is likely to occur with warming 
  accompanied by drier conditions. </p>
<h4> <a name="132211"></a>13.2.2.1.1. Growth trends </h4>
<p>Forest growth has increased during the past several decades in northern forests 
  (Lakida et al., 1997; Lelyakin et al., 1997; Myneni et al., 1997) and elsewhere 
  in Europe (Spiecker et al., 1996). Climate warming, increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  increased nitrogen deposition, and changes in management practices are factors 
  that are assumed to be behind the increase. The impacts of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  have been shown in experiments and are extrapolated by model calculations. For 
  example, under an assumed increase of CO<sub>2</sub> by 3.5 µmol mol<sup>-1</sup> 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> and temperature by 0.04°C yr<sup>-1</sup> over 100 years, productivity 
  of Pinus sylvestris increased by 5-15% as a result of the temperature elevation, 
  10-15% as a result of the increased CO<sub>2</sub>, and 20-30% as a result of 
  combined temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> (Kellomäki and Väisänen, 1997). In northern 
  Europe, the effects of precipitation changes are likely to be much less important 
  than the effects of temperature changes (Kellomäki and Väisänen, 1996; Talkkari 
  and Hypén, 1996). Based on model computations that assume a seasonally uniform 
  temperature increase, Proe et al. (1996) have suggested that growth of Picea 
  sitchensis in Scotland could increase by 2.8 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  for each 1°C rise in temperature. </p>
<p>In Russian boreal forests, some studies predict large shifts in distribution 
  (up to 19% area reduction) and productivity (e.g., Kondrashova and Kobak, 1996; 
  Krankina et al., 1997; Izrael, 1997; Raptsun, 1997). It could be concluded that 
  climate change and CO<sub>2</sub> increase would be favorable for northern forests 
  (e.g., as a result of increased regeneration capacity). Indeed, some studies 
  suggest a significant increase in productivity of forests in higher latitudes. 
  The largest changes are expected for forest tundra and the northern taiga, reaching 
  12-15% additional growth per 1°C warming (e.g., Karaban et al., 1993; Shvidenko 
  et al., 1996; Lelyakin et al., 1997). The same studies estimate the impact in 
  more southern forest zones (southern taiga, mixed and deciduous forests) to 
  be less: 3-8% per 1°C. </p>
<p>In central and southern Europe, limited moisture resulting from increasing 
  temperature and (possibly) reduced summer rainfall may generate productivity 
  declines regionally, but this cannot be predicted because of uncertain rainfall 
  scenarios. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment is likely to increase water-use 
  efficiency (WUE), which makes growth less drought-sensitive. Forest growth conditions 
  in the southern parts of eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Moldova) are likely 
  to decline as a result of increased drought, specifically in the steppe. Secondary 
  problems could arise in the protective shelterbelts in the south of the forest-steppe 
  zone that now covers about 3 Mha. </p>
<h4><a name="132212"></a>13.2.2.1.2. Disturbance regimes </h4>
<p>In the Mediterranean region, elevation of summer temperature and reduction 
  of precipitation may further increase fire risk. Colacino and Conte (1993a,b) 
  examined the pattern of forest fires in the Mediterranean region in connection 
  with the number of heat waves. An increase of 70% in the number of heat waves 
  was recorded in the period 1980-1985 with respect to the period 1970-1975, and 
  a similar increase was recorded in the extent of forest burned. In temperate 
  eastern Europe, forest fire increase is less likely, but very dry and warm years 
  could occur more frequently and promote pest and pathogen development. Large 
  areas of pine forests in Ukraine, Belarus, and central regions of Russia might 
  face some increased risk. </p>
<p>Increased forest fire risk is a crucial factor in the survival of boreal forests 
  in Russia. Most dangerous are large forest fires, which occur during extremely 
  dry and warm years. Such climatic conditions occur periodically (every 15-20 
  years) in parts of the Russian boreal zone. Currently these large fires account 
  for about 1-2% of the total number of forest fires, but burned areas reach 70-80% 
  and losses are as much as 90% of the total values. Most climate scenarios indicate 
  that the probability of large fires will increase. </p>
<p>Estimates of the possible influence of climate change on insect infestation 
  are uncertain because of complex interactions between forests, insects, and 
  climate. The probability of outbreaks of pests such as Dendrolimus sibirica 
  or Limantria dispar is expected to increase, especially in monocultures. Short-period 
  warming also could promote infestation with new pest species that presently 
  do not occur in the boreal zone. Increases of climate aridity would promote 
  occurrence of some diseases (e.g., root and stem fungi decays). </p>
<h4><a name="13222"></a>13.2.2.2. Grasslands and Rangelands </h4>
<p>Permanent grassland and heathland occupy a large proportion of the European 
  agricultural area. The type of grassland varies greatly, from grass and shrub 
  steppes in the Mediterranean region to moist heathland in western Europe. The 
  annual cycle of many temperate grasses is limited by low temperature during 
  the winter and spring and by water stress during the summer. Climate change 
  can affect the productivity and composition of grasslands in two ways: directly 
  through the effects of CO<sub>2</sub>, or indirectly through changes in temperature 
  and rainfall. Different species will differ in their responses to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and climate change, resulting in alterations in community structure (Jones and 
  Jongen, 1996). Legumes, which are frequent in these communities, may benefit 
  more from a CO<sub>2</sub> increase than nonfixing species (Schenk et al., 1995). 
</p>
<p>Intensively managed and nutrient-rich grasslands will respond positively to 
  the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and to rising temperature, as long 
  as water resources are sufficient (Thornley and Cannell, 1997). The direct effect 
  of doubling CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by itself may cause a 20-30% increase 
  in productivity in nutrient-rich grasslands (Jones et al., 1996; Cannell and 
  Thornley, 1998). The importance of water management (including drainage) may 
  be even more important, however, under changed climatic conditions in northern 
  Europe (Armstrong and Castle, 1992). This positive effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
  on biomass production and WUE can be offset by climate change, depending on 
  local climate and soil conditions (Topp and Doyle, 1996a; Riedo et al., 1999). 
  These effects also will determine the spatial distribution of agricultural grassland. 
  An analysis by Rounsevell et al. (1996a) showed that grassland production in 
  England and Wales is resilient to small perturbations in temperature and precipitation, 
  but larger temperature increases may cause drought stress and reduced suitability 
  for grassland production. </p>
<p>There is a greater controversy regarding the response of nitrogen-poor and 
  species-rich grassland communities. Experimental studies in such grasslands 
  have shown little response or even a reduction in production with CO<sub>2</sub> 
  enrichment (Körner, 1996). On the other hand, simulation studies have shown 
  that this could be just a transient response and that the long-term response 
  of nitrogen-poor grassland ecosystems may be relatively larger than that of 
  nitrogen-rich systems (Cannell and Thornley, 1998). This effect is caused by 
  a reduction in nutrient losses and an increase in nitrogen fixation at elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p>Because of its impacts on primary productivity and community structure, the 
  long-term effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on grasslands is an additional carbon 
  sink. By contrast, increasing temperatures alone are likely to turn grasslands 
  into a carbon source because soil respiration would be accelerated more than 
  NPP. The net effect of current scenarios for CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature 
  is likely to be a small carbon sink in European grasslands (Thornley and Cannell, 
  1997). </p>
<p>Arid and semi-arid environments (e.g., certain steppe-like habitats), which 
  are well represented in the Mediterranean area, are crucial for the preservation 
  of rich species diversity in this region. These regions seem to be the only 
  places within Europe that certain insect species, such as Lepidoptera, can inhabit 
  because of the abundant availability of their foodplants. Furthermore, the lack 
  of winter climatic stress makes arid lands quite suitable as wintering grounds 
  for birds. Overgrazing, fire, urbanization, and changes in land use can be considered 
  the main threats to these regions. The potential distribution of these semi-arid 
  environments may increase under drier and warmer climatic conditions, leading 
  to landscape fragmentation at the local scale and consequent local extinctions 
  (del Barrio and Moreno, 2000).</p>
