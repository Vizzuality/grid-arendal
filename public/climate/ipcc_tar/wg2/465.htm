<h1>12.1. The Australasian Region</h1>
<a name="1211"></a>
<h3>12.1.1. Overview</h3>
<p>Australasia is defined here as Australia, New Zealand, and their outlying tropical 
  and mid-latitude islands. Australia is a large, relatively flat continent reaching 
  from the tropics to mid-latitudes, with relatively nutrient-poor soils, a very 
  arid interior, and rainfall that varies substantially on seasonal, annual, and 
  decadal time scales, whereas New Zealand is much smaller, mountainous, and mostly 
  well-watered. The ecosystems of both countries contain a large proportion of 
  endemic species, reflecting their long evolutionary history and isolation from 
  other land masses. They have been subject to significant human influences, before 
  and after European settlement 200 years ago. </p>
<p>The region's climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding oceans. 
  Key climatic features include tropical cyclones and monsoons in northern Australia; 
  migratory mid-latitude storm systems in the south, including New Zealand; and 
  the ENSO phenomenon, which causes floods and prolonged droughts, especially 
  in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>The total land area is 8 million km<sup>2</sup>, and the population is approximately 
  22 million. Much of the region is very sparsely populated; most people (85%) 
  live in a relatively small number of coastal cities and towns. Both countries 
  have significant populations of indigenous peoples who generally have lower 
  economic and health status. The two countries have developed economies and are 
  members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); 
  unlike other OECD countries, however, their export trade is dominated by commodity-based 
  industries of agriculture and mining.</p>
<a name="1212"></a>
<h3>12.1.2. Previous Work</h3>
<p>The Australasian chapter (Basher et al., 1998) of the IPCC <i>Special Report 
  on Regional Impacts of Climate Change</i> (RICC) (IPCC, 1998) provides an extensive 
  assessment of likely climate change impacts and adaptation options for Australia 
  and New Zealand, based on work published until early 1998. That report concludes 
  that Australia's relatively low latitude makes it particularly vulnerable 
  through impacts on its scarce water resources and crops that presently are growing 
  near or above their optimum temperatures, whereas New Zealand&#151;a cooler, 
  wetter, mid-latitude country&#151;may gain some benefit from the ready availability 
  of suitable crops and a likely increase in agricultural production with regional 
  warming. Nevertheless, a wide range of situations in which vulnerability was 
  thought to be moderate to high were identified for both countries&#151;particularly 
  for ecosystems, hydrology, coastal zones, settlements and industry, and health. 
  Indirect local impacts from possible climatically driven changes in international 
  conditions&#151;notably commodity prices and international trade&#151;also was 
  identified as a major issue in the 1998 report, as well as by the New Zealand 
  Climate Change Programme (1990). Key points from Basher et al. (1998) follow.</p>
<p><i>Climate and Climate Trends:</i> Climate trends were reported to be consistent 
  with those in other parts of the world, with mean temperature increases of as 
  much as 0.1&deg;C per decade over the past century, a faster increase in nighttime 
  than daytime temperatures, and sea level rising an average of about 20 mm per 
  decade over the past 50 years. Increases in average rainfall and the frequency 
  of heavy rainfalls were reported for large areas of Australia. </p>
<p><i>Climate Scenarios:</i> Australian scenarios reported for 2030 exhibited 
  temperature increases of 0.3-1.4&deg;C, uncertain overall rainfall decrease 
  of as much as 10%, and more high-intensity rainfall events. Projected changes 
  for 2070 were about twice the 2030 changes. New Zealand projections included 
  similar temperature increases, as well as stronger westerly air flow, with resulting 
  precipitation increases in the west and decreases in the east.</p>
<p><i>Water Supply and Hydrology:</i> Possible overall reduction in runoff, with 
  changes in soil moisture and runoff varying considerably from place to place 
  but reaching as much as &plusmn;20%, was suggested for parts of Australia by 
  2030. Sharpened competition was expected among water users, with the large Murray-Darling 
  Basin river system facing strong constraints. Enhanced groundwater recharge 
  and dam-filling events were expected from more frequent high-rainfall events, 
  which also were expected to increase flooding, landslides, and erosion. A reduced 
  snow season was expected to decrease the viability of the ski industry, although 
  it would provide seasonally smoother hydroelectricity generation in New Zealand.</p>
<p><i>Ecosystems and Conservation:</i> Significant potential impacts identified 
  on Australasian land-based ecosystems included alteration in soil characteristics, 
  water and nutrient cycling, plant productivity, species interactions, and ecosystem 
  composition and function, exacerbated by any increases in fire occurrence and 
  insect outbreaks. Aquatic systems would be affected by changes in runoff, river 
  flow, and associated transport of nutrients, wastes, and sediments. These changes 
  and sea-level rise would affect estuaries and mangroves. Australia's coral 
  reefs were considered to be vulnerable to temperature-induced bleaching and 
  possibly to sea-level rise and weather change.</p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber:</i> Direct impacts on agriculture from CO<sub>2</sub> increases 
  and climate changes were expected to vary widely in space and time, with perhaps 
  beneficial effects early in the 21st century, followed by more detrimental effects 
  in parts of Australia as warming increases. Any changes in global production 
  and hence international food commodity prices would have major economic impacts. 
  The net impact on production forestry from changes in tree productivity, forest 
  operational conditions, weeds, disease, and wildfire incidence was not clear. 
  The impact on fisheries could not be confidently predicted.</p>
<p><i>Settlements and Industry:</i> Possible changes were noted in the frequency 
  and magnitude of climatic "natural disaster" events affecting economically 
  important infrastructure. Likely impacts of climate change were identified on 
  water and air quality, water supply and drainage, waste disposal, energy production, 
  transport operations, insurance, and tourism.</p>
<p><i>Human Health:</i> Increases were expected in heat-stress mortality (particularly 
  in Australia), the incidence of tropical vector-borne diseases such as dengue, 
  and urban pollution-related respiratory problems.</p>
<p><i>Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability:</i> Some of the region's ecosystems 
  were identified as very vulnerable, with fragmentation and alteration of landscape 
  by urban and agricultural development limiting natural adaptability. Land-use 
  management was the primary adaptation option identified. Although coral reefs 
  were identified as vulnerable, it was suggested that they might be able to keep 
  pace with sea-level rise.</p>
<p>Techniques that already provide considerable adaptability of agriculture to 
  existing climate variability may apply to climate change over the next few decades. 
  However, at longer time horizons the climate was expected to become less favorable 
  to agricultural production in Australia, leading to increased vulnerability. 
  Scientifically based integrated fisheries and coastal zone management were regarded 
  as principal adaptation options for fisheries.</p>
<p>Adaptation options identified for settlements and infrastructure included integrated 
  catchment management, changes to water pricing systems, water efficiency initiatives, 
  building or modifying engineering structures, relocation of buildings, and urban 
  planning and management. Low-lying coastal settlements were regarded as highly 
  vulnerable to high sea level and storm events. Adaptation options included integrated 
  coastal zone management (ICZM); redesign, rebuilding, or relocation of capital 
  assets; and protection of beaches and dunes. New Zealand is exposed to impacts 
  on its Pacific island territories, including the eventual possibility of having 
  to accept environmental refugees.</p>
<p>A moderate degree of vulnerability was identified for human health, with adaptation 
  responses including strengthening existing public health infrastructure and 
  meeting the needs of vulnerable groups such as isolated communities and the 
  poor.</p>
