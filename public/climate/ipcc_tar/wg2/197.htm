<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </h2>
<p>Ecosystems are subject to many pressures (e.g., land-use change, resource demands, 
  population changes); their extent and pattern of distribution is changing, and 
  landscapes are becoming more fragmented. Climate change constitutes an additional 
  pressure that could change or endanger ecosystems and the many goods and services 
  they provide. <br>
</p>
<p>There now is a substantial core of observational and experimental studies demonstrating 
  the link between climate and biological or physical processes in ecosystems 
  (e.g., shifting range boundaries, flowering time or migration times, ice break-up 
  on streams and rivers), most evident in high latitudes. Recent modeling studies 
  continue to show the potential for significant disruption of ecosystems under 
  climate change. Further development of simple correlative models that were available 
  at the time of the Second Assessment Report (SAR) point to areas where ecosystem 
  disruption and the potential for ecosystem migration are high. Observational 
  data and newer dynamic vegetation models linked to transient climate models 
  are refining the projections. However, the precise outcomes depend on processes 
  that are too subtle to be fully captured by current models. <br>
</p>
<p>At the time of the SAR, the interaction between elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 
  increasing temperatures, and soil moisture changes suggested a possible increase 
  in plant productivity through increased water-use efficiency (WUE). Recent results 
  suggest that the gains might be small under field conditions and could be further 
  reduced by human management activities. Many ecosystems are sensitive to the 
  frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other extreme events 
  that result in changes in productivity and disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, 
  pest and disease outbreak).<br>
</p>
<b>Agriculture </b> 
<p>Most global and regional economic studies&#151;with and without climate change&#151;indicate 
  that the downward trend in real commodity prices in the 20th century is likely 
  to continue into the 21st century, although confidence in these predictions 
  decreases farther into the future (see <a href="208.htm#531">Section 5.3.1</a>).</p>
<i>Impacts </i>
<ul>
  <li>Experiments have shown that relative enhancement of productivity caused 
    by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> usually is greater when temperature rises but may 
    be less for crop yields at above-optimal temperatures (established but incomplete). 
    Although the beneficial effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the yield of 
    crops are well established for the experimental conditions tested, this knowledge 
    is incomplete for numerous tropical crop species and for crops grown under 
    suboptimal conditions (low nutrients, weeds, pests and diseases). In experimental 
    work, grain and forage quality declines with CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and 
    higher temperatures (high confidence) (see Sections <a href="209.htm#533">5.3.3</a>, 
    <a href="220.htm">5.4.3</a>, and <a href="233.htm#553">5.5.3</a>).</li>
  <li>Experimental evidence suggests that relative enhancement of productivity 
    caused by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> usually is greater under drought conditions 
    than in wet soil. Nevertheless, a climate change-induced reduction in summer 
    soil moisture (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a>)&#151;which may 
    occur even in some cases of increased summer precipitation&#151;would have 
    detrimental effects on some of the major crops, especially in drought-prone 
    regions (medium confidence). </li>
  <li>Soil properties and processes&#151;including organic matter decomposition, 
    leaching, and soil water regimes&#151;will be influenced by temperature increase 
    (high confidence). Soil erosion and degradation are likely to aggravate the 
    detrimental effects of a rise in air temperature on crop yields. Climate change 
    may increase erosion in some regions, through heavy rainfall and through increased 
    windspeed (competing explanations) (see <a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>). 
  </li>
  <li>Model simulations of wheat growth indicate that greater variation in temperature 
    (change in frequency of extremes) under a changing climate reduces average 
    grain yield. Moreover, recent research emphasizes the importance of understanding 
    how variability interacts with changes in climate means in determining yields 
    (established but incomplete) (see <a href="213.htm#534">Section 5.3.4</a>).</li>
  <li>Crop modeling studies that compare equilibrium scenarios with transient 
    scenarios of climate change report significant yield differences. The few 
    studies that include comparable transient and equilibrium climate change scenarios 
    generally report greater yield loss with equilibrium climate change than with 
    the equivalent transient climate change. Even these few studies are plagued 
    with problems of inconsistency in methodologies, which make comparisons speculative 
    at this time (see <a href="213.htm#534">Section 5.3.4</a>). </li>
</ul>
<i>Adaptation and Vulnerability</i>
<ul>
  <li>Prospects for adaptation of plant material to increased air temperature 
    through traditional breeding and genetic modification appear promising (established 
    but incomplete). More research on possible adaptation of crop species to elevated 
    CO<sub>2</sub> is needed before more certain results can be presented (see 
    <a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>).</li>
  <li>Simulations without adaptation suggest more consistent yield losses from 
    climate change in tropical latitudes than temperate latitudes. Agronomic adaptation 
    abates extreme yield losses at all latitudes, but yields tend to remain beneath 
    baseline levels after adaptation more consistently in the tropics than in 
    temperate latitudes (moderate confidence) (see <a href="213.htm#534">Section 
    5.3.4</a>).</li>
  <li>The ability of livestock producers to adapt their herds to the physiological 
    stress of climate change is not known conclusively, in part because of a general 
    lack of experimentation and simulations of livestock adaptation to climate 
    change (see <a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>). </li>
  <li>Crop and livestock farmers who have sufficient access to capital and technologies 
    are expected to adapt their farming systems to climate change (medium to low 
    confidence) (see <a href="213.htm#534">Section 5.3.4</a>). Substantial shifts 
    in their mix of crops and livestock production may be necessary, however, 
    and considerable costs could be involved in this process&#151;<i>inter alia</i>, 
    in learning and gaining experience with different crops or if irrigation becomes 
    necessary. In some cases, a lack of water resulting from climate change might 
    mean that increased irrigation demands cannot be met (see <a href="191.htm#472">Section 
    4.7.2</a>). Although this conclusion is speculative because of lack of research, 
    it is intuitive that the costs of adaptation should depend critically on the 
    rate of climate change.</li>
  <li>mpacts of climate change on agriculture after adaptation are estimated to 
    result in small percentage changes in global income; these changes tend to 
    be positive for a moderate global warming, especially when the effects of 
    CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization are taken into account (low confidence) (see 
    <a href="216.htm">Section 5.3.5</a>). </li>
  <li>The effectiveness of adaptation in ameliorating the economic impacts of 
    climate change across regions will depend critically on regional resource 
    endowments. It appears that developed countries will fare better in adapting 
    to climate change; developing countries and countries in transition, especially 
    in the tropics and subtropics, will fare worse. This finding has particularly 
    significant implications for the distribution of impacts within developing 
    countries, as well as between more- and less-developed countries. These findings 
    provide evidence to support the hypothesis advanced in the SAR that climate 
    change is likely to have its greatest adverse impacts on areas where resource 
    endowments are poorest and the ability of farmers to respond and adapt is 
    most limited (medium confidence) (see <a href="216.htm">Section 5.3.5</a>).</li>
  <li>Degradation of soil and water resources is one of the major future challenges 
    for global agriculture (see <a href="209.htm">Section 5.3.2</a>). These processes 
    are likely to be intensified by adverse changes in temperature and precipitation. 
    Land use and management have been shown to have a greater impact on soil conditions 
    than the direct effects of climate change; thus, adaptation has the potential 
    to significantly mitigate these impacts (see <a href="213.htm#534">Section 
    5.3.4</a>). A critical research need is to assess whether resource degradation 
    will significantly increase the risks faced by vulnerable agricultural and 
    rural populations (see <a href="216.htm#536">Section 5.3.6</a>). </li>
  <li>It is concluded with low confidence that a global temperature rise of greater 
    than 2.5&deg;C will result in rising commodity prices. Similarly, a global 
    temperature rise of greater than 2.5&ordm;C increases by 80 million the absolute 
    number of people at risk of hunger. It should be noted, however, that these 
    hunger estimates are based on the assumption that food prices will rise with 
    climate change, which is highly uncertain (see <a href="216.htm#536">Section 
    5.3.6</a>).</li>
