<h4>5.3.6.2. Vulnerable Regions and Populations</h4>
<p>Although one may be reasonably optimistic about the prospects of adapting the 
  global agricultural production system to the early stages of warming, the distribution 
  of vulnerability among regions and people is likely to be uneven. As pointed 
  out in <a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>, in the tropics&#151;where some 
  crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance and where dryland, nonirrigated 
  agriculture predominates&#151;yields are likely to decrease with even small 
  amounts of climate change. The livelihoods of subsistence farmers and pastoral 
  people&#151;who make up a large proportion of rural populations in some regions, 
  particularly in the tropics, and who are weakly coupled to markets&#151;also 
  could be negatively affected. In regions where there is a likelihood of decreased 
  rainfall, agriculture could be substantially affected regardless of latitude. 
  However, regional economic analysis (see <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a>) 
  indicates that aggregate impacts on incomes even in the most vulnerable populations 
  may not be large.<br>
</p>
<p>Clearly, in addition to the foregoing generality on productivity, other features 
  of agricultural vulnerability are likely to vary widely among people, regions, 
  nations, and continents (see Chapters <a href="377.htm">10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). 
  As noted in several places in this section and elsewhere (Downing <i>et al</i>., 
  1996a), the poor&#151;especially those living in marginal environments&#151;will 
  be most vulnerable to climate-induced food insecurity. Parry <i>et al</i>. (1999) 
  assessed the consequences of climate change for the number of people at risk 
  of hunger as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1988) (see 
  <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a> for details of the study). By the 2080s, 
  the additional number of people at risk of hunger as a result of climate change 
  is estimated to be about 80 million. However, some regions (particularly in 
  the arid and subhumid tropics) may be affected more. Africa is projected to 
  experience marked reductions in yield, decreases in production, and increases 
  in the risk of hunger as a result of climate change. The continent can expect 
  to have 55-65 million extra people at risk of hunger by the 2080s under the 
  HadCM2 climate scenarios. Under the HadCM3 climate scenario, the effect is even 
  more severe, producing an estimated additional 70+ million people at risk of 
  hunger in Africa. It should be noted, however, that these hunger estimates are 
  based on the assumption that food prices will rise with climate change, which 
  (as noted above) is highly uncertain as far as 80 years into the future.<br>
</p>
<p>Who are these extra people at risk of hunger likely to be? Downing <i>et al</i>. (1996b) 
  suggest the following classes: rural smallholder producers, pastoralists, rural 
  wage laborers, urban poor, and refugees and displaced people. In addition, they 
  point to particular kinds of individuals: rural women, malnourished children, 
  handicapped and infirm people, and the elderly.<br>
