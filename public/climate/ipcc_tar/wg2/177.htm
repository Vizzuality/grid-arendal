<p><a name="fig43"></a><a href="175.htm#fig42">Figure 4-2</a> shows estimated 
  total water withdrawals, by sector, from 1900 to 1998 (Shiklomanov, 1998; Shiklomanov 
  et al., 2000). Agricultural use&#151;primarily for irrigation&#151;is by far 
  the largest proportion, accounting in 1995 for 67% of all withdrawals and 79% 
  of all water consumed. Municipal, or domestic, use represents only about 9% 
  of withdrawals. There are large differences, of course, between continents, 
  with the greatest absolute volume of irrgation withdrawals in Asia.</p>
<p>Over the past few years there have been many projections of future water withdrawals; 
  virtually all have overestimated the actual rate of increase (Shiklomanov, 1998). 
  <a href="175.htm#fig42">Figure 4-2 </a>also shows projected total global water 
  withdrawals estimates made for the UN Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater 
  Resources of the World (Raskin et al., 1997). The central projection represents 
  a &#147;Conventional Development Scenario&#148; (CDS), with &#147;best-guess&#148; 
  estimates of future population growth, economic development, and water-use intensity. 
  The upper and lower lines represent high and low cases, where the assumed rates 
  of growth are altered. Under the core CDS, global water withdrawals would increase 
  by about 35% over 1995 values by 2025, with low and high estimates of 23 and 
  49%, respectively. The greatest rates of growth are projected to be in Africa 
  and the Middle East, with the lowest growth in developed economies. These projections 
  are very dependent not only on the assumed rate of population growth but also 
  on the different assumed rates of water usage. They do not take potential climate 
  change into account.</p>
<p>The amount of municipal water withdrawals is dependent on the number of urban 
  dwellers, the level of development (related to the availability of a piped distribution 
  network and sewage systems, amongst other things), income levels, and price 
  where actually applied to water. Per capita withdrawals in many developed countries 
  are falling, and this may more than offset an increasing population: Total municipal 
  withdrawals in the United States, for example, are falling largely as a result 
  of increasing prices, conservation education provided by water utilities, and 
  increasing use of water-efficient appliances. However, municipal withdrawals 
  in developing countries can be expected to increase with living standards; under 
  the CDS, per capita withdrawals in these countries are projected to rise toward 
  those in more economically developed countries. Rapid urbanization in developing 
  countries is expected to lead to very substantial increases in total municipal 
  water withdrawals.</p>
<p>The industrial sector currently accounts for approximately 20% of current withdrawals. 
  This water is used primarily either in processing (food processing or heavy 
  industry) or for cooling; the relative proportions vary between countries. Future 
  industrial water use is expected to rise substantially as industrial development 
  continues, but the increase probably will be less than the increase in industrial 
  production as water is used with greater efficiency (using less per unit of 
  production, for example, or relocating power generation plants to coastal areas 
  to use seawater for cooling). Under the CDS, total industrial water use increases; 
  this increase is concentrated largely in Asia and Latin America (Raskin et al., 
  1997).</p>
<p>The amount of water used for agriculture is dependent primarily on the level 
  of irrigation development, the pricing of water, and the reliability of supply. 
  Future irrigation uses are a function of the rate of expansion of irrigated 
  land, irrigation efficiency, and pricing practices. Efficiency is projected 
  to improve&#151;partly as a result of changes in the cost of water and partly 
  as a result of technological developments&#151;but this may be more than offset 
  by increases in the area under irrigation. The amount of increase, however, 
  is very uncertain; it depends on, among other things, assumed rates of population 
  growth (increasing demand) and assumed changes in world agricultural markets. 
  Previous estimates of future water use have tended to overestimate the rate 
  of increase because the rate of expansion of irrigated land has been overestimated 
  (Shiklomanov, 1998). The expanded use of pricing to reflect water scarcity is 
  being strongly promoted by international organizations and will affect the quantities 
  used. However, many regions that historically have been dependent on rainfall 
  are using supplemental irrigation&#151;a factor that will increase irrigation 
  use.</p>
<p>Estimates of future water withdrawals are notoriously uncertain, largely reflecting 
  uncertainties in the future rate of population and economic growth. There is 
  an analogy here with GHG emissions scenarios. Also important, however, are possible 
  changes in the way water is priced. Much agricultural water, for example, currently 
  is heavily subsidized, and a shift toward a more &#147;economic&#148; price 
  for water is likely to have a very significant effect on use. The World Bank 
  and other economic development agencies are pushing for major reforms in the 
  way water is priced and sold, as well as the use of water markets as an efficient 
  way of reallocating existing supplies and motivating efficiency. </p>
