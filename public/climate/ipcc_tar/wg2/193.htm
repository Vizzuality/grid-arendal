<h2><a name="48"></a>4.8. Science and Information Needs</h2>
<h3><a name="481"></a>4.8.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>In the water sector, it is important to distinguish between the needs of those 
  who wish to estimate the potential magnitude of climate change impacts on hydrology 
  and water resources&#151;to meet IPCC concerns, for example&#151;and the more 
  pragmatic needs of water managers who need to consider how best to adapt to 
  climate change. The two sets of requirements are linked, but there are some 
  important differences in emphasis.</p>
<h3><a name="482"></a>4.8.2. Estimating Future Impacts of Climate Change</h3>
<p>Some climate change analysts are essentially concerned with estimating what 
  would actually happen under different climate futures: What are the impacts, 
  for example, of continued growth of emissions of GHGs at 1% yr <sup>-1</sup>  , and what would 
  be the impact of stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub>  concentrations at, say, 550 ppmv by 2150? How 
  do changes in variability affect the water environment? These impacts&#151;and 
  their costs&#151;then could be compared with the impacts, costs, and benefits 
  of mitigation. Such studies, in principle, could allow identification of &#147;dangerous&#148; 
  levels of climate change. There also are important science questions concerning 
  the processes by which climate change might impact the water environment. For 
  example, how might flow pathways through soils change? </p>
<p>Such research questions need developments in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creation of credible climate change scenarios. This involves improvements 
    to GCMs so that they simulate present climate and its multi-decadal variability 
    even better, development of conceptually sound downscaling techniques (in 
    the absence of high-resolution global climate models), and characterization 
    of potential changes in variability at time scales from daily to decadal. 
    These requirements are common to all impact sectors and (with the exception 
    of downscaling) are central to improving the understanding of climate change 
    in the most general sense.</li>
  <li>Characterization of natural climatic and hydrological variability. Potential 
    future climate changes resulting from increasing concentrations of GHGs need 
    to be placed in context by appreciation of &#147;natural&#148; climatic and 
    hydrological variability. Much needs to be learned about linkages between 
    different components of the climate system in different parts of the world, 
    which requires joint use of observational data (including remotely sensed 
    data), palaeoclimatic data, and model simulations. Palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological 
    reconstructions can provide very useful information on the variability in 
    &#147;natural&#148; hydrological systems, as well as insights into nonlinear 
    relationships between climate forcing and hydrological response. </li>
  <li>Improved hydrological models. Particularly important is development and 
    application of process-based models of hydrological processes that include 
    realistic representations of processes that generate streamflow and recharge 
    and determine water quality. Key issues include development of models that 
    do not need catchment calibration (but may require remotely sensed inputs) 
    to assess the effects of climate change in parts of the world with limited 
    hydrological data and development of coupled climate-hydrology models (which 
    also are important for the improvement of climate model performance and for 
    seasonal forecasting). The international collaborative research efforts summarized 
    in <a href="162.htm#422">Section 4.2.2</a> are extremely important.</li>
  <li>Characterization of uncertainty. How important are the different sources 
    of uncertainty&#151;in emissions, global climate response, and regional climate 
    change&#151; for estimated effects of climate change? Is downscaling cost-effective, 
    given the wide range of changes in climate that might result from different 
    emissions scenarios, for example? What can ensemble climate model experiments 
    contribute? There has been little systematic analysis to date of the relative 
    importance of different sources of uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Impacts on real-world water systems. <a href="179.htm">Section 4.5</a> notes 
    that there have been relatively few published studies on the impacts of climate 
    change on real-world water resources systems, and inferences about impacts 
    generally have been made from estimates of changes in streamflow alone. This 
    may give a very misleading impression of the actual impacts of change because 
    the characteristics of the water management system are a very important buffer 
    between hydrological effect and impact on users and the environment. Therefore, 
    more studies into real-world systems are needed.</li>
  <li>Effects of adaptation. Most impact studies have ignored adaptation by water 
    managers, and in opposition it often is asserted that water managers will 
    be able to adapt. However, how will managers make adaptation decisions in 
    practice on the basis of incomplete information, and what would be the effects 
    of inefficient adaptation on the impacts of climate change? </li>
</ul>
