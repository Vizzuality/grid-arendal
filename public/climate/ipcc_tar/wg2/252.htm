<h4>5.6.3.1.2. NPP and NEP </h4>
<p>Some modeled responses of forest ecosystems to climate change suggest that 
  forests could increase carbon storage during climate change (Xiao et al., 1997; 
  Prinn et al., 1999). However, recent work has provided new experimental evidence 
  on the response of vegetation uptake (NPP) and ecosystem losses (affecting both 
  NEP and NBP) to observed changes in climate over the past century. The net balance 
  between NPP (usually assumed to increase with warming, though this assumption 
  is challenged by data offered by Barber et al., 2000), heterotrophic respiration 
  (often assumed to increase with warming, though this is challenged, for example, 
  by Giardina and Ryan, 2000, and Liski et al., 1999&#151;at least for mineral 
  soil components) and disturbance releases (often ignored but shown&#151;for 
  example, by Kurz and Apps, 1999&#151;to be important in boreal estimates of 
  NBP) is no longer as clear as the SAR asserts. Present research continues to 
  improve scaling of localized responses (at the stand level, where increases 
  and decreases in NPP and NEP are observed) to the global scale. </p>
<p>Research reported since the SAR confirms the view that the largest and earliest 
  impacts induced by climate change are likely to occur in boreal forests, where 
  changes in weather-related disturbance regimes and nutrient cycling are primary 
  controls on productivity (Kasischke et al., 1995; Kurz et al., 1995; Yarie, 
  1999). The impacts are exacerbated by characteristic ecosystem time constants 
  (rotation length, mean residence time of SOM, etc.) that are long compared to 
  other forest ecosystems. In boreal forests, recent warming has been shown to 
  change seasonal thaw patterns (Goulden et al., 1998; Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 
  1999); increase growing season length (Keeling et al., 1996; Myneni et al., 
  1997); and, if accompanied by summer drought, reduce NPP (Sellers et al., 1997; 
  Barber et al., 2000). These trends are expected to continue on average (see 
  <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a>), although short-term modulations will 
  occur (e.g., in association with ENSO events) (Black et al., 2000). </p>
<p>The SAR (Kirschbaum et al., 1996) concludes that in lowland humid tropics, 
  temperatures already are close to optimum ranges for year-round growth. Hence, 
  an increase in temperature as a result of climate change is likely to have a 
  marginal effect on forest processes. However, research in a lowland tropical 
  forest in Costa Rica has shown that the annual growth in six major species of 
  this forest (with markedly different growth rates and life histories), over 
  a period of 13 years, was highly negatively correlated with annual mean minimum 
  (nighttime) temperatures (Clark and Clark, 1999). Although annual tree growth 
  varied among the six species, there was a highly significant interannual coherence 
  of growth among species.</p>
