<h4>3.3.2.3. Integrated Assessment Models</h4>
<p>Most scenarios applied in climate change impact assessments fail to account 
  satisfactorily for LUC-LCC. By incorporating land-use activities and land-cover 
  characteristics, it becomes feasible to obtain comprehensive estimates of carbon 
  fluxes and other GHG emissions, the role of terrestrial dynamics in the climate 
  system, and ecosystem vulnerability and mitigation potential. Currently, the 
  only tools for delivering this are IAMs (Weyant <i>et al</i>., 1996; Parson 
  and Fisher-Vanden, 1997; Rotmans and Dowlatabadi, 1998), but only a few successfully incorporate LUC-LCC, including Integrated 
  Climate Assessment Model (ICAM&#151;Brown and Rosenberg, 1999), Asian-Pacific 
  Integrated Model (AIM&#151;Matsuoka <i>et al</i>., 1995), Integrated Model for 
  the Assessment of the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE&#151;Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1998b), 
  and Tool to Assess Regional and Global Environmental and Health Targets for 
  Sustainability (TARGETS&#151;Rotmans and de Vries, 1997). These models simulate 
  interactions between global change and LUC-LCC at grid resolution (IMAGE, AIM) 
  or by regions (ICAM, TARGETS). All of these models, however, remain too coarse 
  for detailed regional applications.</p>
<p>LUC-LCC components of IAMs generally are ecosystem and crop models, which are 
  linked to economic models that specify changes in supply and demand of different 
  land-use products for different socioeconomic trends. The objectives of each 
  model differ, which has led to diverse approaches, each characterizing a specific 
  application.</p>
<p>ICAM, for example, uses an agricultural sector model, which integrates environmental 
  conditions, different crops, agricultural practices, and their interactions 
  (Brown and Rosenberg, 1999). This model is implemented for a set of typical 
  farms. Productivity improvements and management are explicitly simulated. Productivity 
  levels are extrapolated toward larger regions to parameterize the production 
  functions of the economic module. The model as a whole is linked to climate 
  change scenarios by means of a simple emissions and climate module. A major 
  advantage of ICAM is that adaptive capacity is included explicitly. Furthermore, 
  new crops, such as biomass energy, can be added easily. Land use-related emissions 
  do not result from the simulations. ICAM is used most effectively to assess 
  impacts but is less well suited for the development of comprehensive spatially 
  explicit LUC-LCC scenarios.</p>
<p>IMAGE uses a generic land-evaluation approach (Leemans and van den Born, 1994), 
  which determines the distribution and productivity of different crops on a 0.5&deg; 
  grid. Achievable yields are a fraction of potential yields, set through scenario-dependent 
  regional "management" factors. Changing regional demands for land-use 
  products are reconciled with achievable yields, inducing changes in land-cover 
  patterns. Agricultural expansion or intensification lead to deforestation or 
  afforestation. IMAGE simulates diverse LUC-LCC patterns, which define fluxes 
  of GHGs and some land-climate interactions. Changing crop/vegetation distributions 
  and productivity indicate impacts. Emerging land-use activities (Leemans <i>et 
  al</i>., 1996a,b) and carbon sequestration activities defined in the Kyoto Protocol, 
  which alter land-cover patterns, are included explicitly. This makes the model 
  very suitable for LUC-LCC scenario development but less so for impact and vulnerability 
  assessment because IMAGE does not explicitly address adaptive capacity.</p>
