<h4>5.6.2.2.2. Pressures from diseases and insect herbivory </h4>
<p>Insect outbreaks can be extremely important disturbance factors (Hall and Moody, 
  1994); during outbreaks, trees often are killed over vast areas (Hardy et al., 
  1986; Candau et al., 1998). Under climate change, damage patterns caused by 
  insects may change considerably, particularly those of insects whose temporal 
  and spatial distributions strongly depend on climatic factors. The ecological 
  interactions are complex, however (see <a href="#box510">Box 5-10</a>).</p>

        Southern Boreal Forests, Pests, Birds, and Climate Change</b> </div>
      <p>The eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is estimated to 
        defoliate approximately 2.3 Mha in the United States (Haack and Byler, 
        1993) and affects 51 million m<sup>3</sup> of timber in Canada annually 
        (Fleming and Volney, 1995). Although the budworm usually is present at 
        low densities, budworm densities can reach 22 million larvae ha<sup>-1</sup> 
        during periodic outbreaks (Crawford and Jennings, 1989). Outbreaks can 
        extend over 72 Mha and last for 5-15 years, killing most trees in 
        mature stands of balsam fir (Crawford and Jennings, 1989; Fleming and 
        Volney, 1995). </p>
      <p>Weather is thought to play a role in determining the budworm's range. 
        Outbreaks frequently follow droughts (Mattson and Haack, 1987) or start 
        after hot, dry summers (Fleming and Volney, 1995). Drought stresses host 
        trees and changes plant microhabitats (Mattson and Haack, 1987). Moreover, 
        the number of spruce budworm eggs laid at 25&deg;C is 50% greater than 
        the number laid at 15&deg;C (Jardine, 1994). In some areas, drought and 
        higher temperatures also shift the timing of reproduction in budworms 
        so that they may no longer be affected by some of their natural parasitoid 
        predators (Mattson and Haack, 1987). Weather, at least in central Canada, 
        also may play a role in stopping some outbreaks if late spring frosts 
        kill the tree's new growth on which the larvae feed.</p>
      <p>Control of some populations of eastern spruce budworm may be strongly 
        aided by bird predators, especially some of the wood warblers (Crawford 
        and Jennings, 1989; but see Royama, 1984). Birds can consume as much as 
        84% of budworm larvae and pupae when budworm populations are low (approximately 
        100,000 ha<sup>-1</sup>), but once larvae populations exceed 1,000,000 
        ha-1, bird predation is unable to substantially effect budworm populations. 
        This predatory action of birds works in concert with those of other predators, 
        mostly insects. </p>
      <p>The spruce budworm's northern range may shift northward with increasing 
        temperatures&#151;which, if accompanied by increased drought frequency, 
        could lead to outbreaks of increasing frequency and severity that lead 
        to dramatic ecological changes (Fleming and Volney, 1995). Increasing 
        temperatures also might reduce the frequency of late spring frosts in 
        southern boreal forests, perhaps increasing outbreak duration in some 
        of those areas. </p>
      <p>A changing climate also might decouple some budworm populations from 
        those of their parasitoid and avian predators (Mattson and Haack, 1987; 
        Price, 2000). Distributions of many of the warblers that feed on spruce 
        budworms could shift poleward, perhaps becoming extirpated from latitudes 
        below 50&deg;N (Price, 2000). Replacing biological control mechanisms 
        with chemical control mechanisms (e.g., pesticides) ultimately may yield 
        a different set of problems; there are economic and social issues relating 
        to large-scale pesticide application (see <a href="229.htm#5443">Section 
        5.4.4.3</a>).</p>

<p>In temperate and tropical regions, insect and disease outbreaks are reported 
  mostly for plantation forests; relatively less is known about native forests 
  (FAO, 1997a). In the boreal zone, insect-induced mortality was a significant 
  part of the changing disturbance regime for Canada in the period 1920-1995 
  (Kurz et al., 1995). Insect mortality accounted for the loss of approximately 
  76 Mha in that period, with a near tripling of the average annual rate after 
  1970 (Kurz and Apps, 1999). Similar trends have been observed for Russian forests, 
  where recent annual insect damage and disease mortality affecting as much as 
  4 Mha was reported by Shvidenko et al. (1995). In Siberian and Canadian forests, 
  insect damage is estimated to be of the same magnitude as fire loss (Krankina 
  et al., 1994; Fleming and Volney, 1995; Kurz et al., 1995; Shvidenko et al., 
  1995; Shvidenko, 2000). Changes in drought conditions appear to play an important 
  role in insect outbreaks (Volney, 1988; Sheingauz, 1989; Isaev, 1997).</p>
<p>There is likely to be an increase in declines and dieback syndromes (Manion, 
  1991) caused by changes in disease patterns, involving a variety of diseases. 
  For example, in temperate and boreal regions, there may be increased incidence 
  of canker diseases in poplars and other tree species. Some canker diseases increase 
  in severity with decreased bark moisture content brought on by drought (Bloomberg, 
  1962). As another example, Armillaria root disease is found throughout the world 
  and causes significant damage on all forested continents (Kile et al., 1991), 
  through mortality and growth loss. This disease&#151;one of the largest threats 
  to regeneration in the productive forest of the Pacific Northwest of North America&#151;has 
  surfaced as a result of past management practices (Filip, 1977) but may be exacerbated 
  by changing climate. Under present conditions, Armillaria root disease causes 
  losses of 2-3 million m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the forests of Canada's 
  Pacific Northwest (Morrison and Mallett, 1996). More recently, Mallet and Volney 
  (1999) report a 43% decrease in annual volume increment and a 23% loss in annual 
  height increment in lodgepole pine caused by Armillaria root disease. The incidence 
  of Armillaria root disease can be expected to change under warmer or drier conditions. 
  Significant damage has been observed in forests that have undergone drought 
  stress (Wargo and Harrington, 1991). Morevoer, in regions such as the Pacific 
  Northwest where the mean annual temperature presently is below the optimum (25&deg;C) 
  for Armillaria growth, a warmer climate is likely to result in increased root 
  disease and rate of spread. </p>
