<h3>14.2.5. Human Health</h3>
<p>Health impacts from climate change can arise via complex processes. The scale 
  of these effects would depend primarily on the size, density, and wealth of 
  human populations or communities (WHO, 1998). Extreme weather variability associated 
  with climate change may add new stress to developing nations that already are 
  vulnerable as a result of environmental degradation, resource depletion, overpopulation, 
  or location (McMichael <i>et al.,</i> 1996).</p>
<p>Persistent poverty and population pressure accompanied by inadequate sanitation 
  and inadequate public health infrastructure will limit many populations' 
  capacity to adapt (Kovats <i>et al.,</i> 1998; Patz, 1998). Interaction between 
  local environmental degradation and changes on a larger scale&#151;climate change, 
  population growth, and loss of biodiversity&#151;may significantly influence 
  effects on health (Haines and McMichael, 1997; WHO, 1998). The direct impacts 
  of climate change depend mainly on exposure to heat or cold waves or extreme 
  weather events, such as floods and droughts. </p>
<h4><a name="14251"></a>14.2.5.1. Effects of Changes in Climate Variables on Health 
</h4>
<p>Kattenberg <i>et al. </i>(1996) made generalized tentative assessments concerning 
  extreme weather and climate events. Studies in temperate and subtropical countries 
  have shown increases in daily death rates associated with extreme outdoor temperatures 
  (see <a href="528.htm">Section 14.1.5</a>; McMichael<i> et al.,</i> 1996). Climate 
  change scenarios constructed from three models have been used to estimate human 
  mortality with changes in baseline climate conditions for Buenos Aires, Caracas, 
  San Jos&eacute;, and Santiago. In Caracas and San Jos&eacute;, where present 
  temperatures are close to the comfort temperature for all months, mortality 
  rates (total, cardiovascular, and respiratory) increase for most of the climate 
  change scenarios employed. However, decreases in winter mortality may offset 
  excess summer mortality in cities with relatively colder climates, such as Santiago 
  (Martens, 1998). People who are more than 65 years old are more temperature 
  sensitive than younger people (Martens, 1998).</p>
<p>There is evidence that people living in poor housing conditions (crowded and 
  poorly ventilated) and urban populations in developing countries are particularly 
  vulnerable to thermal stress enhanced by rapid urbanization (urban heat island) 
  because of few social resources and low preexisting health status (Kilbourne, 
  1989; Martens, 1998). Furthermore, in rural areas, the relative importance of 
  temperature on mortality may be different from its effect on urban populations 
  (Martens, 1998).</p>
<p>Prolonged heat can enhance production of smog and dispersal of allergens. Both 
  effects have been linked to respiratory symptoms (Epstein, 2000). High temperatures 
  and air pollutants, especially particulates, act synergistically to influence 
  human health. This effect is occurring in large cities, such as Mexico City, 
  Santiago, and more recently Buenos Aires, where such conditions enhance the 
  formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., ozone&#151;Escudero, 1990; Katsouyanni 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1993; Canziani, 1994). Saldivia (1994, 1995) has observed an 
  increasing trend in the mortality of elderly people following peaks of air pollution 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo. Daily mortality has been correlated mainly with temperature 
  and ozone concentration, both measured the day before (Sartor <i>et al.,</i> 
  1995). Hyperthermic syndrome (heat stroke) affected children under 2 years old 
  and people over 80 in Peru's coastal regions during the high temperatures 
  of the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon (Instituto Nacional de Salud, 1998a, 1999).</p>
<p>During droughts, the risk of wildfires increases, causing loss of green areas, 
  property, livestock, and human life, as a result of increasing air pollution 
  from suspended particles (OPS, 1998). The direct effects of wildfires on human 
  health occur from burns and smoke inhalation (Kovats <i>et al.,</i> 1999). In 
  <i>Alta Floresta, </i>Brazil, there was a 20-fold increase in outpatient visits 
  for respiratory disease in 1997 during a biomass smoke episode (Brauer, 1998).</p>
<p>Increased ambient temperature may have significant effects on the distribution 
  and overgrowth of allergenic plants. Higher temperatures and lower rainfall 
  at the time of pollen dispersal are likely to result in higher concentrations 
  of airborne pollen during the peak season (Emberlin, 1994; Rosas <i>et al.,</i> 
  1989). A relationship between concentrations of algae and weather parameters 
  (temperature and vapor pressure) in Mexico has been correlated. Dispersion of 
  algae has received much attention during recent years as a result of associated 
  inhalant allergies and other respiratory disorders (Rosas <i>et al.,</i> 1989). 
  The high degree of seasonality (dry-rainy season) in air-borne enteric bacterial, 
  basidiomycete spore, particle, and protein concentrations also could be associated 
  with temperature and vapor pressure in Mexico City (Rosas <i>et al.,</i> 1994, 
  1995; Calder&oacute;n<i> et al., </i>1995). Thus, future changes in climatic 
  variables might have an important effect in the distribution of air-borne bacteria, 
  fungus, pollen, particles, and proteins whose allergenic properties have to 
  be considered.<br>
  In 1998, there was an increase in cholera cases in Peru and Ecuador and other 
  countries affected by weather disasters. Hurricane Mitch affected Guatemala 
  (the number of cholera cases increased four-fold), Belize, and Nicaragua (the 
  number of cholera cases was six times the usual number of reported cases) (OPS, 
  1999).</p>
<p>Global warming could increase the number and severity of extreme weather events, 
  such as storms, floods, droughts, and hurricanes, along with related landslides 
  and wildfires (IPCC, 1996). Such events tend to increase death and disease rates&#151;directly 
  through injuries or indirectly through infectious diseases brought about by 
  damage to agriculture and sanitary infrastructure and potable water supplies 
  (PAHO, 1998a). Floods and droughts could permanently or semi-permanently displace 
  entire populations in developing countries, leading to overcrowding and diseases 
  connected with it, such as tuberculosis and other air-borne and crowd diseases; 
  adverse psychological effects; and other stresses (IPCC, 1996; McMichael and 
  Kovats, 1998a,b; Epstein, 2000). Slums and shantytowns located on hills (e.g., 
  Rio de Janeiro), as well as human settlements located in flood-prone areas, 
  are particularly subject to periodic natural disasters that adversely affect 
  human health and sanitary infrastructure (IPCC, 1996).</p>
<p>In developing countries, populations are becoming more rather than less vulnerable 
  to disasters (McMichael and Kovats, 1998b). Natural disasters may be responsible 
  for outbreaks of cholera, leptospirosis, malaria, and dengue (Moreira, 1986; 
  PAHO, 1998a,b). Hurricane Mitch stalled over Central America in October 1998 
  for 3 days, claiming 11,000 lives. It was the most deadly hurricane to strike 
  the western hemisphere in 2 centuries (Hellin <i>et al., </i>1999). After Mitch, 
  Honduras reported thousands of cases of cholera, malaria, and dengue fever (PAHO, 
  1998a,b; OPS, 1999; Epstein, 2000). As the risk of flooding increases with climate 
  change, so does the importance of the major drainage system, which will determine 
  whether floodwaters drain in minutes, hours, or days (McMichael and Kovats, 
  1998b). Floodwaters can cause the release of dangerous chemicals from storage 
  and waste disposal sites and precipitate outbreaks of vector- and water-borne 
  diseases (Patz, 1998). </p>
<p>Indirect effects of disasters can damage the health care sector. After Hurricane 
  Mitch, some countries in Central America regressed decades in health services 
  and transport infrastructure, thereby making it more difficult to assist the 
  affected population (OPS, 1999). Environmental refugees could present the most 
  serious health consequences of climate change. Risks that stem from overcrowding 
  include virtually absent sanitation; scarcity of shelter, food, and safe water; 
  and heightened tensions&#151;potentially leading to social conflicts (Patz, 
  1998). Weather disasters cause many deaths and have long-term impacts on communities, 
  including psychological effects such as post-traumatic stress disorder (Kovats<i> 
  et al., </i>1998). In 1999, heavy rains on the coast of Venezuela displaced 
  80,000-100,000 people and caused 20,000-50,000 deaths, as well as 
  enormous damage in infrastructure (PNUD/CAF, 2000).</p>
