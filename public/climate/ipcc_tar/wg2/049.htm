<h1>6. Adaptation, Sustainable Development, and Equity </h1>
<p><i>Adaptation to climate change has the potential to substantially reduce many 
  of the adverse impacts of climate change and enhance beneficial impacts, though 
  neither without cost nor without leaving residual damage.</i> In natural systems, 
  adaptation is reactive, whereas in human systems it also can be anticipatory. 
  <a href="#figts9">Figure TS-9</a> presents types and examples of adaptation 
  to climate change. Experience with adaptation to climate variability and extremes 
  shows that in the private and public sectors there are constraints to achieving 
  the potential of adaptation. The adoption and effectiveness of private, or market-driven, 
  adaptations in sectors and regions are limited by other forces, institutional 
  conditions, and various sources of market failure. There is little evidence 
  to suggest that private adaptations will be employed to offset climate change 
  damages in natural environments. In some instances, adaptation measures may 
  have inadvertent consequences, including environmental damage. The ecological, 
  social, and economic costs of relying on reactive, autonomous adaptation to 
  the cumulative effects of climate change are substantial. Many of these costs 
  can be avoided through planned, anticipatory adaptation. Designed appropriately, 
  many adaptation strategies could provide multiple benefits in the near and longer 
  terms. However, there are limits on their implementation and effectiveness. 
  Enhancement of adaptive capacity reduces the vulnerability of sectors and regions 
  to climate change, including variability and extremes, and thereby promotes 
  sustainable development and equity. [<a href="645.htm#1824">18.2.4</a>, <a href="647.htm#1834">18.3.4</a>]</p>
<p>Planned anticipatory adaptation has the potential to reduce vulnerability and 
  realize opportunities associated with climate change, regardless of autonomous 
  adaptation. Adaptation facilitated by public agencies is an important part of 
  societal response to climate change. Implementation of adaptation policies, 
  programs, and measures usually will have immediate and future benefits. Adaptations 
  to current climate and climate-related risks (e.g., recurring droughts, storms, 
  floods, and other extremes) generally are consistent with adaptation to changing 
  and changed climatic conditions. Adaptation measures are likely to be implemented 
  only if they are consistent with or integrated with decisions or programs that 
  address nonclimatic stresses. Vulnerabilities associated with climate change 
  are rarely experienced independently of nonclimatic conditions. Impacts of climatic 
  stimuli are felt via economic or social stresses, and adaptations to climate 
  (by individuals, communities, and governments) are evaluated and undertaken 
  in light of these conditions. The costs of adaptation often are marginal to 
  other management or development costs. To be effective, climate change adaptation 
  must consider nonclimatic stresses and be consistent with existing policy criteria, 
  development objectives, and management structures. [<a href="647.htm#1835">18.3.5</a>, 
  <a href="648.htm#184">18.4</a>]</p>
<p>The key features of climate change for vulnerability and adaptation are related 
  to variability and extremes, not simply changed average conditions (<a href="#figts10">Figure 
  TS-10</a>). Societies and economies have been making adaptations to climate 
  for centuries. Most sectors, regions, and communities are reasonably adaptable 
  to changes in average conditions, particularly if the changes are gradual. However, 
  losses from climatic variations and extremes are substantial and, in some sectors, 
  increasing. These losses indicate that autonomous adaptation has not been sufficient 
  to offset damages associated with temporal variations in climatic conditions. 
  Communities therefore are more vulnerable and less adaptable to changes in the 
  frequency and/or magnitude of conditions other than average, especially extremes, 
  which are inherent in climate change. The degree to which future adaptations 
  are successful in offsetting adverse impacts of climate change will be determined 
  by success in adapting to climate change, variability, and extremes. [<a href="644.htm#1822">18.2.2</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="61"></a>6.1. Adaptive Capacity</h2>
<p><i>The capacity to adapt varies considerably among regions, countries, and 
  socioeconomic groups and will vary over time.</i> <a href="#tabts14">Table TS-14</a> 
  summarizes adaptation measures and capacities by sector, and <a href="#tabts15">Table 
  TS-15</a> provides this information for each region covered by the TAR. The 
  most vulnerable regions and communities are highly exposed to hazardous climate 
  change effects and have limited adaptive capacity. The ability to adapt and 
  cope with climate change impacts is a function of wealth, scientific and technical 
  knowledge, information, skills, infrastructure, institutions, and equity. Countries 
  with limited economic resources, low levels of technology, poor information 
  and skills, poor infrastructure, unstable or weak institutions, and inequitable 
  empowerment and access to resources have little capacity to adapt and are highly 
  vulnerable. Groups and regions with adaptive capacity that is limited along 
  any of these dimensions are more vulnerable to climate change damages, just 
  as they are more vulnerable to other stresses. [<a href="650.htm#185">18.5</a>,

    <td><i>Water Resources</i></td>
    <td>- Water managers have experience with adapting to change. Many techniques 
      exist to assess and implement adaptive options. However, the pervasiveness 
      of climate change may preclude some traditional adaptive strategies, and 
      available adaptations often are not used.<br>
      - Adaptation can involve management on the supply side (e.g., altering 
      infrastructure or institutional arrangements) and on the demand side (changing 
      demand or risk reduction). Numerous no-regret policies exist, which will 
      generate net social benefits regardless of climate change.<br>
      - Climate change is just one of numerous pressures facing water managers. 
      Nowhere are water management decisions taken solely to cope with climate 
      change, although it is increasingly considered for future resource management. 
      Some vulnerabilities are outside the conventional responsibility of water 
      managers.<br>
      - Estimates of the economic costs of climate change impacts on water 
      resources depend strongly on assumptions made about adaptation. Economically 
      optimum adaptation may be prevented by constraints associated with uncertainty, 
      institutions, and equity.<br>
      - Extreme events often are catalysts for change in water management, 
      by exposing vulnerabilities and raising awareness of climate risks. Climate 
      change modifies indicators of extremes and variability, complicating adaptation 
      decisions.<br>
      - Ability to adapt is affected by institutional capacity, wealth, management 
      philosophy, planning time scale, organizational and legal framework, technology, 
      and population mobility.<br>
      - Water managers need research and management tools aimed at adapting 
      to uncertainty and change, rather than improving climate scenarios.</td>

      ecosystems and biodiversity may be difficult or impossible.<br>
      - There is considerable capacity for adaptation in agriculture, including 
      crop changes and resource substitutions, but adaptation to evolving climate 
      change and interannual variability is uncertain.<br>
      - Adaptations in agriculture are possible, but they will not happen 
      without considerable transition costs and equilibrium (or residual) costs.<br>
      - Greater adverse impacts are expected in areas where resource endowments 
      are poorest and the ability of farmers to adapt is most limited.<br>
      - In many countries where rangelands are important, lack of infrastructure 
      and investment in resource management limit options for adaptation.<br>
      - Commercial forestry is adaptable, reflecting a history of long-term 
      management decisions under uncertainty. Adaptations are expected in land-use 
      management (species-selection silviculture) and product management (processing-marketing).<br>
      - Adaptation in developed countries will fare better, while developing 
      countries and countries in transition, especially in the tropics and subtropics, 
      will fare worse.</td>

    <td><i>Coastal Zones</i></td>
    <td>- Without adaptations, the consequences of global warming and sea-level 
      rise would be disastrous.<br>
      - Coastal adaptation entails more than just selecting one of the technical 
      options to respond to sea-level rise (strategies can aim to protect, accommodate, 
      or retreat). It is a complex and iterative process rather than a simple 
      choice.<br>
      - Adaptation options are more acceptable and effective when they are 
      incorporated into coastal zone management, disaster mitigation programs, 
      land-use planning, and sustainable development strategies.<br>
      - Adaptation choices will be conditioned by existing policies and development 
      objectives, requiring researchers and policymakers to work toward a commonly 
      acceptable framework for adaptation.<br>
      - The adaptive capacity of coastal systems to perturbations is related 
      to coastal resilience, which has morphological, ecological, and socioeconomic 
      components. Enhancing resilience&#151;including the technical, institutional, 
      economic, and cultural capability to cope with impacts&#151;is a particularly 
      appropriate adaptive strategy given future uncertainties and the desire 
      to maintain development opportunities.<br>
      - Coastal communities and marine-based economic sectors with low exposure 
      or high adaptive capacity will be least affected. Communities with lower 
      economic resources, poorer infrastructure, less-developed communications 
      and transportation systems, and weak social support systems have less access 
      to adaptation options and are more vulnerable.</td>

      means.<br>
      - Lack of financial resources, weak institutions, and inadequate or 
      inappropriate planning are major barriers to adaptation in human settlements.<br>
      - Successful environmental adaptation cannot occur without locally

      - Increasing risk could lead to a greater volume of traditional business 
      and development of new financial risk management products, but increased 
      variability of loss events would heighten actuarial uncertainty.<br>
      - Financial services firms have adaptability to external shocks, but 
      there is little evidence that climate change is being incorporated into 
      investment decisions. <br>
      - The adaptive capacity of the financial sector is influenced by regulatory 
      involvement, the ability of firms to withdraw from at-risk markets, and 
      fiscal policy regarding catastrophe reserves.<br>
      - Adaptation will involve changes in the roles of private and public 
      insurance. Changes in the timing, intensity, frequency, and/or spatial distribution 
      of climate-related losses will generate increased demand on already overburdened 
      government insurance and disaster assistance programs.<br>
      - Developing countries seeking to adapt in a timely manner face particular 
      difficulties, including limited availability of capital, poor access to 
      technology, and absence of government programs.<br>
      - Insurers' adaptations include raising prices, non-renewal of

      community, or personal levels.<br>
      - The most important and cost-effective adaptation measure is to rebuild 
      public health infrastructure&#151;which, in much of the world, has declined 
      in recent years. Many diseases and health problems that may be exacerbated 
      by climate change can be effectively prevented with adequate financial and 
      human public health resources, including training, surveillance and emergency 
      response, and prevention and control programs.<br>

      - Without adaptation, climate change will reduce the wildlife reserve

      - Adaptations already are required to deal with vulnerabilities associated 
      with climate variability, in human health, coastal settlements, infrastructure, 
      and food security. Resilience of most sectors in Asia to climate change 
      is very poor. Expansion of irrigation will be difficult and costly in many 
      countries.<br>
      - For many developing countries in Asia, climate change is only one 
      of a host of problems to deal with, including nearer term needs such as 
      hunger, water supply and pollution, and energy. Resources available for 
      adaptation to climate are limited. Adaptation responses are closely linked 
      to development activities, which should be considered in evaluating adaptation 
      options.<br>
      - Early signs of climate change already have been observed and may 
      become more prominent over 1 or 2 decades. If this time is not used to design 
      and implement adaptations, it may be too late to avoid upheavals. Long-term 
      adaptation requires anticipatory actions.<br>

<h2><a name="62"></a>6.2. Development, Sustainability, and Equity</h2>
<p><i>Activities required for enhancement of adaptive capacity are essentially 
  equivalent to those promoting sustainable development.</i> Enhancement of adaptive 
  capacity is a necessary condition for reducing vulnerability, particularly for 
  the most vulnerable regions, nations, and socioeconomic groups. Many sectors 
  and regions that are vulnerable to climate change also are under pressure from 
  forces such as population growth and resource depletion. Climate adaptation 
  and sustainability goals can be jointly advanced by changes in policies that 
  lessen pressure on resources, improve management of environmental risks, and 
  enhance adaptive capacity. Climate adaptation and equity goals can be jointly 
  pursued through initiatives that promote the welfare of the poorest members 
  of society&#151;for example, by improving food security, facilitating access 
  to safe water and health care, and providing shelter and access to other resources. 
  Development decisions, activities, and programs play important roles in modifying 
  the adaptive capacity of communities and regions, yet they tend not to take 
  into account risks associated with climate variability and change. Inclusion 
  of climatic risks in the design and implementation of development initiatives 
  is necessary to reduce vulnerability and enhance sustainability. [<a href="653.htm">18.6.1</a>]</p>
