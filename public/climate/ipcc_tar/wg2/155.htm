<h3>3.8.2. Implications of SRES Scenarios for Atmospheric Composition and Global 
  Climate<br>
</h3>
<p>Estimates of atmospheric composition resulting from the SRES emissions scenarios 
  are presented in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapters 3</a>-<a href="../wg1/160.htm">5</a>. 
  Information on CO<sub>2</sub> and ground-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations 
  is given in <a href="135.htm#tab32">Tables 3-2</a> and <a href="152.htm#tab39">3-9</a>. 
  More detailed regional estimates of pollutant concentrations and deposition 
  of acidifying compounds based on these scenarios also are beginning to emerge 
  (e.g., Mayerhofer <i>et al</i>., 2000; see <a href="136.htm">Section 3.4</a>). 
</p>
<p>To interpret the possible range of global temperature and sea-level response 
  to the SRES scenarios, estimates have been made with simple models for all 35 
  of the quantified SRES scenarios (<a href="152.htm#tab39">Table 3-9</a>; see 
  also <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="../wg1/408.htm">11</a>). 
  Estimates of global warming from 1990 to 2100 give a range of 1.4-5.8&deg;C&#151;somewhat 
  higher than the 0.7-3.5&deg;C of the SAR. The main reason for this increase 
  is that the levels of radiative forcing in the SRES scenarios are higher than 
  in the IS92a-f scenarios, primarily because of lower sulfate aerosol emissions, 
  especially after 2050. The temperature response also is calculated differently; 
  rather than using the conventional idealized, equilibrium climate sensitivity 
  range of 1.5-4.5&deg;C (IPCC, 1996a), the simple model is tuned to the 
  effective climate sensitivities of a sample of individual AOGCMs (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 9</a> for details). Sea-level rise between 
  1990 and 2100 is estimated to be 9-88 cm, which also accounts for uncertainties 
  in ice-melt parameters (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="383"></a>3.8.3. Implications of SRES Scenarios for Regional Mean 
  Climate </h3>
<h4><a name="3831"></a>3.8.3.1. Regional Information from AOGCMs</h4>
<p>Estimates of regional climate change to 2100 based on AOGCM experiments are 
  described in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapters 9</a> 
  and <a href="../wg1/373.htm">10</a>. The results of nine AOGCMs run with the A2 and 
  B2 SRES scenarios5 display many similarities with previous runs that assume 
  IS92a-type emissions, although there also are some regional differences (see 
  below). Overall, rates of warming are expected to be greater than the global 
  average over most land areas and most pronounced at high latitudes in winter. 
  As warming proceeds, northern hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent will 
  be reduced. Models indicate warming below the global average in the North Atlantic 
  and circumpolar southern ocean regions, as well as in southern and southeast 
  Asia and southern South America in June-August. Globally there will be 
  increases in average water vapor and precipitation. Regionally, December-February 
  precipitation is expected to increase over the northern extratropics and Antarctica 
  and over tropical Africa. Models also agree on a decrease in precipitation over 
  Central America and little change in southeast Asia. Precipitation in June-August 
  is projected to increase in high northern latitudes, Antarctica, and south Asia; 
  change little in southeast Asia; and decrease in Central America, Australia, 
  southern Africa, and the Mediterranean region.<br>
  <br>
  The main differences between the SRES-based and IS92-based runs concern greater 
  disagreement in the SRES runs on the magnitude of warming in some tropical and 
  southern hemisphere regions and differing intermodel agreement on the magnitude 
  of precipitation change in a few regions, possibly as a result of aerosol effects. 
  However, there are no cases in which the SRES and IS92a results indicate precipitation 
  changes of opposite direction (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="3832"></a>3.8.3.2. Regional Climate Characterizations</h4>
<p>Only a limited number of AOGCM results based on the SRES emissions scenarios 
  have been released and analyzed to date (i.e., results for the A2 and B2 scenarios), 
  and none were available for the impact studies assessed in this report. In the 
  meantime, alternative approaches have been used to gain an impression of possible 
  regional changes in climate across a wider range of emissions scenarios. One 
  method uses results from existing AOGCM simulations and scales the pattern of 
  modeled regional climate change up or down according to the range of global 
  temperature changes estimated by simple climate models for different emissions 
  scenarios or assumptions about climate sensitivity (Santer <i>et al</i>., 1990; 
  Mitchell <i>et al</i>., 1999; see also detailed discussion in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/474.htm">Chapter 13</a>). This "pattern-scaling" 
  method has been employed by Carter <i>et al</i>. (2000), using results from 
  simulations with seven AOGCMs, all assuming a radiative forcing approximating 
  the IS92a emissions scenario (for GHGs but excluding aerosols) scaled across 
  a range of global temperature changes estimated by using a simple climate model 
  for the four preliminary marker SRES emissions scenarios.</p>
<p>Regional-scale summary graphs of scaled temperature and precipitation changes 
  were constructed for 32 world regions, at subcontinental scale, chosen to represent 
  the regions being assessed by Working Group II (Carter <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Examples of individual plots are shown in <a href="153.htm#fig32">Figure 3-2</a>. 
  Changes are plotted alongside estimates of "natural" multi-decadal 
  variability of temperature and precipitation, extracted from two multi-century 
  unforced AOGCM simulations. The graphs thus provide a quick assessment of the 
  likely uncertainty range and significance of each AOGCM projection; they also 
  show the extent to which different AOGCMs agree or disagree with regard to regional 
  response to a given magnitude of global warming. Although a preliminary comparison 
  of these results with SRES AOGCM runs (which also include aerosol forcing) suggests 
  broad agreement on regional temperature and precipitation changes, more rigorous 
  comparison remains to be carried out, offering a useful test of the pattern-scaling 
  method.</p>
