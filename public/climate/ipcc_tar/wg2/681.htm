<h4>19.6.3.2. Large-Scale Singularities </h4>
<p>Singularities that occur in complex systems with multiple thresholds can be 
  assessed with appropriate models. In real systems, however, there always are 
  stochastic elements that influence the behavior of these systems, which are 
  difficult to model. The runaway greenhouse effect, for example, consists of 
  a series of positive feedback loops that result from systemic interactions or 
  can be triggered by stochastic events (Woodwell et al., 1998). <a href="#tab196">Table 
  19-6</a> lists examples of such singularities that are triggered by different 
  causes. All of these examples have regional or global consequences. The systemic 
  insights in their behavior generally are based on different simulation approaches. 
  Although local examples (e.g., species extinction) also are abundant in the 
  scientific literature, they are ignored here because climate change does not 
  (yet) seem to be the sole cause, and the processes involved generally are not 
  modeled systematically.</p>
<h4><a name="196321"></a>19.6.3.2.1. Nonlinear response of North Atlantic thermohaline 
  circulation</h4>
<p>Many model studies (reviewed in Weaver et al., 1993; Rahmstorf et al., 1996) 
  have analyzed the nonlinear response of the worldwide ocean circulation&#151;the 
  so-called conveyor belt. This system transports heat and influences regional 
  climate patterns. One component of this system is the current in the Atlantic 
  Ocean. Warm surface currents flow northward. Heat release and evaporation from 
  the ocean surface lowers the temperature and increases the density and salinity 
  of the water. In the North Atlantic, this denser water sinks at the Labrador 
  and Greenland convection sites and flows back south as deepwater. This so-called 
  North Atlantic THC could slow down or even shut down under climate change (see 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/260.htm">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="../wg1/338.htm">9</a>).</p>

<p>The paleoclimatic record shows clear evidence of rapid climatic fluctuations 
  in the North Atlantic region (with possible connections to other regions) during 
  the last glaciation and in the early Holocene (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> 
  <a href="../wg1/074.htm">Section 2.4.3</a>). At least some of these events&#151;notably 
  the Younger Dryas event, when postglacial warming was interrupted by a sudden 
  return to colder conditions within a few decades about 11,000 years ago&#151;are 
  thought to be caused by changes in the stability of North Atlantic waters. These 
  changes, which are recorded in the central Greenland ice cores and elsewhere, 
  were accompanied by large changes in pollen and other records of flora and fauna 
  in western Europe, indicating that they had widespread effects on European regional 
  climate and ecosystems (Ammann, 2000; Ammann et al., 2000). The likely cause 
  for these fluctuations is changes in the stability of the THC brought about 
  by an influx of freshwater from melting icebergs and/or ice caps (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/287.htm#737">Section 7.3.7</a>). As discussed in WGI, enhanced 
  greenhouse warming could produce similar changes in stability in the North Atlantic 
  because of warming and freshening of North Atlantic surface waters. </p>
<p>The current operation of THC is self-sustaining within limits that are defined 
  by specific thresholds. If these thresholds were exceeded, two responses would 
  be possible: shutdown of a regional component of the system or complete shutdown 
  of the THC. Both responses have been simulated. A complete shutdown was simulated 
  by Manabe and Stouffer (1993) for a quadrupling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and by Rahmstorf and Ganopolski (1999) for a transient peak in CO<sub>2</sub> 
  content. These studies suggest that the threat of such complete shutdown increases 
  beyond a global mean annual warming of 4-5&deg;C, but this is still speculative. 
  It took several centuries until the circulation was shut down completely in 
  both studies. A regional shutdown in the Labrador Sea (while the second major 
  Atlantic convection site in the Greenland Sea continued to operate) was simulated 
  by Wood et al. (1999). Simulated regional shutdown can occur early in the 21st 
  century and can happen rapidly&#151;in less than a decade. Simulations by Manabe 
  and Stouffer (1993) and Hirst (1999) show further the possibility of a shutdown 
  of the formation of Antarctic bottomwater, which is the second major deepwater 
  source of the world ocean.</p>
<p>These simulations clearly identify possible instability for the THC. Determining 
  appropriate threshold values, however, requires analysis of many scenarios with 
  different forcings and sensitivity studies of important model parameters. Stocker 
  and Schmittner (1997), for example, have shown that the THC is sensitive not 
  only to the final level of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration but also 
  to the rate of change. Rahmstorf and Ganopolski (1999) show that uncertainties 
  in the hydrological cycle are a prime reason for uncertainty in forecasting, 
  whether a threshold is crossed or not (see <a href="682.htm#fig196">Figure 19-6</a>). 
  Further parameters are climate sensitivity (high values increase the likelihood 
  of a circulation change) and the preindustrial rate of Atlantic overturning 
  (an already weak circulation is more liable to break down) (e.g., Schneider 
  and Thompson, 2000). These simulations suggest that global warming over the 
  next 100 years could lead to a sudden breakdown of the THC decades to centuries 
  later, which would lead irrevocably to major effects on future generations.</p>
<p>The possible impacts of these circulation changes have not yet been studied 
  systematically. Complete shutdown of the THC would represent a major change 
  in the heat budget of the northern hemisphere because this circulation currently 
  warms northwestern Europe by 5-10&deg;C (Manabe and Stouffer, 1988; Rahmstorf 
  and Ganopolski, 1999). Consequently, shutdown would lead to sudden reversal 
  of the warming trend in this region. The impacts of a regional shutdown would 
  be much smaller but probably still serious. For the European climate, loss of 
  the Greenland Sea branch probably would have a much stronger effect than loss 
  of the Labrador Sea branch because the northward extent of the warm North Atlantic 
  current depends mainly on the former. In either case, the consequences of circulation 
  changes for marine ecosystems and fisheries could be severe (see <a href="287.htm">Section 
  6.3</a>). Shutdown of the major deepwater sources in the North Atlantic and 
  Southern Ocean would lead to an almost stagnant deep ocean, with as-yet unexplored 
  consequences (e.g., for deepwater oxygen levels, carbon uptake, and marine ecosystems).</p>
<p>Neither the probability and timing of a major ocean circulation change nor 
  its impacts can be predicted with confidence yet, but such an event presents 
  a plausible, non-negligible risk. The change would be largely irreversible on 
  a time scale of centuries, the onset could be relatively sudden, and the damage 
  potential could be very high.</p>
<h4><a name="196322"></a>19.6.3.2.2. Disintegration of West Antarctic ice sheet 
</h4>
<p>The WAIS contains 3.8 million km<sup>3</sup> of ice, which, if released to 
  the ocean, would raise global sea level by 4-6 m. The WAIS has been the 
  subject of attention since analysis of paleodata (Hughes, 1973) and ice sheet 
  models (Weertman, 1974) predicted that such a marine-grounded ice sheet is inherently 
  unstable. </p>
<p>Analysis of ice sediments indicates that in the past 1.3 million years, the 
  WAIS has collapsed at least once (Scherer et al., 1998). It was inferred from 
  marine sediments that the WAIS is still dynamic. Since the last glacial maximum, 
  the grounding line (i.e., the boundary between the floating ice shelves and 
  the grounded ice) has retreated considerably (Hughes, 1998), and this process 
  continues. It probably reflects dynamics that were set in motion in the early 
  Holocene (Conway et al., 1999). This has important implications because it points 
  toward the long equilibration time scales involved in WAIS dynamics.</p>
<p>Fast-flowing ice streams, which feed the shelves from the interior, dominate 
  the discharge of the WAIS (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/429.htm">Section 
  11.5</a>). These ice flows are constrained at various boundaries. Whereas early 
  studies emphasized the role of ice-shelf boundaries in such ice flow, more recent 
  work points to the importance of different boundaries (i.e., the ice-stream 
  bed, the lateral margins, and the inland end&#151;Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; 
  Bell et al., 1998; Joughin et al., 1999; Payne, 1999). With respect to the time 
  scales of an eventual WAIS disintegration, this distinction is crucial because 
  the ice shelves respond to changes in climate within centuries, whereas the 
  conditions at the ice-stream margins and beds have response times on the order 
  of millennia (e.g., McAyeal, 1992). Whether proper incorporation of ice-stream 
  dynamics into ice-sheet models generally eliminates the presumed instability 
  cannot be conclusively resolved. McAyeal (1992), for example, incorporated ice-stream 
  dynamics and deformable bed conditions explicitly into his ice-sheet model and 
  showed that under periodic climate and sea-level forcing (100,000-year cycles), 
  the WAIS collapsed and regrew sporadically throughout a period of 1 million 
  years. </p>
<p>Even if accelerated loss of grounded ice were unlikely to occur over the 21st 
  century, changes in ice dynamics could result in increased outflow of ice into 
  the ice shelves and trigger a grounding-line retreat. An in-water temperature 
  of a few degrees Celsius could cause the demise of the WAIS ice shelves in a 
  few centuries and float its marine-based parts over a period of 1,000-2,000 
  years (Warner and Budd, 1998). This would produce a sea-level rise of 2-3 
  m. Huybrechts and de Wolde (1999) evaluate a climate change scenario that stabilizes 
  GHG concentrations at four times the present value in 2150. They show that melting 
  of the WAIS would contribute to 1-m sea-level rise by 2500&#151;a rate of rise 
  that would be sustained at 2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> for centuries thereafter. The 
  response of the Greenland ice sheet contributed to several meters of sea-level 
  rise by 3000. Even under this stabilization scenario, melting of the Greenland 
  ice sheet would be irreversible. Both studies, however, simply assume no change 
  in ocean circulation and an immediate warming of water in the sub-ice-shelf 
  cavity with a warming climate. Both assumptions still await full validation.</p>
<p>Global warming projected for the 21st century could set in motion an irreversible 
  melting of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, implying sustained sea-level 
  rise and irreversible losses. The impacts of complete disintegration of the 
  WAIS and subsequent sea-level rise by 4-6 m, however, have not been fully explored. 
  As summarized by Oppenheimer (1998), the disintegration time scales predicted 
  by models vary widely, between 400-500 years (Thomas et al., 1979) and 1,600-2,400 
  years (McAyeal, 1992). These time scales correspond to a mean contribution to 
  sea level of 10-15 and 2.5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Whereas an estimate 
  in the lower range is approximately equal to the present-day rate of sea-level 
  rise, a value in the middle to high range lies outside human experience and 
  would widely exceed the adaptive capacity of most coastal structures and ecosystems 
  (see <a href="667.htm">Sections 19.3</a> and <a href="297.htm">6.5</a>).</p>
