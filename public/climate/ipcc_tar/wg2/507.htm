<h3>13.2.5. Human Health </h3>
<p>Climate change will influence human health in several ways. Impacts will reflect 
  the conditions of the ecological and social environments in which humans live. 
  The impacts of projected changes in climate will depend on current and future 
  public health defenses. Difficult economic conditions during the past decade 
  have had serious implications for the delivery of health care and the public 
  health infrastructure in some countries in CEE. These countries are most at 
  risk from potential health impacts of climate change. </p>
<h4><a name="13251"></a>13.2.5.1. Thermal Stress and Air Pollution </h4>
<p>One can expect an increase in the frequency of heat waves, as well as warmer 
  summers and milder winters. Analyses in European cities show that total mortality 
  rises as summer temperatures increase (Katsouyanni et al., 1993; Kunst et al., 
  1993; Jendritzky et al., 1997). Episodes of extreme high temperatures (heat 
  waves) also have significant impacts on health. Heat waves in July 1976 and 
  July-August 1995 were associated with a 15% increase in mortality in greater 
  London (McMichael and Kovats, 1998; Rooney et al., 1998). A major heat wave 
  in July 1987 in Athens was associated with 2,000 excess deaths (Katsouyanni 
  et al., 1988, 1993). Much of the excess mortality attributable to heat waves 
  is from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease, and the elderly 
  are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illness and death (Faunt et al., 
  1995; Sartor et al., 1995). </p>
<p>In cold and temperate locations, daily deaths increase as daily wintertime 
  temperature decreases (Khaw, 1995; Laake and Sverre, 1996). Based on current 
  evidence, climate change (increase in mean winter temperatures) is likely to 
  result in a reduction in wintertime deaths, at least in temperate countries. 
  Langford and Bentham (1995) estimate that 9,000 wintertime deaths yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  could be avoided by the year 2025 in England and Wales under a 2.5°C increase 
  in average winter temperature. A meta-analysis by Martens (1997) estimates that 
  an increase in global temperature could result in a reduction in winter cardiovascular 
  mortality in Europe, leading to a decrease in mortality rates in regions with 
  cold/temperate climates. At this time, the literature does not enable quantitative 
  comparison between changes in summer and winter mortality. </p>
<p>Climate change also is likely to affect air quality in urban areas. Formation 
  (and destruction) of secondary air pollutants, such as ozone, increases at higher 
  temperatures and increased levels of sunlight. Studies in the United States 
  indicate that climate change would entail an increase in average ambient concentrations 
  of ozone and an increase in the frequency of ozone pollution "episodes" (USEPA, 
  1989). Experiments with the Hadley Centre climate model indicate significant 
  increases in baseline ozone concentrations in Europe. Ozone and other air pollutants 
  have significant impacts on health; these pollutants are considered to be one 
  of the most important environmental health problems in Europe. Finally, climate 
  change is likely to change the seasonality of pollen-related disorders such 
  as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) (Emberlin, 1994). </p>
<h4><a name="13252"></a>13.2.5.2. Vector-Borne Diseases </h4>
<p>Climate plays a dominant role in determining the distribution and abundance 
  of insects and tick species-directly, through its effects on vector and parasite 
  development, and indirectly through its effects on host plants and animals and 
  land-use changes (McMichael et al., 1996). Therefore, it is anticipated that 
  climate change will have an effect on the geographical range and seasonal activity 
  of vector species and, potentially, disease transmission (Bradley, 1993; Martens 
  et al., 1997; Martens, 1998). </p>
<p>As a result of deterioration of health systems, the recent resurgence of malaria 
  in eastern Europe is now a growing cause for concern. Climate change could exaggerate 
  this increased risk. In regions of southern Europe, climate change would increase 
  the current very small risk of local (autochthonous) transmission. A few such 
  cases are reported in the Mediterranean area under current climate conditions 
  (e.g., in Italy-Balderi et al., 1998). Concomitant with increases in the volume 
  of international travel, all countries in Europe have seen a steady increase 
  in the number of imported cases of malaria, which provide the source of the 
  pathogen (WHO, 1997). In the UK, however, local vectors are physiologically 
  unable to transmit the most lethal form of malaria (falciparum) (Marchant et 
  al., 1998). Although localized outbreaks are more likely to occur under climate 
  change, in northern and western Europe existing public health resources and 
  a lack of breeding habitats necessary to maintain high densities of mosquitoes 
  make re-emergent malaria unlikely. </p>
<p>Dengue currently is not present in Europe, although it has been present in 
  the past (Gratz and Knudsen, 1996). However, one of the vectors (Ae. albopictus) 
  currently is extending its range in Europe, and climate change could facilitate 
  this expansion (Knudsen et al., 1996). This vector has been reported in Italy 
  since 1990 and in Albania since 1979. </p>
<p>In all countries bordering the Mediterranean, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis 
  are transmitted to humans and dogs by phebotomine sandflies (Dedet et al., 1995). 
  Higher temperatures are likely to change the geographical distribution of the 
  important sandfly vector species and accelerate maturation of the protozoal 
  parasite, thereby increasing the risk of infection (Rioux et al., 1985). Increased 
  incidences of visceral leishmaniasis, unrelated to immune suppression, have 
  been reported from regions of Italy and coastal Croatia (Gabutti et al., 1998; 
  Punda-Polic et al., 1998). Several imported cases of canine leishmaniasis are 
  reported in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria every year (Gothe et al., 1997). 
  Thus, imported canine cases are a potential source of the pathogen, if the vectors 
  expand further north with climate change. </p>
<p>Ixodid ticks (e.g., Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus) are widely distributed 
  in temperate regions and transmit tick-borne diseases in Europe, of which Lyme 
  disease (Berglund et al., 1995) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are the most 
  important (Tälleklint and Jaenson, 1998). In Sweden, TBE incidence has increased 
  after milder winters, in combination with extended spring and autumn seasons 
  during 2 successive years (Lindgren, 1998). There also is some evidence that 
  the northern limit of the distribution of ticks in Sweden has moved northward 
  between 1980 and 1994 as a result of the increased frequency of milder winters 
  (Tälleklint and Jaenson, 1998; Lindgren et al., 2000). Climate change may extend 
  the length of the transmission season of tick-borne diseases and facilitate 
  spread to higher latitude and altitudes in northern Europe. However, a model-based 
  study indicates that overall the region suitable for TBE transmission may contract 
  significantly (Randolph and Rogers, 2001). </p>
<h4><a name="13253"></a>13.2.5.3. Water-Related Diseases </h4>
<p>Climate change could have a major impact on water resources and sanitation 
  in situations where water supply is effectively reduced. Some populations in 
  eastern Europe with restricted access to water in the home would be vulnerable 
  to any climate-related decreases in freshwater availability. Decreased water 
  availability also could lower the efficiency of local sewage systems and may 
  necessitate use of poorer quality sources of freshwater, such as rivers. All 
  of these factors could result in an increased incidence of water-borne diseases. 
</p>
<p>The most significant water-borne disease associated with the public water supply 
  in western Europe is cryptosporidiosis. Increases in the frequency or intensity 
  of extreme precipitation events can increase the risk of outbreaks of this disease. 
  Cases of cercarial dermatitis (water-based parasitic disease) may increase if 
  the climate becomes more favorable for the host-a water snail (de Gentile et 
  al., 1995). </p>
<h4> <a name="13254"></a>13.2.5.4. Food-Borne Diseases </h4>
<p>Warmer climate in combination with inappropriate food behavior may contribute 
  to increased incidences of food-borne diseases. A study of food-borne illness 
  in the UK found a strong relationship between incidence and temperature in the 
  month preceding the illness (Bentham and Langford, 1995). The distribution and 
  activity of flies, cockroaches, and rodents could change in response to climatic 
  changes. These species are carriers of food-borne pathogens and are considered 
  to be major hygienic pests in the domestic environment. </p>
<h4><a name="13255"></a>13.2.5.5. Health Implications of Floods </h4>
<p>The risk of flooding (coastal and riverine) is likely to increase in Europe 
  under climate change. With this risk comes additional risk to people's health 
  as a consequence of flooding (Menne et al., 1999). Some floods in Europe have 
  been associated with an increased risk of leptospirosis-for example, outbreaks 
  were reported following floods in Ukraine and the Czech Republic in 1997 (Kriz, 
  1998: Kriz et al., 1998) and in Portugal in 1967 (Simoes, 1969). Many cases 
  of post-flood food poisoning were noted during and after the Odra flood in 1997. 
</p>
<p>Some of the effects of flooding on mortality and ill health in developed countries 
  is attributable to the distress and psychological effects of the event (Bennett, 
  1970). This was demonstrated in the Easter 1998 flooding in parts of England 
  (the worst since 1947); the majority of flood victims interviewed cited stress 
  associated with the event and post-flood recovery as the worst aspect of their 
  experience (Tapsell and Tunstall, 2000). Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, 
  including 50 flood-linked suicides, were reported in the 2 months following 
  the major floods in Poland in 1997 (IFRC, 1998). The health effects of flooding 
  are complex and can result from a combination of factors. The impact of flooding 
  on mental health therefore may be significant. </p>
