<h2>8.6. Issues that are Related to Funding for Adaptation</h2>
<p>Although some discussion of adaptation appears in virtually all chapters of 
  the WGII report, <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a> addresses core concepts and 
  considerations. It states that key factors affecting the adaptive capacity of 
  a region or country include economic resources, technology, information and 
  skills, infrastructure, and institutions; it notes that there is considerable 
  variability among countries with regard to their ability to adapt to climate 
  change. However, Chapter 18 does not address specifics of how adaptation is 
  likely to be funded in developed and developing countries or how the need to 
  fund adaptation will affect the financial services sector.</p>
<p><a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a> also states that adaptive actions are most 
  likely to be implemented when they are components of or changes to existing 
  resource management or development programs (see World Bank, 1999). Klein (1998) 
  has suggested that investments for adaptation should essentially be incremental 
  to projects justified for other reasons, where a project has value even if climate 
  change were not to occur. When the impact of climate change is uncertain, this 
  is probably the best way to proceed. The financial sector would then play its 
  traditional role, and financial institutional arrangements would be the same 
  as for present-day investments in infrastructure. However, when projections 
  of climate are more certain and/or when the assets exposed are of high value 
  or when many people are at risk, dedicated additional climate change adaptation 
  investments may be required and special funding arrangements may be developed. 
  In these situations, new climate change-related financing schemes may emerge 
  whereby funds are generated through fees on emissions of greenhouse gases or 
  fees on trading of greenhouse gases. The Clean Development Mechanism developed 
  in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol is an example of the development of such 
  a financing arrangement. Such arrangements could generate new roles for the 
  financial sector.</p>
<p>An example of early cost estimates of measures meant to protect people and 
  properties against the risk of increasing rainfall, increasing river run-off, 
  and sea-level rise, using an integral approach, is the white paper of The Netherlands 
  National Committee on Water Management. This white paper projects the additional 
  cost of water management in The Netherlands, taking into account climate change 
  and long-term land subsidence and land-use changes. The paper concludes that 
  a budget of approximately US$2.5 billion is required for investments until 2015 
  and an additional US$8 billion for the 2015-2050 period to maintain adequate 
  safety levels for people and property (Netherlands National Committee on Water 
  Management, 2000).</p>
<p>Developing countries seeking to adapt in a timely manner face major needs, 
  including availability of capital and access to technology. Given the present 
  state of knowledge, many actions for adaptation are likely to be integrated 
  with and incremental to projects that already are occurring for other reasons. 
  The World Bank (1999) states that "there is no case to be made for &#145;stand-alone' 
  projects on adaptation to climate change." It also has noted that projects 
  for adaptation should be designed as incremental to projects that are justified 
  for economic development purposes. However, providing financing for projects 
  in developing countries is a complex matter. Even for projects for which the 
  risks and expected returns are commensurate with the requirements of the financial 
  markets, matching investors that have available funds with projects seeking 
  funding is by no means easy. Most simplistically, this process involves linking 
  investors with projects via appropriate sets of institutional and financial 
  intermediaries. The ability to do this successfully depends, in part, on the 
  level of development of financial markets and the financial services sector 
  in the country where the project will be implemented (World Bank, 1997b).</p>
<p>However, returns that can be expected from many prospective projects are not 
  sufficient for investors to assume the risks that they believe are inherent 
  in any individual project. This complicates the process further. If such projects 
  are going to be funded, some creative modification must be made to bring each 
  project's risk/return profile in line with the requirements of the financial 
  markets. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward, standardized means for 
  identifying and implementing needed changes. The process is guided in part by 
  the principle that risks should be assumed by the party best able to manage 
  them (IFC, 1996).</p>
<p>This need for financial resources for adaptation in developing countries is 
  addressed in the UNFCCC (or "Convention") and the Kyoto Protocol. 
  The Convention explicitly states that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Parties have responsibilities to make and implement plans for adapting 
    to any human-induced climate change.</li>
  <li>The developed countries shall assist developing countries in meeting the 
    costs of adapting to any adverse effects of such climate change.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both accords also address this notion more generally in identifying potential 
  actions to aid developing countries, including provision of "environmentally 
  sound" technology.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  In addition, the Protocol indicates that a portion of the proceeds from Clean 
  Development Mechanism (CDM) projects is to be used to meet the needs of "particularly 
  vulnerable" Parties for Adaptation<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  (UNFCCC, 1992, 1997). Taken together, provisions in these two accords provide 
  new sources of public sector funding for developing countries to implement adaptation 
  measures.</p>
<p>The Global Environment Facility (GEF), as the main focus of financial commitments 
  under the Convention thus far, has been the institutional mechanism for this 
  funding. GEF projects provide financial models for promoting technology diffusion 
  in developing countries, with some projects designed to mobilize private-sector 
  financing (UNFCCC, 1999). However, GEF activity generally has not addressed 
  the adaptation elements of the Convention. This lack of activity is driven by 
  internal requirements that GEF projects have global benefits, as well as directives 
  that such funding should cover only planning activities that are associated 
  with adaptation (Yamin, 1998). Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Climate 
  Change is one example of a GEF project that is addressing adaptation. This US$6.3 
  million project is focusing largely on planning and capacity-building needs 
  for addressing adaptation in the Caribbean (GEF, 1998).</p>
<p>However, there are still many issues to be addressed in connection with both 
  the Convention and the Protocol (Werksman, 1998; Yamin, 1998). Differing interpretations 
  of various provisions of the accords remain.</p>
<p>For example, detailed provisions of the CDM have yet to be worked out, including 
  those related to adaptation funding. One key issue is the size of the "set-aside" 
  from CDM projects that is dedicated to funding adaptation. If this set-aside 
  is too large, it will make otherwise viable mitigation projects uneconomic and 
  serve as a disincentive to undertake projects. This would be counterproductive 
  to the creation of a viable source of funding for adaptation. There also have 
  been no decisions on how these "set-aside" funds would be allocated 
  to adaptation projects. They could be used to fully fund projects or leveraged 
  to simply supplement other sources of funding. Any resulting allocation will 
  be driven by more technical and financial elements of the merits of alternative 
  projects, as well as political considerations of equity and fairness. As a result, 
  it may be some time before any of these provisions can produce a viable source 
  of funding for adaptation. An overview and analysis of the literature on climate 
  change policies and equity appears in Banuri et al. (1996). Linnerooth-Bayer 
  and Amendola (2000) propose that subsidized risk transfer can be an efficient 
  and equitable way for industrialized countries to assume partial responsibility 
  for increasing disaster losses in developing countries. Review of the literature 
  indicates that understanding of adaptation and the financial resources involved 
  is still in its early stages. As knowledge grows, the potential role(s) for 
  the financial sector will become clearer.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 8-4. Case Study: Bangladesh Flooding 1998</b> 
      <p>Bangladesh witnessed 35 cyclones from 1960 to 1991 (Haider <i>et al</i>., 
        1991) and seven major floods from 1974 to 1998 (Matin, 1998). The flood 
        of 1998 is considered to be one of the worst natural disasters experienced 
        by the country in the 20th century. It occurred from July 12 to September 
        14, a duration of 65 days (Choudhury, 1998). The flood affected about 
        100,000 km<sup>2</sup> (68% of the country's geographical area). 
        The numbers of affected families and population were more than 5,700,000 
        and 30,900,000, respectively (Choudhury, 1998). The flood caused 918 fatalities 
        and disease among 242,500 people. Approximately 1.3 Mha of standing crops 
        were fully or partially damaged. Total economic losses amounted to US$3.3 
        billion (8% of GDP, 1998 value), according to a study by Choudhury <i>et 
        al</i>. (1999). The study also shows that there is a wide discrepancy 
        between its estimates and estimates by other agencies, which is mainly 
        a result of coverage error.</p>
      <p>Generally, victims have to depend on their own resources to rehabilitate 
        themselves. During the emergency period, however, the government and NGOs 
        mobilized considerable financial resources to provide relief in the form 
        of food, clothing, and building materials.</p>
      <p>To reduce the damage from natural catastrophes, planned activities by 
        the government and NGOs (national and international) include construction 
        of an adequate number of cyclone shelters, embankments, and other shelters 
        in coastal areas, especially in the offshore islands.</p>
      <p>With regard to insurance against such calamities, there is not much available 
        except for the large industries and the commercial sector. Flood victims 
        were paid US$27.7 million as compensation by the insurance companies, 
        of which about 70% went to large industrial units. There was virtually 
        no insurance coverage for losses in the agricultural sector. Losses incurred 
        by shrimp farms and water transports, however, received sizeable compensation 
        by the insurance systems, according to government sources (Choudhury <i>et 
        al</i>., 1999).</p>
