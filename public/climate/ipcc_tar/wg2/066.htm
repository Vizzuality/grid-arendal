<h2>1.6. How can this Assessment be Used to Address Policy-Relevant Questions? 
  A Users' Guide </h2>
<h3><a name="161"></a>1.6.1. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
</h3>
<p>An important audience for this report is the UNFCCC Conference of Parties and 
  Subsidiary Bodies, through which implementation of the provisions of the Convention 
  (United Nations, 1992) and associated protocols will be negotiated. The major 
  issue is contained in Article 2 of the UNFCCC and relates to identifying the 
  level for stabilization of GHG concentrations. As stated in that Article, the 
  level for stabilization is set in terms of impacts of climate change. Hence, 
  the focus of this report is on identifying impacts potentially associated with 
  different rates and levels of climate change. It is important to reiterate that 
  readers will not find any magnitude or rate of climate change defined as "dangerous" 
  by this report. As noted earlier, this is because such a designation is necessarily 
  political for two important reasons. First, the impacts associated with any 
  given concentration target or emissions trajectory will be unevenly distributed 
  across countries, ecosystems, and socioeconomic sectors. Thus, some sectors 
  or regions may receive some benefit from a particular pattern of climate change, 
  whereas others will be harmed. It is not the role of the scientific community 
  to determine whether a particular pattern of impacts constitutes "dangerous" 
  interference; that is a political judgment to be negotiated among participating 
  governments and institutions. Second, there are scientific uncertainties associated 
  with climate change scenarios and our knowledge of impacts that may result. 
  Thus, it is not possible to state in absolute terms that particular impacts 
  will be associated with a given concentration target or stabilization pathway. 
  Instead, information about impacts will be conditional and is best considered 
  in a risk management framework-that is, different stabilization targets or pathways 
  pose different risks to food production, ecosystems, and economic development, 
  and such risks are likely to vary by region and over time. There is no way to 
  determine scientifically what level of risk is acceptable under the UNFCCC. 
  This, too, will be a matter for negotiation by governments. However, information 
  on the state of the science presented in IPCC assessments is widely believed 
  to help put such decisionmaking exercises on a firmer factual basis (see discussion 
  of guidelines for practitioners from an international social science assessment 
  of human choice and climate change in Rayner and Malone, 1998). </p>
<p>The TAR focuses on the vulnerability of different systems and regions to various 
  rates and magnitudes of climate change. Assessment of vulnerability and adaptation 
  is relevant not only to identifying impacts associated with different targets 
  but also to identifying "developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable 
  to the adverse effects of climate change" (Article 12; United Nations, 1997); 
  these countries are to be compensated from the proceeds of the CDM to help meet 
  the costs of adaptation. </p>
<h3><a name="162"></a>1.6.2. Links to Biodiversity Loss, Desertification, Deforestation 
  and Unsustainable Use of Forests, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, and Other Global 
  Environmental Issues </h3>
<p>Climate change is not an isolated issue; it is intimately connected to other 
  recognized natural hazards and global environmental problems. Separate international 
  conventions and processes exist to address these issues; in several cases, these 
  include successful scientific assessment mechanisms. This report contains information 
  of relevance to these bodies and processes, although it is not the intention 
  of the report to supercede or contradict information developed in those assessments. 
  The purpose of incorporating information of relevance to these issues is to 
  highlight scientific and policy links among them, so that unnecessary tradeoffs 
  can be avoided and potential multiple benefits can be realized (e.g., Orlando 
  and Smeardon, 1999; Kremen et al., 2000). For example, several international 
  conventions and agreements call for sustainable management and use of land and 
  water resources, with varying goals (such as enhancing GHG sinks and reservoirs, 
  protecting biological diversity, safeguarding aquatic ecosystems, managing forests 
  to meet human needs, and halting desertification). To the extent that these 
  objectives are potentially affected by climate change, and to the extent that 
  options to adapt to changing climate conditions can be structured to help attain 
  additional environmental or socioeconomic objectives associated with these other 
  agreements (i.e., co-benefits), this is highlighted in the relevant sections 
  of the TAR. </p>
<h3><a name="163"></a>1.6.3. Resource Planners, Managers in National and Regional 
  Institutions, and Actors in Specialized International Agencies </h3>
<p>Although the primary audiences of this report are involved in negotiating and 
  implementing the UNFCCC (United Nations, 1992) and, to some extent, other international 
  agreements on global environmental problems, the report also contains information 
  that is useful to resource managers in national governments; regional institutions 
  such as regional development or lending agencies; and specialized international 
  agencies such as the World Bank, UNEP, UNDP, or the GEF. In the chapters that 
  focus on sectors or systems of climate change (e.g., <a href="159.htm">Chapters 
  4</a>-<a href="347.htm">9</a>, which cover advances in our understanding of 
  impacts and adaptation options in water resources, agriculture, health, ecosystems, 
  and so forth), planners and managers in national ministries or regional planning 
  authorities will find information on how their mandates-such as encouraging 
  agriculture, providing freshwater, protecting endangered species, or increasing 
  energy production-could be affected by climate change. To the extent provided 
  in the literature, these chapters also include detailed technical and cost information 
  on adaptation options and factors that will influence their implementation. 
  In chapters that focus on regional analyses, managers and planners at regional 
  and international agencies will find information on baselines and trends (climate, 
  socioeconomic, and other environmental); each chapter also highlights particular 
  vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation that may occur in each region. 
  It is hoped that this information will be useful in assessing potential projects 
  and opportunities for investment, so that these can be structured to be more 
  robust to potential negative effects of climate change or to take advantage 
  of emerging opportunities. In addition, this report will be useful in the education 
  of the media and the general public about climate, the environment, and development 
  issues. </p>
