<h2>4.6. Insurance and Other Financial Services </h2>
<p>The financial services sector&#151;broadly defined as private and public institutions 
  that offer insurance and disaster relief, banking, and asset management services&#151;is 
  a unique indicator of potential socioeconomic impacts of climate change because 
  it is sensitive to climate change and it integrates effects on other sectors. 
  The sector is a key agent of adaptation (e.g., through support of building codes 
  and, to a limited extent, land-use planning), and financial services represent 
  risk-spreading mechanisms through which the costs of weather-related events 
  are distributed among other sectors and throughout society. However, insurance, 
  whether provided by public or private entities, also can encourage complacency 
  and maladaptation by fostering development in at-risk areas such as U.S. floodplains 
  or coastal zones. The effects of climate change on the financial services sector 
  are likely to manifest primarily through changes in spatial distribution, frequencies, 
  and intensities of extreme weather events (<a href="#tabts4">Table TS-4</a>).

<p><i>The costs of extreme weather events have exhibited a rapid upward trend 
  in recent decades.</i> Yearly global economic losses from large events increased 
  from US$3.9 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1950s to US$40 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  in the 1990s (all 1999 US$, uncorrected for purchasing power parity). Approximately 
  one-quarter of the losses occurred in developing countries. The insured portion 
  of these losses rose from a negligible level to US$9.2 billion annually during 
  the same period. Including events of all sizes doubles these loss totals (see 
  <a href="#figts5">Figure TS-5</a>). The costs of weather events have risen rapidly, 
  despite significant and increasing efforts at fortifying infrastructure and 
  enhancing disaster preparedness. These efforts dampen to an unknown degree the 
  observed rise in loss costs, although the literature attempting to separate 
  natural from human driving forces has not quantified this effect. As a measure 
  of increasing insurance industry vulnerability, the ratio of global property/casualty 
  insurance premiums to weather-related losses&#151;an important indicator of 
  adaptive capacity&#151;fell by a factor of three between 1985 and 1999. [<a href="327.htm">8.3</a>]</p>

      <b>Figure TS-5:</b> The costs of catastrophic weather events have exhibited

      to US$40 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1990s (all in 1999 US$). The insured 
      portion of these losses rose from a negligible level to US$9.2 billion annually 
      during the same period, and the ratio of premiums to catastrophe losses 
      fell by two-thirds. Notably, costs are larger by a factor of 2 when losses 
      from ordinary, noncatastrophic weather-related events are included. The 
      numbers generally include "captive" self-insurers but not the 
      less-formal types of self-insurance.</td>

</table>
<p><i><a name="figts5"></a>Part of the observed upward trend in historical disaster 
  losses is linked to socioeconomic factors&#151;such as population growth, increased 
  wealth, and urbanization in vulnerable areas&#151;and part is linked to climatic 
  factors such as observed changes in precipitation, flooding, and drought events.</i> 
  Precise attribution is complex, and there are differences in the balance of 
  these two causes by region and by type of event. Many of the observed trends 
  in weather-related losses are consistent with what would be expected under climate 
  change. Notably, the growth rate in human-induced and non-weather-related losses 
  has been far lower than that of weather-related events. [<a href="325.htm">8.2.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Recent history has shown that weather-related losses can stress insurance 
  companies to the point of impaired profitability, consumer price increases, 
  withdrawal of coverage, and elevated demand for publicly funded compensation 
  and relief.</i> Increased uncertainty will increase the vulnerability of the 
  insurance and government sectors and complicate adaptation and disaster relief 
  efforts under climate change. [<a href="327.htm">8.3</a>, <a href="579.htm">15.2.7</a>]</p>
<p><i>The financial services sector as a whole is expected to be able to cope 
  with the impacts of future climate change, although the historic record shows 
  that low-probability, high-impact events or multiple closely spaced events severely 
  affect parts of the sector</i>, especially if adaptive capacity happens to be 
  simultaneously depleted by nonclimate factors (e.g., adverse market conditions 
  that can deplete insurer loss reserves by eroding the value of securities and 
  other insurer assets). There is high confidence that climate change and anticipated 
  changes in weather-related events that are perceived to be linked to climate 
  change would increase actuarial uncertainty in risk assessment and thus in the 
  functioning of insurance markets. Such developments would place upward pressure 
  on premiums and/or could cause certain risks to be reclassified as uninsurable, 
  with subsequent withdrawal of coverage. This, in turn, would place increased 
  pressure on government-based insurance and relief systems, which already are 
  showing strain in many regions and are attempting to limit their exposures (e.g., 
  by raising deductibles and/or placing caps on maximum claims payable). </p>
<p>Trends toward increasing firm size, diversification, and integration of insurance 
  with other financial services, as well as improved tools to transfer risk, all 
  potentially contribute to robustness. However, the property/casualty insurance 
  and reinsurance segments have greater sensitivity, and individual companies 
  already have experienced catastrophe-related bankruptcies triggered by weather 
  events. Under some conditions and in some regions, the banking industry as a 
  provider of loans also may be vulnerable to climate change. In many cases, however, 
  the banking sector transfers risk back to insurers, who often purchase their 
  debt products. [<a href="327.htm">8.3</a>, <a href="337.htm">8.4</a>, <a href="579.htm">15.2.7</a>]</p>

  to climate change presents complex challenges, as well as opportunities, for 
  the financial services sector. Regulatory involvement in pricing, tax treatment 
  of reserves, and the (in)ability of firms to withdraw from at-risk markets are 
  examples of factors that influence the resilience of the sector. Management 
  of climate-related risk varies by country and region. Usually it is a mixture 
  of commercial and public arrangements and self-insurance. In the face of climate 
  change, the relative role of each can be expected to change. Some potential 
  response options offer co-benefits that support sustainable development and 
  climate change mitigation objectives (e.g., energy-efficiency measures that 
  also make buildings more resilient to natural disasters, in addition to helping 
  the sector adapt to climate changes). [<a href="334.htm">8.3.4</a>, <a href="338.htm">8.4.2</a>]</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are expected to be greatest in developing countries 
  (especially those that rely on primary production as a major source of income) 
  in terms of loss of life, effects on investment, and effects on the economy. 
  Damages from natural disasters have been as high as half of the gross domestic 
  product (GDP) in one case. Weather disasters set back development, particularly 
  when funds are redirected from development projects to disaster-recovery efforts. 
  [<a href="340.htm">8.5</a>]</p>
<p>Equity issues and development constraints would arise if weather-related risks 
  become uninsurable, insurance prices increase, or the availability of insurance 
  or financing becomes limited. Thus, increased uncertainty could constrain development. 
  Conversely, more extensive penetration of or access to insurance and disaster 
  preparedness/recovery resources would increase the ability of developing countries 
  to adapt to climate change. More widespread introduction of microfinancing schemes 
  and development banking also could be an effective mechanism to help developing 
  countries and communities adapt. [<a href="327.htm">8.3</a>]</p>
<p>This assessment of financial services has identified some areas of improved 
  knowledge and has corroborated and further augmented conclusions reached in 
  the SAR. It also has highlighted many areas where greater understanding is needed&#151; 
  in particular, better analysis of economic losses to determine their causation, 
  assessment of financial resources involved in dealing with climate change damage 
  and adaptation, evaluation of alternative methods to generate such resources, 
  deeper investigation of the sector's vulnerability and resilience to a range 
  of extreme weather event scenarios, and more research into how the sector (private 
  and public elements) could innovate to meet the potential increase in demand 
  for adaptation funding in developed and developing countries, to spread and 
  reduce risks from climate change. [<a href="345.htm">8.7</a>]</p>
