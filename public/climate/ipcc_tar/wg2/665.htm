<h4><a name="192232"></a>19.2.2.3.2. Marine ecosystems</h4>
<p>Evidence from marine ecosystems documents changes in species abundance and 
  diversity and spatial distributions associated with air and ocean temperature 
  rises (<a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="283.htm">6</a>). Several 
  studies document changes from the Antarctic region: Increases in chinstrap (Pygoscelis 
  antarctica) penguins, stability or slow declines in Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) 
  penguins, and declines in rockhopper penguins in recent decades are attributed 
  in part to differential responses to warming climate conditions that are altering 
  bird habitats (Fraser et al., 1992; Cunningham and Moors, 1994; Smith et al., 
  1999). Loeb et al. (1997) report effects on the Antarctic food web resulting 
  from decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development; krill 
  abundance is positively correlated with sea-ice extent, and salp abundance is 
  negatively correlated. Smith (1994) reports a significant and relatively rapid 
  increase in the numbers of individuals and populations of the only two native 
  Antarctic vascular plant species at two widely separated localities in the maritime 
  Antarctic.</p>
<p>Increases in abundance of southern macroinvertebrate species and declines in 
  northern species in a rocky intertidal community on the California coast are 
  consistent with recent climate warming (Sagarin et al., 1999). Warming annual 
  temperature has been suggested as a possible cause of increases in abundance 
  of plankton in the German Bight, but numerous factors, including regional eutrophication, 
  also have been noted (Greve et al., 1996). Lehman (2000) found that the distribution 
  of phytoplankton biomass in northern San Francisco Bay Estuary was influenced 
  by environmental conditions resulting from an interdecadal climate regime shift 
  between 1975 and 1993; precipitation regimes were primarily implicated, with 
  water temperatures also playing an important role. Ross et al. (1994) document 
  the loss of low-elevation pine forests in the Florida Keys because of rising 
  sea level.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="19224"></a>19.2.2.4. Socioeconomic Systems</h4>
<p>Evidence of observed impacts of regional climate changes from socioeconomic 
  systems is much sparser than from physical and biological systems, and methodologically 
  it is much more difficult to separate climate effects from other factors such 
  as technological change and economic development, given the complexities of 
  these systems. Vulnerability to climate change and climate variability is a 
  function of exposure and adaptive capacity (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>). 
  Exposure varies from region to region, sector to sector, and community to community, 
  and adaptive capacity may be even more variable. The adaptive capacity of socioeconomic 
  systems also contributes to the difficulty of documenting effects of regional 
  climate changes; observable effects may be adaptations to a climate change rather 
  than direct impacts. Evidence of observed adaptation of many of these systems 
  to multiple stresses, including climate variability, suggests that complexities 
  inherent in socioeconomic systems could be a source of resilience, with potential 
  for beneficial adaptations in some cases. Studies that have explored some of 
  these complex relationships are briefly reviewed in the following subsections, 
  but they are not included in the summary tabulation or figure.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="192241"></a>19.2.2.4.1. Agriculture and commercial fisheries</h4>
<p>It has been proposed that observed impacts of changes in regional climate warming 
  that are relevant to agriculture are related to increasing yield trends in Australia, 
  lengthening growing seasons at high latitudes, improved wine quality in California, 
  and expansion and advanced phenologies of agricultural pests. However, links 
  between changes in regional climate variables and such changes are hard to prove 
  because agriculture is a multifactored biophysical and socioeconomic system 
  (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). </p>
<p>Nicholls (1997) analyzed Australian wheat yields from 1952 to 1992 and concluded 
  that climate trends appear to be responsible for 30-50% of observed increases, 
  with increases in minimum temperatures (decreases in frosts) the dominant influence 
  (Nicholls, 1997); this conclusion has been questioned, however, by Godden et 
  al. (1998) and Gifford et al. (1998). Possible confounding socioeconomic factors 
  in identifying the effects of climate change on crop yields are responses of 
  farmers to growing conditions (e.g., farmers may increase fertilizer application 
  in good years, thereby exaggerating the impact of climate variables on yield), 
  technological progress, changes in market structure, and changes in agricultural 
  subsidies. Crop responses to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  also may affect yield trends.</p>
<p>Carter (1998) found that the growing season in the Nordic region (Iceland, 
  Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland) lengthened between 1890 and 1995 at all 
  sites except Iceland, with likely but undocumented impacts on crop phenologies 
  and timing of farm operations.</p>
<p>Nemani et al. (2001) relate warming at night and during spring in California 
  over the period 1951-1997 (especially since 1976) to improved vintage quantity 
  and quality.</p>
<p>Recent expansion and advances in insect phenologies may be associated with 
  regional increases in mean or minimum temperatures (e.g., advances in flight 
  phenology of aphid species in Britain) (Fleming and Tatchell, 1995; Zhou et 
  al., 1995). Such increases in insect pests may be contributing to agricultural 
  losses at least partially related to recent climate trends, but these effects 
  have not been examined analytically.</p>
<p>Some changes in marine and coastal ecosystems have links to commercial fisheries, 
  but it is difficult to separate regional climate effects from human use of fish 
  stocks (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>). Recent warming trends and coincident 
  overfishing and eutrophication have been noted in the English Channel and North 
  Sea, with potential future consequences for fish of high mass-market value (e.g., 
  haddock, cod, plaice, lemon-sole cod&#151;Southward et al., 1995; O'Brien et 
  al., 2000). Diminished krill supplies in the Antarctic associated with decreases 
  in annual sea-ice cover and warmer air temperature documented by Loeb et al. 
  (1997) between 1976 and 1996 may have long-term negative effects on upper tropic 
  levels, affecting commercial harvests. These observations, in part, have prompted 
  the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) 
  to request updated krill data currently used in krill management. CCAMLR manages 
  and sets limits on the international harvest of Antarctic krill (Loeb et al., 
  1997).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="192242"></a>19.2.2.4.2. Energy, industry, human settlements, and 
  financial and insurance services </h4>
<p>Associations between regional climate trends and impacts related to energy, 
  industry, and human settlements are sparse. One documented example is rapid 
  coastal retreat along ice-rich coasts of the Beaufort Sea in northwestern Canada 
  (Dallimore et al., 1996). Where communities are located in ice-rich terrain 
  along the shore, warmer temperatures combined with increased shoreline erosion 
  can have a very severe impact (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p>Determining the relationship between regional climate trends and impacts relating 
  to financial and insurance services is difficult because of concurrent changes 
  in population growth, economic development, and urbanization. Trends have been 
  analyzed regarding increased damages by flooding and droughts in some locations. 
  Global direct losses resulting from large weather-related disasters have increased 
  in recent decades (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). Socioeconomic factors 
  such as increased coverage against losses account for part of these trends; 
  in some regions, increases in floods, hailstorms, droughts, subsidence, and 
  wind-related events also may be partly responsible (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>). Attribution is still unclear, however, and there are regional differences 
  in the balance of these two causes. Hurricane and flood damages in the United 
  States have been studied by Changnon et al. (1997), Changnon (1998), and Pielke 
  and Downton (2001). Pielke and Downton (2001) found that increases in recent 
  decades in total flooding damage in the United States are related to climate 
  factors and societal factors: increased precipitation and increasing population 
  and wealth. Hurricane damages, on the other hand, are unaffected by observed 
  climate change (Changnon et al., 1997; Changnon, 1998).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="192243"></a>19.2.2.4.3. Human health</h4>
<p>There is little evidence that recent trends in regional climates have affected 
  health outcomes in human populations (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). 
  This could reflect a lack of such effects to date or difficulty in detecting 
  them against a noisy background containing other more potent influences on health 
  (Kovats et al., 1999). The causation of most human health disorders is multifactorial, 
  and the socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental context varies constantly. 
  With respect to infectious diseases, for example, no single epidemiological 
  study has clearly related recent climate trends to a particular disease. </p>
<p>Various studies of the correlation between interannual fluctuations in climatic 
  conditions and the occurrence of malaria, dengue, cholera, and several other 
  infectious diseases have been reported. Pascual et al. (2000) report a relationship 
  between cholera and El Ni&ntilde;o events. Such studies confirm the climate 
  sensitivity of many infectious diseases, but they do not provide quantitative 
  information about the impact of decadal-level climate change. Fingerprint studies 
  examine the patterns of collocated change in infectious diseases and their vectors 
  (if applicable) in simpler physical and ecological systems. This is an exercise 
  in pattern recognition across qualitatively different systems. </p>
<p>One example is the set of competing explanations for recent increases in malaria 
  in the highlands (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). A fingerprint study 
  has hypothesized possible connections of plant and insect data, glacier observations, 
  and temperature records to global climate change in high-altitude locations, 
  with implications for patterns of mosquito-borne diseases (Epstein et al., 1998). 
  Loevinsohn (1994) notes a connection between climate warming and increased rainfall 
  with increased malaria incidence in Rwanda, whereas Mouchet et al. (1998) emphasizes 
  the importance of nonwarming factors (e.g., land-use change in response to population 
  growth, climate variability related to ENSO) in explaining variations in malaria 
  in Africa. </p>
<p>Changes in disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks) are likely to be detected 
  before changes in human disease outcomes. Furthermore, a change in vector does 
  not necessarily entail an increase in health impacts because of simultaneous 
  processes related to the disease itself and the human population at risk. For 
  example, the presence or absence of sanitation systems, vaccination programs, 
  adequate nutritional conditions, animal husbandry, irrigation, and land-use 
  management influences whether the presence of a disease in wild vectors leads 
  to disease outbreaks in human populations. The effects of changes in frequency 
  of extreme events may entail changes in health impacts, but these have not been 
  documented to date. </p>
