<p><a name="fig161"></a>The most distinctive feature of polar regions is the large 
  seasonal variation in incoming solar radiation&#151;from very little in winter 
  to 24 hours of continuous sunlight in summer. Although the poles receive less 
  solar radiation annually than equatorial locations, near the time of the solstices 
  they receive more per day. The high albedo of the snow- and ice-covered polar 
  regions, together with the large loss of long-wave radiation through the very 
  clear and dry atmosphere, ensures a net loss of radiation in most months of 
  the year. These losses of radiation are particularly large during the long polar 
  night and help create a deep, stable boundary layer of very cold, dry air at 
  the surface.<br>
</p>
<p>These processes ensure sustained, very low temperatures in winter. Even in 
  the summer, many areas&#151;especially in the Antarctic&#151;remain below freezing. 
  Thus, much water remains frozen throughout the year. In Antarctica, snow and 
  ice have continued to accumulate on the continent for millions of years. On 
  the other hand, there are large volumes of liquid water in polar regions in 
  the Arctic and Southern Oceans, although their surface is partially covered 
  with sea ice, whose extent varies seasonally over vast areas. Sea ice insulates 
  the underlying water from heat loss and, because of its high albedo, reflects 
  much of the incoming solar radiation. <br>
</p>
<p>Formation of sea ice has important oceanographic consequences in that much 
  latent heat is released, and highly saline, dense water is created. The dense 
  water sinks in the north Atlantic and Southern Oceans, helping maintain the 
  ocean conveyor belt and carrying nutrients and carbon. Production of deep ocean 
  water is a consequence of processes that are operating in both polar regions. 
  There is little evaporation from the vast tracts of sea ice and glacier ice. 
  Extensive areas of the polar regions have very low precipitation; most comes 
  from cyclonic storms that penetrate from the surrounding belt of subpolar depressions.<br>
</p>
<p>The polar regions incorporate important environmental thresholds, many of which 
  are associated with water-phase changes. Together with the large seasonal changes 
  in solar radiation, polar regions stimulate important geophysical and biological 
  processes with high sensitivity to impacts. Sustained warming or cooling across 
  the freezing threshold brings dramatic physical changes over land and sea. As 
  a result, the physical environment, biota, and socioeconomic factors are all 
  vulnerable to climate change. The climate and vast areas of ice make the polar 
  regions very inhospitable and marginal for many species, including humans. However, 
  specially adapted species thrive in some terrestrial and marine polar ecosystems. 
  Consequently, the Arctic and Antarctic are characterized by the presence of 
  highly distinctive biomes and are important places for many migratory species. 
  Although the Antarctic continent essentially is a pristine wilderness, the great 
  whales and some species of seals in the Southern Ocean were commercially exploited 
  to virtual commercial extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries. Human activities 
  on many sub-Antarctic islands have altered their biota dramatically.<br>
</p>
<p>The Antarctic has limited resource use, apart from growing fishing and tourism 
  industries. There is a multinational approach to natural resources and environmental 
  management, with mineral exploration and exploitation banned by international 
  agreement. The area is managed by the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic 
  Treaty to the dedication of science and peace (UNEP, 1997). By contrast, the 
  Arctic has been populated for thousands of years. There is considerable economic 
  activity, based on fishing, herding, and shipping. Recent decades have seen 
  the establishment of urban areas and resource developments, based on the petroleum, 
  gas, and mining industries. The extreme environment requires unique cold-region 
  engineering and infrastructure solutions. There is a distinct contrast&#151;and 
  sometimes conflict&#151;between the developments of modern society and indigenous 
  peoples. The Arctic lies within the political boundaries of some of the world's 
  richest and most powerful nations. During the Cold War, it was a critical strategic 
  area, and substantial defense establishments remain in the region.</p>
<h3><a name="1613"></a>16.1.3. Climate Change in the 20th Century</h3>
<p>There has been substantial climate change during the past 2 million years in 
  the Arctic and the Antarctic. These changes are well documented in several natural 
  archives, such as ice cores and marine sediments. The quasi-periodic sequence 
  of glacial-interglacial periods and corresponding changes in GHGs is shown clearly 
  in the record of atmospheric composition and climate derived from the ice cores 
  for the past 420,000 years (e.g.,White and Steig, 1998; Petit <i>et al</i>., 
  1999). Longer term climate changes are not discussed in this chapter, which 
  focuses on observed 20th-century changes as well as those predicted for the 
  21st century. The following subsections provide a brief discussion of the main 
  climatic changes in the 20th century. More details are provided in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/048.htm">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
