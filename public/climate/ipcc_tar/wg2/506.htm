<h4>13.2.4.4. Tourism </h4>
<p>The tourist industry in Europe is expected to continue to grow, in part as 
  a result of higher incomes and more leisure time. Predominant tourist flows 
  presently are from north to south; at present these flows help to transfer capital. 
  Changes in recreational habits and preferences will lead to opportunities for 
  tourist investment in new areas, but existing major tourist flows to the Mediterranean 
  might be weakened if summer heat waves increase in frequency or if prolonged 
  droughts result in water supply problems and forest fires. Giles and Perry (1998) 
  have shown that summers as good as that of 1995 in northern Europe can lead 
  to a drop in the numbers of outbound tourists from countries such as the UK 
  to traditional Mediterranean sun destinations. </p>
<p>Changing demographic patterns-particularly an aging, wealthy population-may 
  lead to an increase in winter and shoulder season tourism to Mediterranean resorts 
  and expansion of retirement to attractive areas, particularly coasts. "Health 
  tourism" to spas and mountains is likely to increase in Europe. In northern 
  Europe, short breaks are likely to be taken over a longer season as temperatures 
  rise. </p>
<p>The coastal zone is the primary tourist resource of Europe, and associated 
  tourist infrastructure is at risk from sea-level rise, including unique tourist 
  attractions such as the city of Venice (Perry, 1999). Beaches, wetlands, and 
  estuaries also are tourist resources that are at risk. Already, many tourist 
  amenities, such as coastal golf courses and hotels, require protection. The 
  need to maintain coastal amenity values, as well as protect infrastructure, 
  is an important factor that is encouraging a shift from hard, rigid defenses 
  to softer approaches, including sediment management and nourishment (Penning-Rowsell 
  et al., 1992; Hamm et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Heat stress and poor urban air quality may render cities undesirable locations 
  in summer, with more tourist traffic to the country and the coast. Outdoor recreational 
  spending is likely to increase. </p>
<p>Mountainous zones are used extensively for recreation and are the main sites 
  of the European winter sports industry, which is based on snow resources that 
  are vulnerable to climate change. Mohnl (1996) has shown that there is a statistically 
  significant trend in snow-cover reduction in the Alps over recent years. Abegg 
  and Froesch (1994) have suggested that assuming a 3°C rise in mean temperatures, 
  the snow line in winter will rise by 300 m in the central Alps, the first snowfall 
  of the season will be delayed, and below an altitude of 1,200 m there will not 
  be continuous winter snow cover. As the season contracts, there will be a need 
  to bolster winter tourism with increased use of artificial snow and more alternatives 
  to outdoor skiing. In Scotland, the skiing industry is likely to experience 
  more frequent snow-deficient winters, with adverse impacts on the financial 
  viability of the industry. </p>
<p>Jaagus (1997) analyzed the impact of climate change on the snow-cover pattern 
  in Estonia, where snow cover is important for winter sports and tourism. Indications 
  are that a considerable drop in snow-cover duration will take place on islands 
  and in the coastal region of west Estonia. </p>
<h4> <a name="13245"></a>13.2.4.5. Migrations </h4>
<p>Migration caused by soil degradation is a very important issue in the Mediterranean 
  region, the southern part of which is mostly arid and vulnerable to climate 
  change. With perhaps 24% of total drylands in Africa in the process of desertification 
  and 0.3% of the African population permanently displaced largely as a result 
  of environmental degradation (LeHouerou, 1992), consequent in-migration pressures 
  on neighboring regions such as southern Europe can be substantial (Goria, 1999).
