<h3>19.5.4. Sensitivity of Aggregate Estimates </h3>
<p>At a time when the quality of numerical results still is low, a key benefit 
  of aggregate impact analysis lies in the insights it provides regarding the 
  sensitivity of impacts. Sensitivity analysis offers critical information about 
  attributes of the damage function that are likely to be most influential for 
  the choice of policy and, by implication, where additional climate change impacts 
  research is most needed.</p>
<h4><a name="19541"></a>19.5.4.1. Composition of Impact Function</h4>

      <b>Figure 19-5: </b>Aggregate impact of climate change as a function of 
      global mean temperature. Displayed are hypothetical examples of a linear 
      function, which assumes that impacts are proportional to temperature change 
      since preindustrial times; a cubic function, which assumes that impacts 
      are proportional to temperature change to the power of three; and a hockey-stick 
      function, which assumes that impacts are approximately proportional to temperature 
      change until a critical threshold is approached. Aggregate damage functions 
      used in integrated assessments are mostly illustrative. They should be regarded 
      as "placeholders" that will be replaced by more accurate functional 
      forms as our knowledge of impact dynamics improves. </td>

<p><a name="fig195"></a>Most aggregate analysis is based on IAMs (see <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Impact functions used in IAMs vary greatly with respect to the level 
  of modeling sophistication, the degree of regional aggregation, the choice of 
  numeraire, and other characteristics (see Tol and Fankhauser, 1998). Many models 
  have used monetary terms (e.g., U.S. dollars) to measure impacts. Spatially 
  detailed models (e.g., Alcamo et al., 1998) pay some attention to unique ecosystems. 
  Disruptive climate changes have received little attention, except for a survey 
  of expert opinions (Nordhaus, 1994b) and analytical work (e.g., Gjerde et al., 
  1999). Some climate change impact studies restrict themselves to sectors and 
  countries that are relatively well studied (e.g., Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999). 
  Others try to be comprehensive, despite the additional uncertainties (e.g., 
  Hohmeyer and Gaertner, 1992). Some studies rely on an aggregate description 
  of all climate change impacts for the world as a whole (e.g., Nordhaus, 1994a). 
  Other studies disaggregate impacts with substantial spatial and regional detail 
  (e.g., Alcamo et al., 1998). The aggregate approaches tend to point out implications 
  for efficiency and in practice often ignore equity (see Tol, 2001a, for an exception). 
  The detailed approaches tend to identify distributional issues, but working 
  out the equity implications typically is left to the reader.</p>
<h4><a name="19542"></a>19.5.4.2. Shape of Damage Function</h4>
<p>Most impact studies still look at the equilibrium effect of one particular 
  level of GHG concentration, usually 2xCO<sub>2</sub>. Full analysis, however, 
  requires impacts to be expressed as a function of change in GHG concentrations. 
  With so little information to estimate this function, studies have to rely on 
  sensitivity analyses. Different damage functions can lead to profoundly different 
  policy recommendations. Compare, for example, the profile of impacts under a 
  linear and a cubic damage function (see <a href="#fig195">Figure 19-5</a>). 
  Relative to the linear specification, a cubic function implies low near-term 
  impacts but rapidly increasing impacts further in the future. Using conventional 
  discounting, this means that early emissions under a cubic damage function will 
  cause less damage over their atmospheric lifetime, compared to a scenario with 
  linear damages. The marginal damage caused by emissions further in the future, 
  on the other hand, is much higher if we assume a cubic damage function (Peck 
  and Teisberg, 1994). </p>
<p>Some studies explore the implications of more nonlinear impact functions. For 
  instance, Manne and Richels (1995) use a "hockey-stick" function that 
  suddenly turns upward at arbitrarily chosen thresholds. Such studies are designed 
  to reflect relatively small impacts before 2xCO<sub>2</sub> and rapidly worsening 
  impacts beyond 2xCO<sub>2</sub>. In this analysis, it is economically efficient 
  to stabilize CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, but the desired level of stabilization 
  depends on the shape of the hockey stick and the location of its kink. Other 
  analyses, which rely on more linear impact functions, have difficulty justifying 
  concentration stabilization at any level.</p>
<h4><a name="19543"></a>19.5.4.3. Rate of Change</h4>
<p>Although most impact studies focus on the level of climate change, the rate 
  of climate change generally is believed to be an important determinant, in many 
  instances because it affects the time that is available for adaptation. Again, 
  the paucity of underlying impact studies forces integrated assessors to use 
  exploratory modeling. Under most "business-as-usual" scenarios, the 
  rate of climate change is greater in the short run than in the long run because 
  emissions increase faster in the short run; this is even more pronounced in 
  emission reduction policy scenarios. Indeed, in considering the rate of change, 
  tolerable window and safe-landing analyses (Alcamo and Kreileman, 1996; Toth 
  et al., 1997; Petschel-Held et al., 1999) often find the rate of change to be 
  the binding constraint in the first half of the 21st century.</p>
<h4><a name="19544"></a>19.5.4.4. Discount Rate and Time Horizon</h4>
<p>Aggregate models suggest that the most severe impacts of climate change will 
  occur further in the future. The chance of large-scale discontinuities (thermohaline 
  circulation, West Antarctic ice sheet) also is higher in the future. The outcome 
  of policy analysis therefore is sensitive to the weight afforded to events occurring 
  in the remote future. In other words, estimates are sensitive to the choice 
  of time horizon (Cline, 1992; Azar and Sterner, 1996; Hasselmann et al., 1997) 
  and the discount rate (i.e., the value of future consumption relative to today's 
  value). The literature on discounting is reviewed in Portney and Weyant (1999) 
  and in <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/266.htm">Chapter 7</a>. Numerical 
  analysis (e.g., Tol, 1999a) has shown that estimates of marginal damage ( i.e., 
  the additional damage caused by an extra ton of emissions) can vary by as much 
  as a factor of 10 for different (and reasonable) assumptions about the discount 
  rate. This makes the discount rate the second-most important parameter for marginal 
  damage. The most important parameter is the degree of cooperation in reducing 
  emissions (Nordhaus and Yang, 1996; Tol, 1999b).</p>
<h4><a name="19545"></a>19.5.4.5. Welfare Criteria</h4>
<p>Comparison of impacts (i.e., the relative weight assigned to impacts in different 
  regions and at different times) is one of the most sensitive aspects of aggregate 
  analysis. With the exception of the discount rate, little explicit attention 
  is paid to this aspect of climate change impacts, although studies differ considerably 
  in their implicit assumptions. Fankhauser et al. (1997) and Azar (1999) are 
  among the few studies that make their aggregation assumptions explicit. They 
  find that, in general, the higher the concerns about the distribution of the 
  impacts of climate change, the more severe the aggregate impacts. Fankhauser's 
  (1995) estimate of the annual global damage of 2xCO<sub>2</sub>, for instance, 
  is based on the implicit assumption that people are neutral with respect to 
  distribution (that is, losses to the poor can be compensated by equal gains 
  to the rich) and risk (that is, a 1:1,000,000 chance of losing $1 million is 
  equivalent to losing $1 with certainty). Replacing these assumptions with standard 
  risk aversion or mild inequity aversion, the global damage estimate increases 
  by about one-third (Fankhauser et al., 1997). Marginal impacts are more sensitive. 
  For the same changes in assumptions, Tol (1999a) finds a three-fold increase 
  in the marginal damage estimate. The sensitivity of aggregate impact estimates 
  is further illustrated in <a href="677.htm#fig194">Figure 19-4</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="19546"></a>19.5.4.6. The Treatment of Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Sensitivity analysis is the standard approach to deal with impact uncertainty. 
  Some studies, however, have gone one step further and explicitly model uncertainty 
  as a hedging problem. The premise underlying these models is that today's 
  policymakers are not required to make once-and-for-all decisions binding their 
  successors over the next century. There will be opportunities for mid-course 
  adjustments. Climate negotiations are best viewed as an ongoing process of "act, 
  then learn." Today's decisionmakers, in this view, must aim at evolving 
  an acceptable hedging strategy that balances the risks of premature actions 
  against those of waiting too long. </p>
<p>The first step, then, is to determine the sensitivity of today's decisions 
  to major uncertainties in the greenhouse debate. How important is it to be able 
  to predict impacts for the second half of this century? Or to know what energy 
  demands will be in 30 years and identify the technologies that will be in place 
  to meet those demands? An exhaustive analysis of these questions has yet to 
  be undertaken, but considerable insight can be gleaned from an Energy Modeling 
  Forum study conducted several years ago (EMF, 1997). In the study, seven modeling 
  teams addressed a key consideration in climate policymaking: concerns about 
  events with low probability but high consequences.</p>
<p>The study assumed uncertainty would not be resolved until 2020. Two parameters 
  were varied: the mean temperature sensitivity factor and the cost of damages 
  associated with climate change and variability. The unfavorable high-consequence 
  scenario was defined as the top 5% of each of these two distributions. Two surveys 
  of expert opinion were used for choosing the distribution of these variables 
  (for climate sensitivity, see Morgan and Keith, 1995; for damages, see Nordhaus, 
  1994a). </p>
<p>The analysis showed that the degree of hedging depends on the stakes, the odds, 
  and nonimpact parameters such as society's attitude toward risk and the 
  cost of greenhouse insurance. Also critical is the timing of the resolution 
  of key uncertainties. This underscores the importance of scientific research.</p>
