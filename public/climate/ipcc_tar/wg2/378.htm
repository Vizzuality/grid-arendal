<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br>
</h1>
Africa is highly vulnerable to the various manifestations of climate change. Six 
situations that are particularly important are: 
<ul>
  <li>Water resources, especially in international shared basins where there is 
    a potential for conflict and a need for regional coordination in water management</li>
  <li>Food security at risk from declines in agricultural production and uncertain 
    climate</li>
  <li>Natural resources productivity at risk and biodiversity that might be irreversibly 
    lost</li>
  <li>Vector- and water-borne diseases, especially in areas with inadequate health 
    infrastructure</li>
  <li>Coastal zones vulnerable to sea-level rise, particularly roads, bridges, 
    buildings, and other infrastructure that is exposed to flooding and other 
    extreme events</li>
  <li>Exacerbation of desertification by changes in rainfall and intensified land 
    use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The historical climate record for Africa shows warming of approximately 0.7&deg;C 
  over most of the continent during the 20th century, a decrease in rainfall over 
  large portions of the Sahel, and an increase in rainfall in east central Africa. 
  Climate change scenarios for Africa, based on results from several general circulation 
  models using data collated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  (IPCC) Data Distribution Center (DDC), indicate future warming across Africa 
  ranging from 0.2&deg;C per decade (low scenario) to more than 0.5&deg;C per 
  decade (high scenario). This warming is greatest over the interior of semi-arid 
  margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa.</p>
<p>Projected future changes in mean seasonal rainfall in Africa are less well 
  defined. Under the low-warming scenario, few areas show trends that significantly 
  exceed natural 30-year variability. Under intermediate warming scenarios, most 
  models project that by 2050 north Africa and the interior of southern Africa 
  will experience decreases during the growing season that exceed one standard 
  deviation of natural variability; in parts of equatorial east Africa, rainfall 
  is predicted to increase in December-February and decrease in June-August. 
  With a more rapid global warming scenario, large areas of Africa would experience 
  changes in December-February or June-August rainfall that significantly 
  exceed natural variability. </p>
<p><i>Water:</i> Africa is the continent with the lowest conversion factor of 
  precipitation to runoff, averaging 15%. Although the equatorial region and coastal 
  areas of eastern and southern Africa are humid, the rest of the continent is 
  dry subhumid to arid. The dominant impact of global warming is predicted to 
  be a reduction in soil moisture in subhumid zones and a reduction in runoff. 
  Current trends in major river basins indicate a decrease in runoff of about 
  17% over the past decade. Reservoir storage shows marked sensitivity to variations 
  in runoff and periods of drought. Lake storage and major dams have reached critically 
  low levels, threatening industrial activity. Model results indicate that global 
  warming will increase the frequency of such low storage episodes.</p>
<p><i>Natural Resources Management and Biodiversity:</i> Land-use changes as a 
  result of population and development pressures will continue to be the major 
  driver of land-cover change in Africa, with climate change becoming an increasingly 
  important contributing factor by mid-century. Resultant changes in ecosystems 
  will affect the distribution and productivity of plant and animal species, water 
  supply, fuelwood, and other services. Losses of biodiversity are likely to be 
  accelerated by climate change, such as in the Afromontane and Cape centers of 
  plant endemism. Projected climate change is expected to lead to altered frequency, 
  intensity, and extent of vegetation fires, with potential feedback effects on 
  climate change.</p>
<p><i>Human Health: </i>Human health is predicted to be adversely affected by 
  projected climate change. Temperature rises will extend the habitats of vectors 
  of diseases such as malaria. Droughts and flooding, where sanitary infrastucture 
  is inadequate, will result in increased frequency of epidemics and enteric diseases. 
  More frequent outbreaks of Rift Valley fever could result from increased rainfall. 
  Increased temperatures of coastal waters could aggrevate cholera epidemics in 
  coastal areas.</p>
<p><i>Food Security: </i>There is wide consensus that climate change, through 
  increased extremes, will worsen food security in Africa. The continent already 
  experiences a major deficit in food production in many areas, and potential 
  declines in soil moisture will be an added burden. Food-importing countries 
  are at greater risk of adverse climate change, and impacts could have as much 
  to do with changes in world markets as with changes in local and regional resources 
  and national agricultural economy. As a result of water stress, inland fisheries 
  will be rendered more vulnerable because of episodic drought and habitat destruction. 
  Ocean warming also will modify ocean currents, with possible impacts on coastal 
  marine fisheries.</p>
<p><i>Settlements and Infrastructure:</i> The basic infrastructure for development&#151;transport, 
  housing, services&#151;is inadequate now, yet it represents substantial investment 
  by governments. An increase in damaging floods, dust storms, and other extremes 
  would result in damage to settlements and infrastructure and affect human health.<br>
  Most of Africa's largest cities are along coasts. A large percentage of 
  Africa's population is land-locked; thus, coastal facilities are economically 
  significant. Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, and flooding 
  will have significant impacts on African communities and economies.</p>
<p><i>Desertification:</i> Climate change and desertification remain inextricably 
  linked through feedbacks between land degradation and precipitation. Climate 
  change might exacerbate desertification through alteration of spatial and temporal 
  patterns in temperature, rainfall, solar insolation, and winds. Conversely, 
  desertification aggravates carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-induced climate change through 
  the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from cleared and dead vegetation and reduction of the carbon 
  sequestration potential of desertified land. Although the relative importance 
  of climatic and anthropogenic factors in causing desertification remains unresolved, 
  evidence shows that certain arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid areas have experienced 
  declines in rainfall, resulting in decreases in soil fertility and agricultural, 
  livestock, forest, and rangeland production. Ultimately, these adverse impacts 
  lead to socioeconomic and political instability. Potential increases in the 
  frequency and severity of drought are likely to exacerbate desertification.</p>
<p>Given the range and magnitude of the development constraints and challenges 
  facing most African nations, the overall capacity for Africa to adapt to climate 
  change is low. Although there is uncertainty in what the future holds, Africa 
  must start planning now to adapt to climate change. National environmental action 
  plans and implementation must incorporate long-term changes and pursue "no 
  regret" strategies. Current technologies and approaches&#151;especially 
  in agriculture and water&#151;are unlikely to be adequate to meet projected 
  demands, and increased climate variability will be an additional stress. Seasonal 
  forecasting&#151;for example, linking sea-surface temperatures to outbreaks 
  of major diseases&#151;is a promising adaptive strategy that will help save 
  lives. It is unlikely that African countries on their own will have sufficient 
  resources to respond effectively.</p>
<p>Climate change also offers some opportunities. The process of adapting to global 
  climate change, including technology transfer, offers new development pathways 
  that could take advantage of Africa's resources and human potential. Examples 
  would include competitive agricultural products, as a result of research in 
  new crop varieties and increased international trade, and industrial developments 
  such as solar energy. Regional cooperation in science, resource management, 
  and development already are increasing.</p>
<p>This assessment of vulnerability to climate change is marked by uncertainty. 
  The diversity of African climates, high rainfall variability, and a very sparse 
  observational network make predictions of future climate change difficult at 
  the subregional and local levels. Underlying exposure and vulnerability to climatic 
  changes are well established. Sensitivity to climatic variations is established 
  but incomplete. However, uncertainty over future conditions means that there 
  is low confidence in projected costs of climate change.</p>
<p>Improvements in national and regional data and capacity to predict impacts 
  is essential. Developing African capacity in environmental assessment will increase 
  the effectiveness of aid. Regional assessments of vulnerability, impacts, and 
  adaptation should be pursued to fill in the many gaps in information.</p>
