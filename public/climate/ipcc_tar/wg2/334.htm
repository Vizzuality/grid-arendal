<h1>8.3.4. Adaptation</h1>
<p>Insurance losses are paid out of premiums and from surplus (net assets). The 
  ability to generate premiums and rebuild surpluses cannot be increased quickly 
  in response to changes in the incidence of losses. In a developing country context, 
  where insurance markets are nascent, this problem is particularly acute. </p>
<p>Insurers have many tools for reducing their financial vulnerability to losses 
  (Mooney, 1998; Berz, 1999; Bruce <i>et al</i>., 1999; Unnewehr, 1999; III, 2000b). 
  These tools include raising prices, nonrenewal of existing policies, cessation 
  of writing new policies, limiting maximum losses claimable, paying for the depreciated 
  value of damaged property instead of new-replacement value, or raising deductibles. 
  The additional strategies of improved pricing and better claims-handling were 
  reviewed in some detail in the SAR (Dlugolecki <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Many adaptation 
  strategies in use or under discussion make good sense for insurers irrespective 
  of potential changes in the climate resulting from human activities (Sarewitz 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000) (see <a href="#box81">Box 8-1</a>).</p>
<p>Insurance prices exhibit sensitivity to disaster events (Paragon Reinsurance 
  Risk Management Services, as cited in Klein, 1997; Edgecliffe-Johnson, 1999). 
  Reinsurance prices rose by approximately 250% following Hurricane Andrew (see 
  <a href="579.htm">Section 15.2.7</a>). Following the upsurge in catastrophe 
  losses in 1999, the trend once again is toward upward pressure on prices (Mooney, 
  2000).</p>
<p>Following the period of (upward) price adjustments in response to a major natural 
  disaster, however, insurers often enter or re-enter a battered market that offers 
  substantial nonactuarially based discounts, resulting in inadequate prices for 
  all players in the market (Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999). Similar behavior has 
  been observed among reinsurers (Stipp, 1997). Insurers also may reduce risk 
  management efforts and incentives in the face of competitive pressures on prices. 
  Competitive pressures can cause some insurers to assume greater risk to offer 
  more attractive prices and products to consumers, through acquisitions of weakened 
  companies and destabilizing growth rates (Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>Favorable underwriting or investment experience may generate surpluses, but 
  many legislatures do not permit insurers explicitly to fund pre-event catastrophe 
  reserves to account for anticipated changes in climate and weather. Alternatively, 
  insurers may try to raise more capital or reduce dividends paid to shareholders, 
  but such actions will not be acceptable to financial markets if the risk-to-reward 
  ratio is not competitive with that of other companies or sectors. The trend 
  toward consolidation within the insurance sector is sometimes regarded as a 
  factor that reduces insurer vulnerability to catastrophic losses.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 8-1. Co-Benefits that Are Relevant for the Insurance 
        and Other Financial Services Sectors </b> </div>
      <p>Co-benefits are discussed elsewhere in the Third Assessment Report (<a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR 
        WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="../wg3/319.htm">8</a>). 
        Several adaptation mechanisms that are relevant to public and private 
        disaster risk management possess important co-benefits, but these mechanisms 
        are rarely accounted for in cost-effectiveness analyses. Though they normally 
        are associated with mitigation (e.g., emissions reductions or enhanced 
        carbon sinks), some also stand to enhance adaptive capacity or otherwise 
        benefit insurers and other parties in the financial services sector (Sarewitz 
        <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Further research on this topic is merited.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Energy End-Use Efficiency.</i> Various co-benefits pertaining to 
          energy-efficient technologies have been documented (Mills and Rosenfeld, 
          1996; Vine <i>et al</i>., 1999, 2000; Changnon and Easterling, 2000; 
          Zwirner, 2000; <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/179.htm">Chapter 
          5</a>). Improved insulation and equipment efficiency can reduce the 
          vulnerability of structures to extreme temperature episodes and contribute 
          to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Other examples include linkages 
          between public transit and reduced speed limits and improved highway 
          safety (Unnewehr, 1999; <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/353.htm">Chapter 
          9</a>); energy-efficient ultraviolet water disinfection to conserve 
          fuelwood and reduce deforestation (Gadgil <i>et al</i>., 1997); and 
          emission reductions resulting in improved air quality and reduced respiratory 
          disease (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>).<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><i> Renewable Energy and Distributed Energy Systems.</i> Certain renewable 
          and distributed energy supply technologies have attributes that are 
          relevant to risk management and disaster recovery (Mills, 1996, 1999; 
          Mills and Knoepfel, 1997). For example, low-power/energy-efficient technologies 
          can reduce business interruption risks by extending the reliability 
          and operating range of backup power systems (Stauffer, 1995; Kats, 1998; 
          Lecomte and Gahagan, 1998; Vine <i>et al</i>., 1999; Deering and Thornton, 
          2000). Substitution of biofuels for fossil fuels can yield improved 
          air quality and reduced flood risk (IPCC, 2000; <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR 
          WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/353.htm">Chapter 9</a>).<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Sustainable Forestry, Agriculture, and Wetlands Management. </i>Enhancing 
          organic soil content benefits crop insurance as well as contributing 
          to improved water quality and food security. Sustainable forestry practices 
          yield benefits of watershed management and flood/mudflow control, which 
          are necessary foundations for establishing a modern economy (Scott, 
          1996; IFRC-RCS, 1999b; IPCC, 2000; Hamilton, 2000; see also <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
          5</a>). Wetlands restoration helps to protect against flooding and coastal 
          erosion, although methane release from wetlands also must be considered 
          (IPCC, 2000).<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><i>"Green" Financial Products. </i>Initiatives such as innovative 
          financing of energy-efficiency improvements, insurance products that 
          promote better environmental management, or insurance for adaptation/mitigation 
          projects under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
          can simultaneously support adaptation and mitigation objectives (Hugenschmidt 
          and Janssen, 1999; Mills, 1999; UNEP, 1999; Zwirner, 2000). However, 
          considerable business risk and liability may be associated with UNFCCC 
          projects if measurement and verification are poor or issues of buyer/seller 
          liability are not addressed by insurers in the drafting of insurance 
          contracts</li>
