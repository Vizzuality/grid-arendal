<h2>3.2. Agriculture and Food Security </h2>
<p>Based on experimental research, crop yield responses to climate change vary 
  widely, depending upon species and cultivar; soil properties; pests, and pathogens; 
  the direct effects of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) on plants; and interactions 
  between CO<sub>2</sub>, air temperature, water stress, mineral nutrition, air 
  quality, and adaptive responses. Even though increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  can stimulate crop growth and yield, that benefit may not always overcome the 
  adverse effects of excessive heat and drought (medium confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  These advances, along with advances in research on agricultural adaptation, 
  have been incorporated since the Second Assessment Report (SAR) into models 
  used to assess the effects of climate change on crop yields, food supply, farm 
  incomes, and prices. [<a href="032.htm">4.2</a>]</p>
<p>Costs will be involved in coping with climate-induced yield losses and adaptation 
  of livestock production systems. These agronomic and husbandry adaptation options 
  could include, for example, adjustments to planting dates, fertilization rates, 
  irrigation applications, cultivar traits, and selection of animal species. [<a href="032.htm">4.2</a>]</p>
<p>When autonomous agronomic adaptation is included, crop modeling assessments 
  indicate, with medium to low confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>, 
  that climate change will lead to generally positive responses at less than a 
  few &deg;C warming and generally negative responses for more than a few &deg;C 
  in mid-latitude crop yields. Similar assessments indicate that yields of some 
  crops in tropical locations would decrease generally with even minimal increases 
  in temperature, because such crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance 
  and dryland/rainfed agriculture predominates. Where there is also a large decrease 
  in rainfall, tropical crop yields would be even more adversely affected. With 
  autonomous agronomic adaptation, crop yields in the tropics tend to be less 
  adversely affected by climate change than without adaptation, but they still 
  tend to remain below levels estimated with current climate. [<a href="032.htm">4.2</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>Most global and regional economic studies not incorporating climate change 
  indicate that the downward trend in global real commodity prices in the 20th 
  century is likely to continue into the 21st, although confidence in these predictions 
  decreases farther into the future. Economic modeling assessments indicate that 
  impacts of climate change on agricultural production and prices are estimated 
  to result in small percentage changes in global income (low confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>), 
  with larger increases in more developed regions and smaller increases or declines 
  in developing regions. Improved confidence in this finding depends on further 
  research into the sensitivity of economic modeling assessments to their base 
  assumptions. [<a href="032.htm">4.2</a> and <a href="214.htm#box55">Box 5-5</a>]</p>
<p>Most studies indicate that global mean annual temperature increases of a few 
  &deg;C or greater would prompt food prices to increase due to a slowing in the 
  expansion of global food supply relative to growth in global food demand (established, 
  but incomplete<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  At lesser amounts of warming than a few &deg;C, economic models do not clearly 
  distinguish the climate change signal from other sources of change based on 
  those studies included in this assessment. Some recent aggregated studies have 
  estimated economic impacts on vulnerable populations such as smallholder producers 
  and poor urban consumers. These studies find that climate change would lower 
  incomes of the vulnerable populations and increase the absolute number of people 
  at risk of hunger, though this is uncertain and requires further research. It 
  is established, though incompletely, that climate change, mainly through increased 
  extremes and temporal/ spatial shifts, will worsen food security in Africa.
