<h4>10.2.4.3. Meningitis</h4>
<p>Major epidemics of meningococcal infections usually occur every 5-10 years 
  within the African "meningitis belt;" they usually start in the middle 
  of the dry season and end a few months later with the onset of the rains (Greenwood, 
  1984). Between February and April 1996, the disease affected thousands of people 
  in parts of northern Nigeria, many of whom died (Angyo and Okpeh, 1997). This 
  epidemic spread from the original meningitis belt to Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, 
  Zambia, and Tanzania (Hart and Cuevas, 1997). One of the environmental factors 
  that predisposes to infection and epidemics is low humidity (Tikhomirov <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1997). However, a climate-meningitis association was not clear in parts 
  of the Gulf of Guinea (Besancenot <i>et al.,</i> 1997). That this disease has 
  been limited to the semi-arid areas of Africa suggests that its transmission 
  could be affected by warming and reduced precipitation. </p>
<h4>10.2.4.4. Rift Valley Fever<a name="10244"></a></h4>
<p>From 1931 (when the disease was first described) until the end of the 1970s, 
  Rift Valley fever (RVF) was considered to be a relatively benign zoonoses for 
  humans that periodically developed in domestic animals (especially sheep) following 
  heavy rains (Lefevre, 1997). Recent research indicates that although epizootics 
  in east Africa are associated with an increase in rainfall, a similar association 
  is unknown in west Africa (Zeller <i>et al., </i>1997). Recent data from west 
  Africa indicate that the risk of a new epizootic is increasing in the region 
  (Fontenille <i>et al.,</i> 1995), with significant exposure to the virus among 
  livestock herders and wildlife rangers during the wet season (Olaleye <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1996). Following the 1997-1998 El Ni&ntilde;o event in east Africa, 
  an RVF outbreak in Somalia and northern Kenya killed as much as 80% of the livestock 
  and affected their owners (WHO, 1998b). Many cases also were reported in Tanzania. 
  In Mauritania, the human epidemic was linked to the epizootic disease (Jouan 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1989). Extensive research on mosquito vectors of RVF in Kenya 
  (mainly <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Culex spp</i>.) has clearly linked the risk of outbreak 
  with flooding (Linthicum <i>et al.,</i> 1990). It can be expected that increased 
  precipitation as a consequence of climate change could increase the risk of 
  infections in livestock and people. Such new risks could cause major economic 
  and health problems for herding communities in Africa. </p>
<h4>10.2.4.5. Plague<a name="10245"></a></h4>
<p>Plague is a flea-borne disease with rodents as reservoirs. The population of 
  rodents can increase suddenly following heavy rains as a result of abundance 
  of food (e.g., grain). During drought, rodents may migrate into human dwellings 
  in search of food. Development of fleas and the pathogens they carry can be 
  accelerated by increased temperature. Plague outbreaks recently have been reported 
  in Mozambique, Namibia, Malawi, Zambia, and Uganda (see WHO Outbreak Web site: 
  &lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news">www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news</a>&gt;).</p>
<h4>10.2.4.6. Water-Associated Protozoal Diseases <a name="10246"></a></h4>
<p>Pollution of streams, wells, and other sources of rural water supplies by flooding 
  could introduce parasites such as giardia, amoeba, and cryptosporidium into 
  drinking water (Alterholf <i>et al.,</i> 1998). These parasites assume a new 
  significance in HIV-infected individuals because of the latter's immunocompromised 
  status (Mwachari <i>et al.,</i> 1998). Extreme weather events such as El Ni&ntilde;o 
  have been associated with increased episodes of diarrhea.</p>
<h4>10.2.4.7. Other Major Parasitic Infections<a name="10247"></a></h4>
<p>Shifts in the epidemiology of schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and filariasis 
  may take longer to become evident because these parasites are less sensitive 
  to the effects of climate than diseases such as malaria. Changes in the impacts 
  of climate on human trypnosomiasis may require substantial and permanent changes 
  in tsetse fly ecology. Little or no data are available on this subject. </p>
<h4>10.2.4.8. Air Pollution-Associated Diseases<a name="10248"></a></h4>
<p>Biomass burning and massive importation of badly maintained vehicles could 
  result in increased air pollution&#151;which, combined with increasing temperature, 
  would exacerbate health risks such as respiratory problems and eye and skin 
  infections (Boko, 1988).</p>
