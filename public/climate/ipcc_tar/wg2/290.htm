<h3>6.3.5. Aquaculture</h3>
<p>Marine aquaculture production more than doubled from 4.96 Mt in 1990 to 11.14 
  Mt in 1997. Similar trends were exhibited in freshwater aquaculture, with increases 
  from 8.17 Mt in 1990 to 17.13 Mt in 1997, while yields from marine and freshwater 
  fisheries remained relatively constant. The net result was that aquaculture 
  production represented approximately 30% of total fish and shellfish production 
  for human consumption in 1997. Aquaculture production is expected to continue 
  its upward trend in the foreseeable future, although in many areas (such as 
  in Thailand) there is a boom and bust pattern to aquaculture. </p>
<p>About 30% (29.5 Mt) of the world fish catch is used for nonhuman consumption, 
  including the production of fishmeal and fish oils that are employed in agriculture, 
  in aquaculture, and for industrial purposes. Fishmeal and fish oils are key 
  diet components for aquaculture production; depending on the species being cultured, 
  they may constitute more than 50% of the feed. Climate change could have dramatic 
  impacts on fish production, which would affect the supply of fishmeal and fish 
  oils. Unless alternative sources of protein are found, future aquaculture production 
  could be limited by the supply of fishmeal or fish oils if stocks of species 
  used in the production of fishmeal are negatively affected by climate change 
  and live-fish production. The precise impacts on future aquaculture production 
  also will depend in part on other competing uses for fishmeal and fish oils. 
  Usage of other sources of protein or developments in synthetic oils for industrial 
  applications could reduce demands on fishmeal and fish oils, thereby reducing 
  potential impacts on aquaculture.</p>
<p>Climate change is expected to have physical and ecosystem impacts in the freshwater 
  and marine environments in which aquaculture is situated. Water and air temperatures 
  in mid- to high latitudes are expected to rise, with a consequent lengthening 
  of the growing season for cultured fish and shellfish. These changes could have 
  beneficial impacts with respect to growth rate and feed conversion efficiency 
  (Lehtonen, 1996). However, increased water temperatures and other associated 
  physical changes, such as shifts in dissolved oxygen levels, have been linked 
  to increases in the intensity and frequency of disease outbreaks and may result 
  in more frequent algal blooms in coastal areas (Kent and Poppe, 1998). Any increases 
  in the intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events such as storms, floods, 
  and droughts will negatively impact aquaculture production and may result in 
  significant infrastructure damage. Sea-level rise can be expected to have a 
  negative effect on pond walls and defenses.</p>
<p>Elevated temperatures of coastal waters also could lead to increased production 
  of aquaculture species by expanding their range. These species could be cultivated 
  in higher latitudes as well as in existing aquafarms as a result of a longer 
  warm season during which water temperature will be near optimal. A decrease 
  in sea-ice cover could widen the geographical boundaries, allowing cultivation 
  of commercially valuable species in areas hitherto not suitable for such developments.</p>
<a name="636"></a><h3>6.3.6. Ocean Ranching</h3>
<p>Ocean ranching is used to increase the production of several fish species. 
  The primary difference between ocean ranching and aquaculture is that in ocean 
  ranching the fish are cultured for only a portion of their life cycle and then 
  released prior to maturity. The cultured fish are then captured as "common 
  property" in a variety of fisheries. These cultured or "enhanced" 
  fish interact with the wild fish in the ecosystem and compete for the finite 
  food and habitat resources available (often referred to as "carrying capacity"). 
  Climate change will alter carrying capacity, but the impacts associated with 
  ocean ranching or stock enhancement activities also need to be considered when 
  examining overall changes to the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Although the precise impacts are species-dependent, the addition of billions 
  of enhanced fish into the marine ecosystem may have significant consequences 
  from genetic and ecological perspectives. In the Pacific, for example, large 
  numbers of salmon are released from hatcheries in Russia, Japan, Canada, and 
  the United States (Mahnken <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Beamish <i>et al.</i> (1997) 
  estimate that 83% of the catch of chum salmon by all countries is from hatchery 
  production. If climate change increases SST and reduces winter wind mixing in 
  the upper layers of the ocean, the feeding areas for salmon may be less productive 
  because of increased surface layer stability. Reductions in overall production 
  and catches of salmon&#151;and likely other species&#151;would result (Gargett, 
  1997). </p>
