<h3><a name="436"></a>4.3.6. River Flows </h3>
<p>By far the greatest number of hydrological studies into the effects of climate 
  change have concentrated on potential changes on streamflow and runoff. The 
  distinction between &#147;streamflow&#148; and &#147;runoff&#148; can be vague, 
  but in general terms streamflow is water within a river channel, usually expressed 
  as a rate of flow past a point&#151;typically in m<sup>3</sup>  s<sup>-1</sup> &#151;whereas runoff 
  is the amount of precipitation that does not evaporate, usually expressed as 
  an equivalent depth of water across the area of the catchment. A simple link 
  between the two is that runoff can be regarded as streamflow divided by catchment 
  area, although in dry areas this does not necessarily hold because runoff generated 
  in one part of the catchment may infiltrate before reaching a channel and becoming 
  streamflow. Over short durations, the amount of water leaving a catchment outlet 
  usually is expressed as streamflow; over durations of a month or more, it usually 
  is expressed as runoff. In some countries, &#147;runoff&#148; implies surface 
  runoff only (or, more precisely, rapid response to an input of precipitation) 
  and does not include the contribution of discharge from groundwater to flow, 
  but this is a narrow definition of the term.</p>
<p>This section first considers recent trends in streamflow/runoff and then summarizes 
  research into the potential effects of future climate change.</p>
<h4><a name="4361"></a>4.3.6.1. Trends in Observed Streamflow</h4>
<p>Since the SAR, there have been many notable hydrological events&#151;including 
  floods and droughts&#151;and therefore many studies into possible trends in 
  hydrological data. <a href="167.htm#tab41">Table 4-1</a> summarizes some of 
  these studies and their main results.</p>
<p>In general, the patterns found are consistent with those identified for precipitation: 
  Runoff tends to increase where precipitation has increased and decrease where 
  it has fallen over the past few years. Flows have increased in recent years 
  in many parts of the United States, for example, with the greatest increases 
  in low flows (Lins and Slack, 1999). Variations in flow from year to year have 
  been found to be much more strongly related to precipitation changes than to 
  temperature changes (e.g., Krasovskaia, 1995; Risbey and Entekhabi, 1996). There 
  are some more subtle patterns, however. In large parts of eastern Europe, European 
  Russia, central Canada (Westmacott and Burn, 1997), and California (Dettinger 
  and Cayan, 1995), a major&#151;and unprecedented&#151;shift in streamflow from 
  spring to winter has been associated not only with a change in precipitation 
  totals but more particularly with a rise in temperature: Precipitation has fallen 
  as rain, rather than snow, and therefore has reached rivers more rapidly than 
  before. In cold regions, such as northern Siberia and northern Canada, a recent 
  increase in temperature has had little effect on flow timing because precipitation 
  continues to fall as snow (Shiklomanov, 1994; Shiklomanov et al., 2000).</p>

<p>However, it is very difficult to identify trends in hydrological data, for 
  several reasons. Records tend to be short, and many data sets come from catchments 
  with a long history of human intervention. Variability over time in hydrological 
  behavior is very high, particularly in drier environments, and detection of 
  any signal is difficult. Variability arising from low-frequency climatic rhythms 
  is increasingly recognized (<a href="162.htm">Section 4.2</a>), and researchers 
  looking for trends need to correct for these patterns. Finally, land-use and 
  other changes are continuing in many catchments, with effects that may outweigh 
  any climatic trends. Changnon and Demissie (1996), for example, show that human-induced 
  changes mask the effects of climatic variability in a sample of midwest U.S. 
  catchments. Even if a trend is identified, it may be difficult to attribute 
  it to global warming because of other changes that are continuing in a catchment. 
  A widespread lack of data, particularly from many developing countries, and 
  consistent data analysis makes it impossible to obtain a representative picture 
  of recent patterns and trends in hydrological behavior. Monitoring stations 
  are continuing to be closed in many countries. Reconstructions of long records, 
  stretching back centuries, are needed to understand the characteristics of natural 
  decadal-scale variability in streamflow.</p>
