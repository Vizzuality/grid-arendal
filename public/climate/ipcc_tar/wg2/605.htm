<h3><a name="1624"></a>16.2.4. Changes in Sea Ice</h3>
<p>Sea ice is a predominant feature of the polar oceans. Its extent expands and 
  contracts markedly from winter to summer. Sea ice has a dramatic effect on the 
  physical characteristics of the ocean surface. The normal exchange of heat and 
  mass between the atmosphere and ocean is strongly modulated by sea ice, which 
  isolates the sea surface from the usual atmospheric forcing (Williams <i>et al</i>., 
  1998a). In addition, sea ice affects albedo, the exchange of heat and moisture 
  with the atmosphere, and the habitats of marine life. Finally, sea ice plays 
  a significant role in the thermohaline circulation of the ocean. Changes in 
  air temperature expected with projected climate change are likely to alter the 
  sea-ice regime and hence have impacts on the foregoing mechanisms.<br>
</p>
<p>Warming is expected to cause a reduction in the area covered by sea ice, which 
  in turn will allow increased absorption of solar radiation and a further increase 
  in temperature. In some climate models, this sea ice-albedo feedback has led 
  to amplification of projected warming at higher latitudes, more in the Arctic 
  Ocean than in the Southern Ocean. At some point, with prolonged warming a transition 
  to an Arctic Ocean that is ice-free in summer&#151;and perhaps even in the winter&#151;could 
  take place. The possibility of a transition to an ice-free Arctic Ocean that 
  is irreversible also must be considered. Climate models predict a wide range 
  of changes for polar sea ice by the year 2100 (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> 
  <a href="../wg1/038.htm">Chapter 1</a>). Many of the earlier models treated sea ice 
  very simplistically and were not coupled with the ocean, so their results are 
  unlikely to be reliable. More recent climate models include sophisticated sea-ice 
  routines that take into account the dynamics and thermodynamics that control 
  sea-ice formation, transport, and melt (Everett and Fitzharris, 1998). These 
  models, however, still are limited in their ability to reproduce detailed aspects 
  of sea-ice distribution and timing.</p>
<p>Snow on sea ice controls most of the radiative exchange between the ocean and 
  atmosphere, but its exact role in energy transfer is uncertain (Iacozza and 
  Barber, 1999) and difficult to model because of a lack of adequate data (Hanesiak 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999; Wu <i>et al</i>., 1999). A further complication is the 
  timing of snowfall in relation to formation of sea ice (Barber and Nghiem, 1999). 
  Accumulation of snow on sea ice also plays a significant role in sub-ice primary 
  production and for habitats of marine mammals (e.g., polar bear and seals). 
</p>
<h4><a name="16241"></a>16.2.4.1. Sea Ice in the Arctic Ocean </h4>
<p>Whether the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean will shrink depends on changes in the 
  overall ice and salinity budget, the rate of sea-ice production, the rate of 
  melt, and advection of sea ice into and out of the Arctic Basin. The most important 
  exit route is through Fram Strait (Vinje <i>et al</i>., 1998). The mean annual export 
  of sea ice through Fram Strait was ~2,850 km<sup>3</sup> for the period 1990-1996, 
  but there is high interannual variability caused by atmospheric forcing and, 
  to a lesser degree, ice thickness variations. Other important passages are the 
  northern Barents Sea and through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Rothrock <i>et al</i>., 1999). Analyses by Gordon and O'Farrell (1997), using a dynamic ice 
  routine with a transient coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model (Commonwealth 
  Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&#151;CSIRO), predict a 60% loss 
  in summer sea ice in the Arctic for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. The summer 
  season, during which ice retreats far offshore, increases from 60 to 150 days. 
  The likely distance between northern coasts and Arctic pack ice will increase 
  from the current 150-200 to 500-800 km. <br>
</p>
<p>In a more recent study, there is good agreement between Arctic sea-ice trends 
  and those simulated by control and transient integrations from the Geophysical 
  Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the Hadley Centre (see <a href="604.htm#fig166">Figure 
  16-6</a>). Although the Hadley Centre climate model underestimates sea-ice extent 
  and thickness, the trends of the two models are similar. Both models predict 
  continued decreases in sea-ice thickness and extent (Vinnikov <i>et al</i>., 
  1999), so that by 2050, sea-ice extent is reduced to about 80% of area it covered 
  at the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>GCM simulations for Arctic sea ice predict that warming will cause a decrease 
  in maximum ice thickness of about 0.06 m per &deg;C and an increase in open 
  water duration of about 7.5 days per &deg;C (Flato and Brown, 1996). These projections 
  are somewhat lower than changes observed during the latter part of the 20th 
  century (see <a href="596.htm#1613">Section 16.1.3</a>). Increased snowfall 
  initially causes a decrease in maximum thickness (and corresponding increase 
  in open-water duration), but beyond 4 mm per day (1.33 mm per day water equivalent), 
  formation of "slush ice" by surface flooding offsets the insulating effect of 
  snow and causes an increase in maximum thickness and a decrease in the duration 
  of open water.<br>
</p>
<p>Without sea ice, wave heights will increase, and the Arctic coast will be more 
  exposed to severe weather events such as storm surges that cause increased coastal 
  erosion, inundation, and threat to structures. Areas of ice-rich permafrost 
  are particularly vulnerable to coastal erosion (Nairn <i>et al</i>., 1998; Wolfe 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). A portent of the future is severe coastal erosion&#151;as 
  much as 40 m yr<sup>-1</sup>&#151;along the Siberian coast. Deposited organic 
  material changes the entire biogeochemistry of the nearshore waters (Weller 
  and Lange, 1999). More open water may lead to increased precipitation and further 
  amelioration of temperatures. Projected losses in sea ice are likely to have 
  considerable impacts on Arctic biology through the entire food chain, from algae 
  to higher predators (e.g., polar bears and seals). Loss of sea ice also will 
  affect indigenous peoples and their traditional ways of life. A more open ocean 
  will favor increased shipping along high-latitude routes and could lead to faster 
  and cheaper ship transport between eastern Asia, Europe, and eastern North Amercia.</p>
