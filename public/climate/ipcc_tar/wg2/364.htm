<h4>9.7.8.1. Lyme Disease</h4>
<p>Lyme disease is caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. 
  It is transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex (Dennis, 1998). Lyme 
  disease has a global distribution in temperate countries of North America, Europe, 
  and Asia. The transmission cycle of Lyme disease involves a range of mammalian 
  and avian species, as well as tick species&#151;all of which are affected by 
  local ecology. Under climate change, a shift toward milder winter temperatures 
  may enable expansion of the range of Lyme disease into higher latitudes and 
  altitudes, but only if all of the vertebrate host species required by the tick 
  vector also are able to expand their distribution. A combination of milder winters 
  and extended spring and autumn seasons would be expected to prolong seasons 
  for tick activity and enhance endemicity, but this would not be expected to 
  change disease activity because humans usually are infected by the nymphal stage, 
  which feeds at a specific time during the second year of the cycle.</p>
<h4><a name="9782"></a>9.7.8.2. Tick-Borne Encephalitis</h4>
<p>Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by two closely related but biologically 
  distinct viruses (Gubler and Roehrig, 1998). The eastern subtype is transmitted 
  by Ixodes persulcatus and causes Russian spring-summer encephalitis. It occurs 
  from China to eastern Europe and is highly focal in its distribution. The western 
  subtype is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus and causes central European encephalitis, 
  a milder form of the disease. It occurs within discrete foci from Scandinavia 
  in the north to Croatia in the south, with only occasional cases further south. 
  A related virus, Powassan, occurs in Canada and the United States and is transmitted 
  by Ixodes scapularis. Humans usually become infected when they are exposed to 
  ticks in habitats where the viruses are maintained. The viruses also may be 
  transmitted directly through ingestion of raw goat milk.</p>
<p>It is possible that warming would extend the transmission season for TBE in 
  Europe. The aforementioned study showed a northward extension of the tick population 
  in Sweden in association with warmer winters, accompanied by an increase in 
  the annual number of cases of tick-borne encephalitis reported within Sweden. 
  Most transmission to humans is by the nymphal ticks, each of which feeds for 
  a few days during spring-summer before dropping to the ground and molting to 
  adult ticks, which feed primarily on deer and other large mammals. All tick 
  stages have well-defined seasons of feeding activity, which vary geographically 
  and may be prolonged in regions with mild winters.<br>
</p>
<p>Unlike Lyme disease, sustainable transmission of TBE requires a high level 
  of coincident feeding of larval and nymphal ticks. This seasonal synchrony depends 
  on a particular seasonal profile of land surface temperature&#151;specifically, 
  a rapid rate of cooling in the autumn (Randolph <i>et al</i>., 2000). Synchrony 
  may be disrupted by climate change as patterns of overwinter development by 
  ticks are changed. A statistical model, based on the current distribution of 
  TBE, indicates significant net contraction in the geographic distribution of 
  TBE under mid-range climate scenarios by the 2050s (Randolph and Rogers, 2000). 
  The model indicates that although disease foci spread to higher latitudes and 
  altitudes, current foci in central Europe largely disappear as a result of disruption 
  of the tick seasonal dynamic by climate change. Thus, one model suggests that 
  it is unlikely that warming would increase the incidence or net geographic distribution 
  of TBE in Europe.</p>
