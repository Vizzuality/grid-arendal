<h3>3.4.5. UV-B Radiation Scenarios</h3>
<h4><a name="3451"></a>3.4.5.1. Reference Conditions</h4>
<p>Anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (freons) and some other substances 
  into the atmosphere are known to deplete the stratospheric ozone layer (Albritton 
  and Kuijpers, 1999). This layer absorbs ultraviolet solar radiation within a 
  wavelength range of 280-320 nm (UV-B), and its depletion leads to an increase 
  in ground-level flux of UV-B radiation (Herman <i>et al</i>., 1996; Jackman 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; McPeters <i>et al</i>., 1996; Madronich <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; McKenzie <i>et al</i>., 1999). Enhanced UV-B suppresses the immune system 
  and may cause skin cancer in humans and eye damage in humans and other animal 
  species (Diffey, 1992; de Gruijl, 1997; Longstreth <i>et al</i>., 1998). It 
  can affect terrestrial and marine ecosystems (IASC, 1995; Zerefos and Alkiviadis, 
  1997; Caldwell <i>et al</i>., 1998; Hader <i>et al</i>., 1998; Krupa <i>et al</i>., 
  1998) and biogeochemical cycles (Zepp <i>et al</i>., 1998) and may reduce the 
  service life of natural and synthetic polymer materials (Andrady <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). It also interacts with other atmospheric constituents, including GHGs, 
  influencing radiative forcing of the climate (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> 
  <a href="../wg1/127.htm">Chapters 4</a>, <a href="../wg1/212.htm">6</a>, and <a href="../wg1/260.htm">7</a>).</p>
<p>Analyses of ozone data and depletion processes since the early 1970s have shown 
  that the total ozone column has declined in northern hemisphere mid-latitudes 
  by about 6% in winter/spring and 3% in summer/autumn, and in southern hemisphere 
  mid-latitudes by about 5% on a year-round basis. Spring depletion has been greatest 
  in the polar regions: about 50% in the Antarctic and 15% in the Arctic (Albritton 
  and Kuijpers, 1999). These five values are estimated to have been accompanied 
  by increases in surface UV-B radiation of 7, 4, 6, 130, and 22%, respectively, 
  assuming other influences such as clouds to be constant. Following a linear 
  increase during the 1980s, the 1990s springtime ozone depletion in Antarctica 
  has continued at about the same level each year. In contrast, a series of cold, 
  protracted winters in the Arctic have promoted large depletions of ozone levels 
  during the 1990s (Albritton and Kuijpers, 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="3452"></a>3.4.5.2. Development and Application of UV-B Scenarios</h4>
<p>Scenarios of the future thickness of the ozone column under given emissions 
  of ozone-depleting gases can be determined with atmospheric chemistry models 
  (Alexandrov <i>et al</i>., 1992; Brasseur <i>et al</i>., 1998), sometimes in 
  combination with expert judgment. Processes that affect surface UV-B flux also 
  have been investigated via models (Alexandrov <i>et al</i>., 1992; Matthijsen 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Furthermore, several simulations have been conducted with 
  coupled atmospheric chemistry and climate models, to investigate the relationship 
  between GHG-induced climate change and ozone depletion for different scenarios 
  of halogenated compounds (Austin <i>et al</i>., 1992; Shindell <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). It is known that potential stratospheric cooling resulting from climate 
  change may increase the likelihood of formation of polar stratospheric clouds, 
  which enhance the catalytic destruction of ozone. Conversely, ozone depletion 
  itself contributes to cooling of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere 
  (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/260.htm">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
<p>Serious international efforts aimed at arresting anthropogenic emissions of 
  ozone-depleting gases already have been undertaken&#151;namely, the Vienna Convention 
  for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) and the Montreal Protocol on Substances 
  that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1990) and its Amendments. The abundance of ozone-depleting 
  gases in the atmosphere peaked in the late 1990s and now is expected to decline 
  as a result of these measures (Montzka <i>et al</i>., 1996), recovering to pre-1980 
  levels around 2050 (Albritton and Kuijpers, 1999). Without these measures, ozone 
  depletion by 2050 was projected to exceed 50% in northern mid-latitudes and 
  70% in southern mid-latitudes&#151;about 10 times larger than today. UV-B radiation 
  was projected to double and quadruple in northern and southern mid-latitudes, 
  respectively (Albritton and Kuijpers, 1999).</p>
<p>There have been numerous experimental artificial exposure studies of the effects 
  of UV-B radiation on plants (Runeckles and Krupa, 1994). There also have been 
  a few investigations of the joint effects of enhanced UV-B and other environmental 
  changes, including climate (Unsworth and Hogsett, 1996; Gwynne-Jones <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Sullivan, 1997). A study of the impacts of UV-B on skin cancer incidence 
  in The Netherlands and Australia to 2050, using integrated models, is reported 
  by Martens (1998), who employed scenarios of future ozone depletion based on 
  the IS92a emissions scenario and two scenarios assuming compliance with the 
  London and Copenhagen Amendments to the Montreal Protocol.</p>
