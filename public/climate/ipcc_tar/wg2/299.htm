<h3>6.5.4. Socioeconomic Impacts and Natural Systems</h3>
<p>Turner <i>et al.</i> (1995) assert that relationships between the physical impacts 
  of climate change and socioeconomic implications in the coastal zone have not 
  been fully encompassed in recent work. This statement remains valid to date. 
  Some attempts have been made to express the value of coastal features that are 
  normally regarded as nonmarket goods (Costanza <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Alexander <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998). Several assessments of mangrove and reef ecosystems have highlighted 
  their economic value on the basis of ecosystem goods and services, as well as 
  natural capital value (e.g., Moberg and Folke, 1999). </p>
<p>Estimates of the monetary value of wetlands and information about attitudes 
  toward wetland conservation can be used in policy decisions (e.g., S&ouml;derqvist, 
  2000). "Use" and "non-use" values may be determined (Stein 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). For example, R&ouml;nnb&auml;ck (1999) suggests that mangrove 
  systems alone account for US$800-16,000 ha<sup>-1</sup> in seafood production. Streever 
  <i>et al.</i> (1998) sought public attitudes and values for wetland conservation in 
  New South Wales, Australia, and found that a conservative estimate of the aggregate 
  value of these wetlands, based on willingness-to-pay criteria, was US$30 million 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> for the next 5 years. They also refer to an earlier study on the value 
  of marketable fish in mangrove habitats of Moreton Bay, Queensland, estimated 
  at more than US$6,000 ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Marton, 1990). Stein <i>et al.</i> (2000) have developed 
  a framework for crediting and debiting wetland values that they suggest provides 
  an ecologically effective and economically efficient means to fulfill compensatory 
  mitigation requirements for impacts to aquatic resources.</p>
<p>Climate change impacts on natural systems can have profound effects on socioeconomic 
  systems (Harvey <i>et al.</i>, 1999). One example cited by Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> (1999) 
  is the 1998 coral bleaching event in the Indian Ocean. This event was unprecedented 
  in severity; mortality rates reached as high as 90% in many shallow reefs, such 
  as in the Maldives and the Seychelles. Such severe impacts are expected to have 
  long-term socioeconomic consequences as a result of changed fish species mix 
  and decreased fish stocks and negative effects on tourism as a result of degraded 
  reefs. Degradation of reefs also will lead to diminished natural protection 
  of coastal infrastructure against high waves and storm surges on low-lying atolls. 
  Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> (1999) estimate the costs of the 1998 bleaching event to be 
  between US$706 million (optimistic) and US$8,190 million (pessimistic) over 
  the next 20 years. The Maldives and the Seychelles are identified as particularly 
  affected, because of their heavy reliance on tourism and fishery. </p>
<p>Some economic impacts of marine diseases and harmful algal blooms influenced 
  by climate variations have been evaluated since the SAR. An outbreak in 1997 
  of the toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscida, which has been associated with 
  increased nutrients and SSTs, caused large fish kills on the U.S. Atlantic coast 
  that resulted in public avoidance and economic losses estimated at US$60 million 
  (CHGE, 1999). A persistent brown tide bloom in the Peconic Estuary system of 
  New York blocked light and depleted oxygen in the water column, severely affecting 
  seagrass beds and reducing the value of the Peconic Bay scallop fishery by approximately 
  80% (CHGE, 1999). Harmful algal blooms associated with increased SST and the 
  influx of nutrients into an estuary can result in economic harm through shellfish 
  closures, impacts on tourism, reduction of estuarine primary productivity, deterioration 
  of fishery habitat (e.g., seagrass beds), and mortality of fish and shellfish.</p>

<h3>6.5.5. Social and Cultural Impacts</h3>
<p>In some coastal societies, the significance of cultural values is equal to 
  or even greater than that of economic values. Thus, some methodologies have 
  been developed that include traditional social characteristics, traditional 
  knowledge, subsistence economy, close ties of people to customary land tenure, 
  and the fact that these factors are intrinsic components of the coastal zone 
  (e.g., Kay and Hay, 1993). As such, they must be taken into account in certain 
  contexts, including many South Pacific island countries (e.g., Yamada <i>et al.</i>, 
  1995; Solomon and Forbes, 1999) and indigenous communities in northern high 
  latitudes (e.g., Peters, 1999), among other examples.</p>
<p>Patterns of human development and social organization in a community are important 
  determinants of the vulnerability of people and social institutions to sea-level 
  rise and other coastal hazards. This observation does not mean that all people 
  in a community share equal vulnerability; pre-event social factors determine 
  how certain categories of people will be affected (Heinz Center, 1999). Poverty 
  is directly correlated with the incidence of disease outbreaks (CHGE, 1999) 
  and the vulnerability of coastal residents to coastal hazards (Heinz Center, 
  1999). </p>
<p>Examples of inequitable vulnerability to coastal hazards include population 
  shifts in Pacific island nations such as Tonga and Kiribati. In Tonga, people 
  moving from outer islands to the main island of Tongatapu were forced to settle 
  in low-lying areas, including the old dumping site, where they were proportionally 
  more vulnerable to flooding and disease (Fifita <i>et al.</i>, 1992). Storm-surge flooding 
  in Bangladesh has caused very high mortality in the coastal population (e.g., 
  at least 225,000 in November 1970 and 138,000 in April 1991), with the highest 
  mortality among the old and weak (Burton <i>et al.</i>, 1993). Land that is subject 
  to flooding&#151;at least 15% of the Bangladesh land area&#151;is disproportionately 
  occupied by people living a marginal existence with few options or resources 
  for adaptation.</p>
<p>El-Raey <i>et al.</i> (1997, 1999) studied the effects of a 0.5-m sea-level rise on 
  the Nile delta. In addition to economic costs from loss of agricultural land 
  and date palms, they identify social and cultural impacts. Under a no-protection 
  policy, El-Raey <i>et al.</i> (1997) predict that the population would suffer from 
  the loss of residential shelter (32% of urban areas flooded) and employment 
  (33.7% of jobs lost). In addition, a substantial number of monuments and historic 
  sites would be lost (52%).</p>
