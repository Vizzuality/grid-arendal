<h3>12.5.6. Drought</h3>
<p>In the Australia and New Zealand region, droughts are closely related to major 
  drivers of year-to-year and decadal variability such as ENSO, Indian Ocean SSTs, 
  the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (White and Peterson, 1996; Cai <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999; White and Cherry, 1999), and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (Mantua 
  et al., 1997; Power <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Salinger and Mullan, 1999), as well 
  as more or less chaotic synoptic events. These are all likely to be affected 
  by climate change (see <a href="467.htm#1215">Sections 12.1.5</a> and <a href="469.htm#122">12.2.3</a>, 
  and TAR WGI <a href="347.htm">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="377.htm">10</a>).</p>
<p>Using a transient simulation with the NCAR CCMO GCM at coarse resolution (R15) 
  (Meehl and Washington, 1996), Kothavala (1999) found for northeastern and southeastern 
  Australia that the Palmer Drought Severity Index indicated longer and more severe 
  droughts in the transient simulation at about 2xCO<sub>2</sub> conditions than 
  in the control simulation. This is consistent with a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  average climate in the enhanced greenhouse simulation; it contrasts with a more 
  ambivalent result by Whetton <i>et al.</i> (1993), who used results from several 
  slab-ocean GCMs and a simple soil water balance model. Similar but less extreme 
  results were found by Walsh <i>et al.</i> (2000) for estimates of meteorological 
  drought in Queensland, based on simulations with the CSIRO RCM at 60-km resolution, 
  nested in the CSIRO Mk2 GCM.</p>
<p>A global study by Arnell (1999), using results from an ensemble of four enhanced 
  greenhouse simulations with the HadCM2 GCM and one with HadCM3, show marked 
  decreases in runoff over most of mainland Australia, including a range of decreases 
  in runoff in the Murray-Darling basin in the southeast by the 2050s of about 
  12-35%. HadCM3 results show large decreases in maximum and minimum monthly 
  runoff. This implies large increases in drought frequency. </p>
<p>The decrease in rainfall predicted for the east of New Zealand by downscaling 
  from coupled AOGCM runs for 2080 and the corresponding increase in temperature 
  are likely to lead to more drought in eastern regions, from East Cape down to 
  Southern Canterbury. Eastern droughts also could be favored by any move of the 
  tropical Pacific into a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like mean state (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>). The sensitivity of New Zealand agriculture and the economy to drought 
  events was illustrated by the 1997-1998 El Ni&ntilde;o drought, which was 
  estimated to result in a loss of NZ$618 million (0.9%) in GDP that year. A drought 
  in north and central Otago and dry conditions in Southland associated with the 
  1998-1999 La Ni&ntilde;a resulted in a loss of about NZ$539 million in 
  GDP (MAF, 2000).</p>
<p>Recurring interest in Australia in policies on drought and disaster relief 
  is evidence of a problem in managing existing climate variability and attempts 
  to adapt (O'Meagher <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Present variability causes fluctuations 
  in Australian GDP on the order of 1-2% (White, 2000). Drought and disaster 
  relief helps immediate victims and their survival as producers (e.g., QDPI, 
  1996) but does not reduce costs to the whole community and in fact may prolong 
  unsuitable or maladapted practices (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Daly, 1994), 
  especially if there is climatic change. Farm productivity models are being used 
  to simulate past and present farm production and to assess causes of and management 
  options for coping with drought (Donnelly <i>et al.</i>, 1998). This is contributing 
  to the fashioning of drought assistance and advisory policies.</p>
<p>The potential impact of drought on the Australian economy has declined, in 
  relative economic terms, over time in parallel with the decline in the importance 
  of agriculture to the economy (ABARE, 1997; Wilson and Johnson, 1997). In 1950-1951, 
  the farm sector constituted 26.1% of GDP, whereas currently (1997-1998) 
  it constitutes 2.5%. Similarly, the contribution of the farm sector to Australian 
  exports has fallen from 85.3% (1950-1951) to 19.6% (1997-1998), with 
  a reduction in the total farm sector labor force of about 6%. This despite the 
  fact that farm production has increased over the same period. Thus, drought 
  remains an important issue throughout Australia for social, political, geographical, 
  and environmental reasons (Gibbs and Maher, 1967; West and Smith, 1996; Flood 
  and Peacock, 1999).</p>
<p>Stehlik <i>et al.</i> (1999) studied the impact of the 1990 drought on more 
  than 100 individuals from 56 properties in central Queensland and northern NSW 
  to document the social experiences of dealing with drought. They conclude that 
  there is strong evidence that the impact of the extended drought of the 1990s 
  is such that rural Australia will never be the same again: "There is a 
  decline in population: a closing down of small businesses, fewer and fewer opportunities 
  for casual or itinerant work, more and more producers working &#145;off-farm' 
  and a reduction in available services."</p>
<p>A change in climate toward drier conditions as a result of lower rainfall and 
  higher evaporative demand would trigger more frequent or longer drought declarations 
  under current Australian drought policy schemes, which rely on historical climate 
  data and/or land-use practices on the basis of an expectation of historical 
  climatic variability. A major issue for operational drought schemes is the choice 
  of the most relevant historical period for the relative assessment of current 
  conditions (Donnelly <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>Examples of Australian government involvement in rural industries that have 
  been subject to decline in commodity prices over several decades (e.g., wool) 
  suggest that the industries will be supported until the cost to the overall 
  community is too high and the long duration or high frequency of drought declarations 
  is perceived as evidence that the drought policy is no longer appropriate (Mercer, 
  1991; Daly, 1994). In the case of wool, the shift of government policy from 
  that of support to facilitation of restructuring has involved a judgment about 
  future demand and therefore prices (McLachlan <i>et al.</i>, 1999) and has only 
  occurred after an extended period of low prices (Johnston <i>et al.</i>, 1999). 
  With a change in climate toward drier conditions, drought policy probably would 
  follow a similar path. </p>
<p>The New Zealand Government response to drought comes under Adverse Climatic 
  Events and Natural Disasters Relief policy that was released in 1995. Government 
  responds only when rare climatic or natural disasters occur on a scale that 
  will seriously impact the national or regional economy and the scale of the 
  response required is beyond the capacity of local resources. The policy is to 
  encourage industry/community/ individual response, rather than reliance on government 
  support.</p>
<p>Science has a major role in assessing the probability that recent and current 
  climatic conditions could be the result of natural variability or increased 
  GHGs. At best, these assessments are presented in probabilistic terms (e.g., 
  Trenberth and Hoar, 1997). The public and its representatives will have to judge 
  what constitutes evidence of anthropogenic effects and to what extent future 
  projections and their impacts should be acted on. Because of their impact, future 
  droughts provide a very public focus for assessing the issues of climate change 
  compared to natural variability. Appropriate land-use and management practices 
  can be reassessed by using agricultural system models with CO<sub>2</sub> and 
  climate projections from GCMs (Hall <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Howden <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999f; Johnston <i>et al.</i>, 1999). However, political judgments between the 
  alternatives of supporting existing land use or facilitating reconstruction 
  are likely to require greater certainty with regard to the accuracy of GCMs 
  than is currently available (Henderson-Sellers, 1993). </p>
<p>One source of adaptation is seasonal and long-lead climate forecasting. This 
  is one area in which climate science already is contributing to better agricultural 
  management, profitability, and, to some extent, adaptation to climate change 
  (Hammer <i>et al.</i>, 1991, 2000; Stone and McKeon, 1992; Stone <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996a; Johnston <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Indeed, empirical forecasting systems 
  already are revealing the impact of global warming trends (Nicholls <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996b; Stone <i>et al.</i>, 1996b), and these systems already are adapting to 
  climate change through regular revision and improvements in forecasting skill.

<h3>12.5.7. Pests and Diseases</h3>
<p>Cropping, horticulture, and forestry in Australia and New Zealand are vulnerable 
  to invasion by new pests and pathogens for which there are no local biological 
  controls (Sutherst <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Ministry for the Environment, 1997). 
  The likelihood that such pests and pathogens&#151;particularly those of tropical 
  or semi-tropical origin&#151;will become established, once introduced to New 
  Zealand, may increase with climate warming. </p>
<p>Indepth case studies are being conducted in Australia to test the performance 
  of pest impact assessment methodologies for estimating the vulnerability of 
  local rural industries to pests under climate change (Sutherst <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). In New Zealand, pests that already are present may extend their ranges 
  and cause more severe damage. For example, because of the reduced incidence 
  of frosts in the north of New Zealand in recent years, the tropical grass webworm 
  (<i>Herpetogramma licarisalis</i>) has increased in numbers and caused severe 
  damage in some pastures in the far north.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of horticultural industries in Australia to the Queensland 
  fruit fly <i>Bactrocera (Dacus) tryoni</i> under climate change was examined 
  by Sutherst <i>et al.</i> (2000). Vulnerability was defined in terms of sensitivity 
  and adaptation options. Regional estimates of fruit fly density, derived with 
  the CLIMEX model, were fed into an economic model that took account of the costs 
  of damage, management, regulation, and research. Sensitivity analyses were used 
  to estimate potential future costs under climate change by recalculating costs 
  with increases in temperature of 0.5, 1.0, and 2&deg;C, assuming that the fruit 
  fly will occur only in horticulture where there is sufficient rainfall or irrigation 
  to allow the crop to grow. The most affected areas were the high-altitude apple-growing 
  areas of southern Queensland and NSW and orange-growing areas in the Murrumbidgee 
  Irrigation Area. Apples and pears in southern and central NSW also were affected. 
  A belt from southern NSW across northern Victoria and into South Australia appeared 
  to be the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Adaptation options were investigated by considering, first, their sustainability 
  under present conditions and, second, their robustness under climate variability 
  and climate change. Bait spraying is ranked as the most sustainable, robust, 
  and hence most promising adaptation option in boh the endemic and fruit fly 
  exclusion zones, but it causes some public concern. The sterile insect technique 
  is particularly safe, but there were concerns about costs, particularly with 
  large infestations. Exclusion is a highly effective approach for minimizing 
  the number of outbreaks of Queensland fruit fly in fly-free areas, although 
  it is vulnerable to political pressure in relation to tourism. These three techniques 
  have been given the highest priority.</p>
