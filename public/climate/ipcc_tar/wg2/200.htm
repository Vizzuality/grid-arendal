<p><b>Inland Wetlands</b><br>
</p>
<p>Wetlands play an important role in maintaining biological diversity by providing 
  a habitat for many plant and animal species, some of which are endemic or endangered. 
  They also have significant scientific value that goes beyond their plant and 
  animal communities. Peat-accumulating wetlands are important for global change 
  because of the large carbon store accumulated over the millennia and the risk 
  that this store would be released to the atmosphere in conditions modified by 
  global change. Besides being carbon sinks, wetlands are sources of methane to 
  the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>We can state with high confidence that the pressures of climate change on habitat, 
  biodiversity, and carbon sink on most wetland types will be largely indirect, 
  operating through changes in water level. On peatlands underlain by permafrost, 
  however, direct temperature impacts can be more important. Food and fiber production 
  are ecosystem services that simultaneously form a pressure (land-use change) 
  on other services (habitat, biodiversity, carbon sink).</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities </i> 
<ul>
  <li>A warmer, drier climate is not necessarily likely to lead to a large loss 
    of stored peat for all peatland types (e.g., boreal peatlands), but there 
    are competing explanations because feedback mechanisms between climate and 
    peatland hydrology and the autogenic nature of peatland development are poorly 
    understood.</li>
  <li>Peatlands underlain by permafrost are likely to become net carbon sources 
    rather than sinks, mainly because of melting of permafrost and lowering of 
    the water table (high confidence). Work in tussock and wet tundra has shown 
    that these systems already may be net annual sources of 0.19 Gt C.</li>
  <li>Extensive seasonally inundated freshwater swamps, which are major biodiversity 
    foci, could be displaced if predicted sea-level rises of 10-30 cm by 
    2030 occur (high confidence).</li>
  <li>In the southeast Asian region, droughts in recent years related to ENSO 
    events have lowered local water tables and thus increased the severity of 
    fires in tropical peatlands (high confidence).</li>
  <li>The effects of water-level drawdown after drainage for forestry indicate 
    that the shift in species composition from wetland species to forest species 
    only slightly affects plant species richness of individual sites; in regions 
    dominated by forests, however, there would be a clear reduction in regional 
    diversity as landscapes become homogenized after water-level drawdown (medium 
    confidence).</li>
  <li>Most wetland processes are dependent on catchment-level hydrology. Thus, 
    adaptations to projected climate change may be practically impossible. For 
    degrading key habitats, small-scale restoration may be possible if sufficient 
    water is available.</li>
  <li>Arctic and subarctic ombrotrophic bog communities on permafrost, together 
    with more southern depressional wetlands with small catchment areas, are likely 
    to be most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing speed of peatland 
    conversion and drainage in southeast Asia is likely to place these areas at 
    a greatly increased risk of fires and affect the viability of tropical wetlands.</li>
</ul>
<b>Arctic and Alpine Ecosystems </b>
<p>Observations show that high-latitude warming has occurred in the Arctic region 
  since the 1960s. Precipitation and surface evaporation have increased at high 
  latitudes. Permafrost temperatures have warmed in western North America by 2-4&deg;C 
  from 1940 and in Siberia by 0.6-0.7&deg;C from 1970 to 1990, whereas permafrost 
  cooled in northeastern Canada. These patterns roughly parallel recent trends 
  in air temperature. Carbon flux measurements in Alaska suggest that the recent 
  warming trend may have converted tundra from a net carbon sink to a source of 
  as much as 0.7 Gt C y<sup>r-1</sup>. During recent decades, the peak-to-trough 
  amplitude in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  has increased, and the phase has advanced at arctic and subarctic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  observation stations north of 55&deg;N. This change in carbon dynamics in the 
  atmosphere probably reflects some combination of increased uptake during the 
  first half of the growing season&#151;which could explain the observed increase 
  in biomass of some shrubs, increased winter efflux, and increased seasonality 
  of carbon exchange associated with disturbance. This "inverse" approach 
  generally has concluded that mid-northern latitudes were a net carbon sink during 
  the 1980s and early 1990s. At high northern latitudes, these models give a wider 
  range of estimates; some analyses point to a net and others to a sink. </p>
<p>Climatic changes observed in alpine areas generally have paralleled climatic 
  patterns in surrounding regions, with the most pronounced warming at high latitudes, 
  in the Alps, and in Asia and the least pronounced changes in tropical alpine 
  regions. Precipitation generally has increased, with the most pronounced changes 
  in winter, leading to increased snow depth. Regional trends in climate have 
  led to shrinkage of alpine and subpolar glaciers equivalent to 0.25 &plusmn; 
  0.1 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> of sea-level change&#151;or 16% of the sea-level rise 
  in the past 100 years. Net mass reduction of the alpine glaciers has been most 
  pronounced since 1980, when regional warming was greatest. Climatic warming 
  observed in the Alps has been associated with upward movement of some plant 
  taxa of 1-4 m per decade on mountaintops and the loss of some taxa that 
  formerly were restricted to high elevations. In general, direct human impacts 
  on alpine vegetation from grazing, tourism, and nitrogen deposition are so strong 
  that climatic effects on the goods and services provided by alpine ecosystems 
  are difficult to detect.</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities </i> 
<ul>
  <li>Projected climatic warming of 4-10&deg;C by the end of the 21st century 
    is likely to cause substantial increases in decomposition, nutrient release, 
    and primary production (high confidence). Many of these changes in productivity 
    may be threshold effects; they also may be mediated by changes in species 
    composition and therefore are likely to lag changes in climate by years, decades, 
    or centuries (medium confidence). </li>
  <li>Important changes in diversity in the Arctic include changes in the abundance 
    of caribou, waterfowl, and other subsistence resources (medium confidence). 
  </li>
  <li>Tundra has a three- to six-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, 
    but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems 
    within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes (high 
    confidence). Changes in albedo and energy absorption during winter are likely 
    to act as a positive feedback to regional warming.</li>
  <li>Disturbances such as fires are likely to change with changes in regional 
    climate and affect biophysical properties (high confidence).</li>
  <li>In alpine areas, warming is likely to create a shortened snowmelt season, 
    with rapid water release creating floods and later growing-season droughts, 
    affecting productivity in these areas (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>Changes in goods and services in alpine ecosystems are likely to be dominated 
    by changes in land use associated with grazing, recreation, and other direct 
    impacts because of their proximity to population centers (high confidence). 
    Many of the alpine zones with greatest biodiversity, such as the Caucasus 
    and Himalayas, are areas where human population pressures may lead to most 
    pronounced land-use change. Overgrazing, trampling, and nutrient/pollution 
    deposition may tend to destabilize vegetation, leading to erosion and loss 
    of soils that are the long-term basis of the productive capacity of alpine 
    ecosystems. </li>
  <li>Opportunities for adapting to expected changes in Arctic and alpine ecosystems 
    are limited because these systems will respond most strongly to globally induced 
    changes in climate (medium confidence). Opportunities for mitigation will 
    include protection of peatlands, yedoma sediments, and other carbon-rich areas 
    from large-scale hydrological change, land use, and pollutant levels. Careful 
    management of wildlife resources could minimize climatic impacts on indigenous 
    peoples. Many Arctic regions depend strongly on one or a few resources, such 
    as timber, oil, reindeer, or wages from fighting fires. Economic diversification 
    would reduce the impacts of large changes in the availability or economic 
    value of particular goods and services.</li>
  <li>The goods and services provided by many Arctic regions depend on the physical 
    integrity of permafrost and therefore are vulnerable to climate change (high 
    confidence). The large carbon stocks in these regions are vulnerable to loss 
    to the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub> or methane. </li>
  <li>The high levels of endemism in many alpine floras and their inability to 
    migrate upward means that these species are most vulnerable (medium confidence).</li>
