<h2>9.3. Sensitivity, Vulnerability, and Adaptation</h2>
<p>There are uncertainties regarding the sensitivity (i.e., rate of change of 
  the outcome variable per unit change in the input/ exposure variable) of many 
  health outcomes to climate or climate-induced environmental changes. Relatively 
  little quantitative research, with estimation of exposure-response relationships, 
  has been done for outcomes other than death rates associated with thermal stress 
  and changes in the transmission potential of several vector-borne infectious 
  diseases. There has been increased effort to map the current distribution of 
  vectors and diseases such as malaria by using climate and other environmental 
  data (including satellite data). </p>
<p>Continuation of recent climatic trends soon may result in some shifts in the 
  geographic range and seasonality of diseases such as malaria and dengue. In 
  reality, however, such shifts also would depend on local topographical and ecological 
  circumstances, other determinants of local population vulnerability, and the 
  existence and level of adaptive public health defenses. There has been some 
  recent debate in the scientific literature about whether there is any evidence 
  of such shifts yet (Epstein <i>et al</i>., 1997; Mouchet <i>et al</i>., 1998; 
  Reiter, 1998a,b). It is not yet clear what criteria are most appropriate for 
  assessment of climatic influences on such changes in infectious disease patterns. 
  A balance is needed between formal, statistically based analysis of changes 
  within a particular local setting and a more synthesizing assessment of the 
  consistency of patterns across diverse settings and across different systems&#151;physical, 
  biotic, social, and public health. As with climate change itself, there is an 
  inherent difficulty in detecting small climate-induced shifts in population 
  health outcomes and in attributing the shift to a change in climate. <br>
  <br>
  Population vulnerability is a function of the extent to which a health outcome 
  in that particular environmental-demographic setting is sensitive to climate 
  change and the capacity of the population to adapt to new climate conditions. 
  Determinants of population vulnerability to climate-related threats to health 
  include level of material resources, effectiveness of governance and civil institutions, 
  quality of public health infrastructure, access to relevant local information 
  on extreme weather threats, and preexisting burden of disease (Woodward <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998). Thus, vulnerability is determined by individual, community, 
  and geographical factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individual factors include: 
    <ul>
      <li>Disease status (people with preexisting cardiovascular disease, for 
        example, may be more vulnerable to direct effects such as heat waves).</li>
      <li>Socioeconomic factors (in general, the poor are more vulnerable).</li>
      <li>Demographic factors (the elderly are more vulnerable to heat waves, 
        for example, and infants are more vulnerable to diarrheal diseases).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Community factors may include: 
    <ul>
      <li>Integrity of water and sanitation systems and their capacity to resist 
        extreme events.</li>
      <li>Local food supplies and distribution systems.</li>
      <li>Access to information, including early warnings of extreme climate events.</li>
      <li>Local disease vector distribution and control programs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Geographical factors may include: 
    <ul>
      <li>The influence of El Ni&ntilde;o cycle or the occurrence of extreme weather 
        events that are more common in some parts of the world.</li>
      <li>Low-lying coastal populations more vulnerable to the effects of sea-level 
        rise.</li>
      <li>Populations bordering current distributions of vector-borne disease 
        particularly vulnerable to changes in distribution.</li>
      <li>Rural residents often with less access to adequate health care, and 
        urban residents more vulnerable to air pollution and heat island effects.</li>
      <li>Environmentally degraded and deforested areas more vulnerable to extreme 
        weather events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding a population's capacity to adapt to new climate conditions is 
  crucial to realistic assessment of the potential health impacts of climate change 
  (Smithers and Smit, 1997). This issue is addressed more fully in <a href="370.htm">Section 
  9.11</a>.</p>
