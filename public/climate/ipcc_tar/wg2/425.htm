<h3>11.1.4. Sensitivity, Key Vulnerabilities, and Adaptability </h3>
<h4><a name="11141"></a>11.1.4.1. Sensitivity and Key Vulnerabilities</h4>
<p>An examination and analysis of the climate change-induced vulnerabilities in 
  Asia has to be undertaken against the backdrop of the physical, economic, and 
  social environment of the countries in the region. They provide not only the 
  benchmark against which vulnerabilities are to be assessed but also the potential 
  for adaptation to them. Surface water and groundwater resources in Asian countries 
  play vital roles in forestry, agriculture, fisheries, livestock production, 
  and industrial activity. The water and agriculture sectors are likely to be 
  most sensitive to climate change-induced impacts in Asia. </p>
<p>As reported in IPCC (1998), climate change in boreal Asia could have serious 
  effects on climate-dependent sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and water 
  resources. Climate change and human activities, for example, may influence the 
  levels of the Caspian and Aral Seas, with implications for the vulnerability 
  of natural and social systems (Kelly et al., 1983; Golubtsov et al., 1996; Popov 
  and Rice, 1997). The increase in surface temperature will have favorable effects 
  on agriculture in the northernmost regions of Asia, and a general northward 
  shift of crop zones is expected. However, as much as a 30% decrease in cereal 
  production from the main agriculture regions of boreal Asia by 2050 has been 
  projected (Budyko and Menzhulin, 1996; ICRF, 1998). A decrease in agriculture 
  productivity of about 20% also is suggested in southwestern Siberia (ICRF, 1998). 
  Forest ecosystems in boreal Asia could suffer from floods and increased volume 
  of runoff, as well as melting of permafrost regions. Model-based assessments 
  suggest that significant northward shifts (up to 400 km) in natural forest zones 
  are likely in the next 50 years (Lelyakin et al., 1997; Serebryanny and Khropov, 
  1997). There also is growing anxiety that significant increases in ultraviolet 
  radiation, as observed in recent years, could have serious implications for 
  ecosystems along the Arctic shore of Siberia (Makarov, 1999; Voskoboynikov, 
  1999; ACIA, 2000).</p>
<p>In arid and semi-arid Asia, the climate limits the portion of land that presently 
  is available for agriculture and livestock production. Croplands in many of 
  the countries in the region are irrigated because rainfall is low and highly 
  variable. The agriculture sector here is potentially highly vulnerable to climate 
  change because of degradation of the limited arable land. Almost two-thirds 
  of domestic livestock are supported on rangelands, although in some countries 
  a significant share of animal fodder also comes from crop residues (IPCC, 1998). 
  The combination of elevated temperature and decreased precipitation in arid 
  and semi-arid rangelands could cause a manifold increase in potential evapotranspiration, 
  leading to severe water-stress conditions. Many desert organisms are near their 
  limits of temperature tolerance. Because of the current marginality of soil-water 
  and nutrient reserves, some ecosystems in semi-arid regions may be among the 
  first to show the effects of climate change. Climate change has the potential 
  to exacerbate the loss of biodiversity in this region. </p>
<p>The major impacts of global warming in temperate Asia will be large northward 
  shifts of subtropical crop areas. Large increases in surface runoff&#151;leading 
  to soil erosion and degradation, frequent waterlogging in the south, and spring 
  droughts in the north&#151;ultimately will affect agriculture productivity (Arnell, 
  1999). As reported in IPCC (1998), the volume of runoff from glaciers in central 
  Asia may increase three-fold by 2050. Permafrost in northeast China is expected 
  to disappear if temperatures increase by 2&deg;C or more. The northern part 
  of China would be most vulnerable to hydrological impacts of climate change; 
  future population growth and economic development here may exacerbate seriously 
  the existing water shortage. Deltaic coasts in China would face severe problems 
  from sea-level rise. Sea-level rise also will expand the flood-prone area and 
  exacerbate beach erosion in Japan. </p>
<p>In monsoon Asia, the issue of sensitivity of physical and natural systems to 
  the hydrological cycle is linked to major stresses caused by projected climate 
  change on agricultural production and increased exposure of social and economic 
  systems to impacts of extreme events, including forest die-back and increased 
  fire risk; typhoons and tropical storms; floods and landslide; and human disease 
  impacts. These stresses on physical systems translate into key social vulnerabilities, 
  particularly in combination with unsustainable utilization of resources. For 
  example, the drawing down of groundwater resources has increased the rate of 
  relative sea-level change for many of the major cities of coastal Asia, such 
  as Bangkok and Shanghai&#151;thereby increasing the risk from climate change-induced 
  sea-level rise (Jarupongsakul, 1999). Conversion of natural forests to palm 
  oil plantations in many southeast Asian countries during recent decades (particularly 
  Indonesia and Malaysia) increased the probability of uncontrolled forest fires 
  and increased health and biodiversity impacts during the 1997 ENSO event (Yim, 
  1999; Barber and Schweithelm, 2000). The ecological security of mangroves and 
  coral reefs may be put at risk by climate change. Sea-level rise could cause 
  large-scale inundation along the coastline and recession of flat sandy beaches 
  of south and southeast Asia. Monsoons in tropical Asia could become more variable 
  if ENSO events become stronger and more frequent in a warmer atmosphere (Webster 
  and Yang, 1992; Webster et al. 1998).</p>
<p>Vulnerability relates to social or natural systems and is delineated as such. 
  The issues of social and physical vulnerability to climate change are directly 
  related because the major sensitivities of ecological and natural systems across 
  the regions of Asia translate into risks to socioeconomic systems. Social vulnerability 
  is defined as the degree to which individuals or groups are susceptible to impacts; 
  the determinants of social vulnerability are exposure to stress as a result 
  of the impacts of climate change and the underlying social position (Adger, 
  1999a). On this basis, the key social vulnerabilities in the Asian context occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where resource-dependent communities have their resilience undermined by 
    increased exposure to the physical stresses in water availability, agricultural 
    impact, and other sensitivities mentioned above</li>
  <li>Where sustainability and equity (Munasinghe, 2000) are sacrificed for economic 
    growth, exposing larger parts of the population to impacts.</li>
</ul>
