<h2>1.4. How are Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability Assessed in this Report? 
</h2>
<p>An important new category of issues on climatic impacts pertains to methodological 
  advances; <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> provides more details. These advances 
  include methods for assessing impacts and vulnerability, methods for detecting 
  biotic response to climate change in natural ecological systems by using indicator 
  species, and detection and attribution of observed changes in environmental 
  systems to climatic changes, as distinct from other possible causal factors 
  (<a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Other new methods relate to costing and valuation, 
  decision analytic techniques and frameworks, uncertainties assessment, and consistent 
  characterization of levels of confidence that could be attached to observations 
  or conclusions (see <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a> and <a href="068.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). All of these developments extend methodological considerations beyond 
  those typically employed in the SAR. Development and application of regional-scale 
  scenarios to climate change impacts, adaptations, and vulnerability (as described 
  in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>) represent a new emphasis of a technique 
  that was limited in the SAR to the science of climate change. The directive 
  in the IPCC's charge to Working Group II to emphasize regional issues is reflected 
  in the eight regional chapters (<a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). 
  This directive calls for utilization of new advances in knowledge, including 
  integrated methods, to assess the most cost-effective approaches to adapt to 
  changes in climate at the regional level. This section elaborates briefly on 
  several issues that are related to assessment of impacts, vulnerability, and 
  adaptation and illustrates several of the foregoing methodological considerations.</p>

<p><a name="fig12"></a>This report assesses recent advances in our understanding 
  of the vulnerability of major sectors, systems, and regions to climate change. 
  Consistent with common usage and definitions in the SAR, vulnerability is defined 
  as the extent to which a natural or social system is susceptible to sustaining 
  damage from climate change. Vulnerability is a function of the sensitivity of 
  a system to changes in climate (the degree to which a system will respond to 
  a given change in climate, including beneficial and harmful effects), adaptive 
  capacity (the degree to which adjustments in practices, processes, or structures 
  can moderate or offset the potential for damage or take advantage of opportunities 
  created by a given change in climate), and the degree of exposure of the system 
  to climatic hazards (<a href="#fig12">Figure 1-2</a>). Under this framework, 
  a highly vulnerable system would be a system that is very sensitive to modest 
  changes in climate, where the sensitivity includes the potential for substantial 
  harmful effects, and for which the ability to adapt is severely constrained. 
  Resilience is the flip side of vulnerability-a resilient system or population 
  is not sensitive to climate variability and change and has the capacity to adapt. 
</p>
<p>Adaptation is recognized as a crucial response because even if current agreements 
  to limit emissions are implemented, they will not stabilize atmospheric concentrations 
  of GHG emissions and climate (Wigley, 1998). Hence, adaptation is considered 
  here, along with mitigation-the more widely considered response to climate change-as 
  a key component of an integrated and balanced response to climate variability 
  and change (MacIver, 1998). Adaptations, which can be autonomous or policy-driven, 
  are adjustments in practices, processes, or structures to take account of changing 
  climate conditions. Impacts, however, sometimes are difficult to identify, let 
  alone quantify, in part because of the nonlinear nature of climate change itself. 
  Impacts can be subtle but nonetheless significant, and their consequences can 
  differ for different members of the same community-as when some individuals 
  or groups perceive an opportunity with change and others experience a loss, 
  thereby changing community dynamics and complicating decisions about how to 
  adapt and the apportionment of costs of adaptation. Negative impacts often are 
  observed as chance occurrences (surprises) beyond critical values (thresholds) 
  of accustomed weather parameters. They can be conceived as risks or the "probability 
  of occurrence of a damaging event," such as flood, drought, strong winds, heat 
  wave, subfreezing temperatures, or forest or bush fire. "The extent to which 
  natural ecosystems, global food supplies and sustainable development are in 
  danger depends partly on the nature of climate change and partly on the ability 
  of the impacted systems to adapt" to these events (Smit et al., 1999). </p>
<p>The capacity of a sector or region to adapt to climatic changes depends on 
  several factors (see <a href="#fig12">Figure 1-2</a> and <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>). The literature emphasizes that studies that neglect adaptive potential 
  are likely to overestimate the costs of climatic impacts (e.g., Reilly et al., 
  1996). However, more recent literature also notes that maladaptations are possible-particularly 
  when information about future climatic and other conditions is much less than 
  perfect-as a response to an incorrect perception of such changes, often driven 
  by a masking of slowly evolving trends by large natural variability or extreme 
  events (West and Dowlatabadi, 1999; Schneider et al., 2000a; West et al., 2001). 
  Maladaptations can increase the costs of impacts relative to those when adaptive 
  agents have perfect foresight or when adaptive responses are absent. On the 
  other hand, appropriate adaptations can reduce negative impacts or take advantage 
  of new opportunities presented by changing climate conditions. The SAR assessed 
  technical options for adaptation but did not evaluate the feasibility of these 
  options for different regions and circumstances because little information was 
  available in the literature. The Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate 
  Change focuses to a greater extent on the regional dimensions of adaptation; 
  because the report is based largely on the SAR, as well as early and preliminary 
  results from country studies and national communications to the UNFCCC, however, 
  many questions about the capacities required to implement theoretically promising 
  adaptation options remain. Hence, in this report, greater attention has been 
  focused on societal determinants of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. To 
  the extent possible, the report seeks to examine information in the literature 
  on the interaction of these factors to develop options for bolstering adaptive 
  capacity. Previous IPCC assessments conclude that most systems are sensitive 
  to the magnitude and the rate of climate change. Sensitive systems include, 
  for example, aspects of food and fiber production, water resources, ecosystems 
  of all types, coastal systems, human settlements, and human health. This sensitivity 
  includes adverse effects in many regions, as well as potentially beneficial 
  effects in some regions and sectors (high confidence). Social systems generally 
  are more resilient than natural systems because of the potential for deliberate 
  adaptation (high confidence). However, confidence in most specific aggregate 
  estimates of impacts remains low because of uncertainties and complexities of 
  analysis (as detailed further in succeeding sections). </p>
<p>For systems that already are exposed to increasing resource demands, unsustainable 
  management, and pollution, exposure to climate change is an important additional 
  pressure. Systems that are exposed to multiple pressures (synergistic effects) 
  usually are more vulnerable to climate change than systems that are not (high 
  confidence). </p>
