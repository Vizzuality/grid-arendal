<h2>3.4. Environmental Scenarios</h2>
<h3><a name="341"></a>3.4.1. Purpose</h3>
<p>Observations during the 20th century have demonstrated clearly the multifaceted 
  nature of anthropogenic environmental changes. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
  expect that changes in climate anticipated for the future will occur in combination 
  with other changes in the environment. Some of these changes will occur independently 
  of climate change (e.g., groundwater depletion, acidification); others are a 
  cause of climate change (e.g., changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration); 
  and still others are a direct consequence of climate change (e.g., sea-level 
  rise). All of these could have a role in modifying the impacts of future climate 
  change. Hence, realistic scenarios of nonclimatic environmental factors are 
  required to facilitate analysis of these combined effects and quantify them 
  in impact assessments. </p>
<p>This section introduces environmental changes that are of importance at scales 
  from subcontinental to global and describes how scenarios commonly are constructed 
  to represent them. Requirements for environmental scenarios are highly application- 
  and region-specific. For example, scenarios of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  may be important in considering future vegetation productivity under a changing 
  climate but are unlikely to be required for assessment of human health impacts. 
  Most of the scenarios treated here relate to atmospheric composition: CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  SO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur and nitrogen deposition, tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, 
  and surface UV-B radiation. Scenarios of water resources and marine pollution 
  also are examined. Changes in the terrestrial environment are addressed in <a href="132.htm">Section 
  3.3</a>, and changes in sea level are addressed in <a href="148.htm">Section 
  3.6</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="342"></a>3.4.2. CO<sub>2</sub> Scenarios</h3>
<h4><a name="3421"></a>3.4.2.1. Reference Conditions</h4>
<p>Aside from its dominant role as a greenhouse gas, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  also has an important direct effect on many organisms, stimulating photosynthetic 
  productivity and affecting water-use efficiency in many terrestrial plants. 
  In 1999, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the surface layer of the atmosphere 
  (denoted as [CO<sub>2</sub>]) was about 367 ppm (see <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>), 
  compared with a concentration of approximately 280 ppm in preindustrial times 
  (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/095.htm">Chapter 3</a>). CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is well mixed in the atmosphere, and, although concentrations vary somewhat 
  by region and season (related to seasonal uptake by vegetation), projections 
  of global mean annual concentrations usually suffice for most impact applications. 
  Reference levels of [CO<sub>2</sub>] between 300 and 360 ppm have been widely 
  adopted in CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment experiments (Cure and Acock, 1986; Poorter, 1993; 
  see <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>) and in model-based impact studies. 
  [CO<sub>2</sub>] has increased rapidly during the 20th century, and plant growth 
  response could be significant for responsive plants, although the evidence for 
  this from long-term observations of plants is unclear because of the confounding 
  effects of other factors such as nitrogen deposition and soil fertility changes 
  (Kirschbaum <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<h4><a name="3422"></a>3.4.2.2. Development and Application of [CO<sub>2</sub>] 
  Scenarios</h4>
<p>Projections of [CO<sub>2</sub>] are obtained in two stages: first, the rate 
  of emissions from different sources is evaluated; second, concentrations are 
  evaluated from projected emissions and sequestration of carbon. Because CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is a major greenhouse gas, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been projected in successive 
  IPCC scenarios (Scenarios A-D&#151;Shine <i>et al</i>., 1990; IS92 scenarios&#151;Leggett 
  <i>et al</i>., 1992; SRES scenarios&#151;Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 2000). To 
  obtain scenarios of future [CO<sub>2</sub>] from those of emissions, global 
  models of the carbon cycle are required (e.g., Schimel <i>et al</i>., 1995). 
  Some estimates of [CO<sub>2</sub>] for the SRES emissions scenarios are given 
  in <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in emissions scenarios that 
  lead to [CO<sub>2</sub>] stabilization (see <a href="156.htm">Section 3.8.4</a>). 
  Typically, levels of [CO<sub>2</sub>] stabilized between 350 and 1000 ppm have 
  been examined; these levels usually are achieved during the 22nd or 23rd century, 
  except under the most stringent emissions targets (Schimel <i>et al</i>., 1997a). 
  Work to develop storylines for a set of stabilization scenarios is reported 
  in <a href="../wg3/068.htm">Chapter 2</a> of <a href="../wg3/index.htm">WGIII</a>. Whatever scenarios emerge, it is 
  likely to be some time before a set of derivative CO<sub>2</sub>-stabilization 
  impact and adaptation assessments are completed, although a few exploratory 
  studies already have been conducted (UK-DETR, 1999).</p>
<p>Experimental CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment studies conventionally compare responses 
  of an organism for a control concentration representing current [CO<sub>2</sub>] 
  with responses for a fixed concentration assumed for the future. In early studies 
  this was most commonly a doubling (Cure and Acock, 1986), to coincide with equilibrium 
  climate model experiments (see <a href="142.htm">Section 3.5</a>). However, 
  more recent transient treatment of future changes, along with the many uncertainties 
  surrounding estimates of future [CO<sub>2</sub>] and future climate, present 
  an infinite number of plausible combinations of future conditions. For example, 
  <a href="135.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a> illustrates the range of [CO<sub>2</sub>] 
  projected for 2050 and 2100 under the SRES emissions scenarios, using simple 
  models. To cover these possibilities, although doubled [CO<sub>2</sub>] experiments 
  are still common, alternative concentrations also are investigated (Olesen, 
  1999)&#151;often in combination with a range of climatic conditions, by using 
  devices such as temperature gradient tunnels (Wheeler <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
