<h3><a name="1724"></a>17.2.4. Coral Reefs, Mangroves, and Seagrasses </h3>
<h4><a name="17241"></a>17.2.4.1. Coral Reefs</h4>
<p>Coral reefs represent one of the most important natural resources of many tropical 
  islands. They are a source of food, beach sand, and building materials and function 
  as natural breakwaters along the coasts of many tropical islands. They also 
  provide habitats for many marine animals and reef fish and generate significant 
  revenues for many small island economies through avenues such as tourism (e.g., 
  snorkeling and scuba diving). On many islands, coral reefs are facing severe 
  threats from climate- and non-climate-related stressors. The total areal extent 
  of living coral reefs has been estimated at about 255,000-1,500,000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  (Spalding and Grenfell, 1997), of which 58% are considered at risk from human 
  activities, according to a global assessment (Bryant <i>et al.,</i> 1997).</p>
<p>Owing to their narrow temperature tolerances, some species of corals currently 
  live at or near their thermal limits (Goreau, 1992; IPCC, 1998). SST projections 
  (based on three variants of the Max Planck Institute ECHAM and CSIRO GCMs) suggest 
  that the thermal tolerance of reef-building corals will be exceeded within the 
  next few decades. Moreover, the incidence of bleaching will rise rapidly, with 
  the rate of increase highest in the Caribbean and slowest in the central Pacific 
  region (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). </p>
<p>There is now substantial evidence that indicates that "episodic" warming of 
  the ocean surface, as occurs in El Ni&ntilde;o years, leads to significant coral 
  bleaching (Brown and Ogden, 1993; Glynn, 1993; Goreau and Hayes, 1994; Wilkinson 
  and Buddemeier, 1994; Brown, 1997a,b; CARICOMP, 1997; Goreau <i>et al.,</i> 
  1997). The major coral bleaching episodes in the past 20 years were found to 
  be associated with periods when ocean temperature were about 1&deg;C higher 
  than the summer maximum. It also has been suggested that bleaching events could 
  occur annually in most tropical oceans in the next 30-50 years (Hoegh-Guldberg, 
  1999). Bleaching was particularly severe and widespread during the period of 
  the most recent El Ni&ntilde;o episode of 1997-1998, which was considered to 
  be the most intense such event on record. On some islands, more than 90% of 
  all live reefs have been affected (Goreau and Hayes, 1994), with branching species 
  generally most severely impacted (Wilkinson 1998, 1999). An assessment of the 
  literature on coral bleaching is provided in <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6. </a></p>
<p>The impact of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the oceans on coral 
  reefs is now the focus of an emerging though as yet unresolved debate. Since 
  publication of the SAR and the <i>Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate 
  Change</i> (IPCC, 1998), it has been suggested that the ability of reef plants 
  and animals to make the limestone skeletons that build the reefs is being reduced 
  by rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Indeed, some authors suggest 
  that based on projected CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere, the 
  calcification rate of corals would decline by approximately 14-30% by 2050 (Gattuso 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1999; Kleypas <i>et al., </i>1999). Again, see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> for a full evaluation of the main issues in this debate.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 points out that earlier IPCC assessments have concluded that the 
  threat of sea-level rise to reefs (as opposed to reef islands) is negligible. 
  This conclusion was based on projected rates of global sea-level rise from Warrick 
  et al. (1996) on the order of 2-9 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over the next 100 
  years. It has been suggested that healthy reef flats will be able to keep pace 
  with projected sea-level rise, given an approximate upper limit of vertical 
  reef growth during the Holocene of 10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Schlager, 1999). However, 
  the prognosis is far less positive in many small island states (e.g., in the 
  Caribbean Sea and the Indian Ocean), where reef structures have been weakened 
  by a variety of anthropogenic stresses. This concern also is applicable to many 
  island countries, where reefs in close proximity to major settlements have been 
  severely stressed. The ability of reefs to keep pace with sea-level rise also 
  will be adversely affected by more frequent coral bleaching episodes and by 
  reduced calcification rates resulting from higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>
