<h2><a name="47"></a>4.7. Integration: Water and Other Sectors</h2>
<h3><a name="471"></a>4.7.1. The Nonclimate Context</h3>
<p>The impact of climate change in the water sector is a function of biophysical 
  changes in water quantity and composition, the use to which the water is put, 
  and the way in which those uses are managed. The implications of climate change 
  for water resources therefore must be considered in the context of the many 
  other pressures on water resources and their management. These pressures&#151;and 
  management responses to them&#151;are evolving rapidly, and the water management 
  system (legal, infrastructural, and institutional) in the future may be very 
  different in many countries from that at present. Considerable efforts are underway 
  in many international agencies and organizations (e.g., Global Water Partnership, 
  World Bank) to improve the way water is used and managed; these actions will 
  have very significant consequences not only for economies, access to safe water, 
  and the environment but also for the impacts of climate change. Adaptation to 
  climate change in the water sector must be considered in the context of these 
  other changes&#151;and, of course, climate change must be considered as a factor 
  in the development of improved management techniques.</p>
<h3><a name="472"></a>4.7.2. Water and Other Related Sectors</h3>
<p>Water is a fundamental component of many economic activities. The impact of 
  climate change on the quality and quantity of water therefore will be felt by 
  such economic activities in one way or another. Examples of such linkages are 
  given in the following subsections.</p>
<h4><a name="4721"></a>4.7.2.1. Ecosystems (TAR Chapter 5)</h4>
<p>Changes in hydrological characteristics will lead to changes in aquatic and 
  wetland ecosystems (as reviewed in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>)&#151;as, 
  indeed, may some of the actions taken by water managers to adapt to climate 
  change. In practice, much water management increasingly focuses on ensuring 
  that human use of water does not adversely impact the water environment, and 
  maintaining and enhancing environmental quality is regarded as a legitimate 
  management goal. Environmental demands, of course, will alter as climate changes.</p>
<p>Agriculture also will be affected by water availability, and actions taken 
  by farmers in response to climate change may impact the water environment. For 
  example, climate change may increase demands for irrigation from the agricultural 
  sector, and if these extra needs are withdrawn from rivers or aquifers, there 
  will be an effect on hydrological and ecological regimes: The &#147;direct&#148; 
  effect of climate change on hydrological regimes and ecosystems may be enhanced. 
  On the other hand, a lack of water resulting from climate change might mean 
  that increased irrigation demands cannot be met, and changes in the water sector 
  therefore are impacting directly on agricultural response to climate change. 
  In addition, changes in agricultural land use resulting directly or indirectly 
  from climate change may affect catchment water balance and water quality. These 
  effects may be more substantial than the direct effects of climate change on 
  hydrology.</p>
