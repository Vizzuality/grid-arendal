<h4>8.3.3.2. Natural Catastrophes and Insurer Solvency</h4>
<p>Historical weather-related insolvencies illustrate the vulnerability of large 
  and small insurers to the types of natural disasters that potentially are associated 
  with climate change (Stipp, 1997; Swiss Re, 2000a; Mills <i>et al</i>., 2001). 
  Nearly 650 U.S. insurers became insolvent between 1969 and 1998 (<a href="329.htm#fig84">Figure 
  8-4b</a>) (Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Of the 36 of 426 specifically attributed insolvencies occurring primarily as 
  a result of natural catastrophes, more than half occurred between 1989 and 1993&#151;the 
  period of Hurricanes Hugo, Iniki, and Andrew&#151;despite increased insurer 
  capacity (Davidson, 1997; Doherty, 1997; Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999; Swiss 
  Re, 2000b). Given the multi-factorial nature of most insolvencies, weather-related 
  losses were no doubt a contributing factor in other cases as well. Although 
  small or geographically specialized firms are most vulnerable, insolvencies 
  of larger and more regionally diversified companies have occurred in the European 
  Union (Swiss Re, 2000a) and in the United States (see <a href="579.htm">Section 
  15.2.7</a>). As a result of Hurricane Andrew, the largest U.S. home insurer, 
  State Farm Fire and Casualty, was brought to the brink of insolvency by a US$4 
  billion loss and had to be rescued by its parent company (Stipp, 1997). The 
  second largest U.S. home insurer, Allstate, paid out US$1.9 billion (which was 
  US$500 million more than it had made in profits from its Florida operations 
  from all types of insurance, including investment income, over the 53 years 
  it had been in business) and also had to be rescued by its parent company (III, 
  2000a).</p>
<p>Little analysis of historic insolvencies in relation to natural catastrophes 
  has been conducted outside the United States. Data for property/casualty firms 
  in France, Germany, the UK, and the United States show that annual "baseline" 
  insolvencies range from 0 to 0.5% of all firms to more than 2% in years with 
  larger natural disasters (Swiss Re, 2000a). Natural disasters contributed to 
  the severe difficulties experienced by the London market, including Lloyd's 
  of London's near insolvency.</p>
<p>Future-oriented analyses of insurer solvency also have been conducted; these 
  analyses show PMLs of US$45-100 billion, which&#151;despite several recognized 
  conservatisms in the analyses&#151;would result in serious levels of insolvency 
  in the industry (ISO, 1996; Cummins et al., 1999; Kelly and Zeng, 1999). As 
  many as 45% of insurers in the United States (representing 62% of the market 
  share) could be placed in this position (GAO, 2000a,b). These findings are comparable 
  to an earlier study showing that the rise in PMLs is stretching insurers' 
  adaptive capacity (AIRAC, 1986).</p>
<p>Although much attention is focused on catastrophic loss events, "small" 
  loss events are responsible for 50% of total economic and insured losses from 
  weather-related events globally (Munich Re, 2000). If such events are closely 
  spaced, they also can generate insolvencies or deplete surplus (Swiss Re, 1997; 
  Ryland, 2000). Hybrid events involving multiple sources of insurance losses 
  are of particular concern (White and Etkin, 1997; Francis and Hengeveld, 1998). 
  This concern is exemplified in the case of ENSO events. A series of small events 
  could be worse for insurers, in fact, than a single large event because individual 
  losses per event often are capped (Stipp, 1997). Very little has been published 
  on this subject since the mid-1980s (AIRAC, 1986).</p>
