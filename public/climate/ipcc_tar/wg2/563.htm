<p><a name="tab154"></a>Drought may increase in the southern Prairies, and production 
  areas may shift northward in Canada. In assessing the potential for expansion 
  to areas in northern Canada (i.e., north of 55&deg;N and west of 110&deg;W) 
  and Alaska, Mills (1994) identified 57 Mha of potentially arable land (class 
  1-5, based on Canada Land Inventory criteria) with agricultural potential for 
  use in either annual cropping or perennial forage systems. This estimate drops 
  to 39 Mha when climatic limitations are imposed but under a scenario of doubled 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, increases to 55 Mha with an accompanying improvement 
  of land class to class 3. Similar outcomes&#151;expansion of agricultural land, 
  especially expansion of the zone suitable for corn and soybean production&#151;are 
  expected for northern areas of eastern Canada (Brklacich <i>et al</i>., 1997a). Other 
  case studies conducted in the southern portion of the Mackenzie basin in northwestern 
  Canada show that two different climate-change scenarios would relax the constraints 
  imposed by a short and cool frost-free season but that drier conditions and 
  accelerated crop development would offset the potential gains of a warmer climate 
  (Brklacich <i>et al</i>., 1996, 1997b).</p>
<p>Southern regions growing heat-tolerant crops such as citrus fruit and cotton 
  might benefit from reduced incidence of killing frosts resulting from a change 
  in climate (Miller and Downton, 1993; Mearns <i>et al</i>., 2000). Results of simulations 
  without CO<sub>2</sub>-induced yield improvement indicate that production of 
  citrus fruit would shift northward in the southern United States, but yields 
  may decline in southern Florida and Texas because of excessive heat during the 
  winter (Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 1996).<br>
  <br>
  Mexican agriculture appears to be particularly vulnerable to climate-induced 
  changes in precipitation because most (about 85%) of its agricultural land is 
  classified as arid or semi-arid. Recent national assessments of the impacts 
  of climate change indicate that the northern and central regions of Mexico are 
  most vulnerable in the agricultural sector (Conde, 1999) and that in these regions, 
  the area of land that is unsuitable for rainfed maize production would expand 
  under climate change (Conde <i>et al</i>., 1997). On average, more than 90% 
  of losses in Mexican agriculture are caused by drought (Appendini and Liverman, 
  1995). Using five GCM-based scenarios, it was estimated that potential evaporation 
  may increase by 7-16% and the annual soil moisture deficit could increase by 
  18-45% in important maize-growing regions in eastern Mexico (Liverman and O'Brien, 
  1991). Rising levels of CO<sub>2</sub> can have the greatest relative beneficial 
  impacts when water is limited. Therefore, rising CO<sub>2</sub> may be expected 
  to have a significant positive impact because so much of Mexican crops are water-limited 
  and rising CO<sub>2</sub> enhances water-use efficiency (see <a href="516.htm">Chapter 
  14</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="152312"></a>15.2.3.1.2. Crop yields and adaptation</h4>
<p>Depending on existing conditions, global warming and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment 
  can have positive or negative effects on crop yields. It is believed that yield 
  increases in mid- and high latitudes are caused by positive physiological effects 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>, longer growing season, and amelioration of the effects of 
  cold temperature on growth. Decreases in yield could result from shortening 
  of the growing period, reduced water availability, and/or poor vernalization.</p>
<p>Estimates of the impacts of climate change on crops across North America vary 
  widely (see <a href="562.htm#tab153">Table 15-3</a>). In some studies, the impacts 
  range from nearly total crop failure for wheat and soybeans at one U.S. site 
  to wheat yield increases of 180-230% for other sites in the United States and 
  Canada (Brklacich <i>et al</i>., 1994; Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 1994). Recent 
  modeling efforts indicate that the impacts on yields for many crops grown under 
  dryland conditions, even without adaptation, is positive (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 
  2000). Threshold limits associated with temperature increases may be important. 
  Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>. (1995) report generally positive crop yield responses 
  to temperature increases of 2&deg;C, but yield reductions occurred at increases 
  of more than 4&deg;C. Modeled yield results that include the direct physiological 
  effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are substantially different from those that do not 
  account for such effects (Fischer <i>et al</i>., 1996).<br>
  <br>
  Although it is known that the distribution and proliferation of weeds, crop 
  diseases, and insects are determined to a large extent by climate, most crop 
  modeling efforts have not thoroughly accounted for potential impacts of climate 
  change and variability on pest populations and ranges. Interactions between 
  crops and pests under changing climate conditions will be very complex and are 
  difficult to predict because elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, warmer temperatures, and 
  increased climate variability would alter the relationships between crops, weeds, 
  and insects significantly. Higher temperatures and warmer winters could reduce 
  winterkill of insects as well as broaden the range of other temperature-sensitive 
  pathogens (Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 2000). Increases in the incidence of extreme weather 
  events could reduce the efficacy of pesticide applications and result in more 
  injury to nontarget organisms (Patterson <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
  <br>
  Modeling studies of changes in crop production show strong regional effects, 
  with some areas suffering significant losses compared to other regions&#151;suggesting 
  that climate change may affect the comparative advantage of agricultural production 
  regions within North America. For example, in scenarios investigated for the 
  U.S. National Assessment (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 2000), the lake states, mountain states, 
  and Pacific region showed gains in production, whereas the southeast, delta, 
  southern Plains, and Appalachia generally lost. The economic impact of these 
  changes in crop production as a result of climate change is considered to be 
  mostly beneficial to society as a whole. The effects are largely detrimental 
  to producers because the overall positive effect on production leads to decreasing 
  prices. Thus, climate change is beneficial for foreign trade surplus and for 
  consumers. Analyses of the economic effects of various climate change scenarios 
  on the welfare of consumers and producers in the United States show that agricultural 
  welfare strictly increases with 1.5 &deg;C warming, but further warming reduces 
  the benefit at an increasing rate (Mendelsohn <i>et al</i>., 1999). Additional precipitation 
  is strictly beneficial (Adams <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>The costs and benefits of climate change must be evaluated concurrently with 
  behavioral, economic, and institutional adjustments brought about by climate 
  change. These adjustments occur at different levels. For example, farm-level 
  adaptations can be made in plant and harvest dates, crop rotations, selections 
  of crops and crop varieties for cultivation, water consumption for irrigation, 
  use of fertilizers, and tillage practices. At the market level, prices are a 
  strong signal to adapt as farmers make decisions about land use and which crops 
  to grow. <br>
</p>
<p>Current economic studies of climate change that include farm- and/or market-level 
  adjustments suggest that the negative effects of climate change on agriculture 
  probably have been overestimated by studies that do not account for adjustments 
  that will be made. This may be caused by the ability of the agricultural production 
  community to respond with great flexibility to a gradually changing climate. 
  Typically, extreme weather poses a significant challenge to individual farming 
  operations that may lack the spatial diversity and financial resources of large, 
  integrated, corporate enterprises with production capabilities in one or more 
  areas.<br>
</p>
<p>Simulation modeling using four GCM-based scenarios showed that U.S. cereal 
  production decreases by 21-38% when farmers continue to do what they are 
  now doing (i.e., no adaptation) (see <a href="#tab154">Table 15-4</a>). When 
  scenarios that involve adaptation by farmers are used, decreases in cereal production 
  are not as large and the adaptations are shown to offset the initial climate-induced 
  reduction by 35-60% (Schimmelpfennig <i>et al</i>., 1996; Segerson and 
  Dixon, 1999).</p>
