<h3>12.5.3. Cropping and Horticulture </h3>
<p>Cropping in Australia recently has undergone great diversification, from predominantly 
  wheat and barley to include a variety of other crops, including rice, cotton, 
  pulses, and oilseeds. Cane sugar is grown extensively in coastal areas of Queensland. 
  Many of these crops are subject to frost limitations on seasons and to water 
  stress in dry spells; some are subject to direct heat stress or deterioration 
  during heat waves. For example, wheat grain protein composition deteriorates 
  after several days above 35&deg;C (Burke <i>et al.</i>, 1988; Behl <i>et al.</i>, 
  1993), making it less suitable for high-value uses such as pasta and breadmaking. 
  However, climate warming may allow earlier planting and faster phenological 
  development, resulting in little change in heat shock risk up to a 4&deg;C mean 
  warming (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1999c). Independently, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  can result in a decrease in wheat grain protein content&#151;also leading to 
  a decrease in breadmaking quality (Rogers <i>et al.</i>, 1998). A potential 
  complication of these impacts is water stress that results in decreased yield 
  and potentially increased protein.</p>

<p><a name="fig12-3"></a>Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999c) report a comprehensive study 
  of global change impacts on Australian wheat cropping. Studies were conducted 
  of changes in wheat yields, grain quality, and gross economic margins across 
  10 sites in the present Australian wheat belt. Results were scaled up to provide 
  national estimates, with and without varying planting dates. Response surfaces 
  were constructed across the full range of uncertainty in the CSIRO (1996a) scenarios 
  and are shown in bar-graph form in <a href="#fig12-3">Figure 12-3</a>. The estimated 
  increase in yield resulting from physiological effects of a doubling of actual 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is about 24%. The analysis assumes that the regional 
  distribution of cropping is unaffected. (This is not completely accurate, but 
  changes at the margins of present areas would not change the total yield much.) 
  The best variety of wheat is used under each scenario, with current planting 
  dates (a) and optimal planting dates (b) for each scenario. Note that yield 
  reaches a maximum at about 1&deg;C warming with current planting dates but about 
  2&deg;C with optimal planting dates and that yield drops rapidly with decreases 
  in rainfall. Under the SRES scenarios, warming in Australian wheat-growing areas 
  would exceed 2&deg;C and could be well in excess of 6&deg;C by 2100; actual 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations could be between 540 and 970 ppm.</p>
<p>Doubling CO<sub>2</sub> alone produced national yield increases of 24% in currently 
  cropped areas, but with a decline in grain nitrogen content of 9-15%, which 
  would require increases in the use of nitrogen-based fertilizer of 40-220 kg 
  ha<sup>-1</sup> or increased rotations of nitrogen-fixing plants. Using the 
  mid-range values from the CSIRO (1996a) scenario (which includes both slab-ocean 
  and coupled GCMs and is now superseded&#151;see below), climate change added 
  to CO<sub>2</sub> increase led to national yield increases of 20% by 2100 under 
  present planting practices or 26% with optimum planting dates (Howden <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1999c). Regional changes varied widely.</p>
<p>Howden's response surfaces show that for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> but no 
  change from historical rainfall, a 1&deg;C increase in temperature would slightly 
  increase national yield (see <a href="#fig12-3">Figure 12-3a</a>) when the best 
  variety was used with the current planting window. However, the slope of the 
  temperature curve turned negative beyond 1&deg;C, so the yield at 2&deg;C was 
  predicted to be similar to that at present temperatures, and the total yield 
  declined below the current value for greater warmings. Adoption of earlier planting 
  windows with climate change extended the yield plateau to 2&deg;C warming before 
  the slope of the temperature curve became negative (see <a href="#fig12-3">Figure 
  12-3b</a>). This was based on the present regional distribution of cropping, 
  although cropping could expand into drier marginal areas with higher CO<sub>2</sub>&#151;but 
  this may be countered by substantial reductions in rainfall or land degradation 
  in currently cropped areas. Yield decreases rapidly with decreases in rainfall.</p>
<p>These response surfaces were used by Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) with the 
  SRES scenarios (see <a href="468.htm#12154">Section 12.1.5.4</a>), which use 
  only recent coupled-ocean GCMs that show reductions in rainfall over most of 
  mainland Australia in summer and winter. Results indicate that for mid-range 
  scenarios (A1-mid and B2-mid) extended to 2100, national yields are reduced 
  3% without adaptation compared with current yields and increase only 3% with 
  adaptation. Yields decline in western Australia and south Australia but increase 
  in the eastern states. With the A2-high scenario, there are much larger negative 
  impacts, with cropping becoming nonviable over entire regions, especially in 
  western Australia. These results highlight the importance of the more negative 
  rainfall scenarios found with the coupled-ocean GCMs.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, generally drier conditions and reductions in groundwater will 
  have substantial impacts on cereal production in Canterbury (east coast South 
  Island), the major wheat and barley production area of New Zealand. Other grain-producing 
  areas (primarily Manawatu and Southland) are less likely to be affected. Grain 
  phenological responses to warming and increased CO<sub>2</sub> are mostly positive, 
  making grain filling slightly earlier and decreasing drought risk (Pyke <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1998; Jamieson and Munro, 1999). Although grain-filling duration may 
  be decreased by warmer temperatures, earlier flowering may compensate by shifting 
  grain filling into an earlier, cooler period.</p>
<p>Maize production is mainly in Waikato (upper middle North Island) and Bay of 
  Plenty and Poverty Bay (east coast North Island), with some production (more 
  likely to be for silage than grain) further south in Manawatu and Canterbury. 
  Rising temperatures make this crop less risky in the south, but water availability 
  may become an issue in Canterbury.</p>
<p>Sweetcorn is grown mostly on the east coast of the North Island (Poverty Bay 
  and Hawke's Bay) but increasingly in Canterbury. Climate warming is decreasing 
  frost risk for late-sown crops, extending the season and moving the southern 
  production margin further south. In the South Island, production is irrigated 
  and is vulnerable to changes in river flows and underground water supply.</p>
<p>Horticulture in Australia includes cool,temperate fruit and vegetables in the 
  south and at higher elevations, extensive areas of tropical fruits in the northeast 
  and in irrigated areas in the northwest, and a rapidly expanding viticulture 
  industry in cool and warm temperate zones. Many temperate fruits require winter 
  chill or vernalization&#151;which in some cases can be replaced by chemical 
  treatments&#151;and are strongly affected by disease and hail. Other more tropical 
  fruit are subject to disease outbreaks and severe damage from hail, high winds, 
  and heavy rain from tropical storms. These fruits are all likely to be affected 
  by climate change, but few studies have been made (but see Hennessy and Clayton-Greene, 
  1995; Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>In New Zealand, climate change may have mixed results on horticulture. Kiwifruit 
  require some winter chill (Hall and McPherson, 1997a), and studies by Salinger 
  and Kenny (1995) and Hall and McPherson (1997b) suggest that some varieties 
  in some regions will become marginal; warmer summers and extended growing seasons 
  may benefit others but may adversely affect timing for overseas markets.</p>
<p>Chilling requirements for most cultivars of pip-fruit are easily satisfied. 
  However, some common cultivars have shown an adverse reaction to excessively 
  warm conditions, with problems such as sunburn, water-core, and lack of color.</p>
<p>There has been a southern expansion of grapes in New Zealand over the past 
  few decades, sometimes into more climatically marginal land. The New Zealand 
  wine industry to date has shown a largely beneficial response to warm, dry conditions, 
  which are expected to become more dominant in the east, but limitations on groundwater 
  for irrigation may become a problem. Warmer conditions also are assisting expansion 
  of the citrus industry in the north of New Zealand and are particularly beneficial 
  for mandarins. However, this region would be susceptible to any increase in 
  the location-specific frequency of subtropical storms reaching New Zealand.</p>
