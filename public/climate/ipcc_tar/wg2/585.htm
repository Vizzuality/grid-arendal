<h4><a name="15325"></a>15.3.2.5. Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Subregion </h4>
<p>Scenario-based studies in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin conducted over 
  the past 15 years (see <a href="554.htm">Section 15.2.1</a>) have indicated 
  consistently that a warmer climate would lead to reductions in water supply 
  and lake levels (Cohen, 1986; Croley, 1990; Hartmann, 1990; Mortsch and Quinn, 
  1996; Mortsch, 1998). Observed low-level events have been rare during the past 
  several decades, but when they have occurred (e.g., 1963-1965, 1988), conflicts 
  related to existing water diversions and competing stakeholders have led to 
  legal challenges and political stress (Changnon and Glantz, 1996). </p>
<p>In 1998-1999, dry and record warm weather combined to reduce ice extent 
  and lower water levels (Assel <i>et al</i>., 2000). In November 1998 and again 
  in spring 1999, cargo limits were placed on ships travelling through the Great 
  Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway when water levels fell by more than 25 cm. 
  Some commercial ships ran aground. Lower water levels significantly increased 
  the distance between docks and waters at some tourism facilities and marinas. 
  Recreational boaters had access to fewer waterways. In addition, hydroelectric 
  facilities are very dependent on water flows and have expressed concern about 
  maintaining production (Mittelstaedt, 1999). These observed impacts are similar 
  to the impact scenarios described earlier. The reduction in ice cover did provide 
  some offsetting benefits by reducing the need for icebreakers during the winter 
  and spring (Assel <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Water resources management, ecosystem and land management, and health concerns 
  are highlighted in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin Project (GLSLB) and 
  the Toronto-Niagara Region Study (TNR). The former is a binational exercise 
  that used analogs and model-based scenarios to assess impacts and adaptation 
  responses. Reduced lake levels continue to be projected, leading to potential 
  conflicts over water regulation and diversions, water quality, and rural water 
  use (Mortsch <i>et al</i>., 1998). The TNR exercise is in its initial stages. 
  Within the GLSLB region, the TNR represents a highly urbanized area that has 
  a significant impact on surrounding agricultural and forest landscapes. Urban 
  influences on land use, air quality, and human health will be a major focus. 
  In addition, concerns about vulnerabilities of the built environment (transportation 
  and energy infrastructure, etc.) have been identified as high-priority research 
  questions (Mills and Craig, 1999).</p>
<p>There also have been studies of alternative scenarios for lake-level management. 
  Decision support systems can facilitate this process (Chao <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<h4><a name="15326"></a>15.3.2.6. North Atlantic Subregion</h4>
<p>Severe winter storms combined with a loss of power can have devastating consequences, 
  even in a highly developed region such as Ontario-Quebec and the northeast United 
  States. In January 1998, a severe winter storm struck; instead of snow, some 
  areas accumulated more than 80 mm of freezing rain&#151;double the amount of 
  precipitation experienced in any prior ice storm. The result was a catastrophe 
  that produced the largest estimated insured loss in the history of Canada. The 
  same storm ran across northern New York and parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, 
  and Maine in the United States (see <a href="582.htm#tab155">Table 15-5</a>). 
  The basic electric power infrastructure, with its lengthy transmission lines, 
  was severely damaged, stranding some residents and farmers without power for 
  as many as 4 weeks. Almost 5 million people were without power at some point 
  during the storm, and consideration was given to evacuation of Montreal. In 
  Canada, there were 28 deaths, and damages were US$2-3 billion (CDN$3-4 billion) 
  (Kovacs, 1998; Kerry <i>et al</i>., 1999). The same storm caused 17 deaths in 
  the United States, as well as damages exceeding US$1 billion in New York and 
  the New England states&#151;one-third of which was from losses to electric utilities 
  and communications (DeGaetano, 2000). Combined Canadian and U.S. insured losses 
  stood in excess of US$1.2 billion as of October 1, 1998. Total Canadian insured 
  and uninsured economic losses were approximately US$4 billion (CDN$6.4 billion). 
</p>
<p>The ice storm produced more than 835,000 insurance claims from policyholders 
  in Canada and the United States. This was 20% more claims than were created 
  by Hurricane Andrew, the costliest natural disaster in the history of the United 
  States. </p>
<p>The event served as a grim learning laboratory for the insurance and disaster 
  recovery communities. It revealed the wide spectrum of insured and noninsured 
  losses that can materialize from a single natural catastrophe, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Property losses (e.g., roof damages and destruction of perishable goods 
    as a result of loss of electric power)</li>
  <li>Business interruption losses (19% of the employed Canadian workforce was 
    unable to get to work)</li>
  <li>Health/life losses (including losses incurred during recovery operations)</li>
  <li>Additional living expense costs for people relocated to temporary housing</li>
  <li>A host of agricultural losses, ranging from livestock deaths, to interrupted 
    maple syrup production, to milk production</li>
  <li>Disruption and damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure</li>
  <li>Disaster recovery costs, including personnel and overtime expenses, provision 
    of backup electric generators and fuel, debris clearing, temporary shelter 
    for displaced citizens, and disaster assistance payments to victims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ice storms occur regularly in North America, although severe and prolonged 
  damage is rare. Several urban centers are vulnerable to major storms, including 
  Minneapolis, Winnipeg, Chicago, Detroit, Toronto, Buffalo, Montreal, Boston, 
  and even New York. Many communities are not prepared for an extreme winter storm, 
  particularly combined with the loss of electric power. In the 1998 storm, total 
  losses exceeded insured losses by a substantial margin. The event also raised 
  questions about the connection between such events, the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, 
  and global climate change.</p>
