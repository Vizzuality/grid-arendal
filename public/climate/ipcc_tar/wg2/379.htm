<h2>10.1. Introduction to African Region </h2>
<h3><a name="1011"></a>10.1.1. Previous Syntheses of African Region</h3>
<p>Previous assessments (Hulme, 1996; IPCC, 1998) concluded that the African continent 
  is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of factors 
  such as widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution, 
  and overdependence on rainfed agriculture. Timely response actions were considered 
  to be beyond the economic means of some countries. Deterioration in terms of 
  trade, inappropriate policies, high population growth rates, and lack of significant 
  investment&#151;coupled with a highly variable climate&#151;have made it difficult 
  for several countries to develop patterns of livelihood that would reduce pressure 
  on the natural resource base. The reports fell short of assigning relative importance 
  to these different factors in Africa's capacity to adapt to climate change. 
  This still is not possible and presents a new challenge for future assessments.</p>
<h3><a name="1012"></a>10.1.2. What is Different about Africa?</h3>
<p>The main background factors that need to be kept in mind in assessing the vulnerability 
  of the African region to climate change&#151;particularly the capacity of African 
  governments to respond proactively to changes that are largely not of their 
  making or under their control&#151;are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Diversity:</i> The term "African region" is a geographical 
    convenience only. There is as much diversity of climate, landform, biota, 
    culture, and economic circumstance within the region as there is between it 
    and, say, South America or Asia. Very few statements are valid for the entire 
    continent. The generalities that follow must be read in that context.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Climate</i>: Africa is predominantly tropical, hot, and dry. There are 
    small regions of temperate (cool) climates in the extreme south and north 
    and at high altitudes in between. Parts of west Africa, as well as the western 
    part of central Africa, are humid throughout the year. A large region north 
    and south of this humid core is subhumid, with substantial rainfall during 
    the wet season (or seasons, in the case of east Africa) but almost no rain 
    during the extended dry season. Poleward from this zone is a large area of 
    semi-arid climates, which permit marginal cropping during the wet season but 
    are characterized by extreme unreliability of rainfall and few permanent surface-water 
    sources. Most of the human population occurs in the subhumid and semi-arid 
    zones. Corresponding to the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer are the vast desert 
    regions of the Kalahari-Namib and the Sahara.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Development Status: </i>Measured by almost any index of human well-being, 
    Africa contains the poorest and least-developed nations of the world. Per 
    capita gross domestic product (GDP), life expectancy, infant mortality, and 
    adult literacy are all in the bottom quartile globally when averaged across 
    Africa, although individual nations may perform somewhat better on one or 
    more of these indices. The general weakness of the science and technology 
    infrastructure&#151;in particular, the relatively small numbers of technically 
    trained professionals&#151;limits the rate at which adaptive research can 
    be performed or implemented.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Food Supply:</i> More than half of the African population is rural and 
    directly dependent on locally grown crops or foods harvested from the immediate 
    environment. Per capita food production in Africa has been declining over 
    the past 2 decades, contrary to the global trend. The result is widespread 
    malnutrition, a recurrent need for emergency food aid, and increasing dependence 
    on food grown outside the region.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Dependence on Natural Resources:</i> The formal and informal economies 
    of most African countries are strongly based on natural resources: Agriculture, 
    pastoralism, logging, ecotourism, and mining are dominant. Climatic variations 
    that alter the viability of these activities, for better or for worse, have 
    very high leverage on the economy.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Biodiversity:</i> About one-fifth of the world's plants, birds, 
    and mammals originate or have major areas of present conservation in Africa. 
    There are major "hot spots" of biodiversity within west, east, central, 
    and southern Africa.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Low Capacity for State-Initiated Interventions: </i>Governance structures 
    typically are underfunded and undercapacity. In many instances they have been 
    undermined by military coups, despotism, tribalism, corruption, maladministration, 
    and economic adjustment programs imposed by the international financial community. 
    Communication from capitals to the remotest provinces&#151;by road, rail, 
    air, or telephone&#151;often is unreliable and slow. State-centered political 
    economies in their postcolonial sense are relatively recent over most of Africa, 
    and their boundaries include wide ethnic diversity within single nations and 
    cut across previous political territories.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Disease Burden: </i>Insect-vector diseases such as malaria and tryanosomiasis; 
    water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and schistosomiasis; and poverty-related 
    diseases such as tuberculosis are prevalent in Africa. Water and food security 
    are closely linked with health. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing great strain 
    on the health infrastructure. Heavy mortalities lead to great loss of productive 
    potential. <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Armed Conflict:</i> There has been chronic armed conflict in several 
    regions of Africa almost continuously for the past 3 decades. This weakens 
    the ability of the nations involved to respond to climate change and adds 
    large refugee populations to the local population, which must be supported 
    by the environment.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>High External Trade and Aid Dependence:</i> Very little industrial beneficiation 
    takes place in Africa. High volumes of relatively low-value goods dominate 
    export economies. In general, there is no strong internal demand (national 
    or regional) to buffer the economies from changes in global trade. Trade linkages 
    show the pattern established by the former colonial relationships. Many African 
    countries have a negative trade balance, particularly as a result of heavy 
    international debt-servicing burdens, and are chronically dependent on financial 
    aid from the developed world.</li>
