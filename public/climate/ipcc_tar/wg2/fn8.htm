  economic losses are dominated by direct damages (insured and uninsured)&#151;defined 
  as damage to fixed assets (including property or crops), capital, and inventories 
  of finished and semi-finished goods or raw materials and finished products&#151;that 
  occur simultaneously or as a direct consequence of the natural phenomenon causing 
  a disaster. Economic loss data also can include indirect or other secondary 
  damages such as business interruptions, personal loss (e.g., injuries and death), 
  or temporary relocation expenses for displaced households and businesses, as 
  well as the effect on flow of goods that will not be produced and services that 
  will not be provided. More loosely related damages such as impacts on national 
  gross domestic product (GDP) are not included. Insured losses are a subset of 
  economic losses. The data presented here are based on a diversity of sources 
  compiled by the Geosciences Group at Munich Re for the period 1950-1999, 
  and are unadjusted for purchasing power parity. The particular costs included 
  can vary somewhat among countries and over time. In some cases, country definitions 
  of losses set minimum thresholds for inclusion; thus, the totals presented here 
  are underestimates of actual losses. For example, because of the minimum cost 
  threshold of US$5 million until 1996 and US$25 million thereafter in the United 
  States, no winter storms were included in the statistics for the 46-year period 
  1949-1974, and few were included thereafter (Kunkel <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  Although large in aggregate, highly diffuse losses resulting from structural 
  damages from land subsidence (e.g., approaching as much as US$1 billion yr-<sup>1</sup> 
  during periods of low rainfall in the UK; see Figure 8-3) also would rarely 
  be captured in these statistics.</span></p>
