<h2><a name="46"></a>4.6. Adaptation Options and Management Implications</h2>
<h3><a name="461"></a>4.6.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>The preceding sections have assessed the possible effects of climate change 
  on the water resource base and on the demand for water, as well as the potential 
  impacts on water users. Most published studies have looked at impacts in the 
  absence of planned adaptation to climate change, and the few studies that have 
  tried to cost impacts have had to make assumptions about adaptation. This section 
  assesses opportunities in the water sector for adapting to climate change and 
  explores any constraints which may exist.</p>
<p>Water management has always adapted to change (especially following extreme 
  events or in response to increased demand), and climate change is just one of 
  the pressures facing water managers. Other pressures include increasing demands 
  for water resources or protection against hazard, changing water management 
  objectives (which recently have included increasing recognition of the importance 
  of meeting environmental needs as well as those of offstream demands), changing 
  water management technologies, and altered legislative environments.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between development of adaptive options for 
  meeting changing demands and resources and assessment of the abilities of a 
  given water management agency (interpreted broadly) actually to adapt to climate 
  change. Over the years, a wide range of adaptive techniques has been developed, 
  largely in response to the need to meet increased demands. Broad distinctions 
  can be drawn among &#147;supply-side&#148; adaptive techniques (changing structures, 
  operating rules, and institutional arrangements) and &#147;demand-side&#148; 
  techniques (which change the demand for water or protection against risk and 
  include institutional changes as well). Examples of supply-side adaptations 
  include increasing flood defenses, building weirs and locks to manage water 
  levels for navigation, and modifying or extending infrastructure to collect 
  and distribute water to consumers. Demand-side techniques include water demand 
  management (such as encouraging water-efficient irrigation and water pricing 
  initiatives), changing water allocations (Miller et al., 1997), and nonstructural 
  flood management measures (such as land-use controls). Distinctions also can 
  be drawn between anticipatory and reactive actions. The former are taken in 
  advance of some change, the latter in response to a change. Reactive actions 
  include short-term operational adaptations, such as temporary exploitation of 
  new sources, and longer term measures. A major flood or drought, for example, 
  often triggers a change in water management. However, although many adaptive 
  options do exist, knowledge of these options and the expertise of officials 
  to execute them may be limited in some situations.</p>
<p>The optimum extent of adaptation can be characterized in terms of the benefits 
  and costs of adaptation. The extremes of adaptation are &#147;no adaptation&#148; 
  and &#147;adaptation sufficient to eliminate all effects&#148; (which usually 
  is not physically possible). The optimum level of adaptation minimizes the combined 
  costs of adaptation and residual negative effects, with the most cost-effective 
  steps taken first. </p>
<p>Water managers long have had access to many techniques for assessing options 
  and implementing adaptive strategies. However, the techniques used have changed 
  over time and vary between countries, and they are very much influenced by institutional 
  arrangements in place in a country. Factors that affect adaptive capacity in 
  a country include institutional capacity, wealth, management philosophy (particularly 
  management attitudes toward supply-side versus demand-side strategies, as well 
  as &#147;sustainable&#148; management), planning time scale, and organizational 
  arrangements (adaptation will be harder, for example, when there are many different 
  &#147;managers&#148; involved or where water managers do not have sound professional 
  guidance).</p>
<p>This section looks first at water management options, then at management techniques. 
  It contends that water managers generally are aware of technical and institutional 
  options&#151;although for many reasons may not have access to all of them&#151;and 
  that climate change challenges management techniques for assessing and selecting 
  options, rather than the technical and institutional options themselves.</p>
