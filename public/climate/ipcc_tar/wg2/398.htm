<h4>10.2.4.9. Vulnerability</h4>
<p>Evidence is emerging that many ecosystems on the African continent carry risks 
  of climate-driven threats to human health. Predisposing factors include geographic 
  location, socioeconomic status, and knowledge and attitude toward preventive 
  measures. For example, populations living above 1,500 m in the east African 
  highlands are at risk of epidemic malaria (Lindsay and Martens, 1998); those 
  living along the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Great Lakes are at a risk 
  of cholera infections when conditions for transmission are suitable (Birmingham 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1997; Shapiro <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Sahel and other arid areas where there are humidity deficits, 
  populations are exposed to meningoccocal meningitis (Tikhomirov <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997) and, in flood-prone pastoral areas, RVF (Linthicum <i>et al.</i>, 1990). 
  Vulnerability also can be increased by close habitation with animals that are 
  reservoirs of zoonotic diseases such RVF and plague. </p>
<p>The socioeconomic status of communities may determine whether safe drinking 
  water (piped water, rain-harvested water, and protected wells) is available 
  (Sabwa and Githeko, 1985). The quality of housing is important because simple 
  measures such as screening windows and doors will prevent the entry of disease 
  vectors into human dwellings. </p>
<p>Human factors such as knowledge and attitude and practice will influence health 
  care-seeking behavior of an individual (Karanja <i>et al., </i>1999). For example, 
  individuals may choose to visit a local healer instead of a clinical facility, 
  and this could affect the progression and outcome of an infection. </p>
<p>At the institutional level, the fragile infrastructure is unable to cope with 
  the impacts of diseases. For example, flood areas often are inaccessible, and 
  delivery of medical intervention is hampered considerably. Furthermore, pathogens 
  such as those of malaria and cholera are resistant to commonly used medication. 
  In the case of malaria, more than 60% of cases are treated at home (Reubush 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1995) with drugs that may not be effective (Karanja <i>et al.,</i> 
  1999), particularly in nonimmune populations. Misdiagnoses of fevers, especially 
  during epidemics of uncommon and unfamiliar diseases, leads to delayed treatment 
  and consequently high morbidity and mortality (CDC, 1998). In many cases, foreign 
  assistance is required, and this assistance may come too late. These factors 
  increase the vulnerability of affected populations.</p>
<h4>10.2.4.10. Adaptation<a name="102410"></a></h4>
<p>Understanding how climate affects the transmission of these diseases will lead 
  to enhanced preparedness for early and effective interventions. Monitoring drug 
  sensitivity to commonly used anti-malaria drugs and antibiotics will prevent 
  the use of ineffective interventions. Communities that are exposed to water-borne 
  diseases such as cholera could reduce the risk of infections by using safe drinking 
  water technologies.</p>
<p>Several large-scale studies in Africa have demonstrated that insecticide-treated 
  fabrics (e.g., bed-nets and curtains) can significantly reduce the risk of malaria 
  infections (Lengeler, 1998). However, such interventions are not effective against 
  day-biting mosquitoes that are vectors of RVF. </p>
<p>Remote sensing is increasingly becoming an important tool in forecasting the 
  risks of transmission in malaria, RVF, and cholera. Hay <i>et al.</i> (1998) 
  have shown that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) correlated 
  significantly with malaria presentation, with a lag period of 1 month. NDVI 
  is a function of climatic factors that are similar to those that affect malaria 
  transmission. Ability to use remote sensing to accurately detect parameters 
  such as ground moisture that determine flooding could provide local officials 
  with sufficient warning to allow for implementation of specific mosquito control 
  measures before a disease (RVF) outbreak (Linthicum <i>et al.,</i> 1990, 1999). 
  In the case of cholera, it is now possible to utilize remote sensing and computer 
  processing to integrate ecological, epidemiological, and remotely sensed spatial 
  data for the purpose of developing predictive models of cholera outbreaks (Colwell, 
  1996).</p>
<h4>10.2.4.11. Technology for Safe Drinking Water<a name="102411"></a></h4>
<p>Flooding, which can be exacerbated by climate change, often results in increased 
  contamination of drinking water. In other instances, drought and an increase 
  in surface water temperatures have been associated with transmission of cholera. 
  Although Cryptosporidium parvum is the more important water-borne pathogen in 
  developed countries, Vibrio cholerae is more pervasive in developing countries. 
  Giardia lumbria, a water-borne protozoa, has a universal distribution. These 
  pathogens pose serious threat to individuals whose immune systems are compromised; 
  furthermore, there are numerous records of resistance to antibiotics by cholera 
  bacteria (e.g., Weber <i>et al., </i>1994). Therefore, it is essential that 
  populations that are vulnerable to water-borne diseases should enhance safe 
  drinking water technology. </p>
<p>Cryptosporidium parva oocytes are very resistant to chlorine and other drinking-water 
  disinfectants (Venczel <i>et al., </i>1997). In addition, the cysts have a very 
  low sedimentation rate (Medema <i>et al.,</i> 1998); consequently, boiling may 
  be the most appropriate method of disinfecting water where risks of infection 
  exist (Willocks <i>et al.,</i> 1998). However, the use of submicron point-of-use 
  water filters may reduce the risk of water-borne cryptosporidiasis (Addis <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1996).</p>
<p>Several simple and inexpensive techniques have been found to be effective in 
  reducing the risk of infection with cholera from contaminated water. Huo <i>et 
  al</i>. (1996) found that a simple filtration procedure involving the use of 
  domestic sari material can reduce the number of cholera vibrio attached to plankton 
  in raw water from ponds and rivers commonly used for drinking water. In Bolivia, 
  the use of 5% calcium hypochlorite to disinfect water and subsequent storage 
  of treated water in a narrow-mouthed jar produced drinking water from nonpotable 
  sources that met WHO standards for microbiologic quality (Quick <i>et al., </i>1996). 
  In many cases, boiling water is not possible because of scarcity of firewood 
  and charcoal, particularly in flooded conditions. These examples of low-cost 
  technologies should become widely available to populations that are likely to 
  be impacted by contaminated water supplies, especially following extreme flooding 
  events.</p>
