<h2>18.8. Conclusions</h2>
<p><i>Adaptation can significantly reduce adverse impacts of climate change.</i> 
  Adaptation is an important part of societal response to global climate change. 
  Planned, anticipatory adaptation has the potential to reduce vulnerability and 
  realize opportunities associated with climate change effects and hazards. There 
  are numerous examples of successful adaptations that would apply to climate 
  change risks and opportunities. Substantial reductions in climate change damages 
  can be achieved, especially in the most vulnerable regions, through timely deployment 
  of adaptation measures.</p>
<p><i>In the absence of planned adaptation, communities will adapt autonomously 
  to changing climatic conditions, but not without costs and residual damages.</i> 
  Societies and economies have been making adaptations to climate for centuries. 
  However, losses from climate-related extreme events are substantial and, in 
  some sectors, increasing&#151;indicating patterns of development that remain 
  vulnerable to temporal variations in climatic conditions and to climate change. 
  The ecological, social, and economic costs of relying on reactive, autonomous 
  adaptation to the cumulative effects of climate change are substantial and largely 
  avoidable through planned, anticipatory adaptation.</p>
<p><i>The key features of climate change for vulnerability and adaptation are 
  those that relate to variability and extremes, not simply changed average conditions.</i> 
  In addition, the speed of changes in event frequency is important. Most communities, 
  sectors, and regions are reasonably adaptable to changes in average conditions, 
  unless those changes are particularly sudden or not smooth. However, these communities 
  are more vulnerable and less adaptable to changes in the frequency and/or magnitude 
  of conditions other than average, especially extremes. Changes in the frequency 
  and magnitude of extremes underlie changes in mean conditions and thus are inherent 
  in climate change; adaptation initiatives to these hazards are of particular 
  need.</p>
<p><i>Implementation of adaptation policies, programs, and measures usually will 
  have immediate as well as future benefits.</i> Adaptations to current climate 
  and climate-related risks (recurring droughts, storms, floods, and other extremes) 
  generally are consistent with adaptation to changing and changed climatic conditions.</p>
<p><i>Adaptations to changing climatic conditions are more likely to be implemented 
  if they are consistent with or integrated with decisions or programs that address 
  nonclimatic stresses.</i> Vulnerabilities associated with climate change rarely 
  are experienced independent of nonclimatic conditions. Impacts of climatic stimuli 
  are felt via economic or social stresses, and adaptations to climate (by individuals, 
  communities, and governments) are evaluated and undertaken in light of these 
  conditions. The costs of adaptation often are marginal to other management or 
  development costs. To be effective, climate change adaptation must consider 
  nonclimatic stresses and be consistent with existing policy criteria, development 
  objectives, and management structures.</p>
<p><i>Adaptive capacity varies considerably among regions, countries, and socioeconomic 
  groups.</i> The ability to adapt and cope with climate change impacts is a function 
  of wealth, technology, information, skills, infrastructure, institutions, and 
  equity. Groups and regions with limited adaptive capacity are more vulnerable 
  to climate change damages.</p>
<p><i>Development decisions, activities, and programs play important roles in 
  modifying the adaptive capacity of communities and regions, yet they tend not 
  to take into account risks associated with climate variability and change.</i> 
  This omission in the design and implementation of many recent and current development 
  initiatives results in unnecessary additional losses to life, well-being, and 
  investments in the short and longer terms.</p>
<p><i>Enhancement of adaptive capacity is necessary to reduce vulnerability, particularly 
  for the most vulnerable regions, nations, and socioeconomic groups.</i> Activities 
  required for the enhancement of adaptive capacity are essentially equivalent 
  to those that promote sustainable development and equity.</p>
<p><i>Current knowledge about adaptation and adaptive capacity is insufficient 
  for reliable prediction of adaptations and for rigorous evaluation of planned 
  adaptation options, measures, and policies of governments:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Although climate change vulnerability studies now usually consider adaptation, 
    they rarely go beyond identifying adaptation options that might be possible. 
    There is little research on the dynamics of adaptation in human systems, the 
    processes of adaptation decisionmaking, the conditions that stimulate or constrain 
    adaptation, and the role of nonclimatic factors.</li>
  <li>There are serious limitations in existing evaluations of adaptation options. 
    Economic benefits and costs are key criteria, but they are not sufficient 
    to adequately determine the appropriateness of adaptation measures. There 
    also has been little research to date on the roles and responsibilities of 
    individuals, communities, corporations, private and public institutions, governments, 
    and international organizations in adaptation.</li>
  <li>Given the scope and variety of specific adaptation options across sectors, 
    individuals, communities, and locations and the variety of participants&#151;private 
    and public&#151;involved in most adaptation initiatives, it is probably infeasible 
    to systematically evaluate lists of particular adaptation measures. Improving 
    and applying knowledge on the constraints and opportunities for enhancing 
    adaptive capacity is necessary to reduce vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
