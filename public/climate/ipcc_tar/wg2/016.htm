<h2>3.6. Human Settlements, Energy, and Industry</h2>
<p>A growing and increasingly quantitative literature shows that human settlements 
  are affected by climate change in one of three major ways: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The economic sectors that support the settlement are affected because of 
    changes in resource productivity or changes in market demand for the goods 
    and services produced there. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>] <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some aspects of physical infrastructure (including energy transmission and 
    distribution systems), buildings, urban services (including transportation 
    systems), and specific industries (such as agroindustry, tourism, and construction) 
    may be directly affected. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Populations may be directly affected through extreme weather, changes in 
    health status, or migration. The problems are somewhat different in the largest 
    (&lt;1 million) and mid- to small-sized population centers. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>]<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The most widespread direct risk to human settlements from climate change is 
  flooding and landslides, driven by projected increases in rainfall intensity 
  and, in coastal areas, sea-level rise. Riverine and coastal settlements are 
  particularly at risk (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>), 
  but urban flooding could be a problem anywhere that storm drains, water supply, 
  and waste management systems have inadequate capacity. In such areas, squatter 
  and other informal urban settlements with high population density, poor shelter, 
  little or no access to resources such as safe water and public health services, 
  and low adaptive capacity are highly vulnerable. Human settlements currently 
  experience other significant environmental problems which could be exacerbated 
  under higher temperature/increased precipitation regimes, including water and 
  energy resources and infrastructure, waste treatment, and transportation [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rapid urbanization in low-lying coastal areas of both the developing and developed 
  world is greatly increasing population densities and the value of human-made 
  assets exposed to coastal climatic extremes such as tropical cyclones. Model-based 
  projections of the mean annual number of people who would be flooded by coastal 
  storm surges increase several fold (by 75 to 200 million people depending on 
  adaptive responses) for mid-range scenarios of a 40-cm sea-level rise by the 
  2080s relative to scenarios with no sea-level rise. Potential damages to infrastructure 
  in coastal areas from sea-level rise have been projected to be tens of billions 
  US$ for individual countries&#151;for example, Egypt, Poland, and Vietnam. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>]</p>
<p>Settlements with little economic diversification and where a high percentage 
  of incomes derive from climate-sensitive primary resource industries (agriculture, 
  forestry, and fisheries) are more vulnerable than more diversified settlements 
  (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  In developed areas of the Arctic, and where the permafrost is ice-rich, special 
  attention will be required to mitigate the detrimental impacts of thawing, such 
  as severe damage to buildings and transport infrastructure (very high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  Industrial, transportation, and commercial infrastructure is generally vulnerable 
  to the same hazards as settlement infrastructure. Energy demand is expected 
  to increase for space cooling and decrease for space heating, but the net effect 
  is scenario- and location-dependent. Some energy production and distribution 
  systems may experience adverse impacts that would reduce supplies or system 
  reliability while other energy systems may benefit. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a> 
  and <a href="047.htm">5.7</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Possible adaptation options involve the planning of settlements and their infrastructure, 
  placement of industrial facilities, and making similar long-lived decisions 
  in a manner to reduce the adverse effects of events that are of low (but increasing) 
  probability and high (and perhaps rising) consequences. [<a href="035.htm">4.5</a>]
