<h3>12.7.2. Vulnerability </h3>
<p>Climate impacts are determined not just by the magnitude of environmental change 
  but also by the vulnerability of exposed populations. Examples of biophysical 
  vulnerability are the susceptibility of pale-skinned populations to the effects 
  of UV radiation and the vulnerability of isolated island ecosystems such as 
  New Zealand's to invasion by exotic species (including disease vectors). 
  Another example is infections spread to humans from animals, such as cryptosporidiosis. 
  New Zealand has relatively high rates of notified cases of this infection (Russell 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). This may be related to the conjunction of high densities 
  of livestock and unprotected human drinking water supplies. In such a setting, 
  increased rainfall intensity would promote transmission of the pathogen (by 
  washing animal excreta containing the organism into the water supply). </p>
<p>Woodward <i>et al.</i> (1998) reviewed social determinants of vulnerability 
  to health effects of climate change in the Pacific region. Australia and New 
  Zealand are two of the wealthiest countries in the region, with relatively low 
  population densities and well-developed social services. For these reasons, 
  Australia and New Zealand are likely to be less vulnerable overall to many of 
  the threats to health from climate change than neighboring countries. However, 
  within both countries there are groups that are particularly susceptible to 
  poor health. Sources of disadvantage include poverty, low housing standards, 
  high-risk water supplies, lack of accessible health care, and lack of mobility. 
  These factors tend to be concentrated in particular geographical locations and 
  ethnic groups (Crampton and Davis, 1998) and carry with them increased vulnerability 
  to most of the hazards that are associated with climate variability and climate 
  change. </p>
<p>There have been no studies in New Zealand or Australia that have attempted 
  to quantify vulnerability to disease and injury. Some work has been carried 
  out on indices of environmental vulnerability (e.g., Kaly <i>et al.</i>, 1999). 
  These studies have focused on measures of the resilience and integrity of ecosystems; 
  with further development, they may assist in future forecasts of the impacts 
  of climate change on human health.</p>

<h3>12.7.3. Complexities of Forecasting Health Effects</h3>
<p>There is no opportunity to study directly, in a conventional controlled fashion, 
  the effects on health of climate change. Research to date in Australia and New 
  Zealand has concentrated on the association of climate variability, at relatively 
  restricted spatial and temporal scales, with the incidence of disease. It is 
  not simple to extrapolate from these findings to long-term climate change. This 
  problem is not particular to Australia and New Zealand, but there are informative 
  local examples in the literature. These include analyses of roles of climate-related 
  variables other than temperature (e.g., the critical effects of wind on air 
  pollution, rainfall density on mosquito breeding, and humidity on heat stress); 
  interactions with local ecosystems (e.g., the potential for amplification of 
  certain arboviruses in New Zealand wildlife); and human behaviors that influence 
  exposures (such as changing patterns of skin protection and the implications 
  for UV exposures) (Hill <i>et al.</i> 1993; Russell, 1998b).</p>

<h3>12.7.4. Public Health Infrastructure</h3>
<p>A major challenge in Australia and New Zealand is how to protect and improve 
  public health systems that deal with threats to health such as those that will 
  potentially accompany climate change. Examples include border controls to prevent 
  introduction of pathogens (including those from livestock and animal imports), 
  measures required to ensure safe food and clean water, and primary health care 
  services that reach the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of the community. 
  Threats to these systems include restrictions on government spending, increasing 
  demands, and fragmented systems of purchase and provision of services. </p>
<p>With vector-borne diseases, the major challenge in Australia will be to control 
  the expansion and spread of diseases that already are present in the country, 
  such as Ross River virus and Murray Valley encephalitis&#151;which are strongly 
  influenced by climatic events. Introduction of new pathogens from close neighbors 
  such as Papua New Guinea also is possible. Imported Japanese encephalitis and 
  malaria remain serious threats, influenced principally by the numbers of people 
  moving across the Torres Strait and the effectiveness of health services in 
  the far north of Australia.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the key issue for the health sector is how to prevent the introduction 
  of vector-borne disease, particularly arboviruses carried by mosquitoes. Competent 
  vectors for conditions such as Ross River virus and dengue have been detected 
  frequently at entry points in recent years. This is likely to be a result of 
  increasing trade and passenger traffic between New Zealand and other countries, 
  as well as heightened awareness and better reporting. Eradication programs are 
  expensive, and they are feasible only when the spread of exotic mosquitoes is 
  confined. With repeated incursions and/or dispersion, the emphasis is likely 
  to shift to control strategies.</p>
