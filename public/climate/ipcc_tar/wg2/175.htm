<p><a name="fig42"></a>Patterns of river channel erosion and sedimentation are 
  determined largely by variations in streamflow over time&#151;in particular, 
  the frequency of floods. There is considerable literature on past changes in 
  streamflow&#151;caused by human influences or natural climatic variability&#151;and 
  associated river channel changes (Rumsby and Mackin, 1994) but very little on 
  possible future channel changes. This largely reflects a lack of numerical models 
  to simulate erosion and sedimentation processes; assessments of possible future 
  channel changes that have been made have been inferred from past changes. In 
  northern England, for example, Rumsby and Mackin (1994) show that periods with 
  large numbers of large floods are characterized by channel incision, whereas 
  periods with few floods were characterized by lateral reworking and sediment 
  transfer. Increased flooding in the future therefore could be associated with 
  increased channel erosion.</p>
<p>The density of the drainage network reflects the signature of climate on topography. 
  Moglen et al. (1998) show that drainage density is sensitive to climate change 
  but also that the direction of change in density depends not only on climate 
  change but also on the current climate regime.</p>
<p>Hanratty and Stefan (1998) simulated streamflow and sediment yield in a small 
  catchment in Minnesota. The scenario they used produced a reduction in sediment 
  yield, largely as a result of reduced soil erosion, but their confidence in 
  the model results was low. In fact, the lack of physically based models of river 
  channel form and sediment transport means that the confidence in estimates of 
  the effect of climate change on river channels is low in general.</p>
<h3><a name="4313"></a>4.3.13. Climate Change and Climatic Variability</h3>
<p>Even in the absence of a human-induced climate change, hydrological behavior 
  will vary not only from year to year but also from decade to decade (see <a href="162.htm">Section 
  4.2</a>). Hulme et al. (1999) simulated streamflow across Europe under four 
  climate change scenarios for the 2050s (based on four different simulations 
  from the HadCM2 climate model) and seven scenarios representing different 30-year 
  climates extracted from a long run of the HadCM2 model with no GHG forcing. 
  They show that natural multi-decadal (30-year) variability in average annual 
  runoff is high across most of Europe and that this natural variability in runoff 
  in mid-latitude Europe is greater than the simulated signal of climate change. 
  In northern and southern Europe, the magnitude of climate change by the 2050s 
  is greater than the magnitude of natural variability. However, the spatial patterns 
  of climate change and climatic variability are very different, with a much more 
  coherent (usually north-south) pattern in the climate change signal. Nevertheless, 
  the results indicate that, for individual catchments in certain areas, the magnitude 
  of climate change effects on some indicators of streamflow may be smaller than 
  natural climatic variability for several decades, whereas in other areas, the 
  climate change signal will be larger than past experience.</p>
