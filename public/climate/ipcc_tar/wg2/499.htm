<h4>13.2.1.3. Coastal Zones </h4>
<p>Coastal zones in Europe contain large human populations and significant socioeconomic 
  activity. They also support diverse ecosystems that provide significant habitats 
  and sources of food. Significant inhabited coastal areas in countries such as 
  The Netherlands, England, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Poland already are below 
  normal high-tide levels, and more extensive areas are vulnerable to flooding 
  from storm surges. Hard defenses to prevent such flooding, combined with the 
  loss of the seaward edge of coastal habitats as a result of existing rates of 
  sea-level rise, already are causing significant coastal squeeze in many locations 
  (e.g., Pye and French, 1993; Rigg et al., 1997; Lee, 1998). Deltaic areas often 
  are particularly threatened because they naturally subside and may have been 
  sediment-starved by dam construction (e.g., Sanchez-Arcilla et al., 1998). Other 
  nonclimate change factors such as pollution may condition the impacts of climate 
  change. Information further to the summary given below appears in the chapter 
  on coasts in the European ACACIA report (Nicholls, 2000). </p>
<p>Climate change could cause important impacts on coastal zones, particularly 
  via sea-level rise and changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme 
  events such as storms and associated surges. Under the SRES climate change scenarios, 
  global sea level is expected to rise by 13-68 cm by the 2050s. Regional and 
  local sea-level rise in Europe generally will differ from the global average 
  because of vertical land movements (glacial isostatic rebound, tectonic activity, 
  and subsidence). Deviations from the global mean sea level also will occur as 
  a result of oceanic effects such as changes in oceanic circulation, water density, 
  or wind and pressure patterns. Mediterranean sea levels have fallen by as much 
  as 20 mm relative to the Atlantic since 1960, probably as a result of declining 
  freshwater input and consequent seawater density increase (Tsimplis and Baker, 
  2000). Looking to the future, the net effect of these processes is likely to 
  be as much as 10% of global mean change to the 2080s (Gregory and Lowe, 2000).

<p>Sea-level rise can cause several direct impacts, including inundation and displacement 
  of wetlands and lowlands, coastal erosion, increased storm flooding and damage, 
  increased salinity in estuaries and coastal aquifers, and rising coastal water 
  tables and impeded drainage (Bijlsma et al., 1996). Potential indirect impacts 
  are numerous; they include changes in the distribution of bottom sediments, 
  changes in the functions of coastal ecosystems, and a wide range of socioeconomic 
  impacts on human activities.</p>

<p>Other climate change factors also may be important. For example, rising air 
  and sea temperatures may cause significant shifts in the timing and location 
  of tourism (Perry, 1999) and recreational and commercial fisheries and decrease 
  the incidence of sea ice during winter. These changes also may influence water 
  quality through the occurrence of algal blooms, which would have adverse effects 
  on tourism and human health (Kovats and Martens, 2000). Changes in the frequency 
  and track of extratropical storms are less certain. It is worth noting that 
  an analysis of the HadCM2 climate change simulations found a decrease in the 
  number of northern hemisphere storms, but with a tendency for deeper low centers 
  (Carnell and Senior, 1998). This would have important implications for coastal 
  areas, including an additional increase in flood risk. Several studies suggest 
  that storm surges in northwest Europe might change as a result of climate change 
  (von Storch and Reichardt, 1997; Flather and Smith, 1998; Lowe and Gregory, 
  1998), but further investigation is required to produce definitive results. 
  Storm occurrence has displayed significant interannual and interdecadal variability 
  over the past 100 years (WASA, 1998); this could produce important and costly 
  impacts without other changes (e.g., Peerbolte et al., 1991) and might interact 
  adversely with sea-level rise. </p>
<p>The impacts of sea-level rise would vary from place to place and would depend 
  on the magnitude of relative sea-level rise, coastal morphology/topography, 
  and human modifications. The most threatened coastal environments within Europe 
  are deltas, low-lying coastal plains, islands and barrier islands, beaches, 
  coastal wetlands, and estuaries (Beniston et al., 1998). Tidal range is a key 
  factor: In general, the smaller the tidal range, the greater the susceptibility 
  to a given rise in sea level. The Mediterranean and Baltic coasts have a low 
  tidal range (<1 m), which suggests that they will be more vulnerable to sea-level 
  rise than the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea coasts (Nicholls and Mimura, 1998). 
</p>
<p>A regional/global model of flood and coastal wetland losses described by Nicholls 
  et al. (1999) considers the interacting effects of sea-level rise, population 
  growth, and improvements in protection standards. All other climate factors 
  are assumed to be constant. This model allows the impacts of the SRES scenarios 
  on Europe [excluding the former Soviet Union (FSU)] to be explored. Because 
  increases in population and protection standards in Europe are minor, the major 
  changes are caused by sea-level rise. In 1990, about 25 million people were 
  estimated to live beneath the 1-in-1,000 year storm surge, with the largest 
  exposure along the Atlantic/North Sea seaboard. However, these people generally 
  are well protected from flooding now. The changes in flooding, shown in <a href="#tab133">Table 
  13-3</a>, indicate a significant increase in the incidence of coastal flooding 
  by the 2080s, assuming no adaptation, particularly around the Mediterranean. 
</p>
<p>Europe (excluding the FSU) is estimated to have at least 2,860 km<sup>2</sup> 
  of saltmarshes and 6,690 km<sup>2</sup> of other unvegetated intertidal habitat, 
  mainly composed of sites recognized in the Ramsar treaty. Based on coastal morphological 
  type and the presence or absence of coastal flood defenses, <a href="#tab134">Table 
  13-4</a> shows wetland losses resulting from sea-level rise. Wetland losses 
  are most significant around the Mediterranean and Baltic. Under the A2-high 
  scenario, wetlands in these regions could be eliminated. Any surviving wetlands 
  may be substantially altered. Such losses could have serious consequences for 
  biodiversity in Europe, particularly for wintering shorebird and marine fish 
  populations. </p>
<p>Available national results emphasize the large human and ecological values 
  that could be affected by sea-level rise. <a href="500.htm#tab135">Table 13-5</a> 
  shows results of national assessments in The Netherlands (Baarse et al.,1994; 
  Bijlsma et al., 1996), Poland (Zeidler, 1997), and Germany (Sterr and Simmering, 
  1996; Ebenhöh et al., 1997) for existing development and all costs adjusted 
  to 1990 US$. In <a href="500.htm#tab135">Table 13-5</a>, adaptation assumes 
  protection except in areas with low population density. People at risk are the 
  numbers of people flooded by storm surge in an average year. Adaptation/protection 
  costs for Poland include capital and annual running costs; % GNP assumes that 
  costs are all incurred in 1 year. Subnational and local studies from East Anglia, 
  UK (Turner et al., 1995); South Coast, UK (Ball et al., 1991); Rochefort sur 
  Mer, France (Auger, 1994); Estonia (Kont et al., 1997); and Ukraine (Lenhart 
  et al., 1996), as well as regional reviews (Tooley and Jelgersma, 1992; Nicholls 
  and Hoozemans, 1996) also support this conclusion. Many of Europe's largest 
  cities-such as London, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, and Thessaloniki-are built on 
  estuaries and lagoons (Frasetto, 1991). Such locations already are exposed to 
  storm surges, and climate change is an important factor to consider for long-term 
  planning and development. </p>
<p>Other values that may be affected include archaeological and cultural resources 
  at the coast; these resources sometimes are being recognized only now (Fulford 
  et al., 1997; Pye and Allen, 2000). In Venice, a 30-cm relative rise in sea 
  level in the 20th century has greatly increased the frequency of flooding and 
  damage to this unique medieval city; solutions to this problem are the subject 
  of a continuing debate and need to consider climate change (Consorzio Venezia 
  Nuova, 1997; Penning-Rowsell et al., 1998). </p>
