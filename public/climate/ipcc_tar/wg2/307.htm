<h2>7.1. Introduction and Purpose</h2>
<p> Humans live in a wide variety of settlements, ranging from hunter-gatherer 
  camps and villages of a handful of families to modern megacities and metropolitan 
  regions of tens of millions of inhabitants. Settlement economic and social structure-and 
  the components of infrastructure that support settlements: energy, water supply, 
  transportation, drains, waste disposal, and so forth-have varying degrees of 
  vulnerability to climate change and generally are evolving far more quickly 
  than the natural environment. Settlements can be affected directly through changes 
  in human health and infrastructure and indirectly through impacts on the environment, 
  natural resources, and local industries such as tourism or agriculture. Furthermore, 
  these effects on human settlements theoretically could lead to tertiary impacts 
  such as altered land use, redistribution of population and activities to other 
  regions, and altered trade patterns among regions, resulting in still further 
  changes in natural resources and other activities. Tertiary effects, however, 
  are largely speculative at the current state of knowledge. Some of these tertiary 
  effects could be either positive or negative at the regional level. </p>
<h3><a name="711"></a>7.1.1. Overview of the SAR </h3>
<p> This chapter builds on <a href="411.htm">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="463.htm">12</a> 
  of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996), and on the findings in the 
  Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (RICC) (IPCC, 1998). The 
  SAR identifies the most vulnerable types of communities, many examples of which 
  are documented in RICC. The SAR states that the most vulnerable communities 
  are not only poorer coastal and agrarian communities in arid areas identified 
  in the First Assessment Report in 1990; they also include a great variety of 
  settlements, most of them informal or illegal and with a predominance of low-income 
  residents, built on hazardous sites such as wetlands or steep hillsides in or 
  around many urban areas in the developing world. </p>
<p>The SAR and RICC also identify two categories of climate-sensitive industries. 
  Sectors with activities that are sensitive to climate include construction, 
  transportation operations and infrastructure, energy transportation and transmission, 
  offshore oil and gas, thermal power generation, water availability for industry, 
  pollution control, coastal-sited industry, and tourism and recreation. Sectors 
  in which economic activity is dependent on climate-sensitive resources are agroindustry, 
  biomass, and other renewable energy. </p>
<p>The SAR notes that infrastructure typically is designed to tolerate a reasonable 
  level of variability within the climate regime that existed when it was designed 
  and built. However, climate change could affect both average conditions and 
  the probability of extreme events. </p>
<p>This Third Assessment Report (TAR) confirms most of these conclusions. However, 
  the analyses in the SAR and RICC are concerned mostly with identifying and documenting 
  potential effects. The TAR assesses their relative importance and the certainty/confidence 
  of the conclusions reached. </p>
<p>Although literature published since the SAR was issued has not changed the 
  catalog of potential impacts, much more has been learned about the quantitative 
  details of many of the effects, which are being studied more systematically 
  than was true 5-10 years ago. The results are becoming somewhat more quantitative, 
  and it is becoming possible to assign confidence ratings to many of the effects 
  for the first time. More also is known concerning adaptation options. It is 
  now possible to describe many of the options more quantitatively and in the 
  context of development, sustainability, and equity (see Munasinghe, 2000). Energy, 
  industry, and infrastructure are treated as part of settlements in the TAR. 
</p>
<h3><a name="712"></a>7.1.2. Overview of Types of Effects </h3>
<p>Human settlements integrate many climate impacts initially felt in other sectors 
  and differ from each other in geographic location, size, economic circumstances, 
  and technical, political, institutional, and social capacities. Climate affects 
  human settlements by one of three major pathways, which provides an organizational 
  structure for the settlements effects discussion in this chapter: </p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li>Changes in productive capacity (e.g., in agriculture or fisheries) or changes 
    in market demand for goods and services produced in settlements (including 
    demand from those living nearby and from tourism). The importance of this 
    impact depends on the range of economic alternatives. Rural settlements generally 
    depend on one or two resources, whereas urban settlements usually (but not 
    always) have a broader array of alternative resources. Impacts also depend 
    on the adaptive capacity of the settlement, which in turn depends on socioeconomic 
    factors such as the wealth, human capital, and institutional capability of 
    the settlement. <br>
  <li>Physical infrastructure or services may be directly affected (e.g., by flooding). 
    Concentration of population and infrastructure in urban areas can mean higher 
    numbers of persons and value of physical capital at risk, although there also 
    are many economies of scale and proximity that help to assure well-managed 
    infrastructure and provision of services such as fire protection and may help 
    reduce risk. Smaller settlements (including villages and small urban centers) 
    and many larger urban centers in Africa and much of Asia, Latin America, and 
    the Caribbean often have less wealth, political power, and institutional capacity 
    to reduce risks in this way. <br>
  <li>Populations may be directly affected through extreme weather, changes in 
    health status, or migration. Extreme weather episodes may lead to changes 
    in deaths, injuries, or illness. Health status may improve as a result of 
    less cold stress, for example, or deteriorate as a result of more heat stress 
    and disease. 
</ol>
<p>The discussion of impacts on human settlements, energy, and industry that follows 
  begins with a discussion of nonclimate trends that affect settlements. The discussion 
  then assesses potential impacts of climate change on three general types of 
  settlements: resource-dependent settlements; riverine, coastal, and steeplands 
  settlements; and urban settlements. This discussion is followed by a discussion 
  of impacts on the energy sector and industries that may be particularly affected 
  by climate change and an assessment of potential impacts on infrastructure. 
  The chapter next discusses management and adaptation issues and integration 
  of impacts across sectors, and it closes with a review of science and information 
  needs. </p>
