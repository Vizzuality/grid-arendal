<h2>5.7. Lakes and Streams </h2>
<p>Lake and stream ecosystems include many familiar places: large and small lakes, 
  permanent and temporary ponds, and streams&#151;from tiny, often temporary rivulets 
  at headwaters to powerful floodplain rivers discharging from our continents. 
  Freshwaters (lakes and rivers), which are so valuable for the sustainability 
  of life as we know it, constitute only 0.0091% of the Earth's surface waters 
  by volume. This is a great deal less than 0.5% for groundwater and 97.3% for 
  oceans (Cole, 1994). Lakes and rivers are used intensively for recreation and 
  are aesthetically valued. These values include fishing, hunting, swimming, boating, 
  skating, and simply enjoying the view. </p>
<p>This section focusses on physical and biological processes and how they affect 
  goods and services from lakes and streams that are regulated by these processes. 
  The emphasis is on food, carbon, and biodiversity. Hydrology and water supply 
  are covered in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>; oceans and coastal systems are 
  covered in <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>. Hydrological goods and services 
  are covered largely in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>, but are considered here 
  as an interactive influence of climate change on inland waters. Wetlands are 
  covered in <a href="267.htm">Section 5.8</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="571"></a>5.7.1. Status of Goods and Services</h3>
<p>Products from lakes and streams include fisheries (fish, amphibians, crustaceans, 
  and mollusks) and aquaculture; services include biodiversity, recreation, aesthetics, 
  and biogeochemical cycling. A detailed list of services from freshwater ecosystems 
  includes many items that are undervalued in economic terms and often are unrecognized 
  and unappreciated&#151;for example, their role in the carbon cycle. </p>
<p>Reported catches in freshwater and inland fisheries were 7.7 Mt of biomass 
  in 1996 (FAO, 1999b) and 15.1 Mt from aquaculture. China accounts for 80% of 
  aquaculture production. Actual landings in capture fisheries are believed to 
  be two to three times larger owing to nonreporting (FAO, 1999c). About 100 fish 
  species are reported in world catches&#151;primarily cyprinids, cichlids, snakeheads, 
  catfish, and barbs. Asia and China report the largest catches; Africa is second; 
  North America ranks relatively low. River and large reservoir fisheries are 
  important.</p>
<p>Recreational fish catches are included in the foregoing world catches and were 
  reported to be 0.48 Mt in 1990 (FAO, 1992). This is likely to be an underestimate 
  because only 30 (of 200) countries reported recreational catches. Recreational 
  fishing is increasing in developed and developing countries. The number of anglers 
  is estimated at 21.3 million in 22 European countries, 29.7 million in the United 
  States, and 4.2 million in Canada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1996; Department 
  of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada, 1998). Total expenditures for recreational 
  angling are in the billions of dollars&#151;for example, $38 billion in the 
  United States in 1996 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1996) and $4.9 billion 
  in Canada in 1995.</p>
<p>Freshwaters are known for high biodiversity and endemism owing to their island-like 
  nature, which leads to speciation and reduces invasions of competitors and predators. 
  Of about 28,000 fish species known on Earth, 41% are freshwater species and 
  58% are marine, of which 1% spend part of their lives in freshwater (Moyle and 
  Cech, 1996). Individual east African Rift Valley lakes contain species flocks 
  of almost 250 cichlid species. In Lake Baikal in Russia, 35% of the plants and 
  65% of the animals are endemic (Burgis and Morris, 1987). At the global level, 
  biodiversity in many lakes has been decreasing in recent decades, with many 
  species becoming extinct (Naiman et al., 1995b). The trend is likely to continue, 
  with many species that now are listed as endangered or threatened becoming extinct 
  (IUCN, 1996). The causes for these extinctions are likely to be related to the 
  many pressures listed below. </p>
<p>Inland waters play a major role in biogeochemical cycling of elements and compounds 
  such as carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, silica, calcium, and toxic substances. 
  The general roles are storage, transformation, and transport (Stumm and Morgan, 
  1996). Storage is important because sediments and associated minerals accumulate 
  in the bottom sediments of lakes, reservoirs, and floodplains. Transformation 
  includes organic waste purification and detoxification of various human created 
  compounds such as insecticides. Water movement redistributes these spatially. 
</p>
<p>Of special interest here is the role of freshwaters in carbon storage and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) release. Organic carbon from primary production 
  in lakes and adjacent riparian lands accumulates in sediments; estimates are 
  that 319 Mt yr<sup>-1</sup> are buried in the 3.03 million km<sup>2</sup> of 
  small and large lakes, reservoirs, and inland seas worldwide (USGS, 1999; see 
  also Stallard, 1998). This estimate excludes amounts for peatlands (96 Mt yr<sup>-1</sup>). 
  It is three times greater than estimates for the ocean in absolute terms (97 
  Mt yr<sup>-1</sup>) even given the relatively small area of inland waters. Lakes 
  also are a source of GHGs. Lakes become supersaturated with dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  and net gas exchange is from the lake to the atmosphere (Cole et al., 1994). 
  For example, during summer in Lake P&auml;&auml;j&auml;rv, Finland, the amount 
  of carbon from respiration in the water column was greater than that produced 
  by phytoplankton and sedimentation combined (Kankaala et al., 1996). Pulses 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> from the water column and CH<sub>4</sub> from sediments are 
  released to the atmosphere during spring and fall mixing of the water column 
  of dimictic lakes (Kratz et al., 1987; Riera et al., 1999; Kortelainen et al., 
  2001). Methane releases, especially from the littoral zone, can be significant 
  in lakes and reservoirs (Fearnside, 1995, 1997; Alm et al., 1997a; Hyv&ouml;nen 
  et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Hydroelectric power plants generally are assumed to emit less CO<sub>2</sub> 
  than fossil fuel plants. However, a hydroelectric reservoir may contribute more 
  to GHGs over 100 years of operation than a fossil fuel plant that produces an 
  equivalent amount of electricity (Fearnside, 1997). Emissions are likely to 
  be high in the first few decades and then decrease. This is exemplified by a 
  Brazilian hydroelectric reservoir that is simulated to release a large quantity 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> during the first 10 years after filling (ca. 5-27 Mt 
  CO<sub>2</sub> gas yr<sup>-1</sup>) but relatively low amounts from years 30 
  to 100. Releases of CH<sub>4</sub> were simulated to be high for at least 100 
  years (about 0.05-0.1 Mt CH<sub>4</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with actual estimates 
  for 1990 of 0.09 Mt) (Fearnside, 1995, 1997). </p>
