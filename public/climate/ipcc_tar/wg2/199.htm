<p><b>Forests and Woodlands </b></p>
<p>Loss in forest cover appears to have slowed in recent years relative to 1980-1995. 
  However, fragmentation, nonsustainable logging of mature forests, degradation, 
  and development of infrastructure&#151;all leading to losses of biomass&#151;have 
  occurred over significant areas in developing and developed countries (high 
  confidence). Pressure from disturbances such as fires appears to be increasing 
  around the world. Fire suppression in temperate managed and unmanaged forests 
  with access to infrastructure and human capital has been largely successful, 
  but regions with comparatively less infrastructure have been more susceptible 
  to natural and human-caused fires. Deforestation will continue to be the dominant 
  factor influencing land-use change in tropical regions. Timber harvests near 
  roads and mills in tropical regions are likely to continue to fragment and damage 
  natural forests (high confidence).<br>
</p>
<p>Non-wood forest products (NWFP) such as edible mushrooms, nuts, fruits, palm 
  hearts, herbs, spices, gums, aromatic plants, game, fodder, rattan, medicinal 
  and cosmetic products, resins, and the like make important contributions to 
  household income, food security, national economies, and the environmental objectives 
  of conservation of biodiversity. <br>
</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities </i> 
<ul>
  <li>Forest response to climate change and other pressures will alter future 
    carbon storage in forests, but the global extent and direction of change is 
    unknown.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Recent experimental evidence suggests that the net balance between net primary 
    productivity (NPP&#151;usually assumed to increase with warming, but challenged 
    by recent studies), heterotrophic respiration (often assumed to increase with 
    warming, but also challenged by recent studies), and disturbance releases 
    (often ignored, but shown to be important in boreal estimates of net biome 
    productivity) is no longer as clear as stated in the SAR. </li>
  <li>Research reported since the SAR confirms the view that the largest and earliest 
    impacts induced by climate change are likely to occur in boreal forests, where 
    changes in weather-related disturbance regimes and nutrient cycling are primary 
    controls on productivity (high confidence). The effect of these changes on 
    NPP and carbon storage is uncertain. </li>
  <li>Since the SAR, free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) experiments suggest 
    that tree growth rates may increase, litterfall and fine root increment may 
    increase, and total NPP may increase, but these effects are expected to saturate 
    because forest stands tend toward maximum carrying capacity, and plants may 
    become acclimated to increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels (medium confidence). 
  </li>
  <li>Questions of saturation of the CO<sub>2</sub> response can be addressed 
    through longer term experiments on tree species grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
    in open-top chambers under field conditions over several growing seasons. 
    Results from these experiments show continued and consistent stimulation of 
    photosynthesis and little evidence of long-term loss of sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>; 
    the relative effect on aboveground dry mass was highly variable and greater 
    than indicated by seedling studies, and the annual increase in wood mass per 
    unit of leaf area increased (high confidence). </li>
  <li>Contrary to the SAR, global timber market studies that include adaptation 
    suggest that climate change will increase global timber supply and enhance 
    existing market trends toward rising market share in developing countries. 
    Consumers are likely to benefit from lower timber prices; producers may gain 
    or lose, depending on regional changes in timber productivity and potential 
    dieback effects. Studies that do not consider global market forces, timber 
    prices, or adaptation predict that supply in boreal regions could decline 
    (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>Industrial timber harvests are predicted to increase by 1-2% yr<sup>-1</sup>. 
    The area of industrial timber plantations is likely to continue to expand, 
    and management in second-growth forests in temperate regions is likely to 
    continue to intensify, taking pressure off natural forests for harvests (high 
    confidence).</li>
  <li>At the regional and global scale, the extent and nature of adaptation will 
    depend primarily on wood and non-wood product prices, the relative value of 
    substitutes, the cost of management, and technology. On specific sites, changes 
    in forest growth and productivity will constrain&#151;and could limit&#151;choices 
    of adaptation strategies (high confidence). In markets, prices will mediate 
    adaptation through land and product management. Adaptation in managed forests 
    will include salvaging dead and dying timber and replanting with new species 
    that are better suited to the new climate.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Lakes and Rivers</b></p>
<p>Capture, culture, and recreational fisheries are reported to land about 23 
  Mt yr<sup>-1</sup> of biomass, but the actual numbers probably are twice that. 
  Fish species in freshwater total about 11,800. High levels of endemism are common 
  for many different groups of freshwater organisms. In addition to climatic changes, 
  lakes and rivers are impacted by pressures such as land and water use, pollution, 
  capture and culture fisheries, water extraction, and hydrologic engineering 
  structures such as dams, dykes, and channelization (well established). These 
  pressures interact with pressures from climate change and vary in their impact 
  even at local levels mediated through changes in hydrology (medium confidence).<br>
</p>
<i>Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities </i>
<ul>
  <li>A 150-year trend in 26 lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere averaging 
    9 days later freeze and 10 days earlier ice breakup has resulted from a 1.8&deg;C 
    increase in air temperature (very high confidence).</li>
  <li>Empirical and simulation studies show that elevated water temperature increases 
    summer anoxia in deep waters of stratified lakes (high confidence).</li>
  <li>There has been an observed poleward movement of southern and northern boundaries 
    of fish distributions (high confidence).</li>
  <li>There is a loss of habitat for cold- and coolwater fishes and gain in habitat 
    for warmwater fishes (high confidence).</li>
  <li>There are complex relations between warmer temperature, more episodic rainfall, 
    and poleward movement of warm-water zooplanktivorous fishes, which may exacerbate 
    eutrophication of lakes and rivers (medium confidence).</li>
  <li>Human activities to manage water flow may exacerbate the impact on lakes 
    and rivers (medium confidence); for example, the increase in hydrologic engineering 
    structures is likely to result in fewer free-flowing streams (medium confidence). 
    Attempts to manage the poleward movement of fauna and flora, especially in 
    lakes whose isolation is likely to slow down species from moving poleward, 
    is likely to be contentious and produce frequent surprises and unexpected 
    dynamics of freshwater communities (medium confidence). </li>
  <li>New opportunities may be provided for aquaculture of warmer water species 
    in more poleward locations (medium confidence). </li>
  <li>As a class of ecosystems, inland waters are vulnerable to climatic change 
    and other pressures, owing to their small size and position downstream from 
    many human activities (high confidence). The most vulnerable elements include 
    reduction and loss of lake and river ice (very high confidence), loss of habitat 
    for coldwater fish (very high confidence), increases in extinctions and invasions 
    of exotics (high confidence), and potential exacerbation of existing pollution 
    problems such as eutrophication, toxics, acid rain, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) 
    radiation (medium confidence). </li>
