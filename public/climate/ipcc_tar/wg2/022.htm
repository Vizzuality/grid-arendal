<h1>1. Scope and Approach of the Assessment </h1>
<h2><a name="11"></a>1.1. Mandate of the Assessment</h2>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by World 
  Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) 
  in 1988 to assess scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information that 
  is relevant in understanding human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, 
  and options for mitigation and adaptation. The IPCC currently is organized into 
  three Working Groups: Working Group I (WGI) addresses observed and projected 
  changes in climate; Working Group II (WGII) addresses vulnerability, impacts, 
  and adaptation related to climate change; and Working Group III (WGIII) addresses 
  options for mitigation of climate change.</p>
<p>This volume&#151;<i>Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability</i>&#151;is 
  the WGII contribution to the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) on scientific, 
  technical, environmental, economic, and social issues associated with the climate 
  system and climate change.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> WGII's 
  mandate for the TAR is to assess the vulnerability of ecological systems, socioeconomic 
  sectors, and human health to climate change as well as potential impacts of 
  climate change, positive and negative, on these systems. This assessment also 
  examines the feasibility of adaptation to enhance the positive effects of climate 
  change and ameliorate negative effects. This new assessment builds on previous 
  IPCC assessments, reexamining key findings of earlier assessments and emphasizing 
  new information and implications from more recent studies.</p>

<p><a name="figts1"></a>Human activities&#151;primarily burning of fossil fuels 
  and changes in land cover&#151;are modifying the concentration of atmospheric 
  constituents or properties of the surface that absorb or scatter radiant energy. 
  The WGI contribution to the TAR&#151;<i><a href="../wg1/index.htm">Climate Change 2001: 
  The Scientific Basis</a></i>&#151;found, "In the light of new evidence 
  and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming 
  over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse 
  gas concentrations." Future changes in climate are expected to include 
  additional warming, changes in precipitation patterns and amounts, sea-level 
  rise, and changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme events.</p>
<p><i>The stakes associated with projected changes in climate are high.</i> Numerous 
  Earth systems that sustain human societies are sensitive to climate and will 
  be impacted by changes in climate (very high confidence). Impacts can be expected 
  in ocean circulation; sea level; the water cycle; carbon and nutrient cycles; 
  air quality; the productivity and structure of natural ecosystems; the productivity 
  of agricultural, grazing, and timber lands; and the geographic distribution, 
  behavior, abundance, and survival of plant and animal species, including vectors 
  and hosts of human disease. Changes in these systems in response to climate 
  change, as well as direct effects of climate change on humans, would affect 
  human welfare, positively and negatively. Human welfare would be impacted through 
  changes in supplies of and demands for water, food, energy, and other tangible 
  goods that are derived from these systems; changes in opportunities for nonconsumptive 
  uses of the environment for recreation and tourism; changes in non-use values 
  of the environment such as cultural and preservation values; changes in incomes; 
  changes in loss of property and lives from extreme climate phenomena; and changes 
  in human health. Climate change impacts will affect the prospects for sustainable 
  development in different parts of the world and may further widen existing inequalities. 
  Impacts will vary in distribution across people, places, and times (very high 
  confidence), raising important questions about equity.</p>
<p>Although the stakes are demonstrably high, the risks associated with climate 
  change are less easily established. Risks are a function of the probability 
  and magnitude of different types of impacts. The WGII report assesses advances 
  in the state of knowledge regarding impacts of climate stimuli to which systems 
  may be exposed, the sensitivity of exposed systems to changes in climate stimuli, 
  their adaptive capacity to alleviate or cope with adverse impacts or enhance 
  beneficial ones, and their vulnerability to adverse impacts (see <a href="#boxts1">Box 
  1</a>). Possible impacts include impacts that threaten substantial and irreversible 
  damage to or loss of some systems within the next century; modest impacts to 
  which systems may readily adapt; and impacts that would be beneficial for some 
  systems.</p>
<p><a href="#figts1">Figure TS-1</a> illustrates the scope of the WGII assessment 
  and its relation to other parts of the climate change system. Human activities 
  that change the climate expose natural and human systems to an altered set of 
  stresses or stimuli. Systems that are sensitive to these stimuli are affected 
  or impacted by the changes, which can trigger autonomous, or expected, adaptations. 
  These autonomous adaptations will reshape the residual or net impacts of climate 
  change. Policy responses in reaction to impacts already perceived or in anticipation 
  of potential future impacts can take the form of planned adaptations to lessen 
  adverse effects or enhance beneficial ones. Policy responses also can take the 
  form of actions to mitigate climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission 
  reductions and enhancement of sinks. The WGII assessment focuses on the central 
  box of <a href="#figts1">Figure TS-1</a>&#151;exposure, impacts, and vulnerabilities&#151;and 
  the adaptation policy loop.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 1. Climate Change<br>
        Sensitivity, Adaptability, and Vulnerability </b> </div>
      <p><i>Sensitivity</i> is the degree to which a system is affected, either 
        adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli. Climate-related 
        stimuli encompass all the elements of climate change, including mean climate 
        characteristics, climate variability, and the frequency and magnitude 
        of extremes. The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in 
        response to a change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) 
        or indirect (e.g., damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal 
        flooding due to sea-level rise).</p>
      <p><i>Adaptive capacity</i> is the ability of a system to adjust to climate 
        change, including climate variability and extremes, to moderate potential 
        damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the<br>
        consequences. </p>
      <p><i>Vulnerability</i> is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, 
        or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate 
        variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, 
        magnitude and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is 
        exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.</p>
