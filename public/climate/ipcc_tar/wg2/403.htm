<h4>10.2.6.3. Climatic Factors in Desertification </h4>
<p>Precipitation and temperature determine the potential distribution of terrestrial 
  vegetation and constitute principal factors in the genesis and evolution of 
  soil. Extended droughts in certain arid lands have initiated or exacerbated 
  desertification. In the past 25 years, the Sahel has experienced the most substantial 
  and sustained decline in rainfall recorded anywhere in the world within the 
  period of instrumental measurements (Hulme and Kelly, 1997). Linear regression 
  of 1901-1990 rainfall data from 24 stations in the west African Sahel yields 
  a negative slope amounting to a decline of 1.9 standard deviations in the period 
  1950-1985 (Nicholson and Palao, 1993). Since 1971, the average of all stations 
  fell below the 89-year average and showed a persistent downward trend since 
  1951.</p>
<p>Because evapotranspiration constitutes the only local input to the hydrological 
  cycle in areas without surface water, reduction in vegetative cover may lead 
  to reduced precipitation, initiating a positive feedback cycle. Degradation 
  of vegetation cover in moister areas south of the Sahel may have decreased continental 
  evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation in the Sahel (Xue, 1997).</p>
<p>A positive feedback mechanism between vegetation cover and albedo may help 
  to explain the Sahel drought (Charney, 1975). Some research supports an albedo-precipitation 
  feedback mechanism (Otterman, 1974; Cunnington and Rowntree, 1986; Xue <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1990; Diedhiou and Mahfouf, 1996; Zheng and Eltahir, 1997; Zeng <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1999), although other research disputes the importance of albedo (Jackson 
  and Idso, 1974; Ripley, 1976; Wendler and Eaton, 1983; Gornitz and NASA, 1985; 
  Nicholson <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Nicholson, 2000).</p>
<p>Degraded land also may increase atmospheric dust and aerosols, which influence 
  precipitation (see <a href="380.htm#10132">Section 10.1.3.2</a>).</p>
<p>SST anomalies, often related to ENSO or NAO, also contribute to rainfall variability 
  in the Sahel (Lamb, 1978; Folland <i>et al.,</i> 1986; Hulme and Kelly, 1997; 
  Nicholson and Kim, 1997; Hulme <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Lamb (1978) observes that 
  droughts in west Africa correlate with warm SST in the tropical south Atlantic. 
  Examining oceanographic and meteorological data from the period 1901-1985, 
  Folland <i>et al. </i>(1986) found that persistent wet and dry periods in the 
  Sahel were related to contrasting patterns of SST anomalies on a near-global 
  scale. When northern hemisphere oceans were cold, rainfall in the Sahel was 
  low.</p>
<p>Street-Perrott and Perrott (1990) demonstrate that injections of freshwater 
  into the north Atlantic (such as from glacial melt) decrease salinity&#151;stabilizing 
  the water column, inhibiting deep convection, and reducing northern transport 
  of heat by the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, which is driven by a north-south 
  SST gradient. This decreases evaporation from the ocean surface, causing drought 
  in the Sahel and Mexico. From 1982 to 1990, Mynemi et al. (1996) found a correlation 
  between ENSO-cycle SST anomalies and vegetative production in Africa. They found 
  that warmer eastern equatorial Pacific waters during ENSO episodes correlated 
  with rainfall of &lt;1,000 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over certain African regions.</p>
<p>A combination of factors&#151;including vegetation cover, soil moisture, and 
  SST&#151;best explains the reduction in rainfall in the Sahel. Diedhiou and 
  Mahfouf (1996) modeled changes in albedo, soil moisture, land surface roughness, 
  and SST anomalies and calculated a rainfall deficit over the Sahel similar to 
  observed patterns. Eltahir and Gong (1996) suggest that a meridional distribution 
  of boundary-layer entropy regulates the dynamics of monsoon circulation over 
  west Africa, explaining observed correlations of SST to rainfall and the sensitivity 
  of monsoon circulation to land-cover changes. A coupled surface-atmosphere model 
  indicates that&#151;whether anthropogenic factors or changes in SST initiated 
  the Sahel drought of 1968-1973&#151;permanent loss of Sahel savanna vegetation 
  would permit drought conditions to persist (Wang and Eltahir, 2000). Zeng <i>et 
  al.</i> (1999) compared actual rainfall data from the period 1950-1998 
  with the output of a coupled atmosphere-land-vegetation model incorporating 
  SST, soil moisture, and vegetative cover. Their results indicate that actual 
  rainfall anomalies are only weakly correlated to SST by itself. Only when the 
  model includes variations in vegetative cover and soil moisture does it come 
  close to matching actual rainfall data. Modeling the importance of SST, sea 
  ice, and vegetative cover to the abrupt desertification of the Sahara 4,000-6,000 
  years ago, Claussen <i>et al</i>. (1999) show that changes in vegetative cover 
  best explain changes in temperature and precipitation.<br>

<h4>10.2.6.4. Linkages and Feedbacks between Desertification and Climate<a name="10264"></a></h4>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate change might exacerbate desertification through 
  alteration of spatial and temporal patterns in temperature, rainfall, solar 
  insolation, and winds. Conversely, desertification aggravates CO<sub>2</sub>-induced 
  climate change through the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from cleared and dead vegetation 
  and through the reduction of the carbon sequestration potential of desertified 
  land.</p>
<p>Areas that experience reduced rainfall and increased temperature as a result 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate change also could experience declines in agricultural 
  yields, livestock yields, and tree cover, placing local people at risk of famine.</p>
<p>Lower soil moisture and sparser vegetative cover also would leave soil more 
  susceptible to wind erosion. Reduction of organic matter inputs and increased 
  oxidation of soil organic matter (SOM) could reduce the long-term water-retention 
  capacity of soil, exacerbating desertification. Sample plots in Niger lost 46 
  t ha<sup>-1</sup> in just four windstorms in 1993 (Sterk <i>et al., </i>1996), 
  releasing 180 &plusmn; 80 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of soil carbon 
  (Buerkert <i>et al.,</i> 1996). Moreover, increased wind erosion increases wind-blown 
  mineral dust, which may increase absorption of radiation in the atmosphere (Nicholson 
  and Kim, 1997).</p>
<p>Desertification from anthropogenic and climatic factors in Senegal caused a 
  fall in standing-wood biomass of 26 kg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in 
  the period 1956-1993, releasing carbon at the rate of 60 kg C cap<sup>-1</sup> 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Gonzalez, 1997).</p>
<p>Although altered surface albedo may increase surface air temperatures locally 
  (Williams and Balling, 1996), the effect of desertification on global mean temperature 
  is unlikely to have exceeded 0.05&deg;C in the past century (Hulme and Kelly, 
  1997).</p>
