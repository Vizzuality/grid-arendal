<h3><a name="1632"></a>16.3.2 Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability </h3>
<p>Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic where water is close to its melting point 
  are highly sensitive to climate change, rendering their biota and socioeconomic 
  life particularly vulnerable. Adaptation to climate change will occur in natural 
  polar ecosystems mainly through migration and changing mixes of species. This 
  may cause some species to become threatened (e.g., walrus, seals, polar bears), 
  whereas others may flourish (e.g., fish, penguins). Although such changes may 
  be disruptive to many local ecological systems and particular species, the possibility 
  remains that predicted climate change eventually will increase the overall productivity 
  of natural systems in polar regions. </p>
<p>For people, successful future adaptation to change depends on technological 
  advances, institutional arrangements, availability of financing, and information 
  exchange. Stakeholders must be involved in studies from the beginning as well 
  as in discussions of any adaptive and mitigative measures (Weller and Lange, 
  1999). For indigenous communities following traditional lifestyles, opportunities 
  for adaptation to climate change appear to be limited. Long-term climate change, 
  combined with other stresses, may cause the decline and eventual disappearance 
  of communities. Technologically developed communities are likely to adapt quite 
  readily to climate change by adopting altered modes of transport and by increased 
  investment to take advantage of new commercial and trade opportunities.<br>
</p>
<p>Except in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean probably 
  will respond slowly to climate change; consequently, there will be less obvious 
  impact in this region by 2100. Nevertheless, these areas are vulnerable because 
  climate change could initiate millennial-scale processes with the potential 
  to cause irreversible impacts on ice sheets, global ocean circulation, and sea-level 
  rise. Antarctic drivers of sea-level rise, slowdown of the ocean thermohaline 
  circulation, and changes in marine ecological habitats will continue for several 
  centuries, long after GHG emissions are stabilized.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="1633"></a>16.3.3. Development, Sustainability, and Equity </h3>
<p>Distinctive patterns of development in the Arctic arise from the special nature 
  of northern communities. The region is marked by decentralized administration 
  and the presence of relict military establishments. The main forms of resource 
  use are oil, gas, and mineral mining (e.g., lead, zinc, gold, diamonds), ecotourism, 
  fishing, and traditional hunting and gathering by indigenous peoples. Further 
  development of these resources is likely. Maintenance of existing infrastructure 
  is likely to be more costly. Transportation may be affected as permafrost thaws 
  and ice disappears. Waste disposal strategies also will have to change. Reduced 
  sea ice will change strategic defense situations, especially for navies of the 
  large powers flanking the Arctic. Sovereignty issues are of concern because 
  of confusion over northern boundaries, the increased likelihood of territorial 
  disputes as ice gives way to open water, and new northern sea routes create 
  new trade patterns. Changes in sea ice and easier navigation may bring new policy 
  initiatives, and improved sea access will greatly increase ecotourism. Overall, 
  there will be increased human activity in the Arctic. <br>
</p>
<p>There are large regional differences across the Arctic in development, infrastructure, 
  and ability of people to cope with climate change. Increasingly, Arctic communities 
  are sustainable only with support from the south. Indigenous peoples are more 
  sensitive to climate change than nonindigenous peoples. Their homelands and 
  hunting habitats will be directly affected, and they cannot easily retreat to 
  less affected areas. Some native peoples may be able to adapt, but probably 
  at the expense of traditional lifestyles. Nonindigenous peoples also are vulnerable 
  where links with the south are broken by changes in the physical environment 
  and altered political circumstances. Their lifestyles require high capital investment, 
  which will have to be maintained or even increased for them to be adaptable 
  to climate change. With climate change, economies that rely on support from 
  the south may become more expensive because of disrupted land-based transport, 
  and this may not be sustainable. However, new transport opportunities, growing 
  communities, and easier mining will create new wealth&#151;but only for those 
  who move away from traditional lifestyles. <br>
</p>
<p>In Antarctica, future use of the continent is governed by the Antarctic Treaty, 
  and there are no permanent residents. With regard to policy issues, changes 
  in the climate may mean less sea ice, easier access for ecotourism, and increased 
  pressure on the environment. Sustaining the Antarctic's pristine nature 
  may become more difficult. </p>
