<h4>3.1.3.1. Exploratory Scenarios</h4>
<p>Exploratory (or descriptive) scenarios describe how the future might unfold, 
  according to known processes of change or as extrapolations of past trends. 
  They are sometimes described as BAU scenarios; often they involve no major interventions 
  or paridigm shifts in the organization or functioning of a system but merely 
  respect established constraints on future development (e.g., finite resources, 
  limits on consumption). However, the term "business-as-usual" may 
  be misleading because exploratory scenarios also can describe futures that bifurcate 
  at some point (an example might be uptake or rejection of a new technology) 
  or that make some assumptions about regulation and/or adaptation of a system. 
  The simplest model is a direct extrapolation of past trends (e.g., projection 
  of future agricultural crop productivity often is based on extrapolation of 
  recorded increases in productivity; Mela and Suvanto, 1987; Alexandratos, 1995). 
  Most climate scenarios considered in this report can be regarded as exploratory: 
  They are future climates that might occur in the absence of explicit policies 
  of GHG reduction.</p>

<p><a name="fig31"></a>Normative (or prescriptive) scenarios describe a prespecified 
  future, presenting "a picture of the world achievable (or avoidable) only 
  through certain actions. The scenario itself becomes an argument for taking 
  those actions" (Ogilvy, 1992). Normative scenarios span a wide spectrum, 
  according to their degree of prescriptiveness. At one end of the spectrum are 
  scenarios that are constrained in only one or a few dimensions. For example, 
  scenarios that lead to a substantial degree of climate change sometimes are 
  used as a reference for assessing the "worst case" as far as impacts 
  are concerned (e.g., scenarios that explore extreme events and tails of frequency 
  distributions).</p>
<p>At the other extreme of the spectrum are comprehensive, multidimensional normative 
  scenarios that are constructed to meet the constraints of a prescribed target 
  world. Examples are scenarios that constrain emissions within bounds ("safe 
  emissions corridors") that avoid inducing a critical climate change, defined 
  according to a subjectively selected impact criterion (Alcamo and Kreileman, 
  1996). Most of the emissions stabilization scenarios explored by the IPCC in 
  recent assessments (IPCC, 1996a; Schimel <i>et al</i>., 1997a) are founded on 
  similar premises.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="314"></a>3.1.4. What Changes are Being Considered?</h3>
<p>The types of scenarios examined in this chapter are depicted schematically 
  in <a href="#fig31">Figure 3-1</a>; they include scenarios of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Socioeconomic factors</i> (<a href="127.htm">Section 3.2</a>), which 
    are the major underlying anthropogenic cause of environmental change and have 
    a direct role in conditioning the vulnerability of societies and ecosystems 
    to climatic variations and their capacity to adapt to future changes.</li>
  <li><i>Land use and land cover</i> (<a href="132.htm">Section 3.3</a>), which 
    currently are undergoing rapid change as a result of human activities. Climate 
    change itself may induce land-use and land-cover changes, with probable feedbacks 
    to the climate system. Furthermore, future land cover may be influenced by 
    efforts to sequester carbon and offset GHG emissions into the atmosphere.</li>
  <li><i>Other environmental factors</i> (<a href="136.htm">Section 3.4</a>), 
    which is a catch-all for a range of nonclimatic changes in the natural environment 
    (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, air pollution, stratospheric ozone depletion, 
    and freshwater availability) that are projected to occur in the future and 
    could substantially modify the vulnerability of a system or activity to impacts 
    from climate change.</li>
  <li> <i>Climate</i> (<a href="142.htm">Section 3.5</a>), which is the focus 
    of the IPCC and underpins most impact assessments reported in this volume.</li>
  <li><i>Sea level</i> (<a href="148.htm">Section 3.6</a>), which generally is 
    expected to rise relative to the land (with some regional exceptions) as a 
    result of global warming-posing a threat to some low-lying coasts and islands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues that are common to all scenarios concerning scenario consistency and 
  the interactions and feedbacks between scenarios are treated in <a href="151.htm">Section 
  3.7</a>. Characterizations of future climate and related conditions during the 
  21st century, based on the new IPCC emissions scenarios, are introduced in <a href="154.htm">Section 
  3.8</a>, and the chapter closes with a brief examination of key gaps in knowledge 
  and emerging new methods of scenario development.</p>
