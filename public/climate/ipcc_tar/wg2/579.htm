<h3><a name="1527"></a>15.2.7 Public and Private Insurance Systems</h3>
<p>The North American economy is widely affected by weather conditions. The Chicago 
  Mercantile Exchange stated recently that weather affects US$2 trillion of the 
  US$9 trillion gross national product (GNP). Insurance is a critical part of 
  the vulnerability/adaptation equation because many of the economic risks and 
  impacts of weather-related events are diversified and ultimately paid through 
  insurance.<br>
</p>
<p>The discussion in the following subsections embraces public and private insurance 
  systems, as well as disaster relief. Within the private insurance sector are 
  many actors, including property/ casualty (P/C) insurers, life/health insurers, 
  reinsurers, self-insurers, and various trade allies (risk managers, brokers, 
  agents, etc.). Within the public sector are direct insurance programs, as well 
  as disaster preparedness and recovery activities. Other segments of the financial 
  services sector appear to be less vulnerable and are treated in <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="15271"></a>15.2.7.1 Private-Sector Insurance Systems </h4>
<p>Private insurance is among the largest economic sectors in North America, with 
  about 40% (US$780 billion) of global premium revenues in 1998 (Swiss Re, 1999). 
  North American premiums represent 9% of GDP, or about US$2,600 per capita. Despite 
  its size, the industry is hardly a monolith; there are numerous types of insurance 
  companies and market segments (Mills <i>et al</i>., 2001).<br>
</p>
<p>Weather-related loss data presented here are based on diverse sources, and 
  the particular costs included can vary somewhat among countries and over time. 
  In some cases, definitions set minimum thresholds for inclusion; for example, 
  because of the minimum cost threshold of US$25 million in the U.S. (formerly 
  US$5 million), no winter storms were included in the statistics from 1949-1974, 
  and few were included thereafter (Kunkel <i>et al</i>., 1999). Although large in aggregate, 
  highly diffuse losses from structural damages as a result of land subsidence 
  also would be captured rarely in these statistics. Data-gathering conventions 
  can result in omission of certain types of costs (e.g., weather-related vehicle 
  losses). Thus, the totals presented here are inherently underestimates of actual 
  losses.<br>
</p>
<p>Although North America experienced 59% of global weather-related insurance 
  losses and 36% of total economic losses during the 1985-1999 period, it experienced 
  only 20% of the events and 1% of associated mortalities (see <a href="576.htm#fig154">Figure 
  15-4</a>). Total economic losses (insured and uninsured) from weather-related 
  events represented US$253 billion (current dollars) during this period. Of that 
  total, 38% (US$96 billion) were privately insured, with considerable year-to-year 
  fluctuations in the ratio.</p>
<p>During this period, weather-related natural disasters represented 82% of total 
  natural disaster losses in the United States and virtually the entire total 
  in Canada (where significant earthquake losses have not occurred). Although 
  considerable attention is given to catastrophic losses, half of all insured 
  weather-related losses are from relatively small events (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Inflation-adjusted catastrophe losses have been growing in North America over 
  the past 3 decades (see <a href="577.htm#fig155">Figure 15-5</a>). Corresponding 
  exposures, measured as the inverse of the ratio of premium income to losses, 
  have been growing (i.e., if the ratio goes down, exposure goes up); the ratio 
  has varied by a factor of six in the United States between 1974 and 1999, and 
  by a factor of four in Canada between 1987 and 1999 (see <a href="577.htm#fig156">Figure 
  15-6</a>).</p>
<p>Although many of the upward trends in weather-related losses are consistent 
  with what would be expected under climate change (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>), efforts to disentangle socioeconomic and demographic effects from climatic 
  factors have had mixed results in the United States (Changnon <i>et al</i>., 
  1997, 2000; Karl and Knight, 1998; Pielke and Landsea, 1998; Changnon, 1999). 
  In Canada, there is a stronger sense that both factors are at work (White and 
  Etkin, 1997; Hengeveld, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p> Irrespective of climate changes, it is clear that human exposure is increasing 
  with affluence and as populations continue to move into harm's way. The 
  estimated value of insured coastal property exposure for the first tier of counties 
  along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts as of 1993 was US$3.15 trillion (IIPLR and 
  IRC, 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>Most types of weather-related events&#151;rain, hail, ice storms, tidal surges, 
  mudslides, avalanche, windstorm, drought, land subsidence, lightning, and wildfire&#151;are 
  of concern to insurers (Ross, 2000). Corresponding losses can range from property 
  damage to business interruptions and temporary housing costs as a result of 
  loss of electric power. Coastal erosion is an important consequence of sea-level 
  rise and already is responsible for a considerable and growing rate of losses 
  (Heinz Center, 2000). Insurance in North America originally focused on fire 
  peril; only since the late 1930s have insurers provided broad-based coverage 
  for weather-related events (Mills <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
