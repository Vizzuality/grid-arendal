<h4><a name="16132"></a>16.1.3.2. The Antarctic</h4>
<p>Instrumental records analyzed by Jacka and Budd (1998) and summarized in <a href="598.htm#fig164">Figure 
  16-4</a> have shown overall warming at permanently occupied stations on the 
  Antarctic continent (1959-1996) and Southern Ocean island stations (1949-1996). 
  Using two different statistical techniques, they found that the 16 Antarctic 
  stations have warmed at a mean rate of 0.9-1.2&deg;C per century, and the 22 
  Southern Ocean stations have warmed at 0.7-1.0&deg;C per century. Antarctic 
  Peninsula stations show a consistent regional rate of warming that is more than 
  twice the average for other Antarctic stations. King and Harangozo (1998) suggest 
  that this warming is associated with an increase in the northerly component 
  of the atmospheric circulation over the Peninsula and perhaps changes in sea-ice 
  extent. For Antarctic stations, warming trends are largest in winter and smallest 
  in autumn. For the Southern Ocean stations, warming trends are largest in autumn 
  and smallest in spring and summer. However, three GCMs were unable to reproduce 
  these trends (Connolley and O'Farrell, 1998).</p>
<p>Another analysis of a 21-station data set from Antarctica by Comiso (1999) 
  found a warming trend equivalent to 1.25&deg;C per century for a 45-year record 
  beginning in the 1950s but a slight cooling trend from 1979 to 1998. The slight 
  cooling trend for this later 20-year period also was confirmed via analysis 
  of surface temperatures over the whole continent, as inferred from satellite 
  data. These changes can be placed in a long-term context by comparison with 
  results from the high-accumulation ice coring sites on Law Dome, East Antarctica, 
  which show clear climate signals with sufficient resolution to identify seasonal 
  variations (van Ommen and Morgan, 1996, 1997; Curran <i>et al</i>., 1998). There 
  was a cooling period in the late 1700s and 1800s and a warming over the 19th 
  century, with greater variability and change in winter than in summer.</p>
<p>Changes in precipitation in the Antarctic are more poorly understood. Model 
  estimates from Smith <i>et al</i>. (1998a) indicate that the accumulation rate for 
  the East Antarctic ice sheet surface has increased by a rate of 1.9 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (water equivalent) over the period 1950-1991. Their estimate of sensitivity 
  is 12.5 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> per degree of warming. Examination of water-mass 
  properties of oceans shows that significant changes have occurred over the past 
  30 years. Bindoff and McDougall (2000) and Wong <i>et al</i>. (1999) point out that 
  sub-Antarctic mode water (SAMW) and Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW) have 
  become less saline and cooler, and both water masses are now deeper. These changes 
  indicate surface warming in the source region of SAMW and increased precipitation 
  in the source region of AAIW.<br>

<p>Jacka and Budd (1998) found no significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice data 
  over the satellite era (1973-1996). Although the mean trend is zero, the sector 
  from 0&deg; to 40&deg;E has a clear trend toward increased sea ice. This is 
  matched by a larger sector of decreasing extent near the Bellingshausen and 
  Amundsen Seas, from about 65&deg;W to 160&deg;W. Elsewhere, sea-ice extent trends 
  are relatively small (see <a href="598.htm#fig164">Figure 16-4</a>)&#151;a finding 
  that also is supported by Cavalieri <i>et al</i>. (1997). Analysis of whaling 
  records by de la Mare (1997) suggests that the Antarctic summer sea-ice edge 
  has moved southward by 2.8 degrees of latitude between the mid-1950s and the 
  early-1970s. This suggests a decline in the area covered by sea ice of 25%. 
  It should be noted, however, that the data used in this analysis span two distinct 
  periods, during which differing whale species were harvested. Using atmosphere-ocean 
  sea-ice models, the computations of Wu and Budd (1998) indicate that sea ice 
  was more extensive over the past century, on the annual average by 0.7-1.2 degrees 
  of latitude. It also was thicker by 7-13 cm than at present. Wu <i>et al</i>. 
  (1999) conclude that the sea-ice extent reduced by 0.4-1.8 degrees of latitude 
  over the 20th century.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="1614"></a>16.1.4. Scenarios of Future Change </h3>
<p>The IPCC commissioned a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Four 
  "marker scenarios" representing different world storylines are used 
  to estimate emissions and climate change to 2100 (IPCC, 2000). <a href="#tab161">Table 
  16-1</a> summarizes these climate projections for the polar regions. In almost 
  all cases, predicted climates are well beyond the range of variability of current 
  climate. However, these estimates cover a very large range of precipitation 
  and temperatures, so future climate remains uncertain except that it will be 
  wetter and warmer. Some of the projected increases in precipitation and temperatures 
  are larger than for any other part of the globe.<br>
</p>
<p>Models predict that land areas in the Arctic will receive substantially increased 
  snowfall in winter and that the climate will be markedly warmer. Summer could 
  be much warmer and wetter than present. The climate over the Arctic Ocean does 
  not change as dramatically, but it will become warmer and wetter by 2080. For 
  the Antarctic continent, the models tend to predict more snow in winter and 
  summer. Although temperatures are forecast to increase by 0.5&deg;C, there will 
  be little impact on melt because they will remain well below freezing, except 
  in limited coastal localities. The Southern Ocean warms least, especially in 
  summer. Precipitation increases by as much as 20%, so there will be more freshwater 
  input to the ocean surface. This chapter also refers to other climate models. 
  Some are equilibrium models for the atmosphere only; others are transient, coupled 
  atmosphere-ocean models. Some deal with aerosols and other do not. In polar 
  regions there can be large differences in predictions, depending on the model 
  chosen, although most predict large changes in climate over the next 100 years. 
  Assessments of impacts will vary, depending on the climate model chosen. This 
  should be kept in mind in assessing the impacts described in this chapter.</p>
<p>Discrepancies among climate models and problems of downscaling (Shackley <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998) mean that alternative methods of prediction that are based on 
  analysis of empirical climate data (e.g., palaeoclimatic analogs and extrapolation 
  of recent instrumental records) still have value. Anisimov and Poljakov (1999) 
  analyzed modern temperature trends over the northern hemisphere; they suggest 
  that warming in the Arctic will be most pronounced in the continental parts 
  of North America and Eurasia. The potential impacts of continued deepening of 
  the winter polar vortex would include weakening of the wind-driven Beaufort 
  Gyre. This would further reduce the extent and thickness of the Arctic pack 
  ice (McPhee <i>et al</i>., 1998) and change ocean temperatures and sea-ice boundaries 
  (Dickson <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
