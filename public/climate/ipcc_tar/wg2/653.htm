<h2>18.6. Enhancing Adaptive Capacity</h2>
<p>The adaptive capacity of a system or nation is likely to be greater when the 
  following requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The nation has a stable and prosperous economy. Regardless of biophysical 
    vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, developed and wealthy nations 
    are better prepared to bear the costs of adaptation than developing countries 
    (Goklany, 1995; Burton, 1996).</li>
  <li> There is a high degree of access to technology at various levels (i.e., 
    from local to national) and in all sectors (Burton, 1996). Moreover, openness 
    to development and utilization of new technologies for sustainable extraction, 
    use, and development of natural resources is key to strengthening adaptive 
    capacity (Goklany, 1995).</li>
  <li> The roles and responsibilities for implementation of adaptation strategies 
    are well delineated by central governments and are clearly understood at national, 
    regional, and local levels (Burton, 1996).</li>
  <li> Systems are in place for the dissemination of climate change and adaptation 
    information, nationally and regionally, and there are forums for the discussion 
    and innovation of adaptation strategies at various levels (Gupta and Hisschem&ouml;ller, 
    1997).</li>
  <li> Social institutions and arrangements governing the allocation of power 
    and access to resources within a nation, region, or community assure that 
    access to resources is equitably distributed because the presence of power 
    differentials can contribute to reduced adaptive capacity (Mustafa, 1998; 
    Handmer <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Kelly and Adger, 1999).</li>
  <li> Existing systems with high adaptive capacity are not compromised. For example, 
    in the case of traditional or indigenous societies, pursuit of western/European-style 
    development trajectories may reduce adaptive capacity by introducing greater 
    technology dependence and higher density settlement and by devaluing traditional 
    ecological knowledge and cultural values.</li>
</ol>

<h3>18.6.1. Adaptive Capacity and Sustainable Development</h3>
<p>Ability to adapt clearly depends on the state of development (Berke, 1995; 
  Munasinghe, 1998). As Ribot <i>et al.</i> (1996) illustrate, underdevelopment 
  fundamentally constrains adaptive capacity, especially because of a lack of 
  resources to hedge against extreme but expected events. The events are not surprises: 
  "It is not that the risk is unknown, not that the methods for coping do 
  not exist&#133;rather inability to cope is due to lack of&#151;or systematic 
  alienation from&#151;resources needed to guard against these events" (Ribot 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996). </p>
<p>The process of enhancing adaptive capacity is not simple; it involves "spurts 
  of growth inter-dispersed with periods of consolidation, refocusing and redirection" 
  (Holmes, 1996). Enhancement of adaptive capacity involves similar requirements 
  as promotion of sustainable development, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved access to resources (Ribot <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Kelly and Adger, 
    1999; Kates, 2000)</li>
  <li>Reduction of poverty (Berke, 1995; Eele, 1996; Karim, 1996; Kates, 2000)</li>
  <li>Lowering of inequities in resources and wealth among groups (Berke, 1995; 
    Torvanger, 1998)</li>
  <li>Improved education and information (Zhao, 1996)</li>
  <li>Improved infrastructure (Magalh&atilde;es and Glantz, 1992; Ribot <i>et 
    al.</i>, 1996)</li>
  <li>Diminished intergenerational inequities (Berke, 1995; Munasinghe, 2000)</li>
  <li>Respect for accumulated local experience (Primo, 1996)</li>
  <li>Moderate long-standing structural inequities (Magadza, 2000)</li>
  <li>Assurance that responses are comprehensive and integrative, not just technical 
    (Ribot <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Cohen <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Rayner and Malone, 
    1998; Munasinghe and Swart, 2000)</li>
  <li>Active participation by concerned parties, especially to ensure that actions 
    match local needs and resources (Berke, 1995; Ribot <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Rayner 
    and Malone, 1998; Ramakrishnan, 1999)</li>
  <li>Improved institutional capacity and efficiency (Handmer <i>et al.</i>, 1999; 
    Magadza, 2000).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because actions taken without reference to climate have the potential to affect 
  vulnerability to it, enhancement of adaptive capacity to climate change can 
  be regarded as one component of broader sustainable development initiatives 
  (Ahmad and Ahmed, 2000; Munasinghe, 2000; Robinson and Herbert, 2000). Hazards 
  associated with climate change have the potential to undermine progress with 
  sustainable development (Berke, 1995; Wang'ati, 1996). Therefore, it is 
  important for sustainable development initiatives to explicitly consider hazards 
  and risks associated with climate change (Apuuli <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>Clearly, adaptive capacity to deal with climate risks is closely related to 
  sustainable development and equity. Enhancement of adaptive capacity is fundamental 
  to sustainable development. For example, in the drought-stricken region of northeastern 
  Brazil, an assessment of past successes and failures has indicated that a comprehensive 
  sustainable development strategy is needed to increase regional and societal 
  capacity to face present and future climate variability (Magalh&atilde;es, 1996). 
  By assessing differences in vulnerability among regions and groups and by working 
  to improve the adaptive capacity of those regions and groups, planned adaptation 
  can contribute to equity considerations of sustainable development. In the context 
  of African agriculture, Downing <i>et al.</i> (1997) conclude that enhancement 
  of present resource management activities is necessary to prepare for potential 
  impacts of climate change. In Malawi, as in many other places, the UNFCCC's 
  objectives to "ensure food production is not threatened, and to enable 
  economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner" also are central 
  to the nation's development policies (Theu <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Thus, 
  progress to reducing vulnerability to climate risks is consistent with Malawi's 
  planning and development initiatives.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the considerable literature on the impacts of climate change 
  as described throughout this volume, very little attention has been devoted 
  to the interaction of adaptation to climate change with ongoing development 
  projects and programs. Because vulnerability to climate depends on the adaptive 
  capacity of a wide range of attributes, it may be unrealistic to focus on development 
  programs that deal with adaptation to climate alone (Cohen, <i>et al.</i>, 1998; 
  Rayner and Malone, 1998). Yet there is surprisingly little recognition of climate 
  hazards and risks associated with climate change in established development 
  projects and programs (Berke, 1995; Burton and Van Aalst, 1999). O'Brian 
  and Liverman (1996) show how climate change can have serious implications for 
  development projects planned or underway in Mexico, including hydroelectric 
  and irrigation initiatives. Torvanger (1998) shows how climate flexibility considerations 
  that can be built into development investments at modest incremental costs are 
  applicable regardless of the uncertainties of climate change and with immediate 
  value because of existing risks.</p>

<h3>18.6.2. Capacity Enhancement by Scale</h3>
<p>The vulnerabilities and anticipated impacts of climate change will be observed 
  at different scales and levels of society&#151;and enhancement of adaptive capacity 
  can be initiated at different social scales (Ribot <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Handmer 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). In Bangladesh, Ahmed <i>et al.</i> (1999) distinguish between four scales: 
  mega, macro, meso, and micro. Using the example of sea-level rise as a climate 
  change impact, the authors describe adaptation options at each scale. The process 
  of sea-level rise occurs at the mega-scale and is global in its effect. At the 
  macro-scale, an associated increase in surface water and groundwater has the 
  potential to similarly effect neighboring rivers and flood plains in China, 
  Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Pakistan. Adaptive capacity at this scale is a function 
  of international economic and political structures, with implications for the 
  nations' capital and technological resources and institutions. At the meso-scale, 
  different communities within Bangladesh are differentially vulnerable, depending 
  on adaptive capacity and physiographic characteristics. At this scale, location-specific 
  adaptation options would need to be considered. Finally, at a micro-scale, family 
  units and individuals would experience vulnerabilities irrespective of the origin 
  of the processes and would employ adaptations within their particular economic 
  and sociocultural constraints. </p>
<p>Because the vulnerabilities of climate change occur at various scales, successful 
  adaptation will depend on actions taken at a number of levels. Examples of initiatives 
  to enhance adaptive capacity at various scales follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At a <i>global</i> scale 
    <ul>
      <li>Greater cooperation between industrialized and developing countries 
        to align global and local priorities by improving policy/science interactions 
        and working toward greater public awareness of climate change and adaptation 
        issues (Wang'ati, 1996; Gupta and Hisschem&ouml;ller, 1997)</li>
      <li>Inclusion of global institutions for global-level adaptation, which 
        would include research and facilitation of policy, funding, and monitoring 
        at all levels (Ahmed <i>et al.</i>, 1999)</li>
      <li>Removal of barriers to international trade; it is argued that improving 
        market conditions, reducing the exploitation of marginal land, accelerating 
        the transfer of technology, and contributing to overall economic growth 
        will promote both sustainability and adaptive capacity (Goklany, 1995)</li>
      <li>Effective global economic participation. Benefits go beyond direct financial 
        gain and include technology transfers, technical and managerial skills 
        transfers, and other skills transfers associated with the "learning 
        and doing" process (Ebohon <i>et al.</i>, 1997)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At a <i>national</i> level 
    <ul>
      <li>Development of climate change policy that is specifically geared toward 
        more vulnerable sectors in the country (Mustafa, 1998), with an emphasis 
        on poverty reduction (Kelly and Adger, 1999)</li>
      <li>Establishment of broadly based monitoring and communication systems 
        (e.g., integrated drought monitoring and information system, as suggested 
        in Wilhite, 1997)</li>
      <li>Establishment of public policy that encourages and supports adaptation 
        at local or community levels and in the private sector (Burton, 1996)</li>
      <li>Pursuit of sustainable economic growth&#151;which, in turn, allows for 
        greater dedication of resources to development of adaptive technologies 
        and innovations (Goklany, 1995)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Via <i>local</i> means 
    <ul>
      <li>Establishment of social institutions and arrangements that discourage 
        concentration of power in a few hands and prevent marginalization of sections 
        of the local population (Mustafa, 1998); arrangements need to consider 
        representativeness of decisionmaking bodies and maintenance of flexibility 
        in the functioning of local institutions (Ramakrishnan, 1998)</li>
      <li>Encouragement of diversification of income sources (and therefore risk-spreading), 
        particularly for poorer sectors of society (Wang'ati, 1996; Adger 
        and Kelly, 1999)</li>
      <li>Encouragement of formal or informal arrangements for collective security 
        (Kelly and Adger, 1999)</li>
      <li>Identification and prioritization of local adaptation measures and provision 
        of feedback to higher levels of government. These efforts would have to 
        be reinforced by the adequate provision of knowledge, technology, policy, 
        and financial support (Ahmed <i>et al.</i>, 1999).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
