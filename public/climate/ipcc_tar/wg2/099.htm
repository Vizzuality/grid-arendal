<h4>2.5.4.2. The Value of Information</h4>
<p>A straightforward method of judging the value of information in an uncertain 
  environment has been developed and applied (see Manne and Richels, 1992, for 
  an early and careful description). The idea is simply to compute the expected 
  cost of uncertainty with and without the information and compare the outcomes. 
  For example, it might be that improved information about the range of uncertainty 
  might change the mean and the variance of associated costs. If the researcher 
  were interested only in the resulting change in costs, however, the value of 
  information would simply be the difference between expected cost with and without 
  the new information, and only the mean would matter. If the same researcher 
  wanted to represent the value of information in terms of welfare that displays 
  some degree of risk aversion so that variance also plays a role, however, a 
  comparison of insurance-based estimates of the WTP to avoid uncertainty would 
  be more appropriate. </p>
<h4><a name="2543"></a>2.5.4.3. Uncertainty and Discounting</h4>
<p>Uncertainty about costs and/or values that are incurred or enjoyed over time 
  can be handled in two ways. One method calculates the present value across the 
  full range of possibilities; means and distributions of present values are the 
  result. The second method, reported in Arrow <i>et al</i>. (1996), converts 
  outcomes at each point in time into their certainty equivalents and then applies 
  discounting techniques. This approach raises the possibility of including risk 
  aversion into the calculation according to the foregoing definition.</p>
<p>The story is quite different when uncertainty surrounds selection of the discount 
  rate itself. It may not be appropriate, in these sorts of cases, to use a certainty-equivalent 
  discount rate (or an average over the range of possible rates). Weitzman (1998) 
  has noted, in particular, that the "lowest possible" discount rate 
  should be used for discounting the far-distant future. The reason, quite simply, 
  is that the expected value of present value over a range of discount rates is 
  not equal to the present value calculated with an average rate. Moreover, the 
  difference between the two is exaggerated in the distant future. Present values 
  computed with low rates, in fact, can dominate those computed with high rates 
  by orders of magnitude when the future is extended; thus, their contribution 
  to the expected value must be recognized explicitly in the selection of a discount 
  rate.</p>
