<h4>11.1.2.2. Trends and Variability in Key Climate Variables </h4>
<h4><a name="111221"></a>11.1.2.2.1. Surface air temperature</h4>
<p>Climate differs widely within Asia. In boreal Asia, the climate generally is 
  humid and cool; it is classified as continental type. Permafrost covers as much 
  as 90% of boreal Asia. An average annual mean increase in surface air temperature 
  of about 2.9&deg;C in the past 100 years has been observed in boreal Asia. Warming 
  was more pronounced during the period 1951-1995 in all of boreal Asia region 
  except for the coast of the Arctic Ocean and Chukotka (Rankova, 1998). The mean 
  surface air temperature increase is most pronounced in the winter, at a rate 
  of approximately 4.4&deg;C over the past 100 years (Gruza et al., 1997). Summer 
  temperatures in central Siberia have exhibited decreasing trends, however. </p>
<p>The climate of arid and semi-arid Asia is the warm temperate type, with hot 
  and wet or dry summers. The highest value of DTR (on the order of 20&deg;C) 
  is experienced in this region. A mean maximum temperature of &gt;45&deg;C in 
  July is not uncommon in some parts of arid Asia. In most of the Middle East, 
  the long time series of surface air temperature shows a warming trend. An increasing 
  tendency in spatially averaged seasonal and annual air temperatures has been 
  observed in Kazakhstan over the past century. Maximal warming has occurred in 
  spring. The mean annual surface temperature has risen by about 1.3&deg;C during 
  1894-1997 (Pilifosova et al., 1997); in the arid regions of China, air 
  temperature has obviously increased since the 1970s (Chen, 1995). In Pakistan, 
  annual mean surface temperature has a consistent rising trend since the beginning 
  of 20th century (Chaudhari, 1994).</p>
<p>In temperate Asia, the average annual mean surface temperature in Mongolia 
  has increased by approximately 0.7&deg;C over the past 50 years; consequently, 
  noticeable changes have taken place in the length of the cold and warm seasons 
  (Khuldorj et al., 1998). Surface temperature in northeast China has increased 
  in winter but decreased in summer since 1905 (Ren and Zhou, 1994; Ren, 1998); 
  observations also reveal a 1-2&deg;C decrease in temperature in some parts 
  of southeastern China. In Japan, the surface air temperature has shown a warming 
  trend during the past century (Yoshino, 1998a; Japan Meteorological Agency, 
  1999). </p>
<p>Tropical Asia has a unique climatological distinction because of the pervasive 
  influence of the monsoon. In tropical Asia, climate uniformity is differentiated 
  by three factors: latitude, relief, and continentality. The entire tropical 
  Asia region stretches over 38&deg; in latitude, so the differences resulting 
  from this factor are pronounced. In spite of some differences, the climates 
  of countries have one factor in common: The Asian monsoon modulates them all 
  to a large extent. For countries near the Equator, only small seasonal variations 
  occur, although most countries in this region experience clearly marked cold 
  and warm seasons. The spatial range of temperature in this region is significantly 
  large during winter. Extreme temperatures of over 45&deg;C occur over the northwest 
  part of the region during May-June. Several countries in this region have reported 
  increasing surface temperature trends in recent decades. In Vietnam, annual 
  mean surface temperature has increased over the period 1895-1996, with 
  mean warming estimated at 0.32&deg;C over the past 3 decades. Annual mean surface 
  air temperature anomalies over Sri Lanka during the period 1869-1993 suggest 
  a conspicuous and gradually increasing trend of about 0.30&deg;C per 100 years 
  (Rupakumar and Patil, 1996). The warming trend over India has been reported 
  to be about 0.57&deg;C per 100 years (Rupakumar et al., 1994).</p>
