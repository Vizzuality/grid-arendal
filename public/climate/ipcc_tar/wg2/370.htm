<h2>9.11. Adaptation Options</h2>
<p>Adaptation measures can be used effectively to greatly reduce many of the potential 
  health impacts of climate change (Gubler, 1998d; McMichael and Kovats, 2000; 
  WHO, 2000). The most important, cost-effective, and urgently needed measure 
  is to rebuild public health infrastructure. In very many countries of the world, 
  this infrastructure has declined in recent years. Many diseases and public health 
  problems that otherwise may be exacerbated by climate change could be prevented 
  substantially or completely with adequate financial and public health resources. 
  These resources would encompass public health training programs, research to 
  develop and implement more effective surveillance and emergency response systems, 
  and sustainable prevention and control programs.</p>
<p>Understanding vulnerability to changes in ranges or rates of diseases is the 
  first step in addressing adaptive capacity. Adaptation involves the ability 
  to change behavior or health infrastructure to reduce these potential negative 
  impacts or increase potential positive impacts of climate change. Interventions 
  early in the causal chain of disease are preferred (e.g., "primary" 
  prevention to remove or reduce risks before any human cases occur). To the extent 
  that this is not always feasible (or the risk factors unknown), "secondary 
  prevention" or surveillance for early warning to prevent any further cases 
  also is important.<br>
</p>
<p>Adaptation is a function of several societal systems, including access to financial 
  resources (for individuals and populations), technical knowledge, public health 
  infrastructure, and the capacity of the health care system. Note that there 
  is much similarity in the determinants of adaptive capacity and those of vulnerability 
  (see <a href="352.htm">Section 9.3</a>). Adaptation can occur via two routes: 
  autonomous adaptation, which is the natural or spontaneous response to climate 
  change by affected individuals, and purposeful adaptation, which is composed 
  of planned responses to projected climate change&#151;typically by governmental 
  or other institutional organizations (MacIver and Klein, 1999). Purposeful adaptation 
  also can occur via deliberate modification of personal, family, and community 
  lifestyles, particularly in response to public education programs. Anticipatory 
  adaptations are planned responses that take place in advance of climate change. 
  <br>
</p>
<p> Adaptation to the impacts of climate change may occur at the population, community, 
  or personal level (see <a href="368.htm#tab94">Table 9-4</a>). The capacity 
  to adapt to potential changes in the climate will depend on many factors, including 
  improving the current level of public health infrastructure; ensuring active 
  surveillance for important diseases; and continuing research to further our 
  understanding of associations between weather, extreme events, and vector-borne 
  diseases. In addition, continuing research into medical advances required for 
  disease prevention, control, and treatment&#151;such as vaccines, methods to 
  deal with drug-resistant strains of infectious agent, and mosquito control&#151;is 
  needed. More generally, research is needed to identify adaptation needs, evaluate 
  adaptation measures, assess their environmental and health implications, and 
  set priorities for adaptation strategies. The following subsections outline 
  adaptive measures that have been developed for two areas of climate change impacts 
  on health.</p>
<h3><a name="9111"></a>9.11.1. Extreme Events and Natural Disasters</h3>
<p>Major impacts on human health may occur via changes in the magnitude and frequency 
  of extreme events (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a> and <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 9</a>). Following Hurricanes George and Mitch, 
  a range of policies to reduce the impacts of such extreme events has been identified 
  (PAHO, 1999):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Undertaking vulnerability studies of existing water supply and sanitation 
    systems and ensuring that new systems are built to reduce vulnerability</li>
  <li>Developing improved training programs and information systems for national 
    programs and international cooperation on emergency management<br>
  </li>
  <li>Developing and testing early warning systems that should be coordinated 
    by a single national agency and involve vulnerable communities providing and 
    evaluating mental health care, particularly for those who may be particularly 
    vulnerable to the adverse psychosocial effects of disasters (e.g., children, 
    the elderly, and the bereaved).</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related mortality in vulnerable cities 
  around the world include weather-based early warning systems (WMO, 1997; Ortiz 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). A different system must be developed for each city, based on 
  that city's specific meteorology. Specific weather/health thresholds are 
  determined and used to call health warnings or advisories. Many systems are 
  based on synoptic methodology; specific "offensive" air masses are 
  identified and forecasts are developed to determine if they will intrude into 
  a city within the next 60 hours. Two systems are under construction for Rome, 
  Italy, and Shanghai (WMO, 1997). </p>
<p>Institutional and cultural barriers to the use of seasonal forecast information 
  remain. Decisionmakers should be educated or encouraged to use scientific information 
  that may lead to reduction in losses from natural disasters (Pfaff <i>et al</i>., 
  1999).</p>
