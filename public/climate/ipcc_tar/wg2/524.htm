<h4>14.1.2.2. Future: Climate Scenarios </h4>
<p>Climate modeling has proven to be extremely useful in building projections 
  for climate change and scenarios of future climate under different forcings. 
  General circulation models have demonstrated their ability to simulate realistically 
  the large-scale features of observed climate; hence, they are widely used to 
  assess the impact that increased loading of the atmosphere with greenhouse and 
  other gases might have on the climate system. Although there are differences 
  among models with regard to the way they represent the climate system processes, 
  all of them yield comparable results on a global basis. However, they have difficulty 
  in reproducing regional climate patterns, and large discrepancies exist among 
  models. In several regions of the world, distributions of surface variables 
  such as temperature and rainfall often are influenced by the local effects of 
  topography and other thermal contrasts, and the coarse spatial resolution of 
  GCMs cannot resolve these effects. Consequently, large-scale GCM scenarios should 
  not be used directly for impact studies, especially at the regional and local 
  levels (von Storch, 1994); downscaling techniques are required (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/373.htm">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="../wg1/474.htm">13</a>).</p>
<p>At the large scale, rates of mean annual temperature changes in the Latin American 
  region for the next century are projected to be 0.2-2&deg;C (Carter and 
  Hulme, 2000) under the low-emissions scenario (B1) produced as part of the IPCC 
  <i>Special Report on Emission Scenarios </i>(SRES). The warming rate could range 
  between 2 and 6&deg;C for the higher emissions case (A2). Most GCMs produce 
  similar projections for temperature changes on a global basis; projected changes 
  in precipitation remain highly uncertain.</p>
<p>For impact studies, it is crucial to have a projection of concurrent changes 
  of temperature and precipitation at the regional scale. Various scenarios of 
  climate change for Latin America have been put forward on the basis of GCM projections 
  under the IS92a scenario. Most of these regional scenarios are based on GCM 
  experiments that are downscaled through statistical techniques. Derived climate 
  change scenarios for Mexico suggest that climate in Mexico will be drier and 
  warmer (Perez, 1997). Several hydrological regions in Mexico are highly vulnerable 
  to decreased precipitation and higher temperatures (Mendoza <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  A regional climate change scenario for central Argentina in response to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  doubling under the IS92 scenario for the year 2050, also obtained through a 
  statistical downscaling approach, shows a smaller increase in minimum temperature 
  as compared to the maximum and larger increases for summer than for winter months, 
  which generates enhanced temperature amplitudes (Solman and Nu&ntilde;ez, 1999). 
  In addition, a decrease in precipitation is projected over the region, which 
  is larger for summer (12%) than for winter months (5%). This result highlights 
  an important consequence in the rainfall regime over the region: A large decrease 
  in rainfall projected for the rainy season will seriously affect soil moisture, 
  hence agricultural production in the region. </p>
<p>Several climate change scenarios for other parts of Latin America rely on linear 
  interpolation of GCM output to estimate increases in surface temperature and 
  precipitation (Mata, 1996; Carril <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Hofstadter and Bidegain, 
  1997, Paz Rada <i>et al</i>., 1997; Centella <i>et al.</i>, 1998; MARENA, 2000). 
  In the case of Costa Rica (MINAE-IMN, 2000), under the IS92a scenario for the 
  year 2100, the results show a small increase in precipitation for the southeastern 
  Caribbean region and an important decrease&#151;close to 25%&#151;in the northwestern 
  Pacific region. This latter region already experiences water problems as a result 
  of El Ni&ntilde;o and an increasing demand from infrastructure for tourism and 
  irrigation. Under the same climate scenario, mean temperature in Costa Rica 
  is expected to rise by more than 3&deg;C by 2100, and tendencies in actual climate 
  series (1957-1997) show already an increase of 0.4&deg;C every 10 years 
  for the more continental Central Valley areas. This last estimation may reflect 
  signals other than the one related to climate change.</p>
<p>Results from climate scenarios for Nicaragua imply an additional pressure on 
  productivity sectors and human activities. Under the IS92a emissions scenario, 
  mean temperature for the Pacific watershed would be expected to rise, ranging 
  from 0.9 for the year 2010 to 3.7&deg;C for the year 2100, and precipitation 
  would decrease by 8.4% for the year 2010 and 36.6% for the year 2100. For the 
  Caribbean watershed, mean temperature would increase, ranging from 0.8&deg;C 
  for the year 2010 to 3.3&deg;C for the year 2100, and precipitation would decrease 
  in a range between 8.2% for the year 2010 and 35.7% for the year 2100 (MARENA, 
  2000). </p>
<p>Potential effects of climate change in Brazil suggest changes of 4-4.5&deg;C 
  in surface temperature as a result of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  (de Siqueira <i>et al.</i>, 1994, 1999). Central and south-central Brazil may 
  experience increases of 10-15% in autumn rainfall; reductions could appear 
  during December, with high risk of drought during summer, affecting crops (see

<p>Analysis of climate variations during the instrumental period and evidence 
  suggested by paleoclimatic and other proxy climate information suggests that 
  climate variations and change have been found in several regions in Latin America. 
  Most climate records cover the past century; at this time scale, there have 
  been indications of multidecadal and interannual variability, some linked to 
  extremes of the Southern Oscillation. The lack of continuous and long-term records 
  from the past does not allow one to identify climate patterns with a high degree 
  of confidence to determine whether these climates were similar to or much different 
  from that of present times&#151;particularly with respect to the frequency and 
  intensity of extreme events such as drought, floods, freezes, heat waves, and 
  especially hurricanes and tropical storms. However, multidecadal variations 
  have been identified in rainfall and streamflow records in the region, although 
  no clear unidirectional trend indicators of climate change have been identified.</p>
