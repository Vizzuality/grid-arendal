<h3>8.4.3. The Role of UNEP Financial Services Initiatives in the Climate Change 
  Debate </h3>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has brokered statements of 
  environmental commitment by banks and insurance companies that have been endorsed 
  by many of the major players in these industries. These statements have now 
  been signed by almost 300 banks and insurance companies from all parts of the 
  world (most from Europe and Asia) (UNEP, 2000). By signing the statement, companies 
  undertake to make every effort to incorporate environmental considerations into 
  their internal and external processes (UNEP, 1995; Schanzenb&auml;cher, 1997). 
  Measures implemented by signatories range from reduction of energy consumption 
  of buildings under their management to incorporation of environmental issues 
  in credit business and risk management considerations. One might think that 
  financial services is a clean industry with very little direct impact on climate 
  change, but insurance companies in particular own huge physical assets (e.g., 
  ~500 million ft2 of building space in the United States alone, which corresponds 
  to an energy bill of US$750 million a year) (Mills and Knoepfel, 1997).</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 8-3. Capital Market Alternatives for Risk Financing 
        </b> </div>
      <p>Alternative catastrophe risk financing mechanisms through weather derivatives 
        have begun to emerge and are regarded by some observers as playing a role 
        in the continued viability of the insurance sector. Other authors suggest 
        that these instruments will continue to be a niche product because of 
        inability to come up with adequate pricing for these mechanisms as offered 
        through the capital markets. Such products also raise the awareness and 
        visibility of natural disasters and climate change issues within the financial 
        markets (Swiss Re, 1996; Credit Suisse Group, 1998; Lester, 1999; Mahoney, 
        1999; Punter, 1999).</p>
      <p><i>Contingent Capital Securities.</i> The two types of capital contingency 
        securities available to investors are contingent surplus notes and catastrophe 
        equity puts. Investors in these securities become&#151;at the insurer's 
        option&#151;creditors of or equity investors in the insurer. The exercised 
        "notes" and "puts" are shown as surplus on an insurer's 
        balances sheet and thus increase assets without an offsetting increase 
        in the liability portion of the balance sheet. The insurer can draw from 
        surplus to pay unreserved catastrophe losses and have the funds (surplus) 
        necessary to take on new exposures.</p>
      <p><i>Catastrophe Risk Securities.</i> Two forms of "cat risk securities" 
        are available that transfer underwriting risk to investors: catastrophe 
        bonds and catastrophe insurance options. Primary insurers and reinsurers 
        can make use of these securities. Both benefit insurers by making monies 
        available to offset catastrophe losses. In contrast to contingent capital 
        securities, these instruments do not bolster an insurer's surplus; 
        they provide funds for the payment of losses. They are reflected as both 
        an asset and as a liability on the insurer's financial statements.</p>
      <p>These approaches are relatively new, and their efficacy and robustness 
        must be evaluated (see Tol, 1998; Peara, 1999; Swiss Re, 1999b; Bantwal 
        and Kunreuther, 2000; GAO, 2000a; Nutter, 2000; Jamison, 2000; Mills et 
        al., 2001). Among the questions to address include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a more competitive environment, would insurers and reinsurers be 
          inclined to participate in or encourage (subsidize) risk-reduction measures?</li>
        <li>Do derivatives signal a potential means by which self-insurers can 
          expand their capacity, thereby providing greater competition for primary 
          insurers and reinsurers?</li>
        <li>Will the occurrence(s) of catastrophic weather-related events turn 
          away investors after an event?</li>
        <li>Do existing catastrophe and climate modeling techniques yield information 
          necessary to adequately evaluate financial risks and thus the prices 
          of these derivatives? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of 11 major trends in investing, catastrophe bonds were rated by members 
        of the International Securities Market Association as least likely to 
        have significant impacts on securities markets in the future (Freeman, 
        2000).</p>
      <p>Despite doubts about these new instruments, banks and insurance companies 
        consider this a growing business. In 1999, the cumulative volume of weather-related 
        bonds/derivatives reached US$3 billion. It can be assumed that an increasing 
        number of such instruments will be available to hedge against climate 
        risks. This, in turn, will allow banks to get the "insurance" 
        coverage they need for their lending activities (Nicholls, 2000).</p>
