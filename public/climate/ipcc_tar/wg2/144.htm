<h3>3.5.3. Baseline Climatologies </h3>
<h4><a name="3531"></a>3.5.3.1. Baseline Period </h4>
<p>Any climate scenario must adopt a reference baseline period from which to calculate 
  changes in climate. This baseline data set serves to characterize the sensitivity 
  of the exposure unit to present-day climate and usually serves as the base on 
  which data sets that represent climate change are constructed. Among the possible 
  criteria for selecting the baseline period (IPCC, 1994), it should be representative 
  of the present-day or recent average climate in the study region and of a sufficient 
  duration to encompass a range of climatic variations, including several significant 
  weather anomalies (e.g., severe droughts or cool seasons).</p>
<p>A popular climatological baseline period is a 30-year "normal" period, 
  as defined by the WMO. The current WMO normal period is 1961-1990, which 
  provides a standard reference for many impact studies. Note, however, that in 
  some regions, observations during this time period may exhibit anthropogenic 
  climate changes relative to earlier periods.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="3532"></a>3.5.3.2. Sources and Characteristics of Data </h4>
<p>Sources of baseline data include a wide variety of observed data, reanalysis 
  data (a combination of observed and model-simulated data), control runs of GCM 
  simulations, and time series generated by stochastic weather generators. Different 
  impact assessments require different types and resolutions of baseline climatological 
  data. These can range from globally gridded baseline data sets at a monthly 
  time scale to single-site data at a daily or hourly time scale. The variables 
  most often required are temperature and precipitation, but incident solar radiation, 
  relative humidity, windspeed, and even more exotic variables sometimes may be 
  needed. </p>
<p>Two important issues in the development of baseline data sets are their spatial 
  and temporal resolution and uncertainties related to their accuracy (New, 1999) 
  (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/483.htm#1332">Section 13.3.2</a> for 
  further details). Evaluation of the differences between baseline data sets recently 
  has become an important step in scenario development because these differences 
  can have an important bearing on the results obtained in an impact assessment 
  (Arnell, 1995; Pan <i>et al</i>., 1996).<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="354"></a>3.5.4. Construction of Scenarios </h3>
<p>Techniques for constructing climate scenarios (i.e., scenario information that 
  is directly usable in impact studies) have evolved very slowly during the past 
  2 decades. However, in the past few years several new developments in climate 
  modeling and scenario development have expanded the array of techniques for 
  scenario formation. The following subsections discuss some of these issues and 
  present some background illustrative material. </p>
<h4><a name="3541"></a>3.5.4.1. Choosing Variables of Interest</h4>
<p>In principle, GCM-based scenarios can be constructed for a wide range of variables 
  at time resolutions down to subdaily time steps. In practice, however, not all 
  data are available at the desired temporal and spatial resolutions. Most scenarios 
  are conventionally based on changes in monthly mean climate, although with greater 
  quantities of model output now being saved operationally, daily output and information 
  on certain types of extreme events (e.g., mid-latitude cyclone intensities) 
  can be accessed readily. However, consideration must be given to whether model 
  output regarding a particular phenomenon is deemed "meaningful." For 
  example, although information on changes in the frequency and intensity of El 
  Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events may be desirable from an impacts 
  point of view, analyses of possible future changes in this oscillation still 
  are very preliminary (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>). </p>
<h4><a name="3542"></a>3.5.4.2. Selecting GCM Outputs</h4>
<p>Many equilibrium and transient climate change experiments have been performed 
  with GCMs (Kattenberg <i>et al</i>., 1996; <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>). Several research centers now serve as repositories of GCM information 
  (see, e.g., Hulme <i>et al</i>., 1995; CSIRO, 1997). The IPCC Data Distribution 
  Centre (IPCC-DDC, 1999) complements these existing sources. <a href="143.htm#tab35">Table 
  3-5</a> lists GCM experiments that have been used to develop scenarios for impacts 
  studies evaluated in this report.</p>
<p>Four criteria for selecting GCM outputs from such a large sample of experiments 
  are suggested by Smith and Hulme (1998):</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Vintage</i>: Recent model simulations are likely (though by no means 
    certain) to be more reliable than those of an earlier vintage since they are 
    based on recent knowledge and incorporate more processes and feedbacks.</li>
  <li><i>Resolution</i>: In general, increased spatial resolution of models has 
    led to better representation of climate.</li>
  <li><i>Validation</i>: Selection of GCMs that simulate the present-day climate 
    most faithfully is preferred, on the premise that these GCMs are more likely 
    (though not guaranteed) to yield a reliable representation of future climate.</li>
  <li><i>Representativeness of results</i>: Alternative GCMs can display large 
    differences in estimates of regional climate change, especially for variables 
    such as precipitation. One option is to choose models that show a range of 
    changes in a key variable in the study region.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
