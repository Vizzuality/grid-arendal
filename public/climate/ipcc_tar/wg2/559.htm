<h4><a name="152212"></a>15.2.2.1.2. Wholesale changes in forest structure and function</h4>
<p>If climate change results in wholesale replacement of one forest community 
  with another, effects on ecosystem functions ranging from carbon storage to 
  wildlife habitat could be dramatic (Tilman, 1998). Possible wholesale changes 
  in forest structure have been a great source of uncertainty and concern. The 
  North America assessment in the IPCC's Special Report on Regional Impacts 
  of Climate Change concluded that there were equal probabilities of considerable 
  forest dieback and enhanced forest growth, given state-of-the-art models and 
  GCM predictions (Shriner and Street, 1998).</p>
<p>Many types of models (biogeographic individual-based forest growth, gap, dynamic 
  global vegetation, regression tree analysis, response surface, richness, and 
  rare and endangered species) have been used with numerous climate scenarios 
  to examine broad-scale climate change-induced changes in vegetation (VEMAP Members, 
  1995; Shugart and Smith, 1996; Aber <i>et al</i>., 2001). There is great uncertainty 
  about the precision and accuracy of each of these models and the assumptions 
  that underlie them (Loehle and LeBlanc, 1996; Repo <i>et al</i>., 1996; Beuker <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Many studies suggest that all major forest types in North America will 
  expand northward and most will increase in extent in the next 50-100 years. 
  The increase in forests is predicted to be driven by slight warming coupled 
  with increases in water-use efficiency (WUE) associated with increased atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> (Saxe <i>et al</i>., 1998). However, with continued warming, increased 
  water use associated with higher temperatures overwhelms the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  effect, resulting in potentially important decreases in forest area (Aber <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
<p>Wholesale changes in forest ecosystem structure over time are likely to be 
  mediated by changes in disturbance regimes and/or catastrophic events that provide 
  opportunities for forest regeneration over large areas (Suffling, 1995; Loehle 
  and LeBlanc, 1996). Of particular interest in North America are changes in fire 
  and insect outbreaks.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="152213"></a>15.2.2.1.3. Fire </h4>
<p>Stocks <i>et al</i>. (1998) used outputs from four GCMs to project forest fire 
  danger levels in Canada under a warmer climate. Their analysis shows an earlier 
  start to the fire season and significant increases in the area experiencing 
  high to extreme fire danger. Increased lightning frequency associated with global 
  warming also may increase fire frequency (Goldammer and Price, 1998). Changes 
  in fire frequency have a wide range of effects, from production of tropospheric 
  aerosols that influence climate (Clark <i>et al</i>., 1996) to changes in ecosystem 
  carbon storage and trace gas fluxes. The long-term effects of fire will depend 
  heavily on changes in human fire management activities, which are uncertain&#151;especially 
  in remote boreal forests, where fire is a critical issue (e.g., see <a href="587.htm">Section 
  15.3.2.8</a>). In mid-latitudes, climate effects on fire frequency are much 
  less important than human management factors (Veblen <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="152214"></a>15.2.2.1.4. Insects</h4>
<p>Insects represent dominating disturbance factors (Hall and Moody, 1994) in 
  North America's forests; during outbreaks, trees often are killed over 
  vast areas (Hardy <i>et al</i>., 1986; Candau <i>et al</i>., 1998). Because the potential 
  for wildfire often increases in stands after insect attack (Stocks, 1987; Wein, 
  1990), uncertainties in future insect damage patterns also lead to uncertainties 
  in fire regimes. Insect outbreaks also lead to changes in ecosystem carbon and 
  nutrient cycling, biomass decomposition, energy flow (Mattson and Addy, 1975; 
  Schowalter <i>et al</i>., 1986; Szujecki, 1987; Haukioja <i>et al</i>., 1988; Chapin, 1993; 
  Haack and Byler, 1993), and competitive relationships between plants (Morris, 
  1963; Holling, 1992)&#151;hence successional pathways, species composition, 
  and forest distribution.<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change already appears to be accelerating the seasonal development 
  of some insects (Fleming and Tatchell, 1994). Forecasts based on historical 
  relationships between outbreak patterns and climate in specific areas are likely 
  to predict change as the climate in those areas changes. Such analyses suggest 
  more frequent [mountain pine beetle (Thomson and Shrimpton, 1984), spruce budworm 
  (Mattson and Haack, 1987), eastern hemlock looper (Carroll <i>et al</i>., 1995), jack 
  pine budworm (Volney and McCullough, 1994), western spruce budworm (Thomson 
  <i>et al</i>., 1984)] or longer [forest tent caterpillar (Roland <i>et al</i>., 1998), spruce 
  budworm (Cerezke and Volney, 1995)] outbreaks or range shifts northward and 
  to higher elevations [spruce budworm (Williams and Liebhold, 1997)] as climate 
  change progresses.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="152215"></a>15.2.2.1.5. Vegetation In human settlements </h4>
<p>Vegetation in human settlements plays two potentially important roles that 
  are relevant to climate change: modification of local climate and sequestration 
  of carbon.<br>
</p>
<p>Trees reduce demands for seasonal heating and cooling of the interiors of buildings 
  and absorb air pollutants (Heisler, 1986; Nowak <i>et al</i>., 1994). In the city of 
  Chicago, calculations suggest that increasing tree cover by 10% could reduce 
  building energy use by 5-10% (Nowak <i>et al</i>., 1994). Thus, urban tree planting 
  represents an adaptive strategy that can reduce energy use and associated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions and counteract temperature increases in urban areas, which are predicted 
  to be extreme in some cases.<br>
</p>
<p>Carbon density in residential areas can be significant, amenable to management, 
  and often overlooked in evaluation of landscape, regional, and national carbon 
  budgets. Freedman <i>et al</i>. (1996) found that aboveground tree biomass of 
  an old residential neighborhood in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was only slightly smaller 
  than that of a natural forest in a nearby reserve. Nowak <i>et al</i>. (1994) 
  estimated that carbon storage by urban forests in the United States was 440-990 
  Mt. There is a strong need for better estimates of "natural" carbon 
  fluxes in human-dominated environments.</p>
