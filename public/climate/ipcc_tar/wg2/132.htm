<h2>3.3. Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Scenarios </h2>
<h3><a name="331"></a>3.3.1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The land cover of the Earth has a central role in many important biophysical 
  and socioeconomic processes of global environmental change. Contemporary land 
  cover is changed mostly by human use; therefore, understanding of land-use change 
  is essential in understanding land-cover change (Turner <i>et al</i>., 1995). 
  Land use is defined through its purpose and is characterized by management practices 
  such as logging, ranching, and cropping. Land cover is the actual manifestation 
  of land use (i.e., forest, grassland, cropland) (IPCC, 2000). Land-use change 
  and land-cover change (LUC-LCC) involve several processes that are central to 
  the estimation of climate change and its impacts (Turner <i>et al</i>., 1995). 
  First, LUC-LCC influences carbon fluxes and GHG emissions (Houghton, 1995; Braswell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). This directly alters atmospheric composition and radiative 
  forcing properties. Second, LUC-LCC changes land-surface characteristics and, 
  indirectly, climatic processes (Bonan, 1997; Claussen, 1997). Third, LUC-LCC 
  is an important factor in determining the vulnerability of ecosystems and landscapes 
  to environmental change (Peters and Lovejoy, 1992). LCC, for example&#151;through 
  nitrogen addition, drainage and irrigation, and deforestation (Skole and Tucker, 
  1993; Vitousek <i>et al</i>., 1997)&#151;may alter the properties and possible 
  responses of ecosystems. Finally, several options and strategies for mitigating 
  GHG emissions involve land cover and changed land-use practices (IPCC, 1996b).</p>
<p>The central role of LUC-LCC highlights the importance of its inclusion in scenario 
  development for assessing global change impacts. To date this has not been done 
  satisfactorily in most assessments (Leemans <i>et al</i>., 1996a). For instance, 
  in earlier emission scenarios (e.g., Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992), constant 
  emission factors were applied to define land use-related methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) 
  and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions. Furthermore, linear extrapolations 
  of observed deforestation rates were assumed, along with an averaged carbon 
  content in deforested areas. The SRES scenarios (Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 
  2000) have improved on the underlying LUC-LCC assumptions, considerably enhancing 
  scenario consistency. Unfortunately, these SRES scenarios provide highly aggregate 
  regional LUC-LCC information, which is difficult to use in impact assessments. 
  A comprehensive treatment of the other roles of LUC-LCC in the climate system 
  is still deficient. To highlight these shortcomings, this section reviews studies 
  and approaches in which LUC-LCC information is applied to develop scenarios 
  for both impact and mitigation assessment.</p>
<h3><a name="332"></a>3.3.2. Methods of Scenario Development</h3>
<h4><a name="3321"></a>3.3.2.1. Baseline Data</h4>
<p>The SAR evaluated land-use and land-cover data sets and concluded that they 
  often were of dubious quality (Leemans <i>et al</i>., 1996a). Since the SAR, 
  many statistical data sources have been upgraded and their internal consistency 
  improved (e.g., FAO, 1999), although large regional differences in quality and 
  coverage remain. In addition, the high-resolution global database, DISCover, 
  has become available (Loveland and Belward, 1997). This database is derived 
  from satellite data and consists of useful land-cover classes. Furthermore, 
  attempts also have been made to develop historical land-use and land-cover databases 
  (Ramankutty and Foley, 1999; Klein Goldewijk, 2001). These databases use proxy 
  sources&#151;such as historic maps, population-density estimates, and infrastructure&#151;to 
  approximate land-cover patterns. All of these improvements to the information 
  base are important for initializing and validating the models used in scenario 
  development for global change assessments.</p>
<h4><a name="3322"></a>3.3.2.2. Regional and Sector-Specific Approaches</h4>
<p>A large variety of LUC-LCC scenarios have been constructed. Many of them focus 
  on local and regional issues; only a few are global in scope. Most LUC-LCC scenarios, 
  however, are developed not to assess GHG emissions, carbon fluxes, and climate 
  change and impacts but to evaluate the environmental consequences of different 
  agrosystems (e.g., Koruba <i>et al</i>., 1996), agricultural policies (e.g., 
  Moxey <i>et al</i>., 1995), and food security (e.g., Penning de Vries <i>et 
  al</i>., 1997) or to project future agricultural production, trade, and food 
  availability (e.g., Alexandratos, 1995; Rosegrant <i>et al</i>., 1995). Moreover, 
  changes in land-cover patterns are poorly defined in these studies. At best 
  they specify aggregated amounts of arable land and pastures.</p>
<p>One of the more comprehensive attempts to define the consequences of agricultural 
  policies on landscapes was the "Ground for Choices" study (Van Latesteijn, 
  1995). This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of increasing agricultural 
  productivity and the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe and analyzed the possibilities 
  for sustainable management of resources. It concluded that the total amount 
  of agricultural land and employment would continue to decline&#151;the direction 
  of this trend apparently little influenced by agricultural policy. Many different 
  possibilities for improving agricultural production were identified, leaving 
  room for development of effective measures to preserve biodiversity, for example. 
  This study included many of the desired physical, ecological, socioeconomic, 
  and regional characteristics required for comprehensive LUC-LCC scenario development 
  but did not consider environmental change.</p>
<p>Different LUC-LCC scenario studies apply very different methods. Most of them 
  are based on scenarios from regression or process-based models. In the global 
  agricultural land-use study of Alexandratos (1995), such models are combined 
  with expert judgment, whereby regional and disciplinary experts reviewed all 
  model-based scenarios. If these scenarios were deemed inconsistent with known 
  trends or likely developments, they were modified until a satisfactory solution 
  emerged for all regions. This approach led to a single consensus scenario of 
  likely agricultural trends to 2010. Such a short time horizon is appropriate 
  for expert panels; available evidence suggests that expert reviews of longer 
  term scenarios tend to be conservative, underestimating emerging developments 
  (Rabbinge and van Oijen, 1997).</p>
