<h3><a name="1626"></a>16.2.6. Arctic Hydrology</h3>
<p>The hydrological regime of the Arctic is particularly susceptible to predicted 
  climate change because of the dominance of the thermally sensitive cryosphere 
  and its controlling influence on the water cycle. Virtually all major hydrological 
  processes and related aquatic ecosystems are affected by snow and ice processes, 
  including the major Arctic rivers. Although these rivers originate in more temperate 
  southern latitudes, they pass through cold regions before reaching the Arctic 
  Ocean. Changes in precipitation also have great potential for modifying the 
  hydrology and sediment load in rivers, which could affect aquatic life (Michel 
  and van Everdingen, 1994).</p>
<h4><a name="16261"></a>16.2.6.1. Changes in Precipitation, Snow Accumulation, 
  and Spring Melt </h4>
<p>Almost all climate models forecast increases in precipitation; but estimates 
  vary widely and are complicated by many other factors, such as clouds (Stewart, 
  2000). Combined changes in temperature and precipitation will produce changes 
  in the pattern of snow storage and, ultimately, Arctic hydrology. Warmer conditions 
  generally will reduce the length of winter. Seasonal snow accumulation could 
  increase in higher elevation zones, especially above the freezing level, where 
  there would be little summer melt. Increased summer storminess will reduce melt 
  at intermediate elevations as a result of increased cloud and summer snowfall, 
  so many existing semi-permanent snowpacks will continue to exist (Woo, 1996). 
  At lower elevations, particularly in the more temperate maritime zones, rainfall 
  and rain-on-snow melt events probably will increase. <br>
</p>
<p>An earlier transition from winter to spring will mean that snowmelt will be 
  more protracted, with less intense runoff. This will be accentuated where increased 
  active-layer thickness and loss of permafrost increases the water storage capacity 
  of the ground, leading to a decrease in runoff. Summer base flow will increase. 
  Overall, this means that there will be less seasonal fluctuation in runoff through 
  the year (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16262"></a>16.2.6.2. Surface Water Budgets and Wetlands </h4>
<p>Predicted climate change will lead to greater evaporation and transpiration. 
  Transpiration should increase as nontranspiring lichens and mosses that currently 
  dominate the tundra regions are replaced by a denser cover of vascular plants 
  (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997). These changes are likely to reduce the amount of ponded 
  water and runoff. The unglaciated lowlands of many Arctic islands, where special 
  ecological niches occur, are likely to be especially sensitive. For coastal 
  areas, changes to local micro-climates may occur because longer open-water seasons 
  in the adjacent sea will lead to more frequent fog and low clouds, as well as 
  reduced incident solar radiation. These changes may limit the expected increase 
  in evaporation and transpiration (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997).<br>
</p>
<p>The ability of Arctic wetlands to act as a source or sink of organic carbon 
  and CH<sub>4</sub> depends on the position of the water. Analysis of subarctic 
  sedge fens to increases in temperature of 4&deg;C suggests reduced water storage 
  of 10-20 cm over the summer in northern peatlands, even with a small increase 
  in precipitation (Rouse, 1998). This is significant, given that Moore and Roulet 
  (1993) suggest that a reduction of 0.1 m in water storage in northern forested 
  peatland is sufficient to convert these areas from a source to a sink of atmospheric 
  CH<sub>4</sub>. Wider questions concerning the carbon budget, including the 
  level of uncertainty, are discussed in TAR WGI Chapter 3. Further predictions 
  based on 2xCO<sub>2</sub> changes indicate a 200-300 km retreat of the 
  southern boundary of peatlands in Canada toward the Arctic coast and significant 
  changes in their structure (Gignac and Vitt, 1994). Degradation of permafrost, 
  which currently forms an impermeable layer, will couple many ponds with the 
  groundwater system and lead to their eventual drainage. Areas of special sensitivity 
  include patchy Arctic wetlands on continuous permafrost and those along the 
  southern limit of permafrost (Woo and Young, 1998). In contrast, warming of 
  surface permafrost also could lead to formation of new wetlands, ponds, and 
  drainage networks through the process of thermokarst development, especially 
  in areas with high concentrations of ground ice.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16263"></a>16.2.6.3. Ecological Impact of Changing Runoff Regimes 
</h4>
<p>A warmer climate will create a more pluvial runoff regime as a greater proportion 
  of the annual precipitation is delivered by rain rather than snow and a flattening 
  of the seasonal runoff cycle occurs. Enhancement of winter flow will mean streams 
  that currently freeze to their beds will retain a layer of water beneath the 
  ice. This will be beneficial to invertebrates and fish populations. However, 
  such rivers will then be prone to ice jamming and hence larger annual flood 
  peaks. Warming will lead to a shortened ice season and thinner ice cover. For 
  large northward-flowing rivers, this could reduce the severity of ice jamming 
  in spring, especially if the magnitude of the peak snowmelt that drives breakup 
  also is reduced (Beltaos and Prowse, 2000). Decreased ice-jam flooding will 
  benefit many northern communities located near river floodplains. In contrast, 
  reductions in the frequency and severity of ice-jam flooding would have a serious 
  impact on northern riparian ecosystems, particularly the highly productive river 
  deltas, where periodic flooding has been shown to be critical to the survival 
  of adjacent lakes and ponds (Marsh and Hey, 1989; Prowse and Conly, 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Decreases in winter snowpack and subsequent spring runoff from upstream tributaries 
  has led to reduced frequency and severity of ice jams affecting the very large 
  Peace-Athabasca Delta (Prowse <i>et al</i>., 1996). These changes are analogous 
  to those expected with predicted climate warming. Ice breakup is a major control 
  over aquatic ecology, affecting numerous physical and biochemical processes 
  and the biodiversity and productivity of such northern rivers (Prowse, 1994; 
  Scrimgeour <i>et al</i>., 1994). Major adjustments in their ecology are expected 
  in the future. A similar situation exists for northern ponds and lakes, where 
  ice cover will be thinner, form later, and break up earlier&#151;with consequent 
  limnological changes. Total primary production should increase in all Arctic 
  lakes and ponds with an extended and warmer ice-free season (Douglas <i>et al</i>., 
  1994). Primary productivity of Arctic aquatic systems also should be boosted 
  by a greater supply of organic matter and nutrients draining from a more biologically 
  productive terrestrial landscape (Schindler, 1997; Hobbie <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  Thinner ice cover will increase the solar radiation penetrating to the underlying 
  water, thereby increasing photosythnetic production of oxygen and reducing the 
  potential for winter fish kills. However, a longer ice-free season will increase 
  the depth of mixing and lead to lower oxygen concentrations and increased stress 
  on coldwater organisms (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
