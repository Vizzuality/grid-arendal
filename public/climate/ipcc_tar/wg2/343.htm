<h3>8.5.4. Vulnerability and Financial Adaptation in Developing Countries</h3>
<p>Spreading the risks of catastrophes presents special difficulties in developing 
  countries, particularly rural areas. In general, there is very limited use of 
  commercial insurance because of long histories of economic instability, fluctuating 
  and prohibitive insurance costs as related to agricultural prices, lack of enforcement 
  of building codes and land-use regulations, subjective evaluation of risk by 
  consumers ("it won't happen to me"), and non-monitored economies. 
  In some developing countries, government-organized crop and disaster insurance 
  exists on paper, but with large debt loads and weak economies, many such programs 
  are inactive. In many cases, governments are unable to respond to public expectations.</p>
<p>A World Bank/UN Development Programme (UNDP) workshop reports that disaster 
  mitigation is evolving from the phases of relief and contingency planning, technical 
  preparedness, and structural solutions to a phase in which there is a greater 
  emphasis on reducing social and economic vulnerabilities and investing in long-term 
  mitigation activities. However, formal sector mechanisms may completely bypass 
  the poorest households. Therefore, the need to develop informal and flexible 
  financial instruments such as microfinance for disaster mitigation has become 
  extremely important (World Bank, 2000).</p>
<p>Although targeted microfinance programs have been able to meet the financial 
  needs of individual households, the same attributes of microfinance also could 
  be applied to deal with natural disaster reduction. There is a potential for 
  microfinance to provide explicit and implicit insurance to households (World 
  Bank, 2000). However, limitations of microfinance as a risk-reduction mechanism 
  arise from issues of moral hazard (see <a href="334.htm">Section 8.3.4</a>), 
  inadequate monitoring of credit programs after large spatial shocks, and reduction 
  in informal insurance arrangements provided by social networks. There also is 
  the possibility of governments committing much less to relief programs in the 
  wake of a disaster if affected communities are served by microfinance institutions. 
  Small microfinance programs without access to reinsurance may collapse in a 
  natural disaster. For nationwide disasters, even the largest microfinance programs 
  may require international arrangements (World Bank, 2000).</p>
<p>Several microfinance organizations in Bangladesh have been seriously affected 
  by the floods in 1998 in terms of maintaining savings mobilization, credit repayment, 
  and cash availability. Larger microfinance organizations with greater capitalization 
  and preparedness cope better with disasters than small microfinance organizations, 
  many of which get completely wiped out. There is now a recognition of the need 
  for providing a financial cushion for the unexpected. It could be provided through 
  a Central Reserve Fund/Emergency Fund and bigger microfinance organizations 
  such as Grameen Bank setting aside part of their funds to meet the contingencies 
  of natural disasters (World Bank, 2000).</p>
