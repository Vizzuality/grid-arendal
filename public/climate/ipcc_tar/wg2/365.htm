<h3>9.7.9. Rodent-Borne Diseases </h3>
<p>Rodent-borne diseases are zoonoses that are transmitted directly to humans 
  by contact with rodent urine, feces, or other body fluids (Mills and Childs, 
  1998; Peters, 1998). Rodents are principle hosts for arthropod vectors such 
  as fleas (see <a href="363.htm#977">Section 9.7.7</a>) and ticks (see <a href="363.htm#978">Section 
  9.7.8</a>). Environmental factors that affect rodent population dynamics include 
  unusually high rainfall, drought, and successful introduction of exotic plant 
  species. Rodent-borne pathogens are affected indirectly by ecological determinants 
  of food sources that affect rodent population size (Williams <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Engelthaler <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="9791"></a>9.7.9.1. Leptospirosis</h4>
<p>Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease caused by the bacteria Leptospira. 
  It probably is the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world and is particularly 
  common in the tropics (PAHO, 1998). Infection is caused by exposure to water, 
  damp soil, or vegetation contaminated with the urine of infected wild and domestic 
  animals (e.g., rodents and dogs) (Thiermann, 1980). Outbreaks often occur after 
  heavy rainfall and during floods (Kriz <i>et al</i>., 1998; Trevejo <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Therefore, any increase in flooding associated with climate change may 
  affect the incidence of this disease.</p>
<h4><a name="9792"></a>9.7.9.2. Hantaviruses</h4>
<p>Several hantaviruses are capable of causing severe, often fatal, illness in 
  humans (PAHO, 1998). Each has a specific geographic distribution that is determined 
  by that of the primary rodent host (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). Humans are 
  infected by aerosol exposure to infectious excreta or occasionally by bites. 
  The better known of these diseases are hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, 
  caused by Hantaan virus, in China and Korea and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 
  in the Americas, caused by several viruses that are specific to their rodent 
  host (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). Outbreaks of disease may be associated with 
  weather that promotes rapid increases in rodent populations, which may vary 
  greatly between seasons and from year to year (Glass <i>et al</i>., 2000). Many 
  hantavirus infections occur in persons of lower socioeconomic status, where 
  poorer housing and agricultural activities favor closer contact between humans 
  and rodents (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). Arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, 
  etc.), which are ecologically similar to hantaviruses, may respond similarly 
  (Mills and Childs, 1998). </p>
<h3><a name="9710"></a>9.7.10. Water-Related Infectious Diseases</h3>
<p>There are complex relationships between human health and problems of water 
  quality, availability, sanitation, and hygiene. Predicting the potential impacts 
  of climate change on water-related diseases therefore is difficult because access 
  to a clean safe water supply is determined primarily by socioeconomic factors. 
  Extreme weather&#151;floods or droughts&#151;can increase the risk of disease 
  via contamination of water resources, poor hygiene, or other mechanisms. Currently, 
  the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 1 billion people 
  worldwide are without access to safe drinking water and that every year as many 
  as 4 million die prematurely because they do not have access to safe drinking 
  water and sanitation. Increases in water stress are projected under climate 
  change in certain countries (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>), but it is 
  difficult to translate such indicators directly into the attributable risk for 
  water-related diseases. Water scarcity may necessitate use of poorer quality 
  sources of freshwater, such as rivers, which often are contaminated. Decreases 
  in water supplies could reduce the water available for drinking and washing 
  and lower the efficiency of local sewerage systems, leading to increased concentration 
  of pathogenic organisms in raw water supplies.</p>
<p>Excessive precipitation can transport terrestrial microbiological agents into 
  drinking-water sources. For example, some outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, giardia, 
  and other infections have been triggered by heavy rainfall events in the UK 
  and United States (Lisle and Rose, 1995; Atherholt <i>et al</i>., 1998; Rose <i>et al</i>., 
  2000; Curriero <i>et al</i>., 2001). Significant correlation between the cumulative 
  monthly distribution of cholera cases and the monthly distribution of precipitation 
  has been observed in Guam (Borroto and Haddock, 1998). In many countries, handling 
  of sewage is not separate from the drainage system for stormwaters. It is important 
  that water resource management can adapt to changes in the frequency of precipitation 
  extremes to minimize the risk of microbiological contamination of the public 
  water supply. <br>
</p>
<p>Cholera is a water- and food-borne disease and has a complex mode of transmission. 
  In tropical areas, cases are reported year-round. In temperate areas, cases 
  are reported mainly in the warmest season. The seventh cholera pandemic currently 
  is spreading across Asia, Africa, and South America. A new serogroup (V. cholerae 
  O139) appeared in 1992 and is responsible for large epidemics in Asia. During 
  the 1997-1998 El Ni&ntilde;o, excessive flooding caused cholera epidemics in 
  Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique (WHO, 1998b). Birmingham 
  <i>et al</i>. (1997) found a significant association between bathing and drinking 
  water from Lake Tanganyika and the risk of infection with cholera. Warming in 
  the African Great Lakes may cause conditions that increase the risk of cholera 
  transmission in the surrounding countries (WHO, 1998b). See <a href="367.htm">Section 
  9.8</a> for a discussion of cholera in coastal waters.</p>
