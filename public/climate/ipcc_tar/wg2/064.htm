<h3>1.5.2. Socioeconomic Uncertainties </h3>
<p>An often overlooked source of uncertainty in assessments of impacts and vulnerability 
  is the wide difference in assumptions (often not even stated) in the initial 
  conditions and trends of environmental systems and socioeconomic conditions. 
  These assumptions include information on population and related variables (e.g., 
  population density), economic trends (e.g., income levels, sectoral composition 
  of GDP, or levels of trade), other social indicators (e.g., education levels, 
  private- and public-sector institutions), culture, land cover and use, and availability 
  and use of other resources such as water. They are important not only for determining 
  the forces driving global changes but also for understanding the general capabilities 
  available to societies for adaptation. Projections of these factors for time 
  periods such as the middle of the 21st century are at least as uncertain as 
  projections of future climate; hence, it is probably most advisable to use such 
  information as scenarios of change, or conditioning assumptions (IPCC, 1998). 
  Moreover, culture exerts important influences on socioeconomic processes, problemsolving 
  methods, and the like. The formation of coalitions, social movements, and educational 
  programs directed toward changing institutional norms that might influence people's 
  behavior concerning climatic change is culturally determined, like other complex 
  social and psychological processes. Cultural processes and economic behavior, 
  for example, can be modeled to capture some of the complexity of the social 
  processes, structures, and cognitive behavior involving culture (e.g., Rotmans 
  and van Asselt, 1996; Koizumi and Lundstedt, 1998). Thus, it is simply impossible 
  to predict with high confidence how societies and economies will develop in 
  the future-hence the extent to which they will have the capacity needed for 
  adaptation. The use of scenarios to assess driving forces and adaptive capacity 
  is one way to explicitly acknowledge these kinds of structural uncertainties 
  (e.g., IPCC, 2000). Socioeconomic scenarios, as already noted, are not predictions 
  of future states of the world but consistent and plausible sets of assumptions 
  about issues such as population growth, economic development, values, and institutions. 
</p>
<p>Although the emphasis on adaptation to reduce vulnerability and take advantage 
  of emerging opportunities is increasing in impact assessment, many uncertainties 
  remain regarding the effectiveness of different options, the relationship between 
  adaptation to short-term climate fluctuations and long-term climate change, 
  and constraints and opportunities that will be imposed by factors such as existing 
  institutional structures, economic and financial limitations, and cultural resistance 
  (IPCC, 1998). </p>
<h3><a name="153"></a>1.5.3. Risk and Uncertainty </h3>
<p>Uncertainties are pervasive throughout climate change impact assessment. For 
  some sectors, such as agriculture, uncertainty is large enough to prevent a 
  highly confident assessment of even the sign of the impacts. Until a few years 
  ago, uncertainties in assessments were so great that few researchers were willing 
  to carry their analysis through to numerical estimates of monetary impacts. 
  Even today, as the applicability of subjective probabilities is becoming more 
  accepted, impact estimates with explicit confidence intervals are the exception 
  rather than the rule (a few exceptions are Peck and Teisberg, 1992; Hope et 
  al., 1993; Nordhaus, 1994a; Manne and Richels, 1995; Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 
  1996; Titus and Narayanan, 1996; Roughgarden and Schneider, 1999). <a href="108.htm#fig22">Figure 
  2-2</a> (Moss and Schneider, 2000) graphically depicts how uncertainties in 
  emissions scenarios feed into uncertainties in carbon cycle response, climate 
  sensitivity, regional climate responses, and ranges of impacts in an "explosion" 
  or "cascade" of widening uncertainty bounds. However, despite this daunting 
  expansion of uncertainty, methods to classify and formally treat such uncertainties 
  via subjective probability distributions are available in the literature (see 
  <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a> and <a href="103.htm">Section 2.6</a>) and 
  can help to clarify which subcomponents of the overall human-environment system 
  are most critical to integrated assessments of the costs and benefits of climatic 
  changes or climate policies. </p>
<h3><a name="154"></a>1.5.4. Low-Probability Catastrophic Events </h3>
<p>Efforts to deal with low-probability, potentially catastrophic events in integrated 
  assessments of climate change are not well-represented in the literature. One 
  possibility would be to treat these risks like any hazard and use methods from 
  risk analysis: The value of the risk is the probability of occurrence multiplied 
  by the consequences of the event. For rare and catastrophic possibilities, there 
  is very little frequency data; thus, probabilities assessed are based largely 
  on subjective methods (e.g., Nordhaus, 1994b; Roughgarden and Schneider, 1999). 
  Equally important, under these conditions the expected cost estimate would be 
  very sensitive to the analyst's (subjective) assumptions about the costs of 
  catastrophic events. Subjective probabilities can vary widely from analyst to 
  analyst under such conditions. This partly explains why most analysts have been 
  reluctant to include low-probability but potentially catastrophic events in 
  integrated assessments (for a recent exception, see Mastrandrea and Schneider, 
  2001). However, absence of analysis does not necessarily imply absence of risk, 
  and many risk management decisions in the private and public sectors are based 
  on strategic hedging against low-probability but highly costly possibilities, 
  such as insurance and deterrence (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). However, 
  the expected cost approach would imply a risk neutrality-an uncomfortable position 
  for those holding risk averse values in the face of possibilities such as collapse 
  of the "conveyor belt" circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Broecker, 
  1997; Rahmstorf, 1999; <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>) or melting of the West 
  Antarctic Ice Sheet (e.g., Oppenheimer, 1998). Risk-averse individuals often 
  worry about the possibility that a forecast for a high-consequence event is 
  either accurate or an underestimate-the "type 2 error." Such individuals have 
  argued that a better way to treat the possibility of catastrophe is to ensure 
  that all possible efforts are taken to avoid it-the "precautionary principle" 
  (see, e.g., Wiener, 1995). However, spending valuable, limited resources to 
  hedge against possible catastrophic outcomes with a low probability of occurring 
  is infeasible in practice; scarce resources could have been used more productively 
  elsewhere, including dealing with more probable climatic threats. People who 
  are concerned about "squandering" resources on what they perceive to be unlikely 
  threats or even an erroneous forecast-the "type 1 error"-often are engaged in 
  contentious debates with those more concerned with type 2 errors-a situation 
  that is well-known in risk management disciplines. Thus, it is difficult to 
  apply the precautionary principle unambiguously to justify a hedging strategy 
  against a potential catastrophic climatic event without also applying it to 
  the possibility of negative outcomes from the hedging strategy itself, then 
  weighing the relative risks of type 1 versus type 2 errors (Wiener, 1995). </p>
<h3><a name="155"></a>1.5.5. Valuation Methods-Monetary Measures or Multiple Numeraires 
</h3>
<p>Although much progress on valuation techniques is being made, as noted in <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 
  1-2</a>, uncertainties are still large, and many impact estimates are "highly 
  speculative" (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). Impacts can be divided into market 
  and nonmarket impacts. </p>
<p>Market impacts occur in sectors or activities such as agriculture, forestry, 
  provision of water, insurance against extreme events, transportation, tourism, 
  and activities that use low-lying coastal land. Where these activities produce 
  marketed goods, a monetary estimate of impacts (in units of dollars per °C, 
  for example) sometimes can be made with fairly straightforward techniques, at 
  least under present-day conditions; this has been the most common approach in 
  impact studies to date (e.g., Mendelsohn et al., 2000). Market prices, adjusted 
  to correct for market distortions (e.g., externalities), are the appropriate 
  measure for unit impacts. Although the techniques are well established, the 
  numbers obtained still are approximate as a result of all the uncertainties 
  that surround impact assessments. Working out how the impacts will unfold in 
  the distant future is much less straightforward. Impacts could increase as the 
  intensity and scale of the activity increases (e.g., loss of coastal property) 
  or decrease as more modern and robust systems replace existing ones (e.g., new 
  crop strains are introduced with more climatic adaptability). Also, as noted 
  in <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a>, impacts expressed in economic terms 
  embed the values people attribute to the impacts across several numeraires, 
  as well as the values of future generations (see <a href="102.htm">Section 2.5.6</a> 
  for further elaborations). </p>
<p>For example, the use of highly aggregated decision analysis frameworks (see 
  <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</a> and <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>) 
  can be controversial because aggregation of positive and negative costs of even 
  a limited number of market category sectors involves the arithmetic sum of many 
  subelements that contain large uncertainties and are related to different regions. 
  Furthermore, important market costs could be incurred by political instability 
  (e.g., Kennedy et al., 1998), migration of displaced persons (e.g., Myers, 1993), 
  diminished capacity of damaged ecosystems to provide accustomed services (e.g., 
  Daily, 1997), or loss of heritage sites from sea-level rise (e.g., Schneider 
  et al., 2000b). Moreover, losses in nonmonetary categories (i.e., other numeraires 
  such as biodiversity lost, lives lost, quality of life degraded, or inequity 
  generated-all per °C) are very controversial (e.g., Goulder and Kennedy, 1997, 
  discuss attempts to estimate the intrinsic value of species). Any aggregation 
  over such numeraires into a common metric-usually the dollar-cannot be accomplished 
  transparently unless a variety of assumptions are explicitly given for the valuation 
  of each of these numeraires before aggregation hides the underlying assumptions 
  of how valuation was accomplished.</p>
<h3><a name="156"></a>1.5.6. Damage Aggregation and Distributional Effects </h3>
<p>Aggregation of various damages into a single estimate sometimes is appropriate 
  to provide policymakers with information about the magnitude of damages that 
  can be expected on a global scale. However, as noted in <a href="055.htm#box12">Box 
  1-2</a>, <a href="#155">Section 1.5.5</a>, and <a href="108.htm">Section 2.6.4</a>, 
  there also is the risk that such aggregation conceals rather than highlights 
  some of the critical issues and value-laden assumptions that are at stake. </p>
<p>As a hypothetical but concrete example, assume that climatic change would cause 
  destruction of lives, ecosystems, and property in Bangladesh, corresponding 
  to a loss of 80% of its GDP. This loss to Bangladesh would amount to roughly 
  0.1% of global GDP. If the global economy grows at 2% yr<sup>-1</sup>, this 
  assumed impact on Bangladesh would correspond to a delay in global income growth 
  of less than 3 weeks. It is debatable whether adding, say, the possible benefits 
  for temperate agriculture to the losses of lives resulting from sea-level rise 
  in Bangladesh helps to assess the severity of climate change impacts because 
  the "winner" does not compensate the "loser" (i.e., benefits for temperate agriculture 
  offer little relief to those who have been affected by sea-level rise in other 
  regions). Authors in the literature have expressed concern about trading the 
  costs of emission reduction in some countries (e.g., more efficient end-use 
  energy technologies) with large-scale losses of lives and human health in others 
  (e.g., Munasinghe, 2000). Still, this is implicitly done in most conventional 
  cost-benefit analyses of climate change available in the literature. As noted 
  above and in <a href="108.htm">Section 2.6.4</a>, this points to the necessity 
  of using appropriately disaggregated cost and benefit data to make the analysis 
  more transparent. Possible ways of incorporating equity concerns include use 
  of distributional weights in cost-benefit analysis (e.g., Azar and Sterner, 
  1996; Fankhauser et al., 1997; Azar, 1999). </p>
<p>Owing to the complexities of valuation and aggregation analyses described above 
  and in the preceding subsection, the TAR authors are cautious about the applicability 
  of single "optimal" answers. Instead, they attempt to examine ranges of outcomes 
  calculated under a variety of assumptions available in the literature, for which 
  alternative valuation methods can be applied to different categories across 
  various numeraires. </p>
