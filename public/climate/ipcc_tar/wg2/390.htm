<h4>10.2.2.3. Crop Production</h4>
<p>Major impacts on food production will come from changes in temperature, moisture 
  levels, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and pests and diseases. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment increases photosynthetic rates and water-use efficiency 
  (WUE) (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). The direct effects are largest 
  on crops with C<sub>3</sub> photosynthetic pathway (wheat, rice, and soybean) 
  compared with C<sub>4</sub> crops (maize, sorghum, millet, and sugarcane). Increases 
  in local temperatures may cause expansion of production into higher elevations. 
  The grain filling period may be reduced as higher temperatures accelerate development, 
  but high temperatures may have detrimental effects on sensitive development 
  stages such as flowering, thereby reducing grain yield and quality. Crop water 
  balances may be affected through changes in precipitation and other climatic 
  elements, increased evapotranspiration, and increased WUE resulting from elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Specific examples of impacts on crops are available. Pimentel (1993) notes 
  that global warming is likely to alter production of rice, wheat, corn, beans, 
  and potatoes&#151;staples for millions of people and major food crops in Africa. 
  Staple crops such as wheat and corn that are associated with subtropical latitudes 
  may suffer a drop in yield as a result of increased temperature, and rice may 
  disappear because of higher temperatures in the tropics (Odingo, 1990).</p>

<p><a name="fig108"></a>The possible impact of climate change on maize production 
  in Zimbabwe was evaluated by simulating crop production under climate change 
  scenarios generated by GCMs (Muchena and Iglesias, 1995). Temperature increases 
  of 2 or 4&deg;C reduced maize yields at all sites; yields also decreased under 
  GCM climate change scenarios, even when the beneficial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  were included. It is suggested that major changes in farming systems can compensate 
  for some yield decreases under climate change, but additional fertilizer, seed 
  supplies, and irrigation will involve an extra cost. The semi-extensive farming 
  zone was particularly sensitive to simulated changes in climate, and farmers 
  in this zone would be further marginalized if risk increases as projected.</p>
<p>Analysis of potential impacts, using dynamic simulation and geographic databases, 
  has been demonstrated for South Africa and the southern Africa region by Schulze 
  et al. (1993) (see also Schulze <i>et al., </i>1995; Hulme, 1996; Schulze, 2000). 
  Relatively homogenous climate and soil zones were used to run agrohydrological, 
  primary productivity, and crop yield models. The results reaffirm the dependence 
  of production and crop yield on intraseasonal and interannual variation of rainfall. 
</p>
<p>Impacts on crops need to be integrated with potential changes in the agricultural 
  economy. Yates and Strzepek (1998) describe an integrated analysis for Egypt 
  (see <a href="#fig108">Figure 10-8</a>). Their model is linked to a dynamic 
  global food trade model, which is used to update the Egyptian sector model and 
  includes socioeconomic trends and world market prices of agricultural goods. 
  Impacts of climatic change on water resources, crop yields, and land resources 
  are used as inputs into the economic model. The climate change scenarios generally 
  had minor impacts on aggregated economic welfare (sum of consumer and producer 
  surplus); the largest reduction was approximately 6%. In some climate change 
  scenarios, economic welfare slightly improved or remained unchanged. Despite 
  increased water availability and only moderate yield declines, several climate 
  change scenarios showed producers being negatively affected by climate change. 
  The analysis supports the hypothesis that smaller food-importing countries are 
  at risk of adverse climate change, and impacts could have as much to do with 
  changes in world markets as with changes in local and regional biophysical systems 
  and shifts in the national agricultural economy. </p>
