<h3>4.6.4. Factors Affecting Adaptive Capacity</h3>
<p>From the beginning of human attempts to shape the water environment to human 
  benefit, water management has dealt with the variability of the native supply 
  of water and the variability of demands for the use of water (Stakhiv, 1998). 
  Great strides have been made in dealing with even extreme water regimes&#151;particulary 
  droughts&#151;through interventions on the supply and demand sides (e.g., Stern 
  and Easterling, 1999). Drought management planning is playing an increasing 
  role in many water management agencies, lowering their susceptibility to drought 
  impacts. Thus, in some ways the prospects of a change in the resource base&#151;perhaps 
  characterized by lower mean supplies and higher variability&#151;represent only 
  a sharpening of traditional challenges to water management. There are three 
  important differences, however. First, future climate change is highly uncertain 
  at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to water management: All we 
  know is that the future may not necessarily be like the recent past. Second, 
  as noted above, the potential pervasiveness of these changes across large regions 
  presents challenges that preclude some traditional steps of adaptation and requires 
  innovative approaches that go beyond experience to date. Third, climate-induced 
  effects may be nonlinear, carrying potential for surprises beyond those incorporated 
  in traditional water management.</p>
<p>The ability to adapt to climate variability and climate change is affected 
  by a range of institutional, technological, and cultural features at the international, 
  national, regional, and local levels, in addition to specific dimensions of 
  the change being experienced. Among the most important features are the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The capacity of water-related institutions, consisting of water agencies&#146; 
    authority to act, skilled personnel, the capability and authority to consider 
    a wide range of alternatives (including but not limited to supply-side and 
    demand-side interventions) in adapting to changed conditions, the capability 
    and authority to use multi-objective planning and evaluation procedures in 
    the assessment of policy alternatives, procedures for conflict resolution, 
    and incentives to undertake serious ex post analysis of policies and projects 
    to learn what has really worked (OECD, 1985). For example, O&#146;Connor et 
    al. (1999) found in the Susquehanna River Basin, USA, that experienced full-time 
    water managers are more likely to consider future scenarios in their planning 
    than part-time managers.</li>
  <li>The legal framework for water administration that always constrains, for 
    better and for worse, the options that are open to water management. Naturally, 
    laws change as needs change, but the changes are slow and greatly lag changing 
    needs. In many countries, the legal framework for water management is moving 
    toward increasing environmental protection (e.g., the European Union&#146;s 
    habitats directive). Such a direction poses further constraints on options 
    to address climate change, but if the move reflects an increasing concern 
    with sustainable water management (however defined), opportunities for considering 
    adaptation to climate change are increased.</li>
  <li>The wealth of nations in terms of natural resources and ecosystems, human-made 
    capital (especially in the form of water control systems), and human capital 
    (including trained personnel) that determines what nations can &#147;afford 
    to commit&#148; to adaptation. This should include the ability and willingness 
    to transfer wealth among population groups and regions within a country and 
    among nations. This is the major constraint on adaptation to climate change 
    in poorer countries.</li>
  <li>The state of technology and the framework for the dissemination (or monopolization) 
    of technology, especially in the fields of bioengineering of drought- and 
    salt-resistant varieties of plants and techniques for the desalination of 
    seawater.</li>
  <li>Mobility of human populations to change residential and work locations in 
    response to severe climate events or climate change. This is a major factor 
    in coastal and island areas. Mobility is severely hampered by population pressures, 
    especially in tropical island settings.</li>
  <li>The speed of climate change is crucial in determining the capabilities of 
    societies to adapt and change water management practices. Speed of change 
    and the cumulative extent of change affect the impacts on society in nonlinear 
    fashions (Howe et al., 1990; National Research Council, 1992).</li>
  <li>The complexity of management arrangements also may be a factor in response. 
    In principle, the fewer agencies involved in water management, the easier 
    it will be to implement an adaptation strategy (although the structure within 
    the agencies will be very important). If there are many stakeholders to involve&#151;perhaps 
    with conflicting requirements, management goals, and perceptions and each 
    with some management control over part of the water system&#151;it may be 
    more difficult to adapt to changing circumstances. There is evidence that 
    in some mature infrastructure systems, there may be substantial oportunities 
    for increasing the resilience of water resource systems through institutional 
    changes as well (Hansler and Major, 1999).</li>
  <li>The ability of water managers to assess current resources and project future 
    resources. This requires continuing collection of data and the ability to 
    use scenarios with hydrological models to estimate possible future conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether adaptation takes place or not may be heavily influenced by the occurrence 
  of extreme events. Such events often are catalysts for change in management 
  and may serve two roles. First, they may expose failings in the current water 
  management system. Second, they may raise the perception among decision makers 
  of the possibility of climate change&#151;even if they cannot be attributed 
  directly to climate change.<br>
  <br>
  Recent experience with extreme events (e.g., the Chinese floods of 1998, the 
  Rhine floods of 1996 and 1997, the eastern European floods of 1997 and 1998, 
  and the Mozambique floods of 2000) shows that many societies are extremely exposed 
  to loss and damage during extreme events, especially floods. At first, it may 
  appear that this implies that existing adaptive techniques, as widely used by 
  water managers, are not working as expected to minimize risk and loss (some 
  loss will always be inevitable because no flood protection scheme can provide 
  complete protection): Adaptation is not working. However, there is extensive 
  evidence that social vulnerability to extreme events is serious and increasing 
  (Munasinghe and Clark, 1995; Hewitt, 1997; Tobin and Montz, 1997; Haughton, 
  1998; La Red, 1999; Mileti, 1999) and that this exposure to hazards has been 
  significantly increased by public and private development with insufficient 
  regard for known hazards (Hewitt, 1997; Marsden, 1997; Pulwarty and Riebsame, 
  1997). In the United States there was more damage from hurricanes between 1990 
  and 1995 than there was between 1970 and 1990, after adjustments for inflation 
  (Pielke, 1997), even though both periods had low hurricane frequency (Landsea 
  et al., 1996). Changnon et al. (1997) analyzed the dramatic increase in dollar 
  losses of insured property in the United States, which reached US$840 billion 
  in the 1990&#150;1994 period, and conclude that changes in weather and climate 
  were not primary causes. Detailed meteorological analyses came to the same conclusion 
  for flooding losses (Changnon, 1998; Karl and Knight, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  Thus, societies&#146; failure to adapt to extreme events in the broadest sense 
  (i.e., by &#147;allowing&#148; risk-prone development) appears to have been 
  largely responsible for increased damages, and that failure has not improved 
  with time (Changnon and Changnon, 1998; Pielke and Landsea, 1998; Kunkel et 
  al. 1999). It also appears that political decisions may have produced maladaptive 
  results (Wiener, 1996; Hewitt, 1997; Mileti, 1999). In the United States, insurance 
  has been a leading instrument for hazard awareness and post-event recovery. 
  After 30 years of promotion, education, and subsidized premiums, only 20% of 
  residents in floodplains were insured by the late 1990s (LeCompte and Gahagan, 
  1998; Pasterick, 1998). These failures to take advantage of insurance suggest 
  that even wealthy societies adapt poorly to foreseeable hazards.<br>
  <br>
  The residual damages of hazard events also are inequitably distributed across 
  populations. This was shown clearly by studies of Hurricane Andrew in Florida 
  (Peacock et al., 1997), leading the director of the Pan American Health Organization 
  to state that &#147;those who lost the most had the least to lose&#148; (PAHO, 
  1999). Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998, exhibiting the extreme 
  vulnerability of that region (La Red, 1999; UNICEF, 1999). Among the responsible 
  factors were lack of land-use planning, deforestation, and inappropriate consumption 
  and production systems (Hewitt, 1997; Mileti, 1999; PAHO, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  Thus, available evidence concerning the effectiveness of adaptation to meteorological 
  and geologic hazards indicates poor levels of individual and social adaptation 
  to hazards. This failing extends well beyond the water management sector as 
  conventionally defined and can be argued to reflect weaknesses in development 
  control, planning guidance, public education, and fiscal incentives. The foregoing 
  examples indicate that having the ability to adapt to change is not the same 
  as actually adapting to change: The tools often are not used, for a variety 
  of reasons.</p>
