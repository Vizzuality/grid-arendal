  The physiological adaptation to climatic variations.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Active Layer</b> <br>
  The top layer of soil in <i>permafrost</i> that is subjected to<br>
  seasonal freezing and thawing. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Adaptability</b><br>
  See <i>adaptive capacity</i>. </p>
<p><b>Adaptation<br>
  </b>Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected 
  climatic <i>stimuli</i> or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial 
  opportunities. Various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory 
  and reactive adaptation, private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned 
  adaptation:<b><br>
  </b></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><b><i>Anticipatory Adaptation</i></b>&#151;Adaptation that takes place 
      before impacts of climate change are observed. Also referred to as proactive 
      adaptation. 
  </li>
  <li><b><i>Autonomous Adaptation</i></b>&#151;Adaptation that does not constitute 
    a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is triggered by ecological changes 
    in natural systems and by market or welfare changes in human systems. Also 
    referred to as spontaneous adaptation.</li>
  <li><b><i>Planned Adaptation</i></b>&#151;Adaptation that is the result of a 
    deliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that conditions have changed 
    or are about to change and that action is required to return to, maintain, 
    or achieve a desired state.</li>
  <li><i><b>Private Adaptation</b></i>&#151;Adaptation that is initiated and implemented 
    by individuals, households or private companies. Private adaptation is usually 
    in the actor's rational self-interest.</li>
  <li><i><b>Public Adaptation</b></i>&#151;Adaptation that is initiated and implemented 
    by governments at all levels. Public adaptation is usually directed at collective 
    needs.</li>

  Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry</i> (IPCC, 2000).</p>
<p><b>Aggregate Impacts</b> <br>
  Total impacts summed up across sectors and/or regions. The aggregation of impacts 
  requires knowledge of (or assumptions about) the relative importance of impacts

  ponds.</p>
<p><b>Aquifer</b><br>
  A stratum of permeable rock that bears water. An unconfined aquifer is recharged 
  directly by local rainfall, rivers, and lakes, and the rate of recharge will 
  be influenced by the permeability of the overlying rocks and soils. A confined 
  aquifer is characterized by an overlying bed that is impermeable and the local 
  rainfall does not influence the aquifer. </p>
<p><b>Arbovirus</b><br>

  and water in the process of <i>photosynthesis</i>. </p>
<p><b>Baseflow</b><br>
  Sustained flow in a river or stream that is primarily produced by groundwater 
  runoff, delayed subsurface runoff, and/or lake outflow.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Baseline/Reference</b><br>
  The baseline (or reference) is any datum against which change is measured. It 
  might be a "current baseline," in which case it represents observable, 
  present-day conditions. It might also be a "future baseline," which 
  is a projected future set of conditions excluding the driving factor of interest. 
  Alternative interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise to multiple 
  baselines.</p>
<p><b>Basin</b><br>
  The drainage area of a stream, river, or lake.</p>

  westward to Alaska and continuing from Siberia westward across the entire extent 
  of Russia to the European Plain.</p>

  most trees and agricultural crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes, and 
  vegetables.</p>
<p><b>C<sub>4</sub> Plants</b> <br>
  Plants that produce a four-carbon compound during photosynthesis (mainly of 
  tropical origin), including grasses and the agriculturally important crops maize,

<p><b>Carbon Cycle</b><br>
  The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as in 
  carbon dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and lithosphere.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</b><br>
  A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and <i>biomass</i>, 
  as well as from land-use changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal 
  <i>anthropogenic greenhouse</i> gas that affects the Earth's<br>
  radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases 
  are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Carbon Dioxide Fertilization</b><br>
  The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric 
  <i>carbon dioxide</i> concentration. Depending on their mechanism of <i>photosynthesis</i>, 
  certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration. In particular, C<sub>3</sub> plants generally show a larger response 
  to CO<sub>2</sub> than <i>C<sub>4</sub> plants</i>.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Carbon Flux</b> <br>
  Transfer of carbon from one carbon pool to another in units of measurement of 
  mass per unit area and time (e.g., t C).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Carrying Capacity</b><br>

  can support.</p>
<p><b>Catchment</b><br>

</p>
<p><b>Chagas' Disease</b> <br>
  A parasitic disease caused by the <i>Trypanosoma</i> <i>cruzi</i> and transmitted 
  by triatomine bugs in the Americas, with two clinical periods: acute (fever,

  fatal heart condition).</p>
<p><b>Cholera</b><br>
  An intestinal infection that results in frequent watery stools, cramping abdominal 
  pain, and eventual collapse from dehydration. </p>
<p><b>Climate</b><br>
  Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," 
  or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and 
  variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months 
  to thousands of years. The classical period is 3 decades, as defined by the 
  World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface 
  variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense 
  is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.</p>
<p><b>Climate Change</b> <br>
  Climate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural 
  variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in 
  the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</i>, which 
  defines "climate change" as: "a change of climate which is attributed 
  directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the 
  global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed 
  over comparable time periods." See also <i>climate variability</i>.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Climate Model (Hierarchy)<br>
  </b>A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, 
  chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions and 
  feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known properties. 
  The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity (i.e., 
  for any one component or combination of components a hierarchy of models can 
  be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions; 
  the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly 
  represented; or the level at which empirical parameterizations are involved. 
  Coupled atmosphere/ocean/ sea-ice General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide 
  a comprehensive representation of the climate system. There is an evolution 
  towards more complex models with active chemistry and biology. Climate models 
  are applied, as a research tool, to study and simulate the climate, but also 
  for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal, and interannual climate 
  predictions.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Climate Prediction</b><br>
  A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce 
  a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of the climate 
  in the future (e.g., at seasonal, interannual, or long-term time scales. See 
  also <i>climate projection</i> and <i>climate scenario</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate Projection<br>
  </b>A projection of the response of the climate system to emission or concentration 
  scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing scenarios, 
  often based upon simulations by climate models. Climate projections are distinguished 
  from <i>climate predictions</i> in order to emphasize that climate projections 
  depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which 
  are based on assumptions, concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and<b> 
  </b>technological developments that may or may not be realized and are therefore 
  subject to substantial uncertainty.</p>
<p><b>Climate Scenario</b> <br>
  A plausible and often simplified representation of the future <i>climate</i>, 
  based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships, that 
  has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences 
  of anthropogenic climate change, often serving as input to impact models. Climate 
  projections often serve as the raw material for constructing climate scenarios, 
  but climate scenarios usually require additional information such as about the 
  observed current climate. A "climate change scenario" is the difference 
  between a climate scenario and the current climate.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Climate System</b> <br>
  The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: 
  the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the <i>cryosphere</i>, the land surface, and 
  the <i>biosphere</i>, and the interactions between them. The climate system 
  evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because 
  of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and human-induced 
  forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and <i>land use</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate Variability</b><br>
  Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics 
  (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate 
  on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. 
  Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system 
  (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external 
  forcing (external variability). See also <i>climate change</i>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>CO<sub>2</sub> Fertilization</b> <br>
  See <i>carbon dioxide fertilization</i>.</p>
<p><b>Communicable Disease</b><br>
  An infectious disease caused by transmission of an infective biological agent 
  (virus, bacterium, protozoan, or multicellular macroparasite).</p>
<p><b>Coping Range</b><br>
  The variation in climatic stimuli that a system can absorb without producing 
  significant impacts.</p>
<p><b>Coral Bleachin</b><br>

  occurs in response to physiological shock in response to abrupt changes in temperature, 
  salinity, and turbidity.</p>
<p><b>Cordillera</b><br>
  An individual mountain chain with closely connected, distinct summits. In South 
  America, "cordillera" refers to an individual mountain range. </p>
<p><b>Cryosphere</b><br>
  The component of the climate system consisting of all snow, ice, and <i>permafrost</i> 
  on and beneath the surface of the earth and ocean.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> <br>
  An opportunistic infection caused by an intestinal parasite common in animals. 
  Transmission occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with animal 
  feces. The parasite causes severe chronic diarrhea, especially in people with 
  HIV.</p>
<p><b>Deepwater Formation </b><br>
  Occurs when seawater freezes to form sea ice. The local release of salt and 
  consequent increase in water density leads to the formation of saline coldwater 
  that sinks to the ocean floor. See <i>Antarctic bottomwater</i>.</p>
<p><b>Deforestation</b><br>
  Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term <i>forest</i> 
  and related terms such as <i>afforestation</i>, <i>reforestation</i>, and <i>deforestation</i>, 
  see the IPCC <i>Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry</i> 
  (IPCC, 2000). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Dengue Fever</b><br>
  An infectious viral disease spread by mosquitoes, often called breakbone fever 
  because it is characterized by severe pain in joints and back. Subsequent infections 
  of the virus may lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome 
  (DSS), which may be fatal.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Desert</b> <br>
  An ecosystem with &lt;100 mm precipitation per year.</p>
<p><b>Desertification</b> <br>
  Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from 
  various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. Further, 
  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines land 
  degradation as a reduction or loss in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas 
  of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain-fed cropland, 
  irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting from 
  land uses or from a process or combination of processes, including those arising 
  from human activities and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil erosion caused 
  by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical, and biological 
  or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation. 
  <br>
</p>
<p><b>Diatom</b><br>
  A class of unicellular algae (Bacillariophyceae) that are widespread on soil 
  surfaces and in freshwater and marine systems, especially cold waters of relatively 
  low salinity. These have cell sizes ranging from 5 to 2000 &micro;m.</p>

  Frequency, intensity, and types of disturbances, such as fires, inspect or pest 
  outbreaks, floods, and <i>droughts</i>. </p>
<p><b>Diurnal Temperature Range</b> <br>

<p><b>Downscaling</b><br>
<p> Reducing the scale of a model from a global to regional level. 
<p> <b>Drought</b> <br>
<p> The phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below 
  normal recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely 
  affect land resource production systems. 
<p> <b>Ecosystem <br>
  </b> 
<p> A distinct system of interacting living organisms, together with their physical 
  environment. The boundaries of what could be called an ecosystem are somewhat 
  arbitrary, depending on the focus of interest or study. Thus the extent of an 
  ecosystem may range from very small spatial scales to, ultimately, the entire 
  Earth. 
<p> <b>Ecosystem Services</b> <br>
<p> 
<p>Ecological processes or functions which have value to individuals or society.</p>
<p><b>Ecotone</b> <br>
<p> 
<p>Transition area between adjacent ecological communities (e.g., between forests 
  and grasslands), usually involving competition between organisms common to both. 
  <br>
</p>
<p><b>Edaphic</b> <br>
  Of or relating to the soil; factors inherent in the soil. </p>
<p> 
<p> <b>Effective Rainfall</b> <br>
<p> The portion of the total rainfall that becomes available for plant growth. 
<p> <b>El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</b> <br>
<p> 
<p>El Ni&ntilde;o, in its original sense, is a warmwater current that periodically 
  flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. This 
  oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface 
  pressure pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, called the 
  <i>Southern Oscillation</i>. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is collectively 
  known as El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation. During an El Ni&ntilde;o event, 
  the prevailing trade winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, 
  causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie 
  the cold waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the wind, 
  sea surface temperature, and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. 
  It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts 
  of the world. The opposite of an El Ni&ntilde;o event is called La Ni&ntilde;a.</p>
<p><b>Emission Scenario</b> <br>
  A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances 
  that are potentially radiatively active (e.g., <i>greenhouse gases</i>, <i>aerosols</i>), 
  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving 
  forces (such as demographic and socioeconomic development, technological change) 
  and their key relationships. In 1992, the IPCC presented a set of emission scenarios 
  that were used as a basis for the climate projections in the Second Assessment 
  Report (IPCC, 1996). These emission scenarios are referred to as the IS92 scenarios. 
  In the IPCC <i>Special Report on Emission Scenarios </i>(Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 
  2000), new emission scenarios--the so-called SRES scenarios--were published. 
</p>
<p> <b>Endemic</b><br>
  Restricted or peculiar to a locality or region. With regard to human health, 
  endemic can refer to a disease or agent present or usually prevalent in a population 
  or geographical area at all times. </p>

<p><b>Glacier</b> <br>
  A mass of land ice flowing downhill (by internal deformation and sliding at 
  the base) and constrained by the surrounding topography (e.g., the sides of 
  a valley or surrounding peaks); the bedrock topography is the major influence 
  on the dynamics and surface slope of a glacier. A glacier is maintained by accumulation 
  of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at low altitudes or discharge 
  into the sea. 
<p> <b>Greenhouse Effect </b> <br>
<p> Greenhouse gases effectively absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's 
  surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric 
  radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward to the Earth's surface. 
  Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This 
  is called the "natural greenhouse effect." Atmospheric radiation is strongly 
  coupled to the temperature of the level at which it is emitted. In the troposphere, 
  the temperature generally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared radiation 
  emitted to space originates from an altitude with a temperature of on average 
  -19&#176;C, in balance with the net incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth's 
  surface is kept at a much higher temperature of on average 14&#176;C. An increase 
  in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads to an increased infrared opacity 
  of the atmosphere, and therefore to an effective radiation into space from a 
  higher altitude at a lower temperature. This causes a radiative forcing, an 
  imbalance that can only be compensated for by an increase of the temperature 
  of the surface-troposphere system. This is called the "enhanced greenhouse effect." 
  <b>&nbsp;</b> 
<p> <b>Greenhouse Gas <br>
  </b> 
<p> Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural 
  and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within 
  the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, 
  and clouds. This property causes the <i>greenhouse effect</i>. Water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), 
  carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), 
  and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. 
  Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the 
  atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing 
  substances which are dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  N<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub>, the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i> deals with the 
  greenhouse gases sulfur hexaflouride (SF<sub>6</sub>), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
  and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

  slope. The margins slope steeply, and the ice is discharged through fast-flowing 
  ice streams or outlet glaciers, in some cases into the sea or into ice shelves 
  floating on the sea. There are only two large ice sheets in the modern world--on

<p> <b>Radiative Forcing</b> <br>
<p> Radiative forcing is the change in the net vertical irradiance [expressed 
  in Watts per square meter (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)] at the tropopause due to an internal 
  change or a change in the external forcing of the climate system, such as a 
  change in the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> or the output of the Sun. Usually 
  radiative forcing is computed after allowing for stratospheric temperatures 
  to readjust to radiative equilibrium, but with all tropospheric properties held 
  fixed at their unperturbed values. 
<p> <b><br>
  Rangeland</b> <br>
  Unimproved grasslands, shrublands, savannas, and tundra. 
<p> <b>Reference Scenario </b> <br>

  but that have been converted to some other use. For a discussion of the term 
  <i>forest</i> and related terms such as <i>afforestation</i>, <i>reforestation</i>, 
  and<i> deforestation</i>, see the IPCC <i>Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use 
  Change, and Forestry</i> (IPCC, 2000).
<p> <b>Regeneration<br>
  </b> 
<p> The renewal of a stand of trees through either natural means (seeded onsite 
  or adjacent stands or deposited by wind, birds, or animals) or artificial means 
  (by planting seedlings or direct seeding).

<p> A component of the climate system, other than the atmosphere, that has the 
  capacity to store, accumulate, or release a substance of concern (e.g., carbon, 
  a <i>greenhouse gas</i>, or precursor). Oceans, soils, and <i>forests</i> are 
  examples of reservoirs of carbon. "Pool" is an equivalent term (note that the 
  definition of pool often includes the atmosphere). The absolute quantity of 
  substances of concern held within a reservoir at a specified time is called 
  the "stock." The term also means an artificial or natural storage place for

<p> A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, 
  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving 
  forces and key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from projections, but

  (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range, or 
  variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused by an increase 
  in the frequency of coastal flooding due to <i>sea level rise</i>).

  level. <b>&nbsp;</b> 
<p> <b>Thermocline</b> <br>
<p> The region in the world's ocean, typically at a depth of 1 km, where temperature 
  decreases rapidly with depth and which marks the boundary between the surface 
  and the ocean.
<p> <b>Thermohaline Circulation</b> <br>

  of which is absorbed by <i>stratospheric ozone</i>. Enhanced UV-B radiation 
  suppresses the immune system and can have other adverse effects on living organisms.</p>
<p><b>Uncertainty </b> <br>
  An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the 
  climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information 
  or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many 
  types of sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined 
  concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behavior. Uncertainty 
  can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (e.g., a range of values 
  calculated by various models) or by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting 
  the judgment of a team of experts).
<p> <b>Undernutrition</b> <br>

  affect other, often larger entities beyond their range; narrow geographical 
  range points to sensitivity to environmental variables, including climate, and 
  therefore attests to potential vulnerability to <i>climate change</i>.
<p> <b>United Nations Framework Convention</b> <b>on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</b> 
  <br>
<p> The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992, in New York, and signed at the 1992 
  Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Community. 
  Its ultimate objective is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations 
  in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system." It contains commitments for all Parties. Under the 
  Convention, Parties included in Annex I aim to return greenhouse gas emissions 
  not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The 
  Convention entered in force in March 1994. See also <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>.

<p> <b>Vectorial Capacity <br>
  </b> 
<p> Quantitative term used in the study of the transmission dynamics of malaria 
  to express the average number of potentially infective bites of all vectors 
  feeding upon one host in one day, or the number of new inoculations with a vector-borne 
  disease transmitted by one vector species from one infective host in one day.
<p> <b>Vernalization</b> <br>
<p> The act or process of hastening the flowering and fruiting of plants by treating 
  seeds, bulbs, or seedlings so as to induce a shortening of the vegetative period.
<p> <b>Vulnerability <br>
  </b> 
<p> The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse 
  effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability 
  is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to 
  which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
