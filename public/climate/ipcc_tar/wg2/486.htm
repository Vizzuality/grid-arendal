<h3>12.8.5. Human Environments </h3>
<p>The most vulnerable human environments in Australia and New Zealand are those 
  that are subject to potential coastal or riverine flooding, landslides, or tropical 
  cyclones and other intense storms. Adaptation to natural variability in these 
  cases usually takes the form of planning zones, such as setbacks from coasts 
  and flood levels of particular return periods or engineering standards for buildings 
  and infrastructure. Many of these settlements and structures have long lifetimes&#151;comparable 
  to that of anthropogenic climate change. This means that many planning zones 
  and design standards may become inappropriate in a changing climate.</p>
<p>Adaptation in these circumstances depends on costs and benefits, the lifetime 
  of the structures, and the acceptability of redesigned measures or structures 
  (e.g., seawalls). Thus, responses will depend in part on aesthetic and economic 
  considerations; poorer communities, such as many indigenous settlements, will 
  be particularly vulnerable. Conflicts will arise between investors with short 
  time horizons and local government or other bodies who think on longer time 
  scales and may bear responsibility for planning or emergency measures. Complex 
  jurisdictional arrangements often will add to the difficulties of adopting rational 
  adaptation measures (Waterman, 1996).</p>
<p>In an attempt to meet these problems for the Australian coastline, a guide 
  has been developed for response to rising seas and climate change (May <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998), as well as good practice and coastal engineering guidelines (Institution 
  of Engineers, 1998; RAPI, 1998).</p>
<p>Local governments in some parts of Australia and New Zealand are identifying 
  measures they could implement to adapt to climate change. For example, the Wellington 
  Regional Council is required by its Regional Policy Statement to periodically 
  review current knowledge on climate change and possible effects on natural hazards; 
  the Council already allows for climate-induced variability in its flood protection 
  activities (Green, 1999).</p>
<p>The region's health infrastructure is quite strong, and numerous existing 
  adaptations, such as quarantine and eradication of disease vectors, are available 
  to deal with the main changes expected. However, there is concern that already 
  disadvantaged communities, especially indigenous people, may not have equitable 
  access to adaptation measures. Another issue is the question of adaptations 
  to deal with a climatic impact that may cause secondary effects. Examples include 
  adaptations that require more energy production or higher water use, and vector 
  controls that result in reduced population immunity to the disease carried.</p>

<h3>12.8.6. Indigenous People</h3>
<p>Traditional indigenous societies in the region have lived in a close and conscious 
  relationship with their environment (Tunks, 1997; Skertchly and Skertchly, 2000). 
  Australian Aborigines have modified and managed the landscape through the controlled 
  use of low-intensity fire (Kohen, 1995). They have lived in Australia for at 
  least 40,000 years. Thus, they have a long history of adaptation to sea-level 
  rise, which rose by 130 m from the last glacial maximum 18,000 years ago until 
  the present level was reached 6,000 years ago. Memories of these traumatic events 
  are found in oral traditions recorded by early European settlers (Mulvaney and 
  Kamminga, 1999).</p>
<p>With the recognition of indigenous land rights, indigenous people in both countries 
  are now major land managers (Coombs <i>et al.</i>, 1990; Langton, 1997) and hence are 
  impacted by and responsible for managing climatic impacts. The importance of 
  their participation in the development of policy and response strategies to 
  climate change is discussed in New Zealand Climate Change Programme (1990) and 
  Tunks (1997), but to date their involvement has been minimal. This is a result 
  partly of greater emphasis in Australia and elsewhere on mitigation of climate 
  change rather than adaptation (Cohen, 1997), lack of indigenous community involvement 
  in climate change research, and the array of other more pressing social issues 
  for such communities (Braaf, 1999).</p>
<a name="1287"></a>
<h3>12.8.7. Extra-Regional Factors</h3>
<p>Basher <i>et al.</i> (1998) draw attention to the vulnerability of the region to external 
  influences arising from climate change&#151;in particular, from likely changes 
  in terms of trade (see also Stafford Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Increased risk of 
  invasion by exotic pests, weeds, and diseases and possible immigration from 
  neighboring territories rendered uninhabitable by rising sea level are other 
  factors. These issues exist independent of climate change but are likely to 
  be exacerbated by climate change. A variety of adaptations to deal with each 
  problem exist and can be strengthened, but the costs involved and remaining 
  impacts could be considerable.</p>
