<h4>11.2.4.4. Fisheries and Aquaculture </h4>
<p>Asia dominates world aquaculture, producing four-fifths of all farmed fish, 
  shrimp, and shellfish (FAO, 1997). Farming of fish, shrimp, shellfish, and seaweeds 
  has become a vital source of food supply in Asia in recent decades. Fishery 
  products are staples for the Asian population and are embedded in its culture. 
  Fish, an important source of food protein, is critical to food security in many 
  countries of Asia, particularly among poor communities in coastal areas. The 
  annual fish catch and aquaculture production in Asia reached a peak at about 
  20.7 and 19.1 Mt, respectively, in the year 1998. Japan has the largest distant-waters 
  fishery production. Inland fishery production is dominated by China and India, 
  which have shown increases in recent years as a result of stock enhancement 
  practices. </p>
<p>Fish farming requires land and water&#151;two resources that already are in 
  short supply in many countries in Asia. Nearly half of the land now used for 
  shrimp ponds in Thailand was formerly used for rice paddies; water diversion 
  for shrimp ponds has lowered groundwater levels noticeably in coastal areas 
  of Thailand. In China, concern over the loss of arable land has led to restrictions 
  on any further conversion of farmland to aquaculture ponds. Intensive production 
  systems and large-scale facilities used to raise high-value shrimp, salmon, 
  and other premium species has taken a heavy toll on coastal habitats, with mangrove 
  swamps in southeast Asia being cleared at an alarming rate. Thailand lost more 
  than 15% of its mangrove forests to shrimp ponds from 1987 to 1993 (World Bank, 
  1996). Destruction of mangroves has left these coastal areas exposed to erosion 
  and flooding, altered natural drainage patterns, and increased salt intrusion.</p>
<p>The fishery resources of Japan, China, and many other countries of Asia are 
  being depleted by overfishing, excessive use of pesticides, industrial pollution, 
  red tide, and even construction of dikes and other coastal structures (Zou and 
  Wu, 1993; Sato and Mimura, 1997). Loss of inshore fish nursery habitats to coastal 
  development, as well as pollution from land-based activities, causes significant 
  change to ecosystems supporting fisheries (see also <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). Marine productivity is greatly affected by temperature changes that 
  control plankton shift, such as seasonal shifting of sardine in the Sea of Japan 
  and induced during the cyclical occurrence of the ENSO in low latitudes (Chen 
  and Shen, 1999; Piyakarnchana, 1999; Terazaki, 1999). The impact of global warming 
  on fisheries will depend on the complicated food chain, which could be disturbed 
  by sea-level rise, changes in ocean currents, and alteration of mixing layer 
  thickness.</p>
<p>Anomalies in the water temperatures of major oceanic currents (e.g., declines 
  in sardine catch in the Sea of Japan associated with changing patterns of the 
  Kuroshio current in ENSO years) have resulted in low commercial fish catch in 
  recent years (Yoshino, 1998b). The steady wintertime decrease in mean wind speed 
  observed over the Sea of Japan between 1960 and 1990 has accelerated surface 
  temperature increase and stagnated bottom water formation in recent years (Varlamov 
  et al., 1997). The rise in SST will shift the southern limit of salmon species 
  further to the north (Seino et al., 1998). It is also suggested that the Sea 
  of Japan bottom water will become anoxic within a few hundred years; a decreased 
  oxygen supply will lead to major losses in biological productivity in deep waters 
  (Gamo, 1999). Fish production of certain species may decrease because of the 
  decline of river volume (Zhou, 1991). Increases in marine culture products and 
  declines in marine fishery output are current trends in most south Asian countries 
  that are engaged in commercial fishery activity. It is likely that increased 
  surface runoff and higher nutrient load might lead to potentially beneficial 
  increases in plankton within the coastal zone of boreal Asia. However, increased 
  frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o events, which are likely in a warmer atmosphere, 
  could lead to measurable declines in plankton biomass and fish larvae abundance 
  in coastal waters of south and southeast Asia (see also <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). Such declines in lower levels of the food chain will have negative impacts 
  on fisheries in Asia.</p>
