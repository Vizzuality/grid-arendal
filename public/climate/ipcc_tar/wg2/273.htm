<h3>5.8.3. Impacts on Wetland Services </h3>
<p>Generally, climatic warming is expected to start a drying trend in wetland 
  ecosystems. According to Gorham (1991), this largely indirect influence of climate 
  change, leading to alteration in the water level, would be the main agent in 
  ecosystem change and would overshadow the impacts of rising temperature and 
  longer growing seasons in boreal and subarctic peatlands. Monsoonal areas are 
  more likely to be affected by more intense rain events over shorter rainy seasons, 
  exacerbating flooding and erosion in catchments and the wetlands themselves. 
  Similarly, longer dry seasons could alter fire regimes and loss of organic matter 
  to the atmosphere (Hogenbirk and Wein, 1991).</p>
<h4><a name="5831"></a>5.8.3.1. Habitat and Biodiversity</h4>
<p>Climate change may be expected to have clear impacts on wetland ecosystems, 
  but there are only a few studies available for assessing this. There are some 
  laboratory studies concerned with the responses of individual plant species 
  or groups of species (Jauhiainen et al., 1997, 1998a,b; van der Heijden et al., 
  1998). Based on these studies, however, it is difficult to predict the responses 
  of plant communities formed by species with somewhat varying environmental requirements.</p>
<p>The response of wetland plant communities to drought has received some attention 
  in temperate freshwater wetlands (Greening and Gerritsen, 1987; Streng et al., 
  1989). Stratigraphical studies in peatlands have shown hydroseral succession 
  whereby swamp and fen communities gradually develop into bog communities (Tallis, 
  1983). These changes are largely autogenic, connected to growth of wetland communities 
  and caused by past climatic variability or artificial drainage. An alternative 
  approach to observe the vegetation-environmental change succession has been 
  to use space as a time substitute by mapping different plant communities onto 
  climatic and hydrological surfaces (Gignac et al., 1991). This approach has 
  shown tight coupling between various peatland plants, climate, hydrology, and 
  resultant chemistry&#151;and even for trace gas exchange (Bubier, 1995)&#151;and 
  has been used to infer certain aspects of peatland development through macrofossil 
  analysis (Gorham and Janssens, 1992; Kuhry et al., 1993).</p>
<p>Much is known about how vegetation changes as a result of water-level drawdown 
  following drainage for forestry in northwestern Europe. Drying of surface soil 
  initiates a secondary succession whereby original wetland species gradually 
  are replaced by species that are typical of forests and heathlands (Laine and 
  Vanha-Majamaa, 1992; Vasander et al., 1993, 1997; Laine et al., 1995). Plants 
  living on wet surfaces are the first to disappear, whereas hummock-dwelling 
  species may benefit from drying of surface soil. In nutrient-poor peatlands, 
  bog dwarf-shrubs dominate after water-level drawdown; at more nutrient-rich 
  sites, species composition develops toward upland forest vegetation (Laine and 
  Vanha-Majamaa, 1992; Minkkinen et al., 1999).</p>
<p>The effect of sea-level rise on wetlands has been addressed in several assessments. 
  In northern Australia, extensive seasonally inundated freshwater swamps and 
  floodplains are major biodiversity foci (Finlayson et al., 1988). They extend 
  for approximately 100 km or more along many rivers but could be all but displaced 
  if predicted sea-level rises of 10-30 cm by 2030 occur and are associated 
  with changes in rainfall in the catchment and tidal/storm surges (Bayliss et 
  al., 1997; Eliot et al., 1999). Expected changes have been demonstrated by using 
  information collected from the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park, but 
  the scenario of massive displacement of these freshwater wetlands can be extended 
  further afield given similarities in low relief, monsoonal rainfall, and geomorphic 
  processes (Finlayson and Woodroffe, 1996; Eliot et al., 1999). In fact, the 
  potential outcome of such change can be seen in the nearby Mary River system, 
  where saline intrusion, presumably caused by other anthropogenic events, already 
  has destroyed 17,000 ha of freshwater woodland and sedge/grassland (Woodroffe 
  and Mulrennan, 1993; Jonauskas, 1996).</p>
<p>Mechanisms by which environmental factors and biotic interactions control wetland 
  biodiversity are not well understood (Gorham, 1994b). The effects of water-level 
  drawdown after drainage for forestry indicate that the shift in species composition 
  from bog and fen species to forest species only slightly affects plant species 
  richness of individual sites (Laine et al., 1995). In regions dominated by forests, 
  there would be clear reduction in regional diversity as landscapes become homogenized 
  after drainage (Vasander et al., 1997).</p>
<p>The inherent changeability of wetland communities, resulting from spatial and 
  temporal variability in water supply (Tallis, 1983), may be the key factor in 
  the response of wetland communities to climate change. Because there may be 
  differences between species in adaptation potential, community structures would 
  change, and there would be profound effects on the nature of the affected wetlands, 
  as discussed by Gorham (1994a). The response of wetland plant communities to 
  changing environment may have fundamental effects on the species diversity of 
  these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Because of spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem processes, development 
  of systems models for wetlands is becoming an important assessment tool. A fully 
  coupled peatland-climate model has not yet been developed, but there have been 
  some significant advances in modeling various components of the peatland and/or 
  wetland biogeochemical system (Harris and Frolking, 1992; Roulet et al., 1992; 
  Christensen and Cox, 1995; Christensen et al., 1996; Walter et al., 1996; Granberg, 
  1998), and several process-level models are now used at the global scale (Cao 
  et al., 1996; Potter et al., 1996; Potter, 1997).</p>
<p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels will increase photosynthetic rates in some types 
  of vegetation (e.g., C<sub>3</sub> trees and emergent macrophytes) (Bazzaz et 
  al., 1990; Idso and Kimball, 1993; Drake et al., 1996; Megonigal and Schlesinger, 
  1997; see also <a href="250.htm#5631">Section 5.6.3.1</a>). Responses of nonvascular 
  vegetation, such as sphagna, have been less clear (Jauhiainen et al., 1994, 
  1997, 1998a; Jauhiainen and Silvola, 1999). A study in Alaskan tussock tundra 
  found that photosynthetic rates in Eriophorum vaginatum quickly adjusted downward 
  such that rates with elevated and ambient CO<sub>2</sub> were similar after 
  1 year (Tissue and Oechel, 1987). However, a sustained increase in net ecosystem 
  carbon sequestration was observed when elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatments were 
  combined with a 4&deg;C increase in temperature (Oechel et al., 1994). </p>
<p>Many C<sub>3</sub> plants respond to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> with a decrease 
  in stomatal conductance (Curtis, 1996), which could reduce transpiration rates. 
  Because transpiration is an important pathway for water loss from many ecosystems 
  (Schlesinger, 1997), including wetlands (Richardson and McCarthy, 1994), reductions 
  in transpiration rate could affect the position of the aerobic-anaerobic interface 
  in wetland soils (Megonigal and Schlesinger, 1997).</p>
