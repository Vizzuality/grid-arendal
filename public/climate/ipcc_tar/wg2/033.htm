<h2>4.3. Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems </h2>
<p>Ecosystems are subject to many pressures, such as land-use changes, deposition 
  of nutrients and pollutants, harvesting, grazing by livestock, introduction 
  of exotic species, and natural climate variability. Climate change constitutes 
  an additional pressure that could change or endanger these systems. The impact 
  of climate change on these systems will be influenced by land and water management 
  adaptation and interactions with other pressures. Adaptive capacity is greater 
  for more intensively managed lands and waters and in production of marketed 
  goods (e.g., timber production in plantations) than in less intensively managed 
  lands and nonmarket values of those lands and waters. [<a href="201.htm">5.1</a>, 
  <a href="202.htm">5.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Populations of many species already are threatened and are expected to be 
  placed at greater risk by the synergy between the stresses of changing climate, 
  rendering portions of current habitat unsuitable, and land-use change that fragments 
  habitats.</i> Without adaptation, some species that currently are classified 
  as "critically endangered" will become extinct, and the majority of those labeled 
  "endangered or vulnerable" will become much rarer in the 21st century (high 
  confidence). This may have the greatest impact on the lowest income human societies, 
  which rely on wildlife for subsistence living. In addition, there is high confidence 
  that loss or reduction of species would impact the services provided by wildlife 
  through roles within an ecosystem (e.g., pollination, natural pest control), 
  recreation (e.g., sport hunting, wildlife viewing), and cultural and religious 
  practices of indigenous people. Possible adaptation methods to reduce risks 
  to species could include establishment of refuges, parks, and reserves with 
  corridors to allow migration of species, as well as use of captive breeding 
  and translocation. However, these options may have limitations of cost. [<a href="218.htm">5.4</a>]</p>
<p><i>There are now substantial observational and experimental studies demonstrating 
  the link between change in regional climate and biological or physical processes 
  in ecosystems.</i> These include a lengthening of vegetative growing season 
  by 1.2 to 3.6 days per decade in the high northern latitudes (one factor leading 
  to community composition changes); warming of lakes and rivers as a result of 
  shortening duration of ice cover; upward range shifts in alpine herbs; and increased 
  mortality and range contraction of wildlife as a result of heat stress. Others 
  include changes in population sizes, body sizes, and migration times (see <a href="024.htm#21">TS 
  2.1</a> and <a href="050.htm#71">7.1</a>, <a href="050.htm#figts11">Figure TS-11</a>, 
  and <a href="050.htm#tabts16">Table TS-16</a> for additional information). [<a href="203.htm">5.2.1</a>]</p>
<p><i>Vegetation distribution models since the SAR suggest that mass ecosystem 
  or biome movement is most unlikely to occur because of different climatic tolerance 
  of the species involved, different migration abilities, and the effects of invading 
  species.</i> Species composition and dominance will change, resulting in ecosystem 
  types that may be quite different from those we see today. These changes will 
  lag the changes in climate by years to decades to centuries (high confidence). 
  The effects of changes in disturbances such as fire, blowdown, or pest attacks 
  on vegetation have not been included in these studies. [<a href="202.htm">5.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Recent modeling studies continue to show potential for significant disruption 
  of ecosystems under climate change (high confidence).</i> Further development 
  of simple correlative models that were available at the time of the SAR point 
  to areas where ecosystem disruption and the potential for ecosystem migration 
  are high. Observational data and newer dynamic vegetation models linked to transient 
  climate models are refining the projections. However, the precise outcomes depend 
  on processes that are too subtle to be fully captured by current models. [<a href="202.htm">5.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would increase net primary productivity 
  (plant growth, litterfall, and mortality) in most systems, whereas increasing 
  temperature may have positive or negative effects (high confidence).</i> Experiments 
  on tree species grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> over several years show 
  continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis and little evidence of 
  long-term loss of sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>. However, changes in net ecosystem 
  productivity (which includes plant growth, litterfall, mortality, litter decomposition, 
  and soil carbon dynamics) and net biome productivity (which includes those effects 
  plus the effects of fire or other disturbances) are less likely to be positive 
  and may be generally negative. Research reported since the SAR confirms the 
  view that the largest and earliest impacts induced by climate change are likely 
  to occur in boreal forests, through changes in weather-related disturbance regimes 
  and nutrient cycling. [<a href="243.htm">5.6.1.1</a>, <a href="250.htm#5631">5.6.3.1</a>]</p>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems appear to be storing increasing amounts of carbon. At 
  the time of the SAR, this was attributed largely to increasing plant productivity 
  because of the interaction among elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, increasing 
  temperatures, and soil moisture changes. Recent results confirm that productivity 
  gains are occurring but suggest that they are smaller under field conditions 
  than plant-pot experiments indicate (<i>medium confidence</i>). Hence, the terrestrial 
  uptake may be caused more by change in uses and management of land than by the 
  direct effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and climate. The degree to which terrestrial 
  ecosystems continue to be net sinks for carbon is uncertain because of the complex 
  interactions between the aforementioned factors (e.g., arctic terrestrial ecosystems 
  and wetlands may act as sources and sinks) (<i>medium confidence</i>).</p>
<p><i>In arid or semi-arid areas (e.g., rangelands, dry forests/ woodlands) where 
  climate change is likely to decrease available soil moisture, productivity is 
  expected to decrease.</i> Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may counteract 
  some of these losses. However, many of these areas are affected by El Ni&ntilde;o/La 
  Ni&ntilde;a, other climatic extremes, and disturbances such as fire. Changes 
  in the frequencies of these events and disturbances could lead to loss of productivity 
  thus potential land degradation, potential loss of stored carbon, or decrease 
  in the rate of carbon uptake (medium confidence). [<a href="231.htm">5.5</a>]</p>
<p><i>Some wetlands will be replaced by forests or heathlands, and those overlying 
  permafrost are likely to be disrupted as a result of thawing of permafrost (high 
  confidence).</i> The initial net effect of warming on carbon stores in high-latitude 
  ecosystems is likely to be negative because decomposition initially may respond 
  more rapidly than production. In these systems, changes in albedo and energy 
  absorption during winter are likely to act as a positive feedback to regional 
  warming as a result of earlier melting of snow and, over decades to centuries, 
  poleward movement of the treeline. [<a href="267.htm">5.8</a>, <a href="276.htm">5.9</a>]</p>
<p><i>Most wetland processes are dependent on catchment-level hydrology; thus, 
  adaptations for projected climate change may be practically impossible.</i> 
  Arctic and subarctic ombrotrophic bog communities on permafrost, as well as 
  more southern depressional wetlands with small catchment areas, are likely to 
  be most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing speed of peatland conversion 
  and drainage in southeast Asia is likely to place these areas at a greatly increased 
  risk of fires and affect the viability of tropical wetlands. [<a href="267.htm">5.8</a>]</p>
<p><i>Opportunities for adapting to expected changes in high-latitude and alpine 
  ecosystems are limited because these systems will respond most strongly to globally 
  induced changes in climate.</i> Careful management of wildlife resources could 
  minimize climatic impacts on indigenous peoples. Many high-latitude regions 
  depend strongly on one or a few resources, such as timber, oil, reindeer, or 
  wages from fighting fires. Economic diversification would reduce the impacts 
  of large changes in the availability or economic value of particular goods and 
  services. High levels of endemism in many alpine floras and their inability 
  to migrate upward means that these species are very vulnerable. [<a href="276.htm">5.9</a>]</p>
<p><i>Contrary to the SAR, global timber market studies that include adaptations 
  through land and product management suggest that climate change would increase 
  global timber supply (medium confidence).</i> At the regional and global scales, 
  the extent and nature of adaptation will depend primarily on wood and non-wood 
  product prices, the relative value of substitutes, the cost of management, and 
  technology. On specific sites, changes in forest growth and productivity will 
  constrain&#151;and could limit&#151;choices regarding adaptation strategies 
  (high confidence). In markets, prices will mediate adaptation through land and 
  product management. Adaptation in managed forests will include salvaging dead 
  and dying timber, replanting new species that are better suited to the new climate, 
  planting genetically modified species, and intensifying or decreasing management. 
  Consumers will benefit from lower timber prices; producers may gain or lose, 
  depending on regional changes in timber productivity and potential dieback effects. 
  [<a href="242.htm">5.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Climate change will lead to poleward movement of the southern and northern 
  boundaries of fish distributions, loss of habitat for cold- and coolwater fish, 
  and gain in habitat for warmwater fish (high confidence).</i> As a class of 
  ecosystems, inland waters are vulnerable to climatic change and other pressures 
  owing to their small size and position downstream from many human activities 
  (high confidence). The most vulnerable elements include reduction and loss of 
  lake and river ice (very high confidence), loss of habitat for coldwater fish 
  (very high confidence), increases in extinctions and invasions of exotics (high 
  confidence), and potential exacerbation of existing pollution problems such 
  as eutrophication, toxics, acid rain, and UV-B radiation (medium confidence).
