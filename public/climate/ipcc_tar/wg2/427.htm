<h2>11.2. Key Regional Concerns </h2>
<p>Despite global technological and economic development, a large proportion of 
  the nearly 1.5 billion people living in severe poverty at the dawn of the new 
  millennium are located in Asia. Global per capita water supplies are declining 
  and are now 30% lower than they were 25 years ago. By 2050, as much as 42% of 
  the world's population may have to live in countries with insufficient 
  freshwater stocks to meet the combined needs of agriculture, industry, and domestic 
  use. The world's population will reach at least 8.9 billion by the middle 
  of the 21st century (United Nations, 1998). India and China alone now account 
  for 38% of the world's population. Most of the additional population would 
  be in developing countries. These countries are likely to suffer adverse agricultural 
  responses; significant changes in seasonal runoff; possibly severe vector-borne 
  diseases; increased risks of severe tropical weather disturbances, including 
  storms; vulnerability to sea-level rise; and other stresses. This section presents 
  key regional concerns of various subregions of Asia related to climate change.</p>
<h3><a name="1121"></a>11.2.1. Ecosystems and Biodiversity</h3>
<h4><a name="11211"></a>11.2.1.1. Mountain and Highland Systems</h4>
<p>Relatively hospitable mountain regions in Asia are under pressure from human 
  settlements and commercial cultivation, which have led to land degradation and 
  adverse effects on water supply. Ongoing changes in different mountain systems 
  within Asia include those associated with high crop production and those characterized 
  by extensive animal husbandry and pastureland. Human encroachment in mountain 
  regions has reduced vegetation cover, which has increased soil moisture evaporation, 
  erosion, and siltation&#151;with adverse effects on water quality and other 
  resources. Changes in the snowfall pattern have been observed in mountain and 
  highland systems, particularly in the Himalayas (Verghese and Iyer, 1993). These 
  changes will have wider implications&#151;from marked impact on the monsoon 
  regime to seasonal runoff and vegetation cover, including agriculture. Changes 
  in the hydrological regime also will trigger episodes of extreme events.</p>
<p>One-tenth of the world's known species of higher altitude plants and animals 
  occur in the Himalayas. In addition, some countries in Asia are centers of origin 
  for many crop and fruit-tree species; as such, they are important sources of 
  genes for their wild relatives. Biodiversity is being lost in these regions 
  because of human activities, especially land degradation and the overuse of 
  resources. In 1995, approximately 10% of known species in the Himalayas were 
  listed as threatened, and the number of species on the verge of extinction has 
  increased since then. As a consequence of global warming, the present distribution 
  of species in high-elevation ecosystems is projected to shift to higher elevations, 
  although the rates of vegetation change are expected to be slow and colonization 
  success would be constrained by increased erosion and overland flows in the 
  highly dissected and steep terrains of the Himalayan mountain range. Weedy species 
  with a wide ecological tolerance will have an advantage over others (Kitayama 
  and Mueller-Dombois, 1995). High-elevation tree species&#151;such as Abies, 
  Acer, and Betula&#151;prevail in cold climates because of their adaptations 
  to chilling winters. In Japan, the area of suitable habitat at higher elevations 
  has shrunk over the past 30 years, and the variety of alpine plants that grow 
  there has been rapidly reduced (Masuzawa, 1997, 2000). Increases in temperature 
  would result in competition between such species and new arrivals. The sensitivity 
  of alpine flora to climatic factors and, in particular, water stress in the 
  summit region of Mt. Kinabalu&#151;the highest mountain in southeast Asia&#151;already 
  have been demonstrated (Kitayama, 1996; Aiba and Kitayama, 1999). The accumulated 
  stresses of climate change are likely to disrupt the ecology of mountain and 
  highland systems.</p>
