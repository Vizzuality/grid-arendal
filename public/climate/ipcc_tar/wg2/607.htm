<p><a name="fig167"></a><a href="596.htm#fig161">Figure 16-1</a> illustrates the 
  geographic distribution of permafrost and ground ice in the northern hemisphere. 
  Computations based on a digital version of the map by Brown <i>et al</i>. (1997) 
  indicate that permafrost currently underlies 24.5% of the exposed land area 
  of the northern hemisphere (Zhang <i>et al</i>., 1999). Under climatic warming, 
  much of this terrain would be vulnerable to subsidence, particularly in areas 
  of relatively warm, discontinuous permafrost (Osterkamp <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Anisimov and Nelson (1997) conducted experiments with a simple model of permafrost 
  distribution driven by three transient GCMs (as reported by Greco <i>et al</i>., 
  1994). <a href="#fig167">Figure 16-7</a> shows the mid-range result from this 
  study; the area of the northern hemisphere occupied by permafrost eventually 
  could be reduced by 12-22% of its current extent. Experiments by Smith and Burgess 
  (1999) with a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> GCM indicated that permafrost eventually could 
  disappear from half of the present-day Canadian permafrost region. Thawing of 
  ice-rich permafrost is subject, however, to considerable lag resulting from 
  the large latent heat of fusion of ice. Simulations by Riseborough and Smith 
  (1993), for example, indicate that areas of 5 m thick ice-rich permafrost near 
  the southern limit of the discontinuous zone in subarctic Canada could thaw 
  in less than 70 years. Where permafrost currently is thick, it could persist 
  in relict form for centuries or millennia. <a href="#fig167">Figure 16-7</a> 
  therefore is best regarded as indicating areas in which considerable potential 
  exists for changes in permafrost distribution. Nonetheless, pronounced changes 
  in permafrost temperature, surface morphology, and distribution are expected 
  (Smith and Burgess, 1998, 1999; Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16253"></a>16.2.5.3. Environmental Impacts </h4>
<p>The geological record of the Arctic shows abundant evidence for regional-scale 
  deterioration of permafrost in response to climatic change. Thawing of ice-rich 
  permafrost can result in subsidence of the ground surface and development of 
  uneven and frequently unstable topography known as thermokarst terrain. In unglaciated 
  parts of Siberia, alases (coalescing thaw depressions) formed during Holocene 
  warm intervals occupy areas as large as 25 km<sup>2</sup>. Cryostratigraphic 
  studies in northwestern Canada have documented thaw unconformities in the form 
  of truncated ice wedges associated with climatic warming during the early Holocene 
  (Burn, 1997, 1998). Warming of permafrost and thaw subsidence has been reported 
  widely from subarctic regions in recent years (Fedorov, 1996; Osterkamp and 
  Romanovsky, 1999; Osterkamp <i>et al</i>., 2000; Wolfe <i>et al</i>., 2000; Zuidhoff and Kolstrup, 
  2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Changes in active-layer thickness could have marked impacts on local environments 
  (Anisimov <i>et al</i>., 1997; Burgess <i>et al</i>., 2000a; Dyke, 2000). Thawing of perennially 
  frozen subsurface materials will create few problems where permafrost is "dry" 
  (Bockheim and Tarnocai, 1998). However, thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be 
  accompanied by mass movements and subsidence of the surface, possibly increasing 
  delivery of sediment to watercourses and causing damage to infrastructure in 
  developed regions. Many recent examples of such phenomena already have been 
  reported, and a poll conducted for the Canadian Climate Centre showed that most 
  of the engineers interviewed think that climate warming is a very important 
  factor for the stability of structures in permafrost regions (Williams, 1995; 
  Vyalov <i>et al</i>., 1998; Weller and Anderson, 1999). Weller and Lange (1999) note 
  that the bearing capacity of permafrost has decreased with warming, resulting 
  in failure of pilings for buildings and pipelines, as well as roadbeds. Accelerated 
  permafrost thawing has led to costly increases in road damage and maintenance. 
  In Alaska, for example, it costs as much as US$1.5 million to replace 1 km of 
  road system. However, eventual disappearance of permafrost reduces construction 
  problems. <br>
</p>
<p>Degradation of permafrost, which depends on the precipitation regime and drainage 
  conditions, poses a serious threat to Arctic biota through oversaturation or 
  desiccation of the surface (Callaghan and Jonasson, 1995). Changes in permafrost 
  and active-layer thickness will produce a complicated response. Development 
  of thermokarst in relatively warm, discontinuous permafrost in central Alaska 
  has transformed some upland forests into extensive wetlands (Osterkamp <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000). In contrast, climatic warming in the northern foothills of the 
  Brooks Range could lead to increasing plant density, resulting in evolutionary 
  transitions from nonacidic to acidic tundra or shrub tundra. Despite increasing 
  air temperature, such changes could prevent increases in active-layer thickness 
  (Walker <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
