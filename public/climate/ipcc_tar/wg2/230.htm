<h3>5.4.5. Equity Issues </h3>
<p>People in many parts of the world are dependent on wildlife for all or part 
  of their daily nutritional needs. A typical adaptive response to this situation 
  would be to replace all or part of this food with store-bought products. This 
  might be feasible in areas near developed societies but could become increasingly 
  difficult in more remote communities. However, there is more to subsistence 
  hunting than the capture of food. Subsistence hunting plays a major role in 
  the culture of Cree communities in northern Canada. "The killing, preparation, 
  sharing, and consumption of game is central to the seasonal renewal of social 
  relations in Cree villages, and of a relationship to the land which is both 
  secular and sacred in importance" (Scott, 1987). Even if compensations 
  or substitutions for subsistence uses could be made, there still would be equity 
  issues stemming from the loss of culture associated with this way of life.</p>
<p>Many of the aforementioned potential adaptations are more applicable to developed 
  countries than in developing countries. For example, the use of leased honeybees 
  is not applicable to crops fertilized by flying foxes or other wild animals. 
  The same can be said of many forms of seed dispersal. Increased use of pesticides 
  may require more capital than is available to small farmers in some developing 
  countries (Pimentel et al., 1992). Adaptations that may be practical for developed 
  countries simply may not be equitable for developing countries. </p>
<h3><a name="546"></a>5.4.6. Vulnerabilities, Sensitivities, Uncertainties</h3>
<p>In trying to understand and predict potential impacts of climate change on 
  wildlife species, some species and geographic areas are found to be at greater 
  risk than others. Species with small populations, restricted ranges, and specific 
  habitat requirements often are most vulnerable (see <a href="218.htm#5412">Section 
  5.4.1.2</a>). </p>
<p>Migratory species may be especially vulnerable because they require separate 
  breeding, wintering, and migration habitats. In many cases, one or more of these 
  habitats could be at risk because of climate change and other habitat loss. 
  For example, a large portion of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly 
  (Danaus plexippus) winters in a small region of warm-temperate dry forest in 
  Mexico. With climate change, this area is projected to contain trees that are 
  more typical of a subtropical dry forest&#151;probably unsuitable for wintering 
  monarchs (Villers-Ru&iacute;z and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez, 1998). The relative 
  vulnerability of shorebird migration sites in the United States varies, depending 
  on local geomorphologic and anthropogenic factors, and these factors could exacerbate 
  the effects of sea-level rise. For example, southern San Francisco Bay could 
  lose most of its intertidal feeding habitat with a 2&deg;C average temperature 
  rise (medium confidence) (Galbraith et al., 2001). </p>
<p>One key region of concern is the Arctic and Antarctic, where the temperature 
  increase is projected to be large and changes to habitat availability and accessibility 
  (e.g., freezing and thawing of sea ice and tundra) are expected. Such changes 
  may hamper migration, reproduction, and survival of many species, including 
  birds, polar bears (Ursus maritimus), caribou, and musk-oxen (Jefferies et al., 
  1992; Stirling and Derocher, 1993; Gunn and Skogland, 1997; Stirling, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Many biological uncertainties exist in the understanding of ecosystem processes. 
  Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that projecting impacts of climatic 
  change on a variety of wildlife species is possible (medium confidence). Laboratory 
  and field studies have demonstrated that climate plays a strong role in limiting 
  species' ranges (high confidence). Only a small fraction of all species have 
  been monitored long enough to detect significant trends. Most monitored species 
  that show significant trends have exhibited changes over the past few decades 
  that are consistent with local warming and expected physiological responses 
  (high confidence). However, potential specific changes in wildlife resulting 
  from climate change can be projected only with low confidence for most species 
  because of many possible contributing factors, such as habitat destruction and 
  exotic invasive species. Some species clearly are responding to global change 
  (see <a href="220.htm">Section 5.4.3</a>), and many more changes probably have 
  gone undetected. Researchers are in the process of coupling these discernible 
  changes with various biological theories regarding climate and species spatial 
  and temporal patterns; through this process, we expect that reliable general 
  projections can be and in fact are being made (high confidence). </p>
<p>Scientists also need to develop a better understanding of how all of the components 
  of ecosystems work together. The role each species plays in ecosystem services, 
  in wild and managed systems, is necessary to understand risks and possible surprises 
  associated with species loss. Without this information, the probability of surprises 
  associated with species loss is high (medium confidence).</p>
