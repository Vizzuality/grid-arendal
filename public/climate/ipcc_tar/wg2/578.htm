<p>Changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events such as hurricanes, 
  avalanches, fires, and floods have considerable implications for tourism and 
  recreation. One likely consequence of global climate change is sea-level rise. 
  This may have considerable consequences for the provision of recreational opportunities 
  in coastal communities, particularly if it is associated with increased storm 
  frequency.<br>

        <b>Figure 15-8</b>: Reductions in claims payable, by size of loss. Ability 
        of U.S. property-casualty insurance sector, as a whole, to pay claims 
        over a wide range of losses. The chart shows four views, encompassing 
        changes in capacity between 1991 and 1997 and whether companies have access 
        to resources of groups that own them. Groups are not obligated to pay 
        losses experienced by individual member firms but retain the option to 
        do so. Together, these four scenarios represent a range of ability to 
        pay losses. For example, for a US$155 billion loss year&#151;a recent 
        estimate of probable maximum loss (PML) (GAO, 2000) could be several events 
        combined, including weather- and nonweather-related ones&#151;65 to 90% 
        of claims would be paid (adapted from Cummins et al., 1999). PML benchmarks 
        are from GAO (2000).</p>

<p><a name="fig158"></a>Coastal zones are among the most highly valued recreational 
  areas and are primary tourist destinations. Houston (1996) estimates that 85% 
  of all tourist revenues in the United States are earned by coastal states, and 
  there are as many as 180 million recreational visitors to U.S. coasts every 
  year (Boesch et al., 2000). Sea-level rise in beach areas backed by seawalls 
  or other development that precludes landward migration would lead to loss of 
  beach area through inundation or erosion and pose an increased threat to the 
  recreation infrastructure concentrated along the coast (sea-front resorts, marinas, 
  piers, etc.). Beach nourishment is widely used to protect highly valued recreational 
  beaches. One study estimates that this adaptation strategy would cost US$14-21 
  billion to preserve major U.S. recreational beaches from a 50-cm sea-level rise 
  (Wall, 1998c). Furthermore, impacts to ecologically important wetlands and coral 
  reefs also could have major implications for sport fishing and diving-related 
  tourism activities in coastal regions. The risk to coastal recreation is most 
  prominent in warm-weather destinations in the southern United States and small 
  island nations in the Caribbean (see <a href="619.htm">Chapter 17</a> and <a href="589.htm#153210">Section 
  15.3.2.10</a>), where tourism is a leading sector of the economy.<br>
</p>
<p>Intersectoral resource competition also may become more pronounced, particularly 
  with respect to water resources. Climate change scenarios for the Trent-Severn 
  Waterway (Walker, 1996) indicate that regulation of flows for adequate downstream 
  municipal demand would diminish the recreational boating industry, with attendant 
  impacts for riparian recreational home property values. Increased municipal 
  and agricultural water demand in arid regions may outweigh development of new 
  golf courses and, in severe cases, diminish the capacity to irrigate existing 
  facilities economically. Like declining resource availability and quality, increased 
  resource competition may constrain the opportunities afforded by a longer recreational 
  season. <br>
</p>
<p>Two main groups can be considered with respect to the potential to adapt to 
  climate change: participants themselves and businesses and communities that 
  cater to them. The former may be able to adapt to climate change much more readily 
  than the latter, which are more likely to have large amounts of capital invested 
  in fixed locations. The effect of and potential for substitution as an adaptive 
  strategy, including locations (beach, ski resort), preferred species (coldwater 
  vs. warmwater fish), and recreational activities broadly (skiing to mountain 
  hiking, snowmobile to all-terrain vehicle use, golf to sailing) require more 
  detailed investigation.<br>
</p>
<p>Tourism and recreation are not regarded as major net generators of greenhouse 
  gases (except, perhaps, in the travel phase), but GHG reduction policies (e.g., 
  carbon taxes) may increase the cost of travel, with substantial implications 
  for destination areas (particularly isolated destinations with little domestic 
  tourism demand). <br>
</p>
<p>Improvement in climate change projections, although helpful, will be insufficient 
  to improve understanding of the implications of climate change for tourism and 
  recreation. Even if climate change could be reliably forecast now, it is doubtful 
  if the industry has sufficient understanding of its sensitivity to climatic 
  variability to plan rationally for future conditions. Furthermore, the salience 
  of climate change versus other long-term influencing variables in this sector 
  (globalization and economic fluctuations, fuel prices, aging populations in 
  industrialized countries, increasing travel safety and health concerns, increased 
  environmental and cultural awareness, advances in information and transportation 
  technology, environmental limitations&#151;water supply and pollution) remains 
  a critical source of uncertainty. <br>
</p>
<p>Global climate change will present challenges and opportunities for recreational 
  industries and destination areas. The net economic impact of altered competitive 
  relationships within the tourism and recreation sector is highly uncertain. 
  Studies by Mendelsohn and Markowski (1999) and Loomis and Crespi (1999) attempt 
  to put an economic value on climate change impacts in the United States. Although 
  these were pioneering efforts, the assumptions and methods employed limit the 
  confidence that can be placed in the findings. Until systematic national-level 
  analyses of economically important recreation industries and integrated sectoral 
  assessments for major tourism regions have been completed, there will be insufficient 
  confidence in the magnitude of potential economic impacts to report a range 
  (based on disparate climate, social, technical, and economic assumptions) of 
  possible implications for this sector.</p>
