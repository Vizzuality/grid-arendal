<p>Changes to below 1,000 m in the Arctic Ocean have been observed, with less 
  sea ice and freshening of the Beaufort Sea mixed layer (Maslanik <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; and McPhee <i>et al</i>., 1998). Atlantic water inflow to the Arctic Ocean 
  has warmed (Carmack <i>et al</i>., 1995). The halocline, which isolates the 
  surface from this warmer Atlantic water, has grown thinner (Steele and Boyd, 
  1998). Data gathered from submarines indicate that sea-surface temperature (SST) 
  in the Arctic basin increased by 1&deg;C over the past 20 years, and the area 
  of warm Atlantic water in the polar basin increased by almost 500,000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  (Kotlyakov, 1997). Field measurements in 1994 and 1995 showed consistent Arctic 
  seawater warming of 0.5-1.0&deg;C, with a maximum detected in the Kara 
  Sea (Alekseev <i>et al</i>., 1997). It is not yet clear whether these changes 
  are part of low-frequency natural variability or whether they represent the 
  early impacts of long-term climate change.</p>
<p>Thickening of the active layer and changes in the distribution and temperature 
  of permafrost are further important indicators of warming in the Arctic. Permafrost 
  thawing has led to major erosion problems and landslides in the Mackenzie basin 
  (Cohen, 1997a) and has caused major landscape changes from forest to bogs, grasslands, 
  and wetland ecosystems in Alaska, affecting land use. In central and western 
  Canada and in Alaska, contraction in the extent of permafrost has occurred during 
  the 20th century (Halsey <i>et al</i>., 1995; Weller, 1998; Weller and Lange, 
  1999; Osterkamp <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, a cooling trend has been noted 
  for permafrost in eastern Canada (Allard <i>et al</i>., 1995; Allard and Kasper, 
  1998). Permafrost degradation during the 20th century in subarctic and boreal 
  peatlands of Quebec is discussed by Laberge and Payette (1995).</p>
<p>Temperatures at the top of permafrost along a several hundred kilometer north-south 
  transect in central Alaska warmed by 0.5-1.5&deg;C between the late 1980s 
  and 1996. Thawing rates of about 0.1 m per year were calculated for two sites 
  (Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999). On the north slope of Alaska and in northwestern 
  Canada, the temperature-depth profile indicates a temperature rise of 2-4&deg;C 
  over the past century (Lachenbruch and Marshall 1986). In the western Yamal 
  Peninsula, temperatures at a depth of 10 m in ice-rich permafrost increased 
  0.1-1.0&deg;C between 1980 and 1998; the largest increases in Siberian 
  permafrost temperatures have occurred in relatively cold permafrost in the continuous 
  zone.</p>
<p>Palaeoclimate reconstructions based on dendrochronology also indicate a steady 
  increase in temperature during the past 150 years (Bradley and Jones 1993; Szeicz 
  and MacDonald 1995; see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). Growth rings in Larix Sibirica from northern Siberia show that mean 
  temperatures during the 20th century were the highest in 1,000 years, exceeding 
  even those during the Medieval Warm Period (Briffa <i>et al</i>., 1995). Changes 
  in diatom assemblages in lake sediments in the High Arctic over the same period 
  also are thought to be a consequence of climatic warming (Douglas <i>et al</i>., 
  1994).</p>
<p>Other changes in terrestrial ecosystems include northward movement of the treeline, 
  reduced nutritional value of browsing for caribou and moose, decreased water 
  availability, and increased forest fire tendencies (Weller and Lange, 1999). 
  There are altered plant species composition, especially forbs and lichen, on 
  the tundra. In the marine ecosystem, northern fur seal pups on the major Bering 
  Sea breeding grounds declined by half between the 1950s and the 1980s. In parts 
  of the Gulf of Alaska, harbor seal numbers are as much as 90% below what they 
  were in the 1970s. There have been significant declines in the populations of 
  some seabird species, including common murres, thick-billed murres, and kittiwakes. 
  Comprehensive interviews by Gibson and Scullinger (1998) have revealed notable 
  impacts on food sources and natural environments of native Alaskan communities. 
  Warmer climate has increased growing degree days by 20% for agriculture and 
  forestry in Alaska, and boreal forests are expanding northward at a rate of 
  about 100 km per &deg;C (Weller and Lange, 1999).<br clear="all"></p>
