<h2>5.5. Rangelands (Grasslands, Savannas, and Deserts)</h2>
<p>Rangelands here are taken to include deserts (cold, hot, and tundra), grasslands 
  (unimproved), scrub, chaparral, and savannas (after, e.g., Allen-Diaz, 1996). 
  This section does not consider improved grasslands or croplands in detail because 
  they are covered in <a href="208.htm">Section 5.3</a>. It does partly cover 
  tundra because it is an important grazing system; that ecosystem is discussed 
  in more detail in <a href="276.htm">Section 5.9</a>.</p>
<p>Ecosystems within rangelands are characterized by low-stature vegetation because 
  of temperature and moisture restrictions; they are found on every continent 
  (Allen-Diaz, 1996). They are adapted to great variations in temperature and 
  rainfall on an annual and interannual basis, but they generally are confined 
  to areas that have about one unit of precipitation to every 16 units of evapotranspiration 
  (the ratio that is characteristic of drylands; Noble and Gitay, 1996). They 
  often are referred to as "pulse systems" (Noble and Gitay, 1996). 
</p>
<p>In many countries, human activities in rangelands have evolved in response 
  to variable and often unpredictable climate. Human practices include pastoralism; 
  subsistence farming (Allen-Diaz, 1996); and, more recently, commercial ranching 
  (Canziani and Diaz, 1998). Rangelands also are important for many national economies 
  in terms of foreign cash (e.g., through tourism). They are important stores 
  of biodiversity, including ancestors of many of the cereals (World Bank, 1995), 
  and have high levels of endemism (Barnard et al., 1998). Rangelands are used 
  primarily for grazing and hence livestock production (Squires and Sidahmed, 
  1997). Thus, they are important for food (mostly livestock, but also wild fruits), 
  fuelwood, wood poles for construction, and feed (Campbell et al., 1997). Other 
  key services are biodiversity, water cycle, and carbon stores. Some of these 
  products and services can be given economic valuation; however, only a small 
  component of the total economic value is represented by products that can be 
  given a market value (Campbell et al., 1997), which suggests that nonmarket 
  values are quite important for some rangelands. </p>
<p>Rangelands are adapted to grazing and other disturbances, such as fire, flood, 
  and insect herbivory (Allen-Diaz, 1996). Vegetation tends to be sparse and thus 
  is not considered worth mechanical harvesting; however, the sparse grass/herbaceous 
  cover is efficiently harvested by grazers (Williams, 1986). In many cases, episodic 
  fires (Bock et al., 1995) are important for providing new and lush growth for 
  grazers, and fire sometimes is used to manage grass-woody shrub balance (Noble 
  et al., 1996), which is important for livestock and meat and wool production 
  (see, e.g., <a href="463.htm">Chapter 12</a>). Human management can be critical 
  to the status of these systems with or without climate change. Previous IPCC 
  reports concluded that fluctuating rainfall and temperatures along with increased 
  human activity (especially in more tropical systems) has led to land degradation 
  and eventually desertification in many areas (Bullock and Le Hou&eacute;rou, 
  1996; Gitay and Noble, 1996; Canziani and Diaz, 1998). </p>
<p>In this section, food/fiber, biodiversity, and carbon stores are examined in 
  detail (see <a href="202.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>). Water as a resource is considered 
  elsewhere in the report, at the global level (Chapter 4) and in many of the 
  regional chapters (<a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="463.htm">12</a>).</p>
