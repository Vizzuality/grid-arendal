<h3>6.3.4. Marine Fish </h3>
<p>Climatic factors affect the biotic and abiotic elements that influence the 
  numbers and distribution of fish species. Among the abiotic factors are water 
  temperature, salinity, nutrients, sea level, current conditions, and amount 
  of sea ice&#151;all of which are likely to be affected by climate change. Biotic 
  factors include food availability and the presence and species composition of 
  competitors and predators. Clearly the relationship between climatic factors 
  and the fish-carrying capacity of the marine environment is complicated, although 
  water temperature can be used as a basis for forecasting the abundance and distribution 
  of many species (Lehodey <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Water temperature also can have 
  a direct effect on spawning and survival of larvae and juveniles as well as 
  on fish growth, by acting on physiological processes. Sea temperature also affects 
  the biological production rate thus food availability in the ocean, which is 
  a powerful regulator of fish abundance and distribution.</p>
<p>The question of large-scale, long-term fluctuations in the abundance of marine 
  organisms, primarily those of considerable commercial importance, recently has 
  gained attention. Research has shown that variations (with cycles of 10-60 
  years or more) in the biomass volume of marine organisms depend on sea temperature 
  and climate (Ware, 1995). Examples include periodic fluctuations in the climate 
  and hydrographic regime of the Barents Sea, which have been reflected in variations 
  in commercial production over the past 100 years. Similarly, in the northwest 
  Atlantic Ocean results of fishing for cod during a period of 300 years (1600-1900) 
  showed a clear correlation between water temperature and catch, which also involved 
  changes in the population structure of cod over cycles of 50-60 years. 
  Shorter term variations in North Sea cod have been related to a combination 
  of overfishing and warming over the past 10 years (O'Brien <i>et al.</i>, 
  2000).</p>
<p>From 1987 to 1996, the world catch of all marine fishes averaged 74.5 Mt. From 
  1987 to 1993, catches were relatively stable, ranging between 71.6 and 75.9 
  Mt. There was a small increase over the period 1994-1996, ranging from 
  77.1 to 78.6 Mt (FAO, 1998). The 10 species with the largest landings represented 
  37.4% of the catch in 1996 and the next 10 species an additional 10.9%. Fluctuations 
  in abundance of species representing the 10 largest landings often have been 
  considered to result from overfishing and occasionally from a combination of 
  ocean environment changes and fishing effects. However, there is increasing 
  evidence to suggest that the impacts of climate variations are also having an 
  important effect (O'Brien <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>

      <p>As the figure to the left shows, catches (Mt) of Pacific salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus 
        sp.</i>) and sardines (<i>Sardinops sp.</i>) fluctuate synchronously with large-scale 
        climate-ocean changes in the North Pacific, as indicated by the Aleutian 
        Low Pressure Index and SST as expressed in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
        both of which are shown as a 5-year running average (data from Beamish 
        <i>et al.</i>, 1999, and Mantua <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Persistent states or regimes are 
        separated by regime shifts, which occurred about 1947, 1976-1977, 
        and 1989. These shifts are shown by the vertical dashed lines. The well-documented 
        1976-1977 regime shift has been associated with changing abundance 
        trends of other marine organisms such as plankton. It also has been related 
        to an abrupt change in the southernmost extent of sea ice in the Bering 
        Sea, in turn affecting the distribution of Walleye pollock (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>) 
        and Arctic cod (<i>Boreogadus saida</i>) (Wyllie-Echeverria and Wooster, 1998).</p>
      <p>The concepts of regimes, regime shifts, and natural trends in the abundance 
        of animals indicates that it is important to assess the potential impact 
        of global warming on decadal-scale processes as well as on species specific 
        responses.</p>

<p>The collapse of the Peruvian anchovy (<i>Engraulis ringens</i>) fishery from 
  the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s was widely accepted as an example of overfishing 
  and poor management. The increases in recent years, to catches slightly smaller 
  than the large catches prior to the collapse, provide an example of the important 
  impact of natural fluctuations and the difficulty of sorting out the impacts 
  of fishing and climate-ocean-induced changes. Caddy and Rodhouse (1998) reported 
  an increase in world cephalopod landings as world marine fish catches stabilized. 
  These increases were believed to be related to reduced predation from overfishing 
  of groundfish stocks, although warmer oceans were considered an important factor. 
  These examples emphasize the importance of considering the ecosystem impacts 
  of climate variations, as well as changes for individual species.</p>
<p>McGowan <i>et al.</i> (1998) show that there are large-scale biological responses 
  in the ocean to climate variations. Off California, the climate-ocean regime 
  shift in 1976-1977 (Ebbesmeyer <i>et al.</i>, 1991) resulted in a reduced 
  rate of supply of nutrients to a shallower mixing layer, decreasing productivity 
  and zooplankton and causing reductions in kelp and sea birds. Although there 
  is no question that fishing has impacts on the dynamics of fish populations, 
  the recent evidence of climate-related impacts is beginning to confound past 
  interpretations of fishing effects. McGowan <i>et al.</i> (1998) point out that 
  the success of future fish stock assessments would depend, to a large extent, 
  on the ability to predict the impacts of climate change on the dynamics of marine 
  ecosystems. The assumption that marine ecosystems are stable is no longer acceptable, 
  which raises questions about the definition of sustained yield (O'Brien 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>Weather impacts and seasonal rhythms have long been recognized by the global 
  fishing industry, but decadal-scale regime changes have been acknowledged only 
  recently as a factor in fish and ocean ecosystem dynamics. The concept of distinct 
  states in climate-ocean environments, which after periods of persistence switch 
  abruptly to other states, have been called regimes and regime shifts, respectively. 
  More formally, regimes (Steele, 1996) can be defined as multi-year periods of 
  linked recruitment patterns in fish populations or as a stable mean in physical 
  data. A regime shift is a change in the mean of a data series. The existence 
  of decadal-scale regimes in the environment has been documented (e.g., Gargett, 
  1997; Gu and Philander, 1997; Mantua <i>et al.</i>, 1997). States even longer 
  than the decadal-scale may exist (Ware, 1995; Marsh <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Adkinson 
  <i>et al.</i> (1996) and Beamish <i>et al.</i> (1997) have documented a large-scale 
  response in fish populations to regimes and regime shifts for Pacific salmon.</p>
<p>Among the most important groups of marine fishes are herrings (<i>Clupea sp.</i>), 
  sardines and pilchards (<i>Sardinops sp.</i>), and anchovies (<i>Engraulis sp.</i>) 
  (see <a href="#tab6-1">Table 6-1</a>). These fish tend to be short-lived species 
  that mature at an early age. Large fluctuations in abundance have been associated 
  with changes in the climate-ocean environment, although it has not been possible 
  to discover the mechanisms that link climate-ocean changes to recruitment (Cole 
  and McGlade, 1998). One of the most convincing relationships of large-scale, 
  synchronous responses in major fisheries resulting from changes in climate-ocean 
  states exists for sardine (<i>Sardinops sp.</i>). The decadal variability in 
  the Japanese sardine catch was synchronous with decadal-scale variability in 
  the ocean and climate of the North Pacific; these phenomena also were synchronous 
  with the fluctuations of sardine catches off Chile and California (Kawasaki, 
  1991; Hiyama <i>et al.</i>, 1995) and with trends in Pacific salmon catches 
  (Beamish <i>et al.</i>, 1999) (see <a href="#box6-1">Box 6-1</a>).</p>

<p>Fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>) 
  and sardine (<i>Sadinella pilchardus</i>) in the North and Baltic Seas have 
  been linked to variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the resulting 
  strength and pattern of southwesterly winds (Alheit and Hagen, 1997).</p>
<p>Most fishing regime changes can be related directly to sea-temperature changes, 
  but changes in other physical attributes also can have an impact. For instance, 
  a decrease in wind stress off Tasmania that reduced large zooplankton production 
  affected the density of Jack mackerel (Trachurus declivis), which eliminated 
  the possibility of a commercially viable mackerel fishery (Harris <i>et al.</i>, 
  1992).</p>

      <p>Skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) dominate the world's catch of 
        tuna. The habitat supporting the densest concentrations of skipjack is 
        the western equatorial Pacific warm pool, with SST of 29&deg;C and warmer. 
        Panel (a) clearly shows the association of skipjack tuna catch (shaded 
        and cross-hatched areas indicate January-June catch of 200,000+ t) 
        and mean SST [data from Lehodey <i>et al.</i> (1997)]. The figure also shows 
        that the location of the warm pool is linked to ENSO and that it changes 
        during El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a events. For instance, the catch 
        area in the first half of 1989 (La Ni&ntilde;a period), which is shown 
        by cross-hatch, was centered around Palau and the Federated States of 
        Micronesia; in the first half of 1992 (El Ni&ntilde;o period), the center 
        of abundance had shifted to the east, to the Marshall Islands and Kiribati 
        (shown by shading).</p>
      <p>Panels (b) and (c) indicate the scale of tuna migration during a La Ni&ntilde;a 
        period and an El Ni&ntilde;o period, respectively. These figures were 
        compiled from records of a large-scale skipjack tagging program carried 
        out by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The illustrations 
        are from Lehodey <i>et al.</i> (1997, 1998).</p>
      <p>The close association of skipjack tuna catch and ENSO is evidence that 
        climate variability profoundly affects the distribution pattern of tuna 
        and resulting fishing opportunities. Scientists do not know how projected 
        climate changes will affect the size and location of the warm pool in 
        the western and central Pacific, but if more El Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions 
        occur an easterly shift in the center of tuna abundance may become more 
        persistent.</p>

<p>The aforementioned climate-related fluctuations in the Japanese sardine occurred 
  at the same time as shifts in the migratory patterns of the northern bluefin 
  tuna (<i>Thunnus thynnus</i>), with a higher proportion of bluefin remaining 
  in the western Pacific when sardine abundance was high (Polovina, 1996). The 
  migratory pattern of albacore tuna (T. alalunga) also was altered by decadal-scale 
  climate changes (Kimura <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<p>Nearly 70% of the world's annual tuna harvest comes from the Pacific Ocean. 
  In 1996, Skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) was the eighth-largest marine 
  fishery in the world (see <a href="#tab6-1">Table 6-1</a>). Catches of skipjack 
  are highest in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool; Lehodey <i>et al.</i> 
  (1997) have shown that major spatial shifts in the skipjack population can be 
  linked to large zonal displacements of the warm pool (see <a href="#box6-2">Box 
  6-2</a>).</p>
<p>Welch <i>et al.</i> (1998) propose that continued warming of the North Pacific 
  Ocean would compress the distributions of Sockeye salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>), 
  essentially squeezing them out of the North Pacific and into the Bering Sea. 
  Some modeling of future impacts of greenhouse gas increases, however, has shown 
  an intensification of the Aleutian Low, which has been associated with mid-ocean 
  cooling (Deser <i>et al.</i>, 1996) and increased Pacific salmon production. 
  The warmer surface waters could reduce growth if bioenergetic costs are higher 
  and less food is available as a consequence of ocean habitat changes. The potential 
  impact of climate change on Pacific salmon is expected to occur in freshwater 
  and ocean situations (Hinch <i>et al.</i>, 1995). This fact is important because 
  production of more juveniles in hatcheries would not mitigate changes in the 
  ocean carrying capacity for Pacific salmon. The most effective strategy to manage 
  the impacts of climate change on Pacific salmon may be to ensure that wild salmon 
  are preserved and protected, rather than to produce more salmon through artificial 
  enhancement. It is possible that the variety of life history types and genetic 
  traits of the wild stocks are inherent biological solutions to changing freshwater 
  and marine habitats (Bisbal and McConnaha, 1998).</p>
<p>The potential deepening of the Aleutian Low and increase in the amplitude of 
  the Pacific Decadal Oscillation would result in major changes in marine ecosystems 
  (Mantua <i>et al.</i>, 1997). As ecosystems change, there may be impacts on 
  the distribution and survival of fishes. Any changes in natural mortality would 
  be associated with increased predation and other factors such as disease. Improved 
  growth in the early life stages would improve survival, whereas decreased growth 
  could facilitate increased mortality.</p>
<p>Sea temperature is an important regulator of fish behaviors. Wood and McDonald 
  (1997) provide examples of how climate change could induce temperature responses 
  in fish, but there are several areas where less certainty exists. The effect 
  that global climate change will have on trends in the Aleutian Low Pressure 
  system in the Pacific Ocean is an example. Although there are clear linkages 
  between the intensity and position of the low and production trends of many 
  of the commercially important fish species (Kawasaki <i>et al.</i>, 1991; Polovina 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Gargett, 1997; Mantua <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Francis <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1998), a reduction in equator-to-pole temperature gradients would probably 
  weaken winds and consequently reduce open-ocean upwelling. Important changes 
  in species distributions in surface waters could result.</p>
<p>There is now a cautious acceptance that climate change will have major positive 
  and negative impacts on the abundance and distribution of marine fish. Thus, 
  the impacts of fishing and climate change will affect the dynamics of fish and 
  shellfish such as abalone in Mexico (Shepherd <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Fishing 
  impacts may be particularly harmful if natural declines in productivity occur 
  without corresponding reductions in exploitation rates. Changes in fish distributions 
  and the development of aquaculture may reduce the value of some species, however&#151;as 
  it has for wild Pacific salmon&#151;and these changes may reduce fishing pressures 
  in some areas. </p>
<p>Key to understanding the direction of change for world fisheries is the ability 
  to incorporate decadal-scale variability into general circulation models (GCMs). 
  Although progress has occurred, it still is not possible to assess regional 
  responses to shifts in climate trends, and it is unknown if a general warming 
  will increase or decrease the frequency and intensity of decadal-scale changes 
  in regions where national fisheries occur. Recent studies have not produced 
  evidence to change the conclusion from the SAR (Everett <i>et al.</i>, 1996) 
  that future saltwater fisheries production is likely to be about the same as 
  at present, though changes in distribution could affect who catches a particular 
  stock. However, if aquaculture becomes the major source of fish flesh and management 
  of fisheries becomes more precautionary, the exploitation rate of wild marine 
  fish may decrease in some areas.</p>
