        <b>Figure 8-6:</b>Regional insurance coverage for weather- and non-weather-related 
        natural disasters, 1985-1999. The role of insurance in paying weather-related 
        losses varies by event type and region, generally dominated by windstorm 
        (Munich Re, 1999b). "Other" includes weather-related events 
        such as wildfire, landslides, land subsidence,avalanches, extreme temperature 
        events, droughts, lightning, frost, and ice/snow damages (Munich Re, 2000). 
        The numbers generally include "captive" self-insurers but not 
        the less-formal types of self-insurance. Total costs are higher than those 
        summarized in Figure 8-1 because of the restriction ofFigure 8-1 losses 
        to those from large catastrophic events. Rounding errors may appear in 
        data labels.</p>

<p><a name="fig86"></a>For insurers, vulnerability can be viewed broadly in terms 
  of the sector's capacity to pay for extreme events, together with the temporal 
  sequence of such events. The key to vulnerability is the probable maximum loss 
  (PML), which is the best estimate of the cost that is likely to emanate from 
  an event with a specified probability of occurrence. In recent times, PMLs often 
  have been revised upward significantly. The European winter storms Lothar and 
  Martin of 1999 (US$8.4 billion insured losses) caught European insurers and 
  reinsurers offguard, presenting losses that substantially exceeded prevailing 
  expectations. These storms constituted the most serious natural disaster ever 
  covered by insurance in France, with about 3 million claims (FFSA, 2000). One 
  recent estimate for the United States was a combined PML of US$155 billion for 
  1-in-100-year (i.e., 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> likelihood) for all types of natural disasters 
  nationally (see <a href="578.htm#fig158">Figure 15-8</a>). </p>
<p>Unnewehr (1999) segmented the market and estimated that 17% of 1997 U.S. P/C 
  insurance premiums were associated with "significant" exposure to 
  weather-related loss. The paper did not explore other measures or sources of 
  vulnerability and exposure, such as total insured property values at risk (US$4 
  trillion in insured property in the Gulf and Atlantic coastal counties of the 
  United States) (Hooke, 2000), or the extent of insolvency risk. These results 
  are not transferable to other regions, where insurance systems and natural hazards 
  can be very unlike those in the United States (see <a href="#fig86">Figure 8-6</a>).</p>
<p>The particular role of weather in vehicle-related losses is not well studied. 
  Vehicle insurance represents 48% of U.S. P/C premiums; it is ranked in the aforementioned 
  study as having "minor" weather sensitivity. Of total vehicle-related 
  accidents, 16% of those in the United States are caused by adverse weather conditions 
  (NHTSA, 1999); 33% of those in Canada are weather related (White and Etkin, 
  1997). Physical damage to vehicles during U.S. natural catastrophes between 
  1996 and mid-2000 represented an additional $3.4 billion (10%) of total insured 
  property losses, ranging as high as 55% for individual events (PCS, 2000; Mills 
  <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
<p>Although aggregate industry assessments are useful, analyses of vulnerability 
  clearly must take into account the complexity and specialized structure of the 
  insurance sector (GAO, 2000a). Although an <i>aggregate</i> U.S. insurance surplus 
  of US$200-350 billion often is cited (Doherty, 1997; GAO, 2000a), roughly 
  80% of this surplus is required for non-weather-sensitive branches (e.g., workers' 
  compensation), assuming proportionality with premium-based risk figures quoted 
  by Unnewehr (1999). In addition, insurers are independent and have radically 
  different mixes of risks, so individual firms may become insolvent long before 
  losses approach the industry's aggregate capacity (Doherty, 1997; Klein, 
  1997). Single-state PML events at the 1% likelihood level would result in economic 
  stress ranging from 5 to 60% of insurers by market share (Pullen, 1999b). Moreover, 
  catastrophes can disrupt insurance markets and harm insurance companies and 
  consumers even in cases in which all claims are paid (GAO, 2000a; Ryland, 2000). 
</p>
<p>Reinsurance adequacy is another issue in vulnerability assessment. Swiss Re 
  (1997) concluded that the availability of reinsurance coverage for natural disasters 
  in 14 major markets was insufficient and that following a major event, primary 
  insurers' (the customers of reinsurers) equity base (surplus) would come 
  under considerable strain. For PML windstorm events in Australia, Japan, and 
  the United States, the impact on aggregate surplus would be reductions of 24, 
  41, and 11%, respectively (Swiss Re, 1997). Solvency analyses typically give 
  only "partial credit" to primary insurers for reinsurance (e.g., 50% 
  in the European Union) because of the uncertain viability of reinsurance contracts 
  or reinsurers themselves following catastrophic losses (Doherty <i>et al</i>., 
  1992; Swiss Re, 2000a).</p>
<p>Aside from issues of solvency, past extreme weather events clearly have measurable 
  short- to medium-term impacts on insurance and reinsurance profitability&#151;even 
  at a national scale (<a href="329.htm#fig84">Figure 8-4a</a>) and on the availability 
  of insurance following the event (Davidson 1996; Pullen, 1999b). Catastrophe 
  losses during 1999 and 2000 contributed to marked short-term depressions in 
  earnings and stock prices for several large insurers and reinsurers (Edgecliffe-Johnson, 
  1999; Carpenter, 2000; Lonkevich, 2000). This development can restrict insurers' 
  ability to raise new capital for expansion or even to continue the operations 
  of highly exposed branches.</p>
<p>The overarching insurance business environment also is a key factor in determining 
  vulnerability. Cyclical pressures or incidental broad-based stresses on the 
  industry&#151;such as major tobacco litigation (Bradford, 2000; Clow, 2000; 
  Hofmann, 2000a), the crisis in environmental liability insurance (U.S. Superfund, 
  asbestos, and lead paint claims), the Asian financial crisis, or increased competition 
  from Internet sales (Ceniceros, 2000)&#151;could place considerable demands 
  on surplus (Mooney, 1999; GAO, 2000a; Swiss Re, 1998b, 2000a). Developments 
  in financial markets can influence the level and availability of insurance surplus 
  (Cummins <i>et al.</i>, 1999; GAO, 2000b; Swiss Re, 2000a). More than three-quarters 
  of the growth in the U.S. insurance industry's surplus since 1995 resulted 
  from capital gains (GAO, 2000a).</p>
<p>On one hand, the trend toward convergence between banking and insurance potentially 
  increases diversification and robustness. On the other hand, it exposes one 
  sector to risks faced in the other, and, in some cases, geographical diversification 
  of a company's insurance business has moved it into the path of increased 
  disaster losses (Berry, 2000; Greenwald, 2000; Howard, 2000b; Lonkevich, 2000). 
  Weather-related vulnerability could increase if insurers participate in emerging 
  capital market alternatives for risk financing (Marcon, 1999). In general, such 
  convergence is more likely for the life insurance segment</p>
