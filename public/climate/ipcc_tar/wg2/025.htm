<h2>2.2. Anticipating the Effects of Future Climate Change </h2>
<p><i>Since the SAR, improvements in methods and tools for studying impacts of 
  future changes in climate have included greater emphasis on the use of process-oriented 
  models, transient climate change scenarios, refined socioeconomic baselines, 
  and higher resolution spatial and temporal scales.</i> Country studies and regional 
  assessments in every continent have tested models and tools in a variety of 
  contexts. First-order impact models have been linked to global systems models. 
  Adaptation has been included in many assessments, often for the first time. 
</p>
<p><i>Methodological gaps remain concerning scales, data, validation, and integration 
  of adaptation and the human dimensions of climate change.</i> Procedures for 
  assessing regional and local vulnerability and long-term adaptation strategies 
  require high-resolution assessments, methodologies to link scales, and dynamic 
  modeling that uses corresponding and new data sets. Validation at different 
  scales often is lacking. Regional integration across sectors is required to 
  place vulnerability in the context of local and regional development. Methods 
  and tools to assess vulnerability to extreme events have improved but are constrained 
  by low confidence in climate change scenarios and the sensitivity of impact 
  models to major climatic anomalies. Understanding and integrating higher order 
  economic effects and other human dimensions of global change are required. Adaptation 
  models and vulnerability indices to prioritize adaptation options are at early 
  stages of development in many fields. Methods to enable stakeholder participation 
  in assessments need improvement. [<a href="080.htm">2.3</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="23"></a>2.3. Integrated Assessment</h2>
<p>Integrated assessment is an interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets, 
  and communicates knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines from the natural 
  and social sciences to investigate and understand causal relationships within 
  and between complicated systems. Methodological approaches employed in such 
  assessments include computer-aided modeling, scenario analyses, simulation gaming 
  and participatory integrated assessment, and qualitative assessments that are 
  based on existing experience and expertise. Since the SAR, significant progress 
  has been made in developing and applying such approaches to integrated assessment, 
  globally and regionally. </p>
<p><i>However, progress to date, particularly with regard to integrated modeling, 
  has focused largely on mitigation issues at the global or regional scale and 
  only secondarily on issues of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation.</i> Greater 
  emphasis on the development of methods for assessing vulnerability is required, 
  especially at national and subnational scales where impacts of climate change 
  are felt and responses are implemented. Methods designed to include adaptation 
  and adaptive capacity explicitly in specific applications must be developed.
