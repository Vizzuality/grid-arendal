<h4>5.7.3.4.2. Heterogeneity in response</h4>
<p>Responses of lakes and streams to climate change are spatially heterogeneous. 
  Much of the local heterogeneity depends on the type of water body being considered: 
  lake or stream, large or small, shallow or deep, eutrophic or oligotrophic, 
  and so forth. Spatial heterogeneity also results from spatial differences in 
  climate drivers themselves with latitude, altitude, and distance from the coast 
  or a large lake. Inappropriate responses with large expenditures of local resources 
  will result unless the spatial heterogeneity of local responses is understood 
  and can be predicted. </p>
<p>Two ideas that help explain local heterogeneity in responses of lakes and streams 
  to climate change from a landscape perspective are the stream continuum (Vannote 
  et al., 1980; Minshall et al., 1985) and the position of a lake in the landscape 
  (Kratz et al., 1991; Kratz et al., 1997; Magnuson and Kratz, 2000; Riera et 
  al., 2000). Both concepts are geomorphic legacies resulting from the location 
  of the water body in the hydrologic flow field. Headwater streams will be more 
  shielded from warming relative to lowland streams because cool groundwater sources 
  are more important; in forest catchments, they are more shaded from radiation, 
  and in mountain catchments they are at higher, cooler altitudes (Hauer et al., 
  1997). For lakes, changes in chemical inputs with changes in rainfall will be 
  greater in upland lakes than in lowland lakes. Upland lakes are supplied more 
  by dilute precipitation than by solute-rich groundwater or overland flow. The 
  chemistry of headwater lakes is extremely responsive to climate-driven changes 
  in groundwater inputs because they tend to have smaller volumes and shorter 
  residence times (Krabbenhoft and Webster, 1995). </p>
<p>Differences in the extent of connected wetlands or other sources of DOC contribute 
  to local heterogeneity in responses. Export of DOC to lakes and streams increases 
  in wetter times and decreases during drought. This, in turn, changes light penetration 
  and vertical distribution of solar heating and, in lakes, the depth of thermocline 
  and the relative magnitude of cold and warm thermal habitat for fish (Schindler 
  et al., 1996b). Penetration of UV-B, thus the damaging effects of that radiation 
  (Schindler, 1997), also will differ among lakes. Lakes without large sources 
  of DOC that leach in during wetter periods will respond less to climate changes 
  in these respects.</p>
<p>Shorter term, more stochastic patterns in catchments alter the behavior of 
  lake ecosystems. Consider a drought that increases the likelihood of forest 
  fires in the watersheds of boreal lakes in Ontario (Schindler, 1997). Burned 
  areas typically are patchy and may or may not include the catchment of a given 
  lake. If they do include the lake's watershed, there is an initial increase 
  in the input of solutes to streams and the lake. The lake also is under greater 
  influence of wind mixing with trees gone, which would deepen the thermocline 
  and again alter the relative magnitude of cold and warm thermal habitat for 
  fish.</p>
<p>Predicted responses of threatened anadromous Pacific salmonid stocks in the 
  Columbia basin of the northwestern United States are varied. Climate-related 
  factors that are important to successful reproduction include temperature, the 
  river hydrograph (peak and annual flow), and sedimentation (Neitzel et al., 
  1991). Based on expected changes in these streams and 60 stocks across the basin, 
  impacts on 23% were judged to be negative, 37% positive, and 40% neutral.</p>
