<h2>1.2. What is Potentially at Stake?</h2>
<p>The stakes surrounding anthropogenic climate change can be very high in terms 
  of the vulnerabilities of some sectors and regions and in terms of the distributional 
  consequences of actions taken to deal with these possibilities. The context 
  is that humankind already is challenged today to provide the opportunity for 
  this and future generations to achieve a more sustainable and equitable standard 
  of living. Billions of people today live without adequate nourishment, access 
  to clean water, modern energy services, and other basic human needs (see, e.g., 
  UNDP, 1999). Providing for the increasing well-being of humans, especially the 
  poor, in the context of sustainable and equitable development is one of the 
  great challenges of the 21st century. Unabated climate change is likely to make 
  meeting this challenge significantly more difficult. On the other hand, it also 
  is argued (e.g., Grossman and Krueger, 1995) that increasing economic growth 
  may lead to reductions in population growth and environmental degradation. Throughout 
  the past century, however, per capita carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from combustion 
  of fossil fuels have been driven primarily by growth in gross domestic product 
  (GDP) per capita (although the growth rate in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions generally has not 
  been as fast as the growth in GDP, owing to improvements in energy and carbon 
  intensities of industrial economies (e.g., Hoffert et al., 1998). </p>
<p>The impact (I) of a given population on the environment can be decomposed into 
  the product of three factors: population size (P), affluence per capita (A), 
  and unit impact per unit of affluence, which is related to technologies used 
  (T) (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971; Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1990). Rising per capita 
  consumption and a growing world population have resulted in unprecedented human 
  resource use, which is altering global systems, including climate (Bartiaux 
  and van Ypersele, 1993; Yang and Schneider, 1998). According to all of the scenarios 
  considered in the IPCC's Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC, 
  2000), the human population will continue to grow until at least 2050, reaching 
  a population that is 60-100% larger than it was in 1990. The SRES scenarios 
  describe futures that generally are more affluent than today; many of the SRES 
  scenarios assume a narrowing of income differences (in relative but not absolute 
  terms) among world regions. This implies that the third factor in the "I=PAT" 
  identity, the unit impact per unit of affluence, will have a very important 
  role in assessment of the global impact of human activities. Increasing population 
  and affluence, if not accompanied by significant decreases in unit impact per 
  unit of affluence, will make the challenge of promoting sustainable development 
  even more difficult-particularly in developing countries, where most of the 
  increase in population is projected to take place. </p>
<p>We have reached the point that the cumulative interaction of several factors 
  related to human activities (e.g., land-use changes and emissions of GHGs, ozone-depleting 
  substances, and local air pollutants) increases the risk of causing or aggravating 
  potentially irreversible events, such as loss of species, forests, human settlements, 
  glaciers, or heritage sites near coastlines and, in the long term, altered oceanic 
  circulation regimes. </p>
<p>Although some regions may experience beneficial effects of climate change (e.g., 
  increasing agricultural productivity at high latitudes), previous IPCC assessments 
  have concluded that net negative climate impacts are more likely in most parts 
  of the world (assessment of potential positive and negative impacts is one of 
  the main purposes of this report; see <a href="102.htm">Sections 2.5.6</a> and 
  <a href="108.htm">2.6.4</a> and subsequent sections in this chapter for a discussion 
  of uses of and problems with net monetary aggregation of impacts, and see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 
  19</a> for a synthesis). These impacts will affect human welfare directly and 
  indirectly, in many cases undercutting efforts to promote sustainable development 
  that, in turn, serve as driving forces of environmental change. </p>
<p>Moreover, the time scales of change vary tremendously. For environmental systems, 
  these time scales range from decades (for restoration of slightly disturbed 
  ecosystems) to many centuries (for equilibration of the climate system and sea 
  level), even with a stable level of atmospheric GHG concentrations. These environmental 
  time scales imply that human activities in the short term will set in motion 
  a chain of events with long-term consequences for the climate that cannot be 
  reversed quickly, if at all. </p>
<p>For most human institutions, the time scales range from years for very short 
  electoral cycles that determine the tenure of a government to a half-century 
  or more for the useful lifetimes of buildings and major infrastructure such 
  as irrigation projects, transportation networks, or energy supply systems. It 
  may take a generation or more to effect significant changes to institutions. 
  Because of these time scales, some decisions taken during the next few decades 
  may limit the range of possible options in the future with respect to emissions 
  reduction and adaptation, whereas other decisions may expand this range of options. 
  During this period, many more insights into the effects and impacts of climatic 
  changes will emerge. However, it is well established that uncertainties will 
  remain, and efforts to manage risks in the face of considerable uncertainty 
  will be a characteristic of climatic change assessments for decades more. </p>
<p>Working Group II's contribution to the TAR focuses principally on the time 
  horizon reaching from the present to the year 2100-which reflects the preponderance 
  of studies on this time period in the literature and the high degree of uncertainty 
  about the state of socioenvironmental systems beyond the 21st century. By 2100, 
  most projections of human-induced climate change fall into ranges of about 1.4 
  to almost 5.8°C increase in annual global mean surface temperature (see <a href="../wg1/008.htm#figspm5">Figure 
  5d</a> in the <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/005.htm">Summary 
  for Policymakers</a>) compared to 1990 (although estimates that are outliers 
  to both ends of even this large range can be found in the literature; Morgan 
  and Keith, 1995) and about 10- to 90-cm rise in mean sea level (<a href="../wg1/008.htm#figspm5">Figure 
  5e</a>, <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/005.htm">Summary 
  for Policymakers</a>). By the time of doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent 
  concentration, the global mean precipitation is projected to be about 1-5% higher 
  than in 1990. These global numbers hide complex spatial patterns of changes 
  (especially for temperature and precipitation), which are summarized in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>. In some regions, temperature increases are projected to be three times 
  the global mean. In addition, high confidence is attached to "projected changes 
  in extreme weather and climatic events". Such changes, particularly at the higher 
  ends of the ranges given, represent significant deviations from the climatic 
  conditions of recent centuries. As noted above, warming of the climate and sea-level 
  rise would continue for centuries beyond 2100, even if atmospheric concentrations 
  of GHGs stabilize during the 21st century. For perspective, it should be noted 
  that since the early Miocene (about 24 million years ago), atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations appear to have remained below 500 ppmv (Pearson and Palmer, 2000). 
  If human emissions of GHG until 2100 remain at or-as in many scenarios in the 
  literature-increase well beyond current levels, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  will be significantly above this value. It can therefore be remarked that climate 
  changes in the 22nd century could exceed any experienced in more than 1 million 
  years (see, e.g., Crowley, 1990; Crowley and North, 1991). Indeed, these authors 
  estimate that global temperature was never significantly warmer than the present 
  during the past 2 million years and that one would need to return to the early 
  Pliocene (3-5 million years ago) or even the Miocene (5-25 million years ago) 
  to find a climate that is warmer than today by more than 2°C. The potential 
  impacts of these very large projected changes cannot be disregarded, even though 
  it is difficult to imagine what human societies would look like in the 22nd 
  century (see, e.g., Cline, 1992). However-reflecting the scarcity of studies 
  of climatic impacts beyond 2100, despite their potential relevance to Article 
  2 of the UNFCCC-these impacts are not a major focus in the TAR (although <a href="657.htm">Chapter 
  19</a> does focus on the possibilities of abrupt, nonlinear, and/or irreversible 
  climatic changes in the centuries ahead).</p>
