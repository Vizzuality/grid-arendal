<h2>19.6. Extreme and Irreversible Effects </h2>
<h3><a name="1961"></a>19.6.1. The Irregular Face of Climate Change</h3>
<p>Natura non facit saltus&#151;nature does not take jumps. Modern science has 
  thoroughly shattered this tenet of the Aristotelian school of thought. Long-term 
  observations and experimental insights have demonstrated convincingly that smooth, 
  or regular, behavior is an exception rather than a rule. Available records of 
  climate variability, for example, reveal sudden fluctuations of key variables 
  at all time scales. Large, abrupt climate changes evident in Greenland ice-core 
  records (known as Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations&#151;Dansgaard et al., 1993) 
  and episodic, massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic (known 
  as Heinrich events&#151;Bond et al., 1992) are obvious examples of irregular 
  behavior as a result of weak external forcing. Ecosystems also display discontinuous 
  responses to changing ambient conditions, such as changes in disturbance regimes 
  (Holling, 1992a; Peterson et al., 1998) and species extinctions (Pounds et al., 
  1999). Irreversible changes in ecosystems are triggered by disturbances (e.g., 
  Gill, 1998), pests (e.g., Holling, 1992b), and shifts in species distributions 
  (Huntley et al., 1997). Irregular behavior is accepted as a major aspect of 
  the dynamics of complex systems (Berry, 1978; Schuster, 1988; Wiggins, 1996; 
  Badii and Politi, 1997).</p>
<p>A quantitative entity behaves "irregularly" when its dynamics are 
  discontinuous, nondifferentiable, unbounded, wildly varying, or otherwise ill-defined. 
  Such behavior often is termed singular, particularly in catastrophe theory (Saunders, 
  1982), and illustrates how smooth variations of driving forces can cause abrupt 
  and drastic system responses. The occurrence, magnitude, and timing of singularities 
  are relatively difficult to predict, which is why they often are called "surprises" 
  in the literature.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that singular behavior is not restricted to natural 
  systems. There has been speculation, for example, about possible destabilization 
  of food markets, public health systems, and multilateral political agreements 
  on resource use, but solid evidence rarely has been provided (e.g., D&ouml;&ouml;s, 
  1994; Hsu, 1998). Rigorous scientific analysis of certain classes of singular 
  socioeconomic phenomena is emerging (Bunde and Schellnhuber, 2000), but huge 
  cognitive gaps remain in this field.</p>
<p>Singularities have large consequences for climate change vulnerability assessments. 
  Unfortunately, most of the vulnerability assessment literature still is focusing 
  on a smooth transition from what is assumed to be an equilibrium climate toward 
  another equilibrium climate (often 1xCO<sub>2</sub> to 2xCO<sub>2</sub>). This 
  means that most impact assessments still implicitly assume that climate change 
  basically is a "well-behaved" process. Until recently, only a few 
  authors have emphasized the importance of discontinuous, irreversible, and extreme 
  events to the climate problem (e.g., Lempert et al., 1994; Nordhaus, 1994a; 
  Schellnhuber, 1997); concerns about the impacts of these events and their consequences 
  for society now are becoming much more common. Singularities could lead to rapid, 
  large, and unexpected impacts on local, regional, and global scales. Anticipating 
  and adapting to such events and their impacts would be much more difficult than 
  responding to smooth change, even if these responses must be made in the face 
  of uncertainty. Furthermore, singularities considerably complicate the search 
  for optimal emissions reduction strategies that are based on, for example, benefit-cost 
  analysis or tolerable emissions strategies that are based on, as another example, 
  the precautionary principle. </p>
<p>This section reviews and synthesizes relevant available information on the 
  impacts of singular behavior of (components of) the climate system or singular 
  impacts of climate change and draws conclusions about the consequences for vulnerability 
  assessments. Because no generally accepted framework to assess singularities 
  of climate change exists, an illustrative typology of singularities is discussed 
  first. The different characteristics of each class in this typology justify 
  why insights from this section contribute to two separate reasons for concern: 
  extreme weather events and large-scale singularities.</p>
<h3><a name="1962"></a>19.6.2. Characteristics of Singularities</h3>
<p>The causes of singularities are diverse, but most can be grouped in the categories 
  of nonlinearity, complexity, and stochasticity. Choices about how to assess 
  singular climate impacts depend strongly on the factors generating such behavior. 
  The first two categories arise in a largely deterministic context, so their 
  incidence can be assessed with proper models. The latter is probabilistic, however, 
  rendering its incidence basically unpredictable. Only statistical properties 
  can be analyzed. Predictability (and consequently adaptability) is directly 
  related to the stochastic nature of the underlying dynamics. </p>
<p>The first, and most obvious, class of singularities is caused by strongly nonlinear 
  or discontinuous functional relationships. A conspicuous case is the critical 
  threshold, where responses to a continuous change in a driving variable bring 
  about sudden and severe impacts, such as extinction events. Changes in mean 
  climate can increase the likelihood of crossing these thresholds. Even one of 
  the simplest physical thresholds in the climate system&#151;the melting point 
  of ice&#151;could induce singular impacts. For example, thawing of permafrost 
  regions would be induced by only a few degrees of warming (Pavlov, 1997) and 
  would severely affect soil and slope stability, with disastrous effects on Arctic 
  infrastructure such as oil pipelines (see <a href="606.htm#1625">Section 16.2.5</a> 
  and SAR WGII Section 11.5.3). <a href="667.htm">Section 19.3</a> extensively 
  illustrates the occurrence of critical thresholds that are relevant for bleaching 
  of coral reefs (a temperature threshold) and coastal mangroves (a sea-level 
  rise threshold).</p>
<p>Complexity itself is a second potential cause for singular behavior in many 
  systems. Complex systems, of course, are composed of many elements that interact 
  in many different ways. Anomalies in driving forces of these systems generally 
  distort interactions between constituents of the system. Positive feedback loops 
  then can easily push the systems into a singular response. (Note that complexity 
  is by no means synonymous with nonlinearity!)</p>
<p>Complex interactions and feedbacks gradually have become a focal point of global 
  and climate change investigations: Several illustrative studies, for example, 
  deal with the interplay between atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, and vegetation 
  cover that brought about the rapid transition in the mid-Holocene from a "green" 
  Sahara to a desert (Brovkin et al., 1998; Ganopolski et al., 1998; Claussen 
  et al., 1999), with the mutual amplification of regional climate modification 
  and unsustainable use of tropical forests as mediated by fire (Cochrane, 1999; 
  Goldammer, 1999; Nepstad et al., 1999) and with the dramatic disruptions possibly 
  inflicted on Southern Ocean food webs and ecological services by krill depletion 
  resulting from dwindling sea-ice cover (see Brierly and Reid, 1999; see also 
  <a href="602.htm">Section 16.2.3</a>).</p>
<p>The third category, stochasticity, captures a class of singularities that are 
  triggered by exceptional events. In the climate context, these are, by definition, 
  extreme weather events such as cyclones and heavy rains (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>). Their occurrence is governed by a generally well-behaved statistical 
  distribution. The irregular character of extreme events stems mainly from the 
  fact that, although they reside in the far tails of this distribution, they 
  nonetheless occur from time to time. Therefore, they could affect downstream 
  systems by surprise and trigger effects that are vastly disproportional to their 
  strength. Climate change also could lead, however, to changes in probability 
  distributions for extreme events. Such changes actually could cause serious 
  problems because the risk and consequences of these transitions are difficult 
  to quantify and identify in advance. The impacts caused by these events have 
  not yet been explored, although they should constitute an essential aspect of 
  any impact and adaptation assessment.</p>
<p>The impacts of extreme event consequences of stochastic climate variability, 
  however, have begun to attract researchers' attention in a related context. 
  As noted in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>, changes in mean climate can increase 
  the likelihood that distributed weather will cross thresholds where the consequences 
  and impacts are severe and extreme. This variant of stochastic singularity therefore 
  can change in frequency even if the probability of extreme weather events, measured 
  against the mean, is unaffected by long-term trends.</p>
<p>There also is a fourth type that generally arises from a combination of all 
  other singularity categories. This type&#151;sometimes referred to as "imaginable 
  surprises" (Schneider et al., 1998; see also <a href="054.htm">Chapter 
  1</a>)&#151;represents conceivable global or regional disruptions of the operational 
  mode of the Earth system. Such macro-discontinuities may cause damages to natural 
  and human systems that exceed the negative impacts of "ordinary" disasters 
  by several orders of magnitudes.</p>
<p>Responses to climate change can alter their character from singular to regular&#151;and 
  vice versa&#151;as they cascade down the causal chain: geophysical perturbations, 
  environmental impacts, sectoral and socioeconomic impacts, and societal responses. 
  Only the last three are climate change effects in the proper sense, but the 
  first is important because it translates highly averaged indicators of climate 
  change into the actual trigger acting at the relevant scale. Most singular geophysical 
  perturbations create singular impacts&#151;which may, in turn, activate singular 
  responses. One therefore might assume that singularities tend to be preserved 
  down such a cascade. Singular events also can arise further down the causal 
  chain. Purely regular geophysical forcing, for example, can cause singular impacts, 
  and singular socioeconomic responses may result from regular impacts. </p>
<p>Harmful impacts of climate change generally can be alleviated by adaptation 
  or exacerbated by mismanagement (see, e.g., West and Dowlatabadi, 1999; Schneider 
  et al., 2000a; see also <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>). Climate-triggered 
  singular phenomena can generate substantial impacts because their predictability 
  and manageability are low. Such impacts would be considerably reduced if they 
  could be "regularized" by appropriate measures. For example, an ingenious array 
  of seawalls and dikes could transform an extreme storm surge into a mundane 
  inundation that could be controlled by routine contingency procedures. So too 
  could a long-term policy of retreat from the sea. However, inappropriate flood 
  control structures could wreak havoc, particularly because they foster a false 
  sense of security and actually inspire further coastal development.</p>
<p>In summary, singularities tend to produce singularities, as a rule; regularities 
  may turn into singularities under specific conditions, and singularities can 
  be regularized by autonomous ecological processes or judicious societal measures. 
  Defining the propagation of singular events in the causal cascade or opportunities 
  to convert them into regular events remains a major research challenge.</p>
