<h2>7.2. State of Knowledge Regarding Climate Change Impacts on Human Populations 
</h2>
<p>The TAR differs from the two previous assessments in that the literature has 
  begun to quantify several of the climate-related risks to human settlements 
  that previously were identified only in qualitative terms. Additional attention 
  and research has been devoted to adaptation mechanisms that provide resistance 
  to climate-related impacts and ability to recover from them. Several economic 
  and social trends that are specific to development and change in human settlements 
  will interact with the effects of climate change in the future and may exacerbate 
  or mitigate the effects of climate change alone. </p>
<h3><a name="721"></a>7.2.1. Nonclimate Trends Affecting Vulnerability to Climate 
</h3>
<p>Population growth: Except for parts of Europe and the Russian Federation, most 
  regions are expected to experience population growth. Although Special Report 
  on Emission Scenarios (SRES) marker scenarios in Chapter 3 do not span the entire 
  realm of possibilities and have not been assigned probabilities, they do show 
  that under plausible conditions, future regional population growth rates will 
  range from modest (Europe and North America, where projected rates are just 
  above or below replacement) to 3% or more (portions of Latin America and especially 
  Africa). </p>
<p>Urbanization (proportion of population living in urban areas) is expected to 
  continue, especially in the developing world. Close to half of the world's population 
  now lives in urban areas, and the likely trend toward a more urban world means 
  that the impacts of climate change on human settlements, if they occur, increasingly 
  will affect urban populations. The most rapid urban growth rates are occurring 
  in the developing world, where urban populations are estimated to be growing 
  at 2.7% yr<sup>-1</sup>, compared to 0.5% yr<sup>-1</sup> in more developed 
  regions (UN, 2000). There also is a growing concentration of population in cities 
  with more than 1 million inhabitants. The number of such cities worldwide grew 
  from 80 in 1950 to more than 300 by 1990 and is expected to exceed 500 by 2010 
  (UNCHS, 1996; UN, 2000). Most cities with more than 1 million inhabitants are 
  now in the developing world, although-as in more developed regions-they are 
  heavily concentrated in its largest economies (UNCHS, 1996). Cities also are 
  reaching unprecedented sizes. However, the future world may be less dominated 
  by "megacities" (cities of more than 10 million population) than previously 
  predicted. Megacities are likely to be smaller than previously predicted and 
  still contain a small proportion of the world's population-less than 4% in 1990, 
  the last date for which there is census data for most nations (UNCHS, 1996; 
  UN, 2000). Most of the world's urban population live in the 40,000-50,000 urban 
  centers with fewer than 1 million inhabitants (UNCHS, 1996). In 1990, cities 
  with more than 1 million inhabitants had just more than one-third of the world's 
  urban population and just more than one-seventh of its total population (UN, 
  2000). Urban population increases were particularly sharp in the second half 
  of the 20th century in some regions where urbanization had been held down by 
  policy, such as China (Institute of Land Development and Regional Economy, State 
  Planning Committee, 1998). Trends toward urbanization mean that the impacts 
  of climate change on human settlements in most countries, if they occur, increasingly 
  will affect urban populations, not rural or traditional settlements. </p>

<p>Poverty is becoming increasingly urbanized, as a growing proportion of the 
  population suffering from absolute poverty lives in urban areas. In more developed 
  regions and in much of Latin America (e.g., 36% in Latin America-ECLAC, 2000), 
  poverty is concentrated in urban areas. In other regions, the number of rural 
  poor still exceeds the number of urban poor, although the proportion of absolute 
  poor living in urban areas is growing. In addition, the scale and depth of urban 
  poverty frequently is underestimated, in part because official income-based 
  poverty lines are set too low in relation to the cost of living (or the income 
  needed to avoid deprivation) in most urban centers and in part because no provision 
  is made to include housing conditions, access to services, assets, and aspects 
  of social exclusion within most government poverty definitions (Satterthwaite 
  1997). Where it occurs, urban poverty reduces the capacity of urban populations 
  to take action to adapt to climate change; poverty also may exacerbate many 
  of its effects. </p>
<p>Market systems and privatization increasingly are being used to provide new 
  infrastructure and maintain older systems (World Bank, 1994), giving government 
  a smaller direct role in providing infrastructure for energy, environmental 
  residuals, communications, and other key urban services. Governments that are 
  trying to adapt settlements to climate change increasingly may have to work 
  indirectly through markets and regulation of private providers to adapt buildings 
  and infrastructure to climate change. </p>
<p>Energy systems are changing in some places, helping to determine which mechanisms 
  are salient in human settlements impacts (Schipper and Meyers, 1992; Hall et 
  al., 1993; World Energy Council, 1993a): </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Use of biomass fuels for cooking and space heating in many developing countries 
    remains significant, which has added to deforestation and environmental destruction 
    in some places but not others (Leach and Mearns, 1989; Tiffen and Mortimore, 
    1992). Biomass growth may be stimulated by warming, if precipitation remains 
    adequate, but may fall otherwise. <br>
  <li>The increase in natural gas use in Europe and North America (and nuclear 
    power in France) over the past 2 decades has held down the rate of use of 
    coal and oil and has reduced coal use by 20% in western Europe. Accelerated 
    coal use is expected in developing Asia (EIA, 1998). Much of the increase 
    is related to increasing electricity demand, which would be compounded by 
    climate warming. <br>
  <li>An increasing market share for electricity is occurring in new homes in 
    all regions. Between 1995 and 2020, the world's annual consumption of electricity 
    is projected to rise from 12 trillion to 23 trillion kWh. The greatest increases 
    are expected in developing Asia and in Central and South America (EIA, 1998). 
    Climate warming in these regions would increase the demand for space cooling, 
    which is primarily fueled by electricity, at the same time that rapid electrification 
    already is stretching capacity. <br>
  <li>Air conditioning in the commercial sector already accounts for a greater 
    proportion of final energy demand than in the residential sector in developed 
    countries. Commercial sector energy use also is increasing as a percentage 
    of the total in developing countries. Some of this is a result of computerization 
    of commerce. 
</ul>
<p>Transportation activity and associated energy consumption are growing very 
  rapidly in nearly every region. Except for economies in transition, the amount 
  of goods traveling by road increased between 1990 and 1996. The increases were 
  50% or more, and total paved roadways worldwide rose from 39 to 46% of the total 
  (World Bank, 1999). In all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 
  (OECD) countries, car ownership continues to rise steadily, but much of the 
  growth in vehicle ownership is expected in developing countries and transition 
  economies-especially in east Asia and the Pacific, and especially in urban areas 
  (World Resources Institute, 1996). This trend contributes to local air pollution 
  (which can be exacerbated by warm weather episodes) and to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
  emissions. </p>
<p>A poleward intensification of agricultural, forestry, and mining activities 
  is occurring, resulting in increased population and intensified settlement patterns 
  in Canada's mid-north, for example, and even in arctic areas. Climate change 
  could profoundly affect settlements in these regions, if climate change is greater 
  toward the poles (Cohen, 1997). For example, some arctic and subarctic activities 
  such as mining depend on snow roads, which would have to be replaced with more 
  conventional transport. </p>
<p>Impact of urban wealth: Many of the worst city-level problems-such as sanitation 
  and water supply-have been addressed in high-income cities such as those in 
  Europe and North America, but not in many developing world cities (WHO, 1992; 
  Hardoy et al., 2000; McGranahan and Satterthwaite, 2000). A wealthy city can 
  more easily afford the public finance and administration required to regulate 
  more perceptible forms of pollution than a poor one. However, although the ambient 
  environment of high-income cities may be more benign in terms of health impacts 
  of pollution, these cities exert a far greater toll on the regional and global 
  environment (UNCHS, 1996). </p>
