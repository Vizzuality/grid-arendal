<h4>5.8.1.3. Food and Fiber Production </h4>
<p>Wild berries growing on peatlands are an important natural resource in many 
  regions of the boreal zone (Reier, 1982; Yudina et al., 1986; Salo, 1996). In 
  Finnish peatlands alone, the annual biological yield of wild berries may exceed 
  150 million kg, of which approximately 10% is picked, with a value of US$13.5 
  million (Salo, 1996). In North America, cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is 
  commercially cultivated in peatlands (Johnson, 1985). The use of peatlands for 
  agriculture has a long history; presently, 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> are under this 
  land use (Immirzi et al., 1992).</p>
<p>The importance of wetlands in North America as waterfowl habitat has long been 
  recognized (Mitch and Gosselink, 1993). The commercial value of these wetlands 
  is not direct; it comes through the added value of the activities of hunters 
  in local economies. Although there are few estimates of this service, much of 
  the wetland conservation effort in North America has focused on conservation, 
  enhancement, and creation of habitat.</p>
<p>Products from tropical forested wetlands include rattans, resins, latex, fungi, 
  fruit, honey, and medicinal plants, sale of which provides revenue for local 
  communities. Exploitation of fish from swamp forests and associated waterways 
  also can supply a modest income and is an important source of protein for local 
  human populations (Immirzi et al., 1996; Lee and Chai, 1996).</p>
<p>Forested wetlands are valuable for wood production, mostly as a result of wetland 
  modification. For example, in Finland, these wetlands produce about 18 million 
  m<sup>3</sup> of timber annually&#151;nearly 25% of the total annual increment 
  (Tomppo, 1998). Forested wetlands in the southern United States produce 39 million 
  m<sup>3</sup> of timber, of which 33 million m<sup>3</sup> are removed annually 
  (Shepard et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Direct harvest of forest resources from tropical peatlands yields several important 
  products, ranging from timber and bark to non-timber products (Immirzi et al., 
  1996; Lee and Chai, 1996). Southeast Asia's peat swamps yield some of the 
  most valuable tropical timbers&#151;in particular, ramin (Gonystylus bancanus) 
  (Ibrahim, 1996). </p>
<p>Peat has been used as a domestic energy source in northwestern and central 
  Europe for centuries (Feehan and O'Donovan, 1996). The present volume of 
  industrial peat harvesting is estimated at 71 million m<sup>3</sup>, most of 
  it in Finland and Ireland (Asplund, 1996). The peatland area occupied by peat 
  harvesting is rather small in comparison to the area of land uses such as agriculture 
  and forestry; for example, in Finland 24 million m<sup>3</sup> of energy peat 
  are harvested from an area of 530 km<sup>2</sup>. Employment aspects may be 
  important in peat harvesting because most peat sites are located in remote areas 
  where few industrial jobs are available. Peat harvesting may offer an estimated 
  550 permanent/seasonal jobs for each 1 million m<sup>3</sup> of produced peat 
  (Nyr&ouml;nen, 1996). Canada has a small but prosperous peat harvesting industry 
  for horticulture and medical uses (Rubec et al., 1988; Keys, 1992). Between 
  1986 and 1990, Canadian shipments were 662,000-812,000 t yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (Keys, 1992).</p>
