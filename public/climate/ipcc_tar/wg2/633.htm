<h3><a name="1728"></a>17.2.8. Food Security </h3>
<h4><a name="17281"></a>17.2.8.1. Crop Agriculture</h4>
<p>Subsistence agricultural production is vital to the economies, nutritional 
  status, and social well-being of small islands&#151;particularly the small, 
  low-lying, atoll states where food security is a major concern. The main subsistence 
  crops include taro, sweet potato, yam, breadfruit, bananas, coconut, and a variety 
  of vegetables. Production of cash crops such as sugarcane, copra, coffee, cocoa, 
  rubber, and tea (grown at higher elevations on high islands) also is important 
  because export of these products earns valuable foreign exchange. Climate change 
  could precipitate heat stress, changes in soil moisture and temperature, evapotranspiration, 
  and rainfall that might affect the growth of some subsistence root crops and 
  vegetables. The consequences of such changes for agriculture are likely to be 
  more severe in areas that already are under stress&#151;for example, water-scarce 
  islands. Crop agriculture also can be affected by tropical cyclones and other 
  extreme events, such as floods and droughts. To the extent that many small islands 
  are susceptible to these phenomena, it is highly likely that crop production 
  in these states would be impacted by alterations in the patterns of these events 
  as a consequence of climate change.</p>
<p>On low islands and atolls in the Pacific, practically all crop agriculture 
  is concentrated at or near the coast. Thus, changes in the height of the water 
  table and salinization as a result of sea-level rise would be stressful for 
  most varieties of taro and other crops, which have low tolerance for salt. It 
  has been suggested that in general, C<sub>3</sub> crops, which include many 
  tropical crops, will benefit more from the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization 
  than C<sub>4</sub> plants. However, recent findings indicate that the impact 
  on sugarcane and maize yields would be adverse (Jones <i>et al.,</i> 1999). 
</p>
<p>Singh and El Maayar (1998), using GCM (CCC 11) outputs and high, medium, and 
  low CO<sub>2</sub> emission scenarios coupled with a crop model (FAO) to simulate 
  crop yields, found that sugarcane yields may decrease by 20-40% under a 
  2xCO<sub>2</sub> climate change scenario in Trinidad and Tobago in the southern 
  Caribbean. The decrease in yields is attributed to increased moisture stress 
  caused by the warmer climate. These reductions in sugarcane yields deriving 
  from climate change are similar to those found for maize&#151;another C<sub>4</sub> 
  crop&#151;in nearby Venezuela (Maytin <i>et al.,</i> 1995). These results are 
  supported by similar findings in Mauritius, which are derived from the Agricultural 
  Production Systems Simulator Model (APSIM-Sugarcane) developed by the Agricultural 
  Production Systems Research Unit, Australia. The study projects a decline in 
  sucrose yield by more than 50% with a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> (Cheeroo-Nayamuth 
  and Nayamuth, 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="17282"></a>17.2.8.2. Fisheries</h4>
<p>Although fishing is largely artisanal or small-scale commercial, it is an important 
  activity on most small islands and makes a significant contribution to the protein 
  intake of island inhabitants (Blommestein <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mahon, 1996). 
  The impacts of climate change on fisheries are complex and in some cases are 
  indirect. As with other renewable resources, an assessment of climate change 
  impacts on fisheries is complicated by the presence of anthropogenic and other 
  non-climate-related stresses, such as habitat loss and overexploitation (Challenger, 
  1997). </p>
<p>Many breeding grounds for commercially important fish and shellfish are located 
  in shallow waters near coasts. These areas include mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass 
  beds, and salt ponds&#151;all of which are likely to be affected by climate 
  change. Generally, fisheries in the small island states are not expected to 
  be adversely affected by sea-level rise per se. Higher sea level would be a 
  critical factor for fisheries only if the rate of rise were far more rapid than 
  the current succession of coastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, seagrasses, corals) 
  on which some fish species depend (Everett, 1996). In tropical islands, these 
  ecosystems function as nurseries and forage sites for a variety of important 
  commercial and subsistence species. In this context, the unfavorable effects 
  of higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on coral reef development, coupled with 
  widespread coral bleaching, must be considered a significant threat in many 
  small island states (see <a href="628.htm#17241">Section 17.2.4.1</a>). Fish 
  production obviously would suffer if these habitats were endangered or lost 
  (Costa <i>et al., </i>1994).</p>
<p>On a global scale, it is not expected that climate change and climate variability 
  will lead to any significant reduction in fisheries production. However, important 
  changes in the abundance and distribution of local stocks (which may be of direct 
  concern to some small islands) are likely to occur (IPCC, 1996). For example, 
  Lehodey<i> et al.</i> (1997) have shown that spatial shifts in the abundance 
  of skipjack tuna in the Pacific are linked to the ENSO cycle. They note that 
  catches are highest in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool, which can be 
  displaced by as much as 50&deg; of longitude eastward during El Ni&ntilde;o 
  episodes and westward in La Ni&ntilde;a years (Lehodey <i>et al.,</i> 1997). 
  This must be a concern to Pacific islanders whose access to the skipjack stocks 
  now appears to be largely controlled by the periodicity of ENSO events. </p>
<p>Several management strategies for minimizing the adverse effects of climate 
  change on fish stocks have been proposed. These measures&#151;many of which 
  already are being implemented in some island states&#151;include conservation, 
  restoration, and enhancement of vital habitats such as mangroves, coral reefs, 
  and seagrass beds; establishment and management of marine reserves and protected 
  areas for identified critical species; and implementation of bilateral and multilateral 
  agreements and protocols for exploitation and management of shared fisheries 
  (migratory and straddling stocks) (IPCC, 1998; Berkes <i>et al.,</i> 2001). 
  Aquaculture also may be considered by island states as another means of reducing 
  stress on wild stocks. However, great precaution must be taken to ensure that 
  this measure does not exacerbate existing problems of habitat loss and competition 
  for nutrients (Carvalho and Clarke, 1998; see also <a href="302.htm#664">Section 
  6.6.4</a>).</p>
