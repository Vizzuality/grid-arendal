<h3>10.4.1. Feedbacks and Interactions </h3>
<p>Several integrated studies have looked at feedbacks and complex interactions 
  in African regional systems. In the west African Sahel, land surface-atmosphere 
  interactions have been examined in great detail to explore their role in interannual 
  variability of rainfall since the long drought that started in the late 1960s. 
  Reviews by Nicholson (2000) and Hunt (2000) summarize the state of knoweldge 
  for the physical climate of the Sahel. In general, surface processes modulate 
  rainfall variability, along with SST&#151;but in complex ways. The Sahel is 
  likely to remain a major study topic, and field-based observational studies 
  are on the rise. A field campaign in 1992 called the Hydrologic Atmosphere Pilot 
  Experiment (HAPEX)-Sahel was designed to find ways of improving modeling 
  of land surface properties; a series of HAPEX-Sahel papers were published in 
  a special issue of the <i>Journal of Hydrology</i> (Goutourbe <i>et al.,</i> 
  1997). More recently, a regional land-atmosphere experiment is underway in southern 
  Africa to study fires and emissions, with modeling studies planned to explore 
  land-atmosphere linkages (see &lt;<a target="_top" href="http://safari.gecp.virginia.edu">http://safari.gecp.virginia.edu</a>&gt;, 
  accessed October 2000). These studies&#151;and integrated modeling in general&#151;offer 
  comprehensive tools for studying the integrated Earth system. More studies of 
  this kind will assist in our understanding of linkages between land surface 
  processes, regional and global linkages, and human activities. </p>
<p>Biomass burning plays an important role in global atmospheric chemistry (Andreae, 
  1991), particularly with respect to generation of trace gases that lead to the 
  formation of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides, 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, volatile organic carbon (VOC, which also is a GHG), and smoke 
  particles (aerosols), which have an anti-greenhouse effect. Africa is a significant 
  location of biomass burning. In Africa, there are three main types of biomass 
  fires: those associated with land clearing for agriculture, which are mostly 
  located in humid tropical forests and the subhumid tropics; burning of wood 
  for domestic energy (either directly or after first converting it to charcoal); 
  and fires in natural and semi-natural vegetation, which are not associated with 
  changes in land cover or use. Emissions from all three types are of broadly 
  comparable magnitude (Scholes and Scholes, 1998), although the last category 
  has received the most attention.</p>
<p>Fires in natural vegetation are not considered to be a net source or sink in 
  the global carbon cycle because when integrated over large regions and over 
  several years, CO<sub>2</sub> (as well as CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, and VOC, which 
  ultimately converts to CO<sub>2</sub>) emitted by the fire is taken up again 
  by vegetation regrowth. This is true if the overall fire frequency or intensity 
  is not changing, but if fires become more frequent or consume more fuel over 
  time, the result will be a net CO<sub>2</sub> source; conversely, if fire frequency 
  is reduced or the fires burn less fuel, a carbon sink will result, manifested 
  as an increase in woody biomass. There is no evidence that at a contental scale, 
  fires in natural vegetation have increased or decreased in frequency or intensity 
  in the historic period. For some subregions (such as parts of southern and east 
  Africa), where there is clear thickening of the woody vegetation, it is likely 
  that fire regimes have become less frequent and intense during the 20th century.</p>
<p>During years of regional drought, such as those in southern Africa associated 
  with El Ni&ntilde;o events, the area burned decreases by about half (Justice 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1996). It is believed that this is caused principally by a decrease 
  in fuel availability.</p>
<p>The potential for teleconnections in impacts of land-use change on distant 
  climates further increases the risk in communities that may be at low risk but 
  will be impacted by actions taken in distant areas. For example, deforestation 
  of the central African basin leads to climatic impacts in the savannas to the 
  south in GCM modeling experiments (Semazzi and Song, 2001).</p>
<p>It is clear that rainfall (e.g., intensity) combined with land-use conversion 
  in watershed areas leads to increased soil erosion. Enhanced siltation in rivers 
  and increased use of chemicals also leaching into the runoff interferes with 
  river chemistry (e.g., eutrophication), with major implications for water quality 
  in lakes and coastal systems. Impacts on biodiversity&#151;hence important economic 
  fisheries, and consequent feedback on national economies&#151;is an area of 
  research that needs elucidation.</p>
<h3>10.4.2. Uncertainties and Risks<a name="1042"></a></h3>
<p>There is great uncertainty about how climate might change at subregional scales 
  in parts of Africa, especially how this might be influenced by human-driven 
  factors such as deforestation and alternative land uses. Regional climate modeling 
  will help reduce these uncertainties, and there are early results now of such 
  modeling for parts of Africa. For these results to be useful, they will have 
  to incorporate realistic disturbance regimes (e.g., realistic deforestation 
  mechanisms and land-use characterizations).</p>
<p>Climate change will manifest itself through changes in climate variability 
  and hence changes in extreme events. Given its socioeconomic status, Africa 
  is unlikely to respond any better to extreme events than it has in the past. 
  Flooding, droughts, and so forth are increasingly difficult for Africa to cope 
  with given increasing pressures on resources from rapid population growth and 
  dwindling resources. Most African countries remain largely unable to gather 
  adequate data and information in a timely manner to address critical problems 
  and surprises such as droughts and floods. Although progress is being made to 
  design environmental information systems, models for analyzing impacts and policy 
  options are largely nonexistent. Although adequate data probably exist, what 
  is needed is the capacity to access large amounts of data and synthesize it 
  into useful bits of information for decisionmaking. For example, satellite data 
  have been collected over the past 2 to 3 decades, yet their use is largely restricted 
  to mapping and short-term climate predictions. Effective information systems 
  and monitoring have not been achieved.</p>
<p>Evaluation of impacts in monetary or other quantitative terms remains a major 
  obstacle to comprehensive assessment of impacts of climate change for Africa. 
  Regional integrated assessment modeling, such as in Egypt (Yates and Strzepek, 
  1998), offers a solution, and model development should be accelerated for subregions 
  of Africa where building blocks exist (Desanker <i>et al.,</i> 2001).</p>
<p>ENSO-related impacts remain uncertain, given perceived changes in ENSO events 
  in terms of frequency and duration. However, much progress is being reported 
  in prediction of ENSO, and this information should be closely linked with case 
  studies of how different regions and populations respond to specific climate-related 
  events. These studies should document costs and benefits, as well as responses.</p>
