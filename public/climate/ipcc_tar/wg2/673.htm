<h2>19.4. Distribution of Impacts</h2>
<p>A second reason for concern is the distribution of impacts among people and 
  across regions. The impacts of climate change will not be distributed equally. 
  Some individuals, sectors, systems, and regions will be less affected&#151;or 
  may even benefit; other individuals, sectors, systems, and regions may suffer 
  significant losses. This pattern of relative benefits or losses is not likely 
  to remain constant over time. It will be different with different magnitudes 
  of climate change. Some regions may have gains only for certain changes in temperature 
  and precipitation and not for others. As a result, some regions that may first 
  see net benefits eventually may face losses as well as the climate continues 
  to warm. </p>
<h3><a name="1941"></a>19.4.1. Analysis of Distributional Incidence: State of 
  the Art</h3>
<p>Research into the distribution of impacts of climate change is in its infancy, 
  in large measure because this research poses several methodological challenges.</p>
<p>A first difficulty is synthesis&#151;the need to reduce the complex pattern 
  of individual impacts to a more tractable set of regional or sectoral indicators. 
  The challenge is to identify a set of indicators that can summarize and make 
  comparable the impacts in different regions, sectors, or systems in a meaningful 
  way. A range of indicators and methods have been put forward. Many models use 
  physical measures such as the number of people affected (e.g., Hoozemans et 
  al., 1993), change in net primary productivity (NPP) (White et al., 1999), or 
  the number of systems undergoing change (e.g., Alcamo et al., 1995). </p>
<p>The most widespread numeraire, however, is economic cost (Nordhaus, 1991, 1994a; 
  Cline, 1992; Hohmeyer and Gaertner, 1992; Titus, 1992; Downing et al., 1995, 
  1996; Fankhauser, 1995; Tol, 1995; Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999). This numeraire 
  is particularly well-suited to measure market impacts&#151;that is, impacts 
  that are linked to market transactions and directly affect GDP (i.e., a country's 
  national accounts). The costs of sea-level rise, for example, can be expressed 
  as the capital cost of protection plus the economic value of land and structures 
  at loss or at risk; agricultural impacts can be expressed as costs or benefits 
  to producers and consumers, including the incremental costs of adaptation. Using 
  a monetary numeraire to express nonmarket impacts such as effects on ecosystems 
  or human health is more difficult. It is possible in principle, however. There 
  is a broad and established literature on valuation theory and its application, 
  including studies (mostly in a nonclimate change context) on the monetary value 
  of lower mortality risk, ecosystems, quality of life, and so forth. However, 
  economic valuation can be controversial and requires sophisticated analysis, 
  which still is mostly lacking in a climate change context. </p>
<p>Physical metrics&#151;such as NPP or percentage of systems affected&#151;on 
  the other hand, are best suited for natural systems. When they are applied to 
  systems under human management, they suffer from being poorly linked to human 
  welfare, the ultimate indicator of concern. Some researchers therefore recommend 
  different numeraires for market impacts, mortality, ecosystems, quality of life, 
  and equity (Schneider et al., 2000b). They recognize, however, that final comparisons 
  across different numeraires nonetheless are required; they regard this as the 
  job of policymakers, however.</p>
<p>Persistent knowledge gaps is a second source of difficulty. Distributional 
  analysis depends heavily on the geographical details of climate change, but 
  these details are one of the major uncertainties in the outputs of climate change 
  models. This is particularly true for estimates of precipitation; for example, 
  estimates of water-sector impact can vary widely depending on the choice of 
  GCM.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn19.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  Uncertainties continue at the level of impact analysis. Despite a growing number 
  of country-level case studies, our knowledge of local impacts is still too uneven 
  and incomplete for a careful, detailed comparison across regions. Furthermore, 
  differences in assumptions often make it difficult to compare case studies across 
  countries. Only a few studies try to provide a coherent global picture on the 
  basis of a uniform set of assumptions. The basis of most such global impact 
  assessments tends to be studies undertaken in developed countries&#151;often 
  the United States&#151;which are then extrapolated to other regions. Such extrapolation 
  is difficult and will be successful only if regional circumstances are carefully 
  taken into account, including differences in geography, level of development, 
  value systems, and adaptive capacity. Not all analyses are equally careful in 
  undertaking this task.</p>
<p>There are other shortcomings that affect the quality of analysis. Although 
  our understanding of the vulnerability of developed countries is improving&#151;at 
  least with respect to market impacts&#151;information about developing countries 
  is quite limited. Nonmarket damages, indirect effects (e.g., the effect of changed 
  agricultural output on the food-processing industry), the link between market 
  and nonmarket effects (e.g., how the loss of ecosystem functions will affect 
  GDP), and the sociopolitical implications of change also are still poorly understood. 
  Uncertainty, transient effects (the impact of a changing rather than a changed 
  and static climate), and the influence of climate variability are other factors 
  that deserve more attention. Because of these knowledge gaps, distributional 
  analysis has to rely on (difficult) expert judgment and extrapolation if it 
  is to provide a comprehensive picture. </p>

      <p align="center"><b>Box 19-2. The Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Zones</b></p>
      <p>The impact of sea-level rise has been widely studied for many parts of 
        the world. Although uncertainties remain, several generic conclusions 
        can be drawn. First, impacts will not be distributed evenly. Islands and 
        deltas are particularly vulnerable. Second, forward-looking and sustainable 
        economic development, coupled with efficient adaptation (mostly protection 
        of vulnerable shores), can significantly reduce the economic impact of 
        sea-level rise. Some analysts have even found that coastal vulnerability 
        may decrease if the rate of economic development is sufficiently high 
        and climate change sufficiently slow. However, not all countries will 
        be able to undertake the necessary adaptation investments without outside 
        financial assistance, and uncertainty about sea levels (e.g., as a result 
        of storm surges) may make it difficult to identify efficient policies. 
        Third, coastal wetlands can cope with a relatively modest rate of sea-level 
        rise, but not with a fast one. Additional wetlands could be lost if their 
        migration is blocked by hard structures built to protect developed coastal 
        areas. Fourth, most of the impact will not be through gradual sea-level 
        rise but through extreme events such as floods and storms. This makes 
        people without insurance or a strong social network especially vulnerable. 
        Thus, as a whole, sea-level rise is likely to have strong negative effects 
        on some people, even if the aggregate impact is limited. Fifth, the aggregate 
        impact of sea-level rise could be roughly proportional to the observed 
        rise. At a local scale, however, sea-level rise is more likely to be felt 
        through successive crossings of thresholds.</p>

<p><a name="box192"></a>A third problem is adaptation. There has been substantial 
  progress in the treatment of adaptation since the SAR, but adaptation is difficult 
  to capture adequately in an impact assessment. Adaptation will entail complex 
  behavioral, technological, and institutional adjustments at all levels of society, 
  and the capacity to undertake them will vary considerably (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>). Various approaches are used to model adaptation (e.g., spatial analogs, 
  microeconomic modeling), but they are prone to systematic errors about its effectiveness. 
  The standard approach used in coastal impact assessment and in many agricultural 
  models is to include in the analysis a limited number of "prominent" but ultimately 
  arbitrary adaptations. This underestimates adaptive capacity because many potentially 
  effective adaptations are excluded (Tol et al., 1998). On the other hand, approaches 
  that are based on analogs&#151;such as the Ricardian approach used by, for example, 
  Mendelsohn et al. (1994), Mendelsohn and Dinar (1998), and Darwin (1999)&#151;probably 
  overestimate adaptive capacity because they neglect the cost of transition and 
  learning. This is especially true for cases in which adaptation in developed 
  countries today is used as a proxy for worldwide adaptation to an uncertain 
  future climate. Only a very few studies model adaptation as an optimization 
  process in which agents trade off the costs and benefits of different adaptation 
  options (Fankhauser, 1995; Yohe et al., 1995, 1996). </p>
<p>The analysis is further complicated by the strong link between adaptation and 
  other socioeconomic trends. The world will change substantially in the future, 
  and this will affect vulnerability to climate change. For example, a successful 
  effort to roll back malaria (as promoted by the development community) could 
  reduce the negative health effects of climate change. On the other hand, growing 
  pressure on natural resources from unsustainable economic development is likely 
  to exacerbate the impacts of climate change on natural systems. Even without 
  explicit adaptation, impact assessments therefore depend on the "type" 
  of socioeconomic development expected in the future. The sensitivity of estimates 
  to such baseline trends can be strong enough in some cases to reverse the sign 
  (i.e., a potentially negative impact can become positive under a suitable development 
  path, or vice versa) (Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999). </p>
<p>Despite the limits in knowledge, a few general patterns emerge with regard 
  to the distribution of climate change impacts. These patterns are derived from 
  general principles, observations of past vulnerabilities, and limited modeling 
  studies.</p>
