<h3>12.1.3. Socioeconomic Trends</h3>
<p>The region's population is growing at a rate of about 1.2% yr<sup>-1</sup>, 
  approximately equally from natural increase and immigration. The population 
  is progressively aging, in line with other OECD countries. Health status is 
  improving, but indigenous peoples lag significantly. The main population centers 
  are growing faster than rural areas. Australian lower latitude coastal zones 
  are developing two to three times faster than the Australian average (see <a href="480.htm#1264">Section 
  12.6.4</a>), for urban/suburban uses and for recreation and tourism. In New 
  Zealand, there is a steady internal migration northward to Auckland.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodity prices have tended to fall, but yields per hectare have 
  risen, and farm sizes and total volume of production have increased (ABARE, 
  1997; Wilson and Johnson, 1997). Average return on agricultural assets is low. 
  Service industries are an increasing fraction of all industry, and there is 
  a trend toward more intensive agriculture and forestry and to diversification 
  of rural land use, including specialty crops and tourism. There is increasing 
  competition for water in areas of low rainfall where irrigation is essential 
  to intensive cropping; urban demands are rising quickly, and water is needed 
  to maintain natural ecosystems (Hassall and Associates, <i>et al.</i>, 1998). 
  Tourism is a major growth industry that is increasing the pressure on areas 
  of attractions such as coastal zones and reefs. </p>
<p>Environmental concerns include air and water pollution from urban industries, 
  land transport, and intensive farming and related processing and soil erosion, 
  rising water tables, and salinization. Environmental management increasingly 
  is based on the principle of sustainable management, as enshrined in New Zealand's 
  Resource Management Act, and an integrated approach to environmental impacts 
  in both countries. A major trend to a "user pays" principle and, especially 
  in Australia, to market-driven water rights, with caps on irrigation supplies, 
  is causing significant changes in rural industry. However, there still are many 
  instances, particularly in coastal management, where these principles are not 
  applied.</p>

<h3>12.1.4. Climate Trends</h3>
<p>Trends identified in the region continue to be generally consistent with those 
  elsewhere in the world. Research on regional trends has been summarized in Salinger 
  <i>et al.</i> (1996) and in specific studies by Plummer (1996), Torok and Nicholls 
  (1996), Holbrook and Bindoff (1997, 2000), Lavery <i>et al.</i> (1997), Plummer 
  <i>et al.</i> (1997), Zheng <i>et al.</i> (1997), McKeon <i>et al.</i> (1998), Collins and Della-Marta 
  (1999), Hennessy <i>et al.</i> (1999), and Plummer <i>et al.</i> (1999).</p>
<p>Mean temperatures have risen by 0.05-0.1&ordm;C per decade over the past 
  century, with a commensurate increase in the frequency of very warm days and 
  a decrease in the frequency of frosts and very cold days (Plummer <i>et al.</i>, 1999; 
  Collins <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Nighttime temperatures have risen faster than daytime 
  temperatures; hence, the diurnal temperature range has decreased noticeably 
  in most places. The past decade has seen the highest recorded mean annual temperatures. 
</p>
<p>Trends in rainfall are less clear. Australian annual mean rainfall has increased 
  by a marginally significant amount over the past century (Collins and Della-Marta, 
  1999; Hennessy <i>et al.</i>, 1999). However, increases in the frequency of heavy rainfalls 
  and average rainfall are significant in many parts of Australia. Average rainfall 
  has increased most in the northwest and southeast quadrants (Collins and Della-Marta, 
  1999). The largest and most statistically significant change has been a decline 
  in rainfall in the winter-rainfall-dominated region of the far southwest of 
  western Australia, where in the period 1910-1995, winter (June-July-August, 
  JJA) rainfall declined by 25%, mainly during the 1960s and 1970s. Previous studies 
  (Wright, 1974; Allan and Haylock, 1993; Yu and Neil, 1993), as well as a more 
  recent one (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 2000), have noted this decrease and attribute it to 
  atmospheric circulation changes, predominantly resulting from natural variability.</p>
<p>There are marked interdecadal variations over northern and eastern Australia 
  in summer half-year rainfall, which are dominated by ENSO-induced variations 
  (Power <i>et al.</i>, 1999a). There also are clear interannual and decadal variations 
  in central and eastern Australian rainfall associated with Indian and Pacific 
  Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (Power <i>et al.</i>, 1999b). Some of the regional 
  linear trends observed during the past century merely may reflect a particular 
  pattern of decadal variation. Thus, the high degree of decadal variability may 
  enhance or obscure a signal that is related to climatic change for several decades. 
  A growing body of evidence is being obtained about past climate variability 
  from coral cores (e.g., Lough and Barnes, 1997; Isdale <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Quinn <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>The strength of the relationship between eastern Australian climate and ENSO 
  has been observed to vary over the past century. This seems to be linked to 
  longer term climate oscillations such as the North Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
  (NPDO) (e.g., Power <i>et al.</i>, 1999a). Salinger and Mullan (1999) examined the 
  20-year periods before and after 1977 and showed increases after 1977 (some 
  statistically significant) in mean rainfall for New Zealand's west coast, 
  associated with strengthening westerly winds. These fluctuations in rainfall 
  are partially explained by the increase in El Ni&ntilde;o conditions over recent 
  decades. There is some evidence of long-term variations in the Australasian 
  region in storm frequency and tropical cyclones (Nicholls <i>et al.</i>, 1996a; Radford 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Hopkins and Holland, 1997; Leighton <i>et al.</i>, 1997). 
  Nicholls <i>et al.</i> (1998) show that although there has been a decrease in tropical cyclone 
  numbers from 1969 to 1996 in the Australian region (105&deg;E to 160&deg;E), 
  there has been an increase in the frequency of intense tropical cyclones with 
  central pressures of less than 970 hPa.</p>
<p>The average rise in sea level in the Australia/New Zealand region over the 
  past 50 years is about 20 mm per decade (Rintoul <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Salinger <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996), which is within the range of the current estimate of global sea-level 
  rise (IPCC, 1996, WGI Section 7.2.1). However, the greater frequency and duration 
  of El Ni&ntilde;o episodes since the mid-1970s has reduced local New Zealand 
  sea-level trends: The average sea-level change since 1975 at Auckland is close 
  to zero (Bell <i>et al.</i>, 1999). There has been a weak warming trend in ocean temperatures 
  to 100-m depth in the southwest Pacific (39&deg;S to 49&deg;S, 141&deg;E to 
  179&deg;E) of about 0.13&deg;C during the 34-year period 1955-1988 (Holbrook 
  and Bindoff, 1997), and there have been shorter period SST fluctuations associated 
  with ENSO.</p>
