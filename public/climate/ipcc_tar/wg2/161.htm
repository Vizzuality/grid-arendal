<h1><a name="41"></a>4.1. Introduction and Scope</h1>
This chapter assesses our understanding of the implications of climate change 
for the hydrological cycle, water resources, and their management. Since the beginnings 
of concern over the possible consequences of global warming, it has been widely 
recognized that changes in the cycling of water between land, sea, and air could 
have very significant impacts across many sectors of the economy, society, and 
the environment. The characteristics of many terrestrial ecosystems, for example, 
are heavily influenced by water availability and, in the case of instream ecosystems 
and wetlands, by the quantity and quality of water in rivers and aquifers. Water 
is fundamental to human life and many activities&#151;most obviously agriculture 
but also industry, power generation, transportation, and waste management&#151;and 
the availability of clean water often is a constraint on economic development. 
Consequently, there have been a great many studies into the potential effects 
of climate change on hydrology (focusing on cycling of water) and water resources 
(focusing on human and environmental use of water). The majority of these studies 
have concentrated on possible changes in the water balance; they have looked, 
for example, at changes in streamflow through the year. A smaller number of studies 
have looked at the impacts of these changes for water resources&#151;such as the 
reliability of a water supply reservoir or the risk of flooding&#151;and even 
fewer explicitly have considered possible adaptation strategies. This chapter 
summarizes key findings of research that has been conducted and published, but 
it concentrates on assessing opportunities and constraints on adaptation to climate 
change within the water sector. This assessment is based not only on the few studies 
that have looked explicitly at climate change but also on considerable experience 
within different parts of the water sector in adapting to changing circumstances 
in general. 
<p>This chapter first summarizes the state of knowledge of climate change impacts 
  on hydrology and water resources (<a href="162.htm">Section 4.2</a>), before 
  assessing effects on the hydrological cycle and water balance on the land (<a href="164.htm">Section 
  4.3</a>). <a href="176.htm">Section 4.4</a> examines potential changes in water 
  use resulting from climate change, and <a href="179.htm">Section 4.5</a> assesses 
  published work on the impacts of climate change for some water resource management 
  systems. <a href="186.htm">Section 4.6</a> explores the potential for adaptation 
  within the water sector. The final two sections (<a href="191.htm">Sections 
  4.7</a> and <a href="193.htm">4.8</a>) consider several integrative issues as 
  well as science and information requirements. The implications of climate change 
  on freshwater ecosystems are reviewed in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>, although 
  it is important to emphasize here that water management is increasingly concerned 
  with reconciling human and environmental demands on the water resource. The 
  hydrological system also affects climate, of course. This is covered in the 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">Working Group I contribution to the Third Assessment Report 
  (TAR)</a>; the present chapter concentrates on the impact of climate on hydrology 
  and water resources.</p>
<p>At the outset, it is important to emphasize that climate change is just one 
  of many pressures facing the hydrological system and water resources. Changing 
  land-use and land-management practices (such as the use of agrochemicals) are 
  altering the hydrological system, often leading to deterioration in the resource 
  baseline. Changing demands generally are increasing pressures on available resources, 
  although per capita demand is falling in some countries. The objectives and 
  procedures of water management are changing too: In many countries, there is 
  an increasing move toward &#147;sustainable&#148; water management and increasing 
  concern for the needs of the water environment. For example, the Dublin Statement, 
  agreed at the International Conference on Water and the Environment in 1992, 
  urges sustainable use of water resources, aimed at ensuring that neither the 
  quantity nor the quality of available resources are degraded. Key water resources 
  stresses now and over the next few decades (Falkenmark, 1999) relate to access 
  to safe drinking water, water for growing food, overexploitation of water resources 
  and consequent environmental degradation, and deterioriation in water quality. 
  The magnitude and significance of these stresses varies between countries. The 
  late 1990s saw the development of several global initiatives to tackle water-related 
  problems: The UN Commission on Sustainable Development published the &#147;Comprehensive 
  Assessment of the Freshwater Resources of the World&#148; (WMO, 1997), and the 
  World Water Council asked the World Commission for Water to produce a vision 
  for a &#147;water-secure world&#148; (Cosgrove and Rijbersman, 2000). A series 
  of periodical reports on global water issues was initiated (Gleick, 1998). The 
  impacts of climate change, and adaptation to climate change, must be considered 
  in the context of these other pressures and changes in the water sector.</p>
