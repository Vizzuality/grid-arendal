<h2>9.4. Thermal Stress (Heat Waves, Cold Spells) </h2>
<h3><a name="941"></a>9.4.1. Heat Waves </h3>
<p>Global climate change is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the frequency 
  and intensity of heat waves, as well as warmer summers and milder winters (see 
  <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a>). The impact of extreme summer heat 
  on human health may be exacerbated by increases in humidity (Gaffen and Ross, 
  1998; Gawith <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Daily numbers of deaths increase during very hot weather in temperate regions 
  (Kunst <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1993; Ando, 1998a,b). For example, in 1995, a heat 
  wave in Chicago caused 514 heat-related deaths (12 per 100,000 population) (Whitman 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997), and a heat wave in London caused a 15% increase 
  in all-cause mortality (Rooney <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998). Excess mortality 
  during heat waves is greatest in the elderly and people with preexisting illness 
  (Sartor <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1995; Semenza <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996; Kilbourne, 
  1997; Ando <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998a,b). Much of this excess mortality from 
  heat waves is related to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease. 
  The mortality impact of a heat wave is uncertain in terms of the amount of life 
  lost; a proportion of deaths occur in susceptible persons who were likely to 
  have died in the near future. Nevertheless, there is a high level of certainty 
  that an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves would increase 
  the numbers of additional deaths from hot weather. Heat waves also are associated 
  with nonfatal impacts such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion (Faunt <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>., 1995; Semenza <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Heat waves have a much bigger health impact in cities than in surrounding suburban 
  and rural areas (Kilbourne, 1997; Rooney <i>et al</i>., 1998). Urban areas typically 
  experience higher&#151;and nocturnally sustained&#151;temperatures because of 
  the "heat island" effect (Oke, 1987; Quattrochi <i>et al</i>., 2000). Air pollution 
  also is typically higher in urban areas, and elevated pollution levels often 
  accompany heat waves (Piver <i>et al</i>., 1999) (see also <a href="356.htm#9612">Section 
  9.6.1.2</a> and <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). </p>
<p>The threshold temperature for increases in heat-related mortality depends on 
  the local climate and is higher in warmer locations. A study based on data from 
  several European regions suggests that regions with hotter summers do not have 
  significantly different annual heat-related mortality compared to cold regions 
  (Keatinge <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, in the United States, cities with colder 
  climates are more sensitive to hot weather (Chestnut <i>et al</i>., 1998). Populations 
  will acclimatize to warmer climates via a range of behavioral, physiological, 
  and technological adaptations. Acclimatization will reduce the impacts of future 
  increases in heat waves, but it is not known to what extent. Initial physiological 
  acclimatization to hot environments can occur over a few days, but complete 
  acclimatization may take several years (Zeisberger <i>et al</i>., 1994). </p>
<p>Weather-health studies have used a variety of derived indices&#151;for example, 
  the air mass-based synoptic approach (Kalkstein and Tan, 1995) and perceived 
  temperature (Jendritzky <i>et al</i>., 2000). Kalkstein and Greene (1997) estimated 
  future excess mortality under climate change in U.S. cities. Excess summer mortality 
  attributable to climate change, assuming acclimatization, was estimated to be 
  500-1,000 for New York and 100-250 for Detroit by 2050, for example. 
  Because this is an isolated study, based on a particular method of treating 
  meteorological conditions, the chapter team assigned a medium level of certainty 
  to this result.</p>
<p>The impact of climate change on mortality from thermal stress in developing 
  country cities may be significant. Populations in developing countries (e.g., 
  in Mexico City, New Delhi, Jakarta) may be especially vulnerable because they 
  lack the resources to adapt to heat waves. However, most of the published research 
  refers to urban populations in developed countries; there has been relatively 
  little research in other populations. </p>
<h3><a name="942"></a>9.4.2. Decreased Mortality Resulting from Milder Winters</h3>
<p>In many temperate countries, there is clear seasonal variation in mortality 
  (Sakamoto-Momiyama, 1977; Khaw, 1995; Laake and Sverre, 1996); death rates during 
  the winter season are 10-25% higher than those in the summer. Several studies 
  indicate that decreases in winter mortality may be greater than increases in 
  summer mortality under climate change (Langford and Bentham, 1995; Martens, 
  1997; Guest <i>et al</i>., 1999). One study estimates a decrease in annual cold-related 
  deaths of 20,000 in the UK by the 2050s (a reduction of 25%) (Donaldson <i>et 
  al</i>., 2001). However, one study estimates that increases in heat-related 
  deaths will be greater than decreases in cold-related death in the United States 
  by a factor of three (Kalkstein and Greene, 1997).</p>
<p>Annual outbreaks of winter diseases such as influenza, which have a large effect 
  on winter mortality rates, are not strongly associated with monthly winter temperatures 
  (Langford and Bentham, 1995). Social and behavioral adaptations to cold play 
  an important role in preventing winter deaths in high-latitude countries (Donaldson 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Sensitivity to cold weather (i.e., the percentage increase 
  in mortality per 1&ordm;C change) is greater in warmer regions (e.g., Athens, 
  southern United States) than in colder regions (e.g., south Finland, northern 
  United States) (Eurowinter Group, 1997). One possible reason for this difference 
  may be failure to wear suitable winter clothing. In North America, an increase 
  in mortality is associated with snowfall and blizzards (Glass and Zack, 1979; 
  Spitalnic <i>et al</i>., 1996; Gorjanc <i>et al</i>., 1999) and severe ice storms 
  (Munich Re, 1999). <br>
</p>
<p>The extent of winter-associated mortality that is directly attributable to 
  stressful weather therefore is difficult to determine and currently is being 
  debated in the literature. Limited evidence indicates that, in at least some 
  temperate countries, reduced winter deaths would outnumber increased summer 
  deaths. The net impact on mortality rates will vary between populations. The 
  implications of climate change for nonfatal outcomes is not clear because there 
  is very little literature relating cold weather to health outcomes.</p>
