<h2>13.2. Key Regional Concerns</h2>
<h3> <a name="1321"></a>13.2.1. Water and Land Resources </h3>
<h4><a name="13211"></a>13.2.1.1. Water Resources </h4>
<p>Europe has a very diverse hydrological background, reflecting its varied climate 
  and topography. In the south there is very significant variation in flow through 
  the year, with long, dry summers. To the west there is less extreme variation, 
  and in catchments underlain by absorbent aquifers flows remain reasonably constant 
  through the year. In the north and east, much precipitation falls as snow, so 
  much flow occurs during the spring snowmelt period. Major rivers such as the 
  Rhine, Rhone, Po, and Danube distribute water from the "water tower" of the 
  Alps. Superimposed on this varied hydrological base is a wide variety of water 
  uses, pressures, and management approaches. A succession of floods and droughts 
  has illustrated Europe's vulnerability to hydrological extremes. There are many 
  other water-related pressures on Europe's environment, however (see the Dobris 
  Assessment-Stanners and Bourdeau, 1995), such as increasing demand for water, 
  particularly in the south, and subsequent increases in abstractions. River ecosystems 
  and wetlands are increasingly at risk. The quality of Europe's rivers, lakes, 
  and groundwater is being threatened by the discharge of sewage and industrial 
  waste (often a legacy from past industrial development) and by excessive application 
  of pesticides and fertilizers. At the same time, the institutional aspects of 
  water resources management are changing. There is a shift in many countries 
  from "supply-side" solutions to a "demand-side" approach, aimed at reducing 
  demand for water or exposure to risk. Water managers in many European countries 
  have adopted (at least in principle) a sustainable approach, and forthcoming 
  EU directives are likely to encourage this further. Environmental demands are 
  being taken increasingly seriously across most of Europe. Climate change adds 
  another set of potential pressures on European water resources and their management. 
</p>
<h4><a name="132111"></a>13.2.1.1.1. Changes in hydrological cycle </h4>
<p>Climate and land-use change influence the structure of the water balance (Ryszkowski 
  and Kedziora, 1987; Ryszkowski et al., 1990; Olejnik and Kedziora, 1991). Calculations 
  at the European scale (Arnell, 1999) indicate that under most climate change 
  scenarios, northern Europe would see an increase in annual average streamflow, 
  but southern Europe would experience a reduction in streamflow. In much of mid-latitude 
  Europe, annual runoff would decrease or increase by about 10% by the 2050s, 
  but the change resulting from climate may be smaller than "natural" multidecadal 
  variability in runoff. To the south and north, it may be substantially larger 
  (Hulme et al., 1999). <a href="#tab131">Table 13-1</a> lists catchment-scale 
  studies into potential hydrological changes in Europe that have been conducted 
  since the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). </p>

<p>The consequences of climate change for the variation of flow through the year 
  vary across Europe. In Mediterranean regions, climate change is likely to exaggerate 
  considerably the range in flows between winter and summer. In maritime western 
  Europe, the range also is likely to increase, but to a lesser extent. In more 
  continental and upland areas, where snowfall makes up a large proportion of 
  winter precipitation, a rise in temperature would mean that more precipitation 
  falls as rain and therefore that winter runoff increases and spring snowmelt 
  decreases. The timing of streamflow therefore alters significantly. Further 
  east and at higher altitudes, most of the precipitation continues to fall as 
  snow, so the distribution of flow through the year is altered little (Arnell, 
  1999). The substantial projected change in flow regime resulting from reduction 
  in snowfall and snowmelt across large parts of CEE has been noted widely (e.g., 
  Hladny et al., 1996; Kasparék, 1998; Hlavcova and Cunderlik, 1998; Starosolszky 
  and Gauzer, 1998). </p>
<p>Low-flow frequency generally will increase across most of Europe (Arnell, 1999), 
  although in some areas where the minimum occurs during winter the absolute magnitude 
  of low flows may increase because winter runoff increases: The season of lowest 
  flow shifts toward summer. An implication of simulated changes in streamflow 
  is that riverine flood risk generally would increase across much of Europe and 
  that in some areas, the time of greatest risk would move from spring to winter. 
  Effects on groundwater recharge (a major resource for many Europeans) are less 
  clear because the general increase in winter rainfall may be offset by a reduction 
  in the recharge season. Studies in the UK (Arnell and Reynard, 1999) and Estonia 
  (Jarvet, 1998) indicate that groundwater recharge could be increased by climate 
  change. </p>
<p>Implications of climate change for river water quality have been less well 
  studied, but an increase in water temperature and widespread reductions in flow 
  during summer are likely to lead to deterioration in many determinants of water 
  quality (particularly dissolved oxygen concentrations). Jansons and Butina (1998) 
  estimate nitrate and phosphate loads in a catchment in Latvia from streamflow; 
  they use the relationships to infer an increase in nitrate and phosphate loads 
  in winter (when flow increased) and a decrease in spring. Their model, however, 
  did not account for possible temperature-related effects on nitrate and phosphate 
  concentrations. Higher water temperatures are likely to increase the risk of 
  blue-green algal blooms in rivers and lakes (e.g., Zalewski and Wagner, 1995). 
</p>
<h4><a name="132112"></a>13.2.1.1.2. Water management </h4>
<p>The impacts of climate change on European water resources and their management 
  depend not only on the change in hydrology but also (perhaps more particularly) 
  on characteristics of the water management system. In general terms, the more 
  stressed the system is under current conditions, the more sensitive it will 
  be to climate change. <a href="498.htm#tab132">Table 13-2</a> summarizes the 
  key potential impacts on European water resources. These impacts should be considered 
  against the background of other pressures and drivers on European water. Most 
  of the potential impacts are self-explanatory. </p>
<p>Changes in the water resource base affect many sectors within Europe, including 
  agriculture, industry, transport, power generation, the built environment, and 
  ecosystems. Similarly, changes in many of these sectors will affect hydrology 
  and the resource base. Changes in agricultural practices resulting from climate 
  change, for example, will affect volumes and, more likely, quality of streamflow. 
</p>
<p>In many European countries, industrial water use has declined as a result of 
  legislation, environmental protection, and economic change. The warmer climate 
  may lead to significant increase in water demands in southern Europe-leading 
  to possible overexploitation of groundwater resources, decrease of baseflow, 
  and environmental degradation. Climate change is but one of the pressures facing 
  European water managers. They will be played out against varying socioeconomic 
  backgrounds, political demands for environmental improvements, and new trends 
  in integrated water management. More detail on this and the foregoing conclusions 
  appear in the water chapter of the European ACACIA report (Arnell, 2000). </p>
