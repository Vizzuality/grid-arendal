<h3>2.5.2. Market Impacts </h3>
<p>Cost and valuation exercises work best when competitive markets exist. Even 
  when markets are distorted, they provide some useful information. This section 
  offers brief insights into how the elements described can be applied in these 
  situations.</p>
<h4><a name="2521"></a>2.5.2.1. Deadweight Loss</h4>
<p>Deadweight loss is a measure of the value of aggregate economic welfare that 
  is lost when marginal social opportunity cost does not equal marginal social 
  benefit. Aggregate economic welfare can be regarded as the sum of the total 
  benefit derived from consuming a specific quantity of a specific good, net of 
  the total opportunity cost of its production. Aggregate welfare is maximized 
  in a competitive market. Deadweight loss therefore can be computed as the difference 
  between economic welfare generated in a distorted market and economic welfare 
  attained at the social optimum of a competitive market. More specifically, it 
  is estimated as the area under a demand curve that reflects marginal social 
  benefits and above a supply curve that reflects marginal social cost between 
  the observed or anticipated outcome and the social optimum&#151;the outcome 
  that would equate marginal social costs and benefits. Moreover, changes in deadweight 
  loss can be deduced by computing the appropriate areas even if the social optimum 
  cannot be identified. In either case, deadweight loss simply is the sum of a 
  change in private benefits, differences between social and private benefits, 
  a change in private costs, and differences between social and private costs.</p>
<h4><a name="2522"></a>2.5.2.2. Preexisting Distortions</h4>
<p>Market-based exercises that evaluate the costs and benefits of change must 
  carefully account for preexisting distortions in markets. In the presence of 
  one distortion, in fact, creation of another might actually improve welfare. 
  Changes may or may not work to reduce preexisting distortions, so they actually 
  can produce benefits that would be missed entirely if analyses were confined 
  to competitive conditions. Goulder and Schneider (1999), for example, have noted 
  that preexisting subsidies to conventional energy industries reduce the costs 
  of climate policies but that preexisting subsidies to alternative energy industries 
  would increase costs. Moreover, they point out that the opportunity costs of 
  research and development (R&amp;D) could be reduced or even reversed if there 
  were an ample supply of R&amp;D providers rather than a scarcity.</p>
