<h4>11.2.1.6. Protected Areas and Risks to Living Species </h4>
<p>Protected areas usually are designated and managed to keep wild species that 
  live within the area from becoming extinct. Even after an area has been set 
  aside as protected habitat, extinction or population declines may still occur 
  as a result of changes in environmental conditions related to climate change, 
  land use in surrounding areas, or widespread pollution. Climate change is likely 
  to induce vegetation change that will force wild plant and animal species to 
  shift their distribution in response to the new conditions. For example, a variety 
  of changes in butterflies, dragonflies, beetles, and other migratory insects 
  have been recorded in green corridors of Japan in recent years (Ubukata, 2000), 
  and shifts have been recorded in the ranges of many North American, European, 
  Arctic, and Antarctic bird and insect species (see <a href="218.htm">Section 
  5.4</a>). If the protected area is not large enough to contain an area that 
  will be suitable under the new climate conditions, a species may become locally 
  extinct. In contrast, protected areas that are large enough to cover an elevation 
  or a latitudinal gradient should allow species to make adjustments along the 
  gradient as conditions change. In some cases, such as in coastal areas, habitat 
  may simply be lost as a result of factors such as sea-level rise, with no potential 
  area for species to migrate. </p>
<p>Frontier forests in Asia are home to more than 50% of the world's terrestrial 
  plant and animal species (Rice, 1998). Risks to this rich array of living species 
  are increasing. For instance, of the 436 species of mammals and 1,500 species 
  of birds in Indonesia, more than 100 species each of mammals and birds have 
  been declared threatened (UNEP, 1999). Similar trends also are seen in China, 
  India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand. In India, as many as 1,256 higher plant 
  species, of more than 15,000 species, are threatened (Sukumar et al., 1995). 
</p>
<p>Coastal areas are likely to be at risk from climate change-induced sea-level 
  rise. A rise in the water level of estuaries will reduce the size and connectedness 
  of small islands and coastal and estuarine reserves and increase their isolation. 
  The Yangtze (Changjiang) and Mekong deltas on mainland China and the Mai Po 
  marshes in Hong Kong are refueling stops for migratory birds, especially ducks, 
  geese, and shorebirds. The presence of these birds may be threatened by the 
  disappearance of coastal marshes as a result of increases in sea level from 
  global warming (Li et al., 1991; Tang, 1995). Similarly, the Rann of Kutch in 
  India supports one of the largest Greater Flamingo colonies in Asia (Ali, 1985; 
  Bapat, 1992). With sea-level rise, these salt marshes and mudflats are likely 
  to be submerged (Bandyopadhyay, 1993), which would result in decreased habitat 
  for breeding flamingoes and lesser floricans (Sankaran et al., 1992). In addition, 
  about 2,000 Indian wild asses in the Rann of Kutch could lose their only habitat 
  in India to rising sea level (Clark and Duncan, 1992).</p>
<p>The Sundarbans of Bangladesh, which support a diversity of wildlife, are at 
  great risk from rising sea level. These coastal mangrove forests provide habitat 
  for species such as Bengal tigers, Indian otters, spotted deer, wild boars, 
  estuarine crocodiles, fiddler crabs, mud crabs, three marine lizard species, 
  and five marine turtle species (Green, 1990). With a 1-m rise in sea level, 
  the Sundarbans are likely to disappear, which may spell the demise of the tiger 
  and other wildlife (Smith et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Species that live in mountainous areas also are particularly at risk of losing 
  habitat as a result of changes in climate. Extreme temperature conditions may 
  cause these protected areas to undergo major changes, partly because of high 
  rates of variation in habitat structure that naturally occur on mountain ranges 
  as a result of changes in slope, steepness, and exposure. Protected areas also 
  may be subjected to extreme surface runoffs because of rapid melting of winter 
  snow. Because many Asian mountain ranges are east-west oriented, there will 
  be little room for species to shift their ranges toward cooler mountainous habitat. 
  An additional barrier to wildlife movements in mountainous habitat derives from 
  the fact that many of the larger reserves in central Asia are located along 
  international borders. Depending on topography, if these borders are heavily 
  fenced, most of the larger terrestrial vertebrates will not be able to respond 
  spatially to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>Besides loss of habitat, wild species are at risk from changes in environmental 
  conditions that favor forest fires and drought. For example, forest fires under 
  unseasonably high temperatures in Nepal may threaten local extinction for red 
  pandas, leopards, monkeys, deer, bears, and other wild animals. If the frequency 
  of these extreme events increases, the frequency of fire also may increase. 
  Similarly, increases in the frequency of dry spells and local droughts may decrease 
  populations. For example, drought-related decreases in the density and persistence 
  of Green Leaf Warblers have been recorded on their wintering grounds in the 
  Western Ghats of south India (Katti and Price, 1996). In desert ecosystems, 
  protected areas often are located around oases, which are the basis for the 
  existence of much of the local fauna. Protected oases often are far apart, so 
  droughts that cause a decline in local forage often cause mass mortality because 
  animals may not be able to move on to adjacent oases. The frequency of these 
  droughts therefore is a key component in the viability of populations in such 
  protected areas (Safriel, 1993).</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to act synergistically with many other stressors, 
  such as land conversion and pollution, leading to major impacts on protected 
  areas and species (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Currently designated 
  major protected areas in Asia need to be examined with respect to the ability 
  of their species to shift in range in response to changing climate, as well 
  as with respect to how much habitat could be lost. Many species&#151;especially 
  those in coastal areas and mountainous habitats&#151;could experience large 
  population declines; some may become extinct at least in part because of climate 
  changes.</p>
