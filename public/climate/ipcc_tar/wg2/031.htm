<h2>4. Natural and Human Systems</h2>
<p>Natural and human systems are expected to be exposed to climatic variations 
  such as changes in the average, range, and variability of temperature and precipitation, 
  as well as the frequency and severity of weather events. Systems also would 
  be exposed to indirect effects from climate change such as sea-level rise, soil 
  moisture changes, changes in land and water condition, changes in the frequency 
  of fire and pest infestation, and changes in the distribution of infectious 
  disease vectors and hosts. The sensitivity of a system to these exposures depends 
  on system characteristics and includes the potential for adverse and beneficial 
  effects. The potential for a system to sustain adverse impacts is moderated 
  by adaptive capacity. The capacity to adapt human management of systems is determined 
  by access to resources, information and technology, the skill and knowledge 
  to use them, and the stability and effectiveness of cultural, economic, social, 
  and governance institutions that facilitate or constrain how human systems respond.

<p><i><a name="figts3"></a>There are apparent trends in streamflow volumes&#151;increases 
  and decreases&#151;in many regions.</i> However, confidence that these trends 
  are a result of climate change is low because of factors such as the variability 
  of hydrological behavior over time, the brevity of instrumental records, and 
  the response of river flows to stimuli other than climate change. <i>In contrast, 
  there is high confidence that observations of widespread accelerated glacier 
  retreat and shifts in the timing of streamflow from spring toward winter in 
  many areas are associated with observed increases in temperature.</i> High confidence 
  in these findings exists because these changes are driven by rising temperature 
  and are unaffected by factors that influence streamflow volumes. Glacier retreat 
  will continue, and many small glaciers may disappear (high confidence). The 
  rate of retreat will depend on the rate of temperature rise. [<a href="167.htm#4361">4.3.6.1</a>, 
  <a href="174.htm">4.3.11</a>]</p>
<p><i>The effect of climate change on streamflow and groundwater recharge varies 
  regionally and among scenarios, largely following projected changes in precipitation.</i> 
  In some parts of the world, the direction of change is consistent between scenarios, 
  although the magnitude is not. In other parts of the world, the direction of 
  change is uncertain. Possible streamflow changes under two climate change scenarios 
  are shown in <a href="#figts3">Figure TS-3</a>. Confidence in the projected 
  direction and magnitude of change in streamflow and groundwater recharge is 
  largely dependent on confidence in the projected changes in precipitation. The 
  mapped increase in streamflow in high latitudes and southeast Asia and the decrease 
  in streamflow in central Asia, the area around the Mediterranean, and southern 
  Africa are broadly consistent across climate models. Changes in other areas 
  vary between climate models. [<a href="166.htm#435">4.3.5</a>, <a href="168.htm">4.3.6.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Peak streamflow will move from spring to winter in many areas where snowfall 
  currently is an important component of the water balance (high confidence).</i> 
  Higher temperatures mean that a greater proportion of winter precipitation falls 
  as rain rather than snow and therefore is not stored on the land surface until 
  it melts in spring. In particularly cold areas, an increase in temperature would 
  still mean that winter precipitation falls as snow, so there would be little 
  change in streamflow timing in these regions. The greatest changes therefore 
  are likely to be in "marginal" zones&#151;including central and eastern Europe 
  and the southern Rocky Mountain chain&#151;where a small temperature rise reduces 
  snowfall substantially. [<a href="168.htm">4.3.6.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Water quality generally would be degraded by higher water temperatures (high 
  confidence). The effect of temperature on water quality would be modified by 
  changes in flow volume, which may either exacerbate or lessen the effect of 
  temperature, depending on the direction of change in flow volume.</i> Other 
  things being equal, increasing water temperature alters the rate of operation 
  of biogeochemical processes (some degrading, some cleaning) and, most important, 
  lowers the dissolved oxygen concentration of water. In rivers this effect may 
  be offset to an extent by increased streamflow&#151;which would dilute chemical 
  concentrations further&#151;or enhanced by lower streamflow, which would increase 
  concentrations. In lakes, changes in mixing may offset or exaggerate the effects 
  of increased temperature. [<a href="173.htm">4.3.10</a>]</p>
<p><i>Flood magnitude and frequency are likely to increase in most regions, and 
  low flows are likely to decrease in many regions.</i> The general direction 
  of change in extreme flows and flow variability is broadly consistent among 
  climate change scenarios, although confidence in the potential magnitude of 
  change in any catchment is low. The general increase in flood magnitude and 
  frequency is a consequence of a projected general increase in the frequency 
  of heavy precipitation events, although the effect of a given change in precipitation 
  depends on catchment characteristics. Changes in low flows are a function of 
  changes in precipitation and evaporation. Evaporation generally is projected 
  to increase, which may lead to lower low flows even where precipitation increases 
  or shows little change. [<a href="171.htm">4.3.8</a>, <a href="172.htm">4.3.9</a>]</p>
<p>Approximately 1.7 billion people, one-third of the world's population, 
  presently live in countries that are water-stressed (i.e., using more than 20% 
  of their renewable water supply&#151;a commonly used indicator of water stress). 
  This number is projected to increase to about 5 billion by 2025, depending on 
  the rate of population growth. Projected climate change could further decrease 
  streamflow and groundwater recharge in many of these water-stressed countries&#151;for 
  example, in central Asia, southern Africa, and countries around the Mediterranean 
  Sea&#151;but may increase it in some others.</p>
<p><i>Demand for water generally is increasing, as a result of population growth 
  and economic development, but is falling in some countries.</i> Climate change 
  may decrease water availability in some water-stressed regions and increase 
  it in others. Climate change is unlikely to have a large effect on municipal 
  and industrial demands but may substantially affect irrigation withdrawals. 
  In the municipal and industrial sectors, it is likely that nonclimatic drivers 
  will continue to have very substantial effects on demand for water. Irrigation 
  withdrawals, however, are more climatically determined, but whether they increase 
  or decrease in a given area depends on the change in precipitation: Higher temperatures, 
  hence crop evaporative demand, would mean that the general tendency would be 
  toward an increase in irrigation demands. [<a href="177.htm">4.4.2</a>, <a href="178.htm">4.4.3</a>, 
  <a href="180.htm">4.5.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>The impact of climate change on water resources depends not only on changes 
  in the volume, timing, and quality of streamflow and recharge but also on system 
  characteristics, changing pressures on the system, how management of the system 
  evolves, and what adaptations to climate change are implemented. Nonclimatic 
  changes may have a greater impact on water resources than climate change.</i> 
  Water resources systems are evolving continually to meet changing management 
  challenges. Many of the increased pressures will increase vulnerability to climate 
  change, but many management changes will reduce vulnerability. Unmanaged systems 
  are likely to be most vulnerable to climate change. By definition, these systems 
  have no management structures in place to buffer the effects of hydrological 
  variability. [<a href="180.htm">4.5.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Climate change challenges existing water resources management practices 
  by adding uncertainty. Integrated water resources management will enhance the 
  potential for adaptation to change.</i> The historic basis for designing and 
  operating infrastructure no longer holds with climate change because it cannot 
  be assumed that the future hydrological regime will be the same as that of the 
  past. The key challenge, therefore, is incorporating uncertainty into water 
  resources planning and management. Integrated water resources management is 
  an increasingly used means of reconciling different and changing water uses 
  and demands, and it appears to offer greater flexibility than conventional water 
  resources management. Improved ability to forecast streamflow weeks or months 
  ahead also would significantly enhance water management and its ability to cope 
  with a changing hydrological variability. [<a href="186.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Adaptive capacity (specifically, the ability to implement integrated water 
  resources management), however, is very unevenly distributed across the world.</i> 
  In practice, it may be very difficult to change water management practices in 
  a country where, for example, management institutions and market-like processes 
  are not well developed. The challenge, therefore, is to develop ways to introduce 
  integrated water management practices into specific institutional settings&#151;which 
  is necessary even in the absence of climate change to improve the effectiveness 
  of water management. [<a href="189.htm">4.6.4</a>]</p>
