<h2><a name="62"></a>6.2. State of Knowledge </h2>
<p>In the past decade there has been considerable improvement in our knowledge 
  of the impacts of climate change on coastal zones and marine ecosystems. This 
  improvement has been far from uniform, either thematically or in regional coverage, 
  and there are still substantial gaps in our understanding.</p>
<p>The First and Second Assessment Reports on ocean systems (Tsyban <i>et al.</i>, 1990; 
  Ittekkot <i>et al.</i>, 1996) conclude that global warming will affect the oceans through 
  changes in sea-surface temperature (SST), sea level, ice cover, ocean circulation, 
  and wave climate. A review of the global ocean thermohaline circulation system&#151;for 
  which the term "ocean conveyor belt" has been coined (Broecker, 1994, 
  1997)&#151;emphasizes the role of the global ocean as a climate regulator. Ittekkot 
  <i>et al.</i> (1996) notes that the oceans also function as a major heat sink and form 
  the largest reservoir of the two most important greenhouse gases [water vapor 
  and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)], as well as sustaining global biogeochemical cycles. 
</p>
<p>Climate-change impacts on the ocean system that were projected with confidence 
  by Ittekkot <i>et al.</i> (1996) include SST-induced shifts in the geographic distribution 
  of marine biota and changes in biodiversity, particularly in high latitudes; 
  future improvement of navigation conditions in presently ice-infested waters; 
  and sea-level changes resulting from thermal expansion and changes in terrestrial 
  ice volume. Regional variations caused by dynamic processes in the atmosphere 
  and ocean also were identified with some confidence. Less confident predictions 
  include changes in the efficiency of carbon uptake through circulation and mixing 
  effects on nutrient availability and primary productivity; changes in ocean 
  uptake and storage capacity for greenhouse gases; and potential instability 
  in the climate system caused by freshwater influx to the oceans and resultant 
  weakening of the thermohaline circulation. </p>
<p>The SAR includes a comprehensive review of climate-change impacts on fisheries 
  (Everett <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Principal impacts are believed to be compounded by overcapacity 
  of fishing fleets, overfishing, and deterioration of aquatic habitats. The authors 
  also note that the impacts of natural climate variability on the dynamics of 
  fish stocks is being considered as an important component of stock management, 
  although the nature and magnitude of that variability are not clear. </p>
<p>In the present report, we identify new information about the impacts of climate 
  change that has accumulated since the SAR. We include assessments of impacts 
  on fisheries, marine mammals, sea birds, aquaculture, and marine diseases. We 
  show that more recent information identifies natural multi-year climate-ocean 
  trends as an essential consideration in fisheries management and stewardship 
  of marine ecosystems. We point out that separating the impacts of natural climate 
  variability and regime shifts from those associated with long-term climate change 
  will be important, although distinguishing between the two will be a difficult 
  task.</p>
<p>The potential impacts of sea-level rise on coastal systems have been emphasized 
  in recent years. Much less attention has been given to the effects of increases 
  in air and sea-surface temperatures; and changes in wave climate, storminess, 
  and tidal regimes. There are at least two reasons for this lack of attention. 
  First, low-lying coastal areas such as deltas, coastal plains, and atoll islands 
  are regarded as particularly vulnerable to small shifts in sea level. Second, 
  global sea-level rise is regarded as one of the more certain outcomes of global 
  warming and already is taking place. Over the past 100 years, global sea level 
  has risen by an average of 1-2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, and scientists anticipate that 
  this rate will accelerate during the next few decades and into the 22nd century. 
</p>
<p>The FAR (Tsyban <i>et al.</i>, 1990) regards sea-level rise as the most important 
  aspect of climate change at the coast and identifies seven key impacts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lowland inundation and wetland displacement
  <li>Shoreline erosion<br>
  <li>More severe storm-surge flooding<br>
  <li>Saltwater intrusion into estuaries and freshwater aquifers<br>
  <li>Altered tidal range in rivers and bays<br>
  <li>Changes in sedimentation patterns<br>
  <li>Decreased light penetration to benthic organisms.
</ol>
<p>In the SAR, Bijlsma <i>et al.</i> (1996) acknowledge the importance of these impacts 
  and further conclude, with high confidence, that natural coastal systems will 
  respond dynamically to sea-level rise; responses will vary according to local 
  conditions and climate; and salt marshes and mangroves may survive where vertical 
  accretion equals sea-level rise&#151;but built infrastructure limits the potential 
  for landward migration of coastal habitats. That report also provides summaries 
  of national and global vulnerability assessments, focusing on numbers of people, 
  land areas, and assets at risk. Several coastal adaptation strategies are identified. 
  The importance of resilience in coastal systems is hinted at and subsequently 
  has become an important consideration in vulnerability analysis of sectors and 
  geographical regions.</p>
