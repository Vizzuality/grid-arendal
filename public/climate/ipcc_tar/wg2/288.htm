<a name="632"></a><h3>6.3.2. Biological Processes </h3>
<p>Marine biota have an important role in shaping climate. Marine biological processes 
  sequester CO<sub>2</sub> and remove carbon from surface waters to the ocean interior through 
  the settling of organic particles and as ocean currents transport dissolved 
  organic matter. This process, which is called the biological pump, reduces the 
  total carbon content of the surface layers and increases it at depth. This process 
  may be partially offset by biocalcification in reefs and organisms in the open 
  ocean, which increases surface layer CO<sub>2</sub> by reducing bicarbonate alkalinity. 
</p>
<p>Projected global warming through the 21st century is likely to have an appreciable 
  effect on biological processes and biodiversity in the ocean. A rise in temperature 
  will result in acceleration of biodegradation and dispersal of global organic 
  pollutants (petroleum and chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example). This process 
  would promote their removal from the photic zone of the ocean, as has been demonstrated 
  by Tsyban (1999a) for the Bering and Chukchi Seas.</p>
<p>Physiochemical and biological processes regulate uptake and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  by oceans. The Arctic Ocean, for instance, is an important CO<sub>2</sub> source in winter 
  and sink in summer (Tsyban, 1999b). Climate change is expected to affect the 
  processes that control the biogeochemical cycling of elements. Uptake and storage 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean via the biological pump therefore may change. Any changes 
  that do occur are expected to feed back into the carbon cycle (Ittekkot <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Photosynthesis, the major process by which marine biota sequester CO<sub>2</sub>, is thought 
  to be controlled by the availability of nutrients and trace elements such as 
  iron (de Baar <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Behrenfeld <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Coale <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Falkowsky 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Changes in freshwater runoff resulting from climate warming could 
  affect the inputs of nutrients and iron to the ocean, thereby affecting CO<sub>2</sub> 
  sequestration. Impacts are likely to be greatest in semi-enclosed seas and bays.</p>
<p>Climate change can cause shifts in the structure of biological communities 
  in the upper ocean&#151;for example, between coccoliths and diatoms. In the 
  Ross Sea, diatoms (primarily Nitzshia subcurvata) dominate in highly stratified 
  waters, whereas Phaeocystis antarctica dominate when waters are more deeply 
  mixed (Arrigo <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Such shifts alter the downward fluxes of organic 
  carbon and consequently the efficiency of the biological pump.</p>
<a name="633"></a><h3>6.3.3. Marine Carbon Dioxide Uptake</h3>
<p>The oceans are estimated to have taken up approximately 30% (with great uncertainties) 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions arising from fossil-fuel use and tropical deforestation between 
  1980 and 1989, thereby slowing down the rate of greenhouse global warming (Ittekkot 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996). An important process in the oceans is burial of organic carbon 
  in marine sediments, which removes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> for prolonged time periods. 
  Studies of the Southern Ocean by Caldeira and Duffy (2000) have shown high fluxes 
  of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> but very low storage. Model results imply that if global 
  climate change reduces the density of surface waters in the Southern Ocean, 
  isopycnal surfaces that now outcrop may become isolated from the atmosphere, 
  which would tend to diminish Southern Ocean carbon uptake.</p>
<p>Using models of the effects of global warming on ocean circulation patterns, 
  Sarmiento and Le Qu&eacute;r&eacute; (1996) analyzed the potential for changes 
  in oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. They found that a weakening of the thermohaline circulation 
  could reduce the ocean's ability to absorb CO<sub>2</sub> whereby, under a doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  scenario, oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> dropped by 30% (exclusive of biological effects) 
  over a 350-year period. In simulations with biological effects under the same 
  CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and time frame, they found that the oceanic uptake was reduced 
  only by 14%. Confirmation that a collapse of global thermohaline circulation 
  could greatly reduce the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean has been reported by Joos 
  <i>et al.</i> (1999).</p>
<p>Sarmiento <i>et al.</i> (1998) modeled carbon sequestration in the ocean with increasing 
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels and changing climate from 1765 to 2065. They found substantial 
  changes in the marine carbon cycle, especially in the Southern Ocean, as a result 
  of freshwater inputs and increased stratification, which in turn reduces the 
  downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere.</p>
