<p><a name="figspm1"></a>Available observational evidence indicates that regional 
  changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have already affected 
  a diverse set of physical and biological systems in many parts of the world. 
  Examples of observed changes include shrinkage of glaciers, thawing of permafrost, 
  later freezing and earlier break-up of ice on rivers and lakes, lengthening 
  of mid- to high-latitude growing seasons, poleward and altitudinal shifts of 
  plant and animal ranges, declines of some plant and animal populations, and 
  earlier flowering of trees, emergence of insects, and egg-laying in birds (see 
  <a href="#figspm1">Figure SPM-1</a>). Associations between changes in regional 
  temperatures and observed changes in physical and biological systems have been 
  documented in many aquatic, terrestrial, and marine environments. [<a href="024.htm#21">2.1</a>, 
  <a href="033.htm">4.3</a>, <a href="034.htm">4.4</a>, <a href="047.htm">5.7</a>, 
  and <a href="050.htm#71">7.1</a>]</p>
<p>The studies mentioned above and illustrated in <a href="#figspm1">Figure SPM-1</a> 
  were drawn from a literature survey, which identified long-term studies, typically 
  20 years or more, of changes in biological and physical systems that could be 
  correlated with regional changes in temperature. <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  In most cases where changes in biological and physical systems were detected, 
  the direction of change was that expected on the basis of known mechanisms. 
  The probability that the observed changes in the expected direction (with no 
  reference to magnitude) could occur by chance alone is negligible. In many parts 
  of the world, precipitation-related impacts may be important. At present, there 
  is a lack of systematic concurrent climatic and biophysical data of sufficient 
  length (2 or more decades) that are considered necessary for assessment of precipitation 
  impacts.</p>
<p>Factors such as land-use change and pollution also act on these physical and 
  biological systems, making it difficult to attribute changes to particular causes 
  in some specific cases. However, taken together, the observed changes in these 
  systems are consistent in direction and coherent across diverse localities and/or 
  regions (see <a href="#figspm1">Figure SPM-1</a>) with the expected effects 
  of regional changes in temperature. Thus, from the collective evidence, there 
  is high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
  that recent regional changes in temperature have had discernible impacts on 
  many physical and biological systems.</p>
<h2><a name="22"></a>2.2. There are Preliminary Indications that Some Human Systems 
  have been Affected by Recent Increases in Floods and Droughts</h2>
<p>There is emerging evidence that some social and economic systems have been 
  affected by the recent increasing frequency of floods and droughts in some areas. 
  However, such systems are also affected by changes in socioeconomic factors 
  such as demographic shifts and land-use changes. The relative impact of climatic 
  and socioeconomic factors are generally difficult to quantify. [<a href="036.htm">4.6</a>
