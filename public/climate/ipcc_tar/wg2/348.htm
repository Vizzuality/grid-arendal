<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Global climate change will have a wide range of health impacts. Overall, negative 
  health impacts are anticipated to outweigh positive health impacts. Some health 
  impacts would result from changes in the frequencies and intensities of extremes 
  of heat and cold and of floods and droughts. Other health impacts would result 
  from the impacts of climate change on ecological and social systems and would 
  include changes in infectious disease occurrence, local food production and 
  nutritional adequacy, and concentrations of local air pollutants and aeroallergens, 
  as well as various health consequences of population displacement and economic 
  disruption.</p>
<p>There is little published evidence that changes in population health status 
  actually have occurred as yet in response to observed trends in climate over 
  recent decades. A recurring difficulty in identifying such impacts is that the 
  causation of most human health disorders is multifactorial and the "background" 
  socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental context varies constantly. A further 
  difficulty is foreseeing all of the likely types of future health effects, especially 
  because for many of the anticipated future health impacts it may be inappropriate 
  to extrapolate existing risk-function estimates to climatic-environmental conditions 
  not previously encountered. Estimation of future health impacts also must take 
  account of differences in vulnerability between populations and within populations 
  over time.</p>
<p>Research since the Second Assessment Report (SAR) mainly has described the 
  effect of climate variability, particularly daily and seasonal extremes, on 
  health outcomes. Studies of health impacts associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) have identified interannual climate-health relationships 
  for some epidemic diseases. The upward trend in worldwide numbers of people 
  adversely affected by weather disasters has been characterized by peak impacts 
  during El Ni&ntilde;o events. Meanwhile, there has been an expanded effort to 
  develop, test, and apply mathematical models for predicting various health outcomes 
  in relation to climate scenarios. This mix of epidemiological studies and predictive 
  modeling leads to the following conclusions.</p>
<p>An increase in the frequency or intensity of heat waves will increase the risk 
  of mortality and morbidity, principally in older age groups and the urban poor 
  (high confidence). The greatest increases in thermal stress are forecast for 
  higher latitude (temperate) cities, especially in populations that have limited 
  resources, such as access to air conditioning. The pattern of acclimatization 
  to future climate regimes is difficult to estimate. Recent modeling of heat 
  wave impacts in U.S. urban populations, allowing for acclimatization, suggests 
  that several U.S. cities would experience, on average, several hundred extra 
  deaths per summer. Poor urban populations in developing countries may be particularly 
  vulnerable to the impacts of increased heat waves, but no equivalent predictions 
  are available. Warmer winters and fewer cold spells, because of climate change, 
  will decrease cold-related mortality in many temperate countries (high confidence). 
  The reduction in winter deaths will vary between populations. Limited evidence 
  indicates that, in at least some temperate countries, reduced winter deaths 
  would outnumber increased summer deaths.</p>
<p>Any regional increases in climate extremes (storms, floods, cyclones, etc.) 
  associated with climate change would cause physical damage, population displacement, 
  and adverse effects on food production, freshwater availability and quality, 
  and would increase the risks of infectious disease epidemics, particularly in 
  developing countries (very high confidence/ well-established). Over recent years, 
  several major climate-related disasters have had major adverse effects on human 
  health&#151;including floods in China, Mozambique, Bangladesh, and Europe; famine 
  in Sudan; and Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Central America. Although these 
  events cannot be confidently attributed to climate change, they indicate the 
  susceptibility of vulnerable populations to the adverse effects of such events. 
</p>
<p>Climate change will cause some deterioration in air quality in many large urban 
  areas, assuming that current emission levels continue (medium to high confidence). 
  Increases in exposure to ozone and other air pollutants (e.g., radon, forest 
  fire particulates) could increase known morbidity and mortality effects. </p>
<p>Vector-borne diseases are maintained in complex transmission cycles involving 
  blood-feeding arthropod vectors (and usually reservoir hosts) that depend on 
  specific ecological conditions for survival. These diseases are sensitive to 
  climatic conditions, although response patterns vary between diseases. In areas 
  with limited or deteriorating public health infrastructure, and where temperatures 
  now or in the future are permissive of disease transmission, an increase in 
  temperatures (along with adequate rainfall) will cause certain vector-borne 
  diseases (including malaria, dengue, and leishmaniasis) to extend to higher 
  altitudes (medium to high confidence) and higher latitudes (medium to low confidence). 
  Higher temperatures, in combination with conducive patterns of rainfall and 
  surface water, will prolong transmission seasons in some endemic locations (medium 
  to high confidence). In other locations, climate change will decrease transmission 
  via reductions in rainfall or temperatures that are too high for transmission 
  (low to medium confidence). In all such situations, the actual health impacts 
  of changes in potential infectious disease transmission will be strongly determined 
  by the effectiveness of the public health system.</p>
