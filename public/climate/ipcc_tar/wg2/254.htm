<h4>5.6.3.1.5. Climate-induced changes in variability and weather extremes </h4>
<p>The net rate of carbon storage in forests varies as a result of interannual 
  variability in rainfall, temperature, and disturbance regimes. For example, 
  transient simulations with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) suggest that 
  forests of the Amazon basin during hot, dry El Ni&ntilde;o years were a net 
  source of carbon (of as much as 0.2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>), whereas in other 
  years they were a net sink (as much as 0.7 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Tian et al., 
  1998). Notably, source and sink strength varied across the basin, indicating 
  regional variation. Similarly for the United States, the net rate of carbon 
  storage varied from a net source of about 0.1 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> to a net 
  sink of 0.2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Schimel et al., 2000). The rate of carbon 
  accumulation in undisturbed forests of the Amazon basin reported by Tian et 
  al. (1998) was approximately equal to the annual source from deforestation in 
  the same area. For the United States, Houghton et al. (1999)&#151;using inventory 
  data&#151;estimate a sink of 0.35 Gt yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1980s as a result 
  of forest management and regrowth on abandoned agricultural lands, whereas Schimel 
  et al. (2000) indicate that 0.08 Gt yr<sup>-1</sup> stored from 1980 to 1993 
  could have been a result of carbon fertilization and climate effects. Thus, 
  for the United States, the rate of carbon accumulation in forest regrowth on 
  abandoned agricultural and harvested managed forest lands appears to be as large 
  as or larger than the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and climate (Schimel 
  et al., 2000). The SAR (Kirschbaum et al., 1996) suggests that modeled trends 
  described above are unlikely to continue under projected climate change and 
  high elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. However, climatic variability (including 
  ENSO events) is likely to increase under a changed climate (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>), which may increase interannual variation in regional carbon uptake&#151;as 
  demonstrated by Tian et al. (1998) and Schimel et al. (2000). </p>
<h4><a name="5632"></a>5.6.3.2. Responses and Impacts: Timber and Non-Wood Goods 
  and Services</h4>
<h4><a name="56321"></a>5.6.3.2.1. Response to locally extreme events</h4>
<p>In addition to fire and insect predation, other episodic losses may become 
  increasingly important in response to locally extreme weather events. For example, 
  in Europe, wind-throw damage has appeared to increase steadily from negligible 
  values prior to about 1950; wind-throws exceeding 20 million m<sup>3</sup> have 
  occurred 10 times since then (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000b). Losses in 1990 and 1999 were 
  estimated at 120 million and 193 million m<sup>3</sup>, respectively&#151;the 
  latter equivalent to 2 years of harvest and the result of just three storms 
  over a period of 3 days (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000b). The unusual 1998 icestorms in eastern 
  North America caused heavy damage to infrastructure as well as large areas of 
  forest, the extent of which is still being assessed (Irland, 1998). </p>
<p>Financial returns to forest landowners decline if these episodic events (including 
  fire and insect predation) increase (Haight et al., 1995), although the impact 
  on global timber supply of such episodic losses is unlikely to be significant. 
  Local effects on timber and non-wood goods and services may be significant, 
  although timber loss may be ameliorated through salvage logging. Moreover, the 
  location of the loss is particularly important for non-wood products and services. 
  For example, forest fires in recreational areas are known to have an impact 
  (Englin et al., 1996).</p>
