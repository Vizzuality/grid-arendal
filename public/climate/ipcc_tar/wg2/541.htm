<h4>14.2.5.4. Effects of El Ni&ntilde;o Phenomenon on Health </h4>
<p>There is good evidence that the ENSO cycle is associated with increased risk 
  of certain diseases (PAHO, 1998b). ENSO events may affect the distribution (reproduction 
  and mortality) of disease vectors (Epstein <i>et al., </i>1998). El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events raise SST over the tropical Pacific, affecting some pathogenic agents. 
  McMichael and Kovats (1998b), Patz (1998), and Instituto Nacional de Salud (1998a,b) 
  have speculated that the last cholera outbreak in Peru, beginning in 1991, was 
  linked with an El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon (1990-1995). The outbreak spread 
  to most of the South American subcontinent, including places as far away as 
  Buenos Aires (OPS, 1999). de Gar&iacute;n<i> et al. </i>(2000) have reported 
  that El Ni&ntilde;o has important impacts in andean population; they found large 
  amounts of the insect, as well as eggs for the next period, in the northern 
  part of Argentina.</p>
<p>Higher temperatures over coastal Peru associated with ENSO may have an impact 
  on gastrointestinal infections. Salmonella infections increased after a flood 
  in Bolivia, which resulted from the El Ni&ntilde;o event of 1983 (Valencia Teller&iacute;a, 
  1986). Salazar-Lindo<i> et al.</i> (1997) report that the number of patients 
  with diarrhea and dehydration admitted to a rehydration unit in Lima, Peru, 
  was 25% higher than usual during 1997, when temperatures where higher than normal 
  as a result of the emerging El Ni&ntilde;o. Increases in the incidence of acute 
  diarrheas and acute respiratory diseases were recorded in Bolivia (Valencia 
  Teller&iacute;a, 1986) and Peru (Gueri <i>et al.,</i> 1986).</p>
<p>The effects of natural events vary by region, and the same weather condition 
  may have the opposite effect in different areas for the same disease (e.g., 
  a dry year may induce malaria epidemics in humid regions but cause malaria decreases 
  in arid regions) (McMichael and Kovats, 1998b). For example, ENSO has been associated 
  with severe drought in Iquitos, Peru, and the state of Roraima, Brazil, where 
  malaria cases have drastically decreased (OPS, 1998; Confalonieri and Costa-D&iacute;az, 
  2000). In Venezuela, malaria mortality has been shown to be more strongly related 
  to the occurrence of drought in the year preceding outbreaks than to rainfall 
  during epidemic years (Bouma and Dye, 1997). The El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon appears 
  to be responsible in particular for serious epidemics in Peru, including one 
  of malaria in 1983 (Moreira, 1986; Russac, 1986; Valencia Teller&iacute;a, 1986), 
  as well as cutaneous diseases, leptospirosis, and respiratory infections in 
  1998 (Instituto Nacional de Salud, 1998b). Compared with other years, malaria 
  cases in Colombia increased 17.3% during an El Ni&ntilde;o year and 35.1% in 
  the post-El Ni&ntilde;o year. Upsurges of malaria in Colombia during El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events are associated with its hydrometeorological variables&#151;in particular, 
  the increase in air temperature that enhances reproductive and biting rates 
  and decreases the extrinsic incubation period, as well as changes in precipitation 
  rates that favor formation of ponds and stagnant pools and thus create more 
  mosquito breeding sites (Poveda and Rojas, 1997; Poveda<i> et al.,</i> 1999a,b).</p>
<p>Global analyses have shown no association between ENSO and the number of flood 
  disasters (Dilley and Heyman, 1995) or between ENSO and the numbers of persons 
  affected by floods and landslides (Bouma <i>et al.,</i> 1997). However, the 
  number of persons affected by landslides, particularly in South America, increases 
  in the year after the onset of El Ni&ntilde;o (Bouma <i>et al.,</i> 1997). In 
  1983, the impacts of El Ni&ntilde;o in Peru increased total mortality by nearly 
  40% and infant mortality by 103% (Toledo-Tito, 1997).</p>
<p>Predicting malaria risk associated with ENSO and related climate variables 
  may serve as a short-term analog for predicting longer term effects posed by 
  global climate change. The ability to predict years of high and low risk for 
  malaria can be used to improve preventive measures (Bouma<i> et al.,</i> 1997).
