<h4>14.2.5.2. Vector-Borne Diseases</h4>
<p>Arthropod vector organisms for vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are sensitive to 
  climatic and hydrometeorological conditions (especially temperature and humidity, 
  stagnant water pools, and ponds), as are life-cycle stages of the infecting 
  parasite within the vector (Bradley, 1993; Haines <i>et al.,</i> 1993; Curto 
  de Casas <i>et al.,</i> 1994; Ando <i>et al., </i>1998). Hence, the geographic 
  range of potential transmission of VBDs may change under conditions of climate 
  change (Leaf, 1989; Shope, 1991; Carcavallo and Curto de Casas, 1996; McMichael<i> 
  et al.,</i> 1996; Patz <i>et al., </i>1996; WHO, 1998). Several studies have 
  concluded that temperature affects the major components of vectorial capacity 
  (Carcavallo<i> et al.</i>, 1998; Carcavallo, 1999; Moreno and Carcavallo, 1999). 
</p>
<p>Mosquitoes, in particular, are highly sensitive to climatic factors (Curto 
  de Casas and Carcavallo, 1995). <i>Anopheline spp.</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i> 
  mosquitoes have established temperature thresholds for survival, and there are 
  temperature-dependent incubation periods for the parasites and viruses within 
  them (the extrinsic incubation period) (Curto de Casas and Carcavallo, 1995; 
  de Gar&iacute;n and Bejar&aacute;n, 1998a,b; Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 1998; de 
  Gar&iacute;n <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Climate change may influence the population 
  dynamics of vectors for Chagas' disease (Burgos<i> et al., </i>1994), as 
  well as the number of blood-feedings of mosquitoes and, therefore, the possibilities 
  of infective direct contacts (Catal&aacute;, 1991; Catal&aacute;<i> et al.,</i> 
  1992).</p>
<p>Of relevance to infectious disease distribution, minimum temperatures are now 
  increasing at a disproportionate rate compared to average and maximum temperature 
  (Karl<i> et al., </i>1995). Such conditions may allow dengue and other climate-sensitive 
  VBDs to extend into regions that previously have been free of disease or exacerbate 
  transmission in endemic parts of the world. Temperature is one of the factors 
  that can influence the seasonal transmission of malaria. Near the equator in 
  Iquitos, Peru, seasonality in transmission is driven by small temperature fluctuation 
  (1-2&deg;C) (Patz <i>et al.,</i> 1998). The current and projected expansion 
  of the range of vector species into the subtropics and to higher elevations 
  warrant heightened entomological and epidemiological surveillance and control 
  in highland areas and for populations living on the fringes of regions that 
  now are affected (Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 1998). </p>
<p>Reemergence of dengue fever in Colombia followed reinvasion of the country 
  by the principal mosquito vector (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>), and the disease hit 
  with large upsurges following periods of heavy rain (Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 
  1995). The mosquito vector for dengue and yellow fever has been reported at 
  an elevation of 2,200 m in Colombia (Su&aacute;rez and Nelson, 1981).</p>
<p>Climate variability, environmental change, and lack of control of vector reproduction 
  already have affected the distribution of VBDs. In Honduras, a sustained increase 
  in ambient temperature makes the southern part too hot for anopheline mosquitoes, 
  and reported cases of malaria have dropped off. Large areas of northeast tropical 
  rainforest have been cleared, and migrants concentrated there tend not to be 
  immune to malaria (Almendares <i>et al.,</i> 1993).</p>
<h4>14.2.5.3. Water-Borne Diseases<a name="14253"></a></h4>
<p>Extremes of the hydrological cycle, such as water shortages and flooding, could 
  worsen the diarrhea disease problem. In developing countries, water shortages 
  cause diarrhea through poor hygiene. On the other extreme, flooding can contaminate 
  drinking water from watershed runoff or sewage overflow (Patz, 1998). Depending 
  on the disease agent and its transmission maintenance cycle, the effect may 
  be an increase or a decrease in the incidence of infectious diseases (Gubler, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Between the first case of the current cholera outbreak&#151;reported in Peru 
  in 1991&#151;and December 1996, cholera spread to more than 21 countries, resulting 
  in almost 200,000 cases and more than 11,700 reported deaths (OPS, 1998). Colwell 
  and Huq (1994) have collected data in Bangladesh and Peru suggesting that cholera 
  has a complex route of transmission that is influenced by climate&#151;in particular, 
  SST and sea-level variations (Lobitz<i> et al.,</i> 2000). It has been suggested 
  that the spread of <i>Vibrio cholerae </i>may be related to the development 
  of various algae and zooplankton. Extensive studies during the past 25 years 
  confirming the hypothesis that <i>V. cholerae</i> is autochthonous to the aquatic 
  environment and is a commensal of zooplankton (i.e., copepods), combined with 
  the findings of satellite data analyses, provide strong evidence that cholera 
  epidemics are climate-linked (Lobitz <i>et al.,</i> 2000). Increased coastal 
  algae blooms (which are sensitive to changes in climatic conditions) therefore 
  may amplify <i>V. cholerae </i>and enhance transmission (Epstein, 2000). Furthermore,<i> 
  V. cholerae</i> follows a salinity gradient, which might bring the disease to 
  new shores if sea level rises (WHO, 1998).</p>
<p>In 1998, Ecuador's vulnerability to cholera increased as a result of climatic 
  phenomena (OPS, 1999). In 1997-1998 in Peru, the same areas affected by 
  climatic phenomena showed an increase in cholera cases, probably as a result 
  of floods, problems with drainage, and food contamination in shelters (OPS, 
  1999). In Peru, persistence in transmission of diarrheal diseases such as <i>Salmonella 
  typhi</i> and cholera was related to changes in environmental, climatic, and 
  sanitary conditions (Carrillo, 1991a,b).</p>
<p>Floods foster fungal growth and provide new breeding sites for mosquitoes, 
  whereas droughts concentrate microorganisms and encourage aphids, locusts, and 
  whiteflies and&#151;when interrupted by sudden rains&#151;may spur explosions 
  of rodent populations (Epstein and Chikwenhere, 1994). </p>
<p>The first recorded outbreak of Weil's disease (leptospirosis) in Colombia 
  occurred mainly in children from poor neighborhoods. Symptoms of leptospirosis 
  are similar to those of dengue, and the former can be fatal rapidly in patients 
  not receiving proper treatment. The probable agents and disease seem to be linked 
  with rodents escaping from floods (Epstein <i>et al.,</i> 1995).</p>
<p>In Cuba, acute diarrheal diseases occur more often during the warm and rainy 
  period, when ecological conditions are favorable for reproduction of bacteria, 
  viruses, and protozoa. Acute respiratory infection reports diminish after climatic 
  conditions become warmer, more humid, and thermally less contrasting (Ortiz 
  <i>et al., </i>1998). In Mexico, some rain in semi-arid zones has caused bubonic 
  plague outbreaks (Parmenter <i>et al.,</i> 1999).</p>
