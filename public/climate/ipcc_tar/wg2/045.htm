<h2>5.5. Latin America </h2>
<p>There is ample evidence of climate variability at a wide range of time scales 
  all over Latin America, from intraseasonal to long-term. In many subregions 
  of Latin America, this variability in climate normally is associated with phenomena 
  that already produce impacts with important socioeconomic and environmental 
  consequences that could be exacerbated by global warming and its associated 
  weather and climate changes. </p>
<p>Variations in precipitation have a strong effect on runoff and streamflow, 
  which are simultaneously affected by melting of glaciers and snow. Precipitation 
  variations and their sign depend on the geographical subregion under consideration. 
  Temperature in Latin America also varies among subregions. Although these variations 
  might depend on the origin and quality of the source data as well as on the 
  record periods used for studies and analyses, some of these variations could 
  be attributed to a climate change condition (low confidence). [<a href="519.htm#14121">14.1.2.1</a>]</p>
<p><i>ENSO is responsible for a large part of the climate variability at interannual 
  scales in Latin America (high confidence).</i> The region is vulnerable to El 
  Ni&ntilde;o, with impacts varying across the continent. For example, El Ni&ntilde;o 
  is associated with dry conditions in northeast Brazil, northern Amazonia, the 
  Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano, and the Pacific coast of Central America. The most 
  severe droughts in Mexico in recent decades have occurred during El Ni&ntilde;o 
  years, whereas southern Brazil and northwestern Peru have exhibited anomalously 
  wet conditions. La Ni&ntilde;a is associated with heavy precipitation and flooding 
  in Colombia and drought in southern Brazil. If El Ni&ntilde;o or La Ni&ntilde;a 
  were to increase, Latin America would be exposed to these conditions more often. 
  [<a href="519.htm">14.1.2</a>]</p>
<p>Some subregions of Latin America frequently experience extreme events, and 
  these extraordinary combinations of hydrological and climatic conditions historically 
  have produced disasters in Latin America. Tropical cyclones and associated heavy 
  rain, flooding, and landslides are very common in Central America and southern 
  Mexico. In northwestern South America and northeastern Brazil, many of the extremes 
  that occur are strongly related to El Ni&ntilde;o. [<a href="519.htm">14.1.2</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="551"></a>5.5.1. Water Resources </h3>
<p><i>It has been well established that glaciers in Latin America have receded 
  in the past several decades. Warming in high mountain regions could lead to 
  disappearance of significant snow and ice surface (medium confidence)</i>, which 
  could affect mountain sport and tourist activities. Because these areas contribute 
  to river streamflow, this trend also would reduce water availability for irrigation, 
  hydropower generation, and navigation. [<a href="538.htm#1424">14.2.4</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="552"></a>5.5.2. Ecosystems</h3>
<p><i>It is well established that Latin America accounts for one of the Earth's 
  largest concentrations of biodiversity, and the impacts of climate change can 
  be expected to increase the risk of biodiversity loss (high confidence).</i> 
  Observed population declines in frogs and small mammals in Central America can 
  be related to regional climate change. The remaining Amazonian forest is threatened 
  by the combination of human disturbance, increases in fire frequency and scale, 
  and decreased precipitation from evapotranspiration loss, global warming, and 
  El Ni&ntilde;o. Neotropical seasonally dry forest should be considered severely 
  threatened in Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>Tree mortality increases under dry conditions that prevail near newly formed 
  edges in Amazonian forests. Edges, which affect an increasingly large portion 
  of the forest because of increased deforestation, would be especially susceptible 
  to the effects of reduced rainfall. In Mexico, nearly 50% of the deciduous tropical 
  forest would be affected. Heavy rain during the 1997-1998 ENSO event generated 
  drastic changes in dry ecosystems of northern Peru's coastal zone. Global warming 
  would expand the area suitable for tropical forests as equilibrium vegetation 
  types. However, the forces driving deforestation make it unlikely that tropical 
  forests will be permitted to occupy these increased areas. Land-use change interacts 
  with climate through positive-feedback processes that accelerate loss of humid 
  tropical forests. [<a href="529.htm">14.2.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="553"></a>5.5.3. Sea-Level Rise </h3>
<p><i>Sea-level rise will affect mangrove ecosystems by eliminating their present 
  habitats and creating new tidally inundated areas to which some mangrove species 
  may shift.</i> This also would affect the region's fisheries because most commercial 
  shellfish and finfish use mangroves for nurseries and refuge. Coastal inundation 
  that stems from sea-level rise and riverine and flatland flooding would affect 
  water availability and agricultural land, exacerbating socioeconomic and health 
  problems in these areas. [<a href="536.htm">14.2.3</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="554"></a>5.5.4. Agriculture</h3>
<p><i>Studies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay&#151;based on GCMs 
  and crop models&#151;project decreased yields for numerous crops (e.g., maize, 
  wheat, barley, grapes) even when the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization and 
  implementation of moderate adaptation measures at the farm level are considered 
  (high confidence).</i> Predicted increases in temperature will reduce crops 
  yields in the region by shortening the crop cycle. Over the past 40 years, the 
  contribution of agriculture to the GDP of Latin American countries has been 
  on the order of 10%. Agriculture remains a key sector in the regional economy 
  because it employs 30-40% of the economically active population. It also 
  is very important for the food security of the poorest sectors of the population. 
  Subsistence farming could be severely threatened in some parts of Latin America, 
  including northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is established but incomplete that climate change would reduce silvicultural 
  yields because lack of water often limits growth during the dry season, which 
  is expected to become longer and more intense in many parts of Latin America. 
  <a href="#tabts11">Table TS-11</a> summarizes studies undertaken on the region 
  for different crops and management conditions, all under rainfed conditions; 
  most of these results predict negative impacts, particularly for maize. [<a href="533.htm">14.2.2</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="555"></a>5.5.5. Human Health </h3>
<p><i>The scale of health impacts from climate change in Latin America would depend 
  primarily on the size, density, location, and wealth of populations. Exposure 
  to heat or cold waves has impacts on mortality rates in risk groups in the region 
  (medium confidence). </i></p>
<p>Increases in temperature would affect human health in polluted cities such 
  as Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. It is well established that ENSO causes 
  changes in disease vector populations and in the incidence of water-borne diseases 
  in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Venezuela. Studies in Peru and Cuba 
  indicate that increases in temperature and precipitation would change the geographical 
  distribution of infectious diseases such as cholera and meningitis (high confidence), 
  although there is speculation about what the changes in patterns of diseases 
  would be in different places. It is well established that extreme events tend 
  to increase death and morbidity rates (injuries, infectious diseases, social 
  problems, and damage to sanitary infrastructure), as shown in Central America 
  with Hurricane Mitch in 1998, heavy rains in Mexico and Venezuela in 1999, and 
  in Chile and Argentina in 2000. [<a href="539.htm">14.2.5</a>]</p>
