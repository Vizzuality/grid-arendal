<h3><a name="1974"></a>19.7.4. Aggregate Approaches </h3>
<p>Advantages: Aggregate analyses synthesize climate change impacts in an internally 
  consistent manner, using relatively comprehensive global indicators or metrics. 
  These often are expressed in U.S. dollars (e.g., Tol, 2001b) or other common 
  metrics such as changes in vegetation cover (Alcamo et al., 1998). This enables 
  direct comparisons of impacts among sector systems and regions and with other 
  environmental problems and emission control costs. Some aggregate analyses have 
  assessed differences in relative impacts in developed and developing regions 
  of the world and have shown that regional differences in impacts may be substantial. 
</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Aggregate analyses lack richness of detail. Partly this is inherent 
  because aggregation explicitly seeks to synthesize complex information. Partly 
  this is because aggregate analyses tend to rely on reduced-form models. Condensing 
  the diverse pattern of impacts into a small number of damage indicators is difficult. 
  Some metrics may not accurately capture the value of certain impacts; for example, 
  nonmarket impacts such as mortality and loss of species diversity or cultural 
  heritage often are not well captured in monetization approaches, and change 
  in vegetation cover may not clearly indicate threats to biodiversity. Other 
  complicating issues concern comparison of impacts across time (impact today 
  and several generations from now) and between regions (e.g., impact in developing 
  and developed countries), as well as how much importance to assign to different 
  effects. In addition, many aggregate studies examine a static world rather than 
  a dynamic one and do not consider the effects of changes in extreme events or 
  large-scale discontinuities. The aggregation process is not possible without 
  value judgments, and different ethical views imply different aggregate measures 
  across socioeconomic groupings and generations (see Azar and Sterner, 1996; 
  Fankhauser et al., 1997). Choice of discount rates can affect valuation of damages. 
  In addition, general shortcomings that affect all reasons for concern are particularly 
  prominent in aggregate analysis (e.g., accounting for baseline development, 
  changes in variability and extreme events, and costs and benefits of adaptation). 
</p>
<p>Uncertainties: Uncertainties include whether all climate change impacts (positive 
  and negative) are included, the implications of various aggregation and valuation 
  methods, and implicit or explicit assumptions of methods, including possible 
  mis-specifications of nonlinearities and interaction effects.</p>
<p>Research Needs: The next generation of aggregate estimates will have to account 
  better for baseline developments, transient effects, climate variations, and 
  multiple stresses. Further progress also is still needed in the treatment of 
  adaptation. A broader set of primary studies on impacts in developing countries 
  and nonmarket sectors would reduce the need for difficult extrapolation. More 
  work also is needed on the ethical underpinnings of aggregation and on alternative 
  aggregation schemes. Work on reflecting information from the other reasons for 
  concern into the aggregate approach is underway, but proceeding slowly.</p>
<h3><a name="1975"></a>19.7.5. Integrated Assessment Frameworks</h3>
<p>Advantages: Integrated assessment frameworks or models provide a means of structuring 
  the enormous amount of and often conflicting data available from disaggregated 
  studies. They offer internally consistent and globally comprehensive analysis 
  of impacts; provide "vertical integration" (i.e., cover the entire 
  "causal chain" from socioeconomic activities giving rise to GHG emissions 
  to concentration, climate, impacts, and adaptations); provide "horizontal 
  integration" (i.e., account for interlinkages between different impact 
  categories, adaptations, and exogenous factors such as economic development 
  and population growth); and allow for consistent treatment of uncertainties. 
  IAMs have been used primarily for benefit-cost and inverse (or threshold) analyses. 
  The latter have the advantage of being directly related to Article 2 because 
  they define impacts that may be considered "dangerous" (through specification 
  of thresholds related to, e.g., harm to unique and threatened systems or the 
  probability of large-scale discontinuities).</p>
<p>Disadvantages: The main disadvantages with most IAMs are those associated with 
  aggregate approaches: reliance on a single or a limited number of universal 
  measures of impacts. These may not adequately measure impacts in meaningful 
  ways. This is partly because IAMs rely on reduced-form equations to represent 
  the complexities of more detailed models. Their usefulness is highly dependent 
  on how well they are able to capture the complexities of more disaggregated 
  approaches. Some of the IAMs used for benefit-cost analyses have considered 
  large-scale irregularities (e.g., Gjerde et al., 1999), but inclusion of such 
  outcomes is preliminary. Few have accounted for loss of or substantial harm 
  to unique and threatened systems. Although inverse (or threshold) approaches 
  allow researchers to overcome these problems, the disadvantages of this kind 
  of analysis include the difficulty of explicitly specifying thresholds and combining 
  them within and across sectors and regions.</p>
<p>Uncertainties: Uncertainties are the same as those for the aggregate approach 
  or for unique and threatened systems, depending on the structure and objectives 
  of the model. This also would include the effects of different assumptions, 
  methods, and value choices.</p>
<p>Research Needs: Among the biggest challenges facing integrated assessment modelers 
  (see Weyant et al., 1996) are developing a credible way to represent and value 
  the impacts of climate change; a credible way to handle low-probability but 
  potentially catastrophic events; a credible way to incorporate changes in extreme 
  weather events; and realistic representations of changes in socioeconomic and 
  institutional conditions, particularly in developing countries. In addition, 
  they must decide how to allow explicitly for effects of different value choices, 
  systems, and assumptions; how to quantify uncertainties; and how to credibly 
  incorporate planned adaptation, including costs and limitations. </p>
<h3><a name="1976"></a>19.7.6. Extreme Events</h3>
<p>Advantages: Extreme events are recognized as major contributors to the impacts 
  of climate variability now and to potential impacts of climate change in the 
  future. Thus, realistic climate change impact assessments must take them into 
  account even though they may change in complex ways&#151;such as in frequency, 
  magnitude, location, and sequences (e.g., increased variability may lead to 
  more frequent floods and droughts). Better understanding of changes in extreme 
  events and adaptation measures for coping with them also will help in coping 
  with present variability.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Extreme events are more difficult to model and characterize 
  than average climates. Changes in extreme events will be complex and uncertain, 
  in part because extremes occur in a chaotic manner even in the present climate. 
  Large data series are needed to characterize their occurrence because, by definition, 
  they are rare events. This means that long time scale model simulations are 
  needed to develop relevant statistics from long time slices or multiple realizations. 
  Extreme events need to be considered in terms of probabilities or risks of occurrence 
  rather than predictions. This chaotic element adds to other sources of uncertainty. 
  It means that engineering or other design standards based on climatology that 
  normally use long data series of observations will need a synthetic data set 
  that simulates potential changes in future climate. It also makes adaptation 
  to changes in extremes more difficult because planned adaptation must rely on 
  necessarily uncertain projections into the future from theory and thus requires 
  greater faith in the science before the information will be acted on.</p>
<p>Uncertainties and Research Needs: Better knowledge of the behavior of extremes 
  will require long or multiple simulations at finer spatial and temporal scales, 
  to capture the scale, intensity, and frequency of the events. Some types of 
  extreme events (e.g., hail and extreme wind bursts) are poorly simulated at 
  present; others, such as ENSO and tropical cyclones, are extremely complex and 
  only now are beginning to be better simulated. Arguments for changes in their 
  behavior are still often largely theoretical, qualitative, or circumstantial, 
  rather than well based in verified models. Moreover, much more work is needed 
  on how they will affect natural and human systems and how much of the recent 
  trend to greater damages from extreme events is related to changes in exposure 
  (e.g., greater populations, larger investments, more insurance cover, or greater 
  reporting) rather than changes in the number and intensity of those extremes. 
  More work is needed on how best to adapt to changes in extreme events, especially 
  on how planners and decisionmakers can best take information on projected changes 
  in extremes into consideration. This may be done best by focusing on projected 
  change in the risk of exceeding prescribed natural, engineering, or socioeconomic 
  impacts thresholds.</p>
<h3><a name="1977"></a>19.7.7. Large-Scale Singular Events</h3>
<p>Advantages: Consideration of strongly nonlinear or even disruptive effects 
  accompanying climate change is a critical component of the "dangerous interference" 
  debate. The basic idea is to corroborate any non-negligible probability for 
  high-consequence impacts that may be triggered by human climate perturbations. 
  The political process to avoid high-consequence impacts may be facilitated by 
  the global scope of such effects (e.g., disintegration of the WAIS generating 
  a planetary sea-level rise of approximately 5m). Inclusion of extreme events 
  in the analysis helps, in general, to pursue all other reasons for concern in 
  a realistic way because irregular impacts may dominate impacts on unique and 
  threatened systems, distributional impacts, and aggregate impacts.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: This is an emerging area of research, facing several serious 
  challenges because of the complexity of nonlinear interactions to be considered. 
  The prevailing lack of knowledge is reflected in use of the term "surprises" 
  for disruptive events. The potentials for climate change-induced transformations 
  of extreme events regimes and for large-scale discontinuities in the Earth system 
  are still highly uncertain. The search for irregularities might turn out to 
  be futile and distract scientific resources from other important topics, such 
  as the distributional aspects of regular climate change impacts.</p>
<p>Uncertainties and Research Needs: By definition, uncertainties are most severe 
  in this realm of impact research. At present, there is no way of estimating 
  the probabilities of certain disruptive events or assigning confidence levels 
  to those probabilities. As a consequence, a strong research program should be 
  launched that combines the best paleoclimate observations with the strongest 
  simulation models representing full and intermediate complexity. </p>
<h3><a name="1978"></a>19.7.8. Looking across Analytic Approaches</h3>
<p>Looking across the different analytic approaches (implicitly, the different 
  reasons for concern), it is clear that to a great extent they complement and 
  in many respects do not overlap each other. Combining these approaches into 
  an integrated framework is the ambition of IAMs, at least in principle. However, 
  this process is just starting. Because observed evidence has not been incorporated 
  in the other analytic approaches, impacts to unique and threatened systems have 
  not been accounted for in aggregate and IAM approaches, they are difficult to 
  sum, and large-scale irregular impacts have only begun to be addressed, it does 
  not appear to be feasible yet to combine these approaches into a comprehensive 
  analytic approach. Thus, those who are seeking to implement climate policies 
  must currently do their own integration of information from the alternative 
  lines of inquiry.</p>
