<h3>4.6.5. Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector: an Overview</h3>
<p>Water managers are accustomed to adapting to changing circumstances, many of 
  which can be regarded as analogs of future climate change, and a wide range 
  of adaptive options has been developed. Supply-side options are more familiar 
  to most water managers, but demand-side options increasingly are being implemented. 
  Water management is evolving continually, and this evolution will affect the 
  impact of climate change in practice. For reasons noted above, climate change 
  is likely to challenge existing water management practices, especially in countries 
  with less experience in incorporating uncertainty into water planning. The generic 
  issue is incorporation of climate change into the types of uncertainty traditionally 
  treated in water planning.</p>
<p>Integrated water resources management (IWRM) (Bogardi and Nachtnebel, 1994; 
  Kindler, 2000) increasingly is regarded as the most effective way to manage 
  water resources in a changing environment with competing demands. IWRM essentially 
  involves three major components: explicit consideration of all potential supply-side 
  and demand-side actions, inclusion of all stakeholders in the decision process, 
  and continual monitoring and review of the water resources situation. IWRM is 
  an effective approach in the absence of climate change, and there already are 
  many good reasons for it to be implemented. Adopting integrated water resources 
  management will go a long way toward increasing the ability of water managers 
  to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>There are three final points to make:</p>
<ol>
  <li>&#147;Upstream&#148; adaptation may have implications for &#147;downstream&#148; 
    uses. In other words, the impact of climate change on one user may be very 
    much determined by the actions of other users in response to climate change. 
    This emphasizes the need for basin-scale management.<br>
  </li>
  <li> The emphasis in this section has been on managed water systems. In many 
    countries, particularly in rural parts of the developing world, water supply 
    is &#147;managed&#148; at the household level, utilizing local water sources. 
    There is a need to look at the implications of climate change in circumstances 
    of this type in which investment in substantial infrastructure is unlikely.</li>
  <li>Adaptation to climate change to reduce vulnerability in the water sector 
    should involve far more than just water managers. Increasing social vulnerability 
    to water stress (in terms of drought and flood) in many parts of the world 
    reflects a wide range of pressures, many of which are outside the responsibility 
    of water managers. Reducing vulnerability to climate change-induced flood 
    and drought will require decisions about issues such as development and planning 
    control, fiscal incentives (such as subsidized insurance or government disaster 
    relief) to occupy (and continue to occupy after loss) hazard-prone land, and 
    wealth enhancement</li>
</ol>
