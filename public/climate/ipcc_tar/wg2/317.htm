<p>Most urban authorities in developing regions have very little investment capacity 
  despite rapid growth in their populations and the need for infrastructure. Problems 
  arise from inadequate and inappropriate planning for settlements. Yet the need 
  for planning becomes even more pressing in light of increased social, economic, 
  and environmental impacts of urbanization; growing consumption levels; and renewed 
  concern for sustainable development since the adoption of Agenda 21 (UNCHS, 
  1996). Environmental management tends to be more difficult in very large cities 
  (WRI, 1996). Although there are commitments from developed countries in Article 
  4.4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to 
  assist particularly vulnerable countries with adaptation, the financial resources 
  needed to provide services to tens of millions of people are daunting. </p>
<p>Increasingly, settlements are exchanging ideas concerning methods and experiences 
  for community design and management to improve sustainability and livability. 
  For example, ICLEI is an association of local governments dedicated to prevention 
  and solution of local, regional, and global environmental problems through local 
  action. More than 300 cities, towns, counties, and their associations from around 
  the world are members of the Council (ICLEI, 1995). </p>
<p>Environmentally sound land-use planning is central to achievement of healthy, 
  productive, and socially accountable human settlements within societies whose 
  draw on natural resources and ecosystems is sustainable. The challenge is not 
  only how to direct and contain urban growth but also how to mobilize human, 
  financial, and technical resources to ensure that social, economic, and environmental 
  needs are addressed adequately (UNCHS, 1996). </p>
