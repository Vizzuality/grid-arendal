<h3>7.2.2 Sensitivity and Vulnerability of Human Settlements to Direct and Indirect 
  Impacts of Climate Change </h3>
<p>This chapter highlights some of the key processes through which climate impacts 
  could occur; individual regional chapters categorize settlements based on size, 
  location, or complete coverage of the population. </p>
<p>As a result of research that has been done on settlements since the SAR and 
  RICC, as well as additional interpretation of older research, it is becoming 
  clearer where many of the key vulnerabilities of human settlements, energy, 
  and industry occur, although it is still very difficult to provide more than 
  qualitative guidance. <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> provides an overview 
  of these vulnerabilities for the years between approximately 2050 and 2080; 
  much of the available literature concentrates on the effects of climate change 
  of a magnitude roughly corresponding to that time period. The table divides 
  human settlements into general size categories and economic function in a hierarchy 
  of settlements. The table emphasizes the most salient effects that appear to 
  be characteristic of certain types of settlements and mechanisms that might 
  make the settlements more or less sensitive to climate change. </p>
<p>Implications of climate change for development of settlements, energy, and 
  industry are highly location-specific. For instance, as shown in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 
  7-1</a>, climate change is more likely to have important impacts on the development 
  of settlements in resource-dependent regions or coastal or riverine locations. 
  Most of the concerns are about possible negative impacts on development (e.g., 
  on the comparative advantage of a settlement for economic growth compared with 
  other locations), although impacts on some areas are likely to be positive. 
  Impacts on sustainability depend very largely on how climate change interacts 
  with other processes related to multiple stresses and opportunities-such as 
  economic, demographic, and technological change-except in low-lying areas that 
  may be subject to sea-level rise or polar regions whose physical conditions 
  will be more directly affected by global warming. Equity effects are of considerable 
  concern because the ability to cope with negative impacts or to take advantage 
  of positive impacts is likely to be greater among advantaged groups than among 
  disadvantaged groups, within regions and between regions. As a result, climate 
  change has the potential to enlarge equity-related gaps in human settlements 
  and systems. </p>
<p>In general, country studies that have been completed since the SAR was published 
  have provided more specific regional details concerning sensitivities and vulnerabilities 
  to climate change (e.g., IPCC, 1998; see <a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>). 
  Because of variability in settlements across the world, it is virtually impossible 
  to create rankings of impacts that do not contain numerous exceptions. However, 
  the impact ratings in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> provide a framework 
  that can be adapted to local circumstances. <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> 
  shows the author team's judgments, based on the available literature, about 
  the vulnerability of different types of settlement to various aspects of climate 
  change. The horizontal axis differentiates vulnerability according to type of 
  settlement, capacity to adapt, and the mechanism through which the settlement 
  is affected by climate change. For example, the resource base of settlements 
  that are economically dependent on activities such as agriculture, forestry, 
  fishing, hunting and gathering, or tourism may be affected; housing and infrastructure 
  may be affected in coastal areas, riverine floodplains, islands that are sensitive 
  to flooding, steeplands that are sensitive to landslides, and urban/wildland 
  boundaries that are sensitive to fires; and the health and productivity of urban 
  populations may be affected directly through air pollution, heat waves, and 
  heat island effects. The vertical axis identifies 12 different types of climate 
  change impact in descending order of global importance. Vulnerabilities are 
  rated as low, medium, or high magnitude as described in <a href="#box71">Box 
  7-1</a>. The information in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> generally 
  is presented as a range, reflecting the diversity of settlements within each 
  broad class. The final column shows the level of confidence that the author 
  team assigns to each type of climate impact. <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> 
  depicts vulnerabilities for the years between approximately 2050 and 2080. Much 
  of the available human settlements literature is silent on the timing of impacts; 
  the choice of the years 2050-2080 in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> is 
  based on the size of the impacts or amount of climate change addressed in the 
  literature reviewed by the author team. <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> 
  takes into account the number and type of settlements affected worldwide and 
  the likely strength of these effects by mid-to-late 21st century, as well as 
  the financial, technical, and institutional capacity of settlements to respond. 
  <a href="310.htm#fig72">Figure 7-2</a> provides confidence scores for the impacts 
  on individual scales described more fully in <a href="#box71">Box 7-1</a> (see 
  also Moss and Schneider, 2000). </p>
<p>The negative impacts in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> generally would 
  be less negative or even positive in some regions before 2050 but greater than 
  shown and becoming more negative in more regions after 2100. The table is not 
  intended to show that only specific types of settlements would be harmed (or 
  helped) in certain ways by certain changes; it is intended to show that settlements 
  of certain types probably are likely to be affected by certain impact mechanisms 
  and are likely to be particularly vulnerable to certain types of climate changes 
  or conditions. </p>
<p>Many of the effects in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a> are quite likely 
  for some communities in some places; other effects are extremely uncertain, 
  controversial, or inapplicable. Key articles that underlie the ratings are provided 
  as footnotes to <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 7-1</a>. </p>
<p>Confidence in the main conclusions of this chapter in <a href="308.htm#tab71">Table 
  7-1</a> is rated in <a href="310.htm#fig72">Figure 7-2</a> from very high (5) 
  to very low (1) in four dimensions: support from theory, support from model 
  results, support from data or trends in the existing environment, and the degree 
  of consensus in expert opinion. Although these ratings reflect the subjective 
  judgments of the chapter's authors concerning the weight that can be given to 
  each element that increases confidence in the findings, the figure is useful 
  in depicting the dimensions of the underlying literature that are particularly 
  strong or weak in support of the chapter's conclusions. Confidence levels vary 
  widely: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Results that are very high on all dimensions, as in the expected vulnerability 
    of at least some coastal settlements to sea-level rise <br>
  <li>Results that are very strong on most dimensions, such as local capacity 
    being very important in practice for successful adaptation to environmental 
    problems (even though the theory has not really been applied to climate change) 
    <br>
  <li>Results that are very high on one or two dimensions, such as human health 
    effects, where theory and model results are strongly supportive of the conclusion, 
    whereas data are weaker or ambiguous and experts are somewhat divided <br>
  <li>Results for which there is some evidence, but most of it is only modestly 
    supportive; one or two modestly strong elements lead to the conclusion, but 
    confidence is weak.

      <p><b>Box 7-1. Development of Scales for Assessing Potential Vulnerability 
        of Human Settlements to Effects of Climate Change and Confidence in the 
        Certainty of Impacts </b></p>
      <p>Climate affects the stability of resources that support human systems. 
        One way to assess the potential impact of climate change on human systems 
        is by using a qualitative scale that expresses the vulnerability of settlements 
        to various kinds of climate effects (e.g., floods) in terms of how potentially 
        disruptive these climate effects are expected to be for various types 
        of human settlements (based on differences in their economic base, location, 
        size, and adaptability). The definitions in the rating system below are 
        derived from standard environmental impact assessment language and are 
        intended to apply to local climate impacts. However, the scale may be 
        used nationally if the nation is small and homogeneous or if most of the 
        population lives in settlements of a certain type. </p>
      <p><b><i>Magnitude Ratings (Size of Impacts)</i></b></p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Low: Impacts of changed climate are not distinguishable from normal 
          background variability in weather impacts or there is little noticeable 
          effect. 
        <li>Moderate: Resources or sectors are affected noticeably, even substantially, 
          but the effect is not destabilizing and recovery is rapid. 
        <li>High: Impacts are large and sometimes catastrophic. Resources or settlements 
          are destabilized, with little hope for near-term recovery. 
      </ul>
      <p>A semi-quantitative approach is used with a 5-point confidence scale 
        to indicate the certainty of the effects of climate change. The author 
        team subjectively rated confidence on the basis of the literature in four 
        dimensions: consensus among experts (consensus), the extent to which underlying 
        theory and data is developed (theory), the quality of model results (model 
        results), and the consistency of observational evidence (observations). 
        The scores were used to create a four-sided polygon, as shown in Figure 
        7-2 on the facing page. All four dimensions were weighted equally to determine 
        the area of the polygon and an overall confidence score. </p>
      <p> <i>Polygon Area = 0.5 . (Theory . Observations + Observations . Model 
        Results + Model Results . Consensus + Consensus . Theory) </i></p>
      <p>The overall confidence score assigned was based on the area of the polygon. 
        For example, to rate a 4 for "high confidence," the polygon had to have 
        an area between 16 and 25-the area of a polygon with ratings of greater 
        than 4 but less than 5 on all four dimensions. </p>
      <p><b><i>Confidence Rating (Certainty of Impacts) </i></b></p>
      <p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Very Low: Impacts are extremely difficult to predict (confidence < 
          5%) (Polygon Area = 0-8). 
        <li>Low: Impacts are regularly much greater or less than the median value 
          (confidence < 33%) (Polygon Area = 8-18). 
        <li> Medium: Impacts are regularly greater or less than the median value 
          (confidence Z 33%) (Polygon Area = 18-32). 
        <li>High: There is noticeable variation in the size of impacts (confidence 
          Z 67%) (Polygon Area = 32-50). 
        <li>Very High: There is little variation in impact among scenarios, within 
          a settlement type (confidence = 95%) (Polygon Area = 50).
