<h2>3.1. Definitions and Role of Scenarios</h2>
<h3>3.1.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>This chapter examines the development and application of scenarios required 
  for assessment of climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. Scenarios 
  are one of the main tools for assessment of future developments in complex systems 
  that often are inherently unpredictable, are insufficiently understood, and 
  have high scientific uncertainties. The central goals of the chapter are to 
  set out the different approaches to scenario use, to evaluate the strengths 
  and weaknesses of these approaches, and to highlight key issues relating to 
  scenario application that should be considered in conducting future assessments.<br>
</p>
<p>Recognizing the central role of scenarios in impact and adaptation studies, 
  scenarios are treated separately for the first time by Working Group II.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  This chapter builds on <a href="491.htm">Chapter 13</a> of the WGI contribution 
  to the Third Assessment Report (TAR), which describes construction of climate 
  scenarios, by embracing scenarios that portray future developments of any factor 
  (climatic or otherwise) that might have a bearing on climate change vulnerability, 
  impacts, and adaptive capacity. A distinction is drawn between climate scenarios, 
  which describe the forcing factor of key interest in this report, and nonclimatic 
  scenarios (e.g., of projected socioeconomic, technological, land-use, and other 
  environmental changes), which provide the "context"&#151;a description of a 
  future world on which the climate operates. Many early impact assessments tended 
  to focus on climate forcing without properly considering the context, even though 
  this might have an important or even dominant role in determining future vulnerability 
  to climate.<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to serving studies of impacts, scenarios are vital aids in evaluating 
  options for mitigating future emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, 
  which are known to affect global climate. For instance, projections of future 
  socioeconomic and technological developments are as essential for obtaining 
  scenarios of future emissions as they are for evaluating future vulnerability 
  to climate (see <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). 
  Thus, although the focus of this chapter is on the development and use of scenarios 
  in impact and adaptation assessment, reference to scenarios that have been developed 
  for purposes of addressing mitigation is important and unavoidable.</p>
<p>There is a varied lexicon for describing future worlds under a changing climate; 
  alternative terms often reflect differing disciplinary origins. Therefore, for 
  the sake of consistency in this chapter, working definitions of several terms 
  are presented in <a href="#box31">Box 3-1</a>.</p>
<a name="box31"></a>
<table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

      <div align="center"><b>Box 3-1. Definitions </b> </div>
      <p><b>Projection</b>. The term "projection" is used in two senses 
        in this chapter. In general usage, a projection can be regarded as any 
        description of the future and the pathway leading to it. However, a more 
        specific interpretation was attached to the term "climate projection" 
        throughout the Second Assessment Report (SAR) to refer to model-derived 
        estimates of future climate.</p>
      <p><b>Forecast/Prediction</b>. When a projection is branded "most likely," 
        it becomes a forecast or prediction. A forecast is often obtained by using 
        deterministic models&#151;possibly a set of such models&#151;outputs of 
        which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.</p>
      <p><b>Scenario</b>. A scenario is a coherent, internally consistent, and 
        plausible description of a possible future state of the world (IPCC, 1994). 
        It is not a forecast; each scenario is one alternative image of how the 
        future can unfold. A projection may serve as the raw material for a scenario, 
        but scenarios often require additional information (e.g., about baseline 
        conditions). A set of scenarios often is adopted to reflect, as well as 
        possible, the range of uncertainty in projections. Indeed, it has been 
        argued that if probabilities can be assigned to such a range (while acknowledging 
        that significant unquantifiable uncertainties outside the range remain), 
        a new descriptor is required that is intermediate between scenario and 
        forecast (Jones, 2000). Other terms that have been used as synonyms for 
        scenario are "characterization" (cf. <a href="154.htm">Section 
        3.8</a>), "storyline" (cf. <a href="127.htm">Section 3.2</a>), 
        and<br>
        "construction."</p>
      <p><b>Baseline/Reference</b>. The baseline (or reference) is any datum against 
        which change is measured. It might be a "current baseline," 
        in which case it represents observable, present-day conditions. It also 
        might be a "future baseline," which is a projected </p>

<h3><a name="312"></a>3.1.2. Function of Scenarios in Impact and Adaptation Assessment<br>
</h3>
<p>Selection and application of baseline and scenario data occupy central roles 
  in most standard methodological frameworks for conducting climate change impact 
  and adaptation assessment (e.g., WCC, 1993, 1994; IPCC, 1994; Smith <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; Feenstra <i>et al</i>., 1998; see <a href="070.htm">Section 2.1</a>). 
  Many assessments treat scenarios exogenously, as an input, specifying key future 
  socioeconomic and environmental baselines of importance for an exposure unit,<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  possibly with some aspects of adaptation potential also considered. Other assessments&#151;especially 
  those that use integrated assessment models (IAMs)&#151;generate projections 
  (e.g., of emissions, concentrations, climate, sea level) endogenously as outcomes, 
  requiring only prior specification of the key driving variables (e.g., economic 
  development, population). Outputs from such assessments might be applied themselves 
  as scenarios for downstream analysis. Moreover, in IAMs, some of the original 
  driving variables may be modified through modeled feedbacks.<br>
  <br>
  Scenarios are widely used in climate change-related assessments. For some uses, 
  scenarios are qualitative constructions that are intended to challenge people 
  to think about a range of alternative futures that might go beyond conventional 
  expectations or "business as usual" (BAU). Some of the socioeconomic 
  and technological assumptions underlying GHG emissions scenarios are of this 
  type (see <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/068.htm">Chapter 2</a>). 
  For other uses, scenarios may be mainly quantitative, derived by running models 
  on the basis of a range of different input assumptions. Most assessments of 
  the impacts of future climate change are based on results from impact models 
  that rely on quantitative climate and nonclimatic scenarios as inputs. Some 
  scenario exercises blend the two approaches. However, not all impact assessments 
  require a scenario component; in some cases, it may be sufficient that system 
  sensitivities are explored without making any assumptions about the future.</p>
<h3><a name="313"></a>3.1.3. Approaches to Scenario Development and Application</h3>
The approaches employed to construct scenarios vary according to the purpose of 
an assessment. For instance, scenarios may be required for: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Illustrating climate change (e.g., by depicting the future climate expected 
    in a given region in terms of the present-day climate currently experienced 
    in a familiar neighboring region)</li>
  <li>Communicating potential consequences of climate change (e.g., by specifying 
    a future changed climate to estimate potential future shifts in natural vegetation 
    and identifying species at risk of local extinction)</li>
  <li>Strategic planning (e.g., by quantifying possible future sea-level and climate 
    changes to design effective coastal or river flood defenses)</li>
  <li>Guiding emissions control policy (e.g., by specifying alternative socioeconomic 
    and technological options for achieving some prespecified GHG concentrations)</li>
  <li>Methodological purposes (e.g., by describing altered conditions, using a 
    new scenario development technique, or to evaluate the performance of impact 
    models).</li>
</ul>
<p>A broad distinction can be drawn between exploratory scenarios, which project 
  anticipated futures, and normative scenarios, which project prescribed futures. 
  In practice, however, many scenarios embrace aspects of both approaches.</p>
