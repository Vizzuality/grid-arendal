<h4>5.4.4.2. Captive Breeding and Translocations</h4>
<p>Another way in which humans have dealt with endangered wildlife populations 
  has been through captive breeding and translocations. These techniques have 
  been put forward in the past as methods to deal with future population pressures 
  caused by climate change (Peters, 1992). However, although captive breeding 
  and translocation are effective tools for conservation of some species, they 
  may be appropriate for only a handful of species (see <a href="#box58">Box 5-8</a>).</p>
<a name="box58"></a> 
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td class="box"> 
      <div align="center"><b>Box 5-8. Limitations of Captive Breeding and Translocation 
        to Conserve Biological Diversity Threatened by Climate Change </b> </div>
      <p>In some cases, threatened populations of sensitive species could be augmented 
        or reestablished through captive breeding for reintroduction, especially 
        if the degree of climate change proves to be small or moderate. In combination 
        with habitat restoration, such efforts may be successful in preventing 
        the extinction of small numbers of key selected taxa. Similarly, translocation 
        of wildlife between areas within their natural range also might mitigate 
        the effects of small to moderate climate change. This strategy has been 
        applied successfully to augment or restore depleted populations of various 
        species (Boyer and Brown, 1988). </p>
      <p>Captive breeding for reintroduction and translocation are likely to be 
        less successful if climate change is more dramatic. Such change could 
        result in large-scale modifications of environmental conditions, including 
        loss or significant alteration of existing habitat over some or all of 
        a species' range (Myers et al., 2000). Captive breeding and translocation 
        therefore should not be perceived as panaceas for the loss of biological 
        diversity that might accompany dramatic climate change, especially given 
        the current state of the environment. Populations of many species already 
        are perilously small; further loss of habitat and stress associated with 
        severe climate change may push many taxa to extinction. </p>
      <p>One limitation to captive breeding is the lack of space available to 
        hold wildlife for breeding purposes. Zoos and offsite breeding facilities 
        can be expected to accommodate no more than a small fraction of the number 
        of species that might be threatened. Recent studies have indicated that 
        no more than 16 snake species and 141 bird species could be accommodated 
        and sustained in accredited North American zoos and aquariums in long-term 
        management programs (Quinn and Quinn, 1993; Sheppard, 1995). </p>
      <p>Captive breeding programs are expensive, and locating funding to support 
        large numbers of programs could be difficult (Hutchins et al., 1996). 
        For example, it costs US$22,000 to raise a single golden lion tamarin 
        in the United States and reintroduce it to its native Brazil (Kleiman 
        et al., 1991). Part of the cost associated with such programs includes 
        the extensive scientific studies that must be conducted for the program 
        to be successful. Reintroduction is technologically difficult and unlikely 
        to be successful in the absence of knowledge about the species' basic 
        biology and behavior (Hutchins et al., 1996). Rearing and release strategies 
        must be tested experimentally, and released animals must be monitored 
        to assess the efficacy of various methods (Beck et al., 1994). In the 
        case of black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) and golden lion tamarins, 
        it took more than a decade to develop the knowledge base required for 
        success.</p>
      <p>If wildlife translocation involves moving species outside their natural 
        ranges, other problems may ensue. Exotic species can have devastating 
        effects on host ecosystems, including extinction of native fauna (McKnight, 
        1993). The unpredictable consequences of species introductions means that 
        translocation is severely limited in its ability to conserve species that 
        are threatened by climate change. </p>
      <p>Finally, reintroduction and translocation programs cannot be successful 
        if there is no appropriate habitat left for captive-bred or translocated 
        animals to be released into (Hutchins et al., 1996). Not all of the habitat 
        components that are necessary for a species to survive can be translocated. 
        Entire suites of plant and invertebrate species may be critical elements 
        for a species to succeed in a new environment, but no techniques exist 
        for translocating intact biological communities. Although captive breeding 
        and translocation have potential value for well-studied animals, these 
        strategies appear to be impractical for the vast number of species threatened 
        by rapid climate change. </p>

<h4><a name="5443"></a>5.4.4.3. Replacing Lost Ecosystem Services</h4>
<p>Humans may need to adapt not only in terms of wildlife conservation but also 
  to replace lost ecological services normally provided by wildlife. It may be 
  necessary to develop adaptations to losses of natural pest control, pollination, 
  and seed dispersal. Although replacing providers of these three services sometimes 
  may be possible, the alternatives may be costly (Buchmann and Nabhan, 1996). 
  Finding a replacement for other services, such as contributions to nutrient 
  cycling and ecosystem stability/biodiversity, are much harder to imagine. In 
  many cases, such as the values of wildlife associated with subsistence hunting 
  and cultural and religious ceremonies, any attempt at replacement may represent 
  a net loss. </p>
<p>In many agricultural/silvicultural systems, pesticides are used to prevent 
  losses to pests (insects, pathogens, some vertebrates). In the past 50 years, 
  pesticide use worldwide has increased more than 25-fold (Worldwatch Institute, 
  1999). The estimated cost of pesticide use in the United States in the mid-1990s 
  was US$11.9 billion (equivalent to 4.5% of total U.S. farm production expenditures), 
  and worldwide use was US$30.6 billion (Aspelin and Grube, 1999). Given that 
  these values are for systems that still had some natural pest control, changes 
  in wildlife distributions might necessitate changes in economic expenditures 
  for pesticides. </p>
<p>However, pesticides often kill more than the target species, possibly eliminating 
  natural predators that keep pest populations low. For example, increased pesticide 
  use in Indonesia between 1980 and 1985 led to the destruction of the natural 
  enemies of the brown planthopper. Subsequent increases in planthopper numbers 
  caused reductions in rice yields estimated to cost US$1.5 billion (FAO figures 
  cited in Pimentel et al., 1992). </p>
<p>Adaptation to loss of natural pollinators may be possible in some cases. Farmers 
  sometimes lease bee colonies to pollinate their crops. Although this may be 
  an option for the ~15% of crops fertilized by domestic honeybees, it may not 
  be an option for crops typically fertilized by wild pollinators or for the 250,000 
  types of wild plants that are pollinated by 100,000 different invertebrate species 
  (Buchmann and Nabhan, 1996).</p>
