<h3>10.2.5. Settlements and Infrastructure</h3>
<h4>10.2.5.1. Overview of Issues<a name="10251"></a></h4>
<p>The main challenges that are likely to face African populations will emanate 
  from the effects of extreme events such as tropical storms, floods, landslides, 
  wind, cold waves, droughts, and abnormal sea-level rises that are expected as 
  a result of climate change. These events are likely to exacerbate management 
  problems relating to pollution, sanitation, waste disposal, water supply, public 
  health, infrastructure, and technologies of production (IPCC, 1996).</p>
<p>The pattern of distribution of human settlements often reflects the uneven 
  nature of resource endowments and availability between regions and within individual 
  communities. In Africa, as elsewhere, there are heavy concentrations of human 
  settlements within 100 km of coastal zones (Singh <i>et al.,</i> 1999), in areas 
  of high economic potential, in river and lake basins, in close proximity to 
  major transportation routes, and in places that enjoy hospitable climatic regimes. 
  Changes in climate conditions would have severe impacts not only on the pattern 
  of distribution of human settlements but also on the quality of life in particular 
  areas.<br>
  The transport sector is based on long-term, immovable infrastructure such as 
  roads, rails, and water. Road networks have tended to link industrial centers 
  with major areas of agricultural activity; railways have been designed primarily 
  with a sea-route orientation to facilitate international shipments of primary 
  products. Climate change may lead to industrial relocation, resulting either 
  from sea-level rise in coastal-zone areas or from transitions in agroecological 
  zones. If sea-level rise occurs, the effect on the many harbors and ports around 
  the continent will be quite devastating economically for many coastal-zone countries. 
  Excessive precipitation, which may occur in some parts of Africa, is likely 
  to have serious negative effects on road networks and air transport.</p>
<h4>10.2.5.2. Coastal Settlements and Sea-Level Rise<a name="10252"></a></h4>
<p>More than one-quarter of the population of Africa resides within 100 km of 
  a sea coast (Singh <i>et al.,</i> 1999), rendering a significant number of people 
  vulnerable to rises in sea level as a result of climate change. Modeling the 
  effects of a 38-cm mean global sea-level rise in 2080, Nicholls <i>et al.</i> 
  (1999) estimate that the average annual number of people in Africa impacted 
  by flooding could increase from 1 million in 1990 to a worst case of 70 million 
  in 2080. Jallow <i>et al.</i> (1999) estimate that the capital of The Gambia, 
  Banjul, could disappear in 50-60 years through coastal erosion and sea-level 
  rise, putting more than 42,000 people at risk. El Raey <i>et al. </i>(1999) 
  discuss threats to coastal areas of Egypt from sea-level changes. East Africa 
  coastal settlements also are at risk from sea-level rise (Magadza, 2000).</p>
<p>There are three response strategies to rising sea level and its physical impacts: 
  retreat, adapt, or defend. Retreat can involve chaotic abandonment of property 
  and cultural investments, or it can be an ordered, planned program that minimizes 
  losses from rising sea level and maximizes the cost-effectiveness of the operation. 
  The operation also seeks to leave surrendered areas as aesthetic looking as 
  possible and to avoid abandoned structures that are an operational hazard to 
  other social and economic activities.</p>
<p>The capacity of individual states to undertake coastal defense work may be 
  limited. However, if such works are planned on a long-term time scale, it is 
  possible to develop such defenses well before the crisis occurs and thus to 
  spread the total capital costs over many years. </p>
<p>Because the problem of coastal management is regional, such a process would 
  require:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional integration among coastal-zone states<br>
  </li>
  <li>Recognition by all governments in the region of regional vulnerability to 
    climate change impacts<br>
  </li>
  <li>Political and institutional stability that allows intergenerational projects 
    to be sustained without interruption from political upheavals.</li>
</ul>
