<h4>5.3.3.4. Response of Plant Crops and Possible Adaptation Options</h4>
<p>Very little work has investigated prospects for natural adaptation of crop 
  species to climate change, and the results of the few studies that do have been 
  inconclusive. However, there appears to be a wide range of resistance to high-temperature 
  stress within and among crop species. For example, moderately large genetic 
  variation in the tolerance to high-temperature induced spikelet sterility has 
  been reported among and between indica- and japonica-type rice genotypes (Matsui 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). Some rice cultivars have the ability to flower early in the morning, 
  thereby potentially avoiding the damaging effects of higher temperatures later 
  in the day (Imaki <i>et al</i>., 1987). <br>
</p>
<p>Prospects for managed genetic modification appear to be more optimistic than 
  for natural adaptation. Intraspecific variation in seed yield of soybean in 
  response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was observed by Ziska <i>et al</i>. (1998). Differences 
  in carbon partitioning among soybean cultivars may influence reproductive capacity 
  and fecundity as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases, with subsequent consequences 
  for future agricultural breeding strategies (Ziska <i>et al</i>., 1998). However, no 
  significant intraspecific variability in responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  was detected in studies with wheat and temperate forage species (L&uuml;scher 
  and N&ouml;sberger, 1997; Batts <i>et al</i>., 1998). To promote adaptation to an environment 
  of high CO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature, plant breeders have suggested selection 
  of cultivars that exhibit heat tolerance during reproductive development, high 
  harvest index, small leaves, and low leaf area per unit ground (to reduce heat 
  load) (Hall and Allen, 1993). However, prospects to improve adaptation of crop 
  species to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> remain very uncertain, and more research 
  in this direction is required.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="534"></a>5.3.4. Impacts and Adaptation at Farm to Subnational Regional 
  Scales </h3>
<h4><a name="5341"></a>5.3.4.1. Modeling Crop Yield Impact</h4>
<p>The number of studies that model the yield impacts of climate change (with 
  and without CO<sub>2</sub> direct effects and with and without adaptation) across 
  individual sites in regions has continued to grow since the SAR. Of particular 
  note is the expansion of studies that explicitly model the effects of change 
  in climate variability and means simultaneously versus change in climate means 
  only (Southworth <i>et al</i>., 1999), use transient climate change scenarios, 
  and report modeling of agronomic and socioeconomic adaptation. A selection of 
  major global and regional model-based studies reported since the SAR is summarized 
  in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a>.<br>
</p>
<p><a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a> yields are reported as ranges of percentage 
  change over the climate change scenarios, modeling sites, and crop as noted. 
  Thirteen of the yield ranges&#151;without adaptation&#151;are from studies of 
  tropical crops. Of the 13 ranges, 10 encompass changes that are exclusively 
  lower than current yields. In three ranges, a portion of the range is approximately 
  no different from current yields or slightly above. In the tropics, most crops 
  are at or near theoretical temperature optimums, and any additional warming 
  is deleterious to yields. Thirty ranges of percentage changes in temperate crop 
  yields also appear in <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a>. Of these 30 ranges, 
  six encompass changes that are exclusively higher than current yields. In another 
  seven, half or more of the changes were more than current yields. In yet another 
  seven, less than half of the changes extended above current yields. The remaining 
  10 ranges encompassed changes that were exclusively less than current yields. 
  Hence, in two-thirds of the cases, temperate crop yields benefited at least 
  some of the time from climate change.</p>
<p>New work on climate change scenarios (Mitchell <i>et al</i>., 2000) generated with 
  stabilized radiative forcing at 550 and 750 ppm equivalent-CO<sub>2</sub> and 
  unstabilized radiative forcing (i.e., unmitigated emissions) in the HadCM2 model 
  simulated major cereal yield response globally in 2080 (Arnell <i>et al</i>., 2001). 
  The pattern of yield changes with unstabilized forcing duplicates the pattern 
  described above: Generally positive changes at mid- and high latitudes overshadowed 
  by reductions in yields at low latitudes. Stablization at 550 ppm ameliorates 
  yield reductions everywhere, although substantial reductions persist in many 
  low-latitude countries. Stabilization at 750 ppm produces a pattern of yield 
  response that is intermediate relative to the 550 ppm and unstabilized forcing 
  scenarios, with anomalous yield increases in mid-latitudes relative to 550 ppm 
  as a result of interactions between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, 
  and moisture. More studies are needed before confidence levels can be assigned 
  to understanding of the agricultural consequences of stabilization, although 
  this work is an important step.</p>
<p>In all agricultural regions, the effects of natural climate variability are 
  likely to interact with human-induced climate change to determine the magnitude 
  of impacts on agricultural production. Some analyses postulate an increase in 
  weather variability (Mearns <i>et al</i>., 1992, 1995; Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 
  2000); simulations of wheat growth indicate that greater interannual variation 
  of temperature reduces average grain yield (Semenov and Porter, 1995). Hulme 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) simulated natural climate variability in a multi-century 
  control climate for comparison with changed variability in a set of transient 
  climate change simulations. Wheat yields were simulated with control and climate 
  change scenarios. For some regions, the impacts of climate change on wheat yields 
  were undetectable relative to the yield impacts of the natural variability of 
  the control climate (see <a href="212.htm#tab54">Table 5-4</a>). Greater efforts 
  to take account of the "noise" of natural climate variability are indicated 
  (Semenov <i>et al</i>., 1996).<br>
  <br>
  The importance of diurnal climate variability has emerged since the SAR (Reilly 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996). Cold temperatures presently limit the yield of rice in all temperate 
  rice-growing regions. Jacobs and Pearson (1999) provide new field results on 
  irreversible effects and retardation (but recoverable) impacts of cold temperatures 
  on various physiological processes in rice. On the other hand, rice spikelet 
  sterility above 35&deg;C at flowering (usually during daytime) puts rice at 
  risk from increased daily maximum temperatures (Horie <i>et al</i>., 1996). In light 
  of recent observed rises in temperatures that are larger for daily minima than 
  daily maxima (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 1997), Dhakhwa <i>et al</i>. (1997) and Dhakhwa and 
  Campbell (1998) conclude that, compared to equal day-night warming, differential 
  warming leads to less water loss through evapotranspiration and better WUE. 
  This is likely to lead to enhanced photosynthesis, crop growth, and yield&#151;although 
  at a possible loss of nutritional quality (Murray, 1997). Possible reduction 
  of frost incidence is not normally considered in these studies. On the negative 
  side, higher nighttime temperatures could extend the overwintering range for 
  some insect pests and broaden the range of other temperature-sensitive pathogens.<br>
</p>
<p>Substantial progress has been made in development of transient (time-evolving) 
  scenarios of climate change for use in agricultural impact assessment. An important 
  question arises regarding whether 2 years with exactly the same climate, one 
  produced by a transient scenario and the other by an equilibrium scenario, would 
  give different production system responses. Many crop models contain cumulative 
  functions that retain environmental information over several years (e.g., water 
  balance, soil nutrients). This factor alone could account for substantial yield 
  response differences between transient and equilibrium climate change scenarios. 
  Only a few studies deliberately have compared simulated yields with transient 
  and equilibrium climate change scenarios. Using the UKHIV equilibrium scenario 
  with increased interannual variability at Rothamsted, Semenov <i>et al</i>. 
  (1996) simulate a loss of wheat yield relative to current with two crop models 
  and no change with a third. With the UKTR transient scenario, all three models 
  show yield increases relative to current climate. The U.S. Country Studies Program 
  (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1996a) used the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy 
  System (CERES) model to simulate larger average increases in winter wheat across 
  Kazakhstan with the GFDL transient climate change scenario (for the 10th decade) 
  (+21% winter wheat yield) than the GFDL equilibrium scenario (+17% winter wheat 
  yield). Spring wheat yields decreased with both scenarios; again, however, yields 
  simulated with the transient climate change were not as adversely affected as 
  those simulated with the equilibrium climate change. Rosenzweig and Iglesias 
  (1998) also found that wheat, maize, and soybean yields are less adversely affected 
  by transient climate change than equilibrium climate change. Lack of consistency 
  in application of transient climate change scenarios to impact modeling between 
  studies results in competing explanations about differences in impact estimates 
  between the two types of climate change scenarios.</p>
