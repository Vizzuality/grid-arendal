<h4>13.2.3.2. Fisheries </h4>
<p>Detailed analyses of fish physiological response to water temperature have 
  shown that the potential impact of climate change on freshwater and marine fish 
  is large (Wood and McDonald, 1997). Unfortunately, current knowledge appears 
  to be limited mostly to single key species, abstracted from the wider ecosystem 
  context that supports fisheries production. It is likely that extrapolation 
  from biological first principles will provide only limited foresight at a fisheries 
  level in that context. However, it is likely that in the short term, fish will 
  move to new habitats to find conditions to which they have adapted. </p>
<p>Two first-order effects-changes in biodiversity and changes in fisheries and 
  aquaculture productivity-are examined. For each of these, key impacts in the 
  European region are discussed with respect to temperature rise and other factors 
  that are linked to climate change. For marine systems, these key factors are 
  sea-level rise and changes in ice cover, salinity, and ocean currents; for inland 
  waters, factors such as hydrological changes (e.g., dams, water abstraction), 
  hydrochemical changes (including anoxia, water acidity, pollution and toxicity 
  events), and eutrophication are key. </p>
<h4><a name="132321"></a>13.2.3.2.1. Freshwater and marine biodiversity </h4>
<p>It has been possible, for the better-known species, to obtain a rough first 
  picture of likely faunal movements and range shifts that would result from the 
  temperature rise currently forecast for the European region. </p>
<p>This has been done, for example, for wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which 
  sustains important recreational and commercial fisheries over most of northern 
  Europe and has a high conservation indicator value over its entire range. Atlantic 
  salmon spends its early and juvenile life in freshwater slowly moving away from 
  the headwater spawning grounds in rivers out to sea, to grow and mature. Looking 
  at the direct and indirect influence of temperature on protein synthesis on 
  all life-cycle stages, McCarthy and Houlihan (1997) suggest that there will 
  be a northward shift in the geographic distribution of Atlantic salmon in Europe, 
  with likely local extinction at the southern edge of the current range and new 
  habitats colonized in the north. The influence of temperature on overwintering 
  survival of 1- and 2-year-old salmon and the distribution of post-smolts in 
  the North Sea area already is apparent (Friedland et al., 1998). </p>
<p>High sensitivity to water temperature of fish larval and juvenile stages, combined 
  with the higher susceptibility of headwaters and smaller rivers to air temperature 
  rise, implies important effects of climate change on cold and temperate anadromous 
  species such as the sea trout, alewife (Alosa alosa Atlantic and Mediterranean), 
  and sturgeon (Atlantic, Black Sea, Caspian Sea). Similar impacts are likely 
  for all salmonid species in Europe, including those that do not migrate to sea. 
  Fish species are likely to extend their range northward (e.g., Brander, 1997). 
  To identify impacts on recreational fisheries and conservation efforts that 
  can be attributed to climate change, changes in local species presence will 
  need to be assessed at a pan-European level, beyond watershed and national levels. 
</p>
<p>Global environmental change and introduction of species make it difficult to 
  identify impacts of climate change in freshwater systems. Direct evidence of 
  species shift and long-range movement often is physically limited between watersheds; 
  introductions of alien species and genotypes-either voluntary or accidentally-have 
  been very extensive. The influence of global warming on marine fish species 
  and migratory species that reproduce and spend their early life history in marine 
  waters (catadromous fish-e.g., eel) is more complex to foresee because of the 
  various spatial and long temporal scales involved, as well as the feedback loop 
  between air and ocean temperatures. </p>
<p>Some insight may be gained by reviewing historical shifts in the geographical 
  distribution of European fish species to gain a better estimation of how fast 
  and how far species may change their distributions. For example, the period 
  of warming between 1920 and 1940 resulted in widespread changes in the distribution 
  of terrestrial and marine species from Greenland to the Barents Sea. </p>
<h4><a name="132322"></a>13.2.3.2.2. Fisheries and aquaculture productivity </h4>
<p>Future impacts on aquatic systems productivity from climate change are mostly 
  uncertain because of other, related or independent, pressures. Resource overexploitation 
  appears to be the single most important factor directly threatening the sustainability 
  of many commercial fisheries in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 
  (OECD) countries (OECD, 1997). Overexploitation increases the vulnerability 
  of fisheries to climate variability because so few fish are left in the stock 
  to grow and multiply in a year of poor recruitment. The North Sea cod fishing 
  industry, for example, now relies on only 1- or 2-year classes (Cook et al.,1997) 
  and therefore is vulnerable to a year or two of poor recruitment caused by adverse 
  climatic conditions. </p>
<p>Productivity of some fish stocks may benefit from warming trends. For example, 
  recruitment of cod in the Barents Sea is higher in warm years. This probably 
  comes about as a result of indirect effects (on capelin and zooplankton) as 
  much as through direct effects. </p>
<p>Cod in the North Sea are at the warm end of their thermal range, and their 
  recruitment therefore seems to benefit during cold periods, such as the 1960s 
  and 1970s (Dippner, 1997; Brander, 2000). The temperature and wind regime of 
  the North Sea are strongly influenced by the NAO, records of which go back more 
  than a century. Some of the variability in catches of North Sea cod may be explained 
  by trends in the NAO, but changes in exploitation are a major factor. </p>
<p>Other factors are likely to combine with changes in temperature and decrease 
  fish and shellfish productivity. Chronic levels of pollution are known to reduce 
  marine and freshwater fish fecundity (Kime, 1995), decrease freshwater supply 
  (which exacerbates low dissolved-oxygen concentrations), increase solid transport 
  from erosion, and increase habitat fragmentation in inland waters. Development 
  of marine aquaculture may be slowed by a decreasing availability of sites with 
  cool enough surface water temperature and by increased susceptibility to disease. 
</p>
<p>The consequences of fisheries collapse are complex. For example, the North 
  Sea herring fishery collapsed in 1977 and was closed for 5 years. Although the 
  rapid recovery of the resource surprised fisheries biologists, the most dramatic 
  effect on the industry resulted from a permanent change of consumer preferences 
  (Bailey and Steele, 1992) away from kippers and fresh and pickled herring. The 
  fishery recovered, but the market did not. </p>
<p>Finally, the dramatic effect of climate change on fisheries production is well 
  documented (Durand, 1998) for the world's four main upwelling systems: the California 
  current, the Peru current, the Canary current (off northwest Africa and southern 
  Spain and Portugal), and the Benguela current (off the Atlantic coast of southern 
  Africa). Although these currents are mostly outside European waters, the effects 
  on Europe's distant water fishing fleet, fishing sector investments, and import 
  prices for human consumption and aquaculture feed cannot be ignored. </p>
