<h4><a name="15213"></a>15.2.1.3. Flood Risks</h4>
<p>Flooding poses risks to human life and property. Vulnerability to flood damages 
  is highly location-specific, and there is considerable variability across watersheds 
  in the value of developed property and population located within 500-year floodplains 
  as defined by current understanding of current climate (Hurd <i>et al</i>., 
  1999). Flood events also can have significant impacts on ecosystems. For example, 
  heavy precipitation events may leach nitrogen and other nonpoint-source pollutants 
  from agricultural lands, and the resulting nutrient pulse may severely stress 
  coastal and estuarine ecosystems (Justic <i>et al</i>., 1996; Rabalais <i>et 
  al</i>., 1996). In addition, the influx of freshwater during floods may affect 
  estuary-dependent species. For example, oyster populations suffer severe declines 
  when floods reduce the salinity of Galveston Bay (Hofmann and Powell, 1998).</p>
<p>Coupling of natural disasters, such as extreme storm events, with large-scale 
  human disturbance of the landscape can cause extreme disturbance to freshwater 
  and marine resources that would not be predicted by considering these effects 
  independently. The consequences of Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in eastern North 
  Carolina in September 1999 provide a recent example of the importance of this 
  coupling (see <a href="586.htm">Section 15.3.2.7</a>). Rainfall of almost 1 
  m generated highly polluted, organic-rich floodwaters as containment ponds for 
  poultry and hog waste were breached and raw sewage, fertilizers, decaying vegetation, 
  and other organic sources were entrained by the flood. One serious effect was 
  contamination of shallow groundwater sources with fecal coliforms and organic 
  pollutants, which may jeopardize local water supplies long after the floodwaters 
  subsided. Of even greater economic impact for this region, the surge of floodwater 
  caused the waters of the biologically rich estuary between the Carolina mainland 
  and the Outer Banks to be the color of weak coffee and deposited large amounts 
  of organic material in coastal sediments, especially in the estuaries and westernmost 
  Pamlico Sound. The Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System provides fully half of 
  the area used as nursery grounds for commercially important fish from Maine 
  to Florida. These waters are a vitally important feeding area for small sport 
  fish and menhaden and an important nursery for flounder, weakfish, shrimp, and 
  crabs. At the time, there was considerable concern that the release of nutrients 
  and consumption of oxygen as deposited organic material decomposed would cause 
  physical stresses, disrupting the coastal food web and commercial fisheries 
  for a significant period (Paerl <i>et al</i>., 2000). As it turned out, the 
  mesohaline estuaries west of the Pamlico Sound sustained the greatest damage 
  from pollution that was washed in and deposited to the bottom muds (Burkholder 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Pamlico Sound was protected from high impacts because 
  much of the pollution settled out in the estuaries and because of its high flushing 
  exchange with the ocean relative to the estuaries. The high dilution provided 
  by the extreme runoff associated with Hurricane Floyd was a "saving grace" that 
  appeared to buffer the pollution effects, so no fish kills were reported throughout 
  the system (Burkholder <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, concerns remain about 
  chronic, more long-term impacts from the pollution that remained behind in the 
  estuaries.</p>
<p>Possible changes in runoff patterns, coupled with apparent recent trends in 
  societal vulnerability to floods in parts of North America, suggest that flood 
  risks may increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change (see <a href="574.htm">Section 
  15.2.5</a>). Changes in snowpack accumulation and the timing of melt-off are 
  likely to affect the seasonal distribution and characteristics of flood events 
  in some areas. For example, in mountainous western watersheds, winter and early 
  spring flood events may become more frequent (Melack <i>et al</i>., 1997; Lettenmaier 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). In southeastern Canadian and northeastern U.S. watersheds, 
  reductions in winter snowpacks and river ice will tend to reduce winter and 
  spring flood risks (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 2000), where at present "rain-on-snow 
  and snowmelt floods can be the largest and most destructive stormflow events 
  in the region" (Platt <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, Canadian rivers in northern 
  areas may begin to experience winter ice break-ups and associated flooding (Bruce 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>In inflation-adjusted terms, average annual flood damage has increased in the 
  United States over the past few decades. This increasing trend in damages appears 
  to be related to increases in population and the value of developed property 
  in floodplains, as well as changes in precipitation characteristics, with perhaps 
  as much as 80% of the trend attributable to population and wealth changes (Pielke 
  and Downton, 2000). Measured as a proportion of real tangible wealth, average 
  annual flood damages have been roughly constant over time (Pielke and Downton, 
  2000). This ongoing vulnerability comes despite the fact that various federal, 
  state, and local governments and private entities have built approximately 40,000 
  km of levees along the rivers and streams of the United States&#151;a combined 
  total distance that is long enough to encircle the Earth at the equator (Pielke, 
  1999). </p>
<p>Recent severe flood events&#151;particularly the 1993 Mississippi River floods, 
  the 1996 Saguenay flood, the 1997 Red River flood, and winter flooding in California 
  in 1997&#151;have led to reexaminations of traditional approaches to flood management. 
  For example, a U.S. federal interagency task force was formed in the wake of 
  the 1993 floods, and its recommendations have contributed to altered federal 
  practices (IFMRC, 1994). In an assessment of the 1993 floods, which caused on 
  the order of US$18 billion in damages, Changnon (1996) notes that the extreme 
  and prolonged flooding had significant and unexpected impacts that defied previous 
  experience and design extremes. Changnon further concludes that many systems 
  for monitoring and predicting flood conditions were inadequate; that incomplete 
  or incorrect information was released during the flood; and that many previous 
  approaches to mitigate flood losses failed. He also identifies benefits, including 
  benefits to the natural ecosystem of the Mississippi floodplain.<br>
</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that the efforts of one community to protect itself 
  from floods (for example, through levee construction) may affect the likelihood 
  of flood damages in other communities (Mount, 1995). Therefore, coordinated 
  regional planning and management may allow more efficient adaptation to changing 
  flood risks than uncoordinated efforts by individual communities. However, there 
  are many things that individual communities can do to rationally adapt to flood 
  risks and reduce the likelihood of serious damages (City of Tulsa, 1994). Many 
  entities that are responsible for floodplain management are rethinking the design 
  of levee systems and other flood management policies (City of Tulsa, 1994; IFMRC, 
  1994; Mount, 1995; Tobin, 1995; Pielke, 1996; Wright, 1996). These developments 
  may improve resilience to future flooding events, but it is not yet clear if 
  recent policy discussions will lead to substantial and effective changes in 
  floodplain management or flood response practices.</p>
