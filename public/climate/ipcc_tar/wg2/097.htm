<h3>2.5.3. Nonmarket Impacts</h3>
<p>Many impacts involve changes in the direct and/or indirect flows of valued 
  services to society. These services can offer a wide range of valuable attributes, 
  but they frequently go unpriced in the economic sense. Markets simply do not 
  exist for some attributes and some services; contemplating markets for some 
  others (e.g., health services) has been questioned even given extensive competiton 
  for services and products. For others, markets that do exist fall short of being 
  comprehensive or complete in the presence of externalities of production or 
  consumption. In either case (and others), researchers have recognized the need 
  to develop alternative means with which to assess value. More precisely, they 
  have tried to extend the scope of the economic paradigm so that implicit and 
  explicit tradeoffs between development and conservation of unpriced resources 
  can be explored within the structures of standard decision analytic tools such 
  as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and so on. Parikh and 
  Parikh (1997, 1998) provide a primer on valuation with case studies.</p>
<p>To be more specific, economists have built a theory of choice on the basis 
  of the notions of consumer sovereignty and rationality. Economists assume, therefore, 
  that individuals are able to value changes in nonmarket goods and services as 
  easily as they can value changes in marketed goods and services. The only difference 
  between the two cases is that markets provide the researcher with some indirect 
  data with which to assess individuals' values of marketed products. Nevertheless, 
  individuals should be able to tell researchers what they would be willing to 
  pay for changes in nonmarket conditions or willing to accept as compensation 
  for those changes. In fact, willingness to accept (WTA) payment for foregoing 
  a good and willingness to pay (WTP) for a good are the two general yardsticks 
  against which values are judged. </p>
<p>It should be noted that WTA and WTP are seldom the same for most nonmarket 
  goods or services. In fact, WTA and WTP can give wildly different estimates 
  of the value of these services if there are no perfect substitutes (i.e., if 
  it is impossible to fully compensate individuals unit by unit for their loss). 
  When such a substitute does not exist, WTA &gt; WTP. By how much? Cummings et 
  al. (1986) report that it is not uncommon for estimated WTA to be more than 
  10 times larger than estimated WTP. These differences might be derivative of 
  the method of estimation, but they also reflect the fact that WTA and WTP are 
  two different concepts that need not match.</p>
<p>It also should be noted that WTA and WTP have analogs in the market context. 
  Compensated variation (CV) is the extra income that individuals would require 
  to accept an increase in the price of some marketed good; CV is the analog of 
  WTA. Equivalent variation (EV) is the income that individuals would be willing 
  to forego to see the price of some marketed good fall; EV is the analog of WTP. 
  These measures sometimes are used in market-based analysis. It should be no 
  surprise that EV &lt; CV unless the good in question has a perfect substitute.</p>
<h4><a name="2531"></a>2.5.3.1. Direct Methods of Valuation</h4>
<p>Valuation methods usually are divided into two distinct approaches. Direct 
  methods try to judge individuals' value for nonmarketed goods by asking 
  them directly. Contingent valuation methods (CVMs), for example, ask people 
  for their maximum WTP to effect a positive change in their environments or their 
  minimum WTA to endure a negative change. Davis (1963) authored the first paper 
  to report CVM results for environmental goods. Comprehensive accounts of these 
  methods appear in Mitchell and Carson (1989), Hanley and Spash (1993), and Bateman 
  and Willis (1995). This is a controversial method, and current environmental 
  and resource literature continues to contain paper after paper confronting or 
  uncovering problems of consistency, bias, truth-revelation, embedding, and the 
  like. Hanley <i>et al</i>. (1997) offer a quick overview of these discussions 
  and a thorough bibliography.</p>
<h4><a name="2532"></a>2.5.3.2. Indirect Methods of Valuation</h4>
<p>Indirect methods of valuation try to judge individuals' value for nonmarketed 
  goods by observing their behavior in related markets. Hedonic pricing methods, 
  for example, assume that a person buys goods for their various attributes. Thus, 
  for example, a house has attributes such as floor area; number of bathrooms; 
  the view it provides; access to schools, hospitals, entertainment, and jobs; 
  and air quality . By estimating the demand for houses with different sets of 
  attributes, we can estimate how much people value air quality. One can thus 
  estimate "pseudo-demand curves" for nonmarketed goods such as air 
  quality. Travel costs are another area in which valuation estimates of the multiple 
  criteria on which utility depends can be finessed out of observable behavior. 
  The hedonic method was first proposed by Lancaster (1966) and Rosen (1974). 
  Tiwari and Parikh (1997) have estimated such a hedonic demand function for housing 
  in Bombay. Mendelsohn et al. (2000) brought the hedonic approach to the fore 
  in the global change impacts arena. Braden and Kolstad (1991) and Hanley and 
  Spash (1993) offer thorough reviews of both approaches. Is there a scientific 
  consensus on the state of the science for these methods? Not really. There is, 
  instead, a growing literature that warns of caveats in their application and 
  interpretation (e.g., health services) and/or improves their ability to cope 
  with these caveats. Smith (2000) provides a careful overview of this literature 
  and an assessment of progress over the past 25 years.</p>
