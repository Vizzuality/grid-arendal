<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>The types of weather-related losses vary considerably between the United States 
  and Canada. As shown in <a href="576.htm#fig154">Figure 15-4</a>, storm-related 
  losses, including hurricanes, represent a larger share of losses in the United 
  States, whereas flood and other weather-related events represent a far higher 
  share in Canada. Large hurricane losses are substantial in the United States 
  but have been virtually absent in Canada since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Flood 
  and storm events (other than hurricanes) have accounted for 95% of Canada's 
  recent weather-related losses. <br>
</p>
<p>North American insurers have demonstrated sensitivity to the extremes and uncertainties 
  of weather-related events. The trend in recent decades is toward increasing 
  adverse impacts such as rising losses, upward pressure on prices, availability 
  problems, company insolvencies, depressed stock prices, and increased reliance 
  on government-provided insurance and disaster preparedness/recovery resources 
  (see <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). P/C industries in the United States (see 
  <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>) and Canada (Emergency Preparedness Canada, 
  2000) have observed reduced and even negative operating results in years with 
  large natural disaster losses.<br>
</p>
<p>A U.S.-based insurance trade association estimates that in 1997, 17% of U.S. 
  insurance P/C premiums were associated with "significant" exposure 
  to weather-related loss, 2% with "moderate" exposure, 66% with "minor" 
  exposure, 10% with "minor to no" exposure, and 4% with "no" 
  exposure (American Insurance Association, 1999). In these estimates, "exposure" 
  is measured in terms of insurer premiums as opposed to the value of exposed 
  property. Most flood and crop risks are not included because government insurance 
  programs assume them. The "minor exposure" segment is mostly vehicle 
  insurance. However, in the United States, 16% of automobile accidents are attributed 
  to adverse weather conditions (NHTSA, 1998), as are one-third of the accidents 
  in Canada (White and Etkin, 1997). Vehicles also sustain privately insured losses 
  from floods and hailstorms.<br>
</p>
<p>In practice, insurer surplus is not poolable. Even at an industry-wide level, 
  insurance pricing can be inadequate to cover future losses. This was evident 
  in the case of the Northridge earthquake in California, where the US$3.4 billion 
  in earthquake premiums collected during 25 years prior to the event fell far 
  short of the US$15.3 billion loss (Gastel, 1999). Individual firms can come 
  under stress long before the industry does as a whole. U.S. P/C insurers experienced 
  approximately 650 insolvencies (bankruptcies) between 1969 and 1998, 8% of which 
  were caused primarily by natural disasters (Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1999). These 
  disaster-related insolvencies include small as well as very large firms (see 
  <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). Meanwhile, no recorded Canadian insurance 
  insolvencies have been attributed to extreme events.<br>
</p>
<p>Insurers' ability to withstand weather-related losses is based on a combination 
  of event magnitude and resources (often referred to as assets or surplus) with 
  which they can pay claims. Probable maximum losses (PMLs) and vulnerability 
  vary by locality and have been on the rise (Davidson, 1996; Cummins, 1999; GAO, 
  2000). As illustrated for the United States, natural disasters that are limited 
  to the boundaries of a given state have widely varying potential impacts on 
  insurers, depending on the capacity for paying losses (see <a href="577.htm#fig157">Figure 
  15-7</a>). Insurers have not performed quantitative analyses of the potential 
  effects of climate change on PMLs.<br>
</p>
<p>Surplus&#151;a measure of adaptive capacity&#151;tends to be unstable over 
  time, sometimes changing abruptly in response to perturbations in stock and 
  bond market valuations or interest rates (Mooney, 1999; GAO, 2000; Swiss Re, 
  2000). Although U.S. insurer capacity increased considerably through the 1990s, 
  as illustrated in <a href="578.htm#fig158">Figure 15-8</a>, large events still 
  can result in a substantial volume of unpaid claims. Adaptive capacity can be 
  depleted by multiple sequential events (AIRAC, 1986), as well as by past nonweather-related 
  losses [e.g., from environmental liability (Superfund)]. There also are potential 
  losses stemming from issues such as tobacco liability or the combination of 
  increasing reliance on information technology and emerging questions regarding 
  the reliability of the electricity grid. The finding that U.S. electric cooling 
  demand would increase under global warming (Morrison and Mendelsohn, 1999) would 
  be a compounding factor in the latter example, and adaptation (e.g., increased 
  use of air conditioning) would result in increased GHG emissions. The trend 
  toward increased competition is an additional stress on insurers, although consolidation 
  also can&#151;under the proper circumstances&#151;increase resilience of firms.<br>
</p>
<p>An insurer's vulnerability often extends beyond the borders of the country 
  in which it resides. For example, U.S. insurers collected US$35 billion in premiums 
  for overseas insurance sales in 1997, and such insurance has been growing faster 
  than overall premiums in recent years (III, 1999). Canadian insurers also write 
  policies outside the country, including vulnerable parts of the United States 
  (White and Etkin, 1997). Reinsurers (many which are based in North America) 
  have a high degree of vulnerability given the geographical diversity of their 
  risk portfolios.</p>
