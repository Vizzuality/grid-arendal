<h4>9.7.1.1 Modeling the Impact of Climate Change on Malaria </h4>
<p>Classical epidemiological models of infectious disease use the basic reproduction 
  rate, R0. This measure is defined as the number of new cases of a disease that 
  will arise from one current case when introduced into a nonimmune host population 
  during a single transmission cycle (Anderson and May, 1992). The basic reproduction 
  rate&#151;or a related concept, "vectorial capacity"&#151;can provide 
  a relative index of the impact of different climate scenarios on the transmissibility 
  of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Vectorial capacity, however, is determined 
  by complex interactions of many host, vector, pathogen, and environmental factors. 
  Some of the variables are sensitive to temperature, including mosquito density, 
  feeding frequency, mosquito survival, and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) 
  of the parasite (plasmodium) in the mosquito (Martens <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  The EIP is especially important, and, within the lower temperature range, it 
  is very temperature-sensitive. </p>

<p><a name="fig92"></a>Biological (or process-based) models have been used to 
  estimate the potential transmission of malaria. This is a measure of the extent 
  to which the natural world (the global environment-climate complex) would allow 
  the transmission of malaria if there were no other human-imposed constraints 
  on transmission. However, in some areas where human-imposed constraints have 
  occurred as a result of economic growth, or were put in place purposely, malaria 
  transmission has been successfully controlled, regardless of suitable local 
  temperatures. There has been considerable evolution of models since the SAR 
  (Martens <i>et al</i>., 1995, 1997, 1999; Martin and Lefebvre, 1995). One model 
  (Martens <i>et al</i>., 1999) includes vector-specific information regarding 
  the temperature-transmission relationship and mosquito distribution limits. 
  Recent studies using that revised model applied to the HadCM2 climate scenarios 
  project a global increase of 260-320 million people in 2080 living in the 
  potential transmission zone (against a baseline expectation of about 8 billion&#151;that 
  is, a 2-4% increase in the number of people at risk) (Martens <i>et al</i>., 
  1999; McMichael <i>et al</i>., 2000a). This projection, by design, does not 
  take into account the fact that much of this additional population at risk is 
  in middle- or high-income countries where human-imposed constraints on transmission 
  are greatest and where potential transmission therefore is unlikely to become 
  actual transmission. The model also projects regional increases and a few decreases 
  in the seasonal duration of transmission in current and prospective areas of 
  malaria transmission. Constraining of GHG emissions to achieve CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization 
  within the range 550-750 ppm would reduce those projected increases by 
  about one-third (Arnell <i>et al</i>., 2001). </p>
<p>On a global scale, all biological models show net increases in the potential 
  transmission zone of malaria and changes in seasonal transmission under various 
  climate scenarios (Martens <i>et al</i>., 1995, 1999; Martin and Lefebvre, 1995). 
  Some local decreases in malaria transmission also are predicted to occur where 
  declines in rainfall would limit mosquito survival. The outputs of these malaria 
  models are very sensitive to assumptions about the minimum rainfall or humidity 
  levels needed for malaria transmission.<br>
</p>
<p>Another global modeling study (Rogers and Randolph, 2000) used a statistical-empirical 
  approach, in contrast to the aforementioned biological models. The outcome variable 
  in this model is the number of people living in an actual transmission zone, 
  as opposed to a potential transmission zone (as estimated by biological models). 
  Using an IS92a (unmitigated) climate scenario, this study estimated no significant 
  net change by 2080 in the portion of the world's population living in actual 
  malaria transmission zones; modeled malaria transmission increased in some areas 
  and decreased in others. This study made the assumption that the actual geographic 
  distribution of malaria in today's world is a satisfactory approximation 
  of its historical distribution prior to modern public health interventions. 
  This assumption is likely to have biased the estimation of the underlying multivariate 
  relationship between climatic variables and malaria occurrence because the sensitive 
  climate-malaria relationship in the lower temperature range in temperate zones 
  (especially Europe and the southern United States) would have been excluded 
  from the empirically derived equation. Hence, the use of that derived equation 
  to predict malaria risk in 2080 would have been relatively inert to marginal 
  climatic changes at the fringes of the current geographic distribution. <br>
</p>
<p>Another type of modeling addresses changes in the distribution of mosquito 
  vector species only. The CLIMEX model estimates changes in global and national 
  (Australia) distribution of malaria vectors under a range of climate scenarios, 
  based on the vectors' temperature and moisture requirements (Bryan <i>et 
  al</i>., 1996; Sutherst, 1998). The distribution of Anopheles gambiae complex 
  is projected to undergo a net increase in distribution in southern Africa under 
  three climate change scenarios (Hulme, 1996). However, these models do not address 
  complex ecological interactions, such as competition between species. <br>
</p>
<p>None of these models have been adequately validated at global or regional levels. 
  Modeling to date has not satisfactorily addressed regional vulnerability to 
  malaria or changes in risk in highland regions (Lindsay and Martens, 1998). 
  This is principally because it is difficult to obtain sufficiently detailed 
  geographic distribution maps of mosquitoes and malaria occurrence over time. 
  An important criticism of biological models is that undue emphasis is placed 
  on temperature changes, without consideration to other ecological complexities&#151;including 
  those influenced by rainfall, humidity, and host exposure&#151;that influence 
  transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the equations within a global model may 
  be inappropriate for particular local conditions, and there is a need for cross-validation 
  of large-scale and small-scale studies (Root and Schneider, 1995). Some attempts 
  to apply these integrated modeling techniques to smaller scale regional settings 
  have attempted to take account of local/regional conditions (Lindsay and Martens, 
  1998). None of the modeling to date has incorporated the modulating effect of 
  public health strategies and other social adaptive responses to current or future 
  malaria risk (Sutherst <i>et al</i>., 1998). Nevertheless, it remains a legitimate 
  and important question to estimate, under scenarios of climate change, change 
  in the extent to which the natural world (the global environment-climate complex) 
  would allow transmission of malaria if there were no other human-imposed constraints 
  on transmission. </p>
