<h4>5.2.4.2. Will Organisms have to Migrate?</h4>
<p><a href="205.htm">Section 5.2.2.2</a> raises the question of whether organisms 
  will need to migrate under climate change or whether many species will be able 
  to survive in situ under new climatic conditions (Woodward and Beerling, 1997). 
  Some species do occupy sites that are on the limits of their physiological tolerance, 
  and if climate change takes local climate beyond that threshold, clearly they 
  will not be able to persist at that site (see <a href="242.htm">Section 5.6</a> 
  for examples). However, there is mounting paleoecological evidence of vegetation 
  types persisting through significant climate changes. </p>
<p>Lavoie and Payette (1996) conclude that the stability of the black spruce (Picea 
  mariana [Mill.] BSP.) forest boundary during warm and cold periods of the late 
  Holocene [warm approximately 2,000 years before present (BP), medieval times, 
  and this century; cold approximately 3,000 years BP, 1,300 years BP, and the 
  Little Ice Age] demonstrates that mechanisms that allow forest boundaries to 
  advance or retreat are not easily triggered by climatic change. The black spruce 
  old growth forest persisted for more than 1,500 years through many variations 
  in climate probably because of the buffering effect of the trees on the local 
  environment (Arseneault and Payette, 1997). Only a fire in 1568 AD broke this 
  forest influence on microclimate and local growth conditions and caused the 
  forest vegetation to shift to krummholz. Such studies emphasize the importance 
  of effectively incorporating sufficient biophysical detail to capture climate-ameliorating 
  effects and realistic disturbance regimes.</p>
<h4><a name="5243"></a>5.2.4.3. Human Land-Use Issues </h4>
<p>No projection of the future state of the earth's ecosystems can be made 
  without taking into account past, present, and future human land-use patterns. 
  Human land-use will endanger some ecosystems, enhance the survival of others, 
  and greatly affect the ability of organisms to adapt to climate change via migration. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Leemans (1999) used IMAGE2 to forecast possible global shifts in vegetation 
  types and land-use change. Using a mid-level scenario of human responses to 
  global change, he forecasts that nondomesticated land (his proxy for biodiversity) 
  will decrease from 71 to 62% of the land area between 2000 and 2025, then remain 
  approximately stable until the end of the 21st century. Losses in Africa and 
  parts of Asia from 2000 to 2025 may be as much as 20-30% of remaining nondomesticated 
  land.</p>
<h4><a name="5244"></a>5.2.4.4. Testing Models of Ecosystem Response </h4>
<p>It is clear that ecosystem change models still contain assumptions that are 
  not fully tested, and most models inevitably work better for the geographical 
  regions and time periods for which they were constructed (Hurtt <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  This derives from a mixture of fitting parameters to available data and deliberate 
  and subconscious bias in selecting processes to include in a model. However, 
  testing of ecosystem response models is gradually improving. Bugmann and Solomon 
  (1995) tested the behavior of a model developed for European ecosystems by running 
  it for a comparable North American site. The results were broadly in agreement, 
  with useful indicators about where the model could be improved. <br>
</p>
<p>Another test is to compare different approaches to modeling for a particular 
  purpose, as Yates <i>et al</i>. (2000) did for correlative models such as the 
  Holdridge climatic correlation model and more mechanistic models of vegetation 
  distribution. The strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate areas of application 
  can be determined. Another approach is to conduct sensitivity studies in which 
  the sensitivity of model outputs to changes in the input data and assumptions 
  is evaluated. Hallgren and Pitman (2000) have carried out a sensitivity analysis 
  of BIOME3 (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996); they conclude that parameters that 
  affect photosynthesis, water use, and NPP change the competitive interactions 
  between specific plant groups (e.g., C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> 
  plants). Numerous studies have found that the outputs of ecosystem response 
  models are sensitive to the precise treatment of water availability and water 
  use by vegetation (Gao and Yu, 1998; Churkina <i>et al</i>., 1999; Hallgren 
  and Pitman, 2000; Lassiter <i>et al</i>., 2000). This points to areas in which 
  further development is needed. <br>
</p>
<p>Beerling <i>et al</i>. (1997) used a climate change experiment (CLIMEX) that 
  exposed an entire catchment of boreal vegetation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and temperature for 3 years to test their Sheffield dynamic global vegetation 
  model. There generally was a good match between observations and predictions, 
  but longer runs of such experiments are needed to test such models thoroughly. 
  As paleoecological data sets improve, there is increasing opportunity to test 
  models against these data. However, this is a multiple test because the validity 
  of paleoclimate models themselves also is under test. For example, Kohfeld and 
  Harrison (2000) tested the ability of GCMs to describe changes in data collected 
  for the environments of the last glacial maximum (21,000 years BP) and/or mid-Holocene 
  (6,000 years BP). They conclude that better land-surface (including vegetation) 
  response models are needed to capture the detail observed in the paleoecological 
  data.<br>
</p>
<p>In summary, recent studies show that the potential for significant disruption 
  of ecosystems under climate change remains. Further development of simple correlative 
  models that were available at the time of the SAR points to areas where ecosystem 
  disruption and the potential for ecosystem migration are high. Observational 
  data and newer dynamic vegetation models linked to transient climate models 
  are refining the projections. However, the precise outcomes depend on processes 
  that are too subtle to be fully captured by current models. </p>
