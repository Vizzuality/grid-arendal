<h3>19.4.2. Distribution of Impacts by Sector </h3>
<p>Susceptibility to climate change differs across sectors and regions. A clear 
  example is sea-level rise, which mostly affects coastal zones (see <a href="673.htm#box192">Box 
  19-2</a>). People living in the coastal zone generally will be negatively affected 
  by sea-level rise, but the numbers of people differ by region. For example, 
  Nicholls et al. (1999) found that under a sea-level rise of about 40 cm by the 
  2080s, assuming increased coastal protection, 55 million people would be flooded 
  annually in south Asia; 21 million in southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, 
  and New Guinea; 14 million in Africa; and 3 million in the rest of the world. 
  The relative impacts in small island states also are significant (see <a href="667.htm">Section 
  19.3</a>). In addition, the Atlantic coast of North and Central America, the 
  Mediterranean, and the Baltic are projected to have the greatest loss of wetlands. 
  Inland areas face only secondary effects&#151;which, unlike the negative primary 
  effects, may be either negative or positive (Yohe et al., 1996; Darwin and Tol, 
  2001). </p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 19-3. The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture 
        </b> </div>
      <p>The pressures of climate change on the world's food system are better 
        understood than most other impacts. Research has focused on crop yields; 
        on the basis of those insights, many studies also look at farm productivity, 
        and a smaller number look at national and international agricultural markets. 
      </p>
      <p>Climate change is expected to increase yields at higher latitudes and 
        decrease yields at lower latitudes. Changes in precipitation, however, 
        also can affect yields and alter this general pattern locally and regionally. 
        Studies of the economic impact of this change (in all cases, climate change 
        associated with 2xCO<sub>2</sub>) conclude that the aggregated global 
        impact on the agricultural sector may be slightly negative to moderately 
        positive, depending on underlying assumptions (e.g., Rosenzweig and Parry, 
        1994; Darwin, 1999; Parry et al., 1999; Mendelsohn et al., 2000). Most 
        studies on which these findings are based include the positive effect 
        of carbon fertilization but exclude the negative impact of pests, diseases, 
        and other disturbances related to climate change (e.g., droughts, water 
        availability). The aggregate also hides substantial regional differences. 
        Beneficial effects are expected predominantly in the developed world; 
        strongly negative effects are expected for populations that are poorly 
        connected to regional and global trading systems. Regions that will get 
        drier or already are quite hot for agriculture also will suffer, as will 
        countries that are less well prepared to adapt (e.g., because of lack 
        of infrastructure, capital, or education). Losses may occur even if adaptive 
        capacity is only comparatively weak because trade patterns will shift 
        in favor of those adapting best. Overall, climate change is likely to 
        tip agriculture production in favor of well-to-do and well-fed regions&#151;which 
        either benefit, under moderate warming, or suffer less severe losses&#151;at 
        the expense of less-well-to-do and less well-fed regions. Some studies 
        indicate that the number of hungry and malnourished people in the world 
        may increase, because of climate change, by about 10% relative to the 
        baseline (i.e., an additional 80-90 million people) later in the 
        21st century (e.g., Parry et al., 1999).</p>

<p><a name="box193"></a>Agriculture, to turn to another example, is a major economic 
  sector in some countries and a small one in others. Agriculture is one of the 
  sectors that is most susceptible to climate change, so countries with a large 
  portion of the economy in agriculture face a larger exposure to climate change 
  than countries with a lower share, and these shares vary widely. Whereas countries 
  of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) generate 
  about 2-3% of their GDP from agriculture, African countries generate 5-58% 
  (WRI, 1998).</p>
<p>Activities at the margin of climatic suitability have the most to lose from 
  climate change, if local conditions worsen, and the most to win if conditions 
  improve. One example is subsistence farming under severe water stress&#151;for 
  instance, in semi-arid regions of Africa or south Asia. A decrease of precipitation, 
  an increase in evapotranspiration, or higher interannual variability (particularly 
  longer droughts) could tip the balance from a meager livelihood to no livelihood 
  at all, and the unique cultures often found in marginal areas could be lost. 
  An increase in precipitation, on the other hand, could reduce pressure on marginal 
  areas. Numerous modeling studies of shifts in production of global agriculture&#151;including 
  Kane et al. (1992), Rosenzweig and Parry (1994), Darwin et al. (1995), Leemans 
  (1997), Parry et al. (1999), and Darwin (1999)&#151;have estimated that production 
  in high-latitude countries is likely to increase and production in low-latitude 
  countries is likely to decrease, even though changes in total global output 
  of agriculture could be small. Results in the temperate zone are mixed. Low-latitude 
  countries tend to be least developed and depend heavily on subsistence farming. 
  Under current development trends they will continue to have a relatively high 
  share of GDP in agriculture. Thus, the impacts of declines in agricultural output 
  on low-latitude countries are likely to be proportionately greater than any 
  gains in high-latitude countries (see <a href="#box193">Box 19-3</a>).</p>
<p>Vulnerability to the health effects of climate change also differs across regions 
  and within countries, and differences in adaptive capacity again are important. 
  <a href="#box194">Box 19-4</a> notes that wealthier countries will be better 
  able to cope with risks to human health than less wealthy countries. Risks also 
  vary within countries, however. In a country such as the United States, the 
  very young and the very old are most sensitive to heat waves and cold spells, 
  so regions with a rapidly growing or rapidly aging population would have relatively 
  large exposure to potential health impacts. In addition, poor people in wealthy 
  countries may be more vulnerable to health impacts than those with average incomes 
  in the same countries. For example, Kalkstein and Greene (1997) found that in 
  the United States, residents of inner cities, which have a higher proportion 
  of low-income people, are at greater risk of heat-stress mortality than others. 
  Differences among income groups may be more pronounced in developing and transition 
  countries because of the absence of the elaborate safety nets that developed 
  countries have constructed in response to other, nonclimate stresses.</p>
<p>These observations underscore one of the critical insights in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>: Adaptive capacity differs considerably between sectors and systems. 
  The ability to adapt to and cope with climate change impacts is a function of 
  wealth, technology, information, skills, infrastructure, institutions, equity, 
  empowerment, and ability to spread risk. The poorest segments of societies are 
  most vulnerable to climate change. Poverty determines vulnerability via several 
  mechanisms, principally in access to resources to allow coping with extreme 
  weather events and through marginalization from decisionmaking and social security 
  (Kelly and Adger, 2000). Vulnerability is likely to be differentiated by gender&#151;for 
  example, through the "feminization of poverty" brought about by differential 
  gender roles in natural resource management (Agarwal, 1991). If climate change 
  increases water scarcity, women are likely to bear the labor and nutritional 
  impacts.</p>
<p>The suggested distribution of vulnerability to climate change can be observed 
  clearly in the pattern of vulnerability to natural disasters (e.g., Burton et 
  al., 1993). The poor are more vulnerable to natural disasters than the rich 
  because they live in more hazardous places, have less protection, and have less 
  reserves, insurance, and alternatives. Adger (1999), for instance, shows that 
  marginalized populations within coastal communities in northern Vietnam are 
  more susceptible to the impacts of present-day weather hazards and that, importantly, 
  the wider policy context can exacerbate this vulnerability. In the Vietnamese 
  case, the transition to market-based agriculture has decreased the access of 
  the poor to social safety nets and facilitated the ability of rich households 
  to overexploit mangroves, which previously provided protection from storms. 
  Similarly, Mustafa (1998) demonstrates differentiation of flood hazards in lowland 
  Pakistan by social group: Insecure tenure leads to greater impacts on poorer 
  communities. See <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a> for further examples. The 
  natural disaster literature also concludes that organization, information, and 
  preparation can help mitigate large damages at a moderate cost (e.g., Burton 
  et al., 1993). This underscores the need for adaptation, particularly in poor 
  countries.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 19-4. The Health Impacts of Climate Change </b> 
      </div>
      <p>Global climate change will have diverse impacts on human health&#151;some 
        positive, most negative. Changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme 
        heat and cold, floods and droughts, and the profile of local air pollution 
        and aeroallergens will directly affect population health. Other effects 
        on population health will result from the impacts of climate change on 
        ecological and social systems. These impacts include changes in infectious 
        disease occurrence, local food production and nutritional adequacy, and 
        the various health consequences of population displacement and economic 
        disruption. Health impacts will occur very unevenly around the world. 
        In general, rich populations will be better protected against physical 
        damage, changes in patterns of heat and cold, introduction or spread of 
        infectious diseases, and any adverse changes in world food supplies.</p>
      <p>The geographic range and seasonality of various vector-borne infectious 
        diseases (spread via organisms such as mosquitoes and ticks) will change, 
        affecting some populations that currently are at the margins of disease 
        distribution. The proportion of the world's population living in 
        regions of potential transmission of malaria and dengue fever, for example, 
        will increase. In areas where the disease currently is present, the seasonal 
        duration of transmission will increase. Decreases in transmission may 
        occur where precipitation decreases reduce vector survival, for example. 
      </p>
      <p>An increased frequency of heat waves will increase the risk of death 
        and serious illness, principally in older age groups and the urban poor. 
        The greatest increases in thermal stress are forecast for mid- to high-latitude 
        (temperate) cities, especially in populations with limited air conditioning. 
        Warmer winters and fewer cold spells, because of climate change, will 
        decrease cold-related mortality in many temperate countries. Basic research 
        to estimate the aggregate impact of these changes has yet been limited 
        largely to the United States and parts of Europe. Recent modeling of heat-wave 
        impacts in 44 U.S. urban populations, allowing for acclimatization, suggests 
        that large U.S. cities may experience, on average, several hundred extra 
        deaths per summer. Although the impact of climate change on thermal stress-related 
        mortality in developing country cities may be significant, there has been 
        little research in such populations.</p>
      <p>For each anticipated adverse health impact, there is a range of social, 
        institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptation options that could 
        lessen that impact. The extent to which health care systems will have 
        the capacity to adopt them is unclear, however, particularly in developing 
        countries. There is a basic and general need for public health infrastructure 
        (programs, services, surveillance systems) to be strengthened and maintained. 
        The ability of affected communities to adapt to risks to health also depends 
        on social, political, and economic circumstances.</p>
