<h3>7.5.4. Adaptation Options </h3>
<p>Adaptation to climate changes involves planning of settlements and their infrastructure, 
  placement of industrial facilities, and making similar long-lived decisions 
  to reduce the adverse effects of events that are of low (but increasing) probability 
  and high (and perhaps rising) consequences. The adaptation response consists 
  of planning to reduce the sensitivity of key assets, designing resilience and 
  flexibility into the public and private infrastructure on appropriate time scales, 
  and managing settlements and institutions in a climate-resilient manner. The 
  following discussion of example options and strategies is divided into Planning 
  and Design, Management, and Institutional Frameworks (see <a href="317.htm#tab72">Table 
  7-2</a> for a summary): </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Planning and Design <br>
    - Take advantage of rapidly increasing populations in many regions. Growing 
    populations and cities provide economic advantages, not just costs (Satterthwaite, 
    1998). In the case of infrastructure, growing populations provide an opportunity 
    for new construction that can be designed for increased resilience and flexibility 
    with respect to climate change. With good planning and building practices 
    in new construction, considerable energy and environmental cost can be saved 
    at relatively small incremental construction costs compared with later retrofit 
    or protection (Rabinovitch, 1998). It can be less costly to design and build 
    flood works "oversized" in the beginning than to rebuild them later to add 
    capacity (this is not a foregone conclusion and depends on local uncertainties; 
    see Wood et al., 1997). <br>
    - Take advantage of replacement schedules. Many short-lived assets such as 
    consumer goods, motor vehicles, and space heating/cooling systems will be 
    replaced several times in the course of a few decades, offering considerable 
    opportunities for adaptation. Even medium-life assets such as industrial plants, 
    oil and gas pipelines, and conventional power stations are likely to be completely 
    replaced over such a time scale, though there will be less opportunity for 
    adaptation through upgrades and relocation. <br>
    - Community design tools such as floodplain and hillside building practices 
    and landscape design (zoning in developed countries; perhaps land-use planning 
    in developing countries) can be improved to limit damage. Reducing heat islands 
    (through judicious use of vegetation and light-colored surfaces, reducing 
    motor transportation, and taking advantage of solar resources) also should 
    be included in the package of possibilities.<br>
    - Improved sanitation, water supply, and electric power distribution systems 
    can be planned in an integrated manner, with sensitivity to the location of 
    air sheds and water sheds and efficient utilization of plant (e.g., properly 
    price water to reflect scarcity and reduce leakage in water supply systems) 
    (Wood et al., 1997; Lettenmaier et al., 1998; Tindleni, 1998). In some cases, 
    this requires "hardening" the system. In other cases, it requires flexible 
    approaches to plans for cleanup and movement of waste facilities in the flood 
    zone throughout the watershed and, for example, sanitation (Bartone, 1998). 
    There are more opportunities to do this in developing countries, which are 
    still acquiring their basic urban infrastructure. According to the United 
    Nations Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS) Global Urban Indicators Program 
    Web site in 1999, which developed city data collection systems in 237 cities 
    in 110 countries, about 38.5% of African urban households were connected to 
    water systems, 15.4% to sewerage, 46.9% to electricity, and 14.1% to telephones; 
    in Asia the corresponding connection rates were 52.4, 33.2, 82.5, and 26.5%, 
    respectively, and in the industrialized countries the percentages were 99.4, 
    95.8, 99.2, and 78.2% (UNCHS, 1999). <br>
    - Measures can be taken by governments to anticipate floods (Smith and Handmer, 
    1984), including "hard" engineering measures such as dams, levees, diversions, 
    channels, and retarding basins and "soft" or "nonstructural" methods such 
    as acquisition of properties, fiscal and financial incentives, regulations 
    such as zoning and building regulations, information and education campaigns, 
    forecasts/ warning systems/evacuation plans, salvage, emergency services, 
    insurance, and flood relief. "Designing with nature" is an effective strategy 
    for curbing flood losses even with current climate (Rabinovitch, 1998). In 
    some cases, this may require cleanup and movement of waste facilities in the 
    flood zone throughout the watershed, an issue also discussed in the SAR. FEMA 
    (1997) has concluded that the process of establishing and implementing state 
    and community comprehensive development and land-use plans provides significant 
    opportunities to mitigate damages caused by natural hazards. Losses from floods 
    in the upper Mississippi valley in 1996 (after some of these actions had been 
    taken) were two orders of magnitude lower than in 1993 for similar-sized floods. 
    Albergel and Dacosta (1996) propose analyzing runoff patterns from non-normal 
    storm events as a basis for more sustainable water resource management in 
    the specific instance of Senegal to deal with extreme events more effectively. 
    Colombo, Sri Lanka, has an ambitious plan to redesign and rebuild its flood 
    management system, incorporating improved maintenance of the existing system, 
    development of flood retention areas, cost-effective defined flood safety 
    margins, movement of people out of flood-prone lands immediately adjacent 
    to canals, and even a plan to move industries and public organizations out 
    of Colombo to hold constant the amount of unbuilt lands in the face of increased 
    urbanization (Gooneratne, 1998). <br>
    - Put key infrastructure in less vulnerable areas and (as appropriate) harden 
    against fire. Urban/ wildlands interface fires at locations such as Oakland/East 
    Bay Hills in California and Sydney, Australia, have yielded examples of design 
    practices to prevent such occurrences, including limiting development densities 
    and/or requiring large lot sizes; setting buildings back from flood, landslide, 
    and fault hazard zones; requiring adequate minimum paved street widths and 
    grades; requiring second access points; restricting the lengths of cul-de-sacs; 
    developing adequate water supply, flows, and redundant storage; and using 
    open space easements for fire breaks, equipment staging, and evacuation areas 
    (Topping, 1996). Wildlands fires also may affect settlements at a distance. 
    In 1997, health and haze effects of wildfires alone cost Indonesia US$1 billion 
    (EEPSEA, 1999; Wheeler, 2000). Total costs were about US$4.5 billion. <br>
    - Diversifying economic activity could be an important precautionary response 
    that would facilitate successful adaptation to climate change for resource-dependent 
    settlements. <br>
    - Use suitable design techniques to reduce cooling demand in many buildings. 
    For example, the U.S. Department of Energy's Building America Program uses 
    a systems engineering approach and works with the home building industry to 
    produce quality homes that use 30-50% less energy without increasing building 
    costs, that reduce construction time and waste by as much as 50%, and that 
    improve builder productivity. Eliminating inefficiencies is not strictly an 
    adaptation option, but these improvements also would have the benefit of reducing 
    the impact of warming on energy use. Adaptive measures that can effectively 
    reduce energy use relating to space cooling include better design of building 
    envelopes (which can cut cooling energy consumption by more than one-third 
    in current subtropical conditions or 5-30% under current European conditions-see 
    Chan and Chow, 1998; Balarus et al., 2000); high-albedo roofs (field tests 
    in Florida show savings of 2-40%-Akbari et al., 1999); and development of 
    urban trees and other greenery (Avissar, 1996; Spronkensmith and Oke, 1998; 
    Upmais et al., 1998), reducing summertime urban cooling loads by 3-5% (Sailor, 
    1998). See also Angioletti (1996) for criteria for sustainable building practices. 
    Low-income energy assistance and weatherization can play a role in assuring 
    equity (Miller et al., 2000). 
    <p> 
  <li>Management <br>
    - To stretch water supplies further, especially in high-income parts of developed 
    countries, institute market-like mechanisms and more efficient management 
    of water supplies. Experiments with market systems in the United States have 
    yielded water surpluses during drought in California, but such schemes must 
    consider distribution and equity effects when water consumption is very low 
    already (Hardoy et al., 2000), as well as external environmental effects on 
    third parties (Frederick, 1997). In some urban water systems, a significant 
    percentage of water put into the system is lost through leakage (e.g., 23%-or 
    about eight times the expected increase in demand resulting from climate change-in 
    the case of the southern part of Britain). Urban water systems may lose as 
    much as 40-60% of their water in distribution (Cairncross, 1990; Daniere, 
    1996; Rahman et al., 1997). Simply fixing leaks in cases such as this would 
    go a long way toward making sure that supplies are available (Arnell, 1998). 
    Boland (1997) found that mandating and widely promoting conservation measures 
    in the Washington, DC, area (such as a 50% increase in tariff level, industrial/commercial 
    water reuse and recycling, and a moderate conservation-oriented plumbing code) 
    could cut the increase in baseline water use in the year 2030 from 100% to 
    about 45%. This would more than offset any increase in use resulting from 
    climate warming. In developing-world cities' poor neighborhoods, where water 
    use already may be below levels that are conducive to good health, a mixed 
    response involving improving pipes, instituting neighborhood water wholesaling, 
    and improving water vendors and kiosks may be effective and affordable, if 
    coordinated with organized liquid waste disposal (Hardoy et al., 2000). <br>
    - Provide flood control and other forms of property assurance (not necessarily 
    insurance). On the insurance side, Germany and France have taken very different 
    approaches, with Germans adopting private insurance and minimal flood assistance 
    and the French adopting compulsory extended coverage under the "cat 'nat" 
    system. Neither system has proved to be able "to provide sufficient coverage 
    at reasonable cost (Gardette, 1997). The United States has been able to provide 
    flood insurance through a national system-at the cost of not controlling losses. 
    Much more activity is now going into loss prevention in the United States 
    (FEMA, 2000). The FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides grants 
    to states and local governments to reduce loss of life and property from natural 
    disasters and to enable mitigation measures to be implemented during the immediate 
    recovery from a disaster (FEMA, 2000). Some authors argue that loss prevention 
    could be anticipatory (Miller et al., 2000). <br>
    - Institute emergency preparedness and improve neighborhood response systems 
    and mutual assistance. This strategy is featured in many of the local initiatives 
    cataloged by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives 
    (ICLEI). Increasing access to cooling stations and city heat emergency response 
    plans for urban heat island effects are an example. Plans for extreme events 
    have improved considerably in the past 50 years, especially in developed countries, 
    and can be very effective against some of the anticipated consequences of 
    climate change. For example, preparation of disaster prevention organization 
    in Japan, including forecast techniques and information systems between weather 
    bureau/meteorological offices and individuals through local government/offices, 
    has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of deaths and houses destroyed, 
    especially for middle-sized typhoons (Class III) in the past 4 decades. This 
    trend suggests that disaster prevention systems such as river improvement, 
    establishment of information systems, improvement of typhoon forecasting, 
    and so forth were most effective for middle-sized typhoons (Fukuma, 1996; 
    Yoshino, 1996a). In most developing countries, local governments are particularly 
    weak and ineffective at environmental management and have little capacity 
    to integrate disaster preparedness into their current tasks and responsibilities. 
    For example, no significant change has been found in deaths per violent hurricane 
    in Bangladesh (Fukuma, 1999/2000), whereas there has been a significant decline 
    in the United States (Pielke, 1997). However, some of the differences may 
    be partly a result of a reduction in violent hurricanes making landfall in 
    populated areas. U.S. property damages increased while the incidence of hurricanes 
    fell (see Pielke and Landsea, 1998). Analysis of 15 years of simulation and 
    observations show that typhoon frequency has decreased off the Philippine 
    Islands and that the location of their generation shifts toward the east during 
    El Niño years (Matsuura et al., 1999). If similar conditions in typhoon regions 
    also occur under global warming, more effective prediction and tracking of 
    tropical typhoons in the 21st century could reduce typhoon disasters. <br>
    - Improve health education. Because the consequences of flood and drought 
    on water quantity and quality are fairly straightforward to predict, concerted 
    public awareness campaigns can significantly reduce adverse heath consequences 
    on populations from water-borne enteric diseases. For example, in the Marshall 
    Islands in 1997-1998, a public awareness campaign to boil all water supplies 
    was triggered by public health officials' concerns over dwindling water availability. 
    The number of hospitalizations for diarrheal disease was lower than normal 
    (Lewis et al., 1998). <br>
  <p>
  <li>Institutional Frameworks <br>
    - An institutional framework can be put in place that is more "friendly" for 
    adaptation strategies. Some key features of such a strategy include regularizing 
    property rights for informal settlements and other measures to allow low-income 
    groups to buy, rent, or build good-quality housing on safe sites. Much of 
    the poor-quality settlement infrastructure in the developing world in particular 
    is traceable to the questionable legal status of housing in these settlements 
    (e.g., Jaglin, 1994; Acho-Chi, 1998; Perlman, 1998). Thus, the occupants of 
    such housing units can be reluctant to spend much on quality construction 
    and may have little legal standing to demand municipal government services 
    such as piped water, sewerage, or waste collection. Perhaps more important, 
    even if they are financially able to do so, governments may be unable or reluctant 
    to extend services to households and communities lacking legal standing, especially 
    if such extension of service thereby "validates" the settlement. <br>
    - Build institutional capacity in environmental management. Capacity to adapt 
    to climate change, as with other environmental problems, will be realized 
    only if the necessary information is available, enterprises and organizations 
    have the institutional and financial capacity to manage change, and there 
    is an appropriate framework within which to operate. In this respect, autonomous 
    adaptation cannot necessarily be relied on. Governments may have a role in 
    terms of disseminating information (Miranda and Hordijk, 1998) and in any 
    case should not stand in the way through indifference, hostility, or inefficient 
    or corrupt management (Foronda, 1998). Building efficient environmental institutions 
    requires coherent policy, planning, mechanisms for implementation, procedures 
    for monitoring and corrective action, and a means for review. Mechanisms include 
    use of market-based regulatory instruments to limit contributory pollution 
    and to organize land use; development of appropriate roles for central and 
    local governments; involvment of communities and civil societies in adaptive 
    strategies (including traditional environmental knowledge and informal regulation 
    as appropriate); and expansion of the scope for international cooperation 
    (World Bank, 1999).
