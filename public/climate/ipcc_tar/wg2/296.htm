<h3>6.4.6. High-Latitude Coasts</h3>
<p>High-latitude coasts are highly susceptible to a combination of climate change 
  impacts in addition to sea-level rise, particularly where developed in ice-bonded 
  but otherwise unlithified sediments. In this context, atmospheric warming affects 
  ground-surface temperatures and thaw, as well as SST and sea ice.</p>
<p>Ground temperatures determine the presence of perennially frozen ground (permafrost), 
  which often contains large volumes of excess ice that may occur in the form 
  of massive ice. The seasonal cycle of ground and nearshore seawater temperatures 
  determines the depth of the seasonally active thaw layer in high-latitude beaches 
  and the nearshore, with implications for limiting beach scour during storms 
  (Nairn <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Deepening of the active layer (Vyalov <i>et al.</i>, 1998) also 
  can lead to melting of near-surface massive ice and may trigger additional coastal 
  slope failure (Dallimore <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Shaw <i>et al.</i>, 1998b).</p>
<p>Rapid coastal retreat already is common along ice-rich coasts of the Beaufort 
  Sea in northwestern Canada (e.g., Dallimore <i>et al.</i>, 1996), the United States, 
  and the Russian Arctic (e.g., Are, 1998). Where communities are located in ice-rich 
  terrain along the shore, warmer temperatures combined with increased shoreline 
  erosion can have a very severe impact. For example, at Tuktoyaktuk&#151;the 
  main community, port, and offshore supply base on the Canadian Beaufort sea 
  coast&#151;many structures are located over massive ice along eroding shore 
  (Wolfe <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>Coastal recession rates along the Arctic coast also are controlled by wave 
  energy during the short open-water season. An early study based on historical 
  records of shoreline recession, combined with hindcast waves derived from measured 
  wind and observed ice distributions, showed that coastal recession rates at 
  several sites are correlated with open-water fetch, storminess, and wave energy. 
  Using estimates of less extensive ice distribution under a doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, 
  Solomon <i>et al.</i> (1994) were able to demonstrate an increase in coastal erosion 
  rates to a mean value comparable to the maximum observed rates under present 
  climate conditions. In the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region, where many fine-grained 
  (mud and sand) shorelines and deltas now experience almost zero wave energy 
  (e.g., Forbes and Taylor, 1994), any increase in open water will lead to rapid 
  reworking and potentially substantial shoreline retreat.</p>
<p>Sea ice may erode the seabed in the nearshore zone, but it also may supply 
  shoreface sediments to the nearshore and beach (Reimnitz <i>et al.</i>, 1990; H&eacute;quette 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Thinner ice or later freeze-up resulting from climate warming 
  may lead to changes in nearshore ice dynamics and associated sediment transport. 
  Warmer temperatures and associated changes in winter sea-ice distribution at 
  mid-latitudes are expected to have a negative impact on coastal stability. Rapidly 
  eroding sandy coasts in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence are partially protected 
  in winter by development of an icefoot and nearshore ice complex. The strongest 
  storms and most persistent onshore winds occur in winter, partially overlapping 
  the ice season. Severe erosion in recent years has been linked to warmer winters 
  with late freeze-up&#151;an anticipated outcome of greenhouse warming (Forbes 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997b).</p>
