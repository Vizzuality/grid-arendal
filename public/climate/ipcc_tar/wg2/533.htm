<h3>14.2.2. Agriculture and Plantation Forestry </h3>
<h4><a name="14221"></a>14.2.2.1. Arable Farming and Tree Crops </h4>
<p>Agricultural lands (excluding pastures) represent approximately 19% of the 
  land area of Latin America. Over the past 40 years, the contribution of agriculture 
  to the GDP of Latin American countries has been on the order of 10%. Agriculture 
  remains a key sector in the regional economy because it employs an important 
  segment (30-40%) of the economically active population. It also is very 
  important for the food security of the poorest sectors of the population. </p>
<p>Arable farming is based on annual crops of cereals (wheat, maize, barley, rice, 
  oats), oil seeds (soybean, peanuts, sunflower), vegetables/tubercles (potatoes, 
  cassava), and a variety of perennial grasses, including specialty crops such 
  as cotton, tobacco, tea, coffee, cacao, sugarcane, and sugar beet. Major tree/shrub 
  crops include a large variety of fruits, oil palm, and others. This farm production 
  has given rise to associated activities&#151;such as beekeeping and bee products&#151;as 
  well as important agro-industries that produce valuable incomes in countries 
  that already have developed their own markets and exporting lines. </p>
<p>Although the more important commercial agriculture and agro-industry businesses 
  are well developed in a few countries, many Latin American economies rely on 
  small farming system production. In smaller and poorer countries, such as rural 
  communities in Central America and the Andean valleys and plateaus, agriculture 
  is the basis of subsistence lifestyles and the largest user of human capital. 
  For these countries, agriculture is the main producing sector; it undoubtedly 
  is severely affected by climate variations and would be seriously influenced 
  by climate change (Rosenzweig and Hillel, 1998). </p>
<p>Extremes in climate variability (e.g., the Southern Oscillation) already severely 
  affects agriculture in Latin America. In southeastern South America, maize and 
  soybean yields tend to be higher than normal during the warm Southern Oscillation 
  and lower during the cold phase (Berlato and Fontana, 1997; Grondona <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997; Magrin<i> et al.</i>, 1998; Baethgen and Romero, 2000). Contributions 
  to variability as a result of global warming and/or reduction in evapotranspiration 
  from forest loss would be added to this background variability, thereby aggravating 
  losses caused by extreme events.</p>
<p>Land-use choices will be affected by climate change. For example, increasing 
  precipitation in marginal areas could contribute to an increase in cropped lands 
  (Viglizzo <i>et al</i>., 1995). On the other hand, more favorable prices for 
  grain crops relative to those for cattle are causing an increase in cultivated 
  lands (Basualdo, 1995). The continued global trend to replace subsistence with 
  market crops also creates an increasing threat to soil sustainability and enhances 
  vulnerability to climate change.</p>
<p>Global warming and CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects on agricultural yields 
  vary by region and by crop. Under certain conditions, the positive physiological 
  effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment could be countered by temperature increases&#151;leading 
  to shortening of the growth season and changes in precipitation, with consequent 
  reductions in crop yields. Reduced availability of water is expected to have 
  negative effects on agriculture in Mexico (Mundo and Mart&iacute;nez-Austria, 
  1993; Conde <i>et al</i>., 1997b). However, increases in temperature would benefit 
  maize yields at high altitudes and lower the risk of frost damage (Morales and 
  Maga&ntilde;a, 1999). Several studies were carried out in the region to assess 
  the impact of climate change on annual crop yields. Most of these studies use 
  crop simulation models with GCMs and incremental (temperature and precipitation) 
  scenarios as climatic inputs. Baethgen and Magrin (1995) have shown that winter 
  crop yields in Uruguay and Argentina are more sensitive to expected variations 
  in temperature than precipitation. Under nonlimiting water and nutrient conditions 
  and doubled-CO<sub>2</sub>, the results for Argentina have shown that maize, 
  wheat, and sunflower yield variations are inversely related to temperature increments, 
  whereas soybean would not be affected for temperature increments up to 3&deg;C 
  (Magrin <i>et al</i>., 1997b, 1999a,b,c). Results obtained under rainfed conditions 
  for different crops and management approaches in the region are summarized in 
  <a href="534.htm#tab145">Table 14-5;</a> most of these results predict negative 
  impacts, particularly for maize. </p>
<p>Adaptive measures to alleviate negative impacts have been assessed in the region. 
  In Mexico, Conde <i>et al.</i> (1997a) found that increasing nitrogen fertilization 
  would be the best option to increase maize yields, although it would not be 
  economically feasible at all levels. In Argentina, the best option to improve 
  wheat, maize, and sunflower yields would be to adjust planting dates to take 
  advantage of the more favorable thermal conditions resulting from fewer late 
  frosts (Travasso <i>et al.</i>, 1999). However, this adaptive measure would 
  be insufficient for maintaining actual wheat and maize yield levels. Genetic 
  improvement will be necessary to obtain cultivars that are better adapted to 
  the new growing conditions. For wheat and barley crops in Uruguay and Argentina, 
  a longer growth season could be achieved by increasing photoperiodical sensitivity 
  (Hofstadter <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Travasso<i> et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Subsistence farming could be severely threatened in some parts of Latin America. 
  The global agricultural model of Rosenzweig <i>et al.</i> (1993) identifies 
  northeastern Brazil as suffering yield impacts that are among the most severe 
  in the world (see Reilly<i> et al.</i>, 1996; Canziani <i>et al.</i>, 1998; 
  Rosenzweig and Hillel, 1998). Because northeastern Brazil is home to more than 
  45 million people and is prone to periodic droughts and famines even in the 
  absence of expected climate changes, any changes in this region would have major 
  human consequences.</p>
<p>Climate changes can be expected to lead to changes in soil stocks of carbon 
  and nitrogen. In the Argentinean pampas, chemical degradation of soils, based 
  on climate changes predicted by the GISS GCM (Hansen <i>et al.</i>, 1988) at 
  an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 550 ppm, would reduce organic 
  nitrogen by 6-10% and organic carbon by 7-20% in the topsoil as a 
  result of lower dry-matter production and an increased mineralization rate (D&iacute;az 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1997).</p>
<p>Tree crops in locations where frost risk presents a limitation&#151;such as 
  coffee in Paran&aacute;, Brazil&#151;benefit from higher minimum temperatures 
  resulting from global warming (Marengo and Rogers, 2000).</p>
