<h4>8.3.3.3.Vulnerability of Reinsurers </h4>
<p>Reinsurance provides a significant and essential form of risk-spreading capacity 
  for primary insurers. For natural catastrophes, this risk-spreading normally 
  takes the form of an "excess" contract; primary insurers retain the 
  first tier of losses up to a "trigger point" above which they purchase 
  reinsurance, which operates up to a specified "exit point" or upper 
  limit. After the catastrophes of the past 2 decades, reinsurers are leaving 
  more of the risks with primary insurers, by increasing trigger points and lowering 
  exit points (Stipp, 1997).</p>
<p>Many of the vulnerabilities experienced by primary insurers also apply to reinsurers. 
  Several reinsurers became insolvent or were absorbed by larger firms during 
  the crisis period of 1989-1993 (ISO, 1999; Mooney, 2000). The unexpectedly 
  costly European windstorms of 1999 caused further problems (Andrews, 2000). 
  For example, an already weakened Australian reinsurer covering these storms 
  became insolvent despite total assets of US$2.3 billion (Howard, 2000a). According 
  to the Insurance Information Institute (III, 2000a), the world's catastrophe 
  reinsurance industry "&#133;lacks the capacity to insure mega-losses in 
  excess of US$50 billion." Government reinsurance systems also have shown 
  signs of stress&#151;as evidenced in France, where reserves fell by 50% during 
  the 1990s and reinsurance rates rose sharply (CCR, 1999).</p>
<h4><a name="8334"></a>8.3.3.4. Regulatory Uncertainties</h4>
<p>An additional source of vulnerability arises from regulatory uncertainties, 
  such as the degree of flexibility afforded in withdrawing from markets and risks 
  and in raising insurance prices (Davidson, 1996; Insurance Regulator, 1998; 
  III, 2000a; Ryland, 2000). In some jurisdictions, regulators have restricted 
  policy cancellations and nonrenewals following natural disaster losses such 
  as Hurricane Andrew (ISO, 1994a,b; Lecomte and Gahagan, 1998). Recent requests 
  from Florida insurers to double rates to protect insurers from hurricane risks 
  also have been resisted by regulators (III, 2000b). On the other hand, under 
  some conditions regulators can force insurers to withdraw from markets or otherwise 
  change their business practices so they maintain minimum solvency requirements 
  (GAO, 2000a). Pre-event accumulation and taxation of reserves also is an important 
  issue, and policies vary by country (Eley, 1996; Davidson, 1997).</p>
<h4><a name="8335"></a>8.3.3.5.Vulnerability of Local, State, and Federal Governments 
  as Providers of Insurance and Relief Assistance</h4>
<p>Under climate change, sustained increases in the frequency and/or intensity 
  of extreme weather events could stress the government sector itself as a provider 
  of insurance, a provider of domestic and international disaster preparedness/recovery 
  services, and an entity that itself manages property and undertakes weather-sensitive 
  activities (e.g., ranging from mail delivery to operation of military facilities 
  near coastlines or waterways). Increasingly, governments seek to cap or reduce 
  existing exposures (ISO 1994b, 1999; Gastel, 1999; Pullen 1999b; FEMA, 2000; 
  III, 2000b). Governments in developing countries participate especially deeply 
  in weather-related risks, given the low level of private insurance availability 
  and often a higher level of government-owned infrastructure.</p>
<p>Disaster relief provided by the U.S. government has totaled $30 billion since 
  1953 (Changnon and Easterling 2000). Nearly half of these losses have occurred 
  since 1990, and inflation-corrected payments rose six-fold between the late 
  1960s and the early 1990s (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 2000a). These costs do 
  not include temporary housing, unemployment insurance, and small business loans 
  also provided by government.</p>
<p>Governments are particularly sensitive to changes in flood- and crop-related 
  losses because they often are the primary or sole providers of such insurance, 
  and climate changes are expected to exacerbate these losses (see Chapters 4 
  and 5; Rosenzweig <i>et al</i>., 2000). U.S. government-insured crop/hail losses 
  grew 11-fold between the 1950s and the 1990s (Easterling <i>et al</i>., 2000a). 
  In Japan, the majority of international relief&#151;7-8 billion yen in 
  1990&#151;is related to floods (Sudo <i>et al</i>., 2000). Solvency is a material 
  issue for government programs, as exemplified by the $810 million deficit in 
  the U.S. flood insurance program in the mid-1990s (Anderson, 2000). U.S. crop 
  and flood insurance programs have never been profitable (GAO, 2000a; Heinz Center, 
  2000). The French catastrophe reinsurance fund (Caisse Centrale de R&eacute;assurance) 
  had become depleted as of the late 1990s and could no longer deal with a major 
  catastrophe from accumulated surplus (CCR, 1999).</p>
