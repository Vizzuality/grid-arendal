<h3>4.5.4. Impacts of Climate Change on Water Resources: An Overview</h3>
<p>This section explores the global-scale implications of climate change for water 
  resources stress and summarizes a few studies into climate change impacts on 
  several real-world water management systems. However, few published studies 
  consider impacts in quantitative terms on real-world systems; most published 
  studies infer changes in water resources from changes in streamflow. </p>
<p>It is very difficult to draw quantitative conclusions about the impacts of 
  climate change, for several reasons. Different studies have used different methodologies 
  and different scenarios, but, most important, different systems respond very 
  differently to climate change. It is possible, however, to make some qualitative 
  generalizations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In systems with large reservoir capacity, changes in resource reliability 
    may be proportionately smaller than changes in river flows.</li>
  <li>The potential impacts of climate change must be considered in the context 
    of other changes that affect water management. Few studies haveexplicitly 
    compared climate change with other pressures, but in many environments it 
    is likely that over a time horizon of less than 20 years, climate change impacts 
    will be very small relative to other pressures. This will depend on the system.</li>
  <li>The implications of climate change are likely to be greatest in systems 
    that currently are highly stressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the majority of studies of the impact of climate change on water resources 
  have concentrated on human aspects of the water environment. Only a very few 
  (e.g., Eheart et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 1999) have considered impacts on the 
  aquatic environment. Some of these studies are considered in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>, but it must be remembered that water resources systems in many parts 
  of the world increasingly are being managed to maintain instream and wetland 
  ecosystems. This either increases effective water demand or decreases water 
  availability.</p>
<p>Confidence in estimated quantitative impacts of climate change on water resources 
  generally is low, reflecting initial confidence in climate change scenarios 
  and low confidence in estimates of future pressures on water resources (as a 
  result of factors such as changes in demand or legislative requirements). However, 
  techniques for estimating the impacts of a given scenario are now well established.</p>
