<p><i><a name="figts7"></a></i><i>Water resources already are stressed in some 
  areas and therefore are highly vulnerable,</i> especially with respect to salinization 
  (parts of Australia) and competition for water supply between agriculture, power 
  generation, urban areas, and environmental flows (high confidence). Increased 
  evaporation and possible decreases in rainfall in many areas would adversely 
  affect water supply, agriculture, and the survival and reproduction of key species 
  in parts of Australia and New Zealand (medium confidence). [<a href="470.htm#1231">12.3.1</a>, 
  <a href="470.htm#1232">12.3.2</a>, <a href="472.htm#1246">12.4.6</a>, <a href="474.htm#1252">12.5.2</a>, 
  <a href="475.htm#1253">12.5.3</a>, <a href="477.htm#1256">12.5.6</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="532"></a>5.3.2. Ecosystems</h3>
<p><i>A warming of 1&deg;C would threaten the survival of species that currently 
  are growing near the upper limit of their temperature range</i>, notably in 
  marginal alpine regions and in the southwest of Western Australia. Species that 
  are unable to migrate or relocate because of land clearing, soil differences, 
  or topography could become endangered or extinct. Other Australian ecosystems 
  that are particularly vulnerable include coral reefs and arid and semi-arid 
  habitats. Freshwater wetlands in coastal zones in Australia and New Zealand 
  are vulnerable, and some New Zealand ecosystems are vulnerable to accelerated 
  spread of weeds. [<a href="471.htm#1242">12.4.2</a>, <a href="471.htm#1243">12.4.3</a>, 
  <a href="472.htm#1244">12.4.4</a>, <a href="472.htm#1245">12.4.5</a>, <a href="473.htm#1247">12.4.7</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="533"></a>5.3.3. Food Production</h3>
<p><i>Agricultural activities are particularly vulnerable to regional reductions 
  in rainfall in southwest and inland Australia (medium confidence).</i> Drought 
  frequency and consequent stresses on agriculture are likely to increase in parts 
  of Australia and New Zealand as a result of higher temperatures and El Ni&ntilde;o 
  changes (medium confidence). Enhanced plant growth and water-use efficiency 
  (WUE) resulting from CO<sub>2</sub> increases may provide initial benefits that 
  offset any negative impacts from climate change (medium confidence), although 
  the balance is expected to become negative with warmings in excess of 2-4&deg;C 
  and associated rainfall changes (medium confidence). This is illustrated in 
  <a href="#figts7">Figure TS-7</a> for wheat production in Australia, for a range 
  of climate change scenarios. Reliance on exports of agricultural and forest 
  products makes the region very sensitive to changes in production and commodity 
  prices that are induced by changes in climate elsewhere. [<a href="474.htm#1252">12.5.2</a>, 
  <a href="475.htm#1253">12.5.3</a>, <a href="477.htm#1256">12.5.6</a>, <a href="478.htm#1259">12.5.9</a>, 
  <a href="486.htm#1287">12.8.7</a>]</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand fisheries are influenced by the extent and location 
  of nutrient upwellings governed by prevailing winds and boundary currents. In 
  addition, ENSO influences recruitment of some fish species and the incidence 
  of toxic algal blooms. [<a href="476.htm#1255">12.5.5</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="534"></a>5.3.4. Settlements, Industry, and Human Health</h3>
<p><i>Marked trends toward greater population and investment in exposed regions 
  are increasing vulnerability to tropical cyclones and storm surges.</i> Thus, 
  projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity and possible changes in their 
  location-specific frequency, along with sea-level rise, would have major impacts&#151;notably, 
  increased storm-surge heights for a given return period (medium to high confidence). 
  Increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall would increase flood damages 
  to settlements and infrastructure (medium confidence). [<a href="467.htm#12151">12.1.5.1</a>, 
  <a href="468.htm#12153">12.1.5.3</a>, <a href="479.htm#1261">12.6.1</a>, <a href="480.htm#1264">12.6.4</a>]</p>
<p>There is high confidence that projected climate changes will enhance the spread 
  of some disease vectors, thereby increasing the potential for disease outbreaks 
  such as mosquito-borne Ross River virus and Murray Valley encephalitis, despite 
  existing biosecurity and health services. [<a href="481.htm#1271">12.7.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="535"></a>5.3.5. Key Adaptation Options</h3>
<p>Key adaptation options include improved WUE and effective trading mechanisms 
  for water; more appropriate land-use policies; provision of climate information 
  and seasonal forecasts to land users to help them manage for climate variability 
  and change; improved crop cultivars; revised engineering standards and zoning 
  for infrastructure development; and improved biosecurity and health services. 
  However, many natural ecosystems in Australia and New Zealand have only a limited 
  capacity to adapt, and many managed systems will face limits on adaptation imposed 
  by cost, acceptability, and other factors. [<a href="470.htm#1232">12.3.2</a>, 
  <a href="470.htm#1233">12.3.3</a>, <a href="477.htm#1256">12.5.6</a>, <a href="482.htm#1274">12.7.4</a>,
