<h3>18.4.3. Evaluation of Adaptation Options and Adaptation Costs</h3>
<p>Some very general steps for identifying and evaluating planned adaptations 
  are given in Carter <i>et al.</i> (1994) and UNEP (1998). Somewhat more detailed 
  procedures for evaluating anticipatory adaptation policies in the climate change 
  context are outlined in Smith and Lenhart (1996) and Smith (1997). This approach 
  addresses management of institutional processes and players and proposes net 
  benefits and implementability as central evaluative criteria. Numerous other 
  considerations are noted, including flexibility, benefits independent of climate 
  change ("no regrets"), local priorities, levels of risk, and time 
  frames of decisions. From a disaster management perspective, Tol <i>et al.</i> 
  (1996) argue that policies must be evaluated with respect to economic viability, 
  environmental sustainability, public acceptability, and behavioral flexibility. 
  Tol <i>et al.</i> (1999) apply these observations in an examination of adaptation 
  to increased risk of river floods in The Netherlands. They note several possible 
  adaptations, but none could be accomplished without creating significant distributional 
  and/or ecological impacts. None, therefore, would be feasible without enormous 
  political will and institutional reform. Klein and Tol (1997) and UNEP (1998) 
  describe methodologies for evaluation, including cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, 
  risk-benefit, and multi-criteria methods. Multi-criteria methods to evaluate 
  possible adaptation options have been demonstrated for coastal zones (El-Raey 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999) and agriculture (Mizina <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Fankhauser (1996) provides an economic efficiency framework in which adaptation 
  actions are considered justified as long as the additional costs of adaptation 
  are lower than the additional benefits from the associated reduced damages. 
  Optimal levels of adaptation (in an economic efficiency sense) are based on 
  minimizing the sum of adaptation costs and residual damage costs. Such studies 
  require the definition of a base case that involves estimation of autonomous 
  adaptations. These and other normative studies (e.g., Titus, 1990; Goklany, 
  1995) illustrate the range of principles and methods that have been proposed 
  for identifying, evaluating, and recommending (planned) adaptation measures.</p>

<p>There are, however, few comprehensive estimates of the costs of adaptation. 
  Mimura and Harasawa (2000) report estimates of 11.5-20 trillion Yen as 
  the cost of maintaining the functions of Japanese infrastructure against a 1-m 
  rise in sea level. Yohe and Schlesinger (1998) applied a cost-benefit rule to 
  adaptation decisions across a sample of the developed coastline of the United 
  States. With a 3% discount rate, their national estimates of the expected discounted 
  cost of protecting or abandoning developed coastal property in response to sea-level 
  rise that is based on a mean greenhouse emissions scenario is US$1.3 billion 
  with foresight and US$1.8 billion without. Their estimates climb to more than 
  US$4 billion and 5 billion, respectively, along the 1-m sea-level rise scenario 
  that matches the Mimura and Harasawa study. Between 55 and 70% of these costs 
  were attributed to planned adaptation. The remainder reflect estimates of residual 
  damage associated with abandoning property with and without completely efficient 
  autonomous adaptation. Indeed, the differences between the foresight and non-foresight 
  estimates can be regarded as estimates of the incremental cost of incomplete 
  autonomous adaptation in advance of planned responses.</p>
<p>On a more local scale, Smith <i>et al.</i> (1998) report cost estimates that 
  are clearly sensitive to design and evaluation criteria. For example, none of 
  the five flood protection strategies for the southernmost part of the Dutch 
  Meuse (assuming 10% more winter precipitation and a warming of 2&deg;C) would 
  achieve economic benefits that exceed their costs of DGL 243-1,505 million, 
  given a 5% discount rate. Moreover, only building quays would meet the benefit-cost 
  standard with a 5% discount rate. Nonetheless, the government chose a wildlife 
  renovation strategy on the basis of additional benefits for nature and recreation. 
  Smith <i>et al.</i> (1998) also report that the cost of raising the Northumberland 
  Bridge between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick to accommodate a 1-m sea-level 
  rise would be US$1 billion or 250,000, depending on whether the entire bridge 
  or only the portion that spanned the shipping lanes were raised. </p>
<p>Klein <i>et al.</i> (1999) develop a conceptual framework of the process of 
  planned adaptations, aimed at changing existing management practices in coastal 
  zones. In this model, adaptation is a continuous and iterative cycle, involving 
  several steps: information collection and awareness raising, planning and design 
  (incorporating policy criteria and development objectives), implementation, 
  monitoring, and evaluation (see <a href="#fig186">Figure 18-6</a>).</p>

<h3>18.4.4. Public Adaptation Decisions, Uncertainty, and Risk Management</h3>
<p>Research increasingly addresses how adaptation is considered in actual policy 
  decisionmaking. Stakhiv (1996) and Frederick (1997), dealing with the U.S. water 
  resources sector, conclude that existing institutions and planning processes 
  can deal with climate change; such processes essentially represent adaptive 
  management. As in many other sectors and circumstances, adaptation to climate 
  change hazards in the coastal zone is part of ongoing coastal zone management. 
  Adaptation to sea-level rise and extreme climate events is being included in 
  Japanese coastal policies (Mimura and Kawaguchi, 1997), British shoreline management 
  (Leafe <i>et al.</i>, 1998), and Dutch law and coastal zone management (Koster 
  and Hillen, 1995; Helmer <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Klein <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>Planning of adaptation invariably is complicated by multiple policy criteria 
  and interests that may be in conflict (Hareau <i>et al.</i>, 1999). For example, 
  the economically most efficient path to implement an adaptation option might 
  not be the most effective or equitable one. Moreover, decisions have to be made 
  in the face of uncertainty (Lempert <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Uncertainties that 
  are pertinent to adaptation are associated with climate change itself, its associated 
  extremes, their effects, the vulnerability of systems and regions, conditions 
  that influence vulnerability, and many attributes of adaptations, including 
  their costs, implementability, consequences, and effectiveness (Campos <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1996; Lansigan <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Handmer <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Murdiyarso, 
  2000).</p>
<p>Given these uncertainties, it is not surprising that adaptation strategies 
  frequently are described as forms of risk management. For example, adaptations 
  to deal with climate change impacts or risks to human health can be biological 
  (acquired immunity), individual (risk-aversion options), or social (McMichael 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Most social adaptation strategies are measures to reduce 
  health risks via public health programs (Patz, 1996; McMichael and Kovats, 2000). 
  Similarly, public adaptations via "disaster loss mitigation" (Bruce, 
  1999) are mainly risk management initiatives such as improved warning and preparedness 
  systems, less vulnerable buildings and infrastructure, risk-averse land-use 
  planning, and more resilient water supply systems. Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (1998), 
  Hisschem&ouml;ller and Olsthoorn (1999), and Perez <i>et al.</i> (1999) also 
  describe adaptations to climate change and extremes as modifications to existing 
  risk management programs. As de Lo&euml; and Kreutzwiser (2000) and others point 
  out, it remains unclear whether practices designed for historical climatic variability 
  will be able to cope with future variability.</p>
<p>To recognize these uncertainties, decision tools to help evaluate adaptation 
  options include risk-benefit and multi-criteria analyses (Klein and Tol, 1997). 
  Such evaluations are further complicated by the existence of secondary impacts 
  related to the adaptation itself. For example, water development projects (adaptations 
  to water supply risks) can have significant effects on local transmission of 
  parasitic diseases, including malaria, lymphatic filasiasis, and schistosomiasis 
  (Hunter <i>et al.</i>, 1993; McMichael and Kovats, 2000). Improved water supply 
  in some rural areas of Asia has resulted in a dramatic increase in Aedes mosquito 
  breeding sites and, consequently, outbreaks of dengue (WHO, 1997). Langen and 
  Tol (1999) provide examples of technical response options to climate hazards 
  that are counterproductive in the longer term. Existing resource management 
  programs do not necessarily consider changed risks or recognize local interests 
  and inequities (Primo, 1996). Wilhite's (1996) analysis of programs in 
  the United States, Australia, and Brazil shows the ineffectiveness of reactive 
  crisis management approaches and the need for proactive and cooperative planning. 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that planned adaptations to climate risks 
  are most likely to be implemented when they are developed as components of (or 
  as modifications to) existing resource management programs or as part of national 
  or regional strategies for sustainable development (Campos <i>et al.</i>, 1996; 
  Magalh&atilde;es, 1996; Theu <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Mimura, 1999a; Apuuli <i>et 
  al.</i>, 2000; Munasinghe, 2000; Osokova <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
