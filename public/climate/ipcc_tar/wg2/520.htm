<h4>14.1.2.1.2. Temperature </h4>
<p>Temperature in Latin America varies depending on the different subregions. 
  For tropical Latin America, temperature depends on cloud cover and altitude; 
  for other subregions, altitude, advection, and, at the southern cone, sea-surface 
  temperature (SST) play more predominant roles. The following description is 
  based on observed records; where possible, paleoclimatic information has been 
  included to present a wider view. </p>
<p>Central America shows different signs for temperature trends, according to 
  the specific area under analysis. For example, in Costa Rica, Alfaro (1993) 
  identifies a positive trend in daily maximum temperature. G&oacute;mez and Fern&aacute;ndez 
  (1996) and OCCH (1999) have identified negative trends for large areas of Costa 
  Rica and Honduras. MARENA's (2000) analyses of time series for Nicaragua 
  find only a small increase in mean temperature for Managua, which might be associated 
  with growth in urbanization.</p>
<p>For northwestern South America, monthly mean air temperature records show a 
  warming of 0.5-0.8&deg;C for the last decade of the 20th century (Pab&oacute;n, 
  1995a; Pab&oacute;n <i>et al</i>., 1999; Quintana-Gomez, 1999). Colombia also 
  presents increasing trends in the time series for the daily series of daily 
  mean and minimum temperature for the past 30-40 years. Similar patterns 
  have been observed in average monthly dew point and relative humidity (Mesa 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; P&eacute;rez <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Coastal cities from 
  northern Peru presented increases in air temperature since 1940, where 16 El 
  Ni&ntilde;o events were reported (Jaimes, 1997; SENAMHI, 1999).</p>
<p>In several cities in southern and southeastern Brazil, studies on long-term 
  tendencies for air temperature, from the beginning of the 20th century, have 
  indicated warming tendencies (Sansigolo <i>et al</i>., 1992). This could be 
  attributable to urbanization effects or to systematic warming observed in the 
  south Atlantic since the beginning of the 1950 s (Venegas <i>et al</i>., 1996, 
  1998). In the Amazon region, Victoria <i>et al.</i> (1998) have detected a significant 
  warming trend of +0.63&deg;C per 100 years. </p>
<p>Data since the beginning of the 20th century do not show a clear tendency in 
  mean temperature in the southern cone, but there is a decrease in the thermal 
  range. Moreover, south of 50&deg;S there are indications of a positive tendency 
  (Hoffman <i>et al</i>., 1997). However, when a shorter record is used for the 
  analysis, Argentina and Chile show a large warming rate of 1.2-3.0&deg;C 
  per 100 years (Rosenbl&uuml;th<i> et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<p>In south tropical Argentina, warming is observed only during the austral autumn 
  season (Bejar&aacute;n and Barros, 1998). The Argentina humid pampa, represented 
  by Buenos Aires, presents a warming as a result of urban effects (Camilloni 
  and Barros, 1997). Intensity and persistence of heat and cold waves present 
  tendencies in which the sign depends on the region (Rusticucci and Vargas, 1998).</p>
<p>In extra-tropical west South America (Chile), surface air temperature has varied 
  differently during the 20th century. South of approximately 45&deg;S, temperatures 
  have been increasing in stepwise fashion (Aceituno <i>et al.</i>, 1993). In 
  the area spanning about 35&deg;S to 45&deg;S, the most significant feature is 
  a well-defined cooling of 1-2&deg;C from the 1950s to the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>At decadal scales, multiple climate records throughout Latin America consistently 
  exhibit a shift in the mean during the mid-1970s. This could be a climatic consequence 
  of sudden changes in the climatology of the Pacific Ocean (Trenberth, 1990).</p>
<p>Using tree-ring and glacial evidence, summer temperatures in northern Patagonia 
  show distinct periods of higher and lower temperatures during the past 1,000 
  years (Villalba, 1994; Villalba<i> et al.</i>, 1997). For instance, there was 
  a cold interval from AD 900 to 1070, followed by a warm period from AD 1080 
  to 1250 (coincident with the Medieval warm period). Warm climatic episodes similar 
  to that observed during the 1980s may have occurred in the recent past under 
  preindustrial CO<sub>2</sub> levels in northern Patagonia (Chile and Argentina) (Villalba 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
<p>Latin America, in general, shows important variations in temperature, some 
  of which might be connected to change in climate. At the same time, these variations 
  might depend on the origin and quality of the data as well as the record periods 
  used for the studies.</p>
