<h2>12.2. Key Regional Concerns </h2>
<p>This section summarizes some key regional concerns regarding vulnerability 
  to climate change and impacts in Australia and New Zealand. They have not been 
  prioritized. Supporting details and references are provided in <a href="470.htm#123">Sections 
  12.3</a> through <a href="484.htm#128">12.8</a>. </p>
<p><i>Drought, Flood, and Water Supply:</i> Climate variability is a major factor 
  in the economies of both countries, principally through the flow-on effects 
  of ENSO-related major droughts on agriculture. Farmers in drought-sensitive 
  parts of both countries will be increasingly vulnerable if interannual droughts 
  occur more frequently or are more intense in the future. Less secure water supplies 
  would accentuate competition between users and threaten allocations for environmental 
  flows and future economic growth. Adelaide and Perth are the main cities with 
  water supplies that are most vulnerable to climate change; increasing salinity 
  in the Murray River is an increasing concern for Adelaide. Any increase in flood 
  frequency would adversely affect the built environment. In New Zealand, floods 
  and landslides are natural hazards that could increase in frequency and severity.</p>
<p><i>Ecosystem Uniqueness and Vulnerability:</i> Australia and New Zealand have 
  been isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years until relatively 
  recent human settlement. Some species exhibit quite limited ranges of average 
  climate. These two factors leave many of the region's ecosystems vulnerable 
  to climatic change and to invasion by exotic animal and plant species introduced 
  by human activity. This vulnerability has been exacerbated by fragmentation 
  of ecosystems through land-use changes. </p>
<p><i>Coral Reefs:</i> Australia has one of the greatest concentrations of coral 
  reefs in the world. Rising sea level by itself may not be deleterious. However, 
  the combination of sea-level rise with other induced stresses&#151;notably, 
  increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (which leads to a decrease in calcification 
  rates of corals); increasing sea temperatures, leading to coral bleaching; possibly 
  increased riverine outflow events (low salinity and high pollution); and damage 
  from tropical cyclones&#151;may put much of this resource at risk.</p>
<p><i>Alpine Areas:</i> In Australia, significant warming will raise snowlines, 
  diminish the ski industry, and threaten alpine ecosystems. In New Zealand, snowline 
  changes and the advance or retreat of glaciers also depend on changes in the 
  strength and local orientation of mid-latitude westerlies. Options for relocation 
  of the ski industry are limited by the relatively low altitude of Australia's 
  alpine regions and by rugged terrain and conservation estate regulations in 
  New Zealand.</p>
<p><i>Agricultural Commodities and Terms of Trade:</i> A major fraction of exports 
  from both Australia and New Zealand are agricultural and forestry products, 
  production of which is sensitive to any changes in climate, water availability, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, and pests and diseases. Returns from these commodities 
  could be affected by the projected increase in agricultural production in mid- 
  to high-latitude northern hemisphere countries and resulting impacts on commodity 
  prices and world trade.</p>
<p><i>Increasing Coastal and Tropical Exposure:</i> Major population and economic 
  growth in coastal areas, especially the tropical and subtropical east coast 
  of Australia, are leading to greatly increased vulnerability to tropical cyclones 
  and storm surges, as well as riverine and estuarine flooding. Rising sea level 
  will accentuate these problems, as would any increase in storm intensities or 
  a more poleward movement of tropical cyclones. Rising sea level also will increase 
  the salinity of estuarine and coastal aquifer groundwater.</p>
<p><i>Indigenous People:</i> In both countries, indigenous peoples (Aborigines 
  and Torres Straits Islanders in Australia, Maori in New Zealand, as well as 
  Pacific islanders) are among the most disadvantaged members of the population. 
  They generally have lower incomes, and many live in isolated rural conditions 
  or in the sometimes poorly serviced and low-lying margins of large towns and 
  cities. They are more exposed to inadequate water supplies, climatic disasters, 
  and thermal stress and are more vulnerable to an increase in the prevalence 
  of pests and diseases.</p>
