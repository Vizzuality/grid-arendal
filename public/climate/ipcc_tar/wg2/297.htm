<h2>6.5. Socioeconomic Impacts of Climate Change</h2>
<p>In the past decade, some progress has been made in evaluating potential socioeconomic 
  impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on coastal and marine systems. 
  This progress, however, has not been as substantial as that relating to biogeophysical 
  impacts; nor has it been especially comprehensive (Turner <i>et al.</i>, 1995, 1996). 
  To date, emphasis has been in three areas. First, research has focused on the 
  coastal zone itself (we are not aware of any studies of the socioeconomic impact 
  of climate change on open-ocean marine ecosystems). Second, there has been an 
  emphasis on the potential socioeconomic impact of sea-level rise but little 
  on any other climate change variables. Third, emphasis has been on economic 
  effects, not on impacts on social and cultural systems. These emphases are evident 
  in the following review, in which we consider socioeconomic impacts initially 
  as a component of the methodology for vulnerability assessment and then through 
  economic cost-benefit analyses of coastal zones in general and infrastructure 
  developments in particular. In these cases, "benefits" derive from 
  the inclusion of adaptation options&#151;primarily shore protection&#151;into 
  the analyses to derive some net cost. Finally, we consider attempts that have 
  been made to "value" natural systems, as well as the potential social 
  and cultural impacts of climate change.</p>

<h3>6.5.1. Socioeconomic Impacts as Part of Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
<p>In the SAR, Bijlsma <i>et al.</i> (1996) reviewed several country case studies that 
  had applied the IPCC Common Methodology for assessing the vulnerability of coastal 
  areas to sea-level rise. These case studies offered important insights into 
  potential impacts and possible responses. Many of the assessments emphasized 
  the severe nature of existing coastal problems such as beach erosion, inundation, 
  and pollution, as well as the effects of climate change acting on coastal systems 
  that already are under stress.</p>
<p>The Common Methodology defined <i>vulnerability</i> as a country's degree 
  of capability to cope with the consequences of climate change and accelerated 
  sea-level rise. The methodology of seven consecutive analytical steps allowed 
  for identification of coastal populations and resources at risk and the costs 
  and feasibility of possible responses to adverse impacts. The SAR also identified 
  the strengths and weaknesses of the Common Methodology. More recently, Klein 
  and Nicholls (1999) have evaluated the IPCC's approach and results, concluding 
  that the Common Methodology has contributed to understanding the consequences 
  of sea-level rise and encouraged long-term thinking about coastal zones. They 
  went on to develop a new conceptual framework for coastal vulnerability assessment 
  that identifies the main components of the natural system and the socioeconomic 
  system, as well as the linkages between them and climate change and other change 
  variables. This framework is outlined in <a href="#box6-5">Box 6-5</a>.</p>
<p>In the SAR, data on socioeconomic impacts were derived from country and global 
  vulnerability assessment studies. Figures for several countries were given relating 
  to the population affected, capital value at loss, and adaptation/protection 
  costs (Bijlsma <i>et al.</i>, 1996, <a href="361.htm#tab93">Table 9-3</a>). 
  For the coastal zone, the authors concluded that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There will be negative impacts on several sectors, including tourism, 
  freshwater quality and supply, fisheries and aquaculture, agriculture, human 
  settlements, financial services, and human health.
  <li>The number of people potentially affected by storm-surge flooding is 
  expected to double (or triple) in the next century, ignoring potential adaptation 
  and population growth.
  <li>Protection of low-lying island states and nations with large deltaic 
  areas is likely to be very costly.
  <li>Adaptation to sea-level rise and climate change will involve important 
  tradeoffs, which may include environmental, economic, social, and cultural values.
</ul>
<p>Since the SAR, there have been several summaries of the socioeconomic results 
  of the vulnerability assessment studies, presenting data at local, regional, 
  and global levels. Examples include case studies of Poland and Estonia (Kont 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Zeider, 1997), the Philippines (Perez <i>et al.</i>, 1999), Bangladesh 
  (Ali, 1999), Egypt (El-Raey <i>et al.</i>, 1999), and The Gambia and Abidjan (Jallow 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999), as well as the regional analyses and global synthesis of Nicholls 
  and Mimura (1998). The initial global vulnerability assessment has been revised 
  on the basis of scenarios for global sea-level rise derived from the Hadley 
  Centre's HadCM2 ensemble simulations and HadCM3 simulations for GHG-only 
  forcing (Nicholls <i>et al.</i>, 1999). This assessment indicated that by the 2080s, 
  the potential number of people flooded by storm surge in a typical year will 
  be more than five times higher than today (using a sea-level rise of 0.38 m 
  from 1990 to 2080) and that between 13 million and 88 million people could be 
  affected even if evolving protection is included. Broadly similar results are 
  given in the study undertaken by DETR (1999). However, they note that the flood 
  impacts of sea-level rise are reduced by emissions scenarios that lead to stabilization 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>. By the 2080s, the annual number of people flooded is estimated to be 
  34 million under the 750-ppm scenario and 19 million under the 550-ppm scenario.</p>
<p>Klein and Nicholls (1999) have categorized the potential socioeconomic impacts 
  of sea-level rise as follows</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct loss of economic, ecological, cultural, and subsistence values 
  through loss of land, infrastructure, and coastal habitats
  <li>Increased flood risk of people, land, and infrastructure and the aforementioned 
  values
  <li>Other impacts related to changes in water management, salinity, and biological 
  activities.
</ul>
<p>They also developed a methodology that has not yet been applied in any case 
  studies.</p>

    <p><b>Box 6-5. Conceptual Framework for Coastal Vulnerability Assessment</b><br>
    </p>
      <p>In the scheme illustrated below, analysis of coastal vulnerability starts 
        with a notion of the natural system's susceptibility to the biogeophysical 
        effects of sea-level rise and its capacity to cope with these effects 
        (resilience and resistance). Susceptibility reflects the coastal system's 
        potential to be affected by sea-level rise; resilience and resistance 
        determine the system's robustness or ability to continue functioning 
        in the face of possible disturbance. Together, these factors determine 
        the natural vulnerability of the coastal zone.</p>

          </td>
		</tr>
		</table>
      <p>Resilience and resistance are functions of the natural system's 
        capacity for autonomous adaptation, which represents the coastal system's 
        natural adaptive response. Resilience and resistance often are affected 
        by human activities, which need not only be negative: Planned adaptation 
        can reduce natural vulnerability by enhancing the system's resilience 
        and resistance, thereby adding to the effectiveness of autonomous adaptation.</p>
      <p>The biogeophysical effects of sea-level rise impose a range of potential 
        socioeconomic impacts. This impact potential is the socioeconomic equivalent 
        of susceptibility; it is dependent on human influences. Socioeconomic 
        vulnerability is determined by the impact potential and society's 
        technical, institutional, economic, and cultural ability to prevent or 
        cope with these impacts. As with the natural system's resilience 
        and resistance, the potential for autonomous adaptation and planned adaptation 
        determines this ability to prevent or cope.</p>
      <p>Dynamic interaction takes place between natural and socioeconomic systems. 
        Instead of being considered as two independent systems, they are increasingly 
        regarded as developing in a co-evolutionary way, as shown by the feedback 
        loop from the socioeconomic system to the natural system.</p>
