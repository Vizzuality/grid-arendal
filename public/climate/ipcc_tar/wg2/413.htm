<p><b>Adaptation to Climate Change in Asia</b></p>
<p>The impacts of climate change are likely to be felt most severely in the majority 
  of developing countries of Asia because of resource and infrastructure constraints 
  (e.g., disparities in income level, technological gaps). These countries must 
  develop and implement incremental adaptation strategies and policies to exploit 
  "no regret" measures and "win-win" options. Detailed and 
  reliable regional scenarios of climate change must be developed and used in 
  rigorous vulnerability analysis (e.g., low-probability/high-consequence events 
  vs. high-probability/ high-consequence events, risk perceptions). To understand 
  which adaptation opportunities will be most cost-effective and have the greatest 
  value, emphasis must be given to characteristics of system vulnerability such 
  as resilience, critical thresholds, and coping ranges, which are highly dependent 
  on regions and nations. </p>
<p>It is important to consider climate change in planning, designing, and implementing 
  development activities in climate-sensitive resources for Asia, particularly 
  where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Climate change may cause irreversible or catastrophic impacts</li>
  <li>Decisions with a long lifetime, such as building of infrastructure, are 
    being made</li>
  <li>Development trends such as development of low-lying coastal areas increase 
    vulnerability to climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general strategies on adaptation can be used. The first is a macro strategy 
  that involves rapid development. Sustainable and equitable development will 
  increase income levels, education, and technical skills and improve public food 
  distribution, disaster preparedness and management, and health care systems 
  in developing countries of Asia. All of these changes could substantially enhance 
  social capital and reduce the vulnerability of these countries to climate change.</p>
<p>The second strategy is a micro strategy that involves modifying the management 
  of sectors that are most sensitive to climate change. This approach entails 
  developing new institutions or modifying existing institutions related to these 
  sectors that promote rather than discourage adaptation to climate change. It 
  also involves modifying climate-sensitive infrastructures that are already planned 
  or implemented or other long-term decisions that are sensitive to climate to 
  incorporate the risks of climate change.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing principles, specific adaptation strategies for countries 
  in the Asian region have been identified in the relevant sectors (e.g., water 
  resources, agriculture and food security, coastal resources, human health, and 
  ecosystems and biodiversity). These strategies are summarized in <a href="#box111">Box 
  11-1</a>.</p>

<p>Each subregion has its priority adaptation sector for its own situation. Food 
  security, disaster preparedness and management, soil conservation, and human 
  health sectors also appear to be crucial for countries with large populations 
  (e.g., China, India, Bangladesh). Adaptations proposed for human health, which 
  essentially involve improving the health care system, are changes that are needed 
  anyway to address the current human health situation in many Asian countries. 
  Adaptations to deal with sea-level rise, potentially more intense cyclones, 
  and threats to ecosystems and biodiversity should be considered high priority 
  in temperate and tropical Asian countries.</p>
<p>The design of an optimal adaptation program in any country would have to be 
  based on comparison of damages avoided with costs of adaptation. Other factors 
  also should enter the decisionmaking process, such as the impacts of policies 
  on society in terms of employment generation and opportunities, improved air 
  and water quality, and the impacts of policies on broader concerns for equitable 
  and sustainable development.</p>
