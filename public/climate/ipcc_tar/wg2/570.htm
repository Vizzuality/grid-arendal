<h4><a name="15242"></a>15.2.4.2. Potential Indirect Health Impacts of Climate Change</h4>
<h4><a name="152421"></a>15.2.4.2.1. Vector-borne diseases</h4>
<h6><a name="1524211"></a>15.2.4.2.1.1. Encephalitis</h6>
<p>In the midwestern United States, outbreaks of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) 
  appear to be associated with a sequence of warm, wet winters; cold springs; 
  and hot, dry summers (Monath, 1980). In the western United States, a 3-5&deg;C 
  increase in mean temperature may cause a northern shift in the distribution 
  of western equine encephalitis (WEE) and SLE outbreaks and a decrease in the 
  range of WEE in southern California (Reeves <i>et al</i>., 1994). In Canada, 
  the ranges of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), snowshoe hare virus (SHV), 
  and WEE probably would expand with global warming. All three already have been 
  reported in Canada or adjacent U.S. states, albeit sporadically (McLean <i>et 
  al</i>., 1985; Artsob, 1986; Tourangeau <i>et al</i>., 1986; Keane and Little, 
  1987; Heath <i>et al</i>., 1989; Carman <i>et al</i>., 1995; Duncan <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).<br>
</p>
<h6><a name="1524212"></a>15.2.4.2.1.2. Malaria </h6>
<p>In the United States, sporadic autochthonous malaria transmission was observed 
  in New York and New Jersey during the 1990s (Layton <i>et al</i>., 1995; Zucker, 
  1996). Malaria is imported into Canada, however.<br>
</p>
<p>According to studies by Martens <i>et al</i>. (1995), Martin and Lefebvre (1995), 
  and Duncan (1996), with global warming, malaria may extend northward into temperate 
  countries. These studies note, however, that many of these countries had regular 
  epidemics of malaria in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century 
  and that continued and increased application of control measures&#151;such as 
  water management, disease surveillance and prompt treatment of cases&#151;probably 
  would counteract any increase in vectorial capacity. <br>
</p>
<p>Malaria once prevailed throughout the United States and southern Canada (Bruce-Chwatt, 
  1988). As recently as 1890, the census recorded more than 7,000 malaria deaths 
  per 100,000 people across the American South and more than 1,000 malaria deaths 
  per 100,000 people in states such as Michigan and Illinois. It is important 
  to note that diagnoses and reporting did not meet today's standards. By 
  1930, malaria had been controlled in the northern and western United States 
  and generally caused fewer than 25 deaths per 100,000 people in the South. In 
  1970, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Advisory Panel on Malaria recommended 
  that the United States be included in the WHO official register of areas where 
  malaria had been eradicated. <br>
</p>
<p>In Canada, vivax malaria became widespread at the end of the 18th century, 
  when refugees from the southern United States settled in large numbers as far 
  north as "the Huron" in the aftermath of the American War of Independence. 
  Malaria was further spread with the building of the Rideau Canal (1826-1832) 
  (Duncan, 1996). By the middle of the 19th century, malaria extended as far north 
  as 50&deg;N. In 1873, the great malarious district of western Ontario was only 
  a fraction of a large endemic area, extending between Ontario and the state 
  of Michigan. In Canada, the disease disappeared at the end of the 19th century 
  (Bruce-Chwatt, 1988; Haworth, 1988; Duncan, 1996). <br>
</p>
<p>The history of malaria in North America underscores the fact that increased 
  temperatures may lead to conditions that are suitable for the reintroduction 
  of malaria to North America. Socioeconomic factors such as public health measures 
  will continue to play a large role in determining the existence or extent of 
  such infections (Shriner and Street, 1998).</p>
<h6><a name="1524213"></a>15.2.4.2.1.3. Dengue and Yellow Fever </h6>
<p>Although the Aedes aegypti mosquito already is found in the southern United 
  States, socioeconomic factors play a large role in determining the actual risk 
  of climate-sensitive diseases (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). For example, 
  socioeconomic differences between Texas and bordering Mexico determine disease 
  incidence: A total of 43 cases of dengue were recorded in Texas during 1980-1996, 
  compared to 50,333 in the three contiguous border states in Mexico (Reiter, 
  1999). </p>
<h6><a name="1524214"></a>15.2.4.2.1.4. Lyme Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted 
  Fever</h6>
<p>Lyme disease&#151;the most common vector-borne disease in the United States&#151;currently 
  circulates among white-footed mice in woodland areas of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, 
  upper Midwest, and West Coast of the United States (Gubler, 1998). In 1994, 
  more than 10,000 cases of the disease were reported (Shriner and Street, 1998). 
  Although possible tick vectors have been reported in various parts of Canada, 
  self-reproducing populations of infected ticks are believed to occur only in 
  Long Point, Ontario (Barker <i>et al</i>., 1992; Duncan <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Lyme disease has been predicted to spread within Canada with increased temperatures 
  (Grant, 1991; Canadian Global Change Program, 1995; Environment Canada, 1995; 
  Guidotti, 1996; Hancock and Davies, 1997). However, in assessing climate-induced 
  risks for Lyme disease, the ecology of two mammalian species along with projections 
  for land use make predictions very difficult (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>). Finally, Grant (1991) has suggested that, with warming, Rocky Mountain 
  Spotted Fever might increase in some localities in Canada.</p>
