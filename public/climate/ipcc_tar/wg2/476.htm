<h3>12.5.4. Forestry </h3>
<p>When Europeans arrived in Australia in 1788, there were approximately 70 Mha 
  of forests. Since then, 40% has been cleared and a similar amount has been affected 
  by logging; only about 25% remains relatively unaffected (Graetz <i>et al.</i>, 
  1995; State of the Environment, 1996). Nationally, land clearing still exceeds 
  planting, although this varies greatly across the states, and is occurring mainly 
  in areas defined as woodlands. Plantations have been expanding in Australia 
  at an increasing rate since 1990, currently by more than 50,000 ha yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, 2000). Much of this planting is occurring 
  on farmed land and receives federal government support (Race and Curtis, 1997). 
  Additional plantings are occurring to ameliorate land degradation problems such 
  as erosion, waterlogging, and salinization, and further plantings are associated 
  with the establishment of carbon sinks (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1999d).</p>
<p>Forests cover about 8.1 Mha (29%) of New Zealand's land area. Of this, 
  about 6.4 Mha are in natural forest and 1.7 Mha in planted production forests. 
  New forest establishment increased markedly during the 1990s. Almost all areas 
  of harvested forest are replanted; during 1998, 52,000 ha of new forest plantings 
  occurred (Statistics New Zealand, 1999).</p>
<p>Climatic factors are well known to influence species distributions (Hughes 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Austin <i>et al.</i>, 1997) and productivity (Landsberg 
  and Waring, 1997). CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations also have a direct effect (Curtis 
  and Wang, 1998). Kirschbaum (1999a,b) has used a forest growth model to assess 
  response to climate change and CO<sub>2</sub> increases for a site near Canberra. 
</p>
<p>Howden and Gorman (1999) review this and other work on the impact of global 
  change on Australian temperate forests. Productivity of exotic softwood and 
  native hardwood plantations is likely to be increased by CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization 
  effects, although the amount of increase is limited by various acclimation processes 
  and environmental feedbacks through nutrient cycling. Where trees are not water-limited, 
  warming may expand the growing season in southern Australia, but increased fire 
  hazard and pests may negate some gains. Reduced rainfall in more recent scenarios 
  would have adverse effects on productivity and increase fire risk. Increased 
  rainfall intensity would exacerbate soil erosion problems and pollution of streams 
  during forestry operations. In <i>Pinus radiata</i> and Eucalyptus plantations, 
  fertile sites are more likely to have increased productivity for moderate warmings, 
  whereas infertile sites could have decreased production. To date, large uncertainties 
  have lowered the priority of climate change in management considerations. </p>
<p>Despite large year-to-year climatic variability, many Australian native species 
  are confined in their natural climatic range to within 1 or 2&deg;C average 
  mean temperature (Hughes <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Pouliquen-Young and Newman, 1999), 
  so without human intervention their survival will be threatened by warmings 
  outside these ranges (see <a href="471.htm#1241">Section 12.4.1</a>). </p>
<p>Of New Zealand's 13 Mha of land used for pastoral farming, at current 
  prices 3-5 Mha of hill country would yield higher returns under forestry. 
  Such land is being converted to plantation forestry at a rate of 40,000 ha yr<sup>-1</sup>, 
  from an initial rate averaging 60,000 ha yr<sup>-1</sup> over the past decade 
  (Statistics New Zealand, 1998); the recent decrease in planting rate reflects 
  current lower wood prices. Carbon trading would facilitate increased planting 
  rates, possibly up to 90,000 ha yr<sup>-1</sup> (MAF, 1999). Steep land is particularly 
  uneconomic to manage for pastoral farming and could be converted to forest or 
  scrubland by planting or abandonment and regrowth. Control of possums (a pest 
  introduced from Australia by early European settlers) to minimize transfer of 
  diseases to farm animals has the added benefit of improving the health and regenerative 
  capacity of some indigenous forests (Ministry for the Environment, 1997).</p>
<p>Biomass from forest residues and purpose-grown crops already provides 6% of 
  New Zealand's primary energy supply (EECA, 1996) and significant energy 
  resources for Australia. Biomass use is expected to increase substantially over 
  the next decade (Sims, 1999), partly as a response to constraints on net carbon 
  emissions. This also may encourage increased forestry planting rates. </p>
<p>The direct effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on yield from <i>radiata</i> 
  pine plantations are expected to be small in New Zealand. However, regional 
  uncertainties remain with regard to possible increased growth loss under warmer, 
  wetter conditions as a result of existing and new pests and diseases and losses 
  from wind and fire associated with extreme weather events. Biosecurity mechanisms 
  are being improved in New Zealand and abroad to better manage risk. Long-term 
  trends in forest nutritional status are being examined. Indicators of sustainable 
  forestry practices are receiving increasing attention. Risks from fire and wind 
  also are being investigated in New Zealand. Systems to measure and predict effects 
  on carbon sequestration in plantation forests are being improved.</p>

<h3>12.5.5. Fisheries</h3>
<p>Australia specializes in high-value, low-tonnage fisheries such as lobsters, 
  pearl oysters, prawns, abalone, and tuna. Totaling about AU$2 billion yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (ABARE, 2000), these fisheries are a significant local primary industry. Tonnage 
  produced is very small by world standards because Australian surface waters 
  generally are low in nutrients as a result of prevailing winds and boundary 
  currents (Kailola <i>et al.</i>, 1993). New Zealand's Exclusive Economic 
  Zone (EEZ) is one of the largest in the world (Statistics New Zealand, 1999), 
  and its NZ$1.23 billion export revenues from fisheries in 1998 constituted 5.5% 
  of total export revenue for that year (Seafood New Zealand, 2000). </p>
<p>For both countries, relationships have been established between recruitment 
  of some fish species and climate variations, suggesting that fisheries in the 
  region will be sensitive to climate change. However, it is uncertain how local 
  winds and boundary currents that advect larvae and affect upwelling of nutrients 
  might respond to GHG-induced climate changes, and downscaling from relevant 
  global climate change model fields has not yet been done. Hence, this section 
  concentrates on reporting studies of observed sensitivities of fisheries in 
  the Australasian region to climate variability. There is insufficient information 
  to date to project the impact of climate change on fisheries productivity.</p>
<p>Understanding of existing processes suggests that if El Ni&ntilde;o were to 
  become a more prevalent condition, the Indonesian throughflow and the Leeuwin 
  current (Meyers, 1996) could weaken. If winds were favorable for upwelling, 
  the west coast of Australia could undergo a dramatic shift from a low-production, 
  high-biodiversity ecosystem to a more productive ecosystem typical of temperate 
  shelves. </p>
<p>Australia's single largest fishery is western rock lobster (AU$260 million 
  yr<sup>-1</sup>&#151;ABARE 2000). Presently, settlement of larval lobsters (and adult catch 
  rates some years later) is much higher in La Ni&ntilde;a years (high coastal 
  sea level, high SST, strong Leeuwin current) than in El Ni&ntilde;o years (Pearce 
  and Phillips, 1994). Because the mechanism appears to be through larval advection 
  processes, however, it is unclear whether the species' spawning strategy 
  would adapt to a sustained shift to a weaker Leeuwin current. Many other western 
  Australian fisheries also correlate (some positively, some negatively) with 
  ENSO (Caputi <i>et al.</i>, 1996), through unknown mechanisms. Whether these mechanisms 
  would continue to operate under the combined influence of a sustained weaker 
  Leeuwin current (which tends to reduce temperatures) and a worldwide rise in 
  SST is unknown. Southern bluefin tuna spawn where the Indonesian throughflow 
  enters the Indian Ocean, but the impact of a possibly reduced throughflow also 
  is unknown.</p>
<p>Conditions on the south coast of Australia also are influenced&#151;but to 
  a lesser degree&#151;by the Leeuwin current, which tends to keep near-surface 
  nutrient levels low. In addition, winds are favorable to downwelling, except 
  during some summers, when Australia's only example of strong classical 
  wind-driven coastal upwelling occurs off Portland, Victoria. Small meridional 
  shifts of the subtropical high-pressure ridge modulate summer upwelling. Ecosystem 
  impacts of this are poorly known.</p>
<p>On the east coast of Australia, the East Australian Current (EAC) is a dominant 
  influence on coastal marine ecosystems. The EAC enhances upwelling and primary 
  production (Hallegraeff and Jeffrey, 1993) and presumably fisheries, although 
  this has yet to be demonstrated apart from its effect on the distribution of 
  several tuna species (Lyne <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Farther north, Vance <i>et al.</i> (1985) 
  report a correlation of catches of banana (but not tiger) prawns with rainfall, 
  probably as a result of runoff-driven export of juveniles from estuary nursery 
  beds. </p>
<p>Post hoc analyses (Smith, 1996) of a dramatic decline in the late 1980s in 
  the Australian gemfish fishery suggest a combination of fishery pressure and 
  poor recruitments as the cause. Recruitment appears to correlate with climatic 
  cycles (Thresher, 1994). Smith (1996) developed a quantitative framework to 
  evaluate management strategies for this and other fisheries. </p>
<p>For New Zealand, there is some evidence that fisheries recruitment may be enhanced 
  by more frequent ENSO events (Harris <i>et al.</i>, 1988), although possible negative 
  effects of increased incidence of toxic algal blooms also have been observed 
  (Chang <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Changes in ENSO and ocean variability may combine with 
  ocean warming in ways that are poorly understood. Recent New Zealand studies 
  on snapper (Francis 1993, 1994a; Francis <i>et al.</i>, 1997), gemfish (Renwick et 
  al., 1998a), and hoki have shown that climatic variations may have a significant 
  impact on spawning success or failure and subsequent recruitment into marine 
  fish populations. Growth rates of juvenile and adult snapper appear to increase 
  when SSTs are warmer (Francis, 1994b). This may have significant effects on 
  the timing and scale of recruitment (e.g., Francis <i>et al.</i>, 1997). El Ni&ntilde;o 
  appears to have resulted in a westward shift of Chilean jack mackerel in the 
  Pacific and subsequent invasion of this species into New Zealand waters in the 
  mid-1980s (Elizarov <i>et al.</i>, 1993). This species now dominates the jack mackerel 
  fishery in many areas. Variations in the abundance and distribution of pelagic 
  large gamefish species in New Zealand may be closely correlated with variability 
  in the ocean climate, with implications for recreational fishers as well as 
  the tourist industry operating from charter boats.</p>
<p>Environmental temperature has a major influence on the population genetics of 
  cold-blooded animals, selecting for temperature-sensitive alleles and genotypes. 
  In New Zealand snapper, differences in allele frequencies at one enzyme marker 
  have been found among year classes from warm and cold summers (Smith, 1979). 
  Such differences could impact survival, growth rates, and reproductive success.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that, if the wildcard of possible reduction or 
  cessation of North Atlantic or Antarctic bottomwater formation were to occur 
  (Manabe and Stouffer, 1994; Hirst, 1999), this could lead to significant changes 
  in deep ocean chemistry, ocean dynamics, and nutrient levels on century time 
  scales. This could have wide, but presently unknown, ramifications for fisheries 
  in Australian and New Zealand waters. </p>
