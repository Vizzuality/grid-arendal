<h3>13.1.3. Recent Climate Variability in Europe, including Recent Warming </h3>
<p>The climate of Europe exhibits large differences from west (maritime) to east 
  (continental) and from north (Arctic) to south (Mediterranean). The climatic 
  effects of the distribution of land and ocean are further complicated by numerous 
  high mountain ranges, which act as physical barriers to atmospheric circulation 
  and often introduce large precipitation gradients within small regions (e.g., 
  Frei and Schär, 1998). There is no synoptic consistency to the behavior of the 
  European atmosphere across such a heterogeneous climatic domain. </p>
<p>Europe possesses long instrumental data records. The central England temperature 
  series, for example, commences in 1659 (Jones and Hulme, 1997). Reconstruction 
  of regional climates in Europe with proxy data sets identifies the magnitudes 
  of natural temperature variability that have occurred on even longer multi-century 
  time scales: 1,400 years of summer temperatures from tree growth in Fennoscandia 
  (Briffa et al., 1990), 460 years of monthly temperature and precipitation patterns 
  from hydrological and biological evidence in central Europe (Pfister, 1992), 
  and 500 years of annual temperatures from ice cores in Greenland (Fischer et 
  al., 1998). Direct sea-level measurements are available from the 18th century. 
  There have been several attempts at deciphering the remote past, based on proxy 
  data (e.g., Velichko et al., 1998; Zelikson et al., 1998). </p>
<h4><a name="13131"></a>13.1.3.1. Temperature </h4>
<p>Most of Europe has experienced increases in surface air temperature during 
  the 20th century that, averaged across the continent, amount to about 0.8°C 
  in annual temperature (see <a href="#fig131">Figure 13-1</a>) (ECSN, 1995; Beniston 
  et al., 1998; EEA, 1998). This warming has been largest over northwestern Russia 
  and the Iberian peninsula (Nicholls et al., 1996; Onate and Pou, 1996) and stronger 
  in winter than in summer (Maugeri and Nanni, 1998; Brunetti et al., 2000). An 
  exception is Fennoscandia, which has recorded cooling in mean maximum and mean 
  minimum temperature during 1910-1995 in winter but warming in summer (Tuomenvirta 
  et al., 1998). The past decade in Europe (1990-1999) has been the warmest in 
  the instrumental record, annually and for winter. Increases in growing-season 
  length also have been observed in Europe-for example, in western Russia (Jones 
  and Briffa, 1995) and in Fennoscandia (Carter, 1998). Trends in the intensity 
  of the growing season as measured by growing degree days, however, are more 
  ambiguous in both of these studies. The evidence for longer growing seasons 
  in Europe also is supported by phenological data collected in central Europe 
  (Menzel and Fabian, 1999). These data point to increases of about 10 days in 
  average growing-season length since the early 1960s. Other biological indicators 
  of a changing growing season in Europe include poleward shifts of 35-240 km 
  during this century in entire ranges of 34 different butterfly species (Parmesan 
  et al., 1999) and earlier breeding times for several species of amphibians and 
  migratory birds during the past few decades (Forchhammer et al., 1997).<br>

<a name="fig131"></a>Warming in annual mean temperature has occurred preferentially 
as a result of nighttime rather than daytime temperature increases (Brazdil et 
al., 1996; Easterling et al., 1997; Tuomenvirta et al., 1998), reflecting similar 
tendencies to those in other world regions. There has been some evidence that 
this reduction in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) has been associated with 
increased cloudiness. This is especially true over parts of the former Soviet 
Union (FSU-Abakumova et al., 1996; Groisman et al., 1996), Fennoscandia (Kaas 
and Frich, 1995; Tuomenvirta et al., 1998), and Switzerland, where Rebetez and 
Beniston (1998) found that a 20th-century decrease in DTR of about 1.5°C was strongly 
correlated with increased cloudiness, except at high elevations. In Italy (Brunetti 
et al., 2000), daytime warming is higher than nighttime temperature rise, with 
a consequent increase in DTR. 
<h4><a name="13132"></a>13.1.3.2. Precipitation </h4>
<p>Trends in annual precipitation differ between northern Europe (wetting) and 
  southern Europe (drying), reflecting a wider hemispheric pattern of contrasting 
  zonal-mean precipitation trends between high and low latitudes (Dai et al., 
  1997; Hulme et al., 1998). Precipitation over northern Europe has increased 
  by 10-40% in the 20th century, whereas some parts of southern Europe have dried 
  by as much as 20% (see <a href="#fig132">Figure 13-2</a>). Romero et al. (1999) 
  show that the numbers of days with precipitation over the Spanish southern coast 
  and the Pyrenees region have decreased by 50 and 30%, respectively, in 1964-1993. 
  In Italy, total precipitation in the 20th century has decreased by about 5% 
  in the north and by about 15% in the south (Buffoni et al., 1999; Brunetti et 
  al., 2001). Analysis of moisture extremes over Europe, using the Palmer Drought 
  Severity Index (PDSI-Briffa et al., 1994) showed strong decadal-scale variability 
  in drought frequency; the 1940s and early 1950s experienced widespread and severe 
  droughts-a pattern repeated in 1989 and 1990. </p>
<h4><a name="13133"></a>13.1.3.3. Extreme Events </h4>
<p>Analyses of trends in extreme weather events in Europe generally have been 
  limited to national studies, making it difficult to provide a continent-wide 
  overview of changes in hot/cold day frequencies, precipitation intensities, 
  or gale frequencies. Gruza et al. (1999) analyzed data over the whole of Russia, 
  the western third of which falls into our definition of Europe, and found a 
  slight increase over the 20th century in the Climate Extremes Index (CEI), which 
  combines daily temperature, daily precipitation, and drought extremes. Analysis 
  of 85 long-term maximum 1-day precipitation records in the Nordic countries 
  indicates that there is a maximum in the 1930s and a tendency of increasing 
  values during the 1980s and 1990s-decades with relatively high regional summer 
  temperatures. In western Norway, the past 2 decades have been exceptional, with 
  substantial increases in orographic precipitation during autumn, winter, and 
  spring (Førland et al., 1998). Elsewhere, daily precipitation intensities over 
  the UK have increased in winter over recent decades (Osborn et al., 1999), although 
  not in other seasons. This increase in UK winter precipitation intensities has 
  been paralleled by a marked decrease in the frequency of cold winter days in 
  the UK (Jones et al., 1999). Changes in storminess over the northeast Atlantic 
  have been analyzed by Schmidt et al. (1998) and WASA (1998); they show that 
  although storminess has increased in recent decades, storm intensities are no 
  higher than they were early in the 20th century. Wave heights around the shores 
  of northwest Europe also show large decadal variability, but no long-term trends 
  emerge. </p>
<h4><a name="13134"></a>13.1.3.4. North Atlantic Oscillation </h4>
<p> One important cause for interannual and perhaps interdecadal climate variability 
  in Europe, particularly in winter, is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). 
  NAO is a measure of the strength of the westerly flow over the North Atlantic; 
  records go back to the early 19th century (Jones et al., 1997). Over the past 
  4 decades, the NAO pattern gradually has altered from the most extreme and persistent 
  negative phase in the 1960s to the most extreme positive phase during the late 
  1980s and early 1990s-a trend that has been responsible for relatively mild 
  and wet winters during the latter period over much of northwest Europe (Hurrell 
  and van Loon, 1997) and can help explain the observed narrowing in DTR (Tuomenvirta 
  et al., 1998). Following its long period of amplification, the NAO index underwent 
  a sharp decrease to a short-lived minimum in the winter of 1995-1996, with radical 
  recognizable changes in the North Atlantic. It should be noted that the NAO 
  appears to exert significant control on the export of ice and freshwater from 
  the Arctic to the open Atlantic (WCRP, 1998). Since that temporary minimum, 
  a recovery toward positive values of the NAO has been observed. NAO certainly 
  is a more important influence on European climate than the El Niño-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO), although several studies have explored the influence of 
  ENSO on European precipitation variability, and links between NAO and ENSO are 
  being sought. Evidence for such an influence is weak and shows phase differences 
  through the continent (Fraedrich and Müller, 1992; Fraedrich et al., 1992; Rodo 
  et al., 1997; Price et al., 1998). </p>
<h3><a name="1314"></a>13.1.4. Key Sensitivities to Climate and Weather Now </h3>
<p>The response of human activities and the natural environment to current weather 
  perturbations provides a guide to where critical sensitivities to future climate 
  change may lie. Even if adaptation may modify the response, analysis of present-day 
  sensitivities helps us understand the likely impact of future climate changes 
  on our environment and lifestyle. </p>
<p>The principal sensitivities in Europe to current climate and weather conditions 
  are to: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Extreme seasons - Exceptionally hot, dry summers - Mild winters 
  <li> Short-duration hazards - Windstorm (possibly associated with tidal surges) 
    - Heavy rain leading to river-valley flooding and flash floods 
  <li> Slow, long-term change - Coastal squeeze. 
</ul>
<p>Sensitivities vary across Europe as a result of differences in climate and 
  topography, as well as the socioeconomic environment, but all of Europe is sensitive 
  to the foregoing anomalous conditions. </p>
<h4><a name="13141"></a>13.1.4.1. Extreme Seasons </h4>
<h4><a name="131411"></a>13.1.4.1.1. Exceptionally hot, dry summers </h4>
<p>Extremely hot and dry summers were experienced in 1995 throughout much of western 
  Europe (Palutikof et al., 1997) and in 1992 in CEE (Schellnhuber et al., 1994). 
  Summer drought conditions can have a devastating impact on the natural environment, 
  particularly by reducing the availability of water for flora and fauna. Pollution 
  levels may rise to high levels in the subsiding anticyclonic air, with add-on 
  effects for human health in terms of increased numbers of asthma attacks and 
  associated hospitalizations. High water temperatures often lead to algal blooms, 
  which may make water bodies unusable for recreational purposes. </p>

</table>
<p><a name="fig132"></a>Agriculture and water supply are the two economic sectors 
  that may be most severely affected by exceptional heat and drought in summer. 
  Large proportions of the working populations in Mediterranean countries are 
  engaged in agriculture, and even in "normal" years water shortages may be a 
  limiting factor. These countries, therefore, appear to be more vulnerable to 
  exceptional summer weather. An increased frequency of hot, dry summers is likely 
  to reduce tree growth and affect timber yield and quality. Reduced tree vigor 
  often favors outbreaks of pests and pathogens, and hot and dry conditions trigger 
  wildfire. </p>
<h4><a name="131412"></a>13.1.4.1.2. Mild winters </h4>
<p>Milder winters exert a major impact on the natural environment. Overwintering 
  of species is more successful. However, failure to kill off pests and diseases 
  that prey on wildlife, as well as failure to cull weaker members of the species&#151;which 
  then compete for food in the following springs and summers&#151;in the end may 
  be counterproductive. Cannell and Pitcairn (1993) show that during two mild 
  winters in the UK, various life events occurred earlier&#151;for example, insects 
  and other animals moved about and fed more actively, causing widespread aphid 
  damage on oak and mite damage on lime. Milder winters can affect fulfillment 
  of chilling requirements in some plant species, which would have an impact on 
  the formation of leaf and flower buds (e.g., Murray et al., 1989). This could 
  lead to regeneration failure; some susceptible species are common across much 
  of Europe today (e.g., Picea abies) (Sykes and Prentice, 1996).</p>
<p>The skiing industry in Europe is vulnerable to variations in snowfall-that 
  is, too little or too much snow. Many European ski resorts have suffered severe 
  shortfalls in earnings when snow cover was not sufficiently deep during Christmas 
  and winter school holidays. If temperatures remain below freezing, a more active 
  hydrological cycle might lead to more episodes of heavy snowfall; the winter 
  of 1998-1999 is a good proxy for this situation. Although the number of cold 
  spells generally has decreased over the past few decades, cold spells still 
  have a range of impacts on agriculture, settlements, the built environment, 
  and transport. </p>
<h4><a name="13142"></a>13.1.4.2. Short-Duration Hazards </h4>
<p>Severe windstorms affected Europe in the 1990s. The January 1990 storm (Daria) 
  caused insured losses of about US$5.7 billion (at 1997 prices) and 95 deaths; 
  in the following month, the storm of 26 February (Vivian) caused a further US$3.9 
  billion in insured losses (Swiss Re, 1998) and 64 deaths. The UK experienced 
  a severe windstorm at Christmas 1997, causing 13 deaths and losses of US$500 
  million (Swiss Re, 1998). </p>
<p>The major impact of windstorm on the natural environment is on trees, woodland, 
  and forest. It is estimated that 15 million trees (5 months' production of coniferous 
  wood and 2 years' production of broadleaf timber production-see Quine, 1988) 
  were blown down in the UK during the October 1987 storm. </p>
<p>Windstorm associated with tidal surge is a particularly deadly combination 
  for low-lying coastal areas, as epitomized by the event of 1953. Severe northerly 
  winds combined with an exceptionally high spring tide caused overtopping in 
  The Netherlands and much of East Anglia, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths. 
  Since then the policy has been to keep the sea out at all costs, and in fact 
  several storm surges of similar size have occurred with no loss of life. </p>
<p>Several devastating river floods, of high severity, occurred in Europe in the 
  1990s (Kundzewicz and Takeuchi, 1999). Among the flood events to hit the headlines 
  was the Odra flood in the summer of 1997, during which historic flow records 
  were broken. The deluge caused more than 100 deaths and economic damage in excess 
  of US$5 billion (Kundzewicz et al., 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="13143"></a>13.1.4.3. Coastal Squeeze </h4>
<p>Coastal squeeze occurs when coastal habitats are "squeezed" between rising 
  sea level and fixed hard defenses (Bijlsma et al., 1996). It is occurring in 
  most northwest European countries, and it already is a coastal management issue 
  (Rigg et al., 1997). It is considered in more detail in <a href="499.htm">Sections 
  13.2.1.3</a> and <a href="511.htm">13.3.5</a>.</p>
