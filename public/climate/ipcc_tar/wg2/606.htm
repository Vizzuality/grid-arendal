<h4><a name="16242"></a>16.2.4.2. Sea Ice in the Southern Ocean</h4>
<p>Antarctic sea ice is not confined by land margins but is open to the Southern 
  Ocean. Sea-ice extent contracts and expands on an annual cycle in a roughly 
  concentric zone around Antarctica. The ultimate extent is controlled by a balance 
  of air temperature, leads, wind direction, upper ocean structure, and pycnocline 
  depth. Some of these parameters are controlled in the atmosphere by the relative 
  position of the subpolar trough with respect to the sea ice. In the ocean, variations 
  in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are important. The extent and thickness 
  of Antarctic sea ice are sensitive to the depth and thermal properties of overlying 
  snow, about which relatively little is known.</p>
<p>A reduction in Antarctic sea ice volume of about 25-45% is predicted for 
  a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, with sea ice retreating fairly evenly around the 
  continent (Gordon and O'Farrell, 1997). This CSIRO model assumes a 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  compounding increase of CO<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to global warming of 2.1&deg;C. 
  Using a similar but modified model that has a higher albedo feedback and predicted 
  global warming of 2.8&deg;C, Wu <i>et al</i>. (1999) calculate a reduction in 
  mean sea-ice extent of nearly two degrees of latitude, corresponding to 45% 
  of sea-ice volume. These estimates do not represent the equilibrium state, and 
  sea ice can be expected to shrink further, even if GHGs are stabilized. Changes 
  in Antarctic sea ice will have little impact on human activity except where 
  they allow shipping (mostly research, fishing, and tourist vessels) to get closer 
  to the Antarctic continent. However, there are important biological and oceanographic 
  impacts derived from reductions in sea ice, as well as significant ecological 
  consequences attributable to changes in the magnitude and timing of seasonal 
  sea-ice advance and retreat (Smith <i>et al</i>., 1999b).</p>
<h3><a name="1625"></a>16.2.5. Permafrost </h3>
<p>The term permafrost refers to layers of earth materials at relatively shallow 
  depth that remain below 0&deg;C throughout 2 or more consecutive years, independent 
  of material composition or ice content. The role of permafrost in the context 
  of global change is three-fold (Nelson <i>et al</i>., 1993): It records temperature 
  changes (Lachenbruch and Marshall, 1986), translates changes to other components 
  of the environment (Osterkamp <i>et al</i>., 2000), and facilitates further climatic 
  changes through release of trace gases (Rivkin, 1998; Robinson and Moore, 1999). 
  Permafrost is highly susceptible to long-term warming. Although it is an important 
  factor in ice-free parts of Antarctica (Bockheim, 1995), permafrost is far more 
  extensive in the continental areas of the subarctic and Arctic (Brown <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Zhang <i>et al</i>., 1999), and changes there have great potential to affect 
  human activities adversely. Accordingly, frozen ground activity has been designated 
  as a "geoindicator" for monitoring and assessing environmental change 
  (Berger and Iams, 1996).<br>
</p>
<p>Most biological and hydrological processes in permafrost terrain are confined 
  to the active (seasonally thawed) layer, which forms a boundary across which 
  exchanges of heat, moisture, and gases occur between the atmospheric and terrestrial 
  systems. Its thickness is a response to a complex interplay among several factors, 
  including aboveground climate, vegetation type and density, snow-cover properties, 
  thermal properties of the substrate, and moisture content. If other conditions 
  remain constant, the thickness of the active layer could be expected to increase 
  in response to climate warming. Long-term records of active-layer thickness 
  are rare; those that do exist, however, indicate that variations occur at multiple 
  temporal scales and are determined by climatic trends and local conditions at 
  the surface and in the substrate (Nelson <i>et al</i>., 1998b).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16251"></a>16.2.5.1. Temperature Archive </h4>
<p>Because heat transfer within thick permafrost occurs primarily by conduction, 
  the shallow earth acts as a low-pass filter and "remembers" past temperatures. 
  Temperature trends are recorded in the temperature-depth profile over time scales 
  of a century or more (e.g., Lachenbruch and Marshall, 1986; Clow <i>et al</i>., 1998; 
  Osterkamp <i>et al</i>., 1998; Taylor and Burgess, 1998). Permafrost is affected primarily 
  by long-term temperature changes and thus contains a valuable archive of climate 
  change (Lachenbruch and Marshall, 1986), although changes in snow cover must 
  be taken into account. In contrast, the temperature regime of the overlying 
  seasonally thawed active layer is highly complex, owing to nonconductive heat-transfer 
  processes that operate much of the year (Hinkel <i>et al</i>., 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Multi-decadal increases in permafrost temperature have been reported from many 
  locations in the Arctic, including northern and central Alaska (Lachenbruch 
  and Marshall, 1986; Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999), northwestern Canada (Majoriwicz 
  and Skinner, 1997), and Siberia (Pavlov, 1996). Temperature increases are not 
  uniform, however, and recent cooling of permafrost has been reported in northern 
  Quebec (Wang and Allard, 1995). To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the 
  spatial structure and variability of long-term changes in permafrost, the Global 
  Terrestrial Network for Permafrost or (GTNet-P) (Brown <i>et al</i>., 2000; 
  Burgess <i>et al</i>., 2000b) was developed in the 1990s. The program has two 
  components: long-term monitoring of the thermal state of permafrost in a network 
  of boreholes, and monitoring of active-layer thickness and processes at representative 
  locations. The latter network&#151;the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) 
  program (Nelson and Brown, 1997)&#151;has been in operation since the mid-1990s 
  and incorporates more than 80 stations in the Arctic and Antarctic. The CALM 
  network includes components in which regional mapping (Nelson <i>et al</i>., 
  1999) and spatial time series analysis of active-layer thickness (Nelson <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998a) are performed.</p>
