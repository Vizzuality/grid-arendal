<h4><a name="15328"></a>15.3.2.8. Arctic Border </h4>
<p>A case study of the regional impacts of climate change scenarios has been completed 
  in the Mackenzie basin, a watershed that extends from the mid-latitudes to the 
  subarctic in northwest Canada. A lengthy description of this case study, known 
  as the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study, is available in Cohen (1994, 1996, 1997a,b,c). 
  A sketch of the MBIS integrating framework is shown in <a href="583.htm#fig1510">Figure 
  15-10</a>. Within this process, several types of integration exercises were 
  used, including models, stakeholder consultation, and thematic discussions. 
</p>
<p>As a high-latitude watershed, the Mackenzie basin has been regarded as an area 
  that might benefit in certain ways from a warmer climate. Taken individually, 
  economic impacts could be quantified, and these impacts might show substantial 
  benefits for the region. Other factors must be considered, however, and some 
  of these factors may constrain the potential benefits: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The current system of land transportation, much of which is based on a stable 
    ice and snow cover for winter roads</li>
  <li>Current ranges and habitats of wildlife, which underpin conservation plans 
    and native land claims </li>
  <li>Scientific uncertainty, which hampers anticipatory responses to projected 
    beneficial conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential negative impacts of climate warming also must be considered because 
  they may offset possible benefits. An example is the implication of hydrological 
  and landscape changes on water management agreements. Initial projections of 
  runoff and lake levels are for declines below observed minima (Soulis <i>et 
  al</i>., 1994; Kerr, 1997). Peace River ice cover will be affected by temperature 
  changes and changes in outflow from the Bennett Dam in northeast British Columbia 
  (Andres, 1994). There continue to be uncertainties in projections of hydrological 
  impacts; the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is addressing 
  these uncertainties (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 16</a>). There has been a 
  strong warming trend in the region during the past 40 years, and Great Slave 
  Lake experienced new record minimum lake levels in 1995.</p>
<p>It would appear that the other main threats to the Mackenzie landscape are 
  accelerated erosion and landslides caused by permafrost thaw and extreme events 
  (fire, storm surges), especially in sloping terrain and the Beaufort Sea coastal 
  zone (Aylsworth and Egginton, 1994; Solomon, 1994; Aylsworth and Duk-Rodkin, 
  1997; Dyke <i>et al</i>., 1997); increased fire hazard (Hartley and Marshall, 
  1997; Kadonaga, 1997); changes in climate conditions that influence the development 
  of peatlands (Nicholson <i>et al</i>., 1996, 1997; Gignac <i>et al</i>., 1998); 
  and invasion of new pests and diseases from warmer regions (Sieben <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). </p>
<p>Impacts on fisheries and wildlife are difficult to project, as a result of 
  lack of long-term data, complexity of life cycles, and incomplete information 
  on responses to previous environmental changes (Brotton and Wall, 1997; Gratto-Trevor, 
  1997; Latour and MacLean, 1997; Maarouf and Boyd, 1997; Melville, 1997). Outside 
  of MBIS, there have been few impact studies on North American boreal and Arctic 
  freshwater fisheries (Weatherhead and Morseth, 1998). Some information is available 
  on terrestrial wildlife and Arctic marine fisheries (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 
  16</a>). Others have outlined the potential for freshwater ecosystem impacts, 
  including loss or reduction of deltaic lakes, increased pondwater temperatures, 
  side effects of permafrost thaw (including sedimentation of rivers), and changes 
  in primary productivity depending on nutrient levels (Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1997; 
  Schindler <i>et al</i>., 1997; Meyer <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>First-order and second-order impacts eventually lead to others that are considerably 
  more difficult to address. Will land claims or water resources agreements be 
  affected? Would it be appropriate to artificially maintain historic water levels 
  in the Peace-Athabasca delta within this scenario of climate change (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 
  16</a>)? Could there be new conflicts over land use, especially if agriculture 
  expands northward to take advantage of improved soil capability to support crop 
  production (Brklacich <i>et al</i>., 1996, 1997b)? What might be the effects 
  on parks and other protected areas (Pollard and Benton, 1994) and tourism (Staple 
  and Wall, 1996; Brotton and Wall, 1997; Brotton <i>et al</i>., 1997; Wall, 1998a,b)? 
  Could climate change affect the economics of commercial forestry (Rothman and 
  Herbert, 1997) or oil and gas production in the Beaufort Sea (Anderson and DiFrancesco, 
  1997)? </p>
<p>Two exercises dealt with individual perceptions of aboriginal responses to 
  future scenarios. The first asked for a listing of physical and biological impacts, 
  as well as how aboriginal people would be affected if they continued to pursue 
  a traditional aboriginal lifestyle or if they became more active in the formal 
  wage economy (similar to the dual-economy situation described by Shukla, 1997). 
  Results showed that perceptions of impact and vulnerability were influenced 
  by visions of future lifestyles (Aharonian, 1994). The second exercise used 
  input-output modeling and a community survey to look at responses to a potential 
  benefit of warming&#151;an opportunity for expanded activity in the formal wage 
  economy (because of the longer summer) that would force people to relocate from 
  their traditional community if they wanted the employment. Results showed a 
  willingness to accept the opportunity, but there were concerns about social 
  impacts on the community of relocation or creation of commuter workers who would 
  be absent for extended periods (Lonergan and Kavanagh, 1997).</p>
