<h3>1.4.4. Synergies and Tradeoffs </h3>
<h4><a name="1441"></a>1.4.4.1. Synergies and Tradeoffs between Climate Change 
  and Other Environmental Issues </h4>
<p>Climate change is only one issue among many. The early stages of economic development 
  typically lead to an increase in many pollutants, and actions taken to reduce 
  one can have ancillary benefits caused by simultaneous reduction of others. 
  Assessments that neglect these synergies can seriously underestimate the justification 
  for cutbacks. On the other hand, impacts from climate change can depend on the 
  levels of other pollutants. For example, forests weakened by acid rain are likely 
  to be more vulnerable to changes in rainfall brought on by climate change or 
  warming, and lake acidification can have a synergy with ultraviolet radiation 
  penetration into the water (e.g., Schindler et al., 1996). While maintaining 
  its primary focus on decadal to centennial-scale climate change, Working Group 
  II has examined linkages among climate change and other environmental issues, 
  including climate variability, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and desertification. 
</p>
<h4><a name="1442"></a>1.4.4.2. Synergies and Tradeoffs between Adaptation and 
  Mitigation </h4>
<p>It is often argued in the literature that there is a tradeoff between adaptation 
  and mitigation in that resources committed to one are not available for the 
  other. This is debatable in practice because the people who bear emission reduction 
  costs or benefits often are different from those who pay for and benefit from 
  adaptation measures. Arguments are given on both sides of this issue. On one 
  hand, in a straight comparison, several factors point to the wisdom of initially 
  committing resources to adaptation. Insofar as no level of mitigation will completely 
  prevent some climate change, some adaptation will be necessary. The benefits 
  from adaptation are received in the country that incurs the costs, so there 
  is no "free-rider" problem; climate change from GHG emissions that already have 
  occurred means that adaptation will be required even if quite stringent mitigation 
  also is agreed on; many adaptation options, such as switching agricultural crops 
  and strengthening seawalls, are relatively cheap options for some (but not all-e.g., 
  for small island states), and there may be ancillary benefits of the adaptation 
  action even if climatic change effects turn out to be small (e.g., "no regrets" 
  policies such as improving the efficiency of irrigation equipment). </p>
<p>On the other hand, it has been argued that climatic changes today still are 
  relatively small, thus there is little need for adaptation, although there is 
  considerable need for mitigation to avoid more severe future damages. By this 
  logic, it is more prudent to invest the bulk of the resources for climate policy 
  in mitigation, rather than adaptation. </p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that many adaptation options will be pursued. This 
  means that the baseline against which mitigation options should be assessed 
  is one with adaptation also occurring. If the adaptations were effective in 
  reducing the costs of climatic impacts, this can significantly reduce the benefits 
  that otherwise would have been attributable to mitigation. On the other hand, 
  as <a href="060.htm#141">Section 1.4.1</a> notes, lack of perfect foresight 
  about future climatic or other relevant social trends can lead to maladaptations. 
  This situation would then argue for more emphasis on mitigation because maladaptations 
  in the future would increase the costs of climatic impacts thus justify stronger 
  abatement efforts. Furthermore, it has been argued that early steps toward mitigation 
  can lower long-term costs of carbon abatement by reducing the rate at which 
  the energy-intensive capital stock has to be turned over, by inducing research 
  and development, and/or by enhancing learning by doing (Grubb et al., 1994; 
  Azar, 1998; Goulder and Schneider, 1999). Others have argued that delayed abatement 
  is more cost-effective because the bulk of the climate damages are likely to 
  occur in the future, whereas the costs of immediate abatement occur in the nearer 
  term; thus, discounting reduces the present value of the benefits of avoided 
  climate damage versus less discounted abatement costs (e.g., Wigley et al., 
  1996). Working Group III explores these issues in more depth, but in the context 
  of the Working Group II mandate it must be recognized that many factors that 
  still contain considerable uncertainty enter the debate about tradeoffs between 
  timing and magnitudes of adaptation and mitigation efforts. </p>
<h3><a name="145"></a>1.4.5. Integrated Assessment </h3>
<p>Given the multi-sectoral, multi-regional, multidisciplinary, and multi-institutional 
  nature of the integration of climatic change assessments of effects, impacts, 
  and policy options, methods to perform "end-to-end" analyses have been developed 
  and often are labeled "integrated assessments" (see, e.g., Weyant et al., 1996; 
  Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 1996, and references therein). Integrated assessment 
  models (IAMs) have been developed to provide the logical consequences of a variety 
  of explicit assumptions that undergird any formal assessment technique. IAMs 
  seek to combine knowledge from several disciplines that is relevant to climate 
  change in mathematical representations of the determinants of GHG emissions, 
  responses of the climate system and feedbacks to emissions, effects on socioeconomic 
  activities and ecosystems, and potential policies and responses (Parson and 
  Fisher-Vanden, 1997). To date, IAMs have relied primarily on highly aggregated 
  representations that directly link monetized measures of projected impacts to 
  mean climate variables-principally, annual global mean temperature. Over time, 
  these sorts of estimates have been extended by introducing variation between 
  regions, by separating market and nonmarket damages, or by introducing other 
  climate variables such as precipitation (Parson and Fisher-Vanden, 1997). A 
  few IAMs adopt a process-based, geographically explicit approach to modeling, 
  thus have more detailed representation of impacts, often including changes in 
  physical units (e.g., crop yields) as measures of impact. These models do not 
  translate impacts into a common metric, such as money. This makes comparing 
  the level of impacts depicted in the two different modeling approaches very 
  difficult (Tol and Fankhauser, 1998). </p>
<p>IAMs have evolved from a variety of disciplinary tools that often were developed 
  for purposes other than assessments of climatic changes. IAMs have been classified 
  into a hierarchy of five levels (Schneider, 1997). This classification scheme 
  does not imply that each successive level of modeling along the hierarchy (see 
  <a href="089.htm">Section 2.3.8</a>) incorporates all of the elements at lower 
  levels or that incorporation of additional levels of comprehensiveness or complexity 
  provides more fidelity in the model's simulation skills; that depends on the 
  validity of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of methods used to formally 
  solve the equations that represent those assumptions. Finally, difficulties 
  are encountered in aggregating costs or benefits across the many categories 
  of impacts or opportunities, and a traceable account of any aggregations must 
  be paramount to maintain transparency of any analytic methods such as IAMs (see 
  <a href="064.htm#156">Sections 1.5.6</a> and <a href="108.htm">2.6.4</a>). </p>
<p>Despite these complexities, IAMs are a principal tool for studying systematic 
  sets of interactions that are believed to be important in explaining systems 
  behavior or simulating the consequences of various policies on the magnitude 
  and distribution of risks and benefits of climatic changes or policies to enhance 
  adaptation or encourage mitigation. The goal of IAMs has been to provide insights 
  about the possible interactions of many factors in a complex socionatural system, 
  rather than "answers" to specific scientific or policy questions. </p>
