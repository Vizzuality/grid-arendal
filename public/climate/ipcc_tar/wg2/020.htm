<h2>5. Improving Assessments of Impacts, Vulnerabilities, and Adaptation</h2>
<p>Advances have been made since previous IPCC assessments in the detection of 
  change in biotic and physical systems, and steps have been taken to improve 
  the understanding of adaptive capacity, vulnerability to climate extremes, and 
  other critical impact- related issues. These advances indicate a need for initiatives 
  to begin designing adaptation strategies and building adaptive capacities. Further 
  research is required, however, to strengthen future assessments and to reduce 
  uncertainties in order to assure that sufficient information is available for 
  policymaking about responses to possible consequences of climate change, including 
  research in and by developing countries. [<a href="053.htm">8</a>]</p>
<p>The following are high priorities for narrowing gaps between current knowledge 
  and policymaking needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quantitative assessment of the sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability 
    of natural and human systems to climate change, with particular emphasis on 
    changes in the range of climatic variation and the frequency and severity 
    of extreme climate events<br>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of possible thresholds at which strongly discontinuous responses 
    to projected climate change and other stimuli would be triggered<br>
  </li>
  <li>Understanding dynamic responses of ecosystems to multiple stresses, including 
    climate change, at global, regional, and finer scales<br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of approaches to adaptation responses, estimation of the effectiveness 
    and costs of adaptation options, and identification of differences in opportunities 
    for and obstacles to adaptation in different regions, nations, and populations<br>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of potential impacts of the full range of projected climate changes, 
    particularly for non-market goods and services, in multiple metrics and with 
    consistent treatment of uncertainties, including but not limited to numbers 
    of people affected, land area affected, numbers of species at risk, monetary 
    value of impact, and implications in these regards of different stabilization 
    levels and other policy scenarios<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improving tools for integrated assessment, including risk assessment, to 
    investigate interactions between components of natural and human systems and 
    the consequences of different policy decisions<br>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of opportunities to include scientific information on impacts, 
    vulnerability, and adaptation in decisionmaking processes, risk management, 
    and sustainable development initiatives<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improvement of systems and methods for long-term monitoring and understanding 
    the consequences of climate change and other stresses on human and natural 
    systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cutting across these foci are special needs associated with strengthening international 
  cooperation and coordination for regional assessment of impacts, vulnerability, 
  and adaptation, including capacity-building and training for monitoring, assessment, 
  and data gathering, especially in and for developing countries (particularly 
  in relation to the items identified above).</p>
