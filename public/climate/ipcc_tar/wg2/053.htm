<h1>8. Information Needs </h1>
<p>Although progress has been made, considerable gaps in knowledge remain regarding 
  exposure, sensitivity, adaptability, and vulnerability of physical, ecological, 
  and social systems to climate change. Advances in these areas are priorities 
  for advancing understanding of potential consequences of climate change for 
  human society and the natural world, as well as to support analyses of possible 
  responses.</p>
<p><i>Exposure.</i> Advances in methods for projecting exposures to climate stimuli 
  and other nonclimate stresses at finer spatial scales are needed to improve 
  understanding of potential consequences of climate change, including regional 
  differences, and stimuli to which systems may need to adapt. Work in this area 
  should draw on results from research on system sensitivity, adaptability, and 
  vulnerability to identify the types of climate stimuli and nonclimate stresses 
  that affect systems most. This research is particularly needed in developing 
  countries, many of which lack historical data, adequate monitoring systems, 
  and research and development capabilities. Developing local capacity in environmental 
  assessment and management will increase investment effectiveness. Methods of 
  investigating possible changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate 
  events, climate variability, and large-scale, abrupt changes in the Earth system 
  such as slowing or shutdown of thermohaline circulation of oceans are priorities. 
  Work also is needed to advance understanding of how social and economic factors 
  influence the exposures of different populations.</p>
<p><i>Sensitivity.</i> Sensitivity to climate stimuli is still poorly quantified 
  for many natural and human systems. Responses of systems to climate change are 
  expected to include strong nonlinearities, discontinuous or abrupt responses, 
  time-varying responses, and complex interactions with other systems. However, 
  quantification of the curvature, thresholds, and interactions of system responses 
  is poorly developed for many systems. Work is needed to develop and improve 
  process-based, dynamic models of natural, social, and economic systems; to estimate 
  model parameters of system responses to climate variables; and to validate model 
  simulation results. This work should include use of observational evidence, 
  paleo-observations where applicable, and long-term monitoring of systems and 
  forces acting on them. Continued efforts to detect impacts of observed climate 
  change is a priority for further investigation that can provide empirical information 
  for understanding of system sensitivity to climate change</p>
<p><i>Adaptability.</i> Progress has been made in the investigation of adaptive 
  measures and adaptive capacity. However, work is needed to better understand 
  the applicability of adaptation experiences with climate variability to climate 
  change, to use this information to develop empirically based estimates of the 
  effectiveness and costs of adaptation, and to develop predictive models of adaptive 
  behavior that take into account decision making under uncertainty. Work also 
  is needed to better understand the determinants of adaptive capacity and to 
  use this information to advance understanding of differences in adaptive capacity 
  across regions, nations, and socioeconomic groups, as well as how capacity may 
  change through time. Advances in these areas are expected to be useful for identifying 
  successful strategies for enhancing adaptation capacity in ways that can be 
  complementary to climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and equity 
  goals.</p>
<p><i>Vulnerability.</i> Assessments of vulnerability to climate change are largely 
  qualitative and address the sources and character of vulnerability. Further 
  work is needed to integrate information about exposures, sensitivity, and adaptability 
  to provide more detailed and quantitative information about the potential impacts 
  of climate change and the relative degree of vulnerability of different regions, 
  nations, and socioeconomic groups. Advances will require development and refinement 
  of multiple measures or indices of vulnerability such as the number or percentage 
  of persons, species, systems or land area negatively or positively affected; 
  changes in productivity of systems; the monetary value of economic welfare change 
  in absolute and relative terms; and measures of distributional inequities.</p>
<p><i>Uncertainty.</i> Large gaps remain in refining and applying methods for 
  treating uncertainties, particularly with respect to providing scientific information 
  for decisionmaking. Improvements are required in ways of expressing the likelihood, 
  confidence, and range of uncertainty for estimates of outcomes, as well as how 
  such estimates fit into broader ranges of uncertainty. Methods for providing 
  "traceable accounts" of how any aggregated estimate is made from disaggregated 
  information must be refined. More effort is needed to translate judgments into 
  probability distributions in integrated assessment models.</p>
