<h4>11.2.2.2. Grain Supply and Demand in Asia</h4>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="right">

      1999). </td>

<p><a name="fig118"></a>Asia's total cereal production more than tripled 
  between 1961 and 1999, from 329.5 to nearly 1,025.8 Mt; the increase in harvest 
  area was only marginal (from 271.8 to 324.5 Mha) during this period. Rice paddy 
  production in Asia jumped from 198.7 to 533.5 Mt while the harvest area increased 
  from 106.9 Mha in 1961 to 136.5 Mha in 1999. Similarly, wheat production in 
  Asia increased from 45.8 to 261.7 Mt while the harvest area increased from 61.2 
  Mha in 1961 to 97.2 Mha in 1999. A three-fold increase in production of sugarcane 
  and almost five-fold increase in oil crops took place in Asia during 1961-1999. 
  Asian production of starchy roots also doubled during this period. Even as the 
  Asian population increased a little more than two-fold&#151;from 1.70 billion 
  to 3.58 billion people&#151;during this time, per capita consumption of calories 
  in Asia has increased since the 1960s (FAO, 1999a). This improvement in the 
  food situation has been the consequence of an increase in production, resulting 
  from technological advances, that has outpaced population growth in Asia. However, 
  because there is a limit to the amount of arable land, while the Asian population 
  continues to grow, the per capita area of harvest has consistently decreased. 
</p>
<p>The population growth rate has been a primary factor in the increase in demand 
  for food grains in Asia. Since the mid-1980s, rapid changes in food supply and 
  demand structures have been observed in most developing countries. Declines 
  in self-sufficiency for grains have been particularly dramatic in countries 
  with advanced economies, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (China), and Malaysia, 
  where the grain self-sufficiency rate has fallen below 30% in recent years. 
  The rapid decline in grain self-sufficiency in these countries is unprecedented 
  in any region of the world. Between 1970 and 1996, grain self-sufficiency fell 
  from 45 to 27% in Japan, from 68 to 31% in Korea, from 61 to 19% in Taiwan (China), 
  and from 60 to 25% in Malaysia (FAO, 1996). Declines in grain self-sufficiency 
  also have been observed in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Populous 
  countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan have long maintained 
  grain self-sufficiency of more than 90%, but as these countries shift to industrialization 
  it is possible that declines will be observed there as well. In contrast, Thailand 
  and Vietnam, which encompass the great grain-producing regions of the Menam 
  and Mekong River deltas, continue to maintain better than 100% self-sufficiency 
  for grains. </p>
<p>The annual per capita consumption of meat in principal Asian countries also 
  has shown an upward trend in recent years. Since the 1970s, South Korea and 
  China have reported the most rapid increases in meat consumption. In South Korea, 
  per capita meat consumption grew about seven-fold, from 5.2 to 40 kg between 
  1970 and 1997; in China, it increased nearly five-fold, from 8.8 to 42.5 kg. 
  During the same period, per capita meat consumption more than doubled in Japan 
  (42.2 kg in 1997) and Malaysia (51.9 kg in 1997). Meat consumption in Sri Lanka, 
  Bangladesh, and India grew only marginally, remaining below or at 5 kg even 
  in 1997&#151;considerably lower than the level in east Asia. The increasing 
  trend in meat consumption in temperate Asia means higher demand for livestock 
  feed for the production of meat. Demand for this feed in Asia increased from 
  25.2 Mt in the 1970s to 61.2 Mt in 1980, 147.0 Mt in 1990, and 163.0 Mt in 1999. 
  The demand for feed grain in Asia has grown at an annual rate of about 6.6% 
  and has been a principal factor in the rapid increase in demand for world grain 
  imports. </p>
<p>The world is moving toward a tighter grain supply and demand, and instability 
  in the world grain market is rising. At the same time, Asia is becoming increasingly 
  dependent on the world grain market. As shown in <a href="#fig118">Figure 11-8</a>, 
  net grain import in Asia was 20.3 Mt in 1961; it increased to 80.9 Mt by 1998. 
  The continuing increase in grain imports is a result of increasing populations 
  and increased demand for grain that accompanies economic growth, with which 
  increases in grain production within the region cannot keep pace. </p>
<p>The impact of global warming on the international supply and demand of rice 
  and wheat has been evaluated by Nakagawa et al. (1997) through the use of a 
  partial equilibrium-type dynamic model for world supply and demand. Based on 
  a world rice and wheat supply and demand model and a unit harvest scenario, 
  the study projected that the serious impacts of global warming would be felt 
  as early as the year 2020. The study suggests that the early impacts will not 
  be so severe that humans are unable to control them. However, the gap between 
  supply and demand may grow in some regions of Asia, resulting in considerably 
  increased reliance on imports. Furthermore, the problem of short-term fluctuations 
  in the market because of an increased frequency of droughts, floods, and other 
  extreme weather events will be exacerbated, making it necessary to promote measures 
  to combat climate change on a global scale.</p>
