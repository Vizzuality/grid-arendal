<h4><a name="152223"></a>15.2.2.2.3. Coastal/Marine</h4>
<p>With the concentration of population on the coasts, various development constraints 
  and environmental regulations have been enacted to protect areas of coast as 
  wildlife preserves and for harvesting of shellfish. Coastal ecosystems clearly 
  are vulnerable to change associated with eventual sea-level rise. Coastal and 
  marine biota also are vulnerable to changes in upwelling, current dynamics, 
  freshwater inflow, salinity, water temperatures, and other processes that affect 
  food webs and nursery areas (Boesch <i>et al</i>., 2000). Moreover, long-term 
  studies of estuaries such as San Francisco Bay have indicated that natural cycles 
  of ecosystem processes, such as phytoplankton blooms, are being altered on a 
  global scale by human activities. This includes manipulation of river flows, 
  input of toxic contaminants and nutrients, and invasion of exotic species (Cloern, 
  1996). Thus, in the nearer term, estuaries and coastal ecosystems may be most 
  vulnerable to hydrological changes in rivers and groundwater flows from shifts 
  in inland precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>The increased frequency and geographical range of incidents of hazardous blooms 
  in estuaries on the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts has caused serious economic 
  impacts for numerous fisheries and poses a great public health challenge in 
  closing beaches to shellfish. Consumption of toxic algae by shellfish causes 
  the shellfish to contain concentrations of toxins that are high enough to cause 
  paralysis and death of humans who consume the shellfish. This situation has 
  raised concerns that increased nitrogen loading to watersheds has led not only 
  to general coastal eutrophication but also to a greater probability of circumstances 
  that are conducive to these blooms. Factors that appear to contribute to harmful 
  algal bloom occurrence are warmer temperatures and high runoff from watersheds 
  that feed the estuaries, although much remains to be learned and predictive 
  capability has yet to be achieved. Thus, indirect effects of climate change, 
  which exacerbate the hazardous algal bloom problem, could be significant and 
  difficult to identify until better understanding is gained (Anderson, 1997; 
  see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<h4> <a name="152224"></a>15.2.2.2.4. Wildlife</h4>
<p>The Endangered Species Act in the United States and other regulatory efforts 
  preserve and manage wildlife populations in many regions of North America. These 
  efforts have begun to involve habitat protection and ecosystem management rather 
  than taking a strict population focus. Changes in habitats driven by climate 
  change could further restrict wildlife populations. One process would be causing 
  habitats to be less interconnected, restricting migration of individuals among 
  different populations and causing loss of genetic diversity within more isolated 
  populations. This process is a concern for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.<br>
</p>
<p>Fish populations and other aquatic resources are likely to be affected by warmer 
  water temperatures, changes in seasonal flow regimes, total flows, lake levels, 
  and water quality. These changes will affect the health of aquatic ecosystems, 
  with impacts on productivity, species diversity, and species distribution (Arnell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996). For example, warming of lakes and deepening of thermoclines will 
  cause a loss of habitat for coldwater fish in areas such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, 
  and decreases in summer flow and increased temperatures will cause loss and 
  fractionation of riverine habitat for coolwater fish species in the Rocky Mountain 
  region (Rahel <i>et al</i>., 1996; Cushing, 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Wetlands and dependent wildlife resources may be adversely affected by general 
  increases in evapotranspiration and reduced summer soil moisture, which may 
  reduce the extent of semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands, particularly in the 
  prairie regions of North America (Poiani <i>et al</i>., 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>The state of terrestrial wildlife in North America varies geographically, by 
  taxa, and by habitat association. In general, biodiversity increases from north 
  to south, and species that are associated with rare habitats are most likely 
  to be at high risk of extinction (Dobson <i>et al</i>., 1997; Ricketts <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  Many factors can cause a species to be at risk of extinction, but the most common 
  causes include loss of habitat, pressures from introduced species or hunting, 
  and reduced fitness as a result of chemical contaminants (Wilson, 1992; Meffe 
  and Carroll, 1994). A minimum estimate of the number of species at risk comes 
  from data for the United States, for which a recent summary suggests that 42 
  mammal species, 56 bird species, 28 reptile species, and 25 amphibian species 
  are considered at least vulnerable to extinction (UNEP, 2000). Key additional 
  pressures on wildlife associated with global climate change include changes 
  in temperature and precipitation, changes in sea level, and changes in the frequency 
  of extreme weather events (Peters, 1992; Parmesan <i>et al</i>., 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Climate-related pressures can act directly on wildlife through physiological 
  effects (i.e., changes in growth rates, food demands, abilities to reproduce 
  and survive) or indirectly through effects on other plant and animal species 
  (e.g., Payette, 1987; Lewis, 1993; Post and Stenseth, 1999). These physiological 
  effects can lead to changes in the range and abundance of North American species; 
  recent studies suggest that we already are seeing climate-linked changes in 
  butterflies (Parmesan, 1996) and desert-associated species (Brown <i>et al</i>., 
  1997b; Smith <i>et al</i>., 1998a). A key potential indirect effect of climate 
  change on wildlife is loss of total habitat available as a result of changes 
  in the distribution of a particular habitat type. An obvious example is loss 
  of coastal habitat as a result of sea-level rise; in many places, coastal habitats 
  will not be able to shift inland because adjacent lands already are developed 
  (Harris and Cropper Jr., 1992; Daniels <i>et al</i>., 1993). Similarly, potential 
  shifts in the ranges of species in northern habitats are bounded by the Arctic 
  Ocean (Kerr and Packer, 1998). A second key impact of climate-change related 
  pressures on wildlife relate to how species interact with other species on which 
  they depend. Because temperature and precipitation can be triggers for many 
  wildlife behaviors, changes in these factors may differentially impact species 
  in the same location. We already have evidence that the timing of bird migrations 
  (Bradley <i>et al</i>., 1999; Inouye <i>et al</i>., 1999), bird breeding (Brown 
  and Li, 1996; Brown <i>et al</i>., 1999; Dunn and Winkler, 1999), and emergence 
  of hibernating mammals (Inouye <i>et al</i>., 1999) is becoming earlier. Depending 
  on how food sources and other related species respond to changes, wildlife may 
  become decoupled from the many ecological relationships of which they are a 
  part. </p>
