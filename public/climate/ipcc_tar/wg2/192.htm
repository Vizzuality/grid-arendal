<h4>4.7.2.2. Coastal and Marine Zones (TAR Chapter 6)</h4>
<p>The ecology and morphology of river deltas reflect a balance between coastal 
  and upstream processes. Changes in freshwater flow regimes will impact deltas, 
  although the effects probably will be smaller than those of sea-level rise. 
  Estuary characteristics also are affected by inflows from upstream, and the 
  relative effects of sea-level rise and changes in river flows may be similar. 
  Saline intrusion along estuaries, associated with higher sea levels and perhaps 
  exacerbated by lower river flows, could threaten low-lying freshwater intakes, 
  although adaptive options (relocation) are easy to implement. Saline intrusion 
  into coastal aquifers also is a possibility, creating severe adaptation challenges 
  in some settings&#151;particularly low-lying islands such as atolls. Finally, 
  rivers bring large quantities of nutrients and other materials to the coastal 
  zone, and these fluxes are likely to be affected by changes in streamflow volumes 
  in particular.</p>
<h4><a name="4723"></a>4.7.2.3. Settlements (TAR Chapter 7)</h4>
<p>Provision of water to cities&#151;especially the mega-cities emerging in some 
  parts of the developing world&#151;may become increasingly problematic, with 
  consequent effects on city growth and access to safe water. Altered river flows 
  also may affect the ability of settlements to dispose of waste safely. Urban 
  storm drainage is potentially very sensitive to changes in short-duration rainfall 
  and is both expensive to install and difficult to upgrade. Finally, changes 
  in flood flows imply changes in urban flood risk; indications are that the risk 
  generally will increase.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable parts of the mega-cities are the informal settlements that 
  do not have planned water distribution and sanitation systems. Rural populations 
  also are exposed to climate change, and it is possible that their sensitivity 
  to change may be greater: The urban population enjoys planned water supply systems 
  that can adapt to changes of climate change better than unplanned systems in 
  rural areas.</p>
<h4><a name="4724"></a>4.7.2.4. Financial Services (TAR Chapter 8)</h4>
<p>The main linkage with the finance sector is through insurance and public disaster 
  relief. Insurance against flood losses is available in some countries, and major 
  flood events in these countries could challenge&#151;at least temporarily&#151;local 
  and perhaps international insurers. </p>
<h4><a name="4725"></a>4.7.2.5. Health (TAR Chapter 9)</h4>
<p>Changes in hydrological regimes have the potential to alter health risks. Most 
  important are potential changes in access to safe drinking water, but that is 
  likely to be more affected by factors other than climate change (such as provision 
  of water distribution systems and improved sanitation). Water-borne diseases 
  and water-related insect vector diseases are more sensitive to changes in hydrological 
  patterns (e.g., Patz et al., 1998; Checkley et al., 2000). Floods have associated 
  health problems, and climate change also has the potential to alter contamination 
  of water supplies (through changes in flow pathways that lead to increased leaching 
  of pollutants and through reduced flows that lead to increased concentrations) 
  and contamination of shellfish and fish.</p>
<h3><a name="473"></a>4.7.3. Water and Conflict</h3>
<p>A change in water availability has the potential to induce conflict between 
  different users (Biswas, 1994; Dellapena, 1999). These users may be in the same 
  area&#151;cities versus farmers, for example&#151;or they may be in different 
  parts of the river basin. Much has been written about the potential for international 
  conflict (hot or cold) over water resources (e.g., Gleick, 1998); where there 
  are disputes, the threat of climate change is likely to exacerbate, rather than 
  ameliorate, matters because of uncertainty about the amount of future resources 
  that it engenders. One major implication of climate change for agreements between 
  competing users (within a region or upstream versus downstream) is that allocating 
  rights in absolute terms may lead to further disputes in years to come when 
  the total absolute amount of water available may be different.</p>
