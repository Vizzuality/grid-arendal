<h2>3.4. Coastal Zones and Marine Ecosystems </h2>
<p>Large-scale impacts of climate change on oceans are expected to include increases 
  in sea surface temperature and mean global sea level, decreases in sea-ice cover, 
  and changes in salinity, wave conditions, and ocean circulation. The oceans 
  are an integral and responsive component of the climate system with important 
  physical and biogeochemical feedbacks to climate. Many marine ecosystems are 
  sensitive to climate change. Climate trends and variability as reflected in 
  multiyear climate-ocean regimes (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and switches 
  from one regime to another are now recognized to strongly affect fish abundance 
  and population dynamics, with significant impacts on fish-dependent human societies. 
  [<a href="034.htm">4.4</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>Many coastal areas will experience increased levels of flooding, accelerated 
  erosion, loss of wetlands and mangroves, and seawater intrusion into freshwater 
  sources as a result of climate change. The extent and severity of storm impacts, 
  including storm-surge floods and shore erosion, will increase as a result of 
  climate change including sea-level rise. High-latitude coasts will experience 
  added impacts related to higher wave energy and permafrost degradation. Changes 
  in relative sea level will vary locally due to uplift and subsidence caused 
  by other factors. [<a href="034.htm">4.4</a>]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Impacts on highly diverse and productive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, 
  atolls and reef islands, salt marshes and mangrove forests will depend upon 
  the rate of sea-level rise relative to growth rates and sediment supply, space 
  for and obstacles to horizontal migration, changes in the climate-ocean environment 
  such as sea surface temperatures and storminess, and pressures from human activities 
  in coastal zones. Episodes of coral bleaching over the past 20 years have been 
  associated with several causes, including increased ocean temperatures. Future 
  sea surface warming would increase stress on coral reefs and result in increased 
  frequency of marine diseases (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  [<a href="034.htm">4.4</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>Assessments of adaptation strategies for coastal zones have shifted emphasis 
  away from hard protection structures of shorelines (e.g., seawalls, groins) 
  toward soft protection measures (e.g., beach nourishment), managed retreat, 
  and enhanced resilience of biophysical and socioeconomic systems in coastal 
  regions. Adaptation options for coastal and marine management are most effective 
  when incorporated with policies in other areas, such as disaster mitigation 
  plans and land-use plans. [<a href="034.htm">4.4</a>]</p>
