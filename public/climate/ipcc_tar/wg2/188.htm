<h3><a name="463"></a>4.6.3. Implications of Climate Change for Water Management 
  Policy</h3>
<p>Climate change exaggerates current pressures in water management&#151;adding 
  to the debate on sound management strategies&#151;and adds a new component. 
  This new component relates to uncertainty in climate change: How can water management 
  efficiently adapt to climate change, given that the magnitude (or possibly even 
  the direction) of change is not known? Conventionally, water resource managers 
  assume that the future resource base will be the same as that of the past and 
  therefore that estimates of indices such as average reservoir yield or probable 
  maximum flood that are based on past data will apply in the future. There are 
  two issues: assessing alternatives in the face of uncertainty and making decisions 
  on the basis of this assessment.</p>
<p>Techniques for assessing alternatives include scenario analysis and risk analysis. 
  Scenario analysis is central to climate change impact assessment, but it is 
  not widely used in water resource assessment (although there are some very important 
  exceptions, such as at the federal level in the United States). Scenario analysis, 
  as in climate change impact assessment, tends to involve simulation of the effects 
  of different scenarios, although in water resources assessment these tend to 
  be different demand and operational scenarios rather than different climate 
  scenarios. Stakhiv (1998) argues that if water managers already adopt a scenario-based 
  approach, as at the federal level in the United States (Lins and Stakhiv, 1998), 
  climate change therefore does not cause any additional conceptual challenges 
  to water management: Climate change can be regarded simply as an extra type 
  of scenario. However, the uncertain nature of climate change and the potential 
  for nonlinearities in impact mean not only that the range of scenarios conventionally 
  considered may be too narrow but also that a larger number of scenarios must 
  be evaluated. In practice, scenario-based approaches are used in few water management 
  agencies, and adoption of scenario analysis would challenge conventional water 
  management practices in many countries.</p>
<p>Risk analysis involves assessment of the risk of certain thresholds being crossed 
  under different possible futures (Major, 1998). It generally involves stochastic 
  simulation of hydrological data to develop a sampling distribution of possible 
  futures. In principle, climate change can be incorporated into risk analysis 
  by changing the underlying population from which data are generated according 
  to climate change scenarios. Matalas (1997) discusses the role of stochastic 
  simulation in the context of climate change and argues that given the wide range 
  in futures that often is simulated by assuming a stationary climate, the operational 
  assumption of stationarity may remain appropriate in the face of climate change 
  in some regions. However, it is possible that climate change could generate 
  futures outside those produced under stationarity, and it cannot be assumed 
  that climate change can be ignored in all circumstances.</p>
<p>The second main issue is that of decisionmaking under uncertainty. This issue 
  was widely investigated during the 1960s and 1970s, largely in the context of 
  uncertainties about demands or the precise distribution of floods and droughts 
  over the short and medium terms. Climate change has revived interest in decisionmaking 
  under uncertainty, and several analyses of different techniques have been published 
  (e.g., Fisher and Rubio, 1997; Frederick, 1997; Hobbs, 1997; Hobbs et al., 1997; 
  Luo and Caselton, 1997; Chao et al., 1999). There still is considerable debate. 
  Hobbs (1997), for example, concludes that Bayesian approaches involving allocation 
  of probabilities to specific outcomes are more suitable than Dempster-Shafer 
  reasoning (which requires the analyst to assign probabilities to ranges&#151;perhaps 
  overlapping&#151;of outcomes), but Luo and Caselton (1997) conclude the reverse. 
  Particularly significant is the issue of assigning probabilities to alternative 
  possible futures. Hobbs et al. (1997) note unease among water planners in assigning 
  subjective probabilities to different futures. </p>

<p> Planners of water resource and flood protection schemes conventionally cope 
  with uncertainty by adding a safety factor to design estimates. This safety 
  factor usually is defined arbitrarily. As part of a review of water resource 
  design practices in the UK, a more formal approach to calculation of this safety 
  factor, or &#147;headroom,&#148; has been developed (UKWIR, 1998). This procedure 
  identifies eight sources of supply-side uncertainty and three sources of demand-side 
  uncertainty, each of which is given a score. The total score is summed and converted 
  into a percentage value for the headroom allowance (with a maximum of 20%). 
  Climate change is included as one of the supply-side uncertainties; its score 
  depends on the range of estimates of supply-yield under four defined climate 
  change scenarios (<a href="#tab414">Table 4-14</a>). Although this approach 
  has many arbitrary elements, it does represent a systematic approach to the 
  treatment of climate change uncertainties in water resources assessment.</p>
<p>Different aspects of the water sector have different planning horizons and 
  infrastructure lifetimes. The parts of the water sector with long horizons and 
  lifetimes need to take a different approach to climate change than parts with 
  shorter lead times; one assessment and decision methodology will not be suitable 
  for all managers.</p>
