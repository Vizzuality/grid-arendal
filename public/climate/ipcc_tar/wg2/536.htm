<h3>14.2.3. Sea-Level Rise </h3>
<h4><a name="14231"></a>14.2.3.1. General Impacts </h4>
<p>Information on areas of land loss in several countries of Latin America as 
  a result of sea-level rise is synthesized in Table 6-5 of the IPCC Special Report 
  on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (IPCC, 1998). Fishing production is a 
  sector that would suffer as a consequence of sea-level rise. Along the Central 
  American coastline, sea-level rise will affect infrastructure, agriculture, 
  and natural resources, as well as potentially exacerbate coastal erosion and 
  salinization of aquifers and increase flood risks and the impact of severe storms 
  (Campos <i>et al</i>., 1997; MINAE-IMN, 2000). </p>
<p>Chapter 6 of the Special Report identified information on the economic cost 
  of sea-level rise in Latin America as assessed by Saizar (1997) and Olivo (1997) 
  for the Uruguayan and Venezuelan coastlines, respectively. Saizar (1997) assessed 
  the potential impacts of a 0.5-m sea-level rise on the coast of Montevideo (Uruguay). 
  Given no adaptive response, the cost of such a rise in sea level was estimated 
  to be US$23 million, with a shoreline recession of 56 m and land loss of 6.8 
  ha. Olivo (1997) studied the potential economic impacts of a 0.5-m sea-level 
  rise on the coast of Venezuela. At six study sites, she identified land and 
  infrastructure at risk&#151;such as oil infrastructure, urban areas, and tourist 
  infrastructure. Evaluating four scenarios, Olivo (1997) suggests that Venezuela 
  cannot afford the costs of sea-level rise, either in terms of land and infrastructure 
  lost under a no-protection policy or in terms of the costs involved in any of 
  three protection policies. </p>
<p>Coastal wetlands in the region endure the impact of population growth, expansion 
  of the agricultural activity, and land-use changes.</p>
<p>Observed sea-level rise at the local or regional level in Latin America could 
  be greater than the global average value (Field, 1995; Codignotto, 1997; Kjerve 
  and Macintosh, 1997). Negative trends in river streamflow along the Patagonian 
  coast may result in reduction of sediments toward deposition areas. Coastal 
  erosion would be affected by this effect as well as increased sea level (Codignotto, 
  1997; Kokot, 1999). </p>
<h4>14.2.3.1.1. Mangrove ecosystem<a name="142311"></a></h4>
<p>The response of mangrove forests to changes in sea level within 50-100 
  years under climate change conditions is complex and controversial; it depends 
  on physiography as well as ecological and biological factors (Villamizar, 1994; 
  Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996; Ewel and Twilley, 1998; Rull <i>et al.</i>, 1999). 
</p>
<p>The land-building function of mangrove vegetation has very important implications 
  in coastal management because it works as a natural barrier to protect adjacent 
  agricultural land by reducing erosion caused by wave action, tides, and river 
  flow. This is important for shallow estuaries that are prone to flooding, especially 
  where the land is below sea level (Twilley<i> et al.</i>, 1997; Villamizar and 
  Fonseca, 1999). </p>
<p>In the tropical Americas, the loss of coastal forests, mainly mangroves, occurs 
  at a rate of approximately 1% yr<sup>-1</sup>. The rate is much faster in the 
  Caribbean&#151;approximately 1.7% yr<sup>-1</sup> (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1997). 
  Because most commercial shellfish and finfish use mangal for nurseries and refuge, 
  fisheries in mangrove regions are declining at a similar rate as mangrove communities 
  (Mart&iacute;nez <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Ewel and Twilley, 1998).</p>
