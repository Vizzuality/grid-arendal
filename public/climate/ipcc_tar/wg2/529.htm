<h2>14.2. Key Regional Concerns</h2>
<p>Studies developed after the<i> Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate 
  Change </i>(RICC) add new findings on the potential impact of climate change 
  on different sectors in Latin America. Many of these new studies evolved from 
  those mentioned in RICC, indicating that a process is in place in Latin America 
  to reduce uncertainties associated with climate change. </p>
<h3><a name="1421"></a>14.2.1. Natural Ecosystems</h3>
<p>Climate variations produce a variety of impacts on natural ecosystems (see 
  <a href="218.htm">Sections 5.4</a> to <a href="276.htm">5.9</a>). Latin America 
  possesses a large quantity of ecosystems, ranging from Amazonian tropical rainforest 
  to cold Andean systems (Paramos). It also hosts remarkable rangelands, shrublands, 
  deserts, savannas, grasslands, coastal wetlands (mainly along the Caribbean 
  and Atlantic coastlines), and inland freshwater wetlands such as Pantanal and 
  Iber&aacute;. Natural ecosystems in Latin America can be expected to suffer 
  a variety of impacts from climate change. Latin American humid tropical forests 
  represent an important group of ecosystems for which a great deal of information 
  is offered (e.g., Canziani <i>et al</i>., 1998). </p>
<h4><a name="14211"></a>14.2.1.1. Humid Tropical Forests</h4>
<p>Conversion of large areas of tropical forest to pasture could reduce water 
  cycling and precipitation in the region, in addition to its global role as a 
  contribution to global warming. Pasture has much less leaf area than forest 
  (McWilliam <i>et al.</i>, 1993). Because evapotranspiration is proportional 
  to leaf area, water recycled through forest is much greater than that recycled 
  through pasture&#151;especially in the dry season, when pasture is dry but forest 
  remains evergreen (Roberts <i>et al</i>., 1996). This is aggravated by the much 
  higher runoff under pasture, with measured increases of more than 1,000% in 
  small (10m<sup>2</sup>) plots (Fearnside, 1989). Pasture grasses can partially 
  compensate for reduced evapotranspiration by increasing their efficiency of 
  water use when soil moisture is low, whereas forest trees maintain constant 
  efficiency (McWilliam <i>et al</i>., 1993). Soil under pasture quickly becomes 
  highly compacted, inhibiting infiltration of rainwater into the soil (Schubart 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1976). Rain falling on compacted soil runs off quickly, becoming 
  unavailable for later release to the atmosphere through transpiration. The shallower 
  root system of pasture, compared to that of forest, prevents pasture from transpiring 
  during periods of drought (Nepstad <i>et al</i>., 1994, 1999). Precipitation 
  decreases therefore are greatest at the time of year when rain is most needed.</p>
<p>If the extent of deforestation were to expand to substantially larger areas, 
  we have high confidence that reduced evapotranspiration will lead to less rainfall 
  during dry periods in Amazonia and medium confidence that rainfall will be reduced 
  in the center-west, center-south, and south regions of Brazil (Lean <i>et al</i>., 
  1996). Although the annual rainfall total in Amazonia would decrease by only 
  7% from conversion to pasture, based on simulations with the Hadley Centre model, 
  in August (dry season) the average rainfall would decrease from 2.2 mm day<sup>-1</sup> 
  with forest to 1.5 mm day<sup>-1</sup> with pasture&#151;a 32% decrease (Lean 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Simulations of conversions of Amazonian forest to pasture, 
  using the M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France EMERAUDE GCM, indicate reduced volumetric 
  soil moisture in the "arc of deforestation" where clearing activity 
  is concentrated along the southern boundary of the Amazon forest. Rainfall reduction 
  in southern Brazil is greatest for the January-March period (Manzi and 
  Planton, 1996).</p>
<p>Greater dependence of Amazonian rainfall on water derived from evapotranspiration 
  in the dry season means that conversion to pasture would cause this period to 
  become longer and more severe&#151;a change that could have harsh repercussions 
  on the forest even if total annual precipitation were to remain unchanged (Fearnside, 
  1995). In patches of forest isolated by cattle pasture, trees on the edges of 
  forest patches die at a much greater rate than do those in continuous forest 
  (Laurance <i>et al</i>., 1997, 1998; Laurance, 1998). Because many trees die 
  while they are still standing, rather than being toppled by wind, dry conditions 
  (particularly in the air) near reserve edges are a likely explanation for mortality. 
  Soil water may partially counterbalance the effect of drier air; as trees die, 
  soil water in the gaps they leave normally increases because the roots that 
  would have removed water from the soil are gone. Increasing vines and decreasing 
  forest biomass are strongly associated near forest edges, probably as a consequence 
  of a positive feedback relationship between these factors (Laurance <i>et al</i>., 
  2000). Drier microclimatic conditions have been found at forest edges (Kapos, 
  1989). Increased water stress&#151;as indicated by altered <sup>13</sup>C in 
  plant leaves&#151;extends 60 m into the forest from an edge (Kapos et al., 1993). 
  Tree mortality increases significantly up to 100 m from the forest edge (Laurance 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Considering the length of forest edges measured by Skole 
  and Tucker (1993) for the Brazilian Amazon in 1988, a 100-m disturbance buffer 
  to these edges would represent a disturbed area in 1988 of 3.4 x 10<sup>6</sup> 
  ha, or 15% of the area cleared by that year. Forest edges, which affect an increasingly 
  large portion of the forest with the advance of deforestation, would be especially 
  susceptible to the effects of reduced rainfall.</p>
<p>Greater severity of droughts reinforced by deforestation effects could lead 
  to erosion of the remainder of the forest once a substantial portion of the 
  region had been converted to pasture. The greatest effects are likely to occur 
  during occasional complex phenomena such as El Ni&ntilde;o (Tian <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Nepstad <i>et al</i>., 1999). Precipitation in Amazonia is characterized 
  by tremendous variability from 1 year to the next, even in the absence of massive 
  deforestation (e.g., Fearnside, 1984; Walker <i>et al</i>., 1995). If the forest's 
  contribution to dry-season rainfall were to decrease, the result would be to 
  increase the probability of droughts that are more severe than those experienced 
  in the centuries or millennia over which the present forest became established. 
  Occasional severe droughts would kill many trees of susceptible species. The 
  result would be replacement of tropical moist forest with more drought-tolerant 
  forms of scrubby, open vegetation resembling the <i>cerrado</i> (scrub savanna) 
  of central Brazil (Shukla<i> et al.</i>, 1990)</p>
<p>Until recently, burning in Amazonia has been almost entirely restricted to 
  areas where trees have been felled and allowed to dry before being set alight. 
  Fire normally stops burning when it reaches the edge of a clearing rather than 
  continuing into unfelled forest. Archaeological evidence suggests that catastrophic 
  fires have occurred in Amazonia during major El Ni&ntilde;o events four times 
  over the past 2,000 years: 1,500, 1,000, 700, and 400 BP (Meggers, 1994). Human 
  action could now turn less intensive El Ni&ntilde;o events, which are much more 
  frequent than major ones, into catastrophes. Increased fire initiation foci, 
  together with increased forest flammability from logging, already have resulted 
  in substantial incursions of fires into standing forest in eastern and southern 
  Amazonia during dry years (Uhl and Buschbacher, 1985; Uhl and Kauffman, 1990; 
  Cochrane and Schulze, 1999; Cochrane <i>et al</i>., 1999; Nepstad <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999). The 1998-1999 fires in Roraima, in the far northern portion of Brazil, 
  reflect the vulnerability of standing forests in Amazonia during El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events now that settlement areas in the forest provide permanent opportunities 
  for fire initiation (Barbosa and Fearnside, 1999).</p>
<p>Increases in the amount of biomass burning could affect nutrient cycling in 
  Amazonian forest ecosystems (medium confidence) (Fearnside, 1995). Droughts 
  lead to increases in the area and completeness of burning in clearings in Amazonia, 
  contributing to smoke and dust that function as sources of wind-borne nutrients 
  to the surrounding forest (Talbot <i>et al.</i>, 1990). Climatic change also 
  could increase nutrient supply via long-range transport of dust. African dust 
  transported across the Atlantic Ocean by winds may be supplying significant 
  amounts of phosphorus and calcium to Amazonia (Swap <i>et al.</i>, 1992). Amazonian 
  soils are very poor in these elements. Soil nutrients are among the factors 
  that limit growth, recruitment, and mortality of trees (Laurance <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Sollins, 1998). Smoke and ash particles from burning in savannas, possibly 
  including those in Africa, also contribute nutrients (Talbot <i>et al.</i>, 
  1990). The extent to which these nutrient sources could increase the growth 
  of Amazonian forests is not known. Increases undoubtedly differ by tree species, 
  thereby altering forest composition. Burning is affected by climate, as well 
  as by the size and behavior of the human population. Factors that influence 
  the growth of intact forests in Amazonia are particularly important because 
  of the large amounts of carbon that could be released to or removed from the 
  atmosphere if the balance between forest growth and decay is altered.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment is believed to contribute to observed imbalances 
  between CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and release by forest biomass in Amazonia; forest 
  recovery from past disturbances also may contribute to these imbalances. Eddy 
  correlation measurements (studies of gas movements in air flows inside and immediately 
  above the forest) at one site in Rond&ocirc;nia indicated an uptake of 1.0 &plusmn; 
  0.2 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Grace <i>et al.</i>, 1995). A similar 
  eddy correlation study near Manaus found uptake of 5.9 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (Malhi <i>et al</i>., 1999). An estimate based on reviewing existing measurements 
  of tree growth and mortality in permanent plots found mean uptake of 0.62 &plusmn; 
  0.37 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Phillips <i>et al.</i>, 1998). On 
  the other hand, at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments site near Manaus 
  (the largest and longest running study included in the forest growth measurement 
  data set), no uptake or loss was found in 36 1-ha control plots located &gt;100 
  m from a forest edge (Laurance <i>et al.,</i> 1997). The Rond&ocirc;nia and 
  Manaus eddy correlation studies and the basin-wide review of tree growth indicate 
  uptakes of 0.63, 3.66, and 0.38 x 10<sup>9</sup> t C, respectively, when extrapolated 
  on the basis of consistent definitions of forest that indicate a total area 
  of forest in the Amazon Basin of 620.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> ha (Fearnside, 2000). 
  A process-based model of undisturbed ecosystems in the Amazon Basin, including 
  savannas and forests (not necessarily defined as above), indicates wide interannual 
  variations in net carbon flux from vegetation and soil, ranging from emissions 
  of 0.2 x 10<sup>9</sup> t C in El Ni&ntilde;o years to a sink of as much as 
  0.7 x 10<sup>9</sup> t C in other years; mean annual flux simulated over the 
  1980-1994 period gives an uptake of 0.2 x 10<sup>9</sup> t C (Tian <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1998). If the frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o events increases as a consequence 
  of global warming (Timmermann <i>et al.</i>, 1999), these forests may release 
  some of their large carbon stocks to the atmosphere. The future course of accumulation 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere&#151;and consequently the time when concentrations 
  would reach "dangerous" levels&#151;depends heavily on continued uptake 
  of carbon by the biosphere, including an important contribution from Amazonian 
  forests. Climate effects contribute to making the sink in Amazonian forests 
  unreliable as a brake on atmospheric carbon accumulation. </p>
<p>Although temperature changes from global warming are expected to be modest 
  in the tropics as compared to temperate regions, it is important to realize 
  that each degree of temperature alteration in a tropical environment may be 
  "perceived" by forest species there as a greater change than would 
  be the case for the same temperature shift in a temperate forest (Janzen, 1967). 
  The direct effects of global warming on ecosystems at relatively low latitudes, 
  if not at the equator itself, therefore may be greater than the small predicted 
  temperature alterations at these sites might lead one to believe. In addition, 
  direct effects of global warming through temperature change are likely to be 
  less pronounced than effects that temperature can have through its influence 
  on other climatic parameters, such as rainfall (Fearnside, 1995).</p>
<p>GCMs indicate a range of results for the effect of global warming on precipitation 
  in Amazonia. Drying generally is expected; some models indicating greater drying 
  than others. The Hadley Centre's HadCM2 model indicates especially dry 
  climate over Amazonia. Process-based ecosystem models that use this simulated 
  climate show large declines in net primary productivity (NPP) and release of 
  carbon as a result of Amazonian forest dieback (Friend <i>et al.</i>, 1997). 
  The varied GCM results suggest the need for a range of climate scenarios as 
  inputs to ecosystem simulations (Bolin <i>et al</i>., 2000). It should be noted 
  that available scenarios (e.g., Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 2000) represent the 
  change in climate resulting from altered composition of the atmosphere only, 
  not the additional impacts of regional land-use changes such as replacement 
  of Amazonian forest by pasture.</p>
<p>Globally, models show that a doubling of GHGs may lead to a 10-15% expansion 
  of the area that is suitable for tropical forests as equilibrium vegetation 
  types (Solomon <i>et al.</i>, 1993). For tropical rainforest, the suitable area 
  would expand 7-40%, depending on the GCM employed in estimating the future 
  distribution of climatic zones. The GCM studies used by Solomon<i> et al.</i> 
  (1993) assess the effects of doubled GHGs (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalence), 
  through the direct effects of temperature and through temperature-driven alteration 
  of precipitation regimes (but not rainfall changes provoked by deforestation). 
  These results are indicators of <i>potential</i> for forest expansion and are 
  not intended to reflect expected landscapes in the future; they do not include 
  the influence of human populations in converting to other uses land that is 
  climatically suitable for tropical forests.</p>
<p>One model that includes climate-induced and human changes to the year 2050 
  points to decreases in forest areas by about 5% in Latin America (Zuidema <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1994). The deforestation estimates used in these calculations are based 
  on the areas needed to satisfy expected demands for agricultural products. In 
  the case of Brazil, deforestation is likely to exceed these forecasts because 
  much of the forest clearing stems from motivations other than consumption of 
  agricultural products (Hecht<i> et al</i>., 1988; Reis and Margulis, 1991; Hecht, 
  1993; Fearnside, 1997). In any case, the combination of forces driving deforestation 
  makes it unlikely that tropical forests will be permitted to expand to occupy 
  the increased areas that are made climatically suitable for them by global warming. 
  Land-use change interacts with climate through positive feedback processes that 
  accelerate the loss of Brazil's Amazonian forests.</p>
