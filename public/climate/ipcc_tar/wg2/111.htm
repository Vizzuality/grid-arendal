<h3>2.6.6. Building Experience with Subjective Methods In a "Science for 
  Policy" Assessment</h3>
<p>Although one might be tempted to infer from the foregoing arguments that judgments 
  of likelihood should be considered only with caution, for some decision analytic 
  frameworks that often appear in the climate policy literature (.g., cost-benefit 
  analysis and IAMs), there often are few viable alternatives. However, as noted 
  in the decision analysis frameworks guidance paper (Toth, 2000a; see also <a href="090.htm">Section 
  2.4</a>), several alternative decisional analytic methods are less dependent 
  on subjective probability distributions; virtually all frameworks do require 
  subjective judgments, however. Although physical properties such as weight, 
  length, and illumination have objective methods for their measurement, there 
  are no objective means for assessing in advance the probability of such things 
  as the value future societies will put on now-endangered species or the circulation 
  collapse of the North Atlantic Ocean from anticipated anthropogenic emissions. 
  Even a highly developed understanding of probability theory would be of little 
  avail because no empirical data set exists, and the underlying science is not 
  fully understood. Some authors have argued that under these circumstances, for 
  any practical application one ought to abandon any attempt to produce quantitative 
  forecasts and instead use more qualitative techniques such as scenario planning 
  (e.g., Schoemaker, 1991; van der Heijden, 1998) or argumentation (Fox, 1994). 
  On the other hand, others&#151;though noting the cognitive difficulties with 
  estimation of unique events&#151;have argued that quantitative estimations are 
  essential in environmental policy analyses that use formal and explicit methods 
  (e.g., Morgan and Henrion, 1990).</p>
<p>Given its potential utility in applied and conservation ecology, it seems surprising 
  that Bayesian analysis is relatively uncommon. However, logical and theoretical 
  virtue is not sufficient to encourage its use by managers and scientists. The 
  spread of a new idea or practice is an example of cultural evolution (in this 
  case, within the scientific community). It is best understood as a social and 
  psychological phenomenon (Anderson, 1998).</p>
<p>Helping to achieve such penetration of awareness of uncertainty analyses will 
  be a multi-step process that includes "1) consistent methods for producing verbal 
  summaries from quantitative data, 2) translation of single-event probabilities 
  into frequencies with careful definition of reference classes, 3) attention 
  to different cognitive interpretations of probability concepts, and 4) conventions 
  for graphic displays" (Anderson, 1998). The latter also is advocated in the 
  uncertainties guidance paper (Moss and Schneider, 2000), and an example is provided 
  in <a href="305.htm">Chapter 7</a> (<a href="310.htm#fig72">Figure 7-2</a>).</p>
<p>Although all arguments in the literature agree that it is essential to represent 
  uncertainties in climatic assessments, analysts disagree about the preferred 
  approach. Some simply believe that until empirical information becomes available, 
  quantitative estimates of uncertain outcomes should be avoided because "science" 
  is based on empirical testing, not subjective judgments. It certainly is true 
  that "science" itself strives for "objective" empirical 
  information to test, or "falsify," theory and models (caveats in <a href="096.htm">Section 
  2.5.2</a> about frequentism as a heuristic notwithstanding). At the same time, 
  "science for policy" must be recognized as a different enterprise 
  than "science" itself. Science for policy (e.g., Ravetz, 1986) involves 
  being responsive to policymakers' needs for expert judgment at a particular 
  time, given information currently available, even if those judgments involve 
  a considerable degree of subjectivity. The methods outlined above and in Moss 
  and Schneider (2000) are designed to make such subjectivity more consistently 
  expressed (linked to quantitative distributions when possible, as needed in 
  most decision analytic frameworks) across the TAR and more explicitly stated 
  so that well-established and highly subjective judgments are less likely to 
  get confounded in media accounts or policy debates. The key point is that <i>authors 
  should explicitly state</i> <i>their approach in each case.</i> Transparency 
  is the key to accessible assessments.</p>
