<h4>2.7.2.2. Cost-Benefit Analysis </h4>
<p>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) involves valuing all costs and benefits of a proposed 
  project over time on the basis of willingness to pay (or willingness to accept 
  compensation) on the part of project beneficiaries (affected people) and specifying 
  a decision criterion to accept or turn down the project (see Ray, 1984; Morgenstern, 
  1997). This criterion usually is the compensation principle, implying that those 
  who benefit from the project should be able to compensate the losers. The applicability 
  of CBA as a DAF for climate policy has been a fiercely debated issue. Although 
  the debate continues about the extent to which traditional CBA can provide useful 
  information for global-level decisionmaking, there is more agreement on its 
  usefulness in adaptation decisions at the national and regional scales.</p>
<p>In practical applications, all costs (C) and benefits (B) are defined as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="equ21.gif"></a><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/images/equ2-1.gif"></p>
<p></p>
<p>where <i>i</i> is the social discount rate, <i>n</i> is the project life, and 
  t denotes the year. One can use different cost-benefit criteria for ranking 
  projects or choosing the best among them: the cost-benefit ratio, <i>CBR = B/C</i> 
  &gt; 1; the net present value, <i>NPV = B - C </i>&gt; 0; and the internal 
  rate of return, <i>IRR</i> &gt; i, where IRR is the discount rate to make <i>B 
  = C</i>. When we evaluate a single project, these criteria lead to the same 
  conclusion. In choosing the most desirable alternative, however, these criteria 
  indicate different orders of desirability.</p>
<p>A CBA in the adaptation context takes potential regional climate change scenarios 
  and their impacts as its starting point. The next step is to establish costs 
  of alternative adaptive measures as a function of their scales of application&#151;the 
  marginal cost curve. A related task is to estimate how much damage can be averted 
  by increasing the adaptation effort&#151;WTP (marginal benefit curve). The decision 
  principle suggests undertaking adaptive measures as long as marginal averted 
  damages (benefits) exceed marginal costs. This rule of thumb is easier to apply 
  in sectoral adaptation decisions, in which costs and benefits can be derived 
  from market prices. Difficulties arise in nonmarket sectors in which the valuation 
  behind the marginal cost and benefit curves often is debated. Difficulties multiply, 
  in a regional context, when costs and benefits must be aggregated across many 
  sectors. </p>
<p>A frequent critique of CBA and its applicability in adaptation studies is that 
  the underlying measurements are incomplete (especially in regional studies, 
  which do not cover all important aspects), inaccurate (even the costs and benefits 
  of adaptive actions included in the analysis are impossible to measure precisely), 
  and debated (related to the two preceding points; the inclusion and exact valuation 
  of many costs and benefits involve inherently subjective value judgments). These 
  criticisms are largely valid. However, it is still better to get at least the 
  measurable components right and complement them with a combination of judgments 
  on hard-to-measure items and sensitivity tests to assess their implications 
  than to abandon the whole method simply because it does not get everything perfect. 
  Nevertheless, it is important that users of these tools and their results fully 
  understand the limitations and confidence attached to them. Duke and Kammen 
  (1999) argue that accounting for dynamic feedback between the demand response 
  and price reductions from production experience can be used to account for deadweight 
  loss and other market dynamics that determine the benefit-cost ratio of economic 
  and policy measures to expand the market for clean energy technologies. These 
  results further support a broader role for market transformation programs to 
  commercialize new environmentally attractive technologies. The same dynamic 
  feedback processes also are relevant for CBA applications to adaptation decisions. 
  For example, consider changing precipitation patterns that would increase the 
  frequency of high-water conditions. Take flood-related damages as the function 
  of flood return periods: Annual flooding may cause the least damages, whereas 
  a 5-year return flood will cause somewhat more, a 20-year return flood even 
  more, and so on. Adaptation costs increase along the same axis because it takes 
  higher dikes and larger flood protection reservoirs to control a 50-year return 
  flood than a 5-year return flood. The level at which a given society will decide 
  to protect itself against floods depends on local economic conditions and geographical 
  and technological endowments. A CBA suggests that it should be in the neighborhood 
  of where marginal costs of additional flood protection would be equal to WTP 
  for additional flood protection.</p>
