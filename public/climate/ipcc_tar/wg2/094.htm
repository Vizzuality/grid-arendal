<h3>2.5.1. Elements of Costing and Valuation Methods</h3>
<h4><a name="2511"></a>2.5.1.1. Opportunity Cost and the Foundations of Valuation 
  Methods</h4>
<p>Opportunity cost is the fundamental building block of modern economic analysis. 
  The true economic cost of one unit of some good X reflects the cost of opportunities 
  foregone by devoting resources to its production. This cost measures the economic 
  value of outputs, goods, and services that would have been possible to produce 
  elsewhere with the resources used to produce the last unit of good X. The social 
  opportunity cost of employing a resource for which there is no alternative economic 
  use is thus zero, even if its price is positive, and opportunity cost will be 
  different under conditions of full employment than under circumstances involving 
  large quantities of visible or invisible unemployment. Moreover, opportunity 
  cost applies only to small "marginal" changes from equilibrium in 
  systems for which there are multiple equilibria. Likewise, the marginal benefit 
  from consuming good X is the value of the last unit purchased, measured in terms 
  of a real price that reflects the welfare that would have been enjoyed if the 
  requisite expenditure had been devoted to consuming another good (or goods).</p>
<p>These concepts may appear circular, but that is an artifact of the circular 
  nature of economic systems. Suppliers of some economic goods are consumers of 
  others. The opportunity cost of a good to the producer and the marginal benefit 
  to the consumer are equal when all of the following conditions are obtained: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All markets are perfectly competitive.</li>
  <li>Markets are comprehensively established in the sense that all current and 
    future property rights are assigned.</li>
  <li>Marketed goods are exclusive (ownership is singular and well defined) and 
    transferable (goods can be bought, sold, or given away).</li>
  <li>The underlying social and legal systems guarantee that property rights are 
    (reasonably) secure.</li>
  <li>There are no transaction costs involved in creating and/or maintaining any 
    current or future market.</li>
  <li>There is perfect and complete information about all current and future markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these conditions, the marginal opportunity cost of any good with multiple 
  uses or multiple demanders is equal to its marginal benefit. Marginal (opportunity) 
  cost and marginal benefit then match the accounting price that can be read from 
  the market, and economic efficiency is assured in the sense that nobody can 
  be made better off without hurting somebody. </p>
<p>It is not difficult, of course, to think of circumstances in which one or more 
  of these conditions do not hold (and this is not news to the economics profession). 
  Much of modern economics has been devoted to exploring how to measure and compare 
  costs and benefits when these conditions break down. For researchers interested 
  in impacts, however, theoretical results are less important than some practical 
  insight into what to do.</p>
<p>Theory instructs, for example, that producers who have some monopoly power 
  in imperfectly competitive markets would restrict output compared to the quantity 
  that would prevail in a competitive market. Consequently, marginal opportunity 
  cost would fall short of marginal benefit even if all of the other assumptions 
  held, and the market price would overestimate marginal cost by an amount that 
  is related to the price elasticity of demand.</p>
