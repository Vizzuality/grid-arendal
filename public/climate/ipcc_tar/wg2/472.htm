<h3>12.4.4. Alpine Systems </h3>
<p>Basher <i>et al.</i> (1998) conclude that alpine systems are among the most 
  vulnerable systems in the region. Despite the fact that they cover only a small 
  area, they are important for many plant and animal species, many of which are 
  listed as threatened. These systems also are under pressure from tourism activity. 
  The Australian Alps are relatively low altitude (maximum about 2,000 m), and 
  much of the Alpine ecosystem area and ski fields are marginal. Most year-to-year 
  variability is related to large fluctuations in precipitation, but interannual 
  temperature variations are small compared to warming anticipated in the 21st 
  century. Studies by Hewitt (1994), Whetton <i>et al.</i> (1996b), and Whetton 
  (1998) all point to a high degree of sensitivity of seasonal snow cover duration 
  and depth. For Australia, Whetton (1998) estimates, for the full range of CSIRO 
  (1996a) scenarios, an 18-66% reduction in the total area of snow cover 
  by 2030 and a 39-96% reduction by 2070. This would seriously affect the 
  range of certain alpine ecosystems and species (Bennett <i>et al.</i>, 1991). 
  Decreases in precipitation and increased fire danger also would affect alpine 
  ecosystems adversely.</p>
<p>There seems to be little opportunity for adaptation by alpine ecosystems in 
  Australia, which cannot retreat upward very far because of the limited height 
  of Australian hills and mountains. There are various options for the rapidly 
  expanding mountain-based recreation industry, including increased summer recreation 
  and artificial snowmaking. These adaptations would increase stress on alpine 
  ecosystems and water resources.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Alps are of higher altitude (up to 3,700 m); about 9% of the 
  New Zealand landmass is above the treeline. A large number of species (for example, 
  25% of vascular plants), which often are highly distinctive, grow there. Despite 
  a 0.5&deg;C rise in New Zealand's mean annual temperatures since the 1860s, 
  there has been no significant rise in the treeline or shrubland expansion (Wardle 
  and Coleman, 1992), and it seems unlikely that there will be any significant 
  threat to alpine ecosystems from warming in the medium term.</p>

<h3>12.4.5. Wetlands</h3>
<p>The Australian State of the Environment Report (1996) states, "Wetlands 
  continue to be under threat, and large numbers are already destroyed." 
  For example, Johnson <i>et al.</i> (1999) estimate wetland loss of about 70% in the 
  Herbert River catchment of Northern Queensland between 1943 and 1996. Wetland 
  loss is caused by many processes, including water storage; hydroelectric and 
  irrigation schemes; dams, weirs, and river management works; desnagging and 
  channelization; changes to flow, water level, and thermal regimes; removal of 
  instream cover; increased siltation; toxic pollution and destruction of nursery 
  and spawning or breeding areas (Jackson, 1997); and use of wetlands for agriculture 
  (Johnson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Climate change will add to these factors through changes 
  in inflow and increased water losses.<br>
  Specific threats to wetlands from climate change and sea-level rise have been 
  studied as part of a national vulnerability assessment (Waterman, 1996). The 
  best example is provided for Kakadu National Park in northern Australia. There 
  are fears that World Heritage and Ramsar-recognized freshwater wetlands in this 
  park could become saline, given current expectations of sea-level rise and climate 
  change (Bayliss <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Eliot <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Although this analysis is 
  supported by a large data resource, it is speculative, and efforts to develop 
  more definite monitoring tools are needed. However, it does raise the possibility 
  that many other Australian coastal wetlands could be similarly affected. Some 
  of these wetlands may be unable to migrate upstream because of physical barriers 
  in the landscape.</p>
<p>Many inland wetlands are subject to reduced frequency of filling as a result 
  of water diversion for irrigation, and they also may be seriously affected by 
  reductions in seasonal or annual rainfalls in the catchments as a result of 
  climate change (Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i>, 1998). This may threaten the 
  reproduction of migratory birds (some species of which already are under threat), 
  which rely on wetlands for their breeding cycle (Kingsford and Thomas, 1995; 
  Kingsford and Johnson, 1998; Kingsford <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Large decreases in inflow 
  predicted for the Macquarie River and several rivers in northern Victoria by 
  Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i> (1998) and Schreider <i>et al.</i> (1996, 1997) for scenarios 
  that are consistent with the latest AOGCM simulations would have major impacts 
  on wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Wetlands in New Zealand are the most threatened ecosystems; they have declined 
  by 85% since European settlement (Stephenson, 1983). The vast majority have 
  been drained or irretrievably modified by fire, grazing, flood control works, 
  reclamation, or creation of reservoirs. Eutrophification, weed invasion, and 
  pollution have greatly reduced their biodiversity (Taylor and Smith, 1997). 
  More than 50% of the 73 significant wetlands that meet the Ramsar Convention 
  standards for international wetlands are in coastal districts and will be impacted 
  by rising sea levels. Most important wetlands are in highly urbanized or productive 
  landscape settings and therefore have limited options for adaptation to decreased 
  size or increased salinization. </p>

<h3>12.4.6. Riverine Environments</h3>
<p>Many Australian river systems, particularly in the southeast and southwest, 
  have been degraded through diversion of water via dams, barrages, channels, 
  and so forth, principally for irrigated agriculture. Many New Zealand rivers 
  have been affected by hydroelectric generation; diversion of water for irrigation; 
  agricultural, manufacturing, and urban pollution; and biotic invasion. Recent 
  research has shown that river ecosystems are particularly sensitive to extremes 
  in flow. Most research has been on the effects of flood flows. Droughts, as 
  opposed to floods, have a slow onset and although recovery from floods by river 
  flora and fauna is relatively rapid, recovery after droughts tends to be slow, 
  may be incomplete, and may lag well behind the breaking of the drought (Lake, 
  2000). Floods and droughts interact with nutrient supply (Hildrew and Townsend, 
  1987; Biggs, 1996), so the effects of any possible changes in their frequency 
  and magnitude need to be evaluated within the context of other human activities 
  and climate-induced land-use change.</p>
<p>Current ranges of scenarios tend to suggest reductions in mean flow in many 
  Australian rivers, similar to or greater than those in Schreider <i>et al.</i> (1997) 
  and Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i> (1998). In particular, any tendency toward 
  more frequent or severe El Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions beyond that already contained 
  in the CSIRO (1996a) scenarios would further threaten many riverine and inland 
  wetland systems in Australia and New Zealand. Findings of increased drought 
  frequency and severity in eastern Australia under an NCAR CCMO transient simulation 
  (Kothavala, 1999) and 12-35% reductions in mean flow by 2050 in the Murray-Darling 
  basin by the 2050s in Arnell (1999), using results from the HadCM2 and HadCM3 
  GCM simulations, are cause for concern. Arnell (1999) found reductions in maximum 
  and minimum flows. Walsh <i>et al.</i> (2000) found less severe increases in drought 
  in Queensland, based on simulations with the CSIRO RCM nested in the CSIRO Mark 
  2 GCM.</p>
<p>Implications of these findings for riverine ecosystems and estuaries (Vance 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Loneragan and Bunn, 1999) and possible adaptations have yet to 
  be investigated, although reduced diversions from rivers to increase environmental 
  flows is one possibility. This could be achieved through increased WUE, imposition 
  of caps on water diversions, or water pricing and trading, but the latter two 
  measures are controversial and would have strong implications for rural industry 
  (e.g., see ABARE, 1999). Increased efficiency in water delivery for irrigation 
  currently is the favored option for restoring environmental flows in the heavily 
  depleted Snowy River in southeastern Australia.<br>
