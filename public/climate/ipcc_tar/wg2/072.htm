<h4>2.2.1.2. Predicted Biological Responses to Climatic Warming Trends </h4>
<p>All organisms are influenced by climate and weather events. Physiological and 
  ecological thresholds shape species distributions (i.e., where species can survive 
  and reproduce) and the timing of their life cycles (i.e., periods of growth, 
  reproduction, and dormancy) (Uvarov, 1931; MacArthur, 1972; Precht <i>et al</i>., 
  1973; Weiser, 1973; Brown <i>et al</i>., 1996; Hoffman and Parsons, 1997; Saether, 
  1997) In the face of a local environmental change, such as a systematic change 
  in the climate, wild species have three possible responses: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Change geographical distribution to track environmental changes</li>
  <li>Remain in the same place but change to match the new environment, through 
    either a plastic or genetic response [a plastic response is a reversible change 
    within an individual, such as a shift in phenology (timing of growth, budburst, 
    breeding, etc.); a genetic response is an evolutionary change within a population 
    over several generations, such as an increase in the proportion of heat-tolerant 
    individuals]</li>
  <li>Extinction.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many individual studies, careful experimental design or direct tests of 
  other possible driving factors make attribution of response to climate change 
  possible with medium to high confidence. These studies address three questions 
  (see <a href="218.htm">Sections 5.4</a> and <a href="663.htm">19.2</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are changes observed in natural systems during the 20th century in accord 
    with predictions from known effects of climate and from bioclimatic theory?</li>
  <li>Given that species, communities, and ecosystems are responding to a complex 
    function of factors, do statistical analyses identify climatic components 
    that statistically explain most of the observed change?</li>
  <li>If so, how can these results guide future predictive models of biotic response 
    to climate change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies of responses to past large-scale climatic changes during the Pleistocene 
  ice ages and the early Holocene provide a good basis for predicting biotic responses 
  to current climate change. Overwhelmingly, the most common response was for 
  a species to track the climatic change such that it maintained, more or less, 
  a species-specific climatic envelope in which it lived or bred. Typically, a 
  species' range or migratory destination shifted several hundreds of kilometers 
  with each 1&deg;C change in mean annual temperature, moving poleward and upward 
  in altitude during warming trends (Barnosky, 1986; Woodward, 1987; Goodfriend 
  and Mitterer, 1988; Davis and Zabinski, 1992; Graham, 1992; Baroni and Orombelli, 
  1994; Coope, 1995; Ashworth, 1996; Brandon-Jones, 1996). Extinctions of entire 
  species, as well as observable evolutionary shifts, were rare. Phenological 
  shifts may have occurred but cannot be detected with Pleistocene data.</p>
<p>For very mobile or migratory animals&#151;such as many birds, large mammals, 
  pelagic fish, and some insects&#151;shifts of species range occur when individuals 
  move or migration destinations change. Thus, these movements actually track 
  yearly climatic fluctuations. In contrast, most wild species, especially plants, 
  are sedentary, living their lives in a single spot because they have limited 
  mobility or because they lack behavioral mechanisms that would cause them to 
  disperse from their site of birth. Rather than occurring by individual movements, 
  range changes in sedentary species operate by the much slower process of population 
  extinctions and colonizations. Intertidal organisms represent a mix of these 
  two extremes: Adults frequently are completely sedentary, but many species have 
  free-floating planktonic larvae. The dispersal of this early life-history phase 
  is heavily governed by ocean currents. As a result, changes in distribution 
  are driven by a combination of changes in strength and pathways of currents 
  as well as general changes in sea temperature.</p>
