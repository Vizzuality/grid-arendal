<h3>8.3.1. Major Market Segments: Property/Casualty and Life/Health</h3>
<p>The world insurance market enjoyed revenues of US$2.155 trillion in 1998 (7.4% 
  of global GDP) (<a href="327.htm#tab82">Table 8-2</a>). Although insurance penetration 
  is relatively low in developing countries and economies in transition, their 
  insurance market growth rate averages approximately twice that in industrialized 
  countries. Expenditures on insurance in developing countries typically represent 
  between 0.5 and 4% of GDP, compared to 5-15% percent in developed countries 
  (Swiss Re, 1999c). With 36% of total global insurance premiums, North America 
  is the largest regional market (see <a href="545.htm">Chapter 15</a>), closely 
  followed by Western Europe at 32%. Reinsurance is particularly focused on high-value 
  loss situations, in developing countries, or for smaller primary insurers. Reinsurers 
  typically collect US$100 billion in premiums globally each year from primary 
  insurers from whom they assume various (mostly property) risks.</p>
<p>The P/C insurance segment represented 41% of global industry premiums collected 
  in 1998. As shown in <a href="329.htm#fig84">Figure 8-4</a>, the segment as 
  a whole exhibits sensitivity to major natural disaster events, as evidenced 
  by the reductions in U.S. insurer profitability during 1992 (Hurricane Andrew 
  and Iniki) and 1994 (Northridge earthquake). A list of the most costly events 
  is presented in <a href="329.htm#tab83">Table 8-3</a>. Over the past 15 years, 
  the global ratio of P/C premium income to natural catastrophe losses has decreased 
  from 351:1 to 122:1&#151;almost a three-fold rise in "exposure" (<a href="330.htm#fig85">Figure 
  8-5</a>; see <a href="577.htm#fig156">Figure 15-6</a> for North America).</p>
<p>Climate- and weather-related risks faced by life/health insurers include injuries 
  or death resulting from extreme weather episodes, water- or vector-borne diseases, 
  degraded urban air quality, pressure on the quality and adequacy of food and 
  water supplies, and increased vulnerability to power failures (see <a href="159.htm">Chapters 
  4</a>, <a href="196.htm">5</a>, <a href="347.htm">9</a>, <a href="545.htm">15</a>; 
  <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/319.htm">Chapter 8</a>; World Bank, 
  1997a; Epstein, 1999). In some areas, climate changes may yield health benefits, 
  but negative health impacts are expected to outweigh positive ones if no actions 
  are taken to adjust (<a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). Such impacts will not 
  be significant for the global financial sector in the near term, because life/heath 
  insurance penetration currently is low in developing countries; the burden will 
  fall largely on the informal and government sectors.</p>
<p>Owing to structural changes underway in the industry, the financial distinction 
  between life and P/C insurers is blurring somewhat as a result of consolidation 
  and mergers. Life insurers also are major holders of real estate and providers 
  of mortgage lending; thus, they participate as property owners in weather-related 
  property risks and may additionally assume property risk as investors in catastrophe 
  bonds or other weather derivatives.</p>
