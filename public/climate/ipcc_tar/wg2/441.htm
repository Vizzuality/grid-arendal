<h3>11.2.4. Oceanic and Coastal Ecosystems </h3>
<h4><a name="11241"></a>11.2.4.1. Oceans and Coastal Zones</h4>
<p>In line with global trends, more than half of the region's population&#151;1.7 
  billion people&#151;presently resides in the coastal zone of Asia (Middleton, 
  1999). Given the relentless and cumulative process of global environmental change 
  driven by, among other factors, demographic changes, urbanization and industrial 
  development, trade and transport demands, and lifestyle changes, the coastal 
  zones of Asia are under increasing anthropogenic pressures (Turner et al., 1996). 
  The consequences of this process pose a significant threat to environmental 
  and socioeconomic systems located in Asian coastal zones. All coastal areas 
  are facing an increasing range of stresses and shocks, the scales of which now 
  pose a threat to the resilience of human and environmental coastal systems and 
  are likely to be exacerbated by climate change.</p>
<p>Climate impacts on coastal zones of Asia include accelerated sea-level rise 
  and more frequent and severe storm events. Large populations in coastal areas 
  of southeast and south Asia are vulnerable to pressure from unsustainable resource 
  use and environmental degradation (e.g., Dow, 1999). These areas already are 
  subject to numerous climate change-related stresses, including loss of coastal 
  mangroves that act as major environmental determinants of coastal fisheries 
  (Daily, 1997; Field et al., 1998; Primavera, 1998). Major delta areas of Asia 
  are likely to be subjected to stresses associated with sea-level rise, changes 
  in water regimes, saltwater intrusion, siltation, and land loss (see <a href="283.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). Low-lying coastal cities will be at the forefront of impacts; these 
  cities include Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Jakarta, Tokyo, Manila, Bangkok, 
  Karachi, Mumbai, and Dhaka&#151;all of which have witnessed significant environmental 
  stresses in recent years. Jakarta, Bangkok, and Tianjin, for example, have experienced 
  changes in relative sea level of as much as 5 cm yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1980s and 1990s 
  as a result of subsidence associated with groundwater withdrawal (ESD-CAS, 1994; 
  Nicholls, 1995). In addition, increases in temperature can lead to increased 
  eutrophication in wetlands and freshwater supplies. </p>
<p>Tropical Asia experiences the impact of present-day climate variability associated 
  with ENSO, therefore is more prone to changes in ENSO-related impacts with global 
  climate change. The ENSO phenomenon is a major cause of year-to-year variability 
  in the number of cyclones in the Asia Pacific region (Li, 1987; Nishimori and 
  Yoshino, 1990; Lander, 1994). The numbers are higher during La Ni&ntilde;a events, 
  particularly late in the season over southeast Asia (Kelly and Adger, 2000). 
  The 1982-1983 El Ni&ntilde;o caused a decline in rainfall and associated 
  impacts over large areas, including parts of Indonesia (Salafsky, 1994, 1998; 
  Glantz, 1996). El Ni&ntilde;o events are known to have significant impacts on 
  coastal areas and water resources in southeast Asia through decreased precipitation 
  in El Ni&ntilde;o years and increased frequency of typhoons in subsequent La 
  Ni&ntilde;a years (Kelly and Adger, 2000). </p>
<p>Sea levels of interior seas in arid and semi-arid Asia have dramatically changed, 
  driven either by climatic or anthropogenic factors. The level of the Caspian 
  Sea lowered by about 4 m from 1930 to 1977; since 1978 it has begun rising (Mikhailov, 
  1998). The coastline also propagated landward by 20-40 km; 2 Mha of farming 
  land and more than 100 oil wells have been inundated. Many cities in the coastal 
  zone, such as Makhachkala and Kaspisk, are seriously damaged (Svitoch, 1997). 
  The Volga delta propagated 17 km during the period of lowering sea level but 
  has retreated 12-15 km during the period of the rise in sea level (Kasimov, 
  1997; Tian and Liu, 1999). Caspian Sea level fluctuations are attributed mainly 
  to the Volga water discharge controlled by climate anomalies in its catchment 
  area (Malinin, 1994). The Aral Sea area also reduced, from 60,000 to 28,500 
  km<sup>2</sup>, in the period 1960-1989; the exposed seabed (particularly 
  deltas) now have frequent dust and salt storms, and there are shortages of freshwater 
  (Ellis, 1990; Tian and Liu, 1999).</p>
