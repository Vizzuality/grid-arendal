<h4>5.5.3.3. Biogeographical Shifts and Land Degradation </h4>
<p><a href="202.htm">Section 5.2</a> summarizes the main outputs of recent model 
  outputs. Previous IPCC reports have documented boundary shifts in rangeland 
  vegetation with adjoining vegetation as a response to past climate changes (see, 
  e.g., Gitay and Noble, 1998). The SAR concluded that model outputs suggest significant 
  changes in the boundaries of grasslands and deserts, with expansion of warm 
  grass/shrub types and a decrease in tundra systems (Allen-Diaz, 1996). More 
  recent studies by Allen and Breshears (1998) do not support this rapid change, 
  except perhaps in cases of high drought-induced mortality. Human activities 
  are likely to affect the final changes, especially in tropical and subtropical 
  areas (Allen-Diaz, 1996; Villers-R&uacute;iz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez, 1998), 
  and will negate any gains resulting from amelioration of climate (Gitay and 
  Noble, 1998). </p>
<p>Palaeoecological evidence shows shifts in rangeland vegetation&#151;for example, 
  between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Holocene in the Sahara-Gobi desert 
  belt (Lioubimtseva et al., 1998). These shifts have resulted in changes in the 
  carbon stores. Dry and cool conditions during the LGM (about 20,000 years BP) 
  resulted in the spread of arid and semi-arid ecosystems at northern and southern 
  margins of the desert belt. The southern limit of the Sahara migrated southward 
  at least 400 km relative to its present position and almost 1,000 km southward 
  compared to the mid-Holocene (about 9,000 years BP). The northern margin of 
  the temperate deserts and dry steppes of central Asia shifted northward by about 
  300 km over Kazakhstan, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. During the last world 
  deglaciation, the Sahara-Gobi desert belt was a sink for approximately 200 Gt 
  of atmospheric carbon, but since the mid-Holocene it has been a source.</p>
<p>Modeling studies by Ni (2000), using the BIOME3 model (see <a href="202.htm">Section 
  5.2</a>) with present climate for the Tibetan Plateau and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (550 ppm), suggest that there is likely to be a large reduction in temperate 
  deserts, alpine steppe, desert, and ice/polar desert; a large increase in temperate 
  shrubland/meadow and temperate steppe; and a general poleward shift of vegetation 
  zones. Villers-R&uacute;iz and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez (1998) found that projected 
  impacts of climate change (using two climate change scenarios generated by the 
  Canadian Climate Center) would result in expansion of some rangeland systems 
  into moist forest areas in Mexico. However, under a GFDL scenario there would 
  be an increase in the distribution of tropical humid and wet forests into rangelands. 
  Zimov et al. (1995) suggest that shifts in vegetation boundaries in the rangelands 
  could be influenced by mammalian grazing (in this case, the study area did not 
  have livestock); thus, model projections should include the impact of mammal 
  populations for realistic projections of future vegetation changes (see also 
  <a href="218.htm">Section 5.4</a>). </p>
<p>Desertification tends to be associated with land degradation in rangelands 
  (Pickup, 1998). However, desertification aggregates many land degradation processes 
  and can be exacerbated by climate change. The main processes involved in land 
  degradation include physical, chemical, and biological degradation (Lal et al., 
  1989, 1999; see also <a href="209.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>) and result in 
  soil compaction, destruction of soil surfaces (which often are kept intact by 
  the presence cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses), and salinization (Dregne, 
  1995; Pickup, 1998). These processes are sensitive to livestock trampling. The 
  end result can be decreased water penetration, increased surface runoff, and 
  exposure of soils to wind and water erosion, thereby changing the water and 
  nutrient cycles (Belnap, 1995). In some cold deserts, changes to the soil surface 
  and thus water penetration are quite critical because low vegetation cover, 
  low surface rooting plants, few nitrogen fixers, and low soil temperatures result 
  in slow recovery in nutrient cycles (Belnap, 1995). Under many circumstances, 
  recovery of the soil surface in many arid and semi-arid parts of the world is 
  estimated to take several hundred years, with nitrogen-fixing capability (mostly 
  from the soil crust) taking at least 50 years&#151;making them generally vulnerable 
  to further desertification and soil degradation. </p>
<p>Land degradation is a nonlinear process with thresholds that can be triggered 
  by climatic factors and human activities (Puigdefabregas, 1998). This has implications 
  for the sensitivities and vulnerability of these systems. Villers-R&uacute;iz 
  and Trejo-V&aacute;zquez (1998) suggest that the impacts of climate change are 
  likely to be minor compared to land degradation in parts of rangelands in Mexico 
  where conversion of forests into grasslands is mainly for cattle ranching. Lavee 
  et al. (1998) suggest on the basis of field and experimental work that if climate 
  becomes more arid in Mediterranean to arid areas of Israel (through decreases 
  in annual precipitation and the frequency and intensity of precipitation, together 
  with increasing temperature), productivity would decrease&#151;leading to decreased 
  organic matter, soil permeability,and rates of infiltration and thus land degradation. 
  The rate of change of these variables along the climatic transect is nonlinear. 
  A step-like threshold exists at the semi-arid area, which sharply separates 
  the Mediterranean climate and arid systems. This means that only a relatively 
  small climatic change would be needed to shift the borders between these two 
  systems. Because many regions of Mediterranean climate lie adjacent to semi-arid 
  areas, the former are threatened by desertification in the event of climate 
  change.</p>
<p>Irrigation in semi-arid areas is a major cause of secondary (or dryland) salinity. 
  Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increases WUE, so it may reduce irrigation needs, whereas warming 
  may enhance water demand and exacerbate problems of secondary salinity (Yeo, 
  1999). Increased subsoil drainage under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may increase the risk of 
  secondary salinization and areas potentially affected (Howden et al., 1999d).</p>
<h4><a name="5534"></a>5.5.3.4. Changes in Biodiversity</h4>
<p>This subject is reviewed extensively in the SAR and the Special Report on Regional 
  Impacts of Climate Change. More recent studies mostly suggest that recently 
  observed changes in rangelands, especially animals (see <a href="218.htm">Section 
  5.4</a>), are occurring as a result of land degradation. For example, in Australia, 
  land degradation from pastoral activity as well as the impacts of introduced 
  feral mammals (goats, foxes, rabbits) has resulted in extinctions of small- 
  and medium-sized mammals (Pickup, 1998). There have been past changes in plant 
  biodiversity as a result of changes in rangeland vegetation. For example, Prieto 
  (2000), using paleorecords from eastern plains of Argentina, found that there 
  was a replacement of dry steppe by humid grasslands during the late glacial-Holocene 
  transition. The plant composition indicates a frequently disturbed habitat with 
  a lot of weedy species that did not exist in the records in previous ages.</p>
