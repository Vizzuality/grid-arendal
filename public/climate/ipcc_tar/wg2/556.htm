<h4><a name="15212"></a>15.2.1.2. Water Quality </h4>
<p>Water quality changes may be driven by changes in hydrological flowpaths in 
  a watershed that are associated with changes in patterns of precipitation and 
  evapotranspiration and changes in total flow in streams and rivers or in water 
  level or duration of ice cover in temperate lakes. In regions such as the Precambrian 
  shield, where watersheds are predicted to become drier in spring and summer, 
  concentrations of dissolved organic material reaching lakes and streams from 
  their catchments will decrease, increasing water clarity and changing physical 
  and thermal regimes by increasing average thermocline depths in small, stratified 
  lakes, for example (Snucins and Gunn, 1995; Schindler <i>et al</i>., 1996; Perez-Fuentetaja 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). In contrast, in the Great Lakes and other large lakes 
  where dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are low, thermocline depths 
  are determined by area or wind fetch and are not affected by DOC (Fee <i>et 
  al</i>., 1996). Models for the Great Lakes indicate that rapid spring warming 
  may cause shallower and steeper thermoclines (reviewed by Magnuson <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). For lakes and streams receiving flow from deep and shallow groundwater 
  sources, drier watersheds could cause the major ion chemistry to be dominated 
  more by the deep baseflow water sources (Webster <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>In several regions where warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons are 
  expected, changes in water quality will be driven by increases in primary production, 
  organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling within lake or stream ecosystems 
  (e.g., Mulholland <i>et al</i>., 1997). In the Great Lakes region, warming over 
  the past 60 years already has moved forward by an average of 3 weeks the time 
  of ice-cover breakup (ice-out), which has moved ahead the spring bloom of algal 
  growth and changed the seasonal dynamics of nutrient utilization and production 
  and decomposition of organic matter (Magnuson <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>Where streamflows and lake levels decline, water quality deterioration is likely 
  as concentrations of nutrients and contaminants from wastewater treatment, agricultural 
  and urban runoff, and direct industrial discharge increase in reduced volumes 
  of carrying waters. The extent of water quality deterioration will depend on 
  adaptations in land use, population, and water use under changing climate. Warmer 
  water temperatures may have further direct impacts on water quality&#151;for 
  example, by reducing dissolved oxygen concentrations. In the southeast, intensification 
  of the summer temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze (simultaneous high water 
  temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentrations) in many rivers and reservoirs 
  is likely to cause a loss in habitat for coolwater fish species (Mulholland 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>Changes in the characteristics of precipitation events also may affect water 
  quality, in complex ways. For example, increased incidence of heavy precipitation 
  events as predicted for the southeast may result in increased leaching and sediment 
  transport, causing greater sediment and nonpoint-source pollutant loadings to 
  watercourses (Mulholland <i>et al</i>., 1997). Because these high-flow events 
  are episodic, the associated increase in nutrient and contaminant dilution during 
  the event is not likely to offset the deleterious effects on water quality from 
  low summer flows. </p>
<p>Warmer temperatures will increase the salinity of surface waters, especially 
  lakes and reservoirs with high residence times, by increasing evaporative water 
  losses. Higher initial salinities in reservoir water will then exacerbate salinity 
  problems in irrigation return flow and degrade water quality in downstream habitats.</p>
