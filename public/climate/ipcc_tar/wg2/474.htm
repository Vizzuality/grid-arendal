<h2>12.5. Food and Fiber</h2>
<a name="1251"></a> 
<h3>12.5.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Some 60% of Australia is used for commercial agriculture (Pestana, 1993). Only 
  2% is used for broad acre and intensive crop production; 4% is sown to pastures. 
  Soil and topography are major constraints on cropping, which produces about 
  50% of the gross value of farm production&#151;the rest being divided equally 
  between meat production and livestock products such as wool and milk.</p>
<p>Russell (1988) identifies climatic "frontiers" affected by climate 
  change and interdecadal variability in rainfall&#151;namely, the inland limit 
  to agriculture (mean annual rainfall &lt;300 mm in the south and &lt;750 mm 
  in the north), the southern limit of effective summer rainfall; and the lower 
  rainfall limit of high value crops (on the order of 1,000 mm). Temperature also 
  is limiting, with some temperate crops held south of their high-temperature 
  (northern) limit, and other more tropical crops held at their low-temperature 
  (southern or high-altitude) limit. Large areas of the interior and west are 
  desert or very arid rangelands with low yields; much of this land is now returned 
  to Aboriginal management.</p>
<p>There is great interannual variability, especially in the interior and more 
  northern regions, associated mainly with ENSO, convective rainfall, and tropical 
  cyclones. Australia is known as a land of droughts and flooding rains. Secondary 
  factors such as wildfires also account for losses of fodder, animals, and farm 
  infrastructure (sheds, fences, machinery), and hail causes significant crop 
  losses. Accordingly, drought and disaster relief policies are matters of ongoing 
  concern (O'Meagher <i>et al.</i>, 1998, 2000; Pittock <i>et al.</i>, 1999), 
  as is sustainability in the face of economic pressures and global change (Abel 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p>In New Zealand, pastoral agriculture provides more than 40% of the country's 
  export earnings (Statistics New Zealand, 1998). Dairy farming is the major activity 
  in wetter areas; sheep dominate hilly and drier areas, and beef cattle are widely 
  distributed throughout the country. Pastures are highly productive&#151;composed 
  largely of introduced grass and nitrogen-fixing legume species&#151;and support 
  high stock numbers. Rainfall in New Zealand generally is not strongly seasonal, 
  but high evapotranspiration rates in the summer make pastoral agriculture in 
  the east vulnerable to largely ENSO-related variability in summer rainfall.</p>

<h3>12.5.2. Pastoral Farming</h3>
<p>Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) have summarized and updated work by Hall <i>et al.</i> (1998), 
  McKeon <i>et al.</i> (1998), and Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999a,b). They find that although CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase alone is likely to increase pasture growth, particularly in water-limited 
  environments, there also is strong sensitivity to rainfall, so that a 10% reduction 
  in rainfall would counter the effect of a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. A 20% reduction 
  in rainfall at doubled CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to reduce pasture productivity by about 
  15% and live-weight gain in cattle by 12% and substantially increase variability 
  in stocking rates, reducing farm income. The latest scenarios, which have substantial 
  reduction in rainfall in many parts of Australia, would tend to reduce productivity.</p>
<p>Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) also found that doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are likely 
  to increase the deep drainage component under pastures, which may increase the 
  risk and rates of salinization where the potential for this problem exists. 
  Doubled CO<sub>2</sub> and increased temperature would result in only limited changes in 
  C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grass distributions (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1999a).</p>
<p>In New Zealand, productivity of dairy farms might be adversely affected by 
  a southward shift of undesirable subtropical grass species, such as <i>Paspalum 
  dilatatum </i>(Campbell <i>et al.</i>, 1996). At present, <i>P. dilatatum</i> 
  is recognized as a significant component of dairy pastures in Northland, Auckland, 
  Waikato, and the Bay of Plenty. A "user-defined" management threshold 
  for the probability of finding this grass in dairy pasture is predicted by a 
  climate profile technique (Campbell and Mitchell, 1996). This can be considered 
  the point at which adaptive management changes are regarded as necessary. This 
  technique was applied with the IS92a (mid) and IS92e (high) climate change scenarios 
  and the CSIRO4 GCM pattern, using the CLIMPACTS integrated assessment model 
  (Kenny <i>et al.</i>, 1995, 2000). Results indicate a significant southward 
  shift in the probability of occurrence of <i>P. dilatatum</i> with global warming; 
  more southerly geographic thresholds are reached at later dates, but 25-30 
  years earlier with the higher emissions scenario.</p>
<p>Comprehensive assessment of the response of dairy cattle to heat stress in 
  NSW and Queensland was carried out by Davison <i>et al.</i> (1996). Physiological effects 
  of heat stress include reduced food intake, weight loss, decreased reproduction 
  rates, reduction in milk yields, increased susceptibility to parasites, and, 
  in extreme cases, collapse and death. Heat stress can be reduced by the use 
  of shade and sprinklers, and thresholds for their use can be determined. Jones 
  and Hennessy (2000) applied this adaptation to the Hunter Valley in NSW, using 
  probabilistic estimates of temperature and dewpoint changes resulting from climate 
  change for the IS92 range of scenarios to 2100. They then estimated the probabilities 
  of given milk production losses as a function of time and calculated the economic 
  benefits of provision of shade and sprinklers. They conclude that heat-stress 
  management in the region would be cost-effective. However, such adaptation may 
  not be as cost-effective in a hotter or more humid climate. </p>
<p>Howden and Turnpenny (1997) and Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999e) also have looked 
  at heat stress in beef cattle. They find that heat stress already has increased 
  significantly in subtropical Queensland over the past 40 years (where there 
  has been a warming trend) and that it will increase further with greenhouse-induced 
  global warming. They suggest a need for further selection for cattle lines with 
  greater thermoregulatory control, but they point out that this may be difficult 
  because it may not be consistent with high production potential (Finch <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1982, 1984).</p>
