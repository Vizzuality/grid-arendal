<h3>5.5.2. Major Pressures on Key Goods and Services </h3>
<p>Climate change is a pressure on key goods and services in a system that is 
  responsive to climatic fluctuations. It is possible that climate change would 
  lead to increased frequency of extremes of climatic events (such as drought 
  and floods) driven through change in the frequency of ENSO events. Apart from 
  climate change, other direct and indirect pressures from human activities can 
  be important in the delivery of services from rangelands. These pressures include 
  land-use change, which often leads to fragmentation (Allen-Diaz, 1996; Gitay 
  and Noble, 1998; WRI, 2000); changes in the densities of livestock (WRI, 2000); 
  competition for land and water; and altered fire regimes (Russell-Smith et al., 
  1997). These pressures would have subsequent impacts that cannot be disaggregated 
  from impacts of climate change.</p>
<h3><a name="553"></a>5.5.3. Responses of Rangelands and Impacts on Goods and 
  Services </h3>
<p>It has been suggested that for rangelands the possible effect of climate change 
  may be trivial compared with the past and present impacts of human activities, 
  including livestock grazing (Le Hou&eacute;rou, 1996). This may not be entirely 
  true for all rangelands, but it does suggest that it would be difficult to separate 
  the impacts of climate change from the impacts of many of the other pressures 
  that are acting and will continue to act on the system. Subsequent sections 
  assess the direct impacts of climate change; impacts from other aspects of global 
  change, especially the pressures listed above, also are assessed (see <a href="#box59">Box 
  5-9</a>). Major impacts of climate change on key goods and services are mediated 
  through changes in NPP; changes in plant community composition, structure, and 
  forage quality (e.g., through changes in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants); 
  and changes in plant herbivory and phenology.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 5-9. Impacts of Some Pressures on Rangelands 
        </b> </div>
      <p><i>Land-Use Change</i></p>
      <p>Major factors in land-use change are conversion of rangelands to croplands 
        (Allen-Diaz, 1996; WRI, 2000) and increased human settlements, especially 
        urbanization (Gitay and Noble, 1998), which lead to fragmentation (WRI, 
        2000). There have been large-scale changes in land use: For example, in 
        the South Platte Basin in the United States, 40% of the land cover has 
        been converted from rangelands to croplands. This can alter carbon stores, 
        sometimes leading to soil carbon loss of as much as 50% (Allen-Diaz, 1996), 
        but it also can lead to increased plant productivity through irrigated 
        grain production (Baron et al., 1998). Baron et al. (1998) conclude that 
        subsequent impacts on the biogeochemical cycles of the basin and on land-atmosphere 
        interactions can affect many rangelands. In many rangelands, native species 
        that occur at low density are used for fuelwood. In some cases, fuelwood 
        collection can lead to decreases in woody vegetation cover and possible 
        land degradation. </p>
      <p><i>Livestock Production</i></p>
      <p>Some rangelands have high densities (&gt;100 km<sup>-2</sup>) of livestock, 
        with livestock being moved to take advantage of the periodic growth, especially 
        after rain and/or fires (WRI, 2000). Modeling studies show that increased 
        grazing pressure (i.e., overgrazing) would cause grass and herbaceous 
        productivity to fall below a certain threshold, resulting in increased 
        and rapid rates of land degradation especially under drier and/or hotter 
        climate conditions (Abel, 1997). </p>
      <p><i>Competition for Land and Water</i></p>
      <p>There is increased demand for water for direct human consumption and 
        for irrigation (WRI, 2000). Food production obviously is positively affected 
        by increased water use (see <a href="208.htm">Section 5.3</a> and <a href="159.htm">Chapter 
        4</a>), but this water use is an added pressure on many rangeland ecosystems. 
        Nomadic pastoralism, which was common in many rangelands until recently, 
        allowed pastoralists to cope with the variable climate of the rangelands 
        they inhabited. Land-use changes (to permanent agriculture, urban areas, 
        conservation, and game reserves that have included loss of sources of 
        permanent water) have led to overall loss of land available. Together 
        with increased human population, this has led to competition for land 
        and changes from pastoral communities to more market-orientated and cash-based 
        economies (Allen-Diaz, 1996).</p>
      <p><i>Altered Fire Regimes</i></p>
      <p>The SAR did an extensive review of fires and rangelands. The projected 
        increase in variability in climate led to the conclusion that the frequency 
        and severity of fires will increase in rangelands (Allen-Diaz, 1996), 
        provided that drought and grazing do not lead to a reduction in vegetation 
        biomass. There is historical evidence that fire frequency has changed 
        (increased and decreased, depending on vegetation biomass) in recent decades 
        (see, e.g., Russell-Smith et al., 1997), leading to changes in vegetation 
        composition. Fires also are started by humans; for example, in Africa 
        25-80% of rangelands are burned every year, often to induce new plant 
        growth (WRI, 2000). This has implications for short-term productivity 
        but possibly long-term land degradation.</p>
