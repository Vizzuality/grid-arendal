<h3>10.2.3. Natural Resource Management and Biodiversity</h3>
<h4><a name="10231"></a>10.2.3.1. Forest and Woodland Resources</h4>
<p>In Africa, forests&#151;as defined and reported by FAO (1999a)&#151;cover 5 
  million km<sup>2</sup>, one-sixth of the continent's land area. The moist 
  tropical forests of the Congo constitute the second most extensive rainforest 
  in the world and a globally important reserve of carbon. Trees and shrubs constitute 
  an important component of the more than 12 million km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural 
  lands, pastures, shrublands, and savannas outside of closed-canopy forest areas.</p>
<p>Trees and shrubs provide ecosystem services of carbon sequestration, storing 
  and transpiring water required for precipitation, maintaining soil fertility, 
  and forming habitats for a diverse array of plant and animal species. Moreover, 
  forest and woodland species also provide firewood, structural timber, traditional 
  medicines, staple foods, and drought emergency foods. Because a large fraction 
  of the population lives in rural areas, they depend on trees and shrubs for 
  many of their subsistence needs. Indeed, firewood and charcoal provide approximately 
  70% of the energy used in Africa. Moreover, the export of timber, nuts, fruit, 
  gum, and other forest products generates 6% of the economic product of African 
  countries (FAO, 1999a). Thus, climate change renders vulnerable the large part 
  of the African population that is dependent on forest species for subsistence 
  needs and the nontrivial fraction of the economy that is based on forest products.</p>
<p>Because climate change alters the spatial and temporal patterns of temperature 
  and precipitation, the two most fundamental factors determining the distribution 
  and productivity of vegetation&#151;geographical shifts in the ranges of individual 
  species and changes in productivity&#151;constitute the most likely impacts 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate change on forest species. Research in Senegal 
  (Gonzalez, 1997, 2001) has documented retraction of mesic species to areas of 
  higher rainfall and lower temperature as a result of desertification in the 
  last half of the 20th century. These changes have caused a 25-30 km southwest 
  shift of Sahel, Sudan, and Guinean vegetation zones in half a century, proceeding 
  at an average rate of 500-600 m yr<sup>-1</sup>&#151;foreshadowing the 
  magnitude of projected vegetation shifts driven by CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate 
  change (Davis and Zabinski, 1992). In northwest Senegal, the human population 
  density is 45 people km<sup>-2</sup>, whereas forest species can support only 
  13 people km<sup>-2</sup> under altered conditions (Gonzalez, 1997).</p>
<p>Dry woodlands and savannas in semi-arid and subhumid areas will be increasingly 
  subjected to drying in the next century, as well as increasing land-use intensity&#151;including 
  conversion to agriculture (Desanker <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Moreover, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced 
  climate change is very likely to alter the frequency, intensity, seasonality, 
  and extent of vegetation fires that are critical to the maintenance of areas 
  such as the Serengeti grasslands of east Africa, the miombo woodlands of southern 
  Africa, and the fynbos of the Cape. Across the continent, farmers traditionally 
  use fire to clear agricultural fields in forest areas and areas outside closed-canopy 
  forest; pastoralists and hunter-gatherers use fire to improve the quality of 
  plant resources available during the dry season. Satellite remote sensing reveals 
  that more than half of the continent experiences a fire regime with a frequency 
  greater than once per decade (Kendall <i>et al.,</i> 1997; Levine <i>et al.,</i> 
  1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Although the broad geographical pattern of fire-prone vegetation clearly is 
  climatically related (van Wilgen and Scholes, 1997), the aspect of the fire 
  regime that is most sensitive to the type and degree of climate change suggested 
  for Africa is likely to be fire intensity, rather than its frequency or extent. 
  Fire intensity is related largely to the available dry-season fuel load, which 
  in turn is strongly and positively related to rainfall in the preceding wet 
  season and nonlinearly related to woody plant cover. In the miombo woodlands, 
  it is predicted that increased fire will expand savanna areas at the expense 
  of wooded areas (Desanker <i>et al.,</i> 1997). Because emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> precursors, and aerosols from vegetation fires in 
  Africa constitute a significant contribution to the global budgets of these 
  species (Crutzen and Andreae, 1990; Hao <i>et al.,</i> 1990; Scholes <i>et al.,</i> 
  1996), changes in the African fire regime could have consequences for global 
  and regional climate.</p>
<p>Modeling of the distribution of forest species on the basis of the Holdridge 
  (1967) life zone classification has projected changes from mesic vegetation 
  to xeric vegetation in Tanzania and The Gambia (Jallow and Danso, 1997) but 
  a shift from arid vegetation to moist vegetation in Mozambique (Bila, 1999). 
  It is not suggested that vegetation formations and their associated fauna (biomes) 
  will migrate as a unit. It is more likely that species will respond to changing 
  climate and disturbance regimes individualistically, with substantial time lags 
  and periods of reorganization. The broad pattern of productive potential of 
  vegetation zones is likely to move with greater spatial integrity because there 
  is a degree of functional redundancy in ecosystems.</p>
<p>The most promising adaptation strategies to declining tree resources include 
  natural regeneration of local species, energy-efficient cookstoves, sustainable 
  forest management, and community-based natural resource management. The most 
  effective adaptation to the decline of trees and shrubs in semi-arid areas is 
  natural regeneration of local species. In addition, the <i>ban ak suuk</i> cookstove 
  in Senegal and the <i>jiko</i> ceramic stove in Kenya have both produced energy-efficient 
  gains in semi-arid areas (Dutt and Ravindranath, 1993). These practices generally 
  depend on the ability of local people to exercise power to inventory and manage 
  local resources in systems of community-based natural resource management. Decentralization 
  of decisionmaking and revenue allocation authority has promoted efficient forest 
  management in small areas of Niger, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe (FAO, 1999a). All 
  of these practices constitute "no regrets" strategies that society 
  would want to undertake under any climate scenario for their intrinsic environmental 
  and economic benefits.</p>
