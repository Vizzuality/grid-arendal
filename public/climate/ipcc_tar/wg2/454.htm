<h3>11.3.2. Regional and Sectoral Strategies </h3>
<p>Regions of the Asian continent differ widely in their biophysical characteristics 
  hence in their physical vulnerability to climate change. Different regions also 
  experience highly differentiated social vulnerability. Adaptation strategies 
  therefore will be differentiated across regions and sectors, depending on their 
  vulnerability profiles. In the following subsections, vulnerabilities and related 
  adaptation strategies are discussed for four broad regions of Asia and for selected 
  sectors. </p>
<h4><a name="11321"></a>11.3.2.1. Boreal Asia</h4>
<p>At present, only areas of sporadic permafrost are used for agriculture. Global 
  warming should play a positive role for agriculture in boreal Asia. The growing 
  season is likely to expand by 1-1.5 months by 2100. The increase in mean 
  monthly air temperatures during the summer will increase active soil temperatures. 
  In addition, winter air temperatures will substantially increase (Sirotenko 
  et al., 1997). Shifts in the limit of the permafrost zone to the north, formation 
  of vast areas of perennial ground thawing, and better soil climate will contribute 
  to a northward shift of agriculture boundary. The key step for an agriculture 
  adaptation strategy could be the choice of suitable crops and cultivars. Shifts 
  in sowing date of spring crops will allow more effective use of the soil moisture 
  content formed by snow melting. The dates of spring crop sowing could be moved 
  forward in a crop rotation calendar in southern regions, and farmers could plant 
  a second crop that could even be vegetable with a short growth period (Laverov, 
  1998). Optimum use of fertilizers and ecologically clean agrotechnologies would 
  be beneficial for agriculture. </p>
<p>Climate change has the potential to exacerbate water resource stresses in some 
  areas but ameliorate them in most parts of boreal Asia. The increase in surface 
  temperatures will have considerable effect on the timing of snowmelt hence the 
  timing of the flow regime (Arnell, 1999). Diversions of water systems would 
  adversely impact fisheries and fishery habitat in the region (Rozengurt, 1991). 
  A decrease in water flow during the dry summer season is likely in some parts 
  of boreal Asia. Extraction of groundwaters from deep aquifers has been proposed 
  as an option, keeping in view the likely surface water quality deterioration 
  during dry periods (Laverov, 1998). It would be necessary to increase the capacity 
  of recycled water supply systems and autonomous water-use systems. However, 
  even with water-saving measures it may be necessary to cut water intake for 
  industry needs during dry periods to meet increasing demand in the future. Bottom-deepening 
  along navigation channels may be required to facilitate the transport of goods 
  and material through rivers.</p>
