<h2>3.5. Human Health </h2>
<p>The impacts of short-term weather events on human health have been further 
  elucidated since the SAR, particularly in relation to periods of thermal stress, 
  the modulation of air pollution impacts, the impacts of storms and floods, and 
  the influences of seasonal and interannual climatic variability on infectious 
  diseases. There has been increased understanding of the determinants of population 
  vulnerability to adverse health impacts and the possibilities for adaptive responses. 
  [<a href="037.htm">4.7</a>]</p>
<p>Many vector-, food-, and water-borne infectious diseases are known to be sensitive 
  to changes in climatic conditions. From results of most predictive model studies, 
  there is medium to high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
  that, under climate change scenarios, there would be a net increase in the geographic 
  range of potential transmission of malaria and dengue-two vector-borne 
  infections each of which currently impinge on 40-50% of the world population.<a href="fnspm.htm#10" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  Within their present ranges, these and many other infectious diseases would 
  tend to increase in incidence and seasonality-although regional decreases 
  would occur in some infectious diseases. In all cases, however, actual disease 
  occurrence is strongly influenced by local environmental conditions, socioeconomic 
  circumstances, and public health infrastructure. [<a href="037.htm">4.7</a>]</p>
<p>Projected climate change will be accompanied by an increase in heat waves, 
  often exacerbated by increased humidity and urban air pollution, which would 
  cause an increase in heat-related deaths and illness episodes. The evidence 
  indicates that the impact would be greatest in urban populations, affecting 
  particularly the elderly, sick, and those without access to air-conditioning 
  (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  Limited evidence indicates that in some temperate countries reduced winter deaths 
  would outnumber increased summer deaths (medium confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>); 
  yet, published research has been largely confined to populations in developed 
  countries, thus precluding a generalized comparison of changes in summer and 
  winter mortality. [<a href="029.htm">3.5</a> and <a href="037.htm">4.7</a>]</p>
<p>Extensive experience makes clear that any increase in flooding will increase 
  the risk of drowning, diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases, and, in developing 
  countries, hunger and malnutrition (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  If cyclones were to increase regionally, devastating impacts would often occur, 
  particularly in densely settled populations with inadequate resources. A reduction 
  in crop yields and food production because of climate change in some regions, 
  particularly in the tropics, will predispose food-insecure populations to malnutrition, 
  leading to impaired child development and decreased adult activity. Socioeconomic 
  disruptions could occur in some regions, impairing both livelihoods and health. 
  [<a href="029.htm">3.5</a>, <a href="031.htm#41">4.1</a>, <a href="032.htm">4.2</a>, 
  <a href="035.htm">4.5</a>, and <a href="037.htm">4.7</a>]</p>
<p>For each anticipated adverse health impact there is a range of social, institutional, 
  technological, and behavioral adaptation options to lessen that impact. Adaptations 
  could, for example, encompass strengthening of the public health infrastructure, 
  health-oriented management of the environment (including air and water quality, 
  food safety, urban and housing design, and surface water management), and the 
  provision of appropriate medical care facilities. Overall, the adverse health 
  impacts of climate change will be greatest in vulnerable lower income populations, 
  predominantly within tropical/subtropical countries. Adaptive policies would, 
  in general, reduce these impacts. [<a href="037.htm">4.7</a>]</p>
