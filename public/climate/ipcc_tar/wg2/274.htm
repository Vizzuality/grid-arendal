<h4>5.8.3.2. Carbon Sink </h4>
<p>It has been suggested that water-level drawdown and increased temperature will 
  decrease carbon sequestration in subarctic and boreal peatlands, especially 
  in more southern latitudes (Gorham, 1991). However, conclusions are hampered 
  by the diversity of possible responses. </p>
<p>Impacts of climate change on wetland carbon sink can be measured directly by 
  using the eddy covariance method or chamber techniques (Crill et al., 1988; 
  Fowler et al., 1995; Alm et al., 1997b; Aurela et al., 1998) and modeling the 
  balances (Frolking et al., 1998). In recent years, several high quality, continuous, 
  snow-free season time series of net ecosystem exchange have been obtained for 
  wetlands and peatlands in the subarctic zone (Burton et al., 1996; Friborg et 
  al., 1997; Schreader et al., 1998), the boreal zone (Shurpali et al., 1995; 
  Jarvis et al., 1997; Kelly et al., 1997; Lafleur et al., 1997; Roulet et al., 
  1997; Suyker et al., 1997; Goulden et al., 1998), and the temperate zone (Happell 
  and Chanton, 1993; Pulliam, 1993). Extrapolations of temporally detailed enclosure 
  measurements along with estimates of the export of DOC have been undertaken 
  to derive peatland carbon balances (Waddington and Roulet, 1996; Carroll and 
  Crill, 1997). These studies point out the difficulty of assessing the sink/source 
  strength of a peatland within a reasonable level of certainty because of errors 
  introduced in the scaling process (Waddington and Roulet, 2000).</p>
<p>For northern peatlands, much is known about the effects of water-level drawdown 
  on the carbon balance, based on studies carried out in peatlands drained for 
  forestry (Glenn et al., 1993; Roulet et al., 1993; Laine et al., 1995; Martikainen 
  et al., 1995; Minkkinen and Laine, 1998). These studies may be used cautiously 
  to represent the climate change impact because the effect of drainage on ecosystem 
  structure and functioning is similar to that predicted after drying caused by 
  climate change in northern latitudes (Laine et al., 1996). The change observed 
  in vegetation structure after water-level drawdown directs biomass production 
  to the shrub and tree layer; in most cases, primary production and biomass increased 
  (Laiho and Fin&eacute;r, 1996; Laiho and Laine, 1997; Sharitz and Gresham, 1998). 
  Simultaneously, litter production increased (Laiho and Fin&eacute;r, 1996; Laiho 
  and Laine, 1997; Fin&eacute;r and Laine, 1998), and the litter was more resistant 
  to decomposition (Meentemeyer, 1984; Berg et al., 1993; Couteaux et al., 1998). 
  There is some evidence that part of the carbon from decomposing litter is stored 
  in the peat profile down to 0.5-m depth (Domisch et al., 1998). These alterations 
  to vegetation production and litter flow into soil have been observed to keep 
  the net carbon accumulation rate into the soil of boreal bogs in most cases 
  at the level prior to water-level drawdown, sometimes exceeding this level (Minkkinen 
  and Laine, 1998). However, increased duration and shortened return periods of 
  extreme droughts may have detrimental effects on the peat carbon balance, as 
  indicated by the results of Alm et al. (1997b).</p>
<p>Water-level drawdown will cause a decrease in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions as substrate 
  flux to anoxic layers is decreased and consumption of CH<sub>4</sub> in the 
  thicker aerobic layer is enhanced (Glenn et al., 1993; Roulet et al., 1993; 
  Martikainen et al., 1995; Roulet and Moore, 1995). It has been suggested that 
  reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions after water-level drawdown, together with an 
  increase in tree biomass and a fairly small change in carbon sequestration into 
  peat, may even decrease the greenhouse effect of these ecosystems (Laine et 
  al., 1996).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not immediately clear that a warmer, drier climate necessarily 
  will lead to a large loss of stored peat for all peatland types. The feedback 
  between climate and peatland hydrology and the autogenic nature of peatland 
  development is poorly understood. Clymo (1984) first developed this idea, and 
  it has recently been used to show how surface topography on peatlands is preserved 
  (Belyea and Clymo, 1999). Hilbert et al. (1998) have expanded on the work of 
  Clymo (1984) and developed a model of peatland growth that explicitly incorporates 
  hydrology and feedbacks between moisture storage and peatland production and 
  decomposition. Their studies suggest that some peatland types (e.g., most bogs) 
  will adjust relatively quickly to perturbations in moisture storage.</p>
<p>Future rates of carbon sequestration in swamps on mineral soils will depend 
  largely on the response of trees to changes in hydrology, temperature, and elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The aboveground productivity of temperate zone swamp forests 
  is strongly regulated by the extent of soil saturation and flooding, and the 
  long-term effect of changes in hydrology on growth will depend on the position 
  of forests along the current hydrological gradient (Megonigal et al., 1997). 
  Drier conditions may increase NPP on extensively flooded sites and decrease 
  it on dry and intermediate sites.</p>
<p>The combination of high soil carbon density and rapid warming in peatlands 
  underlain by permafrost have raised concerns that northern peatlands may become 
  net carbon sources rather than sinks (Lal et al., 2000). Indeed, working in 
  tussock and wet tundra, Oechel et al. (1993) estimate that these systems are 
  now net sources of 0.19 Gt C, caused mainly by melting of permafrost and lowering 
  of the water table. Botch et al. (1995) report that peatlands of the former 
  Soviet Union are net sources of 0.07 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Other parts of the 
  boreal zone may have become enhanced sinks as a result of recent warming (Myneni 
  et al., 1997), and continued warming could change the equation to favor net 
  carbon storage&#151;as suggested by warming experiments in arctic ecosystems 
  (Hobbie, 1996).</p>
<p>Higher temperatures may affect carbon cycling of other wetlands as well. Increased 
  photosynthetic activity of deep-rooted wetland plants, such as sedges, may enhance 
  substrate availability for methanogenesis&#151;which, together with higher temperatures, 
  might lead to higher CH<sub>4</sub> emissions (Valentine et al., 1994; Bergman 
  et al., 1998; Segers, 1998) where water level would remain near the soil surface.</p>
<p>Land uses such as agriculture and forestry always change carbon fluxes in ecosystems. 
  High carbon losses have been reported for agricultural crop production on drained 
  wetland in Europe and North America, as much as 10-20 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Armentano and Menges, 1986). Studies have shown that agriculture 
  on peat soils may contribute significantly to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) 
  emission (Nyk&auml;nen et al., 1995a). Kasimir-Klemedtsson et al., (1997) conclude 
  that agricultural practices on organic soils lead to a net increase in emissions 
  of GHGs because of large fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, over decreases 
  in emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>As agricultural management fundamentally alters the processes of wetlands and 
  gradually leads to decreases in wetland area (Okruszko, 1996). Large areas of 
  wetlands have been lost in Russia, Europe, and North America by complete drainage 
  and conversion to other land uses. It has been estimated that 53% of the original 
  89 Mha of wetlands in the coterminous United States were lost by the 1980s (Shepard 
  et al., 1998), much of it to agricultural conversion. Development for agriculture 
  also can have offsite effects&#151;for example, reduced water quality that impacts 
  fisheries (Notohadiprawiro, 1998). Arable agriculture always transforms wetlands 
  into sources of GHGs to the atmosphere (Armentano and Menges, 1986; Okruszko, 
  1996), with the exception of CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>Consequences of the development of tropical peatlands include lowering of the 
  water table, which promotes peat oxidation and decomposition. Peat loss and 
  subsidence can occur at very fast rates&#151;as much as 0.9 cm per month (Dradjad 
  et al., 1986). Eventually, shrinkage and oxidation may lead to loss of the entire 
  peat profile and exposure of underlying nutrient-poor substrates or potential 
  acid sulphate soils (Maltby et al., 1996; Rieley et al., 1996). In subcoastal 
  situations, this may be followed by marine inundation.</p>
<p>When wetland use for forestry involves only management of existing tree stands, 
  the impacts on functions and processes may be small, and the ecosystem may remain 
  within the wetland concept (Aust and Lea, 1991; Minkkinen et al., 1999). However, 
  if artificial drainage is included, decay of organic matter is enhanced, with 
  consequent increases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from peat (Glenn et al., 1993; 
  Silvola et al., 1996). The results of the carbon balance change reported are 
  highly variable, depending on methods used and climatological differences. Losses 
  of peat carbon have been reported by Braekke and Finer (1991) and Sakovets and 
  Germanova (1992), whereas increased post-drainage carbon stores have been reported 
  by Anderson et al. (1992) and Vompersky et al. (1992). Based on a large cross-sectional 
  data set from forest drainage areas in Finland, it was shown that carbon accumulation 
  in peat soil increased in southern parts of the country (annual mean temperature 
  3-4.5&deg;C) but decreased in northern Finland (with mean temperature of 
  0-1&deg;C). The carbon accumulation increase was clearest for nutrient-poor 
  bog sites (Minkkinen and Laine, 1998). Cannell and Dewar (1995) have concluded 
  that drainage and planting of conifers on organic soils produces little long-term 
  change in soil carbon stores because enhanced organic matter oxidation is compensated 
  by increased litter production of the tree stand.</p>
<p>Water-level drawdown after drainage decreases CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from 
  peatland (Glenn et al., 1993; Roulet et al., 1993; Martikainen et al., 1995; 
  Roulet and Moore, 1995). Increased consumption in the surface soil may even 
  form a small CH<sub>4</sub> sink in some cases (Glenn et al., 1993; Roulet et 
  al., 1993; Fowler et al., 1995; Martikainen et al., 1995; Roulet and Moore, 
  1995; Komulainen et al., 1998). The effect of drainage on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions 
  has been reported to be fairly small and restricted to fen sites (Martikainen 
  et al., 1993).</p>
<p>Forest harvesting in tropical swamp forests can result in changes to the quality 
  and quantity of organic matter inputs from vegetation, and&#151;as the work 
  of Brady (1997) has shown&#151;if tree root mats decline, net accumulation of 
  peat also may decline. Where selective logging is combined with artificial drainage, 
  decomposition and subsidence of peat may proceed at rates of 3.5&#151;6.0 cm 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Brady, 1997). In contrast with peatlands of the temperate and 
  boreal zone, there has been poor success with establishing forestry plantations 
  on tropical peatlands.</p>
<p>Peat harvesting totally changes the structure and functioning of the original 
  ecosystem by removing the vegetation and finally most of the accumulated peat 
  deposit. This has a fundamental impact on the GHG balances of harvesting sites: 
  CH<sub>4</sub> emissions almost stop (Nyk&auml;nen et al., 1995b), but the whole 
  accumulated carbon store forms a CO<sub>2</sub> source to the atmosphere during 
  harvesting and combustion (Rodhe and Svensson, 1995), even if peat combustion 
  may replace imported energy in countries with no other major domestic energy 
  sources. </p>
<p>Recent findings have shown that restoration of cut-away peatlands after harvesting 
  soon initiates colonization of peatland plants (Smart et al., 1989; Tuittila 
  and Komulainen, 1995; Campeau and Rochefort, 1996; Wheeler, 1996; Wind-Mulder 
  et al., 1996; Ferland and Rochefort, 1997; LaRose et al., 1997; Price et al., 
  1998) and may restart carbon accumulation (Tuittila et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to stimulate CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in a wide variety 
  of wetland ecosystems, including freshwater marshes (Megonigal and Schlesinger, 
  1997) and rice paddies (Ziska et al., 1998). Studies in northern peatlands have 
  been equivocal: One study reports a maximum increase of 250% (Hutchin et al., 
  1995) and another no increase (Saarnio et al., 1998). Because CH<sub>4</sub> 
  is a more powerful GHG than CO<sub>2</sub>, wetlands amplify the greenhouse effect of elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> by converting a portion of this gas to CH<sub>4</sub>.<br>
  Increased nitrogen deposition may alter the species composition of wetland communities 
  (Aerts et al., 1992) and their production, leading to higher production and 
  net accumulation rates in peatlands where production is nitrogen limited (Aerts 
  et al., 1995). There is some indication that nitrogen inputs may affect trace 
  gas emissions from peat soils by increasing emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and 
  sometimes decreasing those of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> (Aerts, 1997; Aerts and 
  Ludwig, 1997; Aerts and Toet, 1997; Regina et al., 1998).</p>
