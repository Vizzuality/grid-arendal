<h3>3.3.3. Types of Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Scenarios</h3>
<h4><a name="3331"></a>3.3.3.1. Driving Forces of Change</h4>
<p>In early studies, the consequences of LUC often were portrayed in terms of 
  the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from tropical deforestation. Early carbon cycle 
  models used prescribed deforestation rates and emission factors to project future 
  emissions. During the past decade, a more comprehensive view has emerged, embracing 
  the diversity of driving forces and regional heterogeneity (Turner <i>et al</i>., 
  1995). Currently, most driving forces of available LUC-LCC scenarios are derived 
  from population, income, and agricultural productivity assumptions. The first 
  two factors commonly are assumed to be exogenous variables (i.e., scenario assumptions), 
  whereas productivity levels are determined dynamically. This simplification 
  does not yet characterize all diverse local driving forces, but it can be an 
  effective approximation at coarser levels (Turner <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<h4><a name="3332"></a>3.3.3.2. Processes of LUC-LCC</h4>
<p>The central role of LUC-LCC in determining climate change and its impacts has 
  not fully been explored in the development of scenarios. Only limited aspects 
  are considered. Most scenarios emphasize arable agriculture and neglect pastoralism, 
  forestry, and other land uses. Only a few IAMs have begun to include more aspects 
  of land use. Most scenarios discriminate between urban and rural population, 
  each characterized by its specific needs and land uses. Demand for agricultural 
  products generally is a function of income and regional preferences. With increasing 
  wealth, there could be a shift from grain-based diets toward more affluent meat-based 
  diets. Such shifts strongly alter land use (Leemans, 1999). Similar functional 
  relations are assumed to determine the demand for nonfood products. Potential 
  productivity is determined by climatic, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and soil 
  conditions. Losses resulting from improper management, limited water and nutrient 
  availability, pests and diseases, and pollutants decrease potential productivity 
  (Penning de Vries <i>et al</i>., 1997). Most models assume constant soil conditions. 
  In reality, many land uses lead to land degradation that alters soil conditions, 
  affecting yields and changing land use (Barrow, 1991). Agricultural management, 
  including measures for yield enhancement and protection, defines actual productivity. 
  Unfortunately, management is demonstrably difficult to represent in scenarios.</p>
<p>Most attempts to simulate LUC-LCC patterns combine productivity calculations 
  and demand for land-use products. In this step, large methodological difficulties 
  emerge. To satisfy increased demand, agricultural land uses in some regions 
  intensify (i.e., increase productivity), whereas in others they expand in area. 
  These processes are driven by different local, regional, and global factors. 
  Therefore, subsequent LCC patterns and their spatial and temporal dynamics cannot 
  be determined readily. For example, deforestation is caused by timber extraction 
  in Asia but by conversion to pasture in Latin America. Moreover, land-cover 
  conversions rarely are permanent. Shifting cultivation is a common practice 
  in some regions, but in many other regions agricultural land also has been abandoned 
  in the past (Foster <i>et al</i>., 1998) or is abandoned regularly (Skole and 
  Tucker, 1993). These complex LUC-LCC dynamics make the development of comprehensive 
  scenarios a challenging task. </p>
<p>The outcome of LUC-LCC scenarios is land-cover change. For example, the IMAGE 
  scenarios (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1998b) illustrate some of the complexities 
  in land-cover dynamics. Deforestation continues globally until 2050, after which 
  the global forested area increases again in all regions except Africa and Asia. 
  Pastures expand more rapidly than arable land, with large regional differences. 
  One of the important assumptions in these scenarios is that biomass will become 
  an important energy source. This requires additional cultivated land. </p>
<h4><a name="3333"></a>3.3.3.3. Adaptation</h4>
<p>Adaptation is considered in many scenarios that are used to estimate future 
  agricultural productivity. Several studies (Rosenberg, 1993; Rosenzweig and 
  Parry, 1994; Brown and Rosenberg, 1999; Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999) assume 
  changes in crop selection and management and conclude that climate change impacts 
  decrease when available measures are implemented. Reilly <i>et al</i>. (1996) 
  conclude that the agricultural sector is not very vulnerable because of its 
  adaptive capability. However, Risbey <i>et al</i>. (1999) warn that this capability 
  is overestimated because it assumes rapid diffusion of information and technologies.</p>
<p>In contrast, most impact studies on natural ecosystems draw attention to the 
  assumed fact that LCC will increase the vulnerability of natural systems (Peters 
  and Lovejoy, 1992; Huntley <i>et al</i>., 1997). For example, Sala <i>et al</i>. 
  (2000) use scenarios of LUC-LCC, climate, and other factors to assess future 
  threats to biodiversity in different biomes. They explicitly address a biome's 
  adaptive capacity and find that the dominant factors that determine biodiversity 
  decline will be climate change in polar biomes and land use in tropical biomes. 
  The biodiversity of other biomes is affected by a combination of factors, each 
  influencing vulnerability in a different way.</p>
