<h2>9.8. Coastal Water Issues </h2>
<p>Pathogens often are found in coastal waters; transmission occurs though shellfish 
  consumption or bathing. Coastal waters in developed and developing countries 
  frequently are contaminated with untreated sewage. Higher temperatures encourage 
  microorganism proliferation. The presence of Vibrio spp. (some of which are 
  pathogens that cause diarrhea) has been associated with higher sea-surface temperature 
  (SST) (Lipp and Rose, 1997). Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring estuarine 
  bacterium that may be more often transmitted to humans under conditions of higher 
  SST (Patz <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Acute poisoning can occur following consumption of fish and shellfish contaminated 
  with biotoxins (WHO, 1984). Phytoplankton organisms respond rapidly to changes 
  in environmental conditions and therefore are sensitive biological indicators 
  of the combined influences of climate change and environmental change (Harvell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Algal blooms are associated with several environmental factors, 
  including sunlight, pH, ocean currents, winds, SSTs, and runoff (which affects 
  nutrient levels) (Epstein <i>et al</i>., 1993; NRC, 1999). Algal blooms can be harmful 
  to fish and other aquatic life, often causing severe economic damage, and are 
  reported to have increased globally in the past several decades (Hallegraeff, 
  1993; Sournia, 1995), although some of the observed increase is attributed to 
  changes in monitoring, effluent, and land use. <br>
</p>
<p>There is no straightforward relationship between the presence of an algal bloom 
  and an outbreak of poisoning. Human poisoning can occur in the absence of a 
  bloom. Two main types of biotoxin poisoning are associated with temperate climates 
  and colder coastal waters: paralytic shellfish poisoning and diarrheic shellfish 
  poisoning. If water temperatures rise as a result of climate change, shifts 
  in the distribution of these diseases could follow. Biotoxins associated with 
  warmer waters, such as ciguatera in tropical waters, could extend their range 
  to higher latitudes (Tester, 1994). An association has been found between ciguatera 
  (fish poisoning) and SST in some Pacific islands (Hales <i>et al</i>., 1999a). <br>
</p>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that species of copepod zooplankton provide a marine 
  reservoir for the cholera pathogen and facilitate its long-term persistence 
  in certain regions, such as the estuaries of the Ganges and Bramaputra in Bangladesh 
  (Colwell, 1996). The seasonality of cholera epidemics may be linked to the seasonality 
  of plankton (algal blooms) and the marine food chain. Studies using remote-sensing 
  data have shown a correlation between cholera cases and SST in the Bay of Bengal 
  (Lobitz <i>et al</i>., 2000). Interannual variability in cholera incidence in Bangladesh 
  also is linked to ENSO and regional temperature anomalies (Pascual <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Epidemiological evidence further suggests a widespread environmental cause of 
  the 1991 epidemic in Peru, rather than point-source contamination (Seas <i>et al</i>., 
  2001). There is some evidence for a link between warmer sea surfaces and cholera 
  risk in the Bay of Bengal, but it is not possible to extrapolate such findings 
  to cholera incidence inland or in other regions. The potential impact of long-term 
  climate warming on cholera incidence or risk of epidemics remains uncertain. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Climate-related ecological changes may enhance primary and secondary transmission 
  of cholera in developing countries, particularly among populations settled in 
  low-lying coastal areas in the tropics. However, the causal link between sea 
  temperature, plankton blooms, and human disease requires further elucidation 
  and confirmation.</p>
