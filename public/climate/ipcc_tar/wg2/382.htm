<h3>10.1.4. Climate Change Scenarios</h3>
<p>Carter et al. (2000) performed a comprehensive characterization of regional 
  climate change projections for the 21st century. They assumed a range of atmospheric 
  greenhouse gas (GHG) loadings according to the four draft marker scenarios developed 
  for the IPCC <i>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</i> (SRES), in combination 
  with the IPCC range of climate sensitivities (1.5-4.5&deg;C&#151;IPCC, 
  1996). Their method of analysis involved combining simple climate model estimates 
  of the global mean annual temperature response to four combinations of GHG forcing/climate 
  sensitivity (see <a href="152.htm#tab39">Table 3-9</a>) with regional patterns 
  of seasonal temperature and precipitation change obtained from 10 general circulation 
  model (GCM) simulations for the end of the 21st century relative to 1961-1990. 
  The GCM patterns of change were scaled up or down so that the global mean temperature 
  change from the GCM coincided with that obtained from the simple climate model. 
  Ten patterns of change were obtained for each emissions/climate sensitivity 
  combination, and each was averaged over subcontinental regions, including five 
  representing the African continent: southern Europe/north Africa, the Sahara, 
  west Africa, east Africa, and southern Africa (Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2000; see 
  <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Ranges of projected rates of change in temperature 
  and precipitation over these regions are depicted for each season, and projected 
  changes over southern Africa by the 2050s are compared with modeled natural 
  multi-tridecadal variability from the HadCM2 GCM 1,400-year control simulation 
  (Tett <i>et al., </i>1997) for the summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) months.</p>
<p>An analysis using the similar methodology also has been conducted specifically 
  for Africa (Hulme <i>et al.,</i> 2001). Future annual warming across Africa 
  ranges from 0.2&deg;C per decade (B1&#151;low scenario) to more than 0.5&deg;C 
  per decade (A2&#151;high scenario). This warming is greatest over the interior 
  of semi-arid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa. The intermodel 
  range (an indicator of the extent of agreement between different GCMs) is smallest 
  over north Africa and the equator and greatest over the interior of southern 
  Africa.</p>
<p>Future changes in mean seasonal rainfall in Africa are less well defined. Under 
  the lowest warming scenario, few areas experience changes in DJF or JJA that 
  exceed two standard deviations of natural variability by 2050. The exceptions 
  are parts of equatorial east Africa, where rainfall increases by 5-20% 
  in DJF and decreases by 5-10% in JJA.</p>
<p>Under the two intermediate warming scenarios, significant decreases (10-20%) 
  in rainfall during March to November, which includes the critical grain-filling 
  period, are apparent in north Africa in almost all models by 2050, as are 5-15% 
  decreases in growing-season (November to May) rainfall in southern Africa in 
  most models.</p>
<p>Under the most rapid global warming scenario, increasing areas of Africa experience 
  changes in summer or winter rainfall that exceed the one sigma level of natural 
  variability. Large areas of equatorial Africa experience increases in DJF rainfall 
  of 50-100% over parts of eastern Africa, with decreases in JJA over parts 
  of the Horn of Africa. However, there are some JJA rainfall increases for the 
  Sahel region.</p>
<p>Hulme <i>et al. </i>(2001) also analyzed future rainfall changes for three 
  African regions&#151;the Sahel, east Africa, and southeast Africa&#151;to illustrate 
  the extent of intermodel differences for these regions and to put future modeled 
  changes in the context of past observed changes (see <a href="383.htm#fig103">Figure 
  10-3</a>). Although model results vary, there is a general consensus for wetting 
  in East Africa, drying in southeast Africa, and a poorly specified outcome for 
  the Sahel.</p>
