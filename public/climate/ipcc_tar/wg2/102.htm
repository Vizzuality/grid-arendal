<h4>2.5.5.3. Ensuring Equity</h4>
<p>All of the complications outlined in <a href="101.htm">Section 2.5.5.2</a> 
  lead to a sad conclusion: Economics may be able to highlight a large menu of 
  distributional issues that must be examined, but it has trouble providing broad 
  answers to measuring and accounting for inequity, particularly across nations. 
  Recourse to ethical principles clearly is in order.</p>
<h3><a name="256"></a>2.5.6. Alternative Metrics for Measuring Costs</h3>
<p>Application and extension of the economic paradigm certainly focuses attention 
  on cost measures that are denominated in currency, but practitioners have been 
  criticized on the grounds that these measures inadequately recognize nonmarket 
  costs. Schneider et al. (2000), for example, have listed five numeraires or 
  metrics with which the costs of climate change might be captured. Their list 
  includes monetary losses, loss of life, changes in quality of life (including 
  a need to migrate, conflict over resources, cultural diversity, loss of cultural 
  heritage sites, etc.), species or biodiversity loss, and distributional equity. 
  <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a> recognizes the content of these diverse numeraires 
  in exploring magnitudes and/or rates of climate change that might be dangerous 
  according to three lines of evidence: threatened systems, distributions of impacts, 
  and aggregate impacts. The implications of the fourth line of evidence, large-scale 
  discontinuous events, are then traced along these three dimensions.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, however, costs denominated in one numeraire must 
  be weighed, at least subjectively, with costs denominated in another&#151;and 
  there are no objective quantitative methods with which to do so. A survey conducted 
  by Nordhaus (1994a), however, offered some insight into 15 researchers' 
  subjective views of the relative importance of several different measures along 
  three different "what if" scenarios. <a href="#tab21">Table 2-1</a> 
  displays some of the results in terms of anticipated cost denominated in lost 
  world GDP, the likelihood of high-consequence impacts, the distribution of costs 
  across the global population, and the proportion of costs that would be captured 
  by national income accounts. The survey results shows wide disagreement across 
  the first three metrics; this disagreement generally can be explained in terms 
  of a dichotomy of views between mainstream economists and natural scientists. 
  Nonetheless, Nordhaus (1994a) reports that a majority of respondents held the 
  view that a high proportion of costs would be captured in national accounts. 
  It would seem, therefore, that natural scientists think that mainstream economists 
  not only underestimate the severity of nonmarket impacts but also that the implications 
  of those impacts into the monetized economy do not follow.</p>
<p>Multi-attribute approaches also could be applied in climate impact analysis. 
  They have not yet found their way into the literature, however, except to the 
  degree to which they are captured in indirect methods outlined above. <a href="054.htm">Chapter 
  1</a> also notes that cultural theory can serve as a valuation framework.</p>
