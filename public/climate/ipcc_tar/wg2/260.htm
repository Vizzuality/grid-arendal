<p><a name="fig56"></a>To date, the only limnological properties measured or simulated 
  at a global scale are lake and river ice phenologies. Ice-cover durations for 
  inland waters have decreased over the entire northern hemisphere (Magnuson et 
  al., 2000) (see <a href="#fig56">Figure 5-6</a>). Change from 1846 to 1995 averaged 
  8.7 days later freeze and 9.8 days earlier break-up; these changes correspond 
  to a 1.8&deg;C increase in air temperature. Lake Suwa in Japan, Tornionoki River 
  in Finland, and Angara River in Siberia have longer records; ice phenologies 
  have been changing in the direction of warming since about the early 1700s, 
  but at slower rates than during 1846-1995. Interannual variability in freeze 
  dates, thaw dates, and ice duration are increasing (Kratz et al., 2001). Interannual 
  variability was greater from 1971 to 1990 than from 1951 to 1970 in 184 lakes 
  in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>For the Baltic Sea, which contains freshwater communities near shore and to 
  the north, simulation until 2050 reduced the extent of ice cover from 38% of 
  the area to 10%, and simulation until 2100 reduced ice cover to zero (Haapala 
  and Lepp&auml;ranta, 1997). For U.S. lakes, ice-on date, ice-off date, ice duration, 
  ice thickness, and the continuity of ice cover all responded to a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  change (Fang and Stefan, 1998). Mean duration at 209 locations distributed evenly 
  across the country declined by 45 days (60%), and ice thickness by 21 cm (62%). 
  Simulated profiles of deepwater oxygen concentrations and water temperatures 
  also changed dramatically in lakes across the United States (Fang and Stefan, 
  1997). </p>
<p>Lake ice influences biogeochemical cycling, including gas exchange with the 
  atmosphere, fish habitat availability (through changes in pH and dissolved oxygen), 
  biodiversity, and seasonal succession (Arnell et al., 1996; Cushing, 1997). 
  Decreased ice cover should reduce winterkill of fish.</p>
<p>Ice break-up date influences the productivity of diatoms beneath the ice of 
  Lake Baikal (Granin et al., 2001). Seasonal succession of phytoplankton in small 
  lakes is altered partly because of variation in the incoculum of algae beneath 
  the ice in different years (Adrian and Hintze, 2001). The mechanism for enhanced 
  diatom productivity in Lake Baikal is a combination of nutrient enrichment immediately 
  beneath the ice owing to the extrusion of salts as the water freezes and vertical 
  mixing that results from the greater density of the water with extruded salts 
  immediately beneath the ice. Reductions in ice thickness and increases in snow 
  would be expected to reduce diatom production.</p>
<p>River ice plays an important biological role by regulating flow aeration and 
  oxygen concentrations under the ice (Prowse, 1994; Chambers et al., 1997); dissolved 
  oxygen can approach critical levels for river biota (e.g., Power et al., 1993). 
  Decreases in the duration of the river-ice season or increases in the size and 
  frequency of open-water sections where re-aeration can occur will reduce anoxia. 
  Warmer winters favor the formation of mid-winter break-ups produced by rapid 
  snowmelt runoff, particularly those initiated by rain-on-snow events. Such events 
  significantly impact benthic invertebrate and fish populations where late-season 
  break-ups are the norm (Cunjak et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Ecological impacts will be influenced most by changes in break-up timing and 
  intensity. Physical disturbances from break-up scouring and flooding influence 
  nutrient and organic matter dynamics, spring water chemistry, and the abundance 
  and diversity of river biota (Scrimgeour et al., 1994; Cunjak et al., 1998). 
  Ice-induced flooding supplies the flux of sediment, nutrients, and water that 
  are essential to the health of freshwater delta ecosystems (e.g., Lesack et 
  al., 1991; Prowse and Conly, 1998). Even the mesoscale climate of delta ecosystems 
  depends on the timing and severity of break-up flooding (Prowse and Gridley, 
  1993). </p>
<p>Climate-induced change in ice cover or the timing and severity of its break-up 
  will affect the movement and deposition of sediment and associated contaminants. 
  Stable cover leads to deposition of sediment particles that would remain in 
  suspension without ice cover. Environmental contaminants with an affinity for 
  adsorption to fine-grained sediments are more likely to be deposited during 
  ice-covered, low-flow season than during open-water season. The break-up plume 
  contains the winter-long accumulation of contaminated sediment (Milburn and 
  Prowse, 1996). Sediment deposition zones often are where biological productivity 
  is greatest, such as on river deltas (Milburn and Prowse, 1998). Because growth 
  rates of aquatic organisms in cold regions are low and because higher trophic 
  level animals are longer lived, potential exists for greater lifelong accumulation 
  of contaminants in these aquatic ecosystems than in more temperate regions.</p>
<p>River ice is a key agent of geomorphologic change; it is responsible for creating 
  numerous erosional and depositional features within river channels and on channel 
  floodplains (e.g., Prowse and Gridley, 1993; Prowse, 1994). During break-up, 
  these processes cause channel enlargement and removal and succession of riparian 
  vegetation. Climatic conditions that alter the severity of such events will 
  greatly influence river morphology and riparian vegetation.</p>
