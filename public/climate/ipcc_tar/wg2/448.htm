<h4>11.2.5.2. Vector-Borne Diseases </h4>
<p>Health impacts secondary to the impacts of climate change on ecological and 
  social systems should include changes in the occurrence of vector-borne infectious 
  diseases in temperate and tropical Asia (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). 
  The distribution of diseases such as malaria is influenced by the spread of 
  vectors and the climate dependence of infectious pathogens (Hales et al., 1996; 
  McMichael et al., 1996; Epstein et al., 1998). In recent years, the resistance 
  of anopheline mosquito to pesticides and of malaria parasites to chloroquine 
  has affected eradication activities (Trigg and Kondrachina, 1998). Malaria still 
  is one of the most important diseases in countries in tropical Asia such as 
  India (Bouma et al., 1994; Akhtar and McMichael, 1996; Mukhopadhyay et al., 
  1997), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka (Bouma and Van der Kaay, 1996; Gunawardena et al., 
  1998), Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia (Rahman et al., 1997), Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam 
  (Hien et al., 1997), Indonesia (Fryauff et al., 1997), Papua New Guinea (Genton 
  et al., 1998), and Yunnan, China (Jiao et al., 1997; Xu and Liu, 1997) as a 
  result of the presence of the mosquito vectors and the lack of effective control.</p>
<p>With a rise in surface temperature and changes in rainfall patterns, the distribution 
  of vectors such as mosquito species may change (Patz and Martens, 1996; Reiter, 
  1998). Changes in environmental temperature and precipitation could expand vector-borne 
  diseases into temperate and arid Asia. The spread of vector-borne diseases into 
  more northern latitudes may pose a serious threat to human health. Climate change 
  is likely to have principal impacts on epidemics of malaria, dengue, and other 
  vector-borne diseases in Asia (Martens et al., 1999). The epidemic areas of 
  vector-borne diseases in Asia would depend on many demographic and societal 
  factors, as well as environmental hygiene for vector control, available health 
  infrastructure, and medical facilities (see also <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="11253"></a>11.2.5.3. Diseases Resulting from Higher UV-B Exposures</h4>
<p>Depletion of stratospheric ozone that normally filters out ultraviolet radiation 
  in sunlight in the region from 280 to 320 nm (the UV-B region) has been linked 
  to widespread use of volatile halogenated organic compounds, particularly chlorinated 
  and brominated methanes and chlorofluorocarbons. Some of these compounds also 
  are effective GHGs and therefore contribute to global warming as well. The quantitative 
  relationship between UV-B dose and its physiological effect varies with the 
  wavelength of UV-B exposure (Ilyas et al., 1999). These effects include melanoma 
  and non-melanoma skin cancers, cataracts and other ocular diseases, and dysfunction 
  of the systemic and cutaneous immune systems (Kripke, 1994). The known effects 
  of UV-B on the eye include inflammatory reactions from acute exposure, snow 
  blindness (photo-kerato-conjunctivitis), and long-term damage to the cornea 
  and lens (cataracts) from chronic exposure. It has been demonstrated that damage 
  to melanocytes in human skin initiates the progression of changes leading to 
  melanoma skin cancer (Kripke, 1994). Suppression of the immune response by UV-B 
  radiation involves damage to Langerhans cells and subsequent activation of T-lymphocytes, 
  thus increasing the severity of certain infectious diseases. </p>
<p>The impacts of greater exposure to shorter wavelength UV radiation on human 
  health are cumulative and, for some effects, may have long latencies. Noticeable 
  increases in UV-B radiation over high and mid-latitudes as a result of depletion 
  of stratospheric ozone have occurred in recent decades (Mckenzie et al., 1999; 
  WMO, 1999; ACIA, 2000). Climate change could make conditions for the spread 
  of diseases associated with higher UV-B doses more favorable.</p>
