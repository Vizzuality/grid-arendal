<p><a name="fig162"></a>Instrumental observations of climatic parameters over 
  the 20th century are available from standard climate stations on land and measurements 
  taken on drifting ice floes in the Arctic Ocean. The land stations show that 
  warming in the Arctic, as indicated by daily maximum and minimum temperatures, 
  has been as great as in any other part of the world. Although not geographically 
  uniform, the magnitude of the warming is about 5&deg;C per century, with areas 
  of cooling in eastern Canada, the north Atlantic, and Greenland (Koerner and 
  Lundgaard, 1996; Borzenkova, 1999a,b; Jones <i>et al</i>., 1999; Serreze <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
  Data from ice floe measurements show a slight warming on an annual basis, with 
  statistically significant warming in May and June over the 1961-1990 period. 
  Air temperature anomalies in the Arctic basin have been strongly positive since 
  1993. In the period 1987-1997, air temperature in the Arctic increased 
  by 0.9&deg;C (Alexandrov and Maistrova, 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Significant warming from the beginning of the 20th century has been confirmed 
  by many different proxy measurements (Maslanik <i>et al</i>., 1996; Bjorgo <i>et al</i>., 
  1997; Smith, 1998). Magnuson <i>et al</i>. (2000) found consistent evidence of later 
  freeze-up (5.8 days per 100 years) and earlier breakup (6.5 days per 100 years) 
  of ice on lakes and rivers around the northern hemisphere from 1846 to 1995 
  and an increase since 1950 in interannual variability of both dates. Glaciers 
  and ice caps in the Arctic also have shown retreat in low-lying areas since 
  about 1920. Numerous small, low-altitude glaciers and perennial snow patches 
  have disappeared. However, no increasing melting trend has been observed during 
  the past 40 years (Jania and Hagen, 1996; Koerner and Lundegaard, 1996; Dowdeswell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). Glaciers in Alaska have receded, with typical ice-thickness decreases 
  of 10 m over the past 40 years, but some glaciers have thickened in their upper 
  regions (BESIS, 1997). Greenland's ice sheet has thinned dramatically around 
  its southern and eastern margins. Above 2,000-m elevation, the ice sheet is 
  in balance, on average. The net effect is a loss of about 51 km<sup>3</sup> 
  yr<sup>-1</sup>. (Krabill <i>et al</i>., 1999, 2000).</p>
<p>Snow-cover extent in the northern hemisphere has been reduced since 1972 by 
  about 10%, largely as a result of spring and summer deficits since the mid-1980s 
  (Brown, 2000; Serreze <i>et al</i>., 2000). Most Arctic regions have experienced increases 
  in precipitation since at least the 1950s (Groisman <i>et al</i>., 1991; Groisman and 
  Easterling, 1994; Georgiyevskii, 1998). Measurements from Spitsbergen show a 
  statistically significant increase in precipitation during all seasons, except 
  winter (Hanssen-Bauer and Forland, 1998).</p>
<p>Groisman <i>et al</i>. (1994) analyzed seasonal snow extent in the northern hemisphere 
  and demonstrated an inverse relationship with near-surface air temperature. 
  Recent findings have provided evidence of a significant decrease in spring snow 
  extent since 1915 over Eurasia (Brown, 1997) and southern Canada (Brown and 
  Goodison, 1996). Such trends may be related to low-frequency fluctuations in 
  hemispheric atmospheric circulation patterns (Serreze <i>et al</i>., 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Arctic sea-ice extent decreased by approximately 3% per decade between 1978 
  and 1996 (Cavalieri <i>et al</i>., 1997; Parkinson <i>et al</i>., 1999; Johannessen 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999; Serreze <i>et al</i>., 2000). The most significant contractions 
  were detected in 1990, 1993, and 1995 (Maslanik <i>et al</i>., 1996). Ice composition 
  also has changed, with a reduction in the area of multi-year ice in winter. 
  Summer sea-ice extent has shrunk by 20% (880,000 km<sup>2</sup>) over the past 
  30 years in the Atlantic part of the Arctic Ocean (Johannessen <i>et al</i>., 
  1999), but the shrinkage has only been 5% in the Canadian Arctic Sea. Sea-ice 
  extent in the Bering Sea experienced a dramatic reduction when a regime shift 
  occurred in 1976 and has continued to decrease (BESIS, 1997). New compilations 
  of Arctic sea-ice extent, using historical data from the past 135 years (Vinje, 
  2001), show that overall sea-ice extent in April has been reduced in the Nordic 
  seas by 0.79 x 106 km<sup>2</sup> (33%) (see <a href="#fig163">Figure 16-3</a>). 
  Nearly half of this reduction took place between 1860 and 1900. Although there 
  are large interannual and seasonal variations in sea-ice extent, the reduction 
  is greatest in spring. This is consistent with the 1912-1996 temperature record 
  from Svalbard, which shows significant warming (3&deg;C) in spring (Hanssen-Bauer 
  and Forland, 1998). There is an approximate 10-year climate signal in the Arctic 
  and subarctic, with a clockwise propagating signal in sea-ice concentration 
  anomalies and a standing oscillation in sea-level pressure anomalies&#151;the 
  latter linked to the two phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Mysak 
  and Venegas, 1998). Comparison of these trends with outputs from climate models 
  (forced by observed GHGs and tropospheric sulfate aerosols) reveals that the 
  observed decrease in northern hemisphere sea-ice extent agrees with transient 
  simulations (see <a href="604.htm#fig166">Figure 16-6</a>) and that both trends 
  are much larger than would be expected from natural climate variations (Vinnikov 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
  <br>
  The most effective method for determining the thickness of sea ice is to use 
  sonar, directed upward at the floating ice from submarines or moorings (Melling 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995). The results indicate great variability. Average thinning of sea 
  ice has been observed since 1976 on some transects of the Atlantic and Arctic 
  Oceans (Wadhams, 1997). A thinning by about 0.13 m over the period 1970-1992,with 
  the maximum decrease detected in the eastern Siberian Sea, was found by Russian 
  scientists (Nagurduy, 1995). Rothrock <i>et al</i>. (1999) found that ice draft at 
  the end of the melt season has decreased by about 1.3 m in most of the deepwater 
  portion of the Arctic Ocean, from 3.1 m in 1958-1976 to 1.8 m in the 1990s 
  (~15% per decade). The decrease is greater in the central and eastern Arctic 
  than in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas (Rothrock <i>et al</i>., 1999). Vinje <i>et al</i>. 
  (1998), however, claim that no significant change in ice thickness can be observed 
  in Fram Strait. Their conclusion is in agreement with submarine observations 
  from 1960-1982. Although there is large variability, ice cover has continued 
  to become thinner and has decreased by 40% over the past 3 decades (Rothrock 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Analysis of the duration of summer melt over a large fraction 
  of the perennial Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 1996 reveals an increase of 5.3 
  days (8%) per decade in the number of melt days each summer (Smith, 1998). <br>
