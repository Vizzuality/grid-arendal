<h2>3.9. State of the Science and Future Needs for Scenario Development</h2>
<p>This chapter outlines the current practice of scenario development for climate 
  impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessment. Methods of scenario construction 
  and application are evolving rapidly, so it is useful to identify which aspects 
  are well developed and which aspects still are deficient.</p>
<h3><a name="391"></a>3.9.1. Well-Developed Features</h3>
<p>Some features of scenario development and application are well established 
  and tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensive monitoring efforts and continued development of global and regional 
    databases has improved the quality and consistency of baseline observational 
    data required for some scenario exercises, even in some data-sparse regions.</li>
  <li>Many impact studies apply incremental scenarios to explore the sensitivity 
    of an exposure unit to a range of climate futures; studies seldom rely exclusively 
    on a single, model-based scenario.</li>
  <li>Estimates of long-term mean global changes are available and widely applied 
    for a limited number of variables (e.g., population, economic development, 
    CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, global mean temperature), based on projections 
    produced by specialized international organizations or the use of simple models. 
  </li>
  <li>A growing volume of information now is available to enable scientists to 
    construct regional scenarios of many features of global change, even though 
    uncertainties in most projections remain high. A notable example is the IPCC-DDC, 
    which was established in 1998 to facilitate the timely distribution of a consistent 
    set of up-to-date projections of changes in climate and related environmental 
    and socioeconomic factors for use in climate impact and adaptation assessment. 
    Some of the studies reported in this volume use scenarios derived from information 
    held in the DDC (see, e.g., <a href="143.htm#tab35">Table 3-5</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="392"></a>3.9.2. Deficiencies in Knowledge and Future Needs</h3>
<p>There are many shortcomings of current scenario development, but there also 
  are promising new methods that may address these problems and require further 
  attention. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Future socioeconomic, environmental, and land-use changes have not been 
    represented satisfactorily in many recent impact studies and need to be integrated 
    into the process of scenario development. </li>
  <li>Many impact studies fail to consider adequately uncertainties embedded in 
    the scenarios they adopt. New techniques are emerging to explore the role 
    of scenarios, conditional probabilities, and conditional forecasts in providing 
    policy-relevant advice in impact assessments in an environment of high uncertainty.</li>
  <li>There is a mismatch between the time and space scales at which scenario 
    information commonly is provided and the resolution at which it is required 
    for impact assessments. Methods of obtaining higher resolution scenarios of 
    global change from broad-scale projections are being actively developed and 
    refined. However, in some regions of the world the coverage and availability 
    of baseline global change data are still poor, which has hampered efforts 
    at scenario development.</li>
  <li>Most global change scenarios consider long-term and broad-scale changes 
    in mean conditions. Scenarios of changes in variability and the frequency 
    of extreme events (climatic or nonclimatic) seldom are constructed because 
    it is difficult to simulate such events and because they are complicated to 
    formulate and explain. More research is required into methods of representing 
    variability change in scenarios.</li>
  <li>Scenarios for impact studies lag new developments in climate modeling. There 
    is a need to reduce this time lag to deliver up-to-date scenarios for impact 
    assessment (e.g., constructing regional climate and sea-level scenarios by 
    using outputs from AOGCM simulations that are based on SRES emissions scenarios).</li>
  <li>Few comprehensive scenarios have been developed to date for examining the 
    consequences of stabilizing GHG concentrations at different concentrations, 
    in line with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
    Change (UNFCCC).</li>
  <li>Climate change mitigation conventionally has been treated separately from 
    impacts and adaptation, except in some studies that use IAMs. However, these 
    two methods of responding to climate change are inextricably linked, and this 
    linkage should be reflected in scenarios. Efforts to develop the SRES scenarios 
    with well-elaborated narratives and improved appreciation of important interactions 
    in the climate system seem likely to generate greater consistency among scenarios. 
  </li>
  <li>Few scenarios directly address adaptation, but existing scenario methods 
    could be refined to do so (e.g., by combining scenarios of climate change 
    with decision support and similar systems being used to foster adaptation 
    under current climate variability).</li>
  <li>Improved guidance material and training is required in the construction 
    of integrated global change scenarios (see, e.g., IPCC-TGCIA, 1999; Hulme 
    <i>et al</i>., 2000), especially concerning the development of nonclimatic 
    scenarios.<br>
  </li>
