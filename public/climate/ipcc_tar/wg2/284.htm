<h2><a name="21"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
Global climate change will affect the physical, biological, and biogeochemical 
characteristics of the oceans and coasts, modifying their ecological structure, 
their functions, and the goods and services they provide. Large-scale impacts 
of global warming on the oceans will include:
<ul>
  <li>Increases in sea level and sea-surface temperature</li>
  <li>Decreases in sea-ice cover</li>
  <li>Changes in salinity, alkalinity, wave climate, and ocean circulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedbacks to the climate system will occur through changes in ocean mixing, 
  deep water production, and coastal upwelling. Collectively, these changes will 
  have profound impacts on the status, sustainability, productivity, and biodiversity 
  of the coastal zone and marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scientists recently have recognized the persistence of multi-year climate-ocean 
  regimes and shifts from one regime to another. Changes in recruitment patterns 
  of fish populations and the spatial distribution of fish stocks have been linked 
  to climate-ocean system variations such as the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation 
  (ENSO) and decadal-scale oscillations. Fluctuations in fish abundance increasingly 
  are regarded as a biological response to medium-term climate-ocean variations, 
  and not just as a result of overfishing and other anthropogenic factors. Of 
  course, such factors can exacerbate natural fluctuations and damage fish stocks. 
  Global warming will confound the impact of natural variation and fishing activity 
  and make management more complex.</p>
<p>Growing recognition of the role of understanding the climate-ocean system in 
  the management of fish stocks also is leading to new adaptive strategies that 
  are based on the determination of stock resilience and acceptable removable 
  percentages of fish. We need to know more about these interactions. Climate-ocean-related 
  changes in the distribution of fish populations suggest that the sustainability 
  of the fishing industries of many countries will depend on increasing flexibility 
  in bilateral and multilateral fishing agreements, coupled with international 
  stock assessments and management plans.</p>
<p>Marine mammals and seabirds are large consumers of fish and have been shown 
  to be sensitive to inter-annual and longer term variability in oceanographic 
  and atmospheric parameters. Several marine mammal and bird species, including 
  polar bears and some seabirds, may be threatened by long-term climate change.</p>
<p>Marine aquaculture production has more than doubled since 1990 and is expected 
  to continue its upward trend. However, aquaculture may be limited if key fish 
  species used in feed production are negatively impacted by climate change. Increases 
  in seawater temperature may directly impact aquaculture; such increases already 
  have been associated with increases in diseases and algal blooms.</p>
<p>The adaptive capacities of marine and coastal ecosystems varies among species, 
  sectors, and geographical regions. In the broader oceans, marine organisms will 
  be relatively free to move to new geographical areas; organisms in enclosed 
  seas and coastal zones are more constrained by the physical features of the 
  shore, making natural adaptation more difficult.</p>
<p>Coastal zones are among the world's most diverse and productive environments. 
  With global warming and sea-level rise, many coastal systems will experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased levels of inundation and storm flooding</li>
  <li>Accelerated coastal erosion</li>
  <li>Seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater</li>
  <li>Encroachment of tidal waters into estuaries and river systems</li>
  <li>Elevated sea-surface and ground temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tropical and subtropical coastlines, particularly in areas that are already 
  under stress from human activities, are highly susceptible to global warming 
  impacts. Particularly at risk are the large delta regions&#151;especially in 
  Asia, where vulnerability was recognized more than a decade ago and continues 
  to increase. Mid-latitude temperate coasts often comprise coastal plains and 
  barriers and soft sedimentary cliffs and bluffs that have been the subject of 
  historical and model studies, virtually all of which confirm the high vulnerability 
  of these coasts. High-latitude coastlines also are susceptible, although the 
  impacts in these areas have been less studied. A combination of accelerated 
  sea-level rise, increased melting of ground ice, decreased sea-ice cover, and 
  associated more energetic wave conditions will have severe impacts on coastal 
  landforms, settlements, and infrastructure. </p>
<p>Coastal areas also include complex ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangrove 
  forests, and salt marshes. In such environments, the impact of accelerated sea-level 
  rise will depend on vertical accretion rates and space for horizontal migration, 
  which may be limited by the presence of infrastructure. Many mangrove forests 
  are under stress from excessive exploitation, and salt marshes are under stress 
  from reclamation. Many coral reefs already are degraded. In such situations, 
  ecosystem resilience will be greatly reduced through human impacts as well as 
  rising sea levels, increasing sea temperatures, and other climate-ocean-related 
  changes, including prevailing wave activity and storm waves and surges.</p>
<p>Progress in evaluating the potential effects of climate change and sea-level 
  rise on socioeconomic systems has not been as substantial as that relating to 
  biogeophysical impacts. With reference to coastal zones, socioeconomic impacts 
  have been considered in several ways, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a component of vulnerability assessment of natural systems</li>
  <li>With an emphasis on market-oriented or nonmarket-oriented approaches</li>
  <li>With a focus on costs for infrastructure and adaptation options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three coastal adaptation strategies have been identified previously: protect, 
  accommodate, and retreat. In the past few years, structural shore-protection 
  measures have been reevaluated, and there has been greater interest in managing 
  coastal retreat. Enhancement of biophysical and socioeconomic resilience in 
  coastal regions is increasingly regarded as a desirable adaptive strategy but 
  appears not to be feasible in many of the world's coastal zones. Additional 
  insights can be gained by understanding adaptation to natural variability.</p>
<p>Although some countries and coastal communities have the adaptive capacity 
  to minimize the impacts of climate change, others have fewer options; the consequences 
  may be severe for them. Geographic and economic variability leads to inequity 
  in the vulnerability of coastal communities and potentially in intergenerational 
  access to food, water, and other resources. Techniques for the integration of 
  biophysical and socioeconomic impact assessment and adaptation are developing 
  slowly, while human population growth in many coastal regions is increasing 
  socioeconomic vulnerability and decreasing the resilience of coastal ecosystems. 
</p>
<p>Integrated assessment and management of open marine and coastal ecosystems 
  and a better understanding of their interaction with human development will 
  be important components of successful adaptation to climate change. Also important 
  will be integration of traditional practices into assessments of vulnerability 
  and adaptation.</p>
