<h3>18.5.3. Adaptive Capacity of Regions</h3>
<p>At the global scale, there is considerable variation among countries with regard 
  to their capacity to adapt to climate change. Given their economic affluence 
  and stability; their institutions and infrastructures; and their access to capital, 
  information, and technology, developed nations are broadly considered to have 
  greater capacity to adapt than developing regions or countries in economic transition 
  (Goklany, 1995; Burton, 1996; Magalh&atilde;es, 1996; Toman and Bierbaum, 1996). 
  In general, countries with well-developed social institutions supported by higher 
  levels of capital and stores of human knowledge are considered to have greater 
  adaptive capacity (Smith and Lenhart, 1996). Adaptation options&#151;including 
  traditional coping strategies&#151;often are available in developing countries 
  and countries in transition; in practice, however, those countries' capacity 
  to effect timely response actions may be beyond their infrastructure and economic 
  means (IPCC, 1997). For those countries, the main barriers are (Smith, 1996; 
  IPCC, 1998; Mizina <i>et al.</i>, 1999):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial/market (uncertain pricing, availability of capital, lack of credit)</li>
  <li>Institutional/legal (weak institutional structure, institutional instability)</li>
  <li>Social/cultural (rigidity in land-use practices, social conflicts)</li>
  <li>Technological (existence, access)</li>
  <li>Informational/educational (lack of information, trained personnel).</li>
  </ul>
<p>A study by Rosenzweig and Parry (1994) found considerable disparity between 
    developed and developing countries in terms of potential adverse effects of 
    climate change on agricultural systems; developing countries suffer the greatest 
    losses. In addition, poorer, developing regions presumably will face stricter 
    constraints on technology and institutions (Fankhauser and Tol, 1997) and 
    that measures taken in response to climate change may be very demanding financially 
    (Dvorak <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Deschingkar, 1998). Researchers also believe that compared 
    to industrialized countries, developing countries possess a lower adaptive 
    capacity as a result of greater reliance on climatic resources (Schelling, 
    1992; Fankhauser and Tol, 1997).</p>
<p>There is some suggestion, however, that the complex, multi-species, low- to 
  middle-intensity farming systems that characterize agricultural endeavors in 
  the developing world may have greater adaptive capacity under conditions of 
  global climate change than western monocultures (Ramakrishnan, 1998). An example 
  is found in the village of Maatisar (India), where local institutions in the 
  past have operated on the principle of "moral economy," or guaranteed 
  subsistence to all households in the village. These institutions have eroded 
  over time, however, giving way to competitive market relations that do not guarantee 
  subsistence during times of drought. As a result, the capacity of individual 
  households to withstand seasonal fluctuations has decreased over time (Chen, 
  1991). Magalh&atilde;es (1996) describes how northeast Brazil has become more 
  vulnerable to droughts as inappropriate land use overstresses natural land and 
  water resources and as the capacity to cope is limited by poverty.</p>
<p>Acceptance of western economic ideals coupled with increasing and rapid development 
  may reduce the capacity of traditional societies to adapt (Watts, 1983; Chan 
  and Parker, 1996). In the case of traditional or indigenous societies, the pursuit 
  of western/ European-style development trajectories may modify the nature of 
  adaptive capacity (some improved, some diminished) by introducing greater technology 
  dependence and higher density settlement and by devaluing traditional ecological 
  knowledge and cultural values (Newton, 1995). For example, notwithstanding remarkable 
  adaptations to a harsh climate, the North American Inuit continue to be vulnerable 
  to climate change as a result of their dependence on wildlife (which are climate-sensitive). 
  This vulnerability has been reduced by technological enhancement of adaptive 
  capacity through the acquisition of snowmobiles, motorized boats, and even sonar. 
  Such technological advances have allowed Inuit communities to become far more 
  "fixed" than before. Many of the most densely populated areas lie 
  at least partially within a few meters of sea level. This lack of "semi-permanence" 
  may actually increase the Inuits' vulnerability to potential climate-induced 
  sea-level rise by decreasing their capacity to adapt through retreat or migration 
  (Rayner and Malone, 1998). </p>
<p>Although there is considerable literature on the determinants of adaptive capacity 
  and examples of how they influence the adaptability of particular communities, 
  there is little scholarship (and even less agreement) on criteria or variables 
  by which adaptive capacity can be measured and by which the adaptive capacity 
  of global regions can be quantitatively compared. Various studies have attempted 
  to identify overall trends that cause increased or decreased vulnerability to 
  environmental hazards (Torry, 1979; Lamb, 1982; Warrick and Reibsame, 1983; 
  Ausubel, 1991b; Blaikie <i>et al.</i>, 1994); unfortunately, however, the concept of 
  vulnerability "does not rest well on a developed theory, nor is it associated 
  with widely accepted indicators or methods of measurement" (Bohle <i>et al.</i>, 
  1994). </p>
<p>Even less progress has been made in measuring adaptive capacity. In the context 
  of African agriculture, Downing <i>et al.</i> (1997) attempt to quantitatively measure 
  relative adaptive capacity of regions by using crude surrogates such as gross 
  national product (GNP). Empirical local-level studies of vulnerability are so 
  complex, however, that attempts to describe patterns or estimate trends at global 
  or regional scales are extremely difficult (Liverman, 1990; Downing, 1991; Dow, 
  1992). These "difficulties in generalizing about levels of vulnerability 
  even in a relatively small community" are demonstrated by Adger and Kelly's 
  (1999) study of vulnerability to climate change in Vietnam. Because vulnerability 
  is a composite concept, social change has the potential to make individuals 
  or activities more vulnerable in some ways and less vulnerable in others (Rayner 
  and Malone, 1998). The influence of changes in the determinants of adaptive 
  capacity are not necessarily direct or clear, rendering the attempt to develop 
  systematic indices for measurement and comparison a difficult task.</p>
