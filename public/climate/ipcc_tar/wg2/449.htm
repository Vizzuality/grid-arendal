<h4>11.2.5.4. Other Diseases </h4>
<p>The distribution of water-borne infectious diseases is influenced mainly by 
  the hygienic circumstance of water (Epstein, 1992; Echeverria et al., 1995; 
  Colwell, 1996; Esrey, 1996). Water-borne diseases&#151;including cholera and 
  the suite of diarrheal diseases caused by organisms such as giardia, salmonella, 
  and cryptosporidium&#151;are common with contamination of drinking water quality 
  in many countries of south Asia (Echeverria et al., 1995; Colwell, 1996; Esrey, 
  1996). Higher SSTs and rich nutrient load in major river deltas would support 
  extended phytoplankton blooms in selected coastal areas of temperate and tropical 
  Asia. These phytoplankton blooms are habitats for the survival and spread of 
  infectious bacterial diseases. The cholera outbreak in Bangladesh during 1994 
  has been attributed to the presence of extended phytoplankton blooms (Colwell, 
  1996). The aforementioned water-borne diseases could become more common in many 
  countries of south Asia in a warmer climate.</p>
<p>For preventive actions, impact assessments are necessary on various aspects 
  such as the nutritional situation, drinking water supply, water salinity, and 
  ecosystem damage (Kaye and Novell, 1994; Graczyk and Fried, 1998). Water-borne 
  infectious diseases, natural disaster, environmental migration, nutritional 
  deficiency, and environmental pollution should be major risk factors for human 
  health (Thongkrajai et al., 1990; Pazzaglia et al., 1995, Colwell, 1996). The 
  risk factor of diseases also will depend on infrastructure, economic conditions, 
  the hygienic situation, and medical facilities. Risk could be reduced by awareness 
  in the communities that are more vulnerable to instability in the future environment. 
</p>
<p>In Asia, economic and population growth will expand rapidly during the 21st 
  century in many countries. The rapid increase in population will be accompanied 
  by migration from rural communities to overcrowded large cities (Stephens, 1995). 
  Disasters linked to climate extremes such as floods and droughts also would 
  impact local and regional populations and enforce migration. The huge energy 
  consumption by the expanding population in urban cities would result in degradation 
  of air and water quality, whereas rapid expansion of the economy will bring 
  about improvements in living standards, such as improved environmental sanitation, 
  hygienic practice, and medical treatment facilities. Therefore, better understanding 
  of the interaction among climate change and environmental and health status 
  in communities at regional and local scales is crucial to forge physiological 
  acclimatization and social adaptations in the future.</p>
