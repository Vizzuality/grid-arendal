<h3>1.4.2. Detection and Attribution of Impacts to Climate Change </h3>
<p>Many observed changes in ecosystems, animal (e.g., butterfly and bird patterns) 
  and plant (e.g., timing of flowering) species, and physical systems (e.g., glaciers 
  or river runoff) have been associated with observed changes in climate (not 
  necessarily anthropogenic changes) in recent decades (high confidence). Moreover, 
  as described in <a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>, 
  such observed changes often are in the directions expected as a response to 
  climate stimuli, based on understandings expressed in the literature about biophysical 
  processes that govern responses to climate (e.g., Root and Schneider, 2001; 
  Root et al., 2001). This consistency has led the authors of such studies to 
  conclude that surface temperature trends of recent decades are likely to be 
  discernible at regional scales through observed changes in biological and physical 
  entities for several systems (varying confidence, depending on which specific 
  system is considered; see, e.g., <a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>). 
  From these observed responses to the relatively small climate changes observed 
  to date (as compared to changes projected for the next century), it is concluded 
  that many environmental systems can be highly sensitive to climate change. However, 
  determination of a potential causal relationship between the response of a physical 
  or biological system to observed recent climatic changes does not imply that 
  regional climate changes were a direct result of anthropogenic global climatic 
  trends, although the latter are likely to have had significant influence on 
  many regional trends. Working Group II does not focus on evaluating the likelihood 
  that regional observed climatic variations are caused by anthropogenic climate 
  changes; detection and attribution assessment of climatic changes is primarily 
  a Working Group I activity. As noted, however, Working Group II does address 
  attribution of observed changes to environmental systems to observed climate 
  changes, even if the connection to possible anthropogenic climate changes is 
  not specifically addressed here. </p>
<h3><a name="143"></a>1.4.3. Key Determinants of Impacts</h3>
<h4> <a name="1431"></a>1.4.3.1. Magnitude of Change </h4>
<p>Early studies concentrated on impacts caused by changes in global mean temperature. 
  Often these studies were carried out at a few elevated temperatures-typically, 
  2°C and 4°C (corresponding to the bulk of the range of IPCC Working Group I 
  SAR equilibrium temperature rise expected for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  above pre-industrial levels). Global mean temperature still is a significant 
  variable, serving as a modulus of change against which to compare climate sensitivities 
  and impacts. In addition to mean quantities, however, other characteristics 
  of climate measures, such as climate variability or runs of unusually warm weather, 
  have become important variables for analysis (e.g., Mearns et al., 1984; Colombo 
  et al., 1999), as has specification of changes in regional temperatures, sea 
  level, and precipitation. These expanded measures of climatic change are routinely 
  included in recent impact studies (e.g., IPCC, 1998). Less often considered 
  are changes in extreme events (but see <a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table SPM-1</a>, 
  <a href="005.htm">WGII TAR Summary for Policymakers</a>), 
  despite their potential importance. </p>
<h4><a name="1432"></a>1.4.3.2. Rate of Change </h4>
<p>It is essentially undisputed that a sustained 2°C temperature change occurring 
  in a decade would have a more profound impact than one occurring over a century. 
  The effect of rates of change on impacts is still under active investigation 
  (see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>). Early results have suggested that rates 
  of change exceeding the ability of ecosystems to migrate would be particularly 
  damaging (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Adaptation of coastal dwellers 
  to rapid climatic changes or a high background "noise level" of natural variability 
  would be more difficult relative to slowly occurring changes or smoothly varying 
  climates (e.g., West et al., 2001). Finally, as noted by IPCC Working Group 
  I (1996a, p. 7), "nonlinear systems, when rapidly forced, are particularly subject 
  to unexpected behavior." In other words, the adaptability of various decision 
  agents would be reduced if any change is unexpected; thus, a rapid rate of change 
  is more likely to generate "surprises" that inhibit effective adaptation by 
  natural and managed systems. <a href="061.htm#tab11">Table 1-1</a> describes 
  several extreme events that can substantially influence the vulnerability of 
  sectors or regions to climatic changes (see also <a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table 
  SPM-1</a>, <a href="005.htm">WGII TAR Summary for Policymakers</a>). 
</p>
<p>Economists also have suggested that the transient stage of moving from one 
  equilibrium climate to another could cause the greatest economic impacts, even 
  if the static impacts of the new equilibrium climate were small (Nordhaus and 
  Boyer, 2000). </p>
<h4><a name="1433"></a>1.4.3.3. Transient Scenarios </h4>
<p>Climate sensitivity-the globally averaged response of the surface temperature 
  to a fixed doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>-is based on static or equilibrium calculations 
  in which the climatic model is allowed to reach a steady state after the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase is applied. The real Earth, on the other hand, is being forced by a 
  time-evolving forcing of GHGs and other global change forcings; this, combined 
  with the time-evolving response of the climate system to any forcing, means 
  that the amount of global climatic warming, as well as the time-evolving patterns 
  of climatic changes, are likely to be different during the transient phase of 
  climatic change than in equilibrium. Recent studies of climate change impacts 
  have made use of transient or time-dependent scenarios of climate change that 
  are derived from fully coupled, ocean-atmosphere general circulation models 
  (AOGCMs). These studies indicate that many systems would be notably affected 
  (see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>)-some adversely and some beneficially-by 
  changes in climate within the next 2 to 3 decades (high confidence). Farther 
  into the 21st century, as radiative forcing on the climate builds, the magnitude 
  of adverse impacts would increase, the number and scale of many beneficial effects 
  would decrease (<a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>), and the probability that 
  adverse impacts would predominate would increase (high confidence). Transient 
  scenarios are just entering the climate impacts literature, which unfortunately 
  tends to lag the climate effects literature by several years; thus, much of 
  the impacts literature still is based on equilibrium climate change scenarios. 
  To the extent possible, Working Group II has assessed literature that uses transient 
  scenarios. It is important to use transient scenarios as much as possible because 
  the climate effects literature suggests that static calculations (typically, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> held fixed at double pre-industrial concentrations) do not produce 
  the same time-evolving regional patterns of climatic changes as do transients-and 
  because, of course, the actual Earth is undergoing a transient response to anthropogenic 
  forcings.</p>

<h4><a name="1434"></a>1.4.3.4. Climate Variability and Extreme Events </h4>
<p>Most studies of climate change impacts have focused on changes in mean climate 
  conditions. However, global climate change is likely to bring changes in climate 
  variability and extreme events as well. This is relevant here because decisionmakers 
  often consider hedging strategies to be prepared for the possibility of low-probability 
  but high-consequence events-a risk management framework. Features of projected 
  changes in extreme weather and climate events in the 21st century include more 
  frequent heat waves, less frequent cold spells (barring so-called singular events), 
  greater intensity of heavy rainfall events, more frequent midcontinental summer 
  drought, greater intensity of tropical cyclones, and more intense El Niño-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) events (<a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table SPM-1</a>, <a href="005.htm">WGII 
  TAR Summary for Policymakers</a>). </p>
<p>A small number of studies have investigated the potential impacts of hypothesized 
  changes in climate variability and/or extreme events. Results of these studies, 
  coupled with observations of impacts from historical events (e.g., <a href="321.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>), suggest that changes in climate variability and extremes are likely 
  to be at least as important as changes in mean climate conditions in determining 
  climate change impacts and vulnerability (high confidence). The literature suggests 
  that omission of changes in extreme events and/or climate variability will yield 
  underestimates of climate change impacts and vulnerability. In its assessment 
  of potential vulnerabilities and adaptation options, Working Group II has focused 
  on the interactions of natural climate variability and anthropogenic change 
  and the potential for "win-win" adaptation options that would increase resilience 
  to both phenomena. </p>
<h4><a name="1435"></a>1.4.3.5. Thresholds </h4>
<p>In many environmental fields, there are thought to be thresholds below which 
  only minor effects occur. Critical levels in acid rain are one example (Brodin 
  and Kuylenstierna, 1992). These kinds of thresholds also are possible in climate 
  change and are incorporated into some models as "tolerable" levels that must 
  be exceeded before significant impacts occur (Hope et al., 1993). </p>
<p>However, in climate change, thresholds have been proposed that are much more 
  complicated. Below the threshold, there may be some impacts, but they will be 
  smoothly varying with the change in climate. Some positive effects might even 
  be observed in some regions or sectors for a small global warming, giving the 
  impression that there is little impact. Above the threshold, however, potentially 
  damaging events may occur. For example, most models show (by 2100) a weakening 
  of thermohaline circulation that transports warmer water to the North Atlantic 
  (see <a href="../wg1/005.htm">TAR WGI Summary for Policymakers</a>) 
  but only very low confidence that there will be full collapse of the thermohaline 
  circulation by 2100-although some rapid greenhouse buildup scenarios suggest 
  that emissions during the 21st century could trigger a collapse in the following 
  century (e.g., Rahmstorf, 1999; Schneider and Thompson, 2000). Likewise, only 
  very low confidence is given to the prospect of substantial collapse by 2100 
  of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (<a href="../wg1/005.htm">TAR WGI Summary 
  for Policymakers</a>). Other examples of potential threshold phenomena can be 
  found in the literature for regional situations. For example, Wang and Eltahir 
  (2000) demonstrate that rainfall in the Sahel region of Africa can have several 
  equilibrium values, depending on the level of disturbance to vegetation cover. 
  For vegetation removal of less than a threshold value, the system recovers within 
  a few years. For vegetation removal above a threshold, however, there is a new 
  steady-state rainfall regime that is much reduced from "normal" conditions. 
  These thresholds may be, as characterized previously, a result of rapid transient 
  forcing of the climate system, in terms of altered radiative properties of the 
  atmosphere or characteristics of the land surface. Although such threshold events 
  remain somewhat speculative, their impacts clearly would be more severe than 
  smoothly varying (and thus more adaptable) events. Some thresholds in impacts, 
  however, are much less speculative, such as hospital admissions for heat conditions 
  above a threshold temperature-and these threshold temperatures vary regionally 
  as there is some acclimatization to heat stress (<a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>)-or 
  species living near mountaintops that would be forced out of existence, even 
  by smooth climatic warming, because they reached the threshold of having no 
  place to move up into (e.g., Still et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Sometimes the expression "threshold" is used as an approximation when the response 
  actually is more likely to be smooth but strongly nonlinear. The release of 
  methane from gas hydrates trapped in deep sediments and the health impacts of 
  thermal stress would be examples of this category. Working Group II assesses 
  potential thresholds for ecological and human systems. </p>
<h4><a name="1436"></a>1.4.3.6. Surprises </h4>
<p>By definition, it is difficult to give examples of the surprises that might 
  be created under a changed climate. Such surprises, however, can make even the 
  most careful calculation of impacts extremely inaccurate, as noted previously. 
  Surprises have been classified by many authors in many contexts (see Schneider 
  et al., 1998, for a review of the literature and many citations). In particular, 
  low-probability events-or those whose probability is difficult to assess-often 
  are labeled rhetorically as "surprises," even though the event has been classified 
  or identified as known. Strictly speaking, such events are more accurately called 
  "imaginable surprises;" true surprises are wholly unexpected events. Another 
  useful category is "imaginable conditions for surprise" (Schneider et al., 1998), 
  where the specific event in question is unexpected but a set of conditions that 
  increases the likelihood of surprises can be assessed; increasing the rate of 
  forcing of the climatic system is one example, as noted in <a href="#1432">Section 
  1.4.3.2</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="1437"></a>1.4.3.7. Nonlinear, Complex, and Discontinuous Responses 
</h4>
<p>Investigations into climate change and its potential consequences have begun 
  to highlight the importance of strongly nonlinear, complex, and discontinuous 
  responses. These types of responses, called singularities, can occur at all 
  temporal and spatial scales of systems influenced by climate change (high confidence 
  can be given to the likelihood that some such singularities will occur, but 
  low confidence usually is assigned to any specific example of a possible abrupt 
  event; see <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>). Strongly nonlinear responses are 
  characterized by thresholds-which, if exceeded by a stimulus, result in substantially 
  greater sensitivity to further stimulus or dramatic change, explosive growth, 
  or collapse. Complex responses involve interactions of many intricate elements 
  that yield outcomes that are not easily predicted. Examples of these types of 
  responses include coral bleaching, collapse of fish stocks, disease outbreaks, 
  changes in fire and other disturbance regimes in vegetation systems, crop failure, 
  malnutrition and hunger, and collapse of pastoral communities. Advances in our 
  understanding of these types of responses are largely qualitative, but they 
  are important in understanding the character of dangers posed by climate change. 
  Omission of potential nonlinear and complex responses from climate change impact 
  assessments is expected (well-established, but incomplete) to yield underestimates 
  of impacts (see <a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>). 
  Because of the magnitude of their potential consequences, large-scale discontinuous 
  responses warrant careful consideration in evaluations of climate change dangers. 
  Working Group II points to the potential for such occurrences and their potential 
  consequences for human and natural systems, but it is unable to provide detailed 
  assessments of potential effects, given the paucity of information in the literature.
