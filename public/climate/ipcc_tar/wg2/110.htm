<h4>2.6.5.3. Overconfidence </h4>
<p>Overconfidence is another cognitive illusion that has been reported to plague 
  experts' judgments. In the 1970s and 1980s, a considerable amount of evidence 
  was amassed for the view that people suffer from an overconfidence bias. The 
  common finding is that respondents are correct less often than their confidence 
  assessments imply. </p>
<p>However, "ecological" theorists (cf. McClelland and Bolger, 1994) 
  claim that overconfidence is an artifact of artificial experimental tasks and 
  nonrepresentative sampling of stimulus materials. Gigerenzer <i>et al</i>. (1991) 
  and Juslin (1994) claim that individuals are well adapted to their environments 
  and do not make biased judgments. Overconfidence is observed because the typical 
  general knowledge quiz used in most experiments contains a disproportionate 
  number of misleading items. These authors have found that when knowledge items 
  are randomly sampled, the overconfidence phenomenon disappears. Juslin <i>et 
  al</i>. (2000) report a meta-analysis comparing 35 studies in which items were 
  randomly selected from a defined domain with 95 studies in which items were 
  selected by experimenters. Although overconfidence was evident for selected 
  items, it was close to zero for randomly sampled items&#151;which suggests that 
  overconfidence is not simply a ubiquitous cognitive bias. This analysis suggests 
  that the appearance of overconfidence may be an illusion created by research, 
  not a cognitive failure by respondents. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in cases of judgments of repeated events (weather forecasters, 
  horse race bookmakers, tournament bridge players), experts make well-calibrated 
  forecasts. In these cases, respondents might be identifying relative frequencies 
  for sets of similar events rather than judging the likelihood of individual 
  events. If we compare studies of the calibration of probability assessments 
  concerning individual events (e.g., Wright and Ayton, 1992) with those in which 
  subjective assessments have been made for repetitive predictions of events (Murphy 
  and Winkler, 1984), we observe that relatively poor calibration has been observed 
  in the former, whereas relatively good calibration has been observed in the 
  latter.</p>
<p>It might be concluded that a frequentist rather than a Bayesian approach should 
  be adopted when attempting to elicit judgment. However, there are occasions 
  when there will be events for which no obvious reference class exists and one 
  will be unable to assess likelihood by adopting the frequentist approach. This 
  particularly applies to novel situations for which there is no actuarial history. 
  One might well be able to account for the (no doubt varying) subjective probabilities 
  offered by a sample of people by identifying mental heuristics. However, note 
  that, without a reference class, we have no means of evaluating the validity 
  of any judgments that might be offered. Consequently, any probability given 
  to a unique event remains somewhat ambiguous.</p>
