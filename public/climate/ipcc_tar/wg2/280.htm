<h3>5.9.3. Adaptation Options </h3>
<p>Opportunities for adapting to expected changes in high-latitude ecosystems 
  are limited because these systems will respond most strongly to globally induced 
  changes in climate rather than to regionally controlled and regulated factors. 
  The effects of climate and disturbance regime on regional productivity and carbon 
  balance may be difficult to alter at the local or regional scale. The most important 
  opportunities for mitigation will be protection of peatlands, yedoma sediments, 
  and other carbon-rich areas from large-scale hydrological change. It is unlikely 
  that expected changes in fire or thermokarst regime can be altered except in 
  areas of high population densities. Adaptation options for forests that occur 
  in these areas are presented in <a href="242.htm">Section 5.6</a>.</p>
<p>The most important opportunities for adaptation in arctic ecosystems may exist 
  for culturally important resources such as reindeer, caribou, waterfowl, and 
  specific plant taxa (see <a href="218.htm">Section 5.4</a>). Careful management 
  of these resources could minimize climatic impacts on indigenous peoples. Another 
  adaptation option is diversification. Many high-latitude regions depend strongly 
  on one or a few resources&#151;such as timber, oil, reindeer, or wages from 
  fighting fires. Economic diversification would reduce the impacts of large changes 
  in the availability or economic value of particular goods and services.</p>
<p>In alpine regions, major opportunities for adaptation relate to protection 
  from large-scale changes in land use or pollutant levels. Because these causes 
  of change are local to regional, wise management could minimize changes. </p>
<h3><a name="594"></a>5.9.4. Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Goods and services provided by many arctic regions depend on the physical integrity 
  of permafrost and therefore are vulnerable to warming-induced thermokarst. The 
  large carbon stocks in these regions are vulnerable to loss to the atmosphere 
  as CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub>, which could act as positive feedbacks to 
  global warming. A few key taxa of animals&#151;such as reindeer, caribou, and 
  waterfowl&#151;are critical cultural resources. Often these taxa are concentrated 
  in particular habitats, such as riparian areas or high-Arctic oases. Ecological 
  changes that modify the population dynamics of these species or modify the impact 
  on their habitats could have important social consequences. </p>
<p>High levels of endemism in many alpine flora and their inability to migrate 
  upward mean that these species are most vulnerable. In addition, alpine soils 
  are vulnerable to losses from erosion, which would radically reduce the goods 
  and services that these regions could provide.</p>
