<h4><a name="15329"></a>15.3.2.9. U.S.-Mexican Border</h4>
<p>The U.S.-Mexican border is characterized by a semi-arid climate, with higher 
  precipitation toward both coasts. Evaporation exceeds precipitation for many 
  months of the year, causing a soil moisture deficit. Many studies relate climate 
  and hydrology along the U.S. border states (Green and Sellers, 1964; Hastings 
  and Turner, 1965; Norwine, 1978; Cayan and Peterson, 1989) and along the Mexican 
  border states (Mosi&ntilde;o and Garc&iacute;a, 1973; Schmidt, 1975; Acosta, 
  1988; Cavazos, 1998). The western border has an annual rainfall of about 250 
  mm yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small>, with temperatures ranging from 10 to 28&deg;C. 
  The Arizona-Sonora border has a much more extreme and desert climate, with only 
  80 mm yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small> of precipitation and maximum temperatures 
  reaching 45&deg;C. Around the Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)-El Paso (Texas) border, 
  annual precipitation is around 220 mm, with maximum temperatures reaching 40&deg;C. 
  Finally, in the easternmost part of the border (Brownsville, Texas-Matamoros, 
  Mexico), annual precipitation is close to 675 mm, with temperatures ranging 
  from 11 to 38&deg;C.</p>
<p>There is large climate variability along the U.S.-Mexican border states. 
  Drought and floods occur frequently (Powell Consortium, 1995), some influenced 
  by the occurrence of El Ni&ntilde;o (Cavazos and Hastenrath, 1990; Cayan and 
  Webb, 1992). The Mexican states along the border are highly vulnerable to drought, 
  particularly along the Rio Grande region, areas with low precipitation rates 
  (less then a 100 mm yr<small><sup>-1</sup></small>) (Mundo and Mart&iacute;nez 
  Austria, 1993; Hern&aacute;ndez, 1995; Mendoza <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997). Strong 
  El Ni&ntilde;o events during the summer result in severe water deficit in northern 
  Mexico (Maga&ntilde;a and Quintanar, 1997), and serious negative impacts in 
  agricultural activities. Such vulnerable conditions during drought periods have 
  resulted in legal disputes between Mexico and the state of Texas with regard 
  to rights to Rio Grande water.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the signs of future changes in precipitation and water availability 
  will be along the border (Mearns <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1995; Maga&ntilde;a <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1997; Mendoza <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997). Some scenarios suggest increased winter 
  precipitation and decreased summer precipitation (Maga&ntilde;a <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1998). Without reliable predictions of precipitation changes across drainage 
  basins, little confidence can be placed in hypothesized effects of global warming 
  on annual runoff (Karl and Riebsame, 1989). Therefore, to examine potential 
  impacts of climate change on water availability, most studies make use of long 
  instrumental records of precipitation and streamflow. Some analyses indicate 
  that in recent decades there is a positive trend in streamflow and even precipitation, 
  corresponding to more water availability along the U.S.-Mexican border 
  (Maga&ntilde;a <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998; Maga&ntilde;a and Conde, 2000). However, 
  demand for water in agriculture, industries, and cities is increasing steadily, 
  surpassing recent increases in water availability (Mundo and Mart&iacute;nez 
  Austria, 1994).</p>
<p>The signal of climate change along the U.S.-Mexican border may be exacerbated 
  along the Mexican side by differences in land use. Along the U.S. side, the 
  presence of gardens and green areas lead to a cooler environment relative to 
  the Mexican side. Currently, maximum temperatures in contiguous border towns 
  may differ by as much as 3&deg;C as a result of different characteristics in 
  vegetation (Balling, 1988). This cross-border contrast is possible because water 
  consumption in U.S. border cities is four times larger than in Mexican border 
  cities. Surface water distribution along the border (Rio Grande and Colorado 
  watersheds) is regulated by the Binational Treaty of 1944. Yet, there are no 
  regulations for subsurface water (Sanchez, 1994).</p>
<h4><a name="153210"></a>15.3.2.10. The U.S.-Caribbean Border</h4>
<p>Some of the U.S.-Caribbean border problems that may increase as a result 
  of climate change are related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Effects of sea-level changes on coastal ecosystems</li>
  <li>Effects of temperature increases on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, 
    including possible effects on economically important species </li>
  <li>Effects of climate change on socioeconomic structures and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the high population density in part of the Caribbean islands and 
  coastal areas, human settlements will be highly affected by sea-level rise and 
  saline intrusion (Vincente <i>et al</i>., 1993). Coral reefs in the region may 
  be severely affected by coral bleaching induced by warmer water temperatures 
  (Milliman, 1993).</p>
<p>Tourism is a major economic activity in most of the region. A change in rainfall 
  patterns, tropical storms, and warming of the climate in temperate countries 
  may affect the comparative advantages of this sector in the region (Alm <i>et 
  al</i>., 1993). Narrow beaches combined with projected sea-level rise contribute 
  to the vulnerability of the tourism sector to changes in climate (Gable, 1997).</p>
<p>Potential consequences of changes in extreme events (e.g., hurricanes) are 
  not well-defined. Other trends, such as changing demographic patterns, may exacerbate 
  impacts. Recent large losses of life from rainfall-induced floods, mudflows, 
  and landslides reflect increasing concentrations of residents in high risk areas 
  (Rodriguez, 1997; Pulwarty, 1998).</p>
