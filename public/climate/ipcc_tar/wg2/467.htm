<p><a name="fig121"></a>Most recent impact studies for Australia and New Zealand 
  have been based on scenarios released by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
  Research Organisation (CSIRO, 1996a) or the National Institute of Water and 
  Atmosphere (NIWA&#151;Renwick <i>et al.</i>, 1998b). The CSIRO (1996a) scenarios 
  included two sets of rainfall scenarios that are based on results from equilibrium 
  slab-ocean general circulation model (GCM) and transient coupled ocean-atmosphere 
  GCM (AOGCM) simulations. Some impact and adaptation studies since RICC have 
  used results from a 140-year simulation over the whole region that uses the 
  CSIRO regional climate model (RCM) at 125-km resolution nested in the CSIRO 
  Mark 2 coupled GCM run in transient mode from 1961 to 2100, as well as similar 
  simulations at 60-km resolution over eastern Australia. <a href="#fig121">Figure 
  12-1</a> (from Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 2001) summarizes results of slab-ocean 
  and coupled AOGCM simulations of rainfall changes for various subregions of 
  Australia in summer (December-January-February, DJF) and winter (JJA), respectively.</p>
<p><a href="#fig121">Figures 12-1a</a> and <a href="#fig121">12-1b</a> clearly 
  show a variety of estimates for different model simulations; nevertheless, there 
  is a tendency toward more decreases in winter rainfall in the southwest and 
  the central eastern coast of Australia in the coupled model results than in 
  the slab-ocean model results and a similar tendency for more agreement between 
  coupled model results on less rainfall in the northwest and central west in 
  summer.</p>
<p>In line with WGI conclusions, more recent scenarios, such as those of Hulme 
  and Sheard (1999) and Carter <i>et al.</i> (2000) rely exclusively on coupled 
  models; they also are based on the newer emissions scenarios from the IPCC's 
  <i>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</i> (SRES) rather than the IS92 scenarios 
  described in IPCC (1996). This leads to some changes in the regional scenarios. 
  According to Whetton (1999), the CSIRO (1996a) scenarios give warmings of 0.3-1.4&deg;C 
  in 2030 and 0.6-3.8&deg;C in 2070 relative to 1990, compared to estimates 
  by Hulme and Sheard (1999) of 0.8-3.9&deg;C by the 2050s and 1.0-5.9&deg;C 
  in the 2080s, relative to the 1961-1990 averages. As discussed by Whetton 
  (1999), both sets of scenarios use results from several coupled models, but 
  the use of the SRES emissions scenarios leads to greater warmings in Hulme and 
  Sheard (1999) than those that are based on the IS92 emission scenarios in CSIRO 
  (1996). Nevertheless, the Hulme and Sheard (1999) results are preliminary in 
  that they use scaled results from non-SRES simulations, rather than actual GCM 
  simulations with SRES emissions.</p>
<p>Rainfall scenarios that are based on the coupled model results in CSIRO (1996a) 
  show decreases of 0-8% in 2030 and 0-20% in 2070, except in southern 
  Victoria and Tasmania in winter and eastern Australia in summer, where rainfall 
  changes by -4 to +4% in 2030 and -10 to +10% in 2070. The Hulme and 
  Sheard (1999) scenarios suggest that annual precipitation averaged over either 
  northern or southern Australia is likely to change by -25 to +5%. Larger 
  decreases are indicated for the 2080s and for some specific locations (e.g., 
  a 50% decrease in parts of the southwest of western Australia in winter). This 
  last finding suggests that even though the rainfall decrease in this region 
  in the late 20th century was almost certainly dominated by natural variability 
  (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 2000), a decreasing trend resulting from the enhanced 
  greenhouse effect may dominate in this region by the mid- to late 21st century.</p>
<p>It is important to note that changing from joint use of equilibrium slab-ocean 
  GCM and transient coupled AOGCM results to exclusive reliance on coupled model 
  results in the Australian scenarios leads to a marked narrowing of the uncertainty 
  range in rainfall changes predicted for southern Australia, with a tendency 
  to more negative changes on the mainland (see <a href="#fig121">Figure 12-1</a>; 
  Hulme and Sheard, 1999; Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2000). This means that the results 
  of impact studies that used the wider range of rainfall scenarios, as in the 
  CSIRO (1996a) scenarios (e.g., Schreider <i>et al.</i>, 1996), should be reinterpreted 
  to focus on the drier end of the previous range. This is consistent with more 
  recent studies by Kothavala (1999) and Arnell (1999). </p>
<p>To summarize the rainfall results, drier conditions are anticipated for most 
  of Australia over the 21st century. However, consistent with conclusions in 
  WGI, an increase in heavy rainfall also is projected, even in regions with small 
  decreases in mean rainfall. This is a result of a shift in the frequency distribution 
  of daily rainfall toward fewer light and moderate events and more heavy events. 
  This could lead to more droughts and more floods.</p>
<p>Recent Australian impact studies have tended to use regional scenarios of temperature 
  and rainfall changes per degree of global warming, based on the CSIRO RCM transient 
  simulations, scaled to the range of uncertainty of the global warming derived 
  from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) range of scenarios. For example, 
  Hennessy <i>et al.</i> (1998) gives scenarios for six regions of New South Wales 
  (NSW), based on a 60-km resolution simulation. Ranges are given for estimated 
  changes in maximum and minimum temperatures, summer days over 35&deg;C, winter 
  days below 0&deg;C, seasonal mean rainfall changes, and numbers of extremely 
  wet or dry seasons per decade. Statistical downscaling (discussed in detail 
  in <i>et al.</i> 3) has not been used extensively in Australia apart from work 
  by Charles <i>et al.</i> ( 1999) on the southwest of western Australia. It should 
  be noted that in some cases, RCM results may change the sign of rainfall changes 
  derived from coarser resolution GCMs, because of local topographic and other 
  effects (Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 2001).</p>
<p>New Zealand scenarios reported in RICC (Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998) are based 
  on statistical downscaling from equilibrium GCM runs with CO<sub>2</sub> held 
  constant at twice its present concentration. Renwick <i>et al.</i> (1998b, 2000) 
  also have downscaled equilibrium GCM simulations over New Zealand, using a nested 
  RCM. </p>
<p>A key factor in rainfall scenarios for New Zealand is the strength of the mid-latitude 
  westerlies because of the strong orographic influence of the backbone mountain 
  ranges lying across this flow (Wratt <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Earlier equilibrium 
  slab-ocean GCM runs (applicable only long after stabilization of climate change) 
  and the regional simulations obtained by downscaling them through statistical 
  and nested modeling techniques predict a weakening of the westerlies across 
  New Zealand, particularly in winter. As a result, downscaled equilibrium model 
  runs predict that winter precipitation will remain constant or decrease slightly 
  in the west but increase in Otago and Southland (Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 1996a; 
  Renwick <i>et al.</i>, 2000). In contrast, transient coupled AOGCM runs suggest 
  that over the next 100 years or more, the mean strength of the westerlies actually 
  will increase in the New Zealand region, particularly in winter (Whetton <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1996a; Russell and Rind, 1999; Mpelasoka <i>et al.</i>, 2001). As a 
  result, downscaled transient model results predict that rainfalls will increase 
  in the west of New Zealand but decrease in the east (Mullan <i>et al.</i>, 2001) 
  as shown in <a href="#fig122">Figure 12-2</a>. Slightly larger temperature increases 
  are predicted in the north of the country than in the south. Projected temporal 
  changes in the westerlies before and after stabilization of climate also are 
  likely to influence rainfall in southern Australia, especially in Tasmania. 
</p>
GCM simulations extending beyond the stabilization of GHG concentrations indicate 
that global warming continues for centuries after stabilization of concentrations 
(Wigley, 1995; Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 1998; <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/338.htm">Chapters 
9</a> and <a href="../wg1/408.htm">11</a>) but at a much reduced rate as the oceans gradually 
catch up with the stabilized radiative forcing. Importantly for the Australasian 
region, simulated patterns of warming and rainfall changes in the southern hemisphere 
change dramatically after stabilization of GHG concentrations. This is because 
of a reversal of the lag in warming of the Southern Ocean relative to the rest 
of the globe. This lag increases up to stabilization but decreases after stabilization 
(Whetton <i>et al.</i>, 1998), with consequent reversal of changes in the north-south 
temperature gradient, the mid-latitude westerlies, and associated rainfall patterns.<br clear="all">
