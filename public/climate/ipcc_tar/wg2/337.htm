<h2>8.4. Impacts and the Role of the Banking Industry </h2>
<p>In the private sector, the insurance and banking industries play leading roles 
  as investors, although they focus on different aspects of this business. The 
  role of banks is to cover the credit part (by providing loans), whereas insurance 
  companies act as investors on the capital markets, as well as in the property/ 
  casualty branches; they also insure projects financed by banks. This section 
  focuses on the banking industry.</p>
<h3><a name="841"></a>8.4.1. Climate Change Impacts </h3>
<p>Environmental issues such as climate change may have substantive impacts on 
  the global economy. From a financial point of view, such problems are regarded 
  as environmentally induced economic risks (Figge, 1998). In general, the size 
  of the players, their diversification, and increasingly sophisticated techniques 
  of risk reduction make it unlikely that banks and asset managers will perceive 
  climate change as presenting any material threat to their economic viability. 
</p>
<p>On the positive side, banks could provide services and develop financing techniques 
  that accommodate and facilitate adaptation to weather extremes (e.g., private 
  insurance, catastrophe bonds, weather-related trading). Assessment of expected 
  benefits of an investment decision&#151;whether it is a direct investment, through 
  financing of an infrastructure project, or an indirect investment that involves 
  investing in shares&#151;is core to financial institutions. Economic assessment 
  of an investment is based on three different factors: expected revenues, operating 
  costs, and risks. Climate change can have an impact on all three aspects but 
  is probably more important for the risk side of an investment decision (Figge, 
  1998; Mag, 1990).</p>
<p><i>Lending and Climate Change</i></p>
<p>Most private and corporate loans are secured by property. If a region becomes 
  more exposed to climate-related natural disasters such as floods or windstorms, 
  the prices for property could go down&#151;which could result in a loss of confidence 
  in the local economy and may even trigger a credit crunch (Grabbe, 1998; Heinz 
  Center, 2000). As an indirect effect, other types of business such as management 
  of private assets and granting of private loans that are not backed by property 
  also will be affected (Bender, 1991; Thompson, 1996).</p>
<p>In terms of the impacts of climate change on the banking industry, there is 
  no clear scientific evidence on how this sector will be affected. One view is 
  that the banking sector is likely to be largely unaffected by climate change 
  because the sector increasingly transfers loans directly to the capital market 
  through asset-backed securities and similar instruments. The major commercial 
  banks are large and diversified and are getting more so as the industry concentrates 
  in the face of global competition. They prefer not to keep any substantial portion 
  of the loans they make on a long-term basis. Instead, driven by capital constraints 
  and return requirements, they actively syndicate and/or securitize their loan 
  commitments (i.e., sell down the loans or shift the loan exposure to other banks 
  and institutions). Even the portion they retain is increasingly likely to be 
  held for a shorter period of time (a maturity under 1 year is better from a 
  capital requirement standpoint) than other institutional lenders such as insurance 
  companies and pension funds. The question still remains: At the end of the day, 
  who will bear the risk of climate change on investments? It is particularly 
  the insurance and asset management sectors that invest in asset-backed securities. 
  So the insurance industry may even get hit twice, first through direct losses 
  in property-related claims but also through impacts on their investments (Salt, 
  2000). Detailed information on what this increased vulnerability means for insurers 
  and asset managers must be further explored.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is obvious that banks could be affected indirectly as 
  climate change affects their customers' operations, consumption, and financial 
  circumstances. Any investment activity could be affected if property insurers 
  withdraw coverage or drastically increase premiums, as happened in Florida and 
  the Caribbean. Sectors that are likely to be affected by a drastic change in 
  the local climate are agriculture and tourism. Warm winters in Europe already 
  have negatively impacted the performance of skiing resorts in the Alps and have 
  led some banks to review their credit applications in view of possible impacts 
  of climate change (Credit Suisse Group, 1999)</p>
