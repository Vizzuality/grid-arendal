<h3>6.6.4. Adaptation in Marine Ecosystems</h3>
<p>Adaptation of the fishing industry to climate change is closely connected with 
  investigations of the consequences of the effect of climatic anomalies and climate 
  change scenarios. Because the effects of changes in climate factors will have 
  different consequences for various species, development of special measures 
  aimed at adaptation of the fish industry is regional in character and falls 
  into the category of important socioeconomic problems.</p>
<p>Possible adverse effects of climate change can be aggravated by an inadequate 
  utilization of fish reserves. For example, if a fish stock decreases as a result 
  of the combined effect of climate change and overfishing, and the commercial 
  catch remains high, species abundance may decrease dramatically and the commercial 
  catch may become unprofitable. In such circumstances, some measures may need 
  to be taken to protect fish reserves, such as the precautionary measures suggested 
  by O'Brien <i><i>et al.</i></i> (2000) to give the North Sea cod fishery a chance 
  to rebuild. Several sustainability indicators of marine capture species are 
  discussed in Garcia and Staples (2000). Aquaculture also can be regarded as 
  an adaptation; though to be an ecologically sustainable industry, it must emphasize 
  an integrated approach to management (Carvalho and Clarke, 1998). Another adaptation 
  is fish stock enhancement through ocean ranching (see <a href="290.htm#636">Section 
  6.3.6</a>).</p>
<p>Fish reserves rank among the most important economic resources in many countries. 
  Approximately 95% of the world catch falls within the 200-mile economic zones 
  of maritime states. Environmental impacts in those zones as a consequence of 
  climate change could affect the catch volume and national economies. It should 
  be noted that gains and losses at different levels of social organization can 
  occur not only as a consequence of climate change but also as a result of human 
  society's responses to this change. In some regions, for instance, special 
  measures may be taken to promote adaptation and to reduce the negative consequences 
  of climate change&#151;which adds another dimension to fish management.</p>
<p>Adaptation measures that are relevant to the fishing industry may include the 
  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishment of national and international fishery management institutions 
  that will be able to manage expected changes
  <li>Expansion of aquaculture as a way of meeting increasing demand for seafoods 
  of an increasing world population
  <li>Support for innovative research and integrated management of fisheries 
  within coastal and open marine ecosystems
  <li>Improvement and development of an integrated monitoring system in the 
  most productive areas, aimed at obtaining systematic information on hydrophysical, 
  hydrochemical, and hydrobiological processes
  <li>Organization of data banks on the results of integrated ecological monitoring 
  to identify anthropogenic changes, including climate change, and predict fish 
  productivity
  <li>Modification and improvement of the technology of the fishing industry 
  and management of the fish trade as required to adapt to climate change
  <li>Organization of marine biosphere reserves and protected areas for the 
  habitat of marine mammals
  <li>Use of emerging predictive information related to natural climate variability 
  (e.g., ENSO) to support fishery management and planning.
</ul>
<p>Adoption of some adaptation options to the potential impacts of climate change 
  is not a panacea, however. Fish often are transboundary resources in that they 
  may cross international and state boundaries in their oceanic migrations. In 
  the case of Pacific salmon, for instance, problems have arisen in the agreement 
  between the United States and Canada that are attributable in part to the effects 
  of large-scale climate fluctuations (see <a href="289.htm#box6-1">Box 6-1</a>). 
  Miller (2000) suggests that the Pacific salmon case demonstrates that it may 
  not be a simple matter for the fishing industry or governments to respond effectively 
  to climate change. She concludes that adaptation is difficult when a resource 
  is exploited by multiple competing users who possess incomplete information 
  about the resource. If their incentives to cooperate are disrupted by the impacts 
  of climate variation, dysfunctional breakdown in management rather than efficient 
  adaptation may occur (Miller, 2000).</p>
