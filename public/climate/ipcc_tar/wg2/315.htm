<h2>7.5. Management and Adaptation of Human Settlements </h2>
<p>Social and natural sustainability are important for sustainable development 
  of human settlements (Yoshino, 1994). Coping with flooding and drought; getting 
  potable water, breathable air, and a stable environment; and so forth have been 
  prime concerns of urban planners, engineers, governments, and citizenry for 
  thousands of years (Priscoli, 1998). Climate change simply adds to the challenge. 
  Some of the adaptations probably would take place autonomously, but some adaptations 
  may be much improved by taking climate into account explicitly (Wood et al., 
  1997). </p>
<h3><a name="751"></a>7.5.1. Adaptation </h3>
<p>Questions such as "adapt to what?", "who or what adapts?", and "how does adaptation 
  occur?" (Smit et al., 1998) are still difficult to answer in a strict sense. 
  Management, adaptation, and vulnerabilities have been discussed for settlements 
  in coastal (Fukuma, 1999/2000), arid, agrarian (Douguédroit, 1997; Douguédroit 
  et al., 1997; Le Treut 1997), and urban regions (Maunder, 1995). To be successful, 
  adaptations must be consistent with economic development, they must be environmentally 
  and socially sustainable over time, and they must be equitable (that is, not 
  have significantly deleterious effects on disadvantaged groups) (Munasinhge, 
  2000). </p>
<h3><a name="752"></a>7.5.2. Adaptation to What and Why? </h3>
<p>In most cases, human settlements have designed into them the ability to withstand 
  most of the consequences of some environmental variability. In most regions, 
  climate change would change the probability of certain weather conditions. The 
  only effect for which average change would be important is sea-level rise, under 
  which there could be increased risk of inundation of coastal settlements from 
  average (higher) sea levels. Human settlements for the most part would have 
  to adapt to more or less frequent or intense rain conditions or more or less 
  frequent mild winters and hot summers, although individual days' weather may 
  be well within the range of current weather variability and thus not require 
  exceptionally costly adaptation measures. The larger, more costly impacts of 
  climate change on human settlements would occur through increased (or decreased) 
  probability of extreme weather events that overwhelm the designed resiliency 
  of human systems. </p>
<p>Much of the management of urban centers as well as the governance structures 
  that direct and oversee them are related to reducing environmental hazards, 
  including those posed by extreme weather events and other natural hazards. Most 
  regulations and management practices related to buildings, land use, waste management, 
  and transportation have important environmental aspects. So too do most public 
  and private investments in infrastructure. A significant part of health care 
  and emergency services exists to limit the health impacts of environmental hazards. 
  Local capacity to limit environmental hazards or their health consequences in 
  any settlement generally implies local capacity to adapt to climate change, 
  unless adaptation implies particularly expensive infrastructure investment. 
</p>
<p>An increasing number of urban centers are developing more comprehensive plans 
  to manage the environmental implications of urban development. Many techniques 
  can contribute to better environmental planning and management including: market-based 
  tools for pollution control, demand management and waste reduction, mixed-use 
  zoning and transport planning (with appropriate provision for pedestrians and 
  cyclists), environmental impact assessments, capacity studies, strategic environmental 
  plans, environmental audit procedures, and state-of-the-environment reports 
  (Haughton, 1999). Many cities have used a combination of these techniques in 
  developing "Local Agenda 21s." Many Local Agenda 21s deal with a list of urban 
  problems that could closely interact with climate change in the future. Examples 
  of these problems include (WRI, 1996; Velasquez, 1998): </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Transport and road infrastructure systems that are inappropriate to the 
    settlement's topography (could be damaged by landslides or flooding with climate 
    change) 
  <li>Dwellings that are located in high-risk locations for floods, landslides, 
    air and water pollution, or disease (vulnerable to flood or landslides; disease 
    vectors more likely) 
  <li>Industrial contamination of rivers, lakes, wetlands, or coastal zones (vulnerable 
    to flooding) 
  <li>Degradation of landscape (interacts with climate change to produce flash 
    floods or desertification) 
  <li>Shortage of green spaces and public recreation areas (enhanced heat island 
    effects) 
  <li>Lack of education, training, or effective institutional cooperation in environmental 
    management (lack of adaptive capacity). 
</ul>
<h3><a name="753"></a>7.5.3. Sustainable Cities Activities </h3>
<p>The following generic lessons from Curitiba, Brazil-which come from the context 
  of "sustainable cities" under existing conditions-may be applicable to future 
  adaptation responses (Rabinovitch, 1998): </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Top priority should be given to public transportation rather than to automobiles 
    and other light-duty vehicles, and to pedestrians and cyclists rather than 
    to motorized vehicles. This reduces air pollution and some other forms of 
    pollution. It was noted that some alternative fuels such as hydrogen are particularly 
    attractive for reducing local air quality problems, as well as mitigating 
    GHG emissions. 
  <li>There can be an action plan for each set of urban problems, but solutions 
    within a city are connected, not isolated. 
  <li>Action plans must be participatory, with partnerships involving all responsible 
    parties [government, private sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), 
    individuals]. 
  <li>Creativity can substitute for financial resources (labor-intensive and creative 
    ideas can substitute for capital). 
  <li>Even during rapid demographic growth, physical expansion can be guided by 
    integrated road planning, investment in public transportation, and enforcement 
    of appropriate land-use legislation. 
  <li>Technological solutions and standards for everything from public transit 
    to recycling should be chosen on the basis of affordability (cost-effectiveness, 
    combined with sensitivity to total cost). 
  <li>Public information and awareness are essential. 
</ul>
<p>The most effective pathways for adaptation that result in sustainable development 
  are likely to arise out of an informed evolution of existing institutions. Several 
  authors emphasize the importance of the support and will of local public officials 
  in developing successful environmental solutions (e.g., Gilbert et al., 1996: 
  Foronda, 1998). Others emphasize the need in traditional societies to build 
  from and integrate modern techniques into traditional management practices and 
  kinship and community networks, to effectively collect and disseminate data 
  needed for assessing impacts, to open public participation processes for formulating 
  policy, and to provide a process for strengthening financial, legal, institutional, 
  and technical elements (Huang, 1997).</p>
