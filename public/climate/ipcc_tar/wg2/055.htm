<h2>1.1. Overview of the Assessment</h2>
<p>The world community faces many risks from climate change. Clearly, it is important 
  to understand the nature of those risks, where natural and human systems are 
  likely to be most vulnerable, and what may be achieved by adaptive responses. 
  To understand better the potential impacts and associated dangers of global 
  climate change, Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  (IPCC) offers this Third Assessment Report (TAR) on the state of knowledge concerning 
  the sensitivity, adaptability, and vulnerability of physical, ecological, and 
  social systems to climate change. Building on the Second Assessment Report (SAR), 
  this new report reexamines key findings of the earlier assessment and emphasizes 
  new information and implications on the basis of more recent studies. </p>
<p>Human activities-primarily burning of fossil fuels and changes in land cover-are 
  modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents or properties of the 
  Earth's surface that absorb or scatter radiant energy. In particular, increases 
  in the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols are strongly implicated 
  as contributors to climatic changes observed during the 20th century and are 
  expected to contribute to further changes in climate in the 21st century and 
  beyond. These changes in atmospheric composition are likely to alter temperatures, 
  precipitation patterns, sea level, extreme events, and other aspects of climate 
  on which the natural environment and human systems depend. </p>
<p>One of several primary issues this report has been organized to address is 
  a key question before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC): What are the potential impacts for societies and ecosystems of different 
  atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols that absorb and scatter sunlight 
  (United Nations, 1992)? Answering this question is a necessary step in assessing 
  what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system." 
  This report does not make any judgments about what level of concentrations is 
  "dangerous" because that is not a question of science per se but a value judgment 
  about relative risks and tradeoffs. The task is to make the evidence about relative 
  risks as clear as possible. This report therefore describes what is known about 
  the distribution of impacts; how, why, and to what extent they differ from region 
  to region or place to place; and how this relates to the distribution of vulnerability 
  and capacity to adapt. However, it critically assesses the literature to help 
  inform policymakers about effects associated with different concentration levels, 
  so they may judge what levels of risk are acceptable. Assessment of what constitutes 
  dangerous interference in the climate systems will require analysis of the interactions 
  of climate change and social and economic conditions, which are inextricably 
  linked. Understanding the role of socioeconomic factors, particularly adaptive 
  responses and capacity, is critical. </p>

<a name="fig11"></a>Part of the justification for a TAR at this time is the abundance 
of new evidence that has come to the attention of the expert community since publication 
of the SAR. The evidence is drawn predominantly from published, peer-reviewed 
scientific literature. Evidence also is drawn from published, non-peer-reviewed 
literature and unpublished sources such as industry journals; reports of government 
agencies, research institutions, and other organizations; proceedings of workshops; 
working papers; and unpublished data sets. The quality and validity of information 
from non-peer-reviewed and unpublished sources have been assessed by authors of 
this report prior to inclusion of information from these sources in the report. 
The procedures for the use of information from non-peer-reviewed and unpublished 
sources are described in IPCC (1999a) and discussed in Skodvin (2000). 
<p>Although this report builds on previous assessments, including the SAR and 
  the IPCC's Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (IPCC, 1998), 
  the TAR departs from them in important respects. In comparison to previous assessments, 
  greater attention is given to climate change adaptation; multiple pressures 
  on systems; links between climate change, sustainable development, and equity; 
  and characterization of the state-of-the-science and confidence levels associated 
  with key conclusions of the assessment (see <a href="#box11">Box 1-1</a>). This 
  overview chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive summary of the 
  principal findings of the TAR, but it helps to illustrate basic concepts by 
  selectively reporting on a few key conclusions, as well as providing a more 
  comprehensive road map to the materials presented later in the report: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Part I sets the stage for assessment of impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability 
    by discussing the context of climate change, methods for research on impacts, 
    and development of scenarios. These are important additions to what was emphasized 
    in the SAR. Consideration of the context of change (in this chapter) draws 
    attention to the relationship of climate change and sustainable development, 
    including interactions of climate variability and change with other environmental 
    changes and evolving demographic, social, and economic conditions that affect 
    driving forces of change and resources available for adaptation. Assessment 
    of methods (<a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>) and approaches for developing 
    and applying scenarios (<a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>) cover scientific 
    and technical aspects of research on impacts, providing a review of the science 
    underlying the topics covered in other chapters of the report.</li>
  <li>Part II assesses recent advances in experimental work, observations, and 
    modeling that contribute to the current state of knowledge of baseline trends, 
    vulnerabilities, and adaptation options in six sectors or resource areas. 
    This section of the report integrates material that had been covered in 18 
    chapters in the SAR, focusing to a greater extent on cross-sectoral issues. 
    For example, <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>, Ecosystems and their Goods and 
    Services, integrates what had been separate chapters on forests, rangelands, 
    deserts, mountain regions, wetlands, agriculture, food security, and other 
    systems; it also adds assessment of climate change impacts on wildlife-an 
    issue not covered in the SAR. Integrating these issues into a single chapter 
    provides an opportunity for improved assessment of interactions across these 
    systems, the effects of change on landscapes, and the distribution of land 
    use and cover. Information on the impacts of natural variability and the potential 
    for nonlinear interactions also is included in the chapters in Part II. </li>
  <li> Chapters in Part III build on key findings of the IPCC's Special Report 
    on Regional Impacts of Climate Change. Each chapter and subchapter in this 
    part of the report explores what has been learned regarding the context of 
    change, sensitivity, adaptation, and vulnerability of key sectors. A chapter 
    is devoted to each of eight regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Australia 
    and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, polar regions, and 
    small island states (see <a href="#fig11">Figure 1-1</a>). These regions are 
    chosen to correspond to continents or-in the case of polar regions and small 
    island states-to bring together in one chapter areas that share important 
    attributes related to climate change vulnerability. This regionalization of 
    the world is convenient for organizing the report, but it must be recognized 
    that there is a high degree of heterogeneity within each of these regions 
    in terms of climate, ecosystems, culture, and social, economic, and political 
    systems. Consequently, climate change impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability 
    vary markedly within each of these regions. These chapters provide an opportunity 
    to place vulnerability and adaptation in the context of multiple stresses 
    and regional resources for adaptation. This is an extremely important development 
    because it calls attention to the issues that regional and local decisionmakers 
    in the private and public sectors will be facing in each of the regions. </li>

      <p align="center"><b>Box 1-1 Uncertainties and Confidence Scale </b></p>
      <p>The many conclusions presented in this report are subject to varying 
        degrees of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty attached to conclusions 
        in this report are assessed and reported in two different ways. One is 
        to assess and report a confidence level for a conclusion, using a Bayesian 
        probability framework. (Bayesian assessments of probability distributions 
        would lead to the following interpretation of probability statements: 
        The probability of an event is the degree of belief that exists among 
        lead authors and reviewers that the event will occur, given observations, 
        modeling results, and theory currently available.) The second is to assess 
        and report the quality or level of scientific understanding that supports 
        a conclusion.</p>
      <p> The 5-point confidence scale below is used to assign confidence levels 
        to selected conclusions. The confidence levels are stated as Bayesian 
        probabilities, meaning that they represent the degree of belief among 
        the authors of the report in the validity of a conclusion, based on their 
        collective expert judgment of all observational evidence, modeling results, 
        and theory currently available to them. </p>

<p>Areas of important new findings include detection of impacts of observed climatic 
  changes on environmental systems, transient scenarios, vulnerability to changes 
  in climate variability, and vulnerability to strongly nonlinear, complex, and 
  discontinuous responses to climate change. Another distinction from previous 
  assessments is the recognition in the TAR that the many complexities of analysis 
  logically lead to a focus on ranges of outcomes and characterizations, using 
  subjective probabilities of events, rather than primary emphasis on "best guesses," 
  point estimates, single "optimum," or aggregate conclusions. Finally, the TAR 
  has circulated cross-cutting "guidance papers" to all three working groups to 
  try to achieve more consistency in dealing with four areas: development, sustainability, 
  and equity; uncertainties; costing methodologies; and decision analytic frameworks 
  (see <a href="#box12">Box 1-2</a>). </p>
<p>The IPCC's charge to Working Group II for the TAR implies that consideration 
  of the impacts of climate change in the SAR is insufficient per se as a basis 
  for decisionmaking. In general, the SAR was able to address the implications 
  of climate change only for single economic sectors or environmental components. 
  With this in mind, <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a>-<a href="657.htm">19</a> 
  consider the various decision analysis framework tools to improve upon the responses 
  to the impacts of climate change provided in the SAR. In the current exercise, 
  not only are possible implications of climate change for the various economic 
  sectors or environmental components assessed, options to alleviate identified 
  impacts are investigated. In addition, direct and indirect costs of adaptation 
  options are explored, and an extensive assessment of direct and indirect benefits 
  is provided. Where monetary values can be assigned, CBA is employed to determine 
  the optimal value of adaptation measures, including sensitivity analysis to 
  critical parameters, and CEA is adopted to identify the least-cost solution 
  to targeted mitigation objectives. </p>

      <p align="center"><b>Box 1-2. Cross-Cutting Issues Guidance Papers </b></p>
      <p>Four cross-cutting guidance papers (Pachauri et al., 2000) were available 
        to all Lead Authors of all three IPCC working groups. Many of the concepts 
        in these papers were previously unfamiliar to a large number of the Lead 
        Authors. Significant efforts were made to incorporate the uncertainties 
        guidance and at least consider the guidance in other papers by each working 
        group. Future assessments will be increasingly able to benefit from the 
        suggestions and frameworks in these four cross-cutting guidance papers. 
      </p>
      <p><i><b>Development, Sustainability, and Equity (DSE) (Munasinghe, 2000) 
        </b></i></p>
      <p>DSE is relevant to Working Group II with respect to three questions: 
        How do development paths and equity conditions influence vulnerability 
        to climate change and the capacity to adapt to or cope with climate change? 
        How might climate change impacts and adaptation responses affect prospects 
        for attaining sustainable development and equity goals? What types of 
        policies are capable of reducing climate change vulnerability and promoting 
        sustainable development and equity objectives? </p>
      <p>DSE is a response to principles contained in UNFCCC Article 3.4 (to promote 
        sustainable development). Article 3.2 takes into account the special needs 
        and circumstances of developing countries. Article 4 deals, for example, 
        with the responsibility of developed nations, competing priorities for 
        developing nations, and "common, but differentiated responsibilities," 
        and Article 2 says to avoid "dangerous" interference with the climate 
        system (United Nations, 1992). DSE is closely tied to sustainable development 
        with respect to three underlying dimensions: economic, social, and environmental. 
      </p>
      <p>Development has been characterized as "qualitative improvement" (Ishida, 
        1998), including economic growth and social dimensions. Sustainability 
        of a system refers to its durability or its capacity to withstand and 
        recover from disturbances (WCED, 1987)-in other words, its resilience. 
        Equity refers to procedural as well as distributional issues. Procedural 
        issues relate to how decisions are made (e.g., internal equity and governance 
        structures within nations could have significant effects on adaptive capacity). 
        Distributional equity, on the other hand, relates to how the costs of 
        impacts, mitigation, and adaptation are shared. Equity considerations 
        are important in addressing global climate change for several reasons, 
        including moral and ethical concerns; facilitating cooperation because 
        equitable decisions carry greater legitimacy; the social dimension of 
        sustainable development; and the UNFCCC itself, which considers equity 
        as one of its basis principles (in Article 3.1). </p>
      <p>Climate change could undermine social welfare, equity, and the sustainability 
        of future development. In particular, it is generally believed that developing 
        countries and disadvantaged groups within all countries are more vulnerable 
        to the impacts of climate change (e.g., <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>) 
        as a result of limited resources and low adaptive capacity. </p>
      <p><b><i>Uncertainty (Moss and Schneider, 2000) </i></b></p>
      <p>Anticipating the imperfect nature of available information, UNFCCC Article 
        3.3 provides guidance to the effect that "where there are threats of serious 
        or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be 
        used as a reason for postponing measures to anticipate, prevent, or minimize 
        the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects" (United 
        Nations, 1992). The uncertainties guidance paper develops a unified approach 
        for assessing, characterizing, and reporting uncertainties in the TAR. 
        The most important contribution of the uncertainties guidance paper is 
        the construction of confidence schemes and qualitative terms to describe 
        the state of science, which are reproduced in Box 1-1. The goal is to 
        promote consistency in evaluating the judgments of scientific experts, 
        to facilitate communication of these judgments to nonspecialists, and 
        to provide peer-reviewed guidance for policymakers. Thus, a great deal 
        of importance is attached to assessing the scientific merit of information 
        in the literature and "explicitly distinguishing and communicating which 
        findings are well understood, which are somewhat understood, and which 
        are speculative" (Moss and Schneider, 1997). <a href="103.htm">Section 
        2.6</a> discusses in more detail the differences between the well-calibrated 
        ranges in the literature and the much larger, full range of uncertainty 
        as well as the cascade of uncertainty that occurs when ranges in climate 
        scenarios are cascaded with uncertainties in each successive step of assessment. 
        In <a href="159.htm">Chapters 4</a>-<a href="657.htm">19</a>, selected 
        findings are assigned levels of confidence, using either the scale for 
        assessing confidence level quantitatively or the matrix for assessing 
        the state of knowledge qualitatively. </p>
      <p>Especially in the regional chapters, uncertainty about future climate 
        is the dominant cause of uncertainty about the character and magnitude 
        of impacts. In such cases, confidence estimates are evaluated conditionally 
        on a specific climate change scenarios to avoid "cascades" (see <a href="108.htm#fig22">Figure 
        2-2</a>) in which confidence in the occurrence of an event does not include 
        compounded uncertainties in each factor that contributes to the final 
        outcome. Instead, the assessment evaluates each step in the cascade separately-what 
        is called a "traceable account"-and is particularly appropriate for any 
        aggregate conclusions. </p>

<p> The concluding section of this report (<a href="641.htm">Chapters 18</a> and 
  <a href="657.htm">19</a>) examines global issues and offers a synthesis. A significant 
  addition to previous assessments is <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>, which 
  is devoted to assessment of opportunities for and barriers to adaptation. This 
  chapter considers determinants of adaptive capacity; lessons from adaptation 
  to present-day climate variability and extremes; the potential effectiveness 
  of adaptation measures; and global-, national-, and local-scale options for 
  strengthening adaptive capacity, especially for vulnerable populations, countries, 
  or zones. <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a>, a synthesis, also is new to the 
  TAR. It draws on the analyses of other chapters, synthesizing information that 
  is important for interpretation of Article 2 of the UNFCCC and key provisions 
  of international agreements to address climate change. Potential global impacts 
  of different stabilization levels of atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are 
  assessed. <a href="657.htm">Chapter 19</a> assesses vulnerability within the 
  framework of sustainable development and equity, acknowledging common but differentiated 
  responsibilities. </p>
<p>The issue of what constitutes sustainable development was advanced in 1987 
  by the World Commission on Environment and Development (the so-called Brundtland 
  Commission; WCED, 1987). The commission defined sustainable development as "development 
  that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
  generations to meet their own needs" and notes that "even the narrow notion 
  of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, 
  a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation." 
  The goal of sustainable development is a stable human environmental system in 
  which available resources are sufficient to meet the needs of society in perpetuity. 
  Questions have been asked about whether "needs," as conceived in the Brundtland 
  Commission report, should be limited to environment-dependent basic necessities 
  of food, clothing, shelter, and health or should include more qualitative aspects 
  such as comfort, convenience, or other "quality of life" measures. There is 
  no consensus in the literature regarding what constitutes the limits of "needs" 
  in this context. </p>
<p>Because available studies have not employed a common set of climate scenarios 
  and methods and because of uncertainties regarding the sensitivities and adaptability 
  of natural and human-dominated systems, assessment of regional vulnerabilities 
  is necessarily qualitative. Whenever possible, quantitative estimates of the 
  impacts of climate change are cited in this report. Field or experimental data 
  often provide quantitative underpinnings for specific circumstances, but rarely 
  are complex systems sufficiently described by the limited number of cases in 
  which a large quantity of "hard data" is available. Thus, most quantitative 
  estimates are still dependent on the specific assumptions employed regarding 
  future changes in climate, as well as the particular methods and models applied 
  in the analyses. On the other hand, issues in which there is a great deal of 
  relevant field or lab data are likely to carry higher confidence in any such 
  quantitative estimate. To interpret these estimates, it is important to bear 
  in mind uncertainties regarding the character, magnitude, and rates of future 
  climate change that will affect society's degree of exposure. Of comparable 
  importance are uncertainties associated with future states of the human condition-for 
  example, the extent and quality of economic development throughout the world 
  and the evolution of traditions and institutions in societies-that will affect 
  profoundly the capacity for coping and adaptation, hence level of vulnerability. 
  These uncertainties impose limitations on the ability of the research community 
  to project the impacts of climate change, particularly at regional and smaller 
  scales. </p>
<p>This introductory chapter is organized to address a series of questions: What 
  is potentially at stake as a result of changes in climate (<a href="056.htm">Section 
  1.2</a>)? How has society responded to the risks and potential opportunities 
  (<a href="059.htm">Section 1.3</a>)? How are impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability 
  assessed in the report (<a href="060.htm">Section 1.4</a>)? How do the complexities 
  of analysis affect the assessment (<a href="063.htm">Section 1.5</a>)? How can 
  this assessment be used to address policy-relevant questions (<a href="066.htm">Section 
  1.6</a>)?</p>
