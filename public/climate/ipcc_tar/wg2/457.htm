<h4>11.3.2.4. Tropical Asia </h4>
<p>Agricultural adaptation to climatic variability is an evolving process. Planned 
  interventions through research, extension, or pricing or marketing policies 
  can have inadvertent detrimental impacts for poor farmers. Agricultural productivity 
  in tropical Asia is sensitive not only to temperature increases but also to 
  changes in the nature and characteristics of monsoons. An increase in leaf surface 
  temperatures would have significant effects on crop metabolism and yields, and 
  it may make crops more sensitive to moisture stress (Riha et al., 1996). Cropping 
  systems may have to change to include growing suitable cultivars (to counteract 
  compression of crop development), increasing crop intensities (i.e., the number 
  of successive crops produced per unit area per year), or planting different 
  types of crops (Sinha et al., 1998). Farmers will have to adapt to changing 
  hydrological regimes by changing crops. For example, farmers in Pakistan may 
  grow more sugarcane if additional water becomes available, and they may grow 
  less rice if water supplies dwindle. The yield ceiling must be raised and the 
  yield gap narrowed while maintaining sustainable production and a friendly environment. 
  Development of new varieties with higher yield potential and stability is complementary 
  to bridging the yield gap. Efficient production of a socially optimal level 
  of agricultural output in this region ultimately may depend on biotechnological 
  applications, but only if these applications prove to be environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>Groundwater is the main source of freshwater in many parts of tropical Asia, 
  particularly in semi-arid regions. Water resources already are limited in terms 
  of supply and demand in this region. The aquifers in most countries have been 
  depleted by high withdrawal and low recharge rates, and significant drawdown 
  problems exist. Even with increases in precipitation, surface runoff may diminish 
  in some river basins under projected climate change scenarios because of greater 
  evaporation in a warmer atmosphere (higher hydrological elasticity). Increased 
  runoff in some river basins can cause deleterious effects such as greater flooding, 
  waterlogging, and salinity. More than 25% of the irrigated land in the Indus 
  basin already is affected by waterlogging and salinization (Hillel, 1991). Freshwater 
  availability in the coastal regions is likely to undergo substantial changes 
  as a result of a series of chain effects. Improvements in runoff management 
  and irrigation technology (e.g., river runoff control by reservoirs, water transfers, 
  and land conservation practices) will be crucial. Increasing efforts should 
  be directed toward rainwater harvesting and other water-conserving practices 
  to slow the decline in water levels in aquifers. Recycling of wastewater should 
  be encouraged in drought-prone countries in tropical Asia. However, major water 
  development decisions to augment water supplies may have greater relative hydrological, 
  environmental, and social impacts than climate change per se in the shorter 
  term. Climate change will affect the benefits to be accrued by future water 
  development projects and therefore should be taken into consideration in the 
  context of water resource policies and planning.</p>
<p>With rapid development of the economy in several countries in tropical Asia 
  during recent decades, the patterns of land use and land cover have been modified 
  significantly; a sequence of transitions and conversions is discernable. As 
  a result of different natural and socioeconomic conditions, the speed and scale 
  of land-use change is very diverse in different parts of Asia. This process 
  has contributed to significant losses in total forest cover; changes in standing 
  biomass and the soil carbon budget; extinction of mammals, birds, and vascular 
  plants; soil degradation; and threats to food security. Excessive human and 
  livestock population pressure in association with inappropriate agricultural 
  extension activities also lend an explanation for widespread land degradation 
  in tropical Asia. Salinization and acidification of soil in low-lying coastal 
  areas would adversely affect cropland in addition to land losses from permanent 
  inundation of deltas from anticipated sea-level rise.</p>
<p>Many of the major rivers originating in mountains and highlands are charged 
  with sediments, depending on the types of land uses in the watersheds (e.g., 
  from forestry and agroforestry to open agriculture). Marginalization of production 
  areas in highlands will continue to increase soil losses, land slips, and slides 
  in the region. It has been suggested that upland micro-watersheds can be hydroecologically 
  sustainable only if good forest cover and dense forests are maintained (Rai, 
  1999). Under changing climate conditions, the pressure toward small- and large-scale 
  transfers of land for agricultural and urban uses may grow. </p>
<p>Sea-level rise poses the greatest threat and challenge for sustainable adaptation 
  within south and southeast Asia. The sea level already is rising in many locations, 
  primarily as a result of geological processes and anthropogenic manipulations. 
  Projected sea-level rise along the Asian coastlines represents an increase of 
  three to four times over present rates (Chansang, 1993; Midun and Lee, 1995; 
  Mimura and Harasawa, 2000). The potential impacts of accelerated sea-level rise 
  include inundation of low-lying deltas and estuaries, retreat of shorelines, 
  and changes in the water table (Wong, 1992; Sivardhana, 1993). Episodic flooding 
  from high storm surges would penetrate much further inland. Salinization and 
  acidification of soil in low-lying coastal areas will adversely affect agricultural 
  production, in addition to land losses from permanent inundation of deltas from 
  anticipated sea-level rise. The impacts will vary from region to region because 
  of local factors such as land subsidence, susceptibility to coastal erosion 
  or sedimentation, varying tidal ranges, and cyclonicity (Bird, 1993). The Ganges-Brahmaputra 
  in Bangladesh, the Irrawaddy in Myanmar, the Choo Phraya in Thailand, and the 
  Mekong and Song Hong in Vietnam are among the key low-lying river deltas in 
  tropical Asia that are most vulnerable to sea-level rise. Local-level social 
  and institutional adaptations in sensitive regions and development and promotion 
  of risk management can potentially prevent accelerated impacts to these deltas 
  through protection of the ecology of the region from further human interventions 
  so they can sustain themselves at least in a short time horizon. </p>
