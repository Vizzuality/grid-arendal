<h4>11.2.3.2. Water Needs and Management Implications </h4>
<p>At present, approximately 57% of total water withdrawal and 70% of water consumption 
  in the world occurs within the countries of Asia. <a href="439.htm#tab118">Table 
  11-8</a> presents the dynamics of freshwater use in Asia over the sectors of 
  economic activities. As is evident from this table, agriculture (irrigation 
  in particular) accounts for 81% of total water withdrawal and 91% of water consumption 
  in Asia. The area of irrigated lands in Asia currently amounts to 175 Mha and 
  may increase to 230 Mha by 2025. As <a href="438.htm#tab117">Table 11-7</a> 
  implies, the two most populated regions of south and southeast Asia account 
  for about 68% of water withdrawal and about 69% of water consumption in Asia 
  (see <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>). More than 75% of the total water available 
  in India currently is used for irrigation. As much as 20% is required to meet 
  domestic and municipal needs&#151;leaving just 5% for industrial needs. The 
  only river in north India that has surplus water to meet future needs of the 
  country is the Brahmaputra. This river, however, is an international river; 
  other countries such as Bangladesh may not approve of building a dam across 
  some of its tributaries. In peninsular India, only the Mahanadi and Godavari 
  have surplus water, but conveying it to drought-prone areas of the south is 
  problematic. Many states in India need to adopt measures for restricting the 
  use of groundwater to prevent a water famine in the future. China's rapid economic 
  growth, industrialization, and urbanization&#151;accompanied by inadequate infrastructure 
  investment and management capacity&#151;have contributed to widespread problems 
  of water scarcity throughout the country. Of the 640 major cities in China, 
  more than 300 face water shortages; 100 face severe scarcities (UNDP, 1997).</p>
<p>Taking into account projected dynamics of economic development in the temperate, 
  tropical, and arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, combined with the climate 
  change-imposed effect on hydrological regimes, agriculture and the public water 
  supply would require priority attention in these regions to secure sustainable 
  development and avoid potential intersectoral and international water conflicts. 
  Radical changes in water management strategies and substantial investments will 
  be required in Asia to cope with water problems in the 21st century. Adaptation 
  measures will include legal, institutional, and technical initiatives such as 
  modifying existing and constructing new infrastructure (reservoirs, interbasin 
  water transfer schemes), introducing water-saving technologies, upgrading efficiency 
  of irrigation systems, enhancing wastewater recycling systems, introducing low 
  water-use crops, and implementing groundwater protection programs. </p>
<p>At least 14 major international river watersheds exist in Asia. An integrated 
  and decentralized system of restoration and conservation of the water cycle 
  in these drainage basins is vital to mitigate the negative consequences of natural 
  and externally imposed perturbations. Watershed management is challenging in 
  countries where the people-to-land ratio is high and policy and management are 
  inadequate, prompting use of even the most fragile and unsuitable areas in the 
  watersheds for residential, cultivation, and other intensive uses. This is particularly 
  true for countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, and 
  Vietnam, where many watersheds suffer badly from deforestation, indiscriminate 
  land conversion, excessive soil erosion, declining land productivity, erratic 
  and unreliable surface and groundwater resources, and loss of biodiversity. 
  Many watersheds in Asia already are stressed by intensive use of the land and 
  other resources and by inhospitable climate (especially in arid and semi-arid 
  Asia), beyond their ability to adequately supply water, prevent floods, and 
  deliver other goods and services. In the absence of appropriate adaptation strategies, 
  these watersheds are highly vulnerable to climate change. Global climate change 
  also may have serious water management implications on the territory of boreal 
  Asia. Recent assessments (Izrael et al., 1997a; CAFW, 1998) for all major Siberian 
  rivers (Ob, Yenisei, Lena) with 42% of the total freshwater inflow to the Arctic 
  ocean show that the main water management problems by the year 2050 will be 
  a consequence of significant annual runoff increases (up to 20%) and difficulties 
  with seasonal inundation and flood control measures.</p>
