<h2>16.3. Synthesis</h2>
<h3><a name="1631"></a>16.3.1. Feedbacks and Interactions&#151;Polar Drivers </h3>
<p>Climate change will affect some key polar drivers, creating impacts in the 
  wider global arena. Many of these impacts will be self-amplifying and, once 
  triggered, will affect other regions of the world for centuries to come. These 
  impacts relate to probable changes in the cryosphere, sea level, thermohaline 
  circulation and ocean ventilation, exchange of GHGs, and cloudiness:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Snow/ice-albedo feedback</i>: The amount of absorbed solar radiation, 
    and thus surface heating, depends on surface albedo, which is very high for 
    snow or ice surfaces and much lower in the absence of snow and ice. Thus, 
    absorbed shortwave radiation over the vast areas of snow and ice in polar 
    regions is about three times lower than over non-snow-covered surfaces. Warming 
    will shrink the cryosphere, particularly in the Arctic, causing additional 
    heating of the surface, which in turn will further reduce ice and snow cover. 
    Thus, any significant alteration in albedo over large areas will have the 
    potential to produce a nonlinear, accelerated change. </li>
  <li><i>Sea-level rise</i>: Projected climate change in polar regions will have 
    a critical impact on global sea levels. Expected sea-level rise is in the 
    range 0.09-0.88 m by 2100, using the SRES scenarios (<a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
    WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 11</a>). Increased melting of the Greenland 
    ice sheet and Arctic glaciers, as well as possible thinning of the West Antarctic 
    ice sheet, is expected to make important contributions. However, increased 
    snow accumulation on the East and West Antarctic ice sheets is a major process 
    that can offset sea-level rise. Sea level will continue to rise long after 
    atmospheric GHGs are stabilized, primarily because of the large heat capacity 
    of the ocean and the slow response of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of 
    downwelling of cold, dense waters in polar regions is a major control on thermal 
    expansion of the ocean and hence the rate of sea-level rise over the next 
    centuries. Feedbacks that link sea-level rise to the size and health the West 
    Antarctic ice sheet remain the subject of research and debate and are discussed 
    in more depth in <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 11</a>.</li>
  <li><i>Ocean circulation</i>: Ocean-climate models predict increased stability 
    of the surface mixed layer, reduction in salt flux, less ocean convection, 
    and less deepwater formation. This could lead to a prolonged, major reduction 
    in thermohaline circulation and ocean ventilation (O'Farrell <i>et al</i>., 
    1997; Budd and Wu, 1998; Hirst, 1999). Such changes will affect surface ocean 
    currents and climates of Europe and mid-latitude landmasses in the southern 
    hemisphere, where it could slow warming in some regions (Murphy and Mitchell, 
    1995; Whetton <i>et al</i>., 1996) but amplify it in others. Changes in runoff 
    from large Arctic rivers (especially in Siberia) and increased melt from the 
    Greenland ice sheet and glaciers will to lead to more freshwater in the Arctic 
    Ocean. This may further weaken the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. 
    With less overturning in the ocean, there will be a reduction of upwelling 
    in temperate and subtropical latitudes. Wood <i>et al</i>. (1999) present 
    simulations of present-day thermohaline circulation, using a coupled ocean-atmosphere 
    climate model without flux adjustments. The model responds to forcing with 
    increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs with a collapse of circulation 
    and convection in the Labrador Sea. These changes are similar in two separate 
    simulations with different rates of increase of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Although 
    various models give differing results, any changes in the thermohaline circulation 
    will have profound consequences for marine biology and fisheries because of 
    inevitable changes in habitat and nutrient supply. Perturbations caused by 
    projected climate change, such as a marked increase in freshwater inputs in 
    polar regions, may cause reorganization of the global ocean thermohaline circulation, 
    leading to abrupt climate change (e.g., Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Wright 
    and Stocker, 1993; Stocker and Schmittner, 1997). Palaeoclimatic effects of 
    past large freshwater inputs are widely discussed for the Atlantic (e.g., 
    Broecker <i>et al</i>., 1990; Rasmussen <i>et al</i>., 1996; Bianchi and McCave, 
    1999) and for extra melt from the Antarctic ice sheet (Mikolajewicz, 1998). 
    These studies show that with past climate changes, shifts from one circulation 
    mode to another have caused large, and sometimes abrupt, regional climate 
    changes. Although there is low confidence that such events will occur, the 
    associated impacts would be substantial.</li>
  <li><i>Greenhouse gases&#151;reduced uptake by the Southern Ocean</i>: Projected 
    climate change will alter vast areas of oceans, wetlands, and permafrost in 
    the polar regions that act as major sources and sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and CH<sub>4</sub>. Projected climate change will alter these features, thereby 
    altering the exchange of these gases. Model results (Sarmiento and Le Quere, 
    1996) show that of all oceans, the Southern Ocean is likely to experience 
    the greatest slowing in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake with climate change. Reduced 
    downwelling also will limit the ability of the ocean to sequester anthropogenic 
    CO<sub>2</sub> (Sarmiento <i>et al</i>., 1998). Changing marine biology also 
    must be considered. Using coupled climate model output under the IPCC IS92a 
    GHG scenario, Matear and Hirst (1999) calculate that by the year 2100, there 
    could be a reduction in cumulative oceanic uptake of carbon of 56 Gt. This 
    reduced uptake is equivalent to a 4% yr<sup>-1</sup> increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
    emissions for 1995-2100. </li>
  <li><i>Greenhouse gases&#151;emission by Arctic landscapes</i>: Whether the 
    Arctic will be a net sink or a net source of CO<sub>2</sub> will depend largely 
    on the magnitude and direction of hydrological changes and the rate of decomposition 
    of exposed peat in response to temperature rise (Oechel <i>et al</i>., 1993; 
    McKane <i>et al</i>., 1997a,b). Tundra ecosystems have large stores of nutrients 
    and carbon bound in permafrost, soil, and microbial biomass and have low rates 
    of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake as a result of low net primary production (Callaghan 
    and Jonasson, 1995). The 25-year pattern of net CO<sub>2</sub> flux indicates 
    that tundra in Alaska was a net sink during the cool, wet years of the 1970s; 
    a net source of CO<sub>2</sub> during the warm, dry 1980s; and a net sink 
    during the warm but less dry 1990s (Vourlitis and Oechel, 1999). These responses 
    also may reflect a decrease in the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter 
    because decay potential decreases with depth, as older, more recalcitrant 
    carbon is exposed in soil profiles (Christensen <i>et al</i>., 1998, 1999a,b). 
    Sink activity will be altered by changes in soil water content, temperature, 
    or longer term adjustment of biotic processes (Oechel and Billings, 1992; 
    Shaver <i>et al</i>., 1992; Oechel and Vourlitis, 1994; Chapin <i>et al</i>., 
    1995; Jonasson, 1996; Nadelhoffer <i>et al</i>., 1996; Rastetter <i>et al</i>., 
    1996; Waelbroeck <i>et al</i>., 1997). Increased frequency of disturbances 
    such as fire in boreal forest also could contribute to increased seasonal 
    amplitude of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (Zimov <i>et al</i>., 1999). CH<sub>4</sub> production 
    also is related to the position of the water table in the active layer (Torn 
    and Chapin, 1993; Vourlitis <i>et al</i>., 1993; Johnson <i>et al</i>., 1996). 
    The gas is oxidized in unsaturated soils and in the uppermost layer of the 
    soil water column (Gilmanov and Oechel, 1995; Rouse <i>et al</i>., 1995; Tenhunen, 
    1996). Hence, the future magnitude of soil emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and 
    CO<sub>2</sub> will reflect the net outcome of anaerobic and aerobic processes. 
    Thawing of permafrost has the potential to release considerable quantities 
    of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> (Fukuda, 1994; Michaelson <i>et al</i>., 
    1996; Anisimov <i>et al</i>., 1997; Goulden <i>et al</i>., 1998; Bockheim 
    <i>et al</i>., 1999). Considering all of these effects, future warming is 
    likely to further increase natural GHG emissions. Fluxes of these gases eventually 
    may revert, however, to current levels after an initial pulse (Waelbroeck 
    <i>et al</i>., 1997).</li>
  <li><i>Hydrates of greenhouse gases</i>: Substantial amounts of natural gas 
    may be released to the atmosphere as a result of climate-induced destabilization 
    of gas hydrates beneath the surface of the Earth. On the continents, stable 
    gas hydrates can be found only at depths of several hundreds of meters, making 
    it unlikely that they will be released by climate change in the coming centuries. 
    In the northern seas, gas hydrates may be deposited in the near-bottom zone, 
    and their decomposition is likely to occur if deepwater temperature rises 
    by even a few degrees. Because there are large uncertanties in the estimated 
    amounts of the near-bottom gas hydrates, their role in providing positive 
    feedback to the climate system cannot be evaluated with reasonable accuracy. 
    There is evidence of methane hydrate destabilization and release with warming 
    of coastal ocean bottomwater from other parts of the world (Kennett <i>et 
    al</i>., 2000). </li>
