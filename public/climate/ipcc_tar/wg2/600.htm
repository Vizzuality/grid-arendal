<h2>16.2. Key Regional Concerns</h2>
<p>This chapter follows the agreed TAR template for WGII regional assessments. 
  Rather than assessing all possible impacts of climate change, emphasis is placed 
  on eight key regional concerns. These concerns are chosen for the Arctic and 
  the Antarctic on the basis of earlier findings by the IPCC (Everett and Fitzharris, 
  1998) and on discussions at various workshops of the TAR. They represent what 
  are considered to be the most important impacts of future climate change in 
  the Arctic and Antarctic in the wider global perspective. Although some other 
  impacts (e.g., Arctic glaciers and terrestrial Antarctic biota) may be very 
  important locally, space does not permit a comprehensive review.</p>
<h3><a name="1621"></a>16.2.1. Changes in Ice Sheets and Glaciers </h3>
<p>Changes in the polar climate will have a direct impact on the great ice sheets, 
  ice caps, and glaciers of the polar regions. How each responds will depend on 
  several climatological parameters; some will grow, whereas others shrink. We 
  have high confidence that their overall contribution to rising sea level will 
  be positive, with glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet shrinking. The contribution 
  from Antarctica, however, is uncertain at present. There is a high likelihood 
  that increasing temperatures over the continent and changing storm tracks will 
  cause increased precipitation and thickening of the ice sheet, but there still 
  exists at low confidence the possibility that the West Antarctic ice sheet will 
  retreat dramatically in coming centuries (Vaughan and Spouge, 2000). Such a 
  change would not result from recent and future climate change (Bentley, 1998) 
  but more probably from continuing readjustment to the end of the last glacial 
  period (Bindschadler, 1998), as a result of internal dynamics of the ice sheet 
  (MacAyeal, 1992), or as a result of ice shelf-ocean interaction. This subject 
  and the general issue of sea-level rise are reviewed more comprehensively in 
  <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 11</a>; we include only 
  a summary of the main points here.</p>
<p>The Greenland ice sheet suffers melting in summer at its margin. There is a 
  trend toward an increase in the area and duration of this melt (Abdalati and 
  Steffen, 1997). This trend is likely to continue. Airborne altimetric monitoring 
  has shown that over the period 1993-1998, the Greenland ice sheet was slowly 
  thickening at higher elevations; at lower elevations, thinning (about 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) 
  was underway (Krabill <i>et al</i>., 1999, 2000). If warming continues, the 
  Greenland ice sheet will shrink considerably, as occurred in previous interglacial 
  periods (Cuffey and Marshall, 2000), and if the warming is sustained, the ice 
  sheet will melt completely (see <a href="../wg1/index.htm">TAR WGI</a> <a href="../wg1/408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>).</p>
<p>Over the Antarctic ice sheet, where only a few limited areas show summer melting 
  (Zwally and Fiegles, 1994), a slight thickening is likely as precipitation rates 
  increase (e.g., Ohmura <i>et al</i>., 1996; Smith <i>et al</i>., 1998a; Vaughan 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). In the past decade there has been some change in the ice 
  cover in local areas (e.g., on the Antarctic Peninsula; see <a href="601.htm">Section 
  16.2.2</a>), but the majority of the Antarctic ice sheet appears, from satellite 
  altimetry, to be close to a state of balance (Wingham <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Only the Thwaites and Pine Island glacier basins show any spatially coherent 
  trend, but it is not yet known if their thinning is related to a decrease in 
  precipitation or some dynamic change in the ice sheet. Chinn (1998) reports 
  that recession is the dominant change trend of recent decades for glaciers of 
  the Dry Valleys area of Antarctica. The future of glaciers in the Arctic will 
  be primarily one of shrinkage, although it is possible that in a few cases they 
  will grow as a result of increased precipitation. <br>
</p>
<p> This report is concerned primarily with the impacts of climate change on particular 
  regions. An important question is: How will changes in glacial ice in the polar 
  regions impact local human populations and ecological systems, and what will 
  be the socioeconomic consequences? The short answer is that impacts on ice systems 
  will be substantial, but because the populations of humans and other biota within 
  polar region are low, impacts may be relatively minor. In Antarctica, the continental 
  human population is only a few thousand. A few localities may undergo changes 
  such as that at Stonington Island on the Antarctic Peninsula (Splettoesser, 
  1992), where retreat of the ice sheet has left the station stranded on an island. 
  In general, however, changes to ice sheets will directly cause few significant 
  life-threatening problems.</p>
