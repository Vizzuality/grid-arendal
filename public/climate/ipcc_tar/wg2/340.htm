<h2>8.5. Special Issues in Developing Countries</h2>
<h3><a name="851"></a>8.5.1. Statistics on Disasters</h3>
<p>Although the vast majority of weather-related insurance losses occur in wealthy 
  countries, most of the human suffering occurs in poor countries (<a href="331.htm#fig86">Figure 
  8-6</a>). Whereas 45% of the natural disaster losses between 1985 and 1999 took 
  place in wealthy countries (those with per capita income of more than US$9,360), 
  these countries represent 57% of the US$984 billion in total economic losses 
  and 92% of the US$178 billion in insured losses (Munich Re, 1999b). In contrast, 
  25% of the economic losses and 65% of the 587,000 deaths took place in the poorest 
  countries (those with per capita income below US$760).</p>
<p>Other literature sources, using slightly different definitions and different 
  time periods, conclude that about 90% of deaths from natural disasters from 
  1973 to 1997 occurred in Africa and Asia (IFRC-RCS, 1999a). Figures from the 
  World Disasters Report 1999 (IFRC-RCS, 1999a) indicate that, in the period from 
  1973 to 1997, on average nearly 85,000 persons were killed each year by natural 
  disasters; the number of otherwise affected (impoverished, homeless, injured) 
  was more than 140 million annually. The record of disasters (see <a href="331.htm#fig86">Figure 
  8-6</a>) is a further illustration of the geographic distribution of weather-related 
  disasters.</p>
<p>As indicated in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>, climate change comes with 
  changing frequencies and intensities of extreme weather events. The most vulnerable 
  regions and communities are those that are both highly exposed to hazardous 
  climate change effects and have limited adaptive capacity. Countries with limited 
  economic resources, low levels of technology, poor information and skills, poor 
  infrastructure, unstable or weak institutions, and inequitable empowerment and 
  access to resources have little capacity to adapt and are highly vulnerable 
  (see <a href="641.htm">Chapter 18</a>). The regional chapters in this volume 
  (<a href="377.htm">Chapters 10</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a>) indicate that developing 
  countries, because of their limited or nonexistent financial buffers, are particularly 
  vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Human-induced climate change is 
  expected to result in a further upward trend of disaster losses.</p>
<p>Developing countries&#151;especially those that are reliant on primary production 
  as a major source of income&#151;are particularly vulnerable because these countries 
  and their communities hardly have any financial buffer and there is very little 
  penetration of insurance (see also <a href="331.htm#fig86">Figure 8-6</a>). 
  The conditions facing private insurance markets and government disaster relief 
  differ considerably in developing countries. The penetration of private insurance 
  is extremely low in most cases, although it is growing quickly. The degree of 
  preparedness also is low. The government sector is far less able to operate 
  as a surrogate insurer, even in areas such as crop and flood insurance where 
  governments traditionally are essential in the developed world. In developing 
  countries, the economic and social impacts of catastrophic weather events can 
  pose a material impediment to development. Increased frequency or intensity 
  of such events as a result of climate change could render these markets less 
  attractive than they are at present for private insurers, in turn compounding 
  the adverse impact on development. Thus, developing countries tend to have greater 
  vulnerability and less adaptive capacity than developed countries.</p>
