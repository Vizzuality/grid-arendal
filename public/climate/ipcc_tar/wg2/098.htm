<h3>2.5.4. The Cost of Uncertainty</h3>
<p>This section reviews the primary methods for incorporating uncertainty into 
  analyses of climate impacts. Here we look at how to judge the cost associated 
  with uncertainty. Cost and valuation depend, in general, on the entire distribution 
  of the range of outcomes.</p>
<h4><a name="2541"></a>2.5.4.1. Insurance and the Cost of Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Risk-averse individuals who face uncertainty try to buy insurance to protect 
  themselves from the associated risk (e.g., different incomes next year or over 
  the distant future, depending on the state of nature that actually occurs). 
  How much? Assuming the availability of "actuarially fair" coverage 
  (i.e., coverage available from an insurance provider for which the expected 
  cost of claims over a specified period of time equals the expected income from 
  selling coverage), individuals try to insure themselves fully so that the uncertainty 
  would be eliminated. How? By purchasing an amount of insurance that is equal 
  to the difference between the expected monetary value of all possible outcomes 
  and the certainty-equivalent outcome that insurance would guarantee&#151;the 
  income for which utility equals the <i>expected utility of all possible outcomes.</i> 
</p>
<p>For a risk-averse person, the certainty-equivalent income is less than the 
  expected income, so the difference can be regarded as WTP to avoid risk. In 
  a real sense, therefore, willingly paid insurance premiums represent a measure 
  of the cost of uncertainty. Therefore, they can represent society's WTP 
  for the assurance that nondiversifiable uncertainty would disappear (if that 
  were possible). Thus, this is a precise, utility-based measure of economic cost. 
  The cost of uncertainty would be zero if the objective utility function were 
  risk-neutral; indeed, the WTP to avoid risk is positive only if the marginal 
  utility of economic activity declines as income increases. Moreover, different 
  agents could approach the same uncertain circumstance with different subjective 
  views of the relative likelihoods of each outcome and/or different utility functions. 
  The amount of insurance that they would be willing to purchase would be different 
  in either case. Application of this approach to society therefore must be interpreted 
  as the result of contemplating risk from the perspective of a representative 
  individual. Yohe <i>et al</i>. (2000), for example, apply these structures to 
  and offer interpretations for the distributional international impact of Kyoto-style 
  climate policy.</p>
