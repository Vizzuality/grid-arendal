<h2>15.4. Synthesis </h2>
<p>Our impacts and adaptation assessment indicates that changing climate and changing 
  patterns of regional development have challenged North America and will continue 
  to do so. Damage costs from recent climatic events have increased, and conflicts 
  over climate-sensitive resources (e.g., fish) continue to occur. Future climatic 
  changes may exacerbate these problems and indeed create new ones. Opportunities 
  may arise from a warming climate, and some innovative adaptation mechanisms 
  (e.g., water banks) are being tested to address current problems. However, the 
  literature provides few cases on how adaptive strategies could be implemented 
  in the future as regional climates continue to change. </p>
<p>Recent studies in agriculture point to greater crop diversity and possibilities 
  for adaptation as factors in reducing estimates of future damage. Production 
  forestry is regarded in much the same way, except in high-latitude regions where 
  vulnerabilities to changing climate-related risks (pests, fire, permafrost thaw) 
  still are considered significant challenges for management. Estimates of future 
  damage to U.S. coastal zones have declined despite the recent series of high-cost 
  extreme events. However, studies also have documented changing vulnerabilities 
  of built (urban) environments to atmospheric events, risks to indigenous lifestyles, 
  and the challenge of managing resources within a changing climatic regime to 
  meet multiple objectives. Climate change along the U.S.-Mexican border 
  may result in social and economic problems related to transboundary water resources. 
  Unique natural ecosystems such as prairie wetlands, alpine tundra, and coldwater 
  ecosystems are at risk, and effective mitigation is unlikely.</p>
<p>As impact studies of North America attempt to include adaptation in a more 
  significant way, damage estimates in some sectors decline or become benefits. 
  Mendelsohn and Neumann (1999) illustrate this trend for agriculture, production 
  forestry, and coastal zone impacts in the United States. What also emerges, 
  however, is that high damage costs are still calculated for water-related activities 
  and summer energy demand. Most important, there are several outstanding methodological 
  issues related to the evolution of economic activities, adaptation assumptions, 
  and the value of nonmarket components, resulting in continued difficulties in 
  estimating the cost of impacts and the costs and benefits of adaptation responses. 
  If optimistic views about adaptation were realistic, North America should have 
  been better able to plan for extreme events. Recent experience demonstrates 
  high capability in emergency response, but long-term problems remain. </p>
<p>During recent extreme weather events, synergies between development pressures 
  and environmental changes have resulted in substantial damages. Examples documented 
  in Sections <a href="554.htm#1521">15.2.1</a>, <a href="562.htm#1523">15.2.3</a>, <a href="579.htm#1527">15.2.7</a>, 
  and <a href="583.htm#1532">15.3.2</a> include water-quality problems resulting from 
  North Carolina hurricanes, damage from the 1998 ice storm, reductions in fish 
  stocks as a result of climatic shifts combined with fishing pressure, and various 
  impacts from recent water-level fluctuations in the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, 
  only a few climate change scenario studies explore these kinds of synergies. 
  Besides the challenge of projecting future economies, scenario studies of impacts 
  and adaptation also have to consider the varied demands of regional stakeholders 
  from the same resource and/or location. A summary of adaptation issues for North 
  American subregions is provided in <a href="586.htm#tab156">Table 15-6</a>. 
</p>
<p>A wide range of factors&#151;including changing political and institutional 
  arrangements, technologies, and perceptions&#151;may influence regional development 
  futures. Concerns about development, equity, and sustainability are emerging 
  in international negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
  Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and regional impacts/adaptation concerns 
  can play an important role in this debate (Munasinghe and Swart, 2000). How 
  could development paths alter a region's vulnerability to climate change? Could 
  incentives related to emission reduction also enhance adaptation? Or, could 
  management for certain environmental objectives lead to difficulties in meeting 
  others? The example from the Columbia basin (<a href="583.htm#1532">Section 15.3.2</a>), 
  in which managing for fish protection could lead to increases in GHG emissions 
  (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 2000), illustrates the dilemma that many subregions could 
  face as they consider options for responding to climate change scenarios. How 
  can these interactions be addressed in scenario studies? How can the various 
  economic and social dimensions be accounted for so that there could be more 
  confidence in estimates of impacts damages and adaptation costs/benefits?</p>
<p>Additional information on alternative climate scenarios and regional development 
  futures will be needed in order to improve estimates of the costs of subregional 
  impacts of climate change and the costs and benefits of adaptation responses. 
  As measures associated with the Kyoto Protocol attract more attention from governments 
  and industries, consideration also should be directed at studies on the interplay 
  of mitigation and adaptation at the subregional scale.</p>
