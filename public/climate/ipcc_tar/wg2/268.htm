<h3>5.8.1. State of Wetland Services </h3>
<h4><a name="5811"></a>5.8.1.1. Habitat and Biodiversity</h4>
<p>Global estimates for the area of wetlands vary according to the definition 
  of wetland used. Spiers (1999) reports global estimates for natural freshwater 
  wetlands of 5.7 million km<sup>2</sup>. The estimate by Matthews and Fung (1987) 
  is 5.3 million km<sup>2</sup>, which represents approximately 4% of the Earth's 
  land surface, although a more recent estimate by Lappalainen (1996) is somewhat 
  larger, at 6.4 million km<sup>2</sup>. This compares well with Finlayson and 
  Davidson's (1999) estimate of about 7 million km<sup>2</sup>, including 
  1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> of rice paddy.</p>
<p>Maltby and Proctor (1996) estimate that peatlands cover about 4 million km<sup>2</sup> 
  (&plusmn;4%), constituting about 75% of wetlands. More than 90% of peatlands 
  are in temperate, boreal, and subarctic regions. The total area of tropical 
  peatlands is estimated to be 0.37-0.46 million km<sup>2</sup> (i.e., approximately 
  10 % of the global resource), but the full extent is uncertain (Immirzi et al., 
  1992).</p>
<p>Many wetlands have irregular wetting and drying cycles, driven by climate. 
  To date, little attention has been given to the impact of climate change on 
  these less regular cycles of wetlands in semi-arid and arid regions (Sahagian 
  and Melack, 1998). Changes in the area of these wetlands can be immense but 
  could be monitored by using area-based parameters&#151;for example, functional 
  parameters and wetland extent expressed in terms of ha-days (Sahagian and Melack, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Species that form wetland plant communities are adapted to varying degrees 
  to life in a flooded environment. These phenomena show large spatial variability, 
  and different species show varying degrees of susceptibility to them, so it 
  is not surprising that wetland vegetation exhibits such a high degree of variation 
  in species composition (Crawford, 1983). Peatland plant communities have been 
  observed to change over long periods of time, reflecting the peat accumulation 
  process and leading to gradually drier conditions. This inherent changeability 
  of wetland communities results largely from their occurrence in environments 
  where a single extremely variable habitat factor&#151;water supply&#151;is predominant 
  (Tallis, 1983). Consequently, land use and climate change impacts on these ecosystems 
  can be expected to be mediated through changes in the hydrological regime. </p>
<p>Primary production in wetland communities is highly variable (Bradbury and 
  Grace, 1983; Lugo et al., 1988). Generally, wetland communities&#151;which are 
  dominated by trees, sedges, and grasses&#151;have higher production rates than 
  those characterized by shrubs and mosses. Organic matter produced in many wetlands 
  is accumulated partially (2-16%&#151;P&auml;iv&auml;nen and Vasander, 1994) 
  as peat. A necessary antecedent condition for peat formation and accumulation 
  is an excess of water stored on the mineral soil or sediment surface. This arises 
  in humid climatic regions where precipitation exceeds evaporation (Ivanova, 
  1981; Clymo, 1984) or in more arid climatic regions where lateral inputs of 
  water via surface runoff and/or groundwater seepage are sufficient to exceed 
  evaporative demand (Glaser et al., 1996).</p>
<p>Tropical peatlands play an important role in maintenance of biological diversity 
  by providing a habitat for many tree, mammal, bird, fish, and reptile species 
  (Prentice and Parish, 1992; Rieley and Ahmad-Shah, 1996; Page et al., 1997); 
  some of these species may be endemic or endangered. In common with other peatlands, 
  tropical systems have a significant scientific value that goes beyond their 
  plant and animal communities. </p>
<p>Within the peat also lies a repository of paleoenvironmental and paleogeochemical 
  information that is extremely important in understanding past climatic conditions. 
  These paleorecords are used to estimate rates of peat formation or degradation, 
  former vegetation, climatic conditions, and depositional environments (Morley, 
  1981; Cecil et al., 1993; Moore and Shearer, 1997). </p>
