<h3>1.2.1. Climatic Change Represents Opportunities and Risks for Human Development</h3>
<p>Climate change is likely to present opportunities for some sectors and regions. 
  For example, agriculture could expand into regions where it currently is limited 
  by low temperatures, if adequate soils are present (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>). Thinning of Arctic sea ice might allow surface navigation in areas that 
  previously were accessible only to submarines and icebreakers (see <a href="592.htm">Chapter 
  16</a>). The increase in winter temperature could decrease heating demand or 
  mortality from cold spells (see <a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). However, climate 
  change also is likely to have numerous negative effects on human development 
  and well-being. This is documented in <a href="159.htm">Chapers 4</a>-<a href="619.htm">17</a> 
  and reflected in the first sentence of the UNFCCC, which states that "changes 
  in the Earth's climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind" 
  (United Nations, 1992). The very existence of the UNFCCC demonstrates that the 
  international community exhibits great concern for the risks that climatic change 
  represents for human development and well-being, despite the potential opportunities 
  it offers. Those risks are classified in Article 2 of the UNFCCC, which describes 
  the Convention's ultimate objective (preventing "dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system"). That article mentions the need "to allow ecosystems 
  to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not 
  threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner." 
  Because a key function of the IPCC's assessment reports is to help decisionmakers 
  determine what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate 
  system" (as evidenced by approval at a 1999 IPCC Panel meeting of a series of 
  Policy-Related Questions directed to the <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/index.htm">Synthesis 
  Report</a> authors; IPCC, 1999b), the discussion that follows is framed according 
  to the aforementioned three categories of impacts. </p>
<h4><a name="1211"></a>1.2.1.1. Allow Ecosystems to Adapt Naturally to Climate 
  Change </h4>
<p>The speed and magnitude of climate change affect the success of species, population, 
  and community adaptation. The rate of climatic warming may exceed the rate of 
  shifts in certain species ranges; these species could be seriously affected 
  or even disappear because they are unable to adapt (<a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>). Some plant and animal species (such as endangered species generally 
  and species adapted to narrow niches for which habitat is discontinuous and 
  barriers impede or block migration) and natural systems (such as coral reefs, 
  mangroves, and other coastal wetlands; prairie wetlands; remnant native grasslands; 
  montane ecosystems near ridges and mountaintops; and ecosystems overlying permafrost) 
  could be adversely affected by regional climatic variations that correspond 
  to a less than 1°C mean global warming by 2100. With mean warming of 1-2°C by 
  2100, some regional changes would be significant enough so that adverse impacts 
  to some of these highly sensitive species and systems would become more severe 
  and increase the risk of irreversible damage or loss, and additional species 
  and systems would begin to be adversely impacted. Warming beyond 2°C would further 
  compound the risks (note discussions and citations in <a href="196.htm">Chapters 
  5</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>). </p>
<h4><a name="1212"></a>1.2.1.2. Ensure that Food Production is not Threatened 
</h4>
<p>Human production factors notwithstanding, food production is influenced mostly 
  by the availability of water and nutrients, as well as by temperature. Increases 
  in temperature could open new areas to cultivation, but they also could increase 
  the risk of heat or drought stress in other areas. Livestock (e.g., cattle, 
  swine, and poultry) are all susceptible to heat stress and drought (Gates, 1993). 
  The effects of climatic changes-even smooth trends-will not be uniform in space 
  or time. For smoothly evolving climatic scenarios, recent literature (see <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>) tends to project that high latitudes may experience increases in productivity 
  for global warming up to a 1°C increase, depending on crop type, growing season, 
  changes in temperature regimes, and seasonality of precipitation. In the tropics 
  and subtropics-where some crops already are near their maximum temperature tolerance 
  and where dryland, nonirrigated agriculture predominates-the literature suggests 
  that yields will tend to decrease with even nominal amounts of climate change 
  (IPCC, 1998; <a href="196.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Moreover, the adaptive capacity 
  of less-developed countries in the tropics is limited by financial and technological 
  constraints that are not equally applicable to more temperate, developed countries. 
  This would increase the disparity in food production between developed and developing 
  countries. For global warming greater than 2.5°C, <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a> reports that most studies agree that world food prices-a key indicator 
  of overall agricultural vulnerability-would increase. Much of the literature 
  suggests that productivity increases in middle to high latitudes will diminish, 
  and yield decreases in the tropics and subtropics are expected to be more severe 
  (<a href="196.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="657.htm">19</a>). These projections 
  are likely to be underestimates, and our confidence in them cannot be high because 
  they are based on scenarios in which significant changes in extreme events such 
  as droughts and floods are not fully considered or for which rapid nonlinear 
  climatic changes have not been assumed (<a href="083.htm">Section 2.3.4</a> 
  notes that vulnerability to extreme events generally is higher than vulnerability 
  to changing mean conditions). </p>
<p> Water availability can be regarded as another component of food security. 
  Water quantity and distribution depends to a large extent on rainfall and evaporation, 
  which are both affected in a changing climate. Typically, estimated patterns 
  of changes for 2100 under SRES scenarios include rainfall increases in high 
  latitudes and some equatorial regions and decreases in many mid-latitude, subtropical, 
  and semi-arid regions-which would increase water stress (the ratio between water 
  usage and renewable flow) in the latter regions and decrease it in the former. 
  As noted in <a href="159.htm">Chapter 4</a>, negative trends in water availability 
  have the potential to induce conflict between different users (e.g., Kennedy 
  et al., 1998). For perspective, it should be remembered that the capability 
  of current water supply systems and their ability to respond to changes in water 
  demand determine to a large extent the severity of possible climate change impacts 
  on water supply. Currently, 1.3 billion people do not have access to adequate 
  supplies of safe water, and 2 billion people do not have access to adequate 
  sanitation (Gleick, 1998; UNDP, 1999). In addition to changes in average water 
  supply, climate extremes such as droughts and floods often are projected to 
  become a larger problem in many temperate and humid regions (IPCC, 1998; <a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table 
  SPM-1</a>, <a href="005.htm">WGII TAR Summary for Policymakers</a>). 
</p>
<h4> <a name="1213"></a>1.2.1.3. Enable Economic Development to Proceed in a Sustainable 
  Manner</h4>
<p>Sustainable development, as noted earlier, implies "meeting the needs of the 
  present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
  own needs" (WCED, 1987). Besides food and water, essential needs include a space 
  to live, good health, respite from extreme events, peace and basic freedom, 
  energy and natural resources that allow development, and so forth. Each of these 
  factors could be affected by climatic change. For example, if there were no 
  significant adaptive responses, a 1-m sea-level rise would decrease the area 
  of Bangladesh by 17.5% or that of the Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands by 
  80%. Human health impacts of global climatic change include changes in the geographic 
  range and seasonality of various infectious diseases (with positive and negative 
  impacts), increases in mortality and morbidity associated with heat waves, and 
  effects on malnutrition and starvation in some regions as a result of redistribution 
  of food and water resources (<a href="347.htm">Chapter 9</a>). The possibility 
  of improved conditions in other regions remains, but, as noted in <a href="196.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>, the literature tends to project that positive effects in agriculture 
  would be concentrated in high latitudes and negative effects in lower latitudes-precisely 
  where problems of hunger already exist. The frequency and severity of extreme 
  events such as heat waves, high rainfall intensity events, summer droughts, 
  tropical cyclones, windstorms, storm surges, and possibly El Niño-like conditions 
  are likely to increase in a warmer world (<a href="009.htm#tabspm1">Table SPM-1</a>, 
  <a href="005.htm">WGII TAR Summary for Policymakers</a>), 
  which would have a range of adverse impacts and would affect the conditions 
  of development. Migration of populations affected by extreme events or average 
  changes in the distribution of resources might increase the risks of political 
  instabilities and conflicts (e.g., Myers, 1993; Kennedy et al., 1998; Rahman, 
  1999). For each of these potential impacts, the relative vulnerability of different 
  regions to adverse impacts of climatic change is largely determined by their 
  access to resources, information, and technology and by the stability and effectiveness 
  of their institutions. This means that possibilities to promote sustainable 
  development will be affected more negatively by climatic change in developing 
  countries and among less-privileged populations. Thus, climatic change could 
  make satisfying the essential needs of these populations more difficult, in 
  the short term and in the long term. In that sense, climatic change is likely 
  to increase world and country-scale inequity, within the present generation 
  and between present and future generations, particularly in developing countries. 
  Given this potential vulnerability, steps to strengthen adaptive and mitigative 
  (see <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WGIII</a> <a href="../wg3/048.htm">Chapter 1</a>) capacity 
  and to lessen nonclimatic stressors could well enhance sustainable development.
