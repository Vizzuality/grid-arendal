<h4><a name="15232"></a>15.2.3.2. Production Forestry </h4>
<p>Evaluation of effects of climate change on production forestry are constrained 
  by uncertainties discussed in <a href="558.htm#15221">Section 15.2.2.1</a> (i.e., 
  state-of-the-art forest models and GCM predictions produce equal probabilities 
  of "considerable forest dieback" and "enhanced forest growth"). Moreover, in 
  many cases, site-specific conditions as well as history, human management, air 
  pollution, and biotic effects (e.g., herbivory) are much stronger controllers 
  of forest productivity than climate change or CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (Eamus 
  and Jarvis, 1989; Aber and Driscoll, 1997; Ollinger <i>et al</i>., 1997; Goodale 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998), especially in mid-latitudes. Finally, lands managed for 
  timber production are likely to be less susceptible to climate change than unmanaged 
  forests because of the potential for adaptive management (Binkley and Van Kooten, 
  1994). </p>
<p>In a broader assessment for the United States, Sohngen and Mendelsohn (1999) 
  used several GCMs, a variety of ecological models, and a dynamic economic model 
  (with adaptation) to assess climate change impacts on the U.S. timber market. 
  Under a broad range of climate and ecosystem model predictions, economic changes 
  were positive, as a result of generally positive impacts of climate change on 
  U.S. forest production and the ability of producers to adapt. Disturbances from 
  insects and fire were assumed to increase, but the study also assumed that there 
  would be salvage logging followed by planting of the right species for a new 
  climatic regime. In a sensitivity analysis, in which the possibility of replanting 
  with incorrect species was considered, economic impacts became negative as a 
  result of reductions in available stocks and increased regeneration costs.<br>
</p>
<p>The foregoing uncertainty raises questions about evaluating impacts and developing 
  adaptation strategies. For example, Woodbury <i>et al</i>. (1998) used a climate change 
  scenario derived from four GCMs, results from experimental studies, and a probabilistic 
  regional modeling approach and estimate that there is a high likelihood that 
  loblolly pine (a major timber production species) growth is likely to decrease 
  slightly over a 12-state region of the southern United States. However, they 
  also estimate that there is a substantial chance of either a large decrease 
  or a large increase in growth. How can this information be used by the timber 
  industry? Should managers assume that there would be no problems with loblolly 
  pine plantations? Should they increase the area of these plantations? Should 
  they convert plantations to a more mixed plantation community? Should plantations 
  be converted to "natural succession"? Crippling uncertainty of this 
  type may lead this production industry (as well as others) to disregard climate 
  change as a factor in planning.<br>
</p>
<p>Similar questions have been raised in northwest Canada (see <a href="587.htm">Section 
  15.3.2.8</a>). Within the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study (MBIS), debate about 
  forest management concerned the scenario of reduced spruce yield and increased 
  risk of losses from fire and insect damage (Hartley and Marshall, 1997; Rothman 
  and Herbert, 1997). In the short term, a large number of pressing issues divert 
  attention from long-term climate change (e.g., land-use planning, British Columbia's 
  Forest Practices Code, treaty negotiations with aboriginal people, trade with 
  the United States, protected area strategy). Adaptation to climate change requires 
  information that is relevant to the context of the industry, particularly if 
  there are implications for harvesting (Barrett, 1997; Fletcher, 1997).</p>
