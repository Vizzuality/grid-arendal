<h2>12.6. Settlements and Industry </h2>
<a name="1261"></a>
<h3>12.6.1 Infrastructure </h3>
<p>Climate change will affect settlements and industry through changes in mean 
  climate and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events. Obviously, 
  changes in average climate affect design and performance, including variables 
  such as heating and cooling demand, drainage, structural standards, and so forth. 
  However, in many cases average climate is only a proxy for design standards 
  that are developed to cope with extreme demands or stresses such as flooding 
  rains, gale-force wind gusts, heat waves, and cold spells.</p>
<p>If the severity, frequency, or geographic spread of extreme events changes, 
  the impact of such changes on infrastructure may be severe. For instance, movement 
  of tropical cyclones further south into areas where infrastructure is not designed 
  to cope with them would have significant consequences.</p>
<p>The rate and nature of degradation of infrastructure is directly related to 
  climatic factors. Computer models to predict degradation as a function of location, 
  materials, and design and construction factors have been developed (Cole <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999a,b,c,d). Because buildings and infrastructure that are being constructed 
  now will have projected lives until 2050, placement, design, and construction 
  changes to guarantee this life against climate change are needed. Moreover, 
  the effects of degradation and severe meteorological events may have an unfortunate 
  synergy. Increase in the rate of degradation as a result of climate change may 
  promote additional failures when a severe event occurs. If the intensity or 
  geographical spread of severe events changes, this effect may be compounded.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, a Climate Change Sustainability Index (CCSI) developed by Robinson 
  (1999) rates the impact of climate change on a house and the contribution to 
  climate change of GHG emissions from the house. The index includes GHG emissions 
  from heating and cooling, comfort, tropical cyclone risk, and coastal and inland 
  flooding. Basically, the closer the house is to sea level and/or a river or 
  waterway, the lower the CCSI. Higher temperatures and rainfalls in general will 
  shorten the life span of many buildings.</p>
<p>The impact of extreme climatic events already is very costly in both countries. 
  This has been documented for Australia in Pittock <i>et al.</i> (1999), where it is 
  shown that major causes of damage are hail, floods, tropical cyclones, and wildfire. 
  In New Zealand, floods and landslides are the most costly climatically induced 
  events, with strong winds and hail also important. The International Federation 
  of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (1999) report estimates damages from 
  a combination of drought, flood, and high wind (including cyclones, storms, 
  and tornadoes) in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands) 
  to be about US$870 million yr<sup>-1</sup> over the years 1988-1997. This figure apparently 
  does not include hail damage, which is a major cost. Insured losses from a single 
  severe hailstorm that struck Sydney in April 1999 were estimated at about AU$1.5 
  billion (roughly US$1 billion) (NHRC, 1999).</p>
<p>A scoping study for Queensland Transport (Queensland Transport <i>et al.</i>, 1999) 
  has identified vulnerabilities for the Queensland transport infrastructure that 
  will require adaptation. Infrastructure considered include coastal highways 
  and railways, port installations and operations (as a result of high winds, 
  sea-level rise, and storm surges), inland railways and roads (washouts and high 
  temperatures), and some airports in low-lying areas. Key climate variables considered 
  were extreme rainfall, winds, temperatures, storm surge, flood frequency and 
  severity, sea waves, and sea level. Three weather systems combining extremes 
  of several of these variables&#151;tropical cyclones, east coast lows, and tropical 
  depressions&#151;also were assessed.</p>
<p>Regional projections for each of these variables were created, with levels 
  of confidence, for four regions of Queensland for 2030, 2070, and 2100. Overall, 
  the potential effects of climate change were assessed as noticeable by 2030 
  and likely to pose significant risks to transport infrastructure by 2070, if 
  no adaptation were undertaken. Setting new standards, in the form of new design 
  criteria and carrying out specific assessments in prioritized areas where infrastructure 
  is vulnerable, was recommended for roads and rail under threat of flooding, 
  bridges, and ports. Detailed risk assessments for airports in low-lying coastal 
  locations were recommended.</p>

<p>Many ports and coastal communities already suffer from occasional storm-surge 
  flooding and wave damage. A series of studies identifies particular vulnerabilities 
  in some Queensland coastal cities (Smith and Greenaway, 1994; AGSO, 1999). Inland 
  and coastal communities also are vulnerable to riverine flooding (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 
  1997; Smith, 1998a). A key feature of these studies is the nonlinear nature 
  of damage response curves to increased magnitude and frequency of extreme events. 
  This is partly because of exceedance of present design standards and the generally 
  nonlinear nature of the damage/stress relationship, with the onset of building 
  collapse and chain events from flying or floating debris (Smith, 1998a).</p>
<p>A study by McInnes <i>et al.</i> (2000; see also Walsh <i>et al.</i>, 2000) estimates the 
  height of storm tides at the city of Cairns, in northern Queensland, for the 
  present climate and for an enhanced greenhouse climate in which&#151;based on 
  the findings of Walsh and Ryan (2000)&#151;the central pressure of tropical 
  cyclones was lowered by about 10 hPa and the standard deviation of central pressure 
  (a measure of variability) was increased by 5 hPa but the numbers were unchanged. 
  Cairns is a low-lying city and tourist center, with a population of about 100,000 
  that is growing at about 3% yr<sup>-1</sup>. Under present conditions, McInnes <i>et al.</i> (2000) 
  found that the 1-in-100-year event is about 2.3 m in height; under the enhanced 
  greenhouse conditions, it would increase to about 2.6 m, and with an additional 
  10- to 40-cm sea-level rise, the 1-in-100-year event would be about 2.7-3.0 
  m (see <a href="#fig12-4">Figure 12-4</a>). This would imply greatly increased inundation and wave 
  damage in such an event, suggesting a possible need for changes in zoning, building 
  regulations, and evacuation procedures.</p>
<p>Urban areas also are vulnerable to riverine flooding (Smith, 1998a) and flash 
  floods exacerbated by fast runoff from paved and roofed areas (Abbs and Trinidad, 
  1996). Considerable effort has gone into methods to improve estimates of extreme 
  precipitation under present conditions (Abbs and Ryan, 1997; Abbs, 1998). Schreider 
  <i>et al.</i> (2000) applied a rainfall-runoff model to three different catchments 
  upstream of Sydney and Canberra under doubled-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. They found increases 
  in the magnitude and frequency of flood events, but these effects differed widely 
  between catchments because of the different physical characteristics of each 
  catchment.</p>
<p>The safety of publicly owned and private dams also is a major issue (ANCOLD, 
  1986; Webster and Wark, 1987; Pisaniello and McKay, 1998) that is likely to 
  be exacerbated by increases in rainfall intensity and probable maximum precipitation 
  (Pearce and Kennedy, 1993; Fowler and Hennessy, 1995; Abbs and Ryan, 1997; Hennessy 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997).</p>
  Vulnerability depends not only on the severity of the potential impacts but 
on hazard mitigation measures put in place (including time- and location-specific 
hazard prediction), crisis management capability, and policies that avoid or minimize 
the hazard. These matters are discussed in Smith (1998a), Handmer (1997), and 
Kouzmin and Korac-Kakabadse (1999).<br clear="all">
