<h4>5.6.4.2. Vulnerability Associated with NPP, NEP, and NBP </h4>
<p>Given their inertia, forested systems may exhibit low vulnerability and low 
  climate sensitivity, unless drought and disturbance are driving factors (Peterken 
  and Mountford, 1996). Extant forests may persist and appear to exhibit low vulnerability 
  and low climate sensitivity (see <a href="202.htm">Section 5.2</a>), but they 
  may be climate sensitive in ways that are not immediately apparent. Thus, their 
  vulnerability may occur as a reduction in quality (degradation) even where the 
  forest persists as an entity. Increases in disturbances, however, may lead to 
  rapid structural changes of forests, with replacement by weedy species (Overpeck 
  et al., 1990). For example, an increase in area burned by fire or destroyed 
  by invading insects and disease could rapidly undergo changes in species composition, 
  successional dynamics, rates of nutrient cycling, and many other aspects of 
  forest ecosystems&#151;with impacts on goods and services provided by these 
  forests. From this perspective, in the context of all of the direct and indirect 
  impacts of climatic change and their interactions, the potential vulnerability 
  of forests is high.</p>
<p>The main processes that determine the carbon balance of forests&#151;photosynthesis, 
  plant and heterotrophic respiration, and disturbance releases&#151;are regulated 
  by different environmental factors. Carbon assimilation is a function mainly 
  of available light, temperature, nutrients, and CO<sub>2</sub>, and this function shows 
  a saturation characteristic. Respiration is a function of temperature; it increases 
  exponentially with temperature. Thus, close correlation between GPP and NPP 
  does not exist (allocation plays an important role). Similarly, there is no 
  strict correlation between NPP and NEP (high NEP is possible at high and low 
  rates of assimilation and respiration). Disturbances such as harvest or fire 
  export carbon from forests, bypassing respiration; thus, NBP is not expected 
  to correlate with NEP and NPP. Photosynthesis, plant and heterotrophic respiration, 
  and disturbance are vulnerable in different ways and are quite sensitive to 
  climate change and other global change forces.</p>
<h4><a name="5643"></a>5.6.4.3. Vulnerability of Unmanaged Systems</h4>
<p>Increases in disturbances such as insect infestations and fires can lead to 
  rapid structural and functional changes in forests (species composition, successional 
  dynamics, rates of nutrient cycles, etc.), with replacement by weedy species. 
  The effects of these vulnerabilities in unmanaged systems on goods and services 
  vary. They are not likely to have large effects on market products given that 
  unmanaged forests constitute an increasingly small portion of timber harvests. 
  They could have large impacts on local provision of timber products, NWFP, and 
  fuelwood. Local services from forests could be highly vulnerable, particularly 
  if the services are tied to specific forest functions that change (e.g., hiking 
  in old-growth forests). </p>
<h4><a name="5644"></a>5.6.4.4. Vulnerability in Managed Systems</h4>
<p>Managed systems are vulnerable to direct impacts on NPP (related to volume 
  production) and species composition (related to timber quality), as well as 
  market forces. The global supply of market products exhibits low vulnerability 
  because timber markets have high capacity to adapt to change. Temperate and 
  boreal producers are vulnerable to dieback effects and lower prices caused by 
  potential global increases in timber growth. Managed forests in subtropical 
  regions have low vulnerability given their high growth rates and short rotation 
  periods, which provide multiple opportunities to adapt to changes.</p>
