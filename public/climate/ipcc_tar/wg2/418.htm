<h4>11.1.2.2.2. Precipitation </h4>
<p>Rainfall in boreal Asia is highly variable on seasonal and interannual as well 
  as spatial scales. The time series of annual mean precipitation in Russia suggests 
  a decreasing trend; these tendencies have amplified during 1951-1995, especially 
  in warm years (Rankova, 1998). In long-term mean precipitation, a decreasing 
  trend of about -4.1 mm/month/100 years has been reported in boreal Asia. During 
  the past 10-15 years, however, precipitation has increased, mostly during 
  the summer-autumn period (Izrael et al., 1997b). As a result of this increase 
  in precipitation, water storage in a 1-m soil layer has grown by 10-30 
  mm (Robock et al., 2000). The large upward trends in soil moisture (of more 
  than 1 cm/10 years) have created favorable conditions for infiltration into 
  groundwater. The levels of major aquifers have risen by 50-100 cm; the 
  growth of groundwater storage has resulted in increasing ground river recharge 
  and considerable low-water runoff. </p>
<p>Annual mean rainfall is considerably low in most parts of the arid and semi-arid 
  region of Asia. Moreover, temporal variability is quite high: Occasionally, 
  as much as 90% of the annual total is recorded in just 2 months of the year 
  at a few places in the region. Rainfall observations during the past 50 years 
  in some countries in the northern parts of this region have shown an increasing 
  trend on annual mean basis. A decreasing trend in annual precipitation for the 
  period 1894-1997 has been observed in Kazakhstan. The precipitation in 
  spring, summer, and autumn, however, has shown slight increasing trends. In 
  Pakistan, seven of 10 stations have shown a tendency toward increasing rainfall 
  during monsoon season (Chaudhari, 1994).</p>
<p>In temperate Asia, the East Asian monsoon greatly influences temporal and spatial 
  variations in rainfall. Annual mean rainfall in Mongolia is 100-400 mm 
  and is confined mainly to summer. Summer rainfall seems to have declined over 
  the period 1970-1990 in Gobi; the number of days with relatively heavy 
  rainfall events has dropped significantly (Rankova, 1998). In China, annual 
  precipitation has been decreasing continuously since 1965; this decrease has 
  become serious since the 1980s (Chen et al., 1992). The summer monsoon is reported 
  to be stronger in northern China during globally warmer years (Ren et al., 2000). 
  On the other hand, drier conditions have prevailed over most of the monsoon-affected 
  area during globally colder years (Yu and Neil, 1991).</p>
<p>In tropical Asia, hills and mountain ranges cause striking spatial variations 
  in rainfall. Approximately 70% of the total annual rainfall over the Indian 
  subcontinent is confined to the southwest monsoon season (June-September). The 
  western Himalayas get more snowfall than the eastern Himalayas during winter. 
  There is more rainfall in the eastern Himalayas and Nepal than in the western 
  Himalayas during the monsoon season (Kripalani et al., 1996). The annual mean 
  rainfall in Sri Lanka is practically trendless; positive trends in February 
  and negative trends in June have been reported, however (Chandrapala and Fernando, 
  1995). In India, long-term time series of summer monsoon rainfall have no discernible 
  trends, but decadal departures are found above and below the long time averages 
  alternatively for 3 consecutive decades (Kothyari and Singh, 1996). Recent decades 
  have exhibited an increase in extreme rainfall events over northwest India during 
  the summer monsoon (Singh and Sontakke, 2001). Moreover, the number of rainy 
  days during the monsoon along east coastal stations has declined in the past 
  decade. A long-term decreasing trend in rainfall in Thailand is reported (OEPP, 
  1996). In Bangladesh, decadal departures were below long-term averages until 
  1960; thereafter they have been much above normal (Mirza and Dixit, 1997).</p>
