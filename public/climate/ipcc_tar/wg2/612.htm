<h3><a name="1628"></a>16.2.8. Impact on Human Communities in the Arctic</h3>
<h4><a name="16281"></a>16.2.8.1. Impacts on Indigenous Peoples </h4>
<p>Historically, most indigenous groups have shown resilience and ability to survive 
  changes in resource availability (e.g., the transition from Dorset to Thule 
  cultures), but they may be less well equipped to cope with the combined impacts 
  of climate change and globalization (Peterson and Johnson, 1995). Indigenous 
  peoples, who number 1.5 million of a total Arctic population of 10 million, 
  have a mixture of formal economies (e.g., commercial harvesting of fish, oil 
  and mineral extraction, forestry, and tourism) and informal economies (e.g., 
  harvesting of natural renewable resources). Increasingly, the overall economy 
  is tied to distant markets. For example, in Alaska, gross income from tourism 
  is US$1.4 billion, and in Russia 92% of exported oil is extracted from wells 
  north of the Arctic Circle (Nuttall, 1998). The distinction between formal and 
  informal economies becomes blurred by transfer payments and income derived from 
  commercial ventures. The value of native harvests of renewable resources has 
  been estimated to be 33-57% of the total economy of some northern communities 
  (Quigley and McBridge, 1987; Brody, 1991). However, harvesting of renewable 
  resources also must be considered in terms of maintaining cultural activities 
  (Duerden, 1992). Harvesting contributes to community cohesion and self-esteem, 
  and knowledge of wildlife and the environment strengthens social relationships 
  (Warren <i>et al</i>., 1995; Berkes, 1998). For example, hunting of wildlife 
  is an essential part of Inuit tradition (Wenzel, 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>Climate change and economic development associated with oil extraction, mining, 
  and fish farming will result in changes in diet and nutritional health and exposure 
  to air-, water-, and food-borne contaminants in northern people (Bernes, 1996; 
  Rees and Williams, 1997; Vilchek and Tishkov, 1997; AMAP, 1998; Weller and Lange, 
  1999; Freese, 2000). People who rely on marine systems for food resources are 
  particularly at risk because Arctic marine food chains are long (Welch, 1995; 
  AMAP, 1997). Low-lying Arctic coasts of western Canada, Alaska, and the Russian 
  Far East are particularly sensitive to sea-level rise. Coastal erosion and retreat 
  as a result of thawing of ice-rich permafrost already are threatening communities, 
  heritage sites, and oil and gas facilities (Forbes and Taylor, 1994; Dallimore 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Cohen, 1997a,b; Shaw <i>et al</i>., 1998; Wolfe <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Are, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>Along the Bering and Chukchi Sea coasts, indigenous peoples report thinning 
  and retreating sea ice, drying tundra, increased storms, reduced summer rainfall, 
  warmer winters, and changes in the distribution, migration patterns, and numbers 
  of some wildlife species. These peoples testify that they already are feeling 
  some of the impacts of a changing, warming climate (Mulvaney, 1998). For example, 
  when sea ice is late in forming, certain forms of hunting are delayed or may 
  not take place at all. When sea ice in the spring melts or deteriorates too 
  rapidly, it greatly decreases the length of the hunting season. Many traditional 
  foods are dried (e.g., walrus, whale, seal, fish, and birds) in the spring and 
  summer to preserve them for consumption over the long winter months. When the 
  air is too damp and wet during the "drying" seasons, food becomes 
  moldy and sour. The length of the wet season also affects the ability to gather 
  greens such as willow leaves, beach greens, dock, and wild celery. These testimonies 
  reflect the kinds of changes that could be expected as global warming affects 
  the Arctic (Mulvaney, 1998). As climate continues to change, there will be significant 
  impacts on the availability of key subsistence marine and terrestrial species. 
  At a minimum, salmon, herring, walrus, seals, whales, caribou, moose, and various 
  species of waterfowl are likely to undergo shifts in range and abundance. This 
  will entail local adjustments in harvest strategies as well as in allocations 
  of labor and resources (e.g., boats, snowmobiles, weapons). As the climate changes, 
  community involvement in decisionmaking has the potential to promote sustainable 
  harvesting of renewable resources, thereby avoiding deterioration of common 
  property. However, factors that are beyond the control of the local community 
  may frustrate this ideal. For example, many migratory animals are beyond the 
  hunters' geographical range for much of the year&#151;and thus beyond the 
  management of small, isolated communities. Traditional subsistence activities 
  are being progressively marginalized by increasing populations and by transnational 
  commercial activities (Sklair, 1991; Nuttall, 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>In the past, when population densities of indigenous people were lower and 
  economic and social structures were linked only weakly to those in the south, 
  northern peoples showed significant flexibility in coping with climate variability 
  (Sabo, 1991; Odner, 1992). Now, commercial, local, and conservation interests 
  have reduced their options. Predicted climate change is likely to have impacts 
  on marine and terrestrial animal populations; changes in population size, structure, 
  and migration routes also are probable (Beamish, 1995; Gunn, 1995; Ono, 1995). 
  Careful management of these resources will be required within a properly consultative 
  framework, similar to recent agreements that are wide-ranging and endeavor to 
  underpin the culture and economy of indigenous peoples (Nuttall, 1998). Langdon 
  (1995) claims that "the combination of alternative cultural lifestyles 
  and altered subsistence opportunities resulting from a warmer climate may pose 
  the greatest threat of all to the continuity of indigenous cultures in northern 
  North America." An alternative view is that northern people live with uncertainty 
  and learn to cope with it; this view suggests that "for indigenous people, 
  climate change is often not a top priority, but a luxury, and Western scientists 
  may well be indoctrinating Natives with their own terminology and agenda on 
  climate change" (BESIS, 1999).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="16282"></a>16.2.8.2. Impacts on Economic Activity </h4>
<p>The following subsections summarize the impacts of climate change and adaptive 
  responses for different economic sectors that are relevant to the Arctic. Within 
  different regions of the Arctic, important economic sectors differ substantially; 
  some sectors are underrepresented, and others are just developing in certain 
  regions (e.g., tourism). This latter topic (like agriculture and forestry) receives 
  little or no comment in this section because there is insufficient literature 
  to address the effects of climate change from a polar perspective.</p>
