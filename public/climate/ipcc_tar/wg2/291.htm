<h3>6.3.7. Marine Mammals and Seabirds </h3>
<p>Marine mammals and seabirds are sensitive indicators of changes in ocean environments. 
  Springer (1998) concluded that synchrony in extreme fluctuations of abundance 
  of marine birds and mammals across the North Pacific and Western Arctic were 
  a response to physical changes, including climate warming. The linkages with 
  climate change were compelling enough for Springer to suggest that fluctuations 
  in marine bird and mammal populations in the North Pacific are entirely related 
  to climate variations and change.</p>
<p>The climate variations beginning in the 1990s and associated with El Ni&ntilde;o 
  conditions (Trenberth and Hoar, 1996), in combination with overfishing, have 
  been linked to behavioral changes in killer whales. These changes drastically 
  reduced sea otter abundance along the Aleutian Islands, which in turn changed 
  the ecology of the kelp forests (Estes <i>et al.</i>, 1998). The changes in 
  prey resulting from persistent changes in climate appear to be one of the important 
  impacts of a changing climate on the marine mammals that feed from the top of 
  the food chain. </p>
<p>Climate change also may have an effect on access to prey among marine mammals. 
  For instance, extended ice-free seasons in the Arctic could prolong the fasting 
  of polar bears (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>), with possible implications for the 
  seal population (Stirling <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Reduced ice cover and access 
  to seals would limit hunting success by polar bears and foxes, with resulting 
  reductions in bear and fox populations. This dynamic could have negative effects 
  on the lifestyle, food, and health standards of some indigenous peoples (Hansell 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Because global climate change is likely to have profound 
  impacts on sea-ice extent and duration, it is in this habitat where the initial 
  impacts on marine mammals may be first evident. Reductions in sea ice have been 
  predicted to alter the seasonal distributions, geographic ranges, migration 
  patterns, nutritional status, reproductive success, and ultimately the abundance 
  of Arctic marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster, 1997). Studies recognizing multi-year 
  to decadal variability in marine biotic systems include Mullin (1998) on zooplankton 
  over 5 decades in the eastern Pacific (with connections to El Ni&ntilde;o), 
  and Tunberg and Nelson (1998) on soft bottom macrobenthic communities in the 
  northeast Atlantic (with connections to the North Atlantic Oscillation). Sagarin 
  <i>et al.</i> (1999) have argued that changes in the distribution of intertidal 
  macroinvertebrates on rocky shores in California over the past 60 years have 
  been caused by climate change.</p>
<p>Seabirds are an integral part of marine ecosystems, where they may consume 
  vast amounts of fish. It has been estimated that seabirds consume 600,000 t 
  yr<sup>-1</sup> of food in the North Atlantic (Hunt and Furness, 1996). Modeling 
  studies have shown that in several marine ecosystems, seabirds eat 20-30% 
  of the annual pelagic fish production. The dependence on some species of fish, 
  particularly during breeding, and their large abundance make seabirds a good 
  indicator of ecosystem change. Where changes in breeding success or mortality 
  occur, however, distinguishing the climate impact from fishing impacts can be 
  difficult (Duffy and Schneider, 1994). Very few decadal-scale studies of seabirds 
  are available to assess the impacts of long-term variations in climate, however.</p>
<p>In general, seabirds have evolved to adapt to weather patterns (Butler <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1997). The ability of a species to alter its migration strategy appears 
  to be important to survival in a changing climate. Food resources appear to 
  be critical to general survival, especially for young seabirds. Dolman and Sutherland 
  (1994) proposed that feeding rate affects the ability of individuals to survive 
  winter. The change in marine ecosystem described by Roemmich and McGowan (1995) 
  was associated with a mortality resulting in a 40% decline in seabird abundance 
  within the California current system from 1987 to 1994 (Veit <i>et al.</i>, 
  1996). The decline was largely related to a dramatic (90%) decline of sooty 
  shearwaters (<i>Puffinus girseus</i>), but the response in the ecosystem was 
  not characterized only by declines. There was a northward movement of some species, 
  and in offshore waters the abundance of the most common species, Leach's 
  storm petrels (<i>Oceanodroma leucorhoa</i>), increased over the same period. 
  The authors were careful to note that the changes in abundance they described 
  could not be related directly to population dynamics because of complex migratory 
  patterns and the size of the habitat.</p>
<p>Such changes are evidence of the sensitivity of seabirds to climate-ocean changes 
  and that survival and distribution impacts will occur as climates shift. The 
  anomalous cold surface waters that occurred in the northwest Atlantic in the 
  early 1990s changed the fish species composition in the surface waters on the 
  Newfoundland shelf. These changes were readily detected in the diets of northern 
  gannet (<i>Sula bassana</i>). The sensitivity of the distribution patterns of 
  the pelagic prey of fish-feeding and plankton-feeding seabirds imply to Montevecchi 
  and Myers (1997) that small changes in the ocean environment resulting from 
  climate changes could affect seabird reproductive success. Changes in fish-feeding 
  seabird abundance in the eastern Bering Sea are related to the abundance of 
  juvenile pollock (Springer, 1992). It has been argued that long lifespans and 
  genetic variation within populations enable seabirds to survive adverse short-term 
  environmental events, as evidenced by the response to El Ni&ntilde;o and La 
  Ni&ntilde;a events in the tropical Pacific (Ribic <i>et al.</i>, 1997). However, 
  small populations tied to restricted habitat, such as the Galapagos Penguin 
  (<i>Spheniscus mendiculus</i>), may be threatened by long-term climate warming 
  (Boersma, 1998).</p>

<h3>6.3.8. Diseases and Toxicity</h3>
<p>Changes in precipitation, pH, water temperature, wind, dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  and salinity can affect water quality in estuarine and marine waters. Some marine 
  disease organisms and algal species are strongly influenced by one or more of 
  these factors (Anderson <i>et al.</i>, 1998). In the past few decades there 
  has been an increase in reports of diseases affecting closely monitored marine 
  organisms, such as coral and seagrasses, particularly in the Caribbean and temperate 
  oceans. The worldwide increase in coral bleaching in 1997-1998 was coincident 
  with high water temperatures associated with El Ni&ntilde;o, but Harvell <i>et 
  al.</i> (1999) suggest that the demise of some corals might have been accelerated 
  by opportunistic infections affecting the temperature-stressed reef systems. 
  Talge <i>et al.</i> (1995) report a new disease in reef-dwelling foraminifera, 
  with implications for coastal sedimentation.</p>
<p>ENSO cycles and increased water temperatures have been correlated with Dermo 
  disease (caused by the protozoan parasite <i>Perkinsus marinus</i>) and MSX (multinucleated 
  spore unknown) disease in oysters along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In 
  addition to affecting marine hosts, several viruses, protozoa, and bacteria 
  affected by climatic factors can affect people, by direct contact or by seafood 
  consumption. Many of the reported cases of water-borne diseases involve gastrointestinal 
  illnesses; some can be fatal in infants, elderly people, and people with weakened 
  immune systems (ASM, 1998).</p>
<p>The bacterium <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>, which is found in oysters and is potentially 
  lethal to humans with immune-system deficiencies, becomes more abundant as water 
  temperature increases (Lipp and Rose, 1997). The incidence and severity of cholera 
  (<i>Vibrio cholerae</i>) epidemics associated with marine plankton also has 
  been linked with prolonged elevated water temperature. Annual epidemics of cholera 
  in Bangladesh have been correlated with increased SST and sea-surface height 
  (Harvell <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
