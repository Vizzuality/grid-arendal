<h3>6.4.2. Beaches, Barriers, and Cliff Coasts</h3>
<p>Sandy coasts shaped and maintained primarily by wave and tidal processes occupy 
  about 20% of the global coastline (Bird, 1993). A smaller proportion consists 
  of gravel and cobble-boulder beaches and related landforms, occurring in tectonically 
  active and high-relief regions and in mid- to high-latitude areas of former 
  glaciation. Coral rubble beaches and islands are common in low-latitude reefal 
  areas. Any analysis of climate-change impacts on the coastal zone should include 
  beaches and barriers of sand and/or gravel as well as coastal cliffs and bluffs.</p>
<p>Over the past 100 years or so, about 70% of the world's sandy shorelines 
  have been retreating, about 20-30% have been stable, and less than 10% 
  have been advancing. Bird (1993) argues that with global warming and sea-level 
  rise there will be tendencies for currently eroding shorelines to erode further, 
  stable shorelines to begin to erode, and accreting shorelines to wane or stabilize. 
  Local changes in coastal conditions and particularly in sediment supply may 
  modify these tendencies, although Nicholls (1998) has indicated that accelerated 
  sea-level rise in coming decades makes general erosion of sandy shores more 
  likely.</p>
<p>Previous discussions of shoreline response to climate change have considered 
  the well-known simple relations between sea-level rise and shoreline retreat 
  of Bruun (1962). This two-dimensional model assumes maintenance of an equilibrium 
  nearshore profile in the cross-shore direction as sea level rises. Some papers 
  have supported this approach for long-term shoreline adjustment (Mimura and 
  Nobuoka, 1996; Leatherman <i>et al.</i>, 2000); others have suggested various 
  refinements (Komar, 1998a). Although the model's basic assumptions are 
  rarely satisfied in the real world (Bruun, 1988; Eitner, 1996; Trenhaile, 1997), 
  its heuristic appeal and simplicity have led to extensive use in coastal vulnerability 
  assessments for estimating shoreline retreat under rising sea levels, with varying 
  degrees of qualification (Richmond <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Lanfredi <i>et al.</i>, 
  1998; Stewart <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Erroneous results can be expected in many 
  situations, particularly where equilibrium profile development is inhibited, 
  such as by the presence of reefs or rock outcrops in the nearshore (Riggs <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1995). Moreover, Kaplin and Selivanov (1995) have argued that the applicability 
  of the Bruun Rule, based on an equilibrium approach, will diminish under possible 
  future acceleration of sea-level rise.</p>
<p>Few models of shoreline response incorporate large-scale impacts of sea-level 
  rise coupled to changes in sediment availability. Efforts to address this shortcoming 
  have been pioneered by Cowell and Thom (1994) for sandy barrier-dune complexes 
  and Forbes <i>et al.</i> (1995) for gravel barriers. Although these parametric 
  models incorporate sediment supply as well as sea-level change, they are still 
  in the early stages of development and are useful primarily to indicate general 
  patterns of response. A multifaceted approach is needed to incorporate other 
  factors such as longshore and cross-shore variability in shore-zone morphology, 
  sediment supply, texture and composition, nonlinear shore-zone response to storms 
  and storm sequences (Forbes <i>et al.</i>, 1995), tectonic history of the site, 
  and the presence or absence of biotic protection such as mangroves or other 
  strand vegetation. </p>
<p>Impact assessment, adaptation actions, and other management decisions must 
  consider all of these factors within a coastal systems context. Temporal variation 
  in storminess and wind climate can produce significant coastal adjustments (Forbes 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997a). Another important component of analysis involves historical 
  trends of shoreline change, including variability caused by storms or other 
  anomalous events (Douglas <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Gorman <i>et al.</i>, 1998). 
  This analysis can provide essential baseline data to enable comparisons in the 
  future, albeit prior to anticipated climate-change impacts.</p>
<p>Field studies and numerical simulation of long-term gravel barrier evolution 
  in formerly glaciated bays of eastern Canada (Forbes <i>et al.</i>, 1995) have 
  revealed how sediment supply from coastal cliffs may be positively correlated 
  with the rate of relative sea-level rise. In this case, rising relative sea 
  level favors barrier progradation, but the system switches to erosional retreat 
  when the rate of sea-level rise diminishes, cliff erosion ceases, and no new 
  sediment is supplied to the beach. Along the South American coast, El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events are linked to higher-than-average precipitation causing increased sediment 
  discharge to the Peruvian coast, leading to the formation of gravel beach-ridge 
  sequences at several sites (Sandweiss <i>et al.</i>, 1998).</p>
<p>In assessing coastal response to sea-level rise, the relevant sedimentary system 
  may be defined in terms of large-scale coastal cells, bounded by headlands or 
  equivalent transitions&#151;typically one to several tens of kilometers in length 
  and up to hundreds of kilometers in some places (Wijnberg and Terwindt, 1995). 
  Within such cells, coastal orientation in relation to dominant storm wind and 
  wave approach direction can be very important (H&eacute;quette <i>et al.</i>, 
  1995; Short <i>et al.</i>, 2000), and sediment redistribution may lead to varying 
  rates and/or directions of shoreline migration between zones of sediment erosion 
  and deposition.</p>
<p>Changes in wave or storm patterns may occur under climate change (Schubert 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). In the North Atlantic, a multidecadal trend of increased 
  wave height is observed, but the cause is poorly understood and the impacts 
  are unclear. Changing atmospheric forcing also has been suggested as a process 
  contributing to increases in mean water level along the North Sea coast, independent 
  of eustatic and isostatic contributions to relative sea level. Changes in large-scale 
  ocean-atmospheric circulation and climate regimes such as ENSO and the Pacific 
  Decadal Oscillation have implications for coastal beach and barrier stability 
  (see <a href="#box6-4">Box 6-4</a>).</p>
<p>Erosion of unlithified cliffs is promoted by rising sea levels but may be constrained 
  or enhanced by geotechnical properties and other antecedent conditions (Shaw 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998a; Wilcock <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Bray and Hooke (1997) review 
  the possible effects of sea-level rise on soft-rock cliffs over a 50- to 100-year 
  planning scale. They evaluate different methods of analyzing historical recession 
  rates and provide simple predictive models to estimate cliff sensitivity to 
  sea-level rise in southern England. Historical observations of cliff erosion 
  under an accelerating sea level suggest, however, that the results of such methods 
  must be interpreted carefully.</p>
<p>If El Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions become more prevalent (Timmermann <i>et al.</i>, 
  1999), increases in the rate of cliff erosion may occur along the Pacific coasts 
  of North and South America (Kaminsky <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Komar, 1998a,b). For 
  example, El Ni&ntilde;o events raise sea level along the California coast and 
  are marked by the presence of larger than average, and more damaging, waves 
  and increased precipitation. These conditions and the changed direction of wave 
  attack combine to increase sea-cliff erosion on the central California coast, 
  particularly on southerly or southwesterly facing cliffs. An increase in El 
  Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions with global warming would very likely increase sea-cliff 
  erosion along this section of coast and endanger infrastructure and property 
  (Storlazzi and Griggs, 2000).</p>

      <p><b>Box 6-4. Changes in Wave Climate, Storm Waves, and Surges</b><br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
        Over the long term, beaches and coastal barriers are adjusted in plan 
        shape, profile morphology, and geographical position to factors such as 
        sediment type and availability; wave climate, including prevailing wave 
        energy and direction; and episodic storm waves and storm surge events. 
        Few studies have been made of potential changes in prevailing ocean wave 
        heights and directions as a consequence of climate change and sea-level 
        rise, even though such changes can be expected. Similarly, changes in 
        the magnitude of storm waves and surges with a higher sea level can be 
        expected to reach to higher elevations on land than at present, as well 
        as to extend further inland. Changes cannot be expected to be uniform, 
        however, and impacts will vary locally and regionally. </p>
      <p>The following case studies illustrate these points and highlight variations 
        in prevailing storm wave/surge trends, differences in attribution and 
        in the nature of past and potential coastal erosion and accretion impacts. 
      </p>
      <p><b><i>Changes in wind generated ocean waves in North Atlantic Ocean</i></b><br>
        Over the past 30 years, visual estimates from merchant ships and instrumental 
        records suggest that significant wave height increases of 0.1-0.3 
        m have occurred over the whole of the North Atlantic except the west and 
        central subtropics. The coastal response to this change in wave climate 
        has not been documented.<br>

      <p><b><i>Changes in extreme storm surges off Western Europe: The recent 
        record</i></b><br>
        Storm surge activity in the Irish Sea and North Sea during the 1960s and 
        1970s reached levels unprecedented since the 1900s. These levels were 
        followed by a sharp decline in the 1980s, taking the number of surges 
        back to the levels of decades before the 1960s. Changes in pressure conditions 
        could be a manifestation of shifts in storm tracks. Changes are part of 
        natural variability on decadal time scales rather than long-term climate 
        change resulting from anthropogenic influences.<br>
        <i>Source: Holt (1999).</i></p>
      <p><b><i>Changes in waves and storm activity off Western Europe with climate 
        change</i></b><br>
        A high-resolution climate change experiment mimicking global warming resulted 
        in a weak increase in storm activity and extreme wave heights in the Bay 
        of Biscay and the North Sea; waves and storm action decreased slightly 
        along the Norwegian coast. A weak increase in storm surges in the North 
        Sea can be expected.<br>
        <i>Source: WASA Group (1998).</i></p>
      <p><b><i>Beach rotation and the Southern Oscillation in eastern Australia</i></b><br>
        Beach profiles measured at monthly intervals along Narrabeen Beach (Sydney) 
        from 1976 to 1999 suggest a cyclic beach oscillation, with two cycles 
        over the 23-year period; the profiles also suggest that the beach is rotating 
        in a cyclic pattern around a central point. These changes have been related 
        to ENSO. When the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is positive, there 
        is a greater prevalence of east to northerly waves; these waves help build 
        out the southern beach. When the SOI is negative, southerly waves dominate 
        the wave climate, leading to a northerly shift of sand, thus feeding beach 
        accretion in the north while the south end of the beach is eroded. If 
        more El Ni&ntilde;o-like conditions prevail in the future, a net change 
        in shoreline position can be expected.<br>

      <p><b><i>Venice and the northern Adriatic coast: reduction in storm surges 
        as a result of recent climate change?</i></b><br>
        Coastal flooding and damaging storm surges generated by the bora and other 
        easterly winds affect the northern Adriatic Sea. Analysis of wind records 
        from Trieste (1957-1996) show a decline in frequency of such winds. 
        This decline may be caused in part by interdecadal variability, though 
        their persistence suggests that it may be a consequence of recent global 
        warming and less frequent drifts of polar cold air toward middle latitudes.<br>

        change</i></b><br>
        Outputs from a simple storm wave generation model that uses real-time 
        wind data for the 1980s have been compared with simulations representing 
        a 10% higher wind strength and a 1-m sea-level rise. Under this scenario, 
        storm waves would increase in height; their angle of incidence would remain 
        unchanged.<br>
