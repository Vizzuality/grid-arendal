<h4>11.2.6.4. Financial Aspects </h4>
<p>The financial services sector typically includes banking, insurance, stock 
  exchanges, and brokerages, as well as financial services firms such as investment 
  banks, advisory services, and asset management, among others. Banking crises, 
  currency speculation, and devaluation have become common in recent years in 
  Asia and now are key policy concerns. Climate change could have serious consequences 
  for this sector because many adaptation and mitigation measures such as crop 
  insurance against floods or droughts are mediated or implemented through this 
  sector. The implications and role of risk management techniques such as derivatives, 
  options, and swaps are some of the new developments in financial services to 
  dampen the impact of disasters on national finances.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of literature on the economic impacts of global warming 
  that takes adaptation into account in estimating the imposed costs of climate 
  change, but these studies fall short of specifically estimating the costs and 
  benefits of adaptation. The basis for estimating adaptation costs is the economic 
  opportunity cost of a product or activity. Estimating this cost requires price 
  and other data from market transactions such as sectoral coverage and assumptions 
  about markets, behaviors, and policy instruments in addition to economic growth 
  path as a function of socioeconomic conditions, resource endowment, and government 
  policies. Multiple baseline choices are critical in the estimation and evaluation 
  of the financial costs, based on accurate reporting of financial flows (see 
  also <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<p>Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by a factor of three 
  since 1960, the number of weather-related disasters has increased four-fold, 
  real economic losses sevenfold, and insured losses 12-fold in the same period 
  (see also <a href="321.htm">Chapter 8</a>). These losses have had some notable 
  regional impacts&#151;particularly in developing countries of Asia, where the 
  impacts of climate change are expected to be greatest in terms of loss of life 
  and effects on investment. Individual large events have shown visible short-term 
  impacts on insurance profitability and pricing and public finance. There is 
  only limited penetration of or access to insurance in developing countries. 
  This situation makes them more vulnerable and will impair their ability to adapt. 
  The property/casualty insurance segment and small specialized or undiversified 
  companies have greater sensitivity. Coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies 
  will depend largely on public or international support. Given finite financial 
  resources and international aid, increased climate-related losses would compete 
  with development efforts. </p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change presents complex challenges to the finance sector. 
  Increasing risk could lead to a greater volume of traditional business, as well 
  as development of new risk and financing products (e.g., catastrophe bonds). 
  However, increased variability of loss events would result in greater actuarial 
  uncertainty. The design of an optimal adaptation program in any country would 
  have to be based on comparison of damages avoided with the costs of adaptation. 
  Other factors, particularly in developing countries with incomplete markets, 
  also enter the decisionmaking process&#151;such as the impacts of policies on 
  different social groups in society, particularly those that are vulnerable; 
  employment generation and opportunities; improved air and water quality; and 
  the impacts of policies on broader concerns such as sustainability.</p>
