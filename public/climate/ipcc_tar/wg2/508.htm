<h2>13.3. Adaptation Potential </h2>
<p>In this section, our analysis is restricted to adaptation in the major primary 
  sectors (water, soils, ecosystems, agriculture) and in coastal regions. These 
  are the main sectors where adaptation will be needed. </p>
<h3><a name="1331"></a>13.3.1. Water </h3>
<p>There are, broadly, two different approaches to adaptation in the water sector: 
  "supply side" (change the water supply) and "demand side" (alter exposure to 
  stress). <a href="#tab136">Table 13-6</a> summarizes some supply-side and demand-side 
  techniques that are available to cope with adverse impacts in the water sector 
  and may be appropriate in the face of climate change. "Supply-side" techniques 
  to address water resources and risks are most widely known and used at present. 
  In terms of water supply, these strategies include building new supply and distribution 
  infrastructure and managing existing sources more efficiently. There is an increasing 
  tendency toward conjunctive use of different sources within a region. Supply-side 
  techniques in flood management are termed structural adjustments; they involve 
  actions to lessen flood peaks and keep floodwaters away from at-risk property. 
  Demand-side techniques historically have been less well used but are the focus 
  of increasing attention. In terms of water supply, the most obvious demand-side 
  approach is to reduce the demand (or slow the increase in demand) for the water 
  resource through a range of measures, including differential pricing, public 
  awareness campaigns, or statutory requirements for WUE (e.g., for domestic appliances).

<p>Attention to date has been concentrated on supply-side options; demand-side 
  techniques are less well-known and the subject of considerable technological 
  advance. Although there is a good deal of awareness of broad options, there 
  has been less research into applying these options in an uncertain future: How, 
  for example, can a water distribution network be designed so that it can be 
  incrementally updated as more information on climate change appears, rather 
  than built to a single fixed standard? </p>
<p>An adaptation in one aspect of the water environment or in one area might have 
  a severe effect on another aspect or area. For example, increased use of a river 
  to maintain supplies may impact the instream environment. Increased storage 
  of water in a reservoir over the winter might reduce its ability to prevent 
  flooding. Finally, the time scales over which adaptation can occur vary. Some 
  adaptive strategies can be implemented with little warning and can be easily 
  amended. Others take longer to implement and, once completed, are harder to 
  change. For example, it typically takes decades for a reservoir to move from 
  the planning stage to completion. Urban storm drainage has a relatively short 
  lead time but a very long design life. An ideal adaptive strategy is one that 
  can be altered as more information becomes available. However, the adaptive 
  response by a water management agency to climate change will depend on procedures 
  for considering strategies, as well as adaptive capacity. </p>
<h3><a name="1332"></a>13.3.2. Soils </h3>
<p>The use of land management techniques in adaptation to climate change will 
  seek to maintain soil functions. A summary of appropriate techniques and their 
  relationships to the soil functions and properties discussed earlier in this 
  chapter is given in <a href="509.htm#tab137">Table 13-7</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="1333"></a>13.3.3. Ecosystems </h3>
<p>Tundra areas have practically no adaptive options available. The only possible 
  response is to better protect areas with particular value (e.g., for bird life) 
  from other stresses such as land exploitation and tourism. In boreal regions, 
  many effects of climate change and CO<sub>2</sub> increase, as noted above, 
  are positive in terms of productivity. Areas that are under threat (e.g., low-productivity 
  mountain forests) have no adaptive options available. If changing water tables 
  present a significant problem, boreal wetlands could receive technical measures 
  for controlling water level, but such measures are unlikely to be technically 
  and economically feasible in many areas. Other approaches to adaptation can 
  include establishment of buffer areas around wetlands, promotion of sustainable 
  uses of wetlands to minimize additional stresses brought on by climate change, 
  and restoration of already destroyed wetland habitats (Hartig et al., 1997). 
</p>
<p>Water shortage in parts of the temperate zone may be compensated to some extent 
  by additional irrigation or river management. To achieve any large-scale effect, 
  however, such measures would have to be applied in economically infeasible dimensions. 
  Most other areas will have positive effects and therefore no adaptive problems. 
</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, many landscapes face an acute management problem already 
  without climate change because bush encroachment in earlier agricultural areas 
  is affecting many ecosystems with respect to species richness and susceptibility 
  to fire. Climate change may aggravate these developments in some areas. It is 
  not likely that there are direct ways to adapt to these trends. </p>
<p>With regard to forests, the central problem is that any potential adaptation 
  requires long-term planning. Essentially, adaptation to climate would require 
  planting trees today that will be suitable for such a future climate. However, 
  given our uncertainties in the prediction of future climate and the formulation 
  of models that are used to assess its ecological impacts, it is unlikely that 
  adaptation measures will be put into practice in a timely manner. </p>
