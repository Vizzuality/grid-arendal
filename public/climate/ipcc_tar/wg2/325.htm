<p><a name="fig82"></a>Weather-related events of all magnitudes resulted in US$707 
  billion in insured and uninsured economic losses between 1985 and 1999 (Munich 
  Re, 2000). A longer term comparison of large catastrophic events over the past 
  50 years reveals that economic losses (adjusted for inflation) increased by 
  a factor of 10.3 (<a href="324.htm#fig81">Figure 8-1</a>). Over this same period, 
  population grew by a factor of 2.4.</p>
<p>One of the vexing dilemmas in analyzing such historical data is disentangling 
  causal factors related to human-induced climatic change, natural variability, 
  and those having to do with human activity that could accelerate or dampen measured 
  impacts. Numerous human factors are in operation that contribute to the upward 
  trends in real economic losses, including population growth, rising standard 
  of living, urbanization and industrialization in high-risk regions, vulnerability 
  of modern societies and technologies, environmental degradation, penetration 
  of insurance, and changing societal attitudes toward compensation (the latter 
  two factors may lead to an increase in losses reported). Data on the numbers 
  of events also show an increase in many cases. The number of disasters (defined 
  as annual requests from states for federal disaster declarations) has roughly 
  doubled in the United States since the early 1980s (Anderson, 2000). It is relevant 
  to note here that such requests involve considerations of significant social 
  effects (Kunkel <i>et al</i>., 1999); as a consequence, it is an indirect and 
  subjective proxy for the frequency of events.</p>
<p>Growth trends in non-climate-related losses have been relatively constant over 
  the past 3 decades. Losses from human-induced catastrophes have remained relatively 
  constant (Swiss Re, 1999a). Earthquake losses have increased, but more slowly 
  than weather-related losses (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 1999). The number of disasters 
  causing more than 1% GDP damage to affected countries has increased two to three 
  times as rapidly for weather-related disasters as for earthquakes in the period 
  1963-1992 (United Nations, 1994).</p>
<p>Insurers have pointed out that local environmental factors such as soil degradation, 
  loss of biodiversity, lack of drinkable water, pollution, deforestation, forest 
  degradation, and land-use changes can amplify the impacts of weather-related 
  catastrophes (Zeng and Kelly, 1997). As an illustration, the extent of flood 
  losses from Hurricane Mitch was attributed in part to deforestation in Central 
  America.</p>
<p>Attempts to analyze the underlying causes of trends in natural disasters also 
  must allow for the effects of human activities that offset growth factors (Kunkel 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). A considerable leveling off or reduction in loss of life 
  during U.S. disasters is one indicator that mitigation has been effective (Easterling 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000a). Loss-reduction efforts&#151;typically unaccounted for 
  in analyses we have seen&#151;include considerable efforts to avert or reduce 
  natural disaster impacts (e.g., coastal protection structures along coastlines; 
  cloud seeding to deflect hailstorms; improved building codes; tightened land-use 
  zoning; enhanced fire-suppression capacity; improved weather forecasts and early-warning 
  systems; and improved disaster preparedness, response, and recovery). Within 
  the insurance arena, increasing deductibles (the initial tier of loss costs 
  paid for by the insured) and withdrawal of coverage from particularly high-risk 
  areas have reduced observed losses. The literature has not attempted to quantify 
  the contribution of these activities.</p>
<p>The relative contributions of human and climatic factors to the changing patterns 
  of losses varies, depending on place and type of event (see <a href="326.htm#tab81">Table 
  8-1</a>; also see Easterling <i>et al.</i>, 2000a,b for a review). U.S. studies 
  have found that demography largely explains increases in losses for hurricanes, 
  wind, hail, and tornado events, whereas winter storm damage has mixed causation 
  (Pielke and Landsea, 1998; Changnon, 1999; Changnon and Changnon, 1999; Kunkel 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). In addition, decadal-scale trends have been discerned 
  for tropical cyclones. There is good evidence that the intensity and frequency 
  of precipitation and flood-related extreme events in the United States is increasing 
  (Zeng and Kelly, 1997; Karl and Knight, 1998; Pielke and Downton, 2000). This 
  trend also has been found for precipitation in many other parts of the world 
  (see <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a>). In a study of hailstorms in France, Dessens 
  (1995) used insurance loss information as a proxy for storm occurrence and found 
  a statistically significant upward trend between 1946 and 1990.</p>
<p>In one global analysis, Munich Re (1999b) estimates that economic losses from 
  large natural disasters increased two-fold between the 1970s and 1990s, after 
  correcting for inflation, insurance penetration and pricing effects, and increases 
  in the material standard of living. A similar result was reported for UK buildings 
  in the SAR (Dlugolecki <i>et al.</i>, 1996).</p>
<p>Based on the findings of TAR WGI, the information summarized in <a href="326.htm#tab81">Table 
  8-1</a>, and the analysis presented above, we conclude that some part of the 
  upward trend in the cost of weather-related disasters illustrated in <a href="324.htm#fig81">Figure 
  8-1</a> is linked to socioeconomic factors (increased wealth, shifts of population 
  to the coasts, etc.) and some part is linked to climatic factors such as observed 
  changes in precipitation and drought events. There are regional differences 
  in the balance of these two causes.</p>
