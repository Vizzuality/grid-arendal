<h4>4.3.6.2.1. Cold and cool temperate climates</h4>
<p>These areas are characterized by precipitation during winter falling as snow 
  and include mountainous and low-lying regions. A major proportion of annual 
  streamflow is formed by snow melting in spring. These areas include large parts 
  of North America, northern and eastern Europe, most of Russia, northern China, 
  and much of central Asia. The most important climate change effect in these 
  regions is a change in the timing of streamflow through the year. A smaller 
  proportion of precipitation during winter falls as snow, so there is proportionately 
  more runoff in winter and, as there is less snow to melt, less runoff during 
  spring. Increased temperatures, in effect, reduce the size of the natural reservoir 
  storing water during winter. In very cold climates (such as in Siberia and northern 
  Russia), there is little change in the timing of streamflow because winter precipitation 
  continues to fall as snow with higher temperatures. The largest effects are 
  in the most &#147;marginal&#148; snow-dominated regime areas.</p>
<p>The effects of climate change on the magnitude of annual runoff and flows through 
  the year are much less consistent than the effect on streamflow timing because 
  they depend not on the temperature increase but on the change in precipitation. 
  In general, precipitation increases in high-latitude areas under most scenarios, 
  but in lower latitudes precipitation may decrease. Kazcmarek et al. (1997), 
  for example, show a decrease in annual runoff in Poland under a Geophysical 
  Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)-based scenario (by around 20% by the 2050s) 
  but an increase under a Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) scenario 
  (by as much as 20%); in both cases, the season of maximum flow shifts from spring 
  to winter.</p>
<p>Similar patterns are found for rivers in mountainous regions or draining from 
  mountains. The Rhine and Danube, for example, would both see a reduction in 
  spring flows and an increase in winter runoff (Grabs, 1997; Starosolszky and 
  Gauzer, 1998), as would rivers draining east and west from the Rocky Mountains 
  in North America.</p>
<h4><a name="43622"></a>4.3.6.2.2. Mild temperate climates</h4>
<p>Hydrological regimes in these regions are dominated by the seasonal cycles 
  of rainfall and evaporation; snowfall and snowmelt are not important. Here, 
  climate change tends to affect the magnitude of flows in different seasons&#151;by 
  an amount that depends on the change in rainfall&#151;and may lead to an exaggerated 
  seasonal cycle, but it generally does not affect the timing of flows through 
  the year. In the UK, for example, most scenarios result in an increase in winter 
  runoff and, particularly in the south, a decrease in summer runoff (Arnell and 
  Reynard, 1996); similar patterns are found across most of western Europe under 
  most scenarios (Arnell, 1999a). Low flows tend to occur during summer, and changes 
  in low-flow frequency are closely related to changes in the balance between 
  summer rainfall and summer evaporation. Across most mid-latitude temperate regions, 
  summer rainfall would decline with global warming, leading to a reduction in 
  low flows. </p>
<p>The detailed effect of a given change in climate, however, depends to a large 
  extent on the geological characteristics of the catchment. Studies in the UK 
  (Arnell and Reynard, 1996) and Belgium (Gellens and Roulin, 1998) have indicated 
  that in catchments with considerable groundwater, changes in summer flows are 
  largely a function of the change not in summer rainfall but in rainfall during 
  the winter recharge season.</p>
<h4><a name="43623"></a>4.3.6.2.3. Arid and semi-arid regions</h4>
<p>River flows in arid and semi-arid regions are very sensitive to changes in 
  rainfall: A given percentage change in rainfall can produce a considerably larger 
  percentage change in runoff. There have been relatively few studies in such 
  regions since the SAR, but work has been done in southern Africa (Schulze, 1997), 
  Australia (Bates et al., 1996), northern China (Ying and Huang, 1996), and southern 
  Russia (Georgiyevsky et al., 1996; Shiklomanov, 1998). </p>
<h4><a name="43624"></a>4.3.6.2.4. Humid tropical regions</h4>
<p>Runoff regimes in these regions are very much influenced by the timing and 
  duration of the rainy season or seasons. Climate change therefore may affect 
  river flows not only through a change in the magnitude of rainfall but also 
  through possible changes in the onset or duration of rainy seasons (such as 
  those caused by monsoon).</p>
