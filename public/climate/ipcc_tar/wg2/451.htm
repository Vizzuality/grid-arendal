<h4>11.2.6.3. Industry, Energy, and Transportation</h4>
<p>In many cities in the developing countries of Asia, movement of the labor force 
  from dispersed agricultural centers to concentrated industrial sectors has increased 
  urbanization and expansion of the suburban area where industries are located. 
  This situation has caused serious traffic, housing, and sanitary problems. Moreover, 
  a substantial share of industrial growth in developing countries revolves around 
  the transformation of raw materials into industrial products such as steel, 
  paper, and chemicals. Production of industrial chemicals has been shifting from 
  developed countries to developing countries of Asia in recent years. Not only 
  are these processes resource-intensive, in addition, industries such as electricity 
  generation, chemicals and petroleum refining, mining, paper production, and 
  leather tanning tend to produce a disproportionately large amount of hazardous 
  and toxic wastes and already have caused serious air and water pollution. Moreover, 
  because of poor regulatory capacity, developing countries have become targets 
  for dumping of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by multinational 
  companies. </p>
<p>In developing countries of Asia, an increase in paper consumption of more than 
  80% is expected to occur by 2010. However, a shortfall in the supply of all 
  wood products and especially pulp and paper is likely in the 21st century as 
  a result of declines in natural vegetation productivity. This trend will put 
  immense pressure on unmanaged forests of Asia. Some countries in Asia have resorted 
  to agroforestry and farm woodlots to meet their increasing demand for pulp and 
  paper on a near-term basis. Over the long term, however, anticipated growth 
  in demand for wood products of all types probably will necessitate changes in 
  forest management practices such as greater reliance on industrial plantations. 
  Heat stress to livestock herded in open areas would reduce animal weight gain, 
  dairy and wool production, and feed conversion efficiency in arid and semi-arid 
  Asia (IPCC, 1996). An increase in the frequency of drought and heavy rainfall 
  could result in a decline in tea yield in Sri Lanka (IPCC, 1998). Climate change 
  could have adverse impacts on agroindustries such as food, beverages, tobacco, 
  natural fiber textiles, leather, wood, and rubber.</p>
<p>The manufacturing industry could be affected indirectly through the availability 
  of water, energy supply, and transportation systems throughout Asia. Mining 
  operations, which are required to produce raw materials such as coal (practiced 
  intensively in China and India because of heavy demand), exposes sulfur- and 
  iron-bearing rocks to weathering and erosion that would be aggravated by global 
  warming. Mineral industries discharge large amounts of waste ore known as tailings. 
  Manufacturing industries release effluent to the air and water during production 
  processes. For instance, cement production and foundry operations release particulates; 
  metal industries release SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HF, and organic solvents; 
  and chemical plants release particulates, SO<sub>2</sub>, and various hydrocarbons. 
  Food processing, pulp and paper industries, brewing, and tanning industries 
  release effluents in the form of contaminated water and sediments. This degradation 
  of the environment may be exacerbated by climate change.</p>
<p>Climate change will adversely affect hydroelectric energy generation in Asia, 
  exacerbating already depleted water resources in several major rivers in Asia. 
  Increased humidity and hence more cloudiness in a warmer atmosphere could inhibit 
  direct solar radiation. Photovoltaic technology, which is used extensively in 
  Indonesia and a few other south Asian countries for remote area electrification 
  programs, could be jeopardized. Changes in wind patterns could affect existing 
  windmill installations. Availability of biomass, particularly fuel wood, depends 
  on forest area and the quantity of rainfall. In areas with excess rainfall, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and higher temperatures could increase fuelwood production 
  and supply. Geothermal resources also may be affected by changes in precipitation 
  patterns. For instance, an increase in rainfall could increase recharge of groundwater 
  for most geothermal fields (IPCC, 1996).</p>
<p>In general, no major impacts of climate change on the production and distribution 
  facilities of fossil fuels are likely, other than policies aimed at reducing 
  GHG emissions from burning of fossil fuels. However, offshore exploration, production, 
  and distribution facilities of oil and natural gas would be influenced by sea-level 
  rise and extreme weather events such as cyclonic storms and associated surges 
  that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Most power plants and oil 
  refineries in Asia also are located along the coastlines to facilitate transportation 
  and easy access to cooling water supply. Construction of seawalls will be needed 
  to protect these facilities against sea-level rise (Mimura et al., 1998). </p>
<p>As reported in IPCC (1996), energy demand for heating, cooling, and agriculture 
  activities can be influenced by climate change. Global warming would increase 
  energy demand for cooling in the tropical Asia region and reduce energy demand 
  for heating in boreal Asia. A similar pattern could be observed in temperate 
  Asia, either in summer or winter. For agricultural activities, more energy would 
  be needed for irrigation pumping during warmer weather as the soil becomes drier. 
</p>
<p>Tourism and outdoor recreational activities are likely to be disrupted in pattern 
  by climate change. Global warming is expected to shorten the skiing season in 
  many areas and affect the feasibility of some ski facilities (IPCC, 1998). Summer 
  recreational activities in coastal recreational areas may be affected with the 
  inundation of beaches. In Malaysia, for example, unprotected resorts located 
  near the coastline would be lost through erosion; others that are not affected 
  by erosion or inundation will cease to operate because of the loss of beaches 
  (Teh, 1997). The increased frequency of forest fires because of drier conditions 
  in Indonesia during the 1997 El Ni&ntilde;o resulted in haze that affected the 
  tourism industries of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia (Schweithelm et al., 
  1999). Some wildlife reservation areas that are famous as tourist spots may 
  lose their attraction because of the disappearance of flora and fauna in the 
  changed ecosystems. For example, it has been suggested that the flowering dates 
  of cherry blossoms in Japan and Korea could move 3-4 days earlier if air 
  temperatures during March increase by 1&deg;C (Seino et al., 1998). Extreme 
  weather events in highland regions also would threaten rafting, mountain climbing, 
  and other high-altitude tourism.</p>
<p>Transportation systems, including infrastructure and fuel, can be influenced 
  directly and indirectly by climate change. A longer rainy season, melting of 
  ice deposits, and sea-level rise could directly damage infrastructures such 
  as roads, railways, runways, terminals, airports, and harbors, thereby disrupting 
  transportation systems. Climate change would increase the inherent necessity 
  for expansion of infrastructure and alter fuel consumption patterns. In Siberia, 
  for instance, frozen rivers that currently are used as roads would require a 
  shift to water transport or construction of permanent roads with shorter winters. 
  As reported in IPCC (1996), similar impacts could be experienced from permafrost 
  melting.</p>
