<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Latin America region is remarkably heterogeneous in terms of climate, ecosystems, 
  human population distribution, and cultural traditions. Land-use changes have 
  become a major force driving ecosystem changes. Complex climatic patterns, which 
  result in part from interactions of atmospheric flow with topography, intermingled 
  with land-use and land-cover change, make it difficult to identify common patterns 
  of vulnerability to climate change in the region. Water resources, ecosystems, 
  agriculture and plantation forestry, sea-level rise, and human health may be 
  considered the most important among the various sectors that may be impacted 
  by climate change.</p>
<p><b>Climate, Extreme Events, and Water Resources </b></p>
<p>In most of Latin America, there are no clear long-term tendencies in mean surface 
  temperature. Some changes in regional atmospheric circulation have been detected. 
  For instance, the south Atlantic anticyclone has intensified, and the subtropical 
  jet stream in South America has shifted south. These phenomena may be a sign 
  of changes associated with climate change as they already are impacted by the 
  El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena and extreme events.</p>
<p>The cryosphere in Latin America, which is composed of glaciers in the high 
  Andes and three major ice areas in southern South America, may be severely affected 
  by global warming. It has been well established that glaciers in Latin America, 
  particularly along the tropical Andes, have receded in recent decades. Glaciers 
  contribute to streamflow in rivers of semi-arid and arid areas of South America. 
  Streamflows in Andean rivers&#151;for example, in northwest Peru&#151;exhibit 
  tendencies that may be related to glacial extent changes before and after the 
  mid-1970s. However, there also is evidence that rainfall and river flows in 
  other regions of Latin America correspond only to interdecadal variability in 
  the hydrological cycle. For instance, rainfall and streamflow in Amazonia and 
  northeast Brazil exhibit interdecadal variability linked to Pacific and Atlantic 
  Ocean influences. Warming in high mountains also could affect mountain sports 
  and tourist activities, which represent an important source of income in the 
  economies of some countries in the region. </p>
<p>At a subregional level, precipitation trends in Latin America vary. Precipitation 
  trends depend on the location and the length of the time series under study. 
  For instance, negative trends in some parts of Central America (e.g., Nicaragua) 
  contrast with positive trends in northeastern Argentina, southern Brazil, and 
  northwestern Mexico. Other regions, such as central-western Argentina, do not 
  show well-defined trends. This suggests, for instance, an increase in precipitation 
  in some regions of the mid-latitude Americas. </p>
<p>The Amazon River&#151;by far the world's largest river in terms of streamflow&#151;plays 
  an important role in the water cycle and water balance of much of South America. 
  Several model studies and field experiments show that about 50% of the rainfall 
  in the region originates as water recycled in the forest. In the Amazon region, 
  even small changes in evapotranspiration affect water vapor fluxes. Therefore, 
  deforestation is likely to reduce precipitation because of a decrease in evapotranspiration, 
  leading to important runoff losses in areas within and beyond this basin. Any 
  reductions in rainfall would affect not only Amazonia but also Brazil's 
  central-south region, where most of the country's agriculture and silviculture 
  are located. However, with the current rate of deforestation of no more than 
  10% in Amazonia as a whole, discharge observations across the basin do not exhibit, 
  to date, any significant trends.</p>
<p>Although it is expected that tropical storms (e.g., tropical cyclones) will 
  increase their peak intensity under global warming (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a>), only some hints of such intensification in the tropical cyclones 
  affecting the Americas have been detected. Some studies based on model experiments 
  suggest that under climate change the hydrological cycle will be more intense, 
  with changes in the distribution of extreme heavy rainfall, wet spells, and 
  dry spells. Frequent severe droughts in Mexico during the past decade coincide 
  with some of these model findings. Even though it is uncertain how global warming 
  may affect the frequency and intensity of some extreme events, the infrequent 
  overlapping of hydrological and weather/climate events historically have given 
  rise to disasters, whose frequency may be enhanced by such warming.</p>
<p><b>El Ni&ntilde;o</b></p>
<p>It also has been suggested that under climate change, more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  mean conditions will be experienced. El Ni&ntilde;o differentially influences 
  precipitation and temperature in different parts of the region; for example, 
  it is related to dry conditions in northern northeast Brazil, northern Amazonia, 
  and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano. Southern Brazil and northwest Peru exhibit 
  anomalously wet conditions during these periods. In Mexico and the Caribbean 
  coast of Central America, there is compelling evidence of more winter precipitation 
  and less summer precipitation during El Ni&ntilde;o. Some of the most severe 
  droughts in Mexico in recent decades have occurred during El Ni&ntilde;o years. 
  During the 1997-1998 El Ni&ntilde;o event, droughts occurred in Amazonia, 
  Mexico, and Central America, favoring forest fires. Under climate change conditions, 
  the number of forest fires may increase. </p>
<p><b>Natural Ecosystems </b></p>
<p>Latin America contains a large percentage of the world's biodiversity, 
  and climate change could accelerate losses in biodiversity that already are 
  occurring. Some adverse impacts on species that can be related to regional changes 
  in climate have been observed. Studies show that climatic changes already are 
  affecting frogs and small mammals in Central America. The tropical forests play 
  an important role in the hydrological cycle of much of South America. Several 
  model studies and field experiments show that a large part of the rainfall in 
  the region originates as water recycled in the forest. Large-scale deforestation 
  is likely to result in increased surface temperatures, decreased evapotranspiration, 
  and reduced precipitation. Forest fragmentation and degradation has led to increased 
  vulnerability of forests to fire. Global warming and regional climate change 
  resulting from land-cover change may be acting synergistically to exacerbate 
  stress over the region's tropical ecosystems. </p>
<p>Mountain ranges and plateaus play an important role in determining not only 
  the Latin America climate and its hydrological cycle but also its large biodiversity. 
  Mountains constitute source regions of major rivers such as the Amazon, the 
  Parana, and the Orinoco. These river basins represent important habitats of 
  biological diversity and endemism and are highly vulnerable to extreme climate 
  conditions. </p>
<p>On decadal to centennial time scales, changes in precipitation and runoff may 
  have significant impacts on mangrove forest communities. Sea-level rise would 
  eliminate mangrove habitat at an approximate rate of 1% yr<sup>-1</sup>. The rate is much 
  faster in the Caribbean mainland (approximately 1.7% yr<sup>-1</sup>). This problem is 
  causing a decline in some of the region's fisheries at a similar rate because 
  most commercial shellfish use mangroves as nurseries or refuges. Coastal inundation 
  stemming from sea-level rise or flatland flooding resulting from climate change 
  therefore may seriously affect mangrove ecology and associated human economy.</p>
<p><b>Agriculture </b></p>
<p>Agricultural lands (excluding pastures) represent approximately 19% of the 
  total area of Latin America. For the past 40 years, the contribution of agriculture 
  to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Latin American countries has been on 
  the order of 10%. Therefore, this economic sector remains a key element of the 
  regional economy. An important aspect of this sector is that a large percentage 
  (30-40%) of the economically active population works in this sector. Agriculture 
  also is an important element for the food security of the poorest sectors of 
  the population. Under climate change conditions, subsistence farming could be 
  severely threatened in some parts of Latin America, such as northeastern Brazil. 
</p>
<p>Studies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay based on general circulation 
  models (GCMs) and crop models project decreased yields in several crops (e.g., 
  maize, wheat, barley, grapes), even when the direct effect of carbon dioxide 
  (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilization and the implementation of moderate adaptation measures at 
  the farm level are considered. It is likely that increases in temperature will 
  reduce crop yields in the region by shortening the crop cycle. However, the 
  lack of consistency in the various GCM precipitation scenarios makes it difficult 
  to have a precise scenario for crop production under climate change, even when 
  the relationships between precipitation and crop yields are well known. Increased 
  temperature, ultraviolet radiation, sea-level rise, and changes in pest ecology 
  may threaten food production as well (e.g., in Argentina). Climate change may 
  reduce silvicultural yields as a result of changes in water availability during 
  the dry season.</p>
<p><b>Human Health </b></p>
<p>The magnitude of the impacts of climate change on health in Latin America primarily 
  depends on the size, density, location, and wealth of the population. It has 
  been established that exposure to heat or cold waves has an influence on mortality 
  rates in risk groups in the region. The projected increase in temperature in 
  polluted cities, such as Mexico City or Santiago, may have an influence on human 
  health. There is evidence that the geographical distributions of vector-borne 
  diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue) in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Honduras 
  and infectious diseases (e.g., cholera, meningitis) in Peru and Cuba change 
  when temperature and precipitation increase. The exact distribution of these 
  diseases, however, is not clear.</p>
<p>It is likely that extreme weather events will increase death and morbidity 
  rates (injuries, infectious diseases, social problems, and damage to sanitary 
  infrastructure), as during the heavy rains in Mexico in 1999 or in Venezuela 
  in 1999. On longer time scales, El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a cause changes 
  in disease vector populations and the incidence of water-borne diseases in Brazil, 
  Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Venezuela. Extreme climate events appear to affect 
  the incidence of allergies in Mexico. Some economic and health problems could 
  be exacerbated in critical areas, fostering migrations from rural and small 
  urban settlements into major cities and giving rise to additional stress at 
  the national level and, at times, adversely affecting international relations 
  between neighboring countries. Therefore, under climate change conditions the 
  risks for human health in Latin America may increase.</p>
<p><b>Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability</b> </p>
<p>The economy of Latin American countries can be severely affected by extremes 
  of natural climate variability. There were more than 700 natural disasters in 
  the region between 1980 and 1998. For instance, Hurricane Mitch in 1998 resulted 
  in economic losses of approximately 40 and 70% of the gross national product 
  (GNP) in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively. Poverty and unequal distribution 
  of wealth may increase as a result of the negative effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Trade agreements are becoming increasingly important for Latin American economies. 
  In principle, they have been designed mainly to speed up socioeconomic development. 
  However, various elements that relate to environmental issues gradually are 
  being introduced into these agreements, including provisions related to climate 
  change. Environmental issues are beginning to be reflected in the environmental 
  legislation in the region. For instance, environmental impact assessments are 
  now required in most project developments. </p>
<p>Although climate change may bring benefits for certain regions of Latin America, 
  increasing environmental deterioration, combined with changes in water availability 
  and agricultural lands, may reduce these benefits to a negligible level. The 
  adaptive capacity of socioeconomic systems in Latin America is very low, particularly 
  with respect to extreme climate events, and vulnerability is high.</p>
