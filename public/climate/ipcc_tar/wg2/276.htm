<h2>5.9. Arctic and Alpine Ecosystems</h2>
<p>Arctic and alpine ecosystems are characterized by low human population densities. 
  However, they provide important goods and services locally and globally. At 
  the local scale, they are the resource base of many indigenous cultures and 
  provide recreation, food, and fiber to people in adjacent regions. At the global 
  level, arctic and boreal regions play an important role in the world's 
  climate system. They contain 40% of the world's reactive soil carbon (McGuire 
  et al., 1995); influence global heat transport through their impact on regional 
  water and energy exchange with the atmosphere; and determine freshwater input 
  to the Arctic Ocean, which influences bottom-water formation and thermohaline 
  circulation of the oceans. Alpine regions are important sources of freshwater 
  and hydropower for surrounding lowlands. Changes in these goods and services 
  would have socioeconomic impacts throughout the world.</p>
<p><a href="592.htm">Chapter 16</a> presents information on the effects of climate 
  on the physical environment of polar regions. The impacts of climate change 
  on high-mountain systems and arctic tundra are extensively reviewed in the SAR 
  by Beniston and Fox (1996) and Allen-Diaz (1996), respectively. This section 
  emphasizes the effects of climatic change particularly on ecosystem production, 
  carbon stores, biodiversity, and water flow&#151;which, in turn, can affect 
  the productivity especially of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<h3><a name="591"></a>5.9.1. State and Trends of Goods and Services</h3>
<h4><a name="5911"></a>5.9.1.1. Arctic Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Arctic and alpine tundra each occupy 4 million km<sup>2</sup> (K&ouml;rner, 
  1999). Approximately 25% of the tundra is ice-covered, 25% shrub-dominated, 
  and the rest dominated by herbaceous plants. Soil carbon stocks in boreal and 
  tundra peatlands are large (see <a href="242.htm">Sections 5.6</a> and <a href="267.htm">5.8</a>). 
</p>
<p>High-latitude warming that has occurred in the Arctic region since the 1960s 
  (Chapman and Walsh, 1993; Serreze et al., 2000) is consistent with simulations 
  of climate models that predict increased greenhouse forcing (Kattenberg et al., 
  1996). Climatic change has been regionally variable, with cooling in northeastern 
  North America and warming in northwestern North America and northern Siberia. 
  The warming results from a change in the frequency of circulation modes rather 
  than gradual warming (Palmer, 1999). Precipitation (P) and surface evaporation 
  (E) have increased at high latitudes, with no significant temporal trend in 
  the balance between the two (P-E) (Serreze et al., 2000). </p>
<p>Permafrost underlies 20-25% of the northern hemisphere land area (Brown 
  et al., 1997a). Ice that forms during periods of cold climate frequently constitutes 
  a high proportion (20-30%) of the volume of these frozen soils (Brown et 
  al., 1997a). Consequently, melting of permafrost can lead to surface collapse 
  of soils forming thermokarst, an irregular topography of mounds, pits, troughs, 
  and depressions that may or may not be filled with water, depending on topography. 
  Permafrost temperatures have warmed in western North America by 2-4&deg;C 
  from 1940 to 1980 (Lachenbruch and Marshall, 1986) and in Siberia by 0.6-0.7&deg;C 
  from 1970 to 1990 (Pavlov, 1994), whereas permafrost cooled in northeastern 
  Canada (Wang and Allard, 1995)&#151;patterns that roughly parallel recent trends 
  in air temperature. However, the magnitude of warming and patterns of interannual 
  variation (roughly 10-year oscillations) in permafrost temperatures are not 
  readily explained as a simple response to regional warming (Osterkamp et al., 
  1994). Changes in permafrost regime probably reflect undocumented changes in 
  the thickness or thermal conductance of snow or vegetation, in addition to changes 
  in air temperature (Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999). Thermokarst features are 
  developing actively in the zone of discontinuous permafrost (Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 
  1999), particularly in association with fire and human disturbance, but there 
  are no long-term records from which to detect trends in the regional frequency 
  of thermokarst.</p>
<p>In contrast to the long-term trend in tundra carbon accumulation during the 
  Holocene, flux measurements in Alaska suggest that recent warming may have converted 
  tundra from a net carbon sink to a source of as much as 0.7 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  (Oechel et al., 1993; Oechel and Vourlitis, 1994). The direction and magnitude 
  of the response of carbon exchange to warming may be regionally variable, depending 
  on climate, topography, and disturbance regime (Zimov et al., 1999, McGuire 
  et al., 2000). During recent decades, peak-to-trough amplitude in the seasonal 
  cycle of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations has increased, and the phase 
  has advanced at arctic and subarctic CO<sub>2</sub> observation stations north 
  of 55&deg;N (Keeling et al., 1996). This change in carbon dynamics in the atmosphere 
  probably reflects some combination of increased uptake during the first half 
  of the growing season (Randerson et al., 1999), increased winter efflux (Chapin 
  et al., 1996), and increased seasonality of carbon exchange associated with 
  disturbance (Zimov et al., 1999). This "inverse" approach generally 
  has concluded that mid-northern latitudes were a net carbon sink during the 
  1980s and early 1990s (Tans et al., 1990; Ciais et al., 1995; Fan et al., 1998; 
  Bousquet et al., 1999; Rayner et al., 1999). At high northern latitudes, these 
  models give a wider range of estimates, with some analyses pointing to a net 
  source (Ciais et al., 1995; Fan et al., 1998) and others to a sink (Bousquet 
  et al., 1999; Rayner et al., 1999). </p>
<p>High-latitude wetlands and lakes account for 5-10% of global CH<sub>4</sub> 
  fluxes to the atmosphere (Reeburgh and Whalen, 1992). These fluxes increase 
  dramatically with thermokarst (Zimov et al., 1997), acting as a potentially 
  important positive feedback to global warming.</p>
<p>Satellite imagery suggests an increase in NDVI (a measure of "greenness") 
  from 1981 to 1991 (Myneni et al., 1997), although interpretation is complicated 
  by changes in sensor calibration (Fung, 1997). If these changes in satellite 
  imagery are an accurate reflection of vegetation activity, changes in NDVI could 
  help explain the increase in seasonal amplitude in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> observed 
  at high northern latitudes (Keeling et al., 1996; Randerson et al., 1999). This 
  also is consistent with the increased biomass of shrubs in the arctic tundra 
  (Chapin et al., 1995). </p>
