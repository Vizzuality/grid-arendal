<h3><a name="4310"></a>4.3.10. Water Quality</h3>
<p>Water in rivers, aquifers, and lakes naturally contains many dissolved materials, 
  depending on atmospheric inputs, geological conditions, and climate. These materials 
  define the water&#146;s chemical characteristics. Its biological characteristics 
  are defined by the flora and fauna within the water body, and temperature, sediment 
  load, and color are important physical characteristics. Water &#147;quality&#148; 
  is a function of chemical, physical, and biological characteristics but is a 
  value-laden term because it implies quality in relation to some standard. Different 
  uses of water have different standards. Pollution can be broadly defined as 
  deterioration of some aspect of the chemical, physical, or biological characteristics 
  of water (its &#147;quality&#148;) to such an extent that it impacts some use 
  of that water or ecosystems within the water. Major water pollutants include 
  organic material, which causes oxygen deficiency in water bodies; nutrients, 
  which cause excessive growth of algae in lakes and coastal areas&#151;known 
  as eutrophication (leading to algal blooms, which may be toxic and consume large 
  amounts of oxygen when decaying); and toxic heavy metals and organic compounds. 
  The severity of water pollution is governed by the intensity of pollutants and 
  the assimilation capacity of receiving water bodies&#151;which depends on the 
  physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of streamflow&#151; but not 
  all pollutants can be degraded, however. </p>
<p>Chemical river water quality is a function of the chemical load applied to 
  the river, water temperature, and the volume of flow. The load is determined 
  by catchment geological and land-use characteristics, as well as by human activities 
  in the catchment: Agriculture, industry, and public water use also may result 
  in the input of &#147;polluting&#148; substances. Agricultural inputs are most 
  likely to be affected by climate change because a changing climate might alter 
  agricultural practices. A changing climate also may alter chemical processes 
  in the soil, including chemical weathering (White and Blum, 1995). Avila et 
  al. (1996) simulated a substantial increase in base cation weathering rates 
  in Spain when temperature and precipitation increased (although if precipitation 
  were reduced, the effects of the higher temperature were offset). This, in turn, 
  resulted in an increase in concentrations of base cations such as calcium, sodium, 
  and potassium and an increase in streamwater alkalinity. Warmer, drier conditions, 
  for example, promote mineralization of organic nitrogen (Murdoch et al., 2000) 
  and thus increase the potential supply to the river or groundwater. Load also 
  is influenced by the processes by which water reaches the river channel. Nitrates, 
  for example, frequently are flushed into rivers in intense storms following 
  prolonged dry periods. </p>
<p>River water temperature depends not only on atmospheric temperature but also 
  on wind and solar radiation (Orlob et al., 1996). River water temperature will 
  increase by a slightly lesser amount than air temperature (Pilgrim et al., 1998), 
  with the smallest increases in catchments with large contributions from groundwater. 
  Biological and chemical processes in river water are dependent on water temperature: 
  Higher temperatures alone would lead to increases in concentrations of some 
  chemical species but decreases in others. Dissolved oxygen concentrations are 
  lower in warmer water, and higher temperatures also would encourage the growth 
  of algal blooms, which consume oxygen on decomposition. </p>
<p>Streamwater quality, however, also will be affected by streamflow volumes, 
  affecting both concentrations and total loads. Carmichael et al. (1996), for 
  example, show how higher temperatures and lower summer flows could combine in 
  the Nitra River, Slovakia, to produce substantial reductions in dissolved oxygen 
  concentrations. Research in Finland (Frisk et al., 1997; Kallio et al., 1997) 
  indicates that changes in stream water quality, in terms of eutrophication and 
  nutrient transport, are very dependent on changes in streamflow. For a given 
  level of inputs, a reduction in streamflow might lead to increases in peak concentrations 
  of certain chemical compounds. Cruise et al. (1999) simulated increased concentrations 
  of nitrate in the southeast United States, for example, but the total amount 
  transported from a catchment might decrease. Hanratty and Stefan (1998) simulated 
  reductions in nitrate and phosphate loads in a small Minnesota catchment, largely 
  as a result of reductions in runoff. Alexander et al. (1996) suggest that nutrient 
  loadings to receiving coastal zones would vary primarily with streamflow volume. 
  Increased streamflow draining toward the Atlantic coast of the United States 
  under many scenarios, for example, would lead to increased nutrient loadings. 
  An increased frequency of heavy rainfall would adversely affect water quality 
  by increasing pollutant loads flushed into rivers and possibly by causing overflows 
  of sewers and waste storage facilities. Polluting material also may be washed 
  into rivers and lakes following inundation of waste sites and other facilities 
  located on floodplains.</p>
<p>Water temperature in lakes responds to climate change in more complicated ways 
  because thermal stratification is formed in summer, as well as in colder regions 
  in winter. Meyer et al. (1999) evaluated the effect of climate change on thermal 
  stratification by simulation for hypothetical lakes. They show that lakes in 
  subtropic zones (about latitude 30 to 45&deg;) and in subpolar zones (latitude 
  65 to 80&deg;) are subject to greater relative changes in thermal stratification 
  patterns than mid-latitude or equatorial lakes and that deep lakes are more 
  sensitive than shallow lakes in the subtropic zones. Hostetler and Small (1999) 
  simulated potential impacts on hypothetical shallow and deep lakes across North 
  America, showing widespread increases in lake water temperature slightly below 
  the increase in air temperature in the scenarios used. The greatest increases 
  were in lakes that were simulated to experience substantial reductions in the 
  duration of ice cover; the boundary of ice-free conditions shifted northward 
  by 10&deg; of latitude or more (1,000 km). Fang and Stefan (1997) show by simulation 
  that winter stratification in cold regions would be weakened and the anoxic 
  zone would disappear. Observations during droughts in the boreal region of northwestern 
  Ontario show that lower inflows and higher temperatures produce a deepening 
  of the thermocline (Schindler et al., 1996).</p>
<p>The consequences of these direct changes to water quality of polluted water 
  bodies may be profound, as summarized by Varis and Somlyody (1996) for lakes. 
  Increases in temperature would deteriorate water quality in most polluted water 
  bodies by increasing oxygen-consuming biological activities and decreasing the 
  saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen. Hassan et al. (1998a,b) employed 
  a downscaled climate model combined with GCM output to predict future stratification 
  for Suwa Lake, Japan, on a daily basis, as well as for the prolonged summer 
  stratification period. They predict increased growth of phytoplankton and reduced 
  dissolved oxygen concentrations at different depths in the lake. Analysis of 
  past observations in Lake Biwa in Japan (Fushimi, 1999) suggests that dissolved 
  oxygen concentrations also tend to reduce when air (and lake water) temperature 
  is higher.</p>
<p>Water quality in many rivers, lakes, and aquifers, however, is heavily dependent 
  on direct and indirect human activities. Land-use and agricultural practices 
  have a very significant effect on water quality, as do management actions to 
  control point and nonpoint source pollution and treat wastewaters discharged 
  into the environment. In such water bodies, future water quality will be very 
  dependent on future human activities, including water management policies, and 
  the direct effect of climate change may be very small in relative terms (Hanratty 
  and Stefan, 1998). Considerable effort is being expended in developed and developing 
  countries to improve water quality (<a href="179.htm">Sections 4.5</a> and <a href="186.htm">4.6</a>), 
  and these efforts will have very significant implications for the impact of 
  climate change on water quality.</p>
<p>Confidence in estimates of change in water quality is determined partly by 
  climate change scenarios (and their effects on streamflow), but additional uncertainty 
  is added by current lack of detailed understanding of some of the process interactions 
  involved.</p>
