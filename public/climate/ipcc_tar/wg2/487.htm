<h2>12.9. Synthesis</h2>
<a name="1291"></a> 
<h3>12.9.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Many activities and ecosystems in Australia and New Zealand are sensitive to 
  climate change, with positive and negative effects. Much climate sensitivity 
  information is still qualitative, and there are substantial uncertainties in 
  predictions of regional- to local-scale climate changes&#151;especially rainfall 
  changes and changes in extreme events. Thus, comprehensive, quantitatively based 
  cross-sectoral estimates of net Australasian costs of climate change impacts 
  are not yet available. Confidence remains very low in the impact estimate for 
  Australia and New Zealand of -1.2 to -3.8% of GDP for an equivalent 
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Basher et al., 1998). This estimate 
  is based on climate change scenarios that are now outdated; does not include 
  some potentially important impacts, including changes in weeds, pests and diseases, 
  storm surges, and urban flooding; and does not account for possible adaptations 
  to climate change.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, there is a large body of knowledge and more agreement 
  on changes than often is realized (e.g., between different coupled ocean-atmosphere 
  climate models on the sign of the change in rainfall over large areas of Australia; 
  see <a href="467.htm#12151">Section 12.1.5.1</a>). There also is qualitative 
  agreement on reduced water supplies in large agricultural regions of Australia 
  (see <a href="470.htm#1231">Sections 12.3.1</a> and <a href="477.htm#1256">12.5.6</a>).</p>
<p>Potential net impacts on grazing, crops, and forests critically depend on the 
  balance between the competing effects of warmings, positive or negative rainfall 
  changes, direct physiological effects of higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, 
  and spatial and temporal variations in soil fertility. We expect with medium 
  to high confidence that beneficial physiological effects of higher CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration will become less dominant with time and effects of warming will 
  become more damaging, especially given the expected tendency toward greater 
  aridity over much of Australia. Impacts (and thus climate change benefits or 
  damages) will not scale linearly with increasing GHG concentrations.</p>
<p>The following subsections draw together material from this chapter that is 
  pertinent to the "policy-relevant questions" identified by the IPCC 
  Bureau, as well as regional policy concerns.</p>
<a name="1292"></a> 
<h3>12.9.2. Observed Consequences of Past and Current Climate Variability in the 
  Region</h3>
<p>Regional consequences documented in this chapter from floods, droughts, and 
  temperature changes associated with recent ENSO events include losses in the 
  pastoral agriculture sector from droughts (Australia, 1-2% of GDP; New 
  Zealand, NZ$422 million estimated farm-gate costs from 1997 to 1999) and impacts 
  on streamflow, water supply, stream ecology, horticulture, some commercial fisheries, 
  and toxic algal blooms. Parts of the GBR have suffered mass coral bleaching 
  from high SSTs (possibly related to ENSO and recent warming trends) and/or lowered 
  salinity as a result of floods. Storms in the New Zealand region may have been 
  more frequent in past warm epochs, leading to a greater influx of terrigenous 
  material onto the continental shelf. Oceanic productivity east of New Zealand 
  apparently increased immediately prior to and during warm periods 6,000-7,000 
  years ago and 120,000-125,000 years ago. </p>
<p>Extreme climatic events resulting from natural climatic variability in the 
  past century have caused major damage and loss of life in Australia and New 
  Zealand (see <a href="468.htm#12153">Sections 12.1.5.3</a> and <a href="480.htm#1262">12.6.2</a>). 
  These extremes are expected to change in intensity, location-specific frequency, 
  and sequence as a result of climate change (see <a href="154.htm#tab310">Table 
  3-10</a> and Section <a href="468.htm#12153">12.1.5.3</a>), with major impacts 
  on infrastructure and society unless strong adaptation measures are adopted.</p>
<a name="1293"></a> 
<h3>12.9.3. Factors Influencing Vulnerability</h3>
<a name="12931"></a>
<h4>12.9.3.1. Abrupt or Nonlinear Changes in Impacts</h4>
<p>Several potential abrupt or nonlinear responses to climate change are listed 
  in <a href="#tab121">Table 12-1</a>. In some cases, they involve a reversal of the sign of the effect 
  with greater climate change; in others they result from the onset or acceleration 
  of a biophysical or socioeconomic process that occurs or greatly accelerates 
  beyond some threshold of climate change. Such thresholds can be quite location- 
  and system-specific and need to be identified in collaboration between climatologists 
  and stakeholders. The frequency with which thresholds are exceeded often is 
  used in engineering in the form of design criteria to withstand an event with 
  a certain "return period," or average time between occurrences. It 
  also can manifest itself as a change from an average profit to an average loss 
  for a given enterprise such as a farm.</p>

<h4>12.9.3.2. Interactions with Other Environmental and Social Factors</h4>
<p>Some of the region's ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to invasion by exotic 
  animal and plant species because of relative isolation before European settlement. 
  Land-use changes have left some systems and areas more vulnerable to added stresses 
  from climate changes, as a result of salinization or erosion, and because of 
  ecosystem fragmentation, which lessens adaptation options for movement of species 
  threatened by changing habitats (see <a href="473.htm#1248">Section 12.4.8</a>). 
</p>
<p>Increasing human populations and development in coastal areas and on floodplains 
  cause increasing vulnerability to tropical cyclones, storm surges, and riverine 
  flooding episodes (see <a href="473.htm#1247">Sections 12.4.7</a> and <a href="480.htm#1264">12.6.4</a>), 
  which may become more frequent with climatic change. Development has reduced 
  the area and water quality of many estuaries, increasing the vulnerability of 
  their ecosystems to sea-level rise and climate changes. Pressures on coral reefs 
  including the GBR include increased coastal development, fisheries, tourism, 
  and runoff of nutrients, chemicals, and sediment from land, as well as climate-related 
  stresses such as rising sea level, rising temperatures, changes in tropical 
  storm frequency, and acidification of the ocean from increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations (see <a href="473.htm#1247">Section 12.4.7</a>).</p>
<p>Poorer communities, including many indigenous settlements, are more vulnerable 
  to climate-related natural hazards and stresses on health (see <a href="483.htm#1276">Section 
  12.7.6</a>) because they often are in exposed areas and have less adequate housing, 
  health, and other resources for adaptation.</p>
<p>Capacity to adapt is a function not only of the magnitude and critical nature 
  of the climatic change but also of the demographics, economy, institutional 
  capacity, and technology of a society. Thus, alternative socioeconomic futures 
  will lead to different capacities to adapt. This has hardly been explored to 
  date in Australia and New Zealand in relation to climate change.</p>
<a name="12933"></a>
<h4>12.9.3.3. Regional-Global Interactions</h4>
<p>Reliance on exports of agricultural and forest products makes the region sensitive 
  to changes in commodity prices produced by changes in climate elsewhere (see 
  <a href="478.htm#1259">Section 12.5.9</a>) and to increases in global forests 
  as a result of carbon sink policies. Other extra-regional factors include increased 
  risks of invasion by exotic pests, weeds, and diseases; pressures from immigration 
  from neighboring low-lying Pacific island territories impacted by sea-level 
  rise (see <a href="483.htm#1276">Section 12.7.6</a>); and international agreements 
  that constrain net emissions of GHGs. In an era of increasing globalization, 
  these issues may assume more importance, although this report hardly touches 
  on them.</p>
