<h2>13.4. Synthesis </h2>
<h3><a name="1341"></a>13.4.1. Key Impacts </h3>
<p>Two important messages emerge from this review: </p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Potential impacts on key resources (land, ecosystems, and particularly 
    water) are significant. 
  <li> Even in prosperous Europe, adverse climate change impacts may aggravate 
    equity issues. 
</ul>
<p>Climate change in Europe will involve losses and gains to the natural resource 
  base; in some cases, these changes have begun. These impacts will vary substantially 
  from region to region (they will be particularly adverse in the south) and within 
  regions, from sector to sector as well as within sectors. The significance of 
  these effects, however, will depend to a considerable extent on nonclimatic 
  drivers of environmental change, socioeconomic development, and policy evolution 
  within Europe. The most significant impacts (and opportunities) that will require 
  greatest attention with respect to policies of response may be summarized in 
  general terms as follows (a fuller precis appears in the Executive Summary at 
  the beginning of this chapter). Climate changes as characterized by the scenarios 
  described in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a> of this report, if not adequately 
  responded to through effective adaptation and policy development, would lead 
  in Europe to: </p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Increased pressures on water resources, particularly in the south 
  <li> Aggravated flood hazard 
  <li> Deterioration in soil quality 
  <li> Altered natural eosystems, with loss of some habitats and potential loss 
    of species 
  <li> Increased productivity of northern commercial forests but reductions in 
    the south 
  <li> Increased forest fire risk 
  <li> Positive effects on agriculture in the north but broadly negative effects 
    in the south 
  <li> Altered fisheries potential 
  <li> Increased property damage 
  <li> Relatively minor effects on the transport, energy, and manufacturing sectors, 
    some of which may be positive (though substantial effects may derive from 
    policies of mitigation that are necessary to reduce impacts elsewhere) 
  <li> Changing tourist potential 
  <li> A range of human health implications 
  <li> Increased risk of flooding, erosion, wetland loss, and degradation in coastal 
    zones 
  <li> Upward shift of biotic zones and snowlines in mountain regions. 
</ul>
<p>In general, more adverse effects may be expected to occur in regions of Europe 
  that are economically less developed because adaptive capacity will be less 
  developed there. These areas would include more marginal areas of the EU and 
  regions outside the EU such as the Balkans. </p>
