<h4><a name="152313"></a>15.2.3.1.3. Response to climate variability and extreme events</h4>
<p>The effects of changes in the variability of temperatures and precipitation 
  on crop yields have been evaluated through simulation modeling. Changes in diurnal 
  and interannual variability of temperature and moisture can result in substantial 
  changes in the mean and variability of wheat yields. In Kansas, doubling of 
  temperature variability resulted in greatly reduced average yield and increased 
  variability of yield, primarily as a result of crop failure by winterkill (Mearns 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996). The main risk of climate change to some regions may be 
  primarily from the potential for increased variability. Increased variability 
  of temperature and precipitation results in substantially lower mean simulated 
  yields, whereas decreased variability produces only small increases in yield 
  that were insignificant (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 2000). This asymmetric response 
  to temperature variability underscores a major reason that the corn belt region 
  of the United States is so productive: There generally is low variability in 
  temperature across the region. It should be noted, therefore, that if minimum 
  temperatures increase more than maximums, two outcomes could be suggested: Temperature 
  variability may decline, and winterkill should be reduced.<br>
</p>
<p>These effects of diurnal and interannual climate variation may have important 
  implications for farm values. Economic analysis has shown that greater interannual 
  variation is harmful to farm values, and the marginal effect of temperature 
  variation is relatively larger than the effect of variations in precipitation 
  (Mendelsohn <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>

        <p><b>Box 15-1. Carbon Sequestration: Adaptation Issues</b></p>
        <p align="left">The Kyoto Protocol commits industrialized nations to take 
          on binding targets for GHG emissions for the period 2008-2012. 
          The Protocol mentions human-induced land-use changes and forestry activities 
          (afforestation, reforestation, deforestation) as sinks of GHGs for which 
          sequestration credits can be claimed; it also mentions that agricultural 
          sinks may be considered in the future. As a result, a significant market 
          is emerging in North America for ways to enhance carbon sequestration 
          in these sectors. Although it is not within the purview of this section 
          to deal with mitigation strategies, land management decisions impact 
          a wide range of factors. There may be several consequent issues that 
          result or are derived from implementation and adoption of these strategies. 
          Negative consequences of reduced tillage implemented to enhance soil 
          carbon sequestration may include (medium confidence):<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> Increased use of pesticides for disease, insect, and weed management. 
          This increased pesticide load may affect adjacent ecosystems and the 
          quality of water within and outside agroecosystems.</li>
        <li>Capture of carbon in labile forms that are vulnerable to rapid oxidation 
          if the system is changed. This may require that reduced-till systems 
          be maintained for an extended period (which also would lengthen the 
          beneficial aspects of reduced tillage).</li>
        <li>Reduced yields and cropping management options and increased risk 
          for farmers (Would yield reductions and increased risk be compensated?). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beneficial consequences of reduced tillage (especially no-till) may include 
        (high confidence):<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced input costs (e.g., fuel) for farmers, thereby increasing the 
          economic profit margin</li>
        <li>Increased soil moisture and hence reductions in crop water stress 
          in dry areas</li>
        <li>Reduction in soil erosion, which inhibits loss of carbon from erosional 
          forces and preserves the natural land base</li>
        <li>The overall combination of these effects improves soil quality and 
          the ability of soils to physically and chemically support plant growth, 
          as well as conserving the continent's natural resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The extent to which carbon will be sequestered in agricultural and forest 
        systems will be related to practical economics and land-use policies. 
        For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expansion of agricultural lands for carbon sequestration may increase 
          competition with use of agricultural lands for traditional food and 
          fiber production. The effect may be decreased food and fiber production, 
          with subsequent increases in prices and decreases in exports for agricultural 
          commodities.</li>
        <li>Land prices may change (e.g., increase) as a consequence of competition 
          between crops for food and crops for mitigation strategies.</li>
        <li>Reduction of agricultural lands by transferring these lands to forestry 
          to enhance carbon sequestration also may increase competition for food 
          and fiber production, but the influx of land into forestry subsequently 
          may decrease forestry prices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, a focus on carbon sequestration in ecosystems may result in the 
        transfer of large quantities of land between agriculture and forestry 
        and change the management of existing agricultural and forest ecosystems. 
        These changes may provide opportunities for landowners, but they also 
        may have implications for food and fiber production and ecosystem functions.

<h4><a name="152314"></a>15.2.3.1.4. Vulnerability of livestock<br>
</h4>
<p>The effects of climate change on livestock can be direct (e.g., effects of 
  higher temperature on livestock appetite) or indirect (e.g., effects of changes 
  in quantity and quality of forage from grasslands and supplies of feed). In 
  areas where livestock rely on surface water availability, water quality could 
  have an impact on weight gain. This would be particularly important where fewer 
  water sources become used by greater numbers of cattle. <br>
</p>
<p>Estimates of livestock production efficiency suggest that the negative effects 
  of hotter weather in summer outweigh the positive effects of warmer winters 
  (Adams <i>et al</i>., 1999). The largest change occurred under a 5&deg;C increase 
  in temperature, when livestock yields fell by 10% in cow-calf and dairy operations 
  in the Appalachia, southeast, Delta, and southern Plains regions of the United 
  States. The smallest change was 1% under 1.5&deg;C warming in the same regions. 
  Livestock production also is affected by changes in temperature and extreme 
  events. For example, an ice storm in eastern Canada and the northeast United 
  States in the winter of 1998 had severe effects on livestock in the region (see 
  <a href="585.htm#15326">Section 15.3.2.6</a>).</p>
