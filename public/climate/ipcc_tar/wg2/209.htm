        <p><b>Box 5-4. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Impacts on Crop<br>
          Productivity: Recent Estimates with Field-<br>
          Grown Crops under FACE Experimentation</b></p>
        <p align="left">The short-term responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> of 
          plants grown in artificial conditions are notoriously difficult to extrapolate 
          to crops in the field (K&ouml;rner, 1995a). Moreover, with field-grown 
          plants, enclosures tend to modify the plant's environment (Kimball 
          et al., 1997). However, even the most realistic free-air CO<sub>2</sub> 
          enrichment (FACE) experiments undertaken to date create a modified area 
          (Kimball et al., 1993), analogous to a single irrigated field in a dry 
          environment, and impose an abrupt change in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. 
          A cotton crop exposed to FACE increased biomass and harvestable yield 
          by 37 and 48%, respectively, in elevated (550 ppm) CO<sub>2</sub>. This 
          effect was attributed to increased early leaf area, more profuse flowering, 
          and a longer period of fruit retention (Mauney et al., 1994). At 550 
          ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, spring wheat increased grain yields by 8-10% 
          under well-watered conditions (Pinter et al., 1996). More recent studies 
          with optimal nitrogen and irrigation increased final grain yield by 
          15 and 16% for two growing seasons at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
          (550 ppm), compared with control treatments (Pinter et al., 1996). If 
          these latter results are linearly extrapolated to the possible effect 
          of a doubling (700 ppm) of the current atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, 
          yields under ideal conditions would be 28% greater&#151;in agreement 
          with previous statements by Reilly et al. (1996). In grass-clover mixtures, 
          the proportion of legume increased significantly under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
          (Hebeisen et al.,1997)&#151;a conclusion also reached by several experimental 
          studies with temperate and fertile managed grasslands (Newton et al., 
          1996; Soussana and Hartwig, 1996; Stewart and Potvin, 1996).</p>

<h4><a name="box54"></a>5.3.2.1. Degradation of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>Degradation of natural resources&#151;taken here as soils, forests, marine 
  fisheries, air, and water&#151;diminishes agricultural production capacity (Pinstrup-Andersen 
  and Pandya-Lorch, 1998). Soil degradation emerges as one of the major challenges 
  for global agriculture. It is induced via erosion, chemical depletion, water 
  saturation, and solute accumulation. In the post-World War II period, approximately 
  23% of the world's agricultural land, permanent pastures, forests, and 
  woodland were degraded as defined by the United Nations Environment Programme 
  (UNEP) (Oldeman et al., 1991). Various estimates put the annual loss of land 
  at 5-10 Mha yr<sup>-1</sup> (Scherr and Yadav, 1997). Although irrigated 
  land accounts for only 16% of the world's cropland, it produces 40% of 
  the world's food. There are signs of a slowing in the rate of expansion 
  of irrigation: 10-15% of irrigated land is degraded to some extent by waterlogging 
  and salinization (Alexandratos, 1995). Degradation of natural resources is likely 
  to hinder increases in agricultural productivity and could dim optimistic assessments 
  of the prospects of satisfying growing world food demand at acceptable environmental 
  cost.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5322"></a>5.3.2.2. Other Global Change Factors </h4>
<p>Regional scenarios of seasonal temperature and precipitation change for 32 
  world regions analyzed in <a href="122.htm">Chapter 3</a> show the current variability 
  of climate and the range of changes predicted by GCMs for 30-year time periods 
  centered on 2025, 2055, and 2085. This background information is essential to 
  interpret the potential impacts of climate change on crops and livestock production. 
  Equally important background information is provided by agroclimatic indices. 
  Agroclimatic indices are useful in conveying climate variability and change 
  in terms that are meaningful to agriculture. They give a first approximation 
  of the potential effects of climate change on agricultural production and should 
  continue to be used (Sirotenko et al., 1995; Sirotenko and Abashina, 1998; Menzhulin, 
  1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Several other climate-related global environmental changes are likely to affect 
  the agriculture sector in coming years. Reilly et al. (1996) reviewed the exposure 
  of crops to tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Progress in sorting out interactions 
  between O<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and climate variability is reviewed below. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to interact with other global changes, including population 
  growth and migration, economic growth, urbanization, and changes in land use 
  and resource degradation. D&ouml;&ouml;s and Shaw (1999) use an accounting system 
  to estimate the sensitivity of agricultural production to various aspects of 
  global change, including loss of cropland from soil degradation and urbanization. 
  Imhoff et al. (1997) use remote-sensing techniques and soils data to show that 
  urbanization in the United States has occurred primarily on high-quality agricultural 
  lands.</p>

  and Fiber</h3>
<h4><a name="5331"></a>5.3.3.1. Interaction between Rising CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations 
  and Climate Change</h4>
<p>Advances in knowledge of CO<sub>2</sub> effects on crop and forage plants establish 
  convincingly, although incompletely, that it is no longer useful to examine 
  the impacts of climate change absent their interactions with rising atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> (see Boxes <a href="208.htm#box53">5-3</a> and <a href="#box54">5-4</a>). 
  Crop and forage plants are likely to be forced to deal with the combined effects 
  of climate change and rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In this 
  section, emphasis is placed on understanding basic interactions between plant 
  productivity, climate change, and rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The 
  direct effects of climate change on livestock also are considered. </p>
<h4><a name="53311"></a>5.3.3.1.1. Interactive effects of temperature increase 
  and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration</h4>
<p>Because temperature increase enhances photorespiration in C<sub>3</sub> species 
  (Long, 1991), the positive effects of CO<sub>2 </sub>enrichment on photosynthetic 
  productivity usually are greater when temperature rises (Bowes et al., 1996; 
  Casella et al., 1996). A rise in mean global nighttime temperatures (Horton, 
  1995) could enhance carbon losses from crops by stimulating shoot dark respiration 
  (Amthor, 1997). Despite possible short-term effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  on dark respiration (Amthor, 1997; Drake et al., 1997), the long-term ratio 
  of shoot dark respiration to photosynthesis is approximately constant with respect 
  to air temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Gifford, 1995; Casella 
  and Soussana, 1997). With moderate temperatures, long-term doubling of current 
  ambient CO<sub>2</sub> under field-like conditions leads to a 30% enhancement 
  in the seed yield of rice, despite a 5-10% decline in the number of days 
  to heading (Horie et al., 2000). The grain yield of CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched 
  rice shows about a 10% decline for each 1&deg;C rise above 26&deg;C. This decline 
  is caused by a shortening of growth duration and increased spikelet sterility. 
  Similar scenarios have been reported for soybean and wheat (Mitchell et al., 
  1993; Bowes et al., 1996). With rice, the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
  on yield may even become negative at extremely high temperatures (above 36.5 
  &deg;C) during flowering (Horie et al., 2000). However, in some cropping systems 
  with growth in the cooler months, increased rates of phenological development 
  with warm temperatures and/or earlier planting dates may tend to move the grain 
  fill period earlier into the year during the cooler months, offsetting at least 
  part of the deleterious effects of higher temperatures (Howden et al., 1999a).</p>
