<h2>12.8. Adaptation Potential and Vulnerability</h2>
<a name="1281"></a> 
<h3>12.8.1. Adaptation and Possible Benefits of Climate Change</h3>
<p>It has not been assumed that all the impacts of climate change will be detrimental. 
  Indeed, several studies have looked at possible benefits. Moreover, adaptation 
  is a means of maximizing such gains as well as minimizing potential losses.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that potential gains have not been well documented, 
  in part because of lack of stakeholder concern in such cases and consequent 
  lack of special funding. Examples that have not been fully documented include 
  the possible spread of tropical and subtropical horticulture further poleward 
  (but see some New Zealand studies, on kiwi fruit, for example&#151;Salinger 
  and Kenny, 1995; Hall and McPherson, 1997b). In southern parts of Australia 
  and New Zealand, notably Tasmania, there could be gains for the wine industry, 
  increased comfort indices and thus tourism, and in some scenarios increased 
  water for hydroelectric power generation.</p>
<p>Guest <i>et al.</i> (1999) have documented possible decreases in winter human 
  mortality alongside possible increased summer mortality (see <a href="481.htm#1271">Section 
  12.7.1</a>), and Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) have shown that Australian wheat 
  yields may increase for 1 or 2&deg;C warming, before showing declines at greater 
  warmings (see <a href="475.htm#1253">Section 12.5.3</a> and <a href="475.htm#fig12-3">Figure 
  12-3</a>). A similar situation may apply to forestry (see <a href="476.htm#1254">Section 
  12.5.4</a>). Such studies take account of gains from increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations. Changes in overseas production and thus in markets in some cases 
  also could lead to greater demand and higher prices for Australian and New Zealand 
  primary products (see <a href="478.htm#1259">Section 12.5.9</a>), but only if 
  such changes do not disrupt world trade in other ways (e.g., lower capacity 
  to pay).</p>
<p>Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change must be considered in the context 
  of the entire ecological and socioeconomic environment in which they will take 
  place. Indeed, adaptations will be viable only if they have net social and economic 
  benefits and are taken up by stakeholders. Adaptations should take account of 
  any negative side effects, which would not only detract from their purpose but 
  might lead to opposition to their implementation (PMSEIC, 1999).</p>
<p>Adaptation is the primary means for maximizing gains and minimizing losses. 
  This is why it is important to include adaptation in impact and vulnerability 
  studies, as well as in policy options. As discussed in <a href="641.htm">Chapter 
  18</a>, adaptation is necessary to help cope with inevitable climate change, 
  but it has limits; therefore, it would be unwise to rely solely on adaptation 
  to solve the climate change problem. </p>
<p>In some cases adaptation may have co-benefits. For example, reforestation to 
  lower water tables and dryland salinization or to reduce storm runoff may provide 
  additional income and help with mitigation (reduction of GHG emissions). However, 
  other potential adaptations may be unattractive for other reasons (e.g., increased 
  setbacks of development in coastal and riverine environments). These considerations 
  have particular application in Australia and New Zealand. Studies of adaptation 
  to climate change in Australia and New Zealand are still relatively few and 
  far between. They are summarized in the remainder of this section.</p>
<a name="1282"></a> 
<h3>12.8.2. Integrated Assessments and Thresholds</h3>
<p>Over the past decade there have been several national and regional assessments 
  of the possible impacts of climate change. A regional assessment for the Macquarie 
  River basin was done by Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i> (1998, reported 
  in Basher <i>et al.</i>, 1998); Howden <i>et al.</i> (1999d) made a national 
  assessment for terrestrial ecosystems (see <a href="474.htm#125">Section 12.5</a>). 
  Two other preliminary regional assessments cover the Hunter Valley in NSW (Hennessy 
  and Jones, 1999) and the Australian Capital Territory (Baker <i>et al.</i>, 
  2000). The former was based on a stakeholder assessment of climate change impacts 
  that identified heat stress in dairy cattle as a subject for a demonstration 
  risk assessment. Thresholds for heat stress and the probability of their being 
  exceeded were evaluated, as were the economic value of adaptation through installation 
  of shade and sprinklers (see <a href="474.htm#1252">Section 12.5.2</a>; Jones 
  and Hennessy, 2000). Baker <i>et al.</i> (2000) made a preliminary qualitative 
  assessment of the impacts of scenarios on the basis of the CSIRO RCM at 60-km 
  resolution (Hennessy <i>et al.</i>, 1998) on a wide range of sectors and activities.</p>
<p>However, most integrated studies in Australia and New Zealand have been "one-off" 
  assessments, have lacked a time dimension, cannot readily be repeated to take 
  account of advances in climate change science, and often have not placed the 
  problem in its socioeconomic context. Several groups are collaborating on integrated 
  modeling systems that overcome these drawbacks. In New Zealand this is called 
  CLIMPACTS (Kenny <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Warrick <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Kenny <i>et 
  al.</i>, 1999, 2000), and an Australian system called OZCLIM has been based 
  on it. These integrated models contain a climate change scenario generator, 
  climate and land surface data, and sectoral impact models. They provide a capacity 
  for time-dependent analyses, a flexible scenario approach, a capability for 
  rapid updating of scenarios; and inclusion of models for different sectors. 
  One application is reported in <a href="474.htm#1252">Section 12.5.2</a>.</p>
<p>OZCLIM contains regional climate patterns for monthly temperature and rainfall 
  over Australia from several GCMs and the CSIRO RCM. They can be forced or scaled 
  by the latest emission scenarios, and variables include potential evapotranspiration 
  and relative humidity. It is being adapted to produce projected ranges of impact 
  variables and to assess the risk of exceeding critical thresholds (CSIRO, 1996b; 
  Jones, 2000; Pittock and Jones, 2000). </p>
<p>There are different levels and styles of integration in impact and adaptation 
  assessment, and several of these have been attempted in Australia and New Zealand. 
  Bottom-up integration was done for a range of climate change scenarios in the 
  water supply, pasture, crop, and environmental flow sectors for the Macquarie 
  River basin study by Hassall and Associates <i>et al.</i> (1998). It also has been 
  done in a more probabilistic way to take account of uncertainty, with a focus 
  on the probability of exceeding a user-defined threshold for performance and 
  the need for adaptation (Jones, 2000). </p>
<p>Top-down integration has been attempted via the use of global impacts assessment 
  models with some regional disaggregation&#151;such as a regional analysis based 
  on the Carnegie Mellon University ICAM model, which was used to examine adaptation 
  strategies for the Australian agricultural sector (Graetz <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The 
  principal conclusions were that climate matters and that the best strategy is 
  to adapt better to climate variability. </p>
<p>Another top-down approach, based on an Australian regionalization of the DICE 
  model of Nordhaus (1994), is that of Islam (1995). An initial application of 
  this model to quantifying the economic impact of climate change damages on the 
  Australian economy gave only a small estimate, but the authors expressed reservations 
  about model assumptions and the need to better quantify climate impacts (Islam 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Others have examined the structure and behavior of the Integrated 
  Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) but to date have not applied this 
  to climate change impacts in Australia (Zapert <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Campolongo and 
  Braddock, 1999).</p>
<p>A spatially explicit modeling system known as INSIGHT is being developed to 
  evaluate a wide range of economic, social, environmental, and land-use impacts 
  that could affect large areas (Walker <i>et al.</i>, 1996). It can map and summarize 
  key social, economic, and environmental outcomes in annual steps to the year 
  2020. The need for such a system was identified through workshops involving 
  potential stakeholders, and the system could factor in scenarios resulting from 
  climate change.</p>
<p>As pointed out in PMSEIC (1999), much of Australia is subject to multiple environmental 
  problems, of which climate change is only one. This leads to a logical emphasis 
  on regional integrated assessments, which look for adaptations and policies 
  that help to ameliorate more than one problem and have economic benefits.</p>
