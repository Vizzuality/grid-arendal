<h3>2.6.1. Treatments of Uncertainties in Previous IPCC Assessments</h3>
<p>The IPCC function is to assess the state of our understanding and to judge 
  the confidence with which we can make projections of climate change and its 
  impacts. These tentative projections will aid policymakers in deciding on actions 
  to mitigate or adapt to anthropogenic climate change, which will need to be 
  re-assessed on a regular basis. It is recognized that many remaining uncertainties 
  need to be reduced in each of (many) disciplines, which is why IPCC projections 
  and scenarios are often expressed with upper and lower limits. These ranges 
  are based on the collective judgment of the IPCC authors and the reviewers of 
  each chapter, but it may be appropriate in the future to draw on formal methods 
  from the discipline of decision analysis to achieve more consistency in setting 
  criteria for high and low range limits (McBean <i>et al</i>., 1996; see Raiffa, 
  1968, for an introduction to decision analysis).</p>
<p>Although the SAR on impacts, adaptation, and mitigation (IPCC, 1996b) explicitly 
  links potentially serious climate change with mitigation and adaptation assessment 
  in its Technical Summary, the body of the report is restricted mostly to describing 
  sensitivity and vulnerability assessments (see also Carter <i>et al.</i>, 1994). 
  Although this methodology is appropriate for testing sensitivity and vulnerability 
  of systems, it is poorly suited for planning or policy purposes. IAMs available 
  to SAR authors (e.g., Weyant <i>et al</i>., 1996) generate outcomes that are 
  plausible but typically contain no information on the likelihood of outcomes 
  or much information on confidence in estimates of outcomes, how each result 
  fits into broader ranges of uncertainty, or what the ranges of uncertainty may 
  be for each outcome (see <a href="054.htm">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="090.htm">Section 
  2.4</a> for further discussions of integrated assessment issues). However, several 
  studies since the SAR do use probability distributions (e.g., Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 
  1996, and citations in Schneider, 1997).</p>
<p>IPCC Working Group I (WGI) in its contribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996a) uses 
  two different methods or techniques to estimate climate change: scenarios and 
  projections. A scenario is a description of a plausible future without estimation 
  of its likelihood (e.g. the individual IS92a-f emission scenarios or climate 
  scenarios generated by GCMs in which a single emission path is used). Scenarios 
  may contain several sources of uncertainty but generally do not acknowledge 
  them explicitly</p>
<p>Careful reading of the SAR WGI Technical Summary (IPCC, 1996a) reveals that 
  the term projection is used in two senses:</p>
<ol>
  <li> A single trajectory over time produced from one or more scenarios (e.g., 
    projected global temperature using the IS92a emissions scenario with a climate 
    sensitivity of 2.5&deg;C).</li>
  <li> A range of projections expressed at a particular time in the future, incorporating 
    one or more sources of uncertainty (e.g., projected global warming of 0.8-3.5&deg;C 
    by 2100, based on IS92a-f emission scenarios and a climate sensitivity of 
    1.5-4.5&deg;C at 2xCO<sub>2</sub>).</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Projections</i> are used instead of <i>predictions</i> to emphasize that 
  they do not represent attempts to forecast the most likely evolution of climate 
  in the future, only <i>possible</i> evolutions (IPCC, 1996a, Section F.1). In 
  the SAR, <i>projection</i> and <i>scenario</i> are used to describe possible 
  future states, with projections used mainly in terms of climate change and sea-level 
  rise. This usage defines climate projection as a <i>single</i> trajectory of 
  a subset of scenarios. When used as input into impact assessments, the same 
  climate projections commonly are referred to as climate scenarios.</p>

      range of uncertainty, which is drawn wider to represent overconfidence in 
      human judgments. M1 to M4 represent scenarios produced by four models (e.g., 
      globally averaged temperature increases from an equilibrium response to 
      doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations). This lies within a "full" 
      range of uncertainty that is not fully identified, much less directly quantified 
      by existing theoretical or empirical evidence (modified from Jones, 2000).</td>

<p><a name="fig21"></a>Projected <i>ranges</i> are constructed from two or more 
  scenarios in which one or more sources of uncertainty may be acknowledged. Examples 
  include projections of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> derived from the IS92a-f emission 
  scenarios (IPCC, 1996a), global temperature ranges (IPCC, 1996a), and regional 
  temperature ranges (CSIRO, 1996). A range of projections will always be more 
  likely to encompass what actually will transpire than a single scenario. Although 
  projected ranges are more likely to occur than single scenarios, they are not 
  full-fledged forecasts because they incorporate only part of the total uncertainty 
  space. The relationship between scenarios and projected ranges as treated in 
  the SAR is shown schematically in <a href="104.htm#fig21">Figure 2-1</a>.</p>
<p>A projected range is a quantifiable range of uncertainty situated within a 
  population of possible futures that cannot be fully identified (termed "knowable" 
  and "unknowable" uncertainties by Morgan and Henrion, 1990). The limits 
  of this total range of uncertainty are unknown but may be estimated subjectively 
  (e.g., Morgan and Keith, 1995). Given the finding in the cognitive psychology 
  literature that experts define subjective probability distributions too narrowly 
  because of overconfidence (see <a href="110.htm">Section 2.6.5.3</a>), the inner 
  range represents the "well-calibrated" range of uncertainty. Thus, 
  the wider range of uncertainty represents a "judged" range of uncertainty, 
  based on expert judgments&#151;which may not encompass the full range of uncertainty 
  given the possibility of cognitive biases such as overconfidence. Although the 
  general point remains that there is always a much wider uncertainty range than 
  the envelope developed by sets of existing model runs, it also is true that 
  there is no distinct line between "knowable" and "unknowable" 
  uncertainties; instead, it is a continuum. The actual situation depends on how 
  well our knowledge (and lack thereof) has been integrated into assessment models. 
  Moreover, new information&#151;particularly empirical data, if judged reliable 
  and comprehensive&#151;eventually may narrow the range of uncertainty to well 
  inside the well-calibrated range by falsifying certain outlier values. </p>
<p>If the full range of uncertainty in <a href="#fig21">Figure 2-1</a> were known, 
  the probability of a particular outcome could be expressed as a forecast (provided 
  we can state the probability). Although there are significant sources of uncertainty 
  that cannot yet be quantified, decision analytic elicitation procedures (<a href="090.htm">Section 
  2.4</a>) can estimate the full range of uncertainties and conditional probabilities 
  (see <a href="100.htm">Section 2.5.5</a> for an assessment of the state of the 
  science concerning human judgment). Conditional probabilities may be calculated 
  within a projected range even though the probability of the range itself remains 
  unknown.</p>
