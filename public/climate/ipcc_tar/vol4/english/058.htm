        vary from country to country and perhaps even from generation to generation. 
        This report therefore confirms the SAR finding that the value of better 
        information about climate change processes and impacts and society's 
        responses to them is likely to be great. Decisions about near-term climate 
        policies are in the process of being made while the concentration stabilization 
        target is still being debated. The literature suggests a step-by-step 
        resolution aimed at stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. This will 
        also involve balancing the risks of either insufficient or excessive action. 
        The relevant question is not "what is the best course for the next 
        100 years," but rather "what is the best course for the near 
        term given the expected long-term climate change and accompanying uncertainties."<br>

        emission reductions during the period 2008 to 2012 in Annex I countries 
        that are significantly stronger than the Kyoto Protocol commitments. This 
        analysis also suggests that achieving the aggregate Kyoto commitments 
        may be consistent with trajectories that achieve stabilization at 550 
        ppmv or higher. Other analyses suggest a more gradual departure from emissions 
        baselines even for 450 ppmv followed by sharper reductions in subsequent 
        budget periods. The path is influenced by the representation of inertia 
        in the system and expectations about how initial reductions by Annex I

            The challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue 
            of equity, namely the extent to which the impacts of climate change 
            or mitigation policies ameliorate or exacerbate inequities both within 
            and across nations and regions, and between generations. Findings 
            with respect to these different aspects of equity include: </p>

          <li> 
            <div align="left"><em>Equity within nations: Most studies show that 
              the distributional effects of a carbon tax are regressive unless 
              the tax revenues are used either directly or indirectly in favor 
              of the low-income groups; the regressive aspect can be totally or 
              partially compensated by a revenue-recycling policy. </em></div>

              </em>Another aspect of equity across nations and regions is that 
              mitigation of climate change can offset inequities that would be 
              exacerbated by the impacts of climate change (see <a href="047.htm">Question

              those with the fewest resources -- <br>

      carbon emissions over the period 1860-1998, and with cumulative carbon emissions 
      from a range of SRES scenarios and TAR stabilization scenarios until the 
      year 2100. </strong>Data for current reserves and resources are shown in 
      the lefthand columns. Unconventional oil and gas includes tar sands, shale 
      oil, other heavy oil, coal bed methane, deep geopressured gas, gas in aquifers, 
      etc. Gas hydrates (clathrates) that amount to an estimated 12,000 Gt C are 
      not shown. The scenario columns show both SRES reference scenarios as well 
      as scenarios that lead to stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
      at a range of levels. Note that if by the year 2100 cumulative emissions 
      associated with SRES scenarios are equal to or smaller than those for stabilization 
      scenarios, this does not imply that these scenarios equally lead to stabilization.<br>
