        likelihood of the projected changes is expected to increase with the rate, 
        magnitude, and duration of climate change. <br>
        <br>
        Examples of these types of changes include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li > Large climate-induced changes in soils and vegetation may be possible 
          and could induce further climate change through increased emissions 
          of greenhouse gases from plants and soil, and changes in surface properties 
          (e.g., albedo).</li>
        <li> Most models project a weakening of the thermohaline circulation of 
          the oceans resulting in a reduction of heat transport into high latitudes 
          of Europe, but none show an abrupt shutdown by the end of the 21st century. 
          However, beyond the year 2100, some models suggest that the thermohaline 
          circulation could completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut down in 
          either hemisphere if the change in radiative forcing is large enough 
          and applied long enough.</li>
        <li> The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to increase in mass during the 
          21st century, but after sustained warming the ice sheet could lose significant 
          mass and contribute several meters to the projected sea-level rise over 
          the next 1,000 years.</li>
        <li> In contrast to the Antarctic ice sheet, the Greenland ice sheet is 
          likely to lose mass during the 21st century and contribute a few cm 
          to sea-level rise. Ice sheets will continue to react to climate warming 
          and contribute to sea-level rise for thousands of years after climate 
          has been stabilized. Climate models indicate that the local warming 
          over Greenland is likely to be one to three times the global average. 
          Ice sheet models project that a local warming of larger than 3&deg;C, 
          if sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting 
          of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea-level rise of about 
          7 m. A local warming of 5.5&deg;C, if sustained for 1,000 years, would 
          likely result in a contribution from Greenland of about 3 m to sea-level 
          rise.</li>
        <li> Continued warming would increase melting of permafrost in polar, 
          sub-polar, and mountain regions and would make much of this terrain 
          vulnerable to subsidence and landslides which affect infrastructure, 
          water courses, and wetland ecosystems. </li>
