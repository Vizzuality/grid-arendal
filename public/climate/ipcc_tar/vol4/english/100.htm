<i>Models indicate that the illustrative SRES scenarios lead to very different 
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trajectories (see <a href="#figTechSum18">Fig</a><a href="#figTechSum18">ure 
18</a></i>). By 2100, carbon cycle models project atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
of 540 to 970 ppm for the illustrative SRES scenarios (90 to 250% above the concentration 
of 280 ppm in 1750). The net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks as indicated 
by models is to further increase projected atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
by reducing both the ocean and land uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>. These projections 
include the land and ocean climate feedbacks. Uncertainties, especially about 
the magnitude of the climate feedback from the terrestrial biosphere, cause a 
variation of about -10 to +30% around each scenario. The total range is 490 to 
1260 ppm (75 to 350% above the 1750 concentration).<br>
<p><i>Measures to enhance carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems could influence 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, but the upper bound for reduction 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by such means is 40 to 70 ppm.</i> If all the 
  carbon released by historic land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial 
  biosphere over the course of the century (e.g., by reforestation), CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm. Thus, fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions are virtually certain to remain the dominant control over trends in 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration during this century.</p>
<p><i>Model calculations of the abundances of the primary non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse 
  gases by the year 2100 vary considerably across the six illustrative SRES scenarios.</i> 
  In general <a href="099.htm#storya1">A1B</a>, <a href="099.htm#storya1">A1T</a> 
  and <a href="099.htm#storyb1">B1</a> have the smallest increases, and <a href="099.htm#storya1">A1FI</a> 
  and <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a>, the largest. The CH<sub>4</sub> changes 
  from 1998 to 2100 range from -190 to +1970 ppb (-11 to +112%), and N<sub>2</sub>O 
  increases from +38 to +144 ppb (+12 to +46%) (see <a href="099.htm#figTechSum17">Figures 
  17b</a> and <a href="099.htm#figTechSum17">c</a>). The HFCs (134a, 143a, and 
  125) reach abundances of a few hundred to a thousand ppt from negligible levels 
  today. The PFC CF4 is projected to increase to 200 to 400 ppt, and SF<sub>6</sub> 
  is projected to increase to 35 to 65 ppt.</p>
<p><i>For the six illustrative SRES emissions scenarios, projected emissions of 
  indirect greenhouse gases (NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, VOC), together with changes in 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, are projected to change the global mean abundance of the tropospheric 
  hydroxyl radical (OH), by -20% to +6% over the next century.</i> Because of 
  the importance of OH in tropospheric chemistry, comparable, but opposite sign, 
  changes occur in the atmospheric lifetimes of the greenhouse gases CH<sub>4</sub> 
  and HFCs. This impact depends in large part on the magnitude of and the balance 
  between NO<sub>x</sub> and CO emissions. Changes in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  of -12 to +62% are calculated from 2000 until 2100. The largest increase predicted 
  for the 21st century is for scenarios <a href="099.htm#storya1">A1FI</a> and 
  <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a> and would be more than twice as large as that 
  experienced since the Pre-industrial Era. These O<sub>3</sub> increases are 
  attributable to the concurrent and large increases in anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> 
  and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions.</p>
<p><i>The large growth in emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants as 
  projected in some of the six illustrative SRES scenarios for the 21st century 
  will degrade the global environment in ways beyond climate change.</i> Changes 
  projected in the SRES <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a> and <a href="099.htm#storya1">A1FI</a> 
  scenarios would degrade air quality over much of the globe by increasing background 
  levels of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>. In northern mid-latitudes during summer, 
  the zonal average of O<sub>3</sub> increases near the surface are about 30 ppb 
  or more, raising background levels to about 80 ppb, threatening the attainment 
  of current air quality standards over most metropolitan and even rural regions 
  and compromising crop and forest productivity. This problem reaches across continental 
  boundaries and couples emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> on a hemispheric scale.</p>

      that encompasses the full set of thirty five SRES scenarios. The method 
      of calculation closely follows that explained in the chapters. The values 
      are based on the radiative forcing for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> from 
      seven AOGCMs. The IS92a, IS92c, and IS92e forcing is also shown following

<p><i>Except for sulphate and black carbon, models show an approximately linear 
  dependence of the abundance of aerosols on emissions.</i> The processes that 
  determine the removal rate for black carbon differ substantially between the 
  models, leading to major uncertainty in the future projections of black carbon. 
  Emissions of natural aerosols such as sea salt, dust, and gas phase precursors 
  of aerosols such as terpenes, sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and dimethyl 
  sulphide oxidation may increase as a result of changes in climate and atmospheric 
  chemistry.</p>
<p><i>The six illustrative SRES scenarios cover nearly the full range of forcing 
  that results from the full set of SRES scenarios.</i> Estimated total historical 
  anthropogenic radiative forcing from 1765 to 1990 followed by forcing resulting 
  from the six SRES scenarios are shown in <a href="#figTechSum19">Figure 19</a>. 
  The forcing from the full range of 35 SRES scenarios is shown on the figure 
  as a shaded envelope, since the forcings resulting from individual scenarios 
  cross with time. The direct forcing from biomass-burning aerosols is scaled 
  with deforestation rates. The SRES scenarios include the possibility of either 
  increases or decreases in anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., sulphate aerosols, biomass 
  aerosols, and black and organic carbon aerosols), depending on the extent of 
  fossil fuel use and policies to abate polluting emissions. The SRES scenarios 
  do not include emissions estimates for non-sulphate aerosols. Two methods for 
  projecting these emissions were considered in this report: the first scales 
  the emissions of fossil fuel and biomass aerosols with CO while the second scales 
  the emissions with SO<sub>2</sub> and deforestation. Only the second method 
  was used for climate projections. For comparison, radiative forcing is also 
  shown for the IS92a scenario. It is evident that the range for the new SRES 
  scenarios is shifted higher compared to the IS92 scenarios. This is mainly due 
  to the reduced future SO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the SRES scenarios compared 
  to the IS92 scenarios, but also to the slightly larger cumulative carbon emissions 
  featured in some SRES scenarios.</p>
<i>In almost all SRES scenarios, the radiative forcing due to CO<sub>2</sub>, 
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> continue to increase, 
with the fraction of the total radiative forcing due to CO<sub>2</sub> projected 
to increase from slightly more than half to about three-quarters of the total.</i> 
The radiative forcing due to O<sub>3</sub>-depleting gases decreases due to the 
introduction of emission controls aimed at curbing stratospheric ozone depletion. 
The direct aerosol (sulphate and black and organic carbon components taken together) 
radiative forcing (evaluated relative to present day, 2000) varies in sign for 
the different scenarios. The direct plus indirect aerosol effects are projected 
to be smaller in magnitude than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. No estimates are made 
for the spatial aspects of the future forcings. The indirect effect of aerosols 
on clouds is included in simple climate model calculations and scaled non-linearly 
with SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, assuming a present day value of -0.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, 
as in the SAR.<br clear="all">
