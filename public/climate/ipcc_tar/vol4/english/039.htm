      heat transport into high latitudes of Europe (see <a href="038.htm#figspm42">Figure 
      4-2</a>).</span> However, even in models where THC weakens, there is still 
      a warming over Europe due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
      The current projections do not exhibit a complete shutdown of THC by the 
      year 2100. Beyond the year 2100, some models suggest that THC could completely, 
      and possibly irreversibly, shut down in either hemisphere if the change 
      in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough. Models indicate 
      that a decrease in THC reduces its resilience to perturbations (i.e., a 
      once-reduced THC appears to be less stable and a shutdown can become more 
      likely).<br>

      an associated sea-level rise of several meters, but there is an incomplete

      been expressed about the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet because 
      it is grounded below sea level. However, loss of grounded ice leading to 
      substantial sea-level rise from this source is widely agreed to be very 
      unlikely during the 21st century. Current climate<br>
      and ice dynamic models project that over the next 100 years the Antarctic 
      ice sheet as a whole is likely to gain mass because of a projected increase 
      in precipitation, contributing to a relative decrease of several centimeters 
      to sea level. Over the next 1,000 years, these models project that the West 
      Antarctic ice sheet could contribute up to 3m to sea-level rise.<br>

      likely to lose mass during the 21st century and contribute a few centimeters 
      to sea-level rise. </span>Over the 21st century, the Greenland ice sheet 
      is likely to lose mass because the projected increase in runoff will exceed 
      the increase in precipitation and contribute 10 cm maximum to the total 
      sea-level rise. The ice sheets will continue to react to climate warming 
      and contribute to sea-level rise for thousands of years after climate has 
      stabilized. Climate models indicate that the local warming over Greenland 
      is likely to be one to three times the global average. Ice sheet models 
      project that a local warming of larger than 3&deg;C, if sustained for thousands 
      of years, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice 
      sheet with a resulting sea-level rise of about 7 m. A local warming of 5.5&deg;C, 
      if sustained for 1,000 years, would likely result in a contribution from 
      Greenland of about 3 m to sea-level rise (see <a href="026.htm">Question 
      3</a>).<br>

    <td align="left" colspan="2"><span class="blue2">Pronounced changes in permafrost 
      temperature, surface morphology, and distribution are expected in the 21st 
      century.</span> Permafrost currently underlies 24.5% of the exposed land 
      area of the Northern Hemisphere. Under climatic warming, much of this terrain 
      would be vulnerable to subsidence, particularly in areas of relatively warm, 
      discontinuous permafrost. The area of the Northern Hemisphere occupied by 
      permafrost could eventually be reduced by 12 to 22% of its current extent 
      and could eventually disappear from half the present-day Canadian permafrost 
      region. The changes on the southern limit may become obvious by the late 
      21st century, but some thick ice-rich permafrost could persist in relict 
      form for centuries or millennia. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be accompanied 
      by mass movements and subsidence of the surface, possibly increasing the 
      sediment loads in water courses and causing damage to the infrastructure 
      in developed regions. Depending on the precipitation regime and drainage 
      conditions, degradation of permafrost could lead to emission of greenhouse 
      gases, conversion of forest to bogs, grasslands, or wetland ecosystems and 
      could cause major erosion problems and landslides.<br>
