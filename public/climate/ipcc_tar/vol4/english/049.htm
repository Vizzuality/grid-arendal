      concentrations of greenhouse gases at lower levels would generate greater 
      benefits in terms of less damage.</span> Stabilization at lower levels reduces 
      the risk of exceeding temperature thresholds in biophysical systems where 
      these exist. Stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> at, for example, 450 ppm is 
      estimated to yield an increase in global mean temperature in the year 2100 
      that is about 0.75 to 1.25&deg;C less than is estimated for stabilization 
      at 1,000 ppm (see <a href="048.htm#figspm62">Figure 6-2</a>). 
      At equilibrium the difference is about 2 to 5&deg;C. The geographical 
      extent of the damage to or loss of natural systems, and the number of systems 
      affected, which increase with the magnitude and rate of climate change, 
      would be lower for a lower stabilization level. Similarly, for a lower stabilization 
      level the severity of impacts from climate extremes is expected to be less, 
      fewer regions would suffer adverse net market sector impacts, global aggregate 
      impacts would be smaller, and risks of large-scale high-impact events would 
      be reduced. <a href="#figspm63">Figure 6-3</a> presents a 
      summary of climate change risks or reasons for concern (see <a href="029.htm#box32">Box 
      3-2</a>) juxtaposed against the ranges of global mean temperature change

      in understanding the qualitative character of the impacts of future climate
      change, the impacts that would result under different scenarios are incompletely
      quantified. Because of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, and uncertainty
      about the geographic and seasonal patterns of changes in temperatures,
      precipitation,
      and other climate variables and phenomena, the impacts of climate change
      cannot be uniquely determined for individual emission scenarios. There
      are
      also uncertainties about key processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities
      of systems to changes in climate. In addition, impacts such as changes
      in
      the composition and function of ecological systems, species extinction,
      and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution of impacts
      across different populations and regions, are not readily expressed in
      monetary
      or other
      common units. Because of these limitations, the benefits of different greenhouse
      gas reduction actions, including actions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations
      at selected levels, are incompletely characterized and cannot be compared
      directly to mitigation costs for the purpose of estimating the net economic
      effects of mitigation.<br>

      <b><a name="figspm63"></a>Figure 6-3: Risks of climate change damages would 
      be reduced by stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. </b>The risks of 
      adverse impacts from climate change are depicted for different magnitudes 
      of global mean temperature change, where global mean temperature change 
      is used as a proxy for the magnitude of climate change. Estimates of global 
      mean temperature change by the year 2100 relative to the year 1990 are shown 
      on the righthand side of the figure for scenarios that would lead to stabilization 
      of the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> , as well as for the 
      full set of SRES projections. Many risks associated with warming above 3.5&deg;C 
      by the year 2100 would be avoided by stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
      at or below 1,000 ppm. Stabilization at a lower level would reduce risks 
      further.White indicates neutral or small negative or small positive impacts 
      or risks; yellow indicates negative impacts for some systems or low risks; 
      and red means negative impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or 
      greater in magnitude. The assessment of impacts or risks takes into account 
      only the magnitude of change and not the rate of change. Global mean annual 
      temperature change is used as a proxy for the magnitude of climate change, 
      but impacts would be a function of, among other factors, the magnitude and 
      rate of global and regional changes in mean climate, climate variability 
      and extreme climate phenomena, social and economic conditions, and adaptation.<br>
