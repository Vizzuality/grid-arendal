      <p><span class="blue2">By capturing synergies, some greenhouse gas mitigation 
        actions may yield extensive ancillary benefits for several other environmental 
        problems, but also trade-offs may occur.</span> Examples include, <em>inter 
        alia</em>, reduction of negative environmental impacts such as air pollution 
        and acid deposition; protecting forests, soils, and watersheds; reducing 
        distortionary subsidies and taxes; and inducing more efficient technological 
        change and diffusion, contributing to wider goals of sustainable development. 
        However, dependent on the way climate change or other environmental problems 
        are addressed, and the degree to which interlinking issues are taken into 
        account, significant trade-offs may occur and unanticipated costs may 
        be incurred. For example, policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
        from the energy and land-use sectors can have both positive and negative 
        effects on other environmental problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the energy sector, greenhouse gas emissions as well as local and
          regional pollutants could be reduced through more efficient and environmentally
          sound use of energy and increasing the share of lower carbon emitting
          fossil fuels, advanced fossil-fuel technologies (e.g., highly efficient
          combined cycle gas turbines, fuel cells, and combined
          heat and power), and renewable energy technologies (e.g., increased
          use of environmentally sound biofuels, hydropower, solar, wind- and
          wave-power). Increased use of biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel
          could have positive or negative impacts on soils, biodiversity, and
          water availability depending on the land use it replaces and the management
          regime.</li>
        <li>In the land-use sector, conservation of biological carbon pools not
          only prevents carbon from being emitted into the atmosphere, it also
          can have a favorable effect on soil productivity, prevent biodiversity
          loss, and reduce air pollution problems from biomass burning. Carbon
          sequestration by plantation forestry can enhance carbon sinks and
          protect soils and watersheds, but -- if developed improperly -- may 
          have negative effects on biodiversity and water availability. For example, 
          in some implementations, monoculture plantations could decrease local 
          biodiversity.<br>

        than climate change can have ancillary climate benefits, but the linkages 
        between the various problems may also lead to trade-offs.</span> Examples 
        include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are likely to be substantial greenhouse gas benefits from policies 
          aimed at reducing air pollution. For example, increasing pollution is 
          often associated with the rapidly growing transportation sector in all 
          regions, involving emissions of particulate matter and precursors of 
          ozone pollution. Addressing these emissions to reduce the impacts on 
          human health, agriculture, and forestry through increasing energy efficiency 
          or penetration of non-fossil-fuel energy can also reduce greenhouse 
          gas emissions.</li>
        <li>Controlling sulfur emissions has positive impacts on human health 
          and vegetation, but sulfate aerosols partly offset the warming effect 
          of greenhouse gases and therefore control of sulfur emissions can amplify 
          possible climate change. If sulfur emissions are controlled through 
          desulfurization of flue gases at power plants, an energy penalty results, 
          with associated increase of greenhouse gas emissions.<br>

    <td width="75%"><span class="blue2">Adopting environmentally sound technologies 
      and practices offer particular opportunities for economically, environmentally, 
      and socially sound development while avoiding greenhouse gas-intensive activities. 
      </span>For example, the application of supply- and demand-side energy-efficient
      technologies simultaneously reduces various energy-related environmental
      impacts and can lower the pressure on energy investments, reduce public
      investments, improve export competitiveness, and enlarge energy reserves.
      The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices (e.g., in Africa)
      illustrates the mutually reinforcing effects of climate change mitigation,
      environmental protection, and long-term
      economic benefits. The introduction or expansion of agroforestry and balanced
      fertilizer agriculture can improve food security and at the same time reduce
      greenhouse gas emissions. More decentralized development patterns based
      on a stronger role for small- and medium-sized cities can decrease the
      migration
      of rural population into urban centers, reduce needs for transportation,
      and allow the use of environmentally sound technologies (bio-fuel, solar
      energy, wind, and small-scale hydropower) to tap the large reserves of
      natural resources.<br>

        reduce vulnerability to other environmental stresses and <em>vice versa</em>.</span> 
        Examples include, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Protecting threatened ecosystems: </em>Removing societal stresses 
          and managing resources in a sustainable manner may help unique and threatened 
          systems also to cope with the additional stress posed by climate change. 
          Accounting for potential climatic changes and integration with socio-economic 
          needs and development plans can make biodiversity<br>
          conservation strategies and climate change adaptation measures more 
          effective.</li>
        <li><em>Land-use management: </em>Addressing or avoiding land degradation 
          also decreases vulnerability to climate change, especially when response 
          strategies consider the social and economic factors defining the land-use 
          practices together with the additional risks imposed by climate change. 
          In regions where deforestation is progressing and leading<br>
          to carbon loss and increased peak runoff, restoring vegetation by reforestation 
          (and when possible by afforestation) and revegetation can help to combat 
          desertification.</li>
        <li><em>Freshwater management: </em>Problems with availability, abundance, 
          and pollution of freshwater, which are often caused by demographic and 
          development pressures, can be exacerbated by climate change. Reducing 
          vulnerability to water stress (e.g., by water conservation, water-demand 
          management, and more efficient water use) also reduces<br>
          vulnerability to additional stress by climate change.</li>
