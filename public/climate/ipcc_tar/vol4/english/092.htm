<h2>D.1 Climate Processes and Feedbacks</h2>
Processes in the climate system determine the natural variability of the climate 
system and its response to perturbations, such as the increase in the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases. Many basic climate processes of importance 
are well-known and modelled exceedingly well. Feedback processes amplify (a positive 
feedback) or reduce (a negative feedback) changes in response to an initial perturbation 
and hence are very important for accurate simulation of the evolution of climate. <br>
<a name="water"></a>
<h3>Water vapour</h3>
<i>A major feedback accounting for the large warming predicted by climate models 
in response to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> is the increase in atmospheric water 
vapour. </i>An increase in the temperature of the atmosphere increases its water-holding 
capacity; however, since most of the atmosphere is undersaturated, this does not 
automatically mean that water vapour, itself, must increase. Within the boundary 
layer (roughly the lowest 1 to 2 km of the atmosphere), water vapour increases 
with increasing temperature. In the free troposphere above the boundary layer, 
where the water vapour greenhouse effect is most important, the situation is harder 
to quantify. Water vapour feedback, as derived from current models, approximately 
doubles the warming from what it would be for fixed water vapour. Since the SAR, 
major improvements have occurred in the treatment of water vapour in models, although 
detrainment of moisture from clouds remains quite uncertain and discrepancies 
exist between model water vapour distributions and those observed. Models are 
capable of simulating the moist and very dry regions observed in the tropics and 
sub-tropics and how they evolve with the seasons and from year to year. While 
reassuring, this does not provide a check of the feedbacks, although the balance 
of evidence favours a positive clear-sky water vapour feedback of the magnitude 
comparable to that found in simulations.<br>
<a name="clouds"></a>
<h3>Clouds</h3>
As has been the case since the first IPCC Assessment Report in 1990, probably 
the greatest uncertainty in future projections of climate arises from clouds and 
their interactions with radiation. Clouds can both absorb and reflect solar radiation 
(thereby cooling the surface) and absorb and emit long wave radiation (thereby 
warming the surface). The competition between these effects depends on cloud height, 
thickness and radiative properties. The radiative properties and evolution of 
clouds depend on the distribution of atmospheric water vapour, water drops, ice 
particles, atmospheric aerosols and cloud thickness. The physical basis of cloud 
parametrizations is greatly improved in models through inclusion of bulk representation 
of cloud microphysical properties in a cloud water budget equation, although considerable 
uncertainty remains. Clouds represent a significant source of potential error 
in climate simulations. The possibility that models underestimate systematically 
solar absorption in clouds remains a controversial matter. The sign of the net 
cloud feedback is still a matter of uncertainty, and the various models exhibit 
a large spread. Further uncertainties arise from precipitation processes and the 
difficulty in correctly simulating the diurnal cycle and precipitation amounts 
and frequencies.<br>
<a name="stratosphere"></a>
<h3>Stratosphere</h3>
<i>There has been a growing appreciation of the importance of the stratosphere 
in the climate system because of changes in its structure and recognition of the 
vital role of both radiative and dynamical processes.</i> The vertical profile 
of temperature change in the atmosphere, including the stratosphere, is an important 
indicator in detection and attribution studies. Most of the observed decreases 
in lower-stratospheric temperatures have been due to ozone decreases, of which 
the Antarctic "ozone hole" is a part, rather than increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentrations. Waves generated in the troposphere can propagate into the stratosphere 
where they are absorbed. As a result, stratospheric changes alter where and how 
these waves are absorbed, and the effects can extend downward into the troposphere. 
Changes in solar irradiance, mainly in the ultraviolet (UV), lead to photochemically-induced 
ozone changes and, hence, alter the stratospheric heating rates, which can alter 
the tropospheric circulation. Limitations in resolution and relatively poor representation 
of some stratospheric processes adds uncertainty to model results.<br>
<a name="ocean"></a>
<h3>Ocean</h3>
<i>Major improvements have taken place in modelling ocean processes, in particular 
heat transport. These improvements, in conjunction with an increase in resolution, 
have been important in reducing the need for flux adjustment in models and in 
producing realistic simulations of natural large-scale circulation patterns and 
improvements in simulating El Ni&ntilde;o (see <a href="#box4">Box 4</a>).</i> 
Ocean currents carry heat from the tropics to higher latitudes. The ocean exchanges 
heat, water (through evaporation and precipitation) and CO<sub>2</sub> with the 
atmosphere. Because of its huge mass and high heat capacity, the ocean slows climate 
change and influences the time-scales of variability in the ocean-atmosphere system. 
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of ocean processes relevant 
for climate change. Increases in resolution, as well as improved representation 
(parametrization) of important sub-grid scale processes (e.g., mesoscale eddies), 
have increased the realism of simulations. Major uncertainties still exist with 
the representation of small-scale processes, such as overflows (flow through narrow 
channels, e.g., between Greenland and Iceland), western boundary currents (i.e., 
large-scale narrow currents along coastlines), convection and mixing. Boundary 
currents in climate simulations are weaker and wider than in nature, although 
the consequences of this for climate are not clear.<br>

      <p><b>Box 4: Climate Models: How are they built and how are they applied?</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>The strongest natural fluctuation of climate on interannual time-scales 
        is the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The term 
        "El Ni&ntilde;o" originally applied to an annual weak warm ocean 
        current that ran southwards along the coast of Peru about Christmas-time 
        and only subsequently became associated with the unusually large warmings. 
        The coastal warming, however, is often associated with a much more extensive 
        anomalous ocean warming to the International Dateline, and it is this 
        Pacific basinwide phenomenon that forms the link with the anomalous global 
        climate patterns. The atmospheric component tied to "El Ni&ntilde;o" 
        is termed the "Southern Oscillation". Scientists often call 
        this phenomenon, where the atmosphere and ocean collaborate together, 
        ENSO (El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation).</p>
      <p>ENSO is a natural phenomenon, and there is good evidence from cores of 
        coral and glacial ice in the Andes that it has been going on for millennia. 
        The ocean and atmospheric conditions in the tropical Pacific are seldom 
        average, but instead fluctuate somewhat irregularly between El Ni&ntilde;o 
        events and the opposite "La Ni&ntilde;a" phase, consisting of 
        a basinwide cooling of the tropical Pacific, with a preferred period of 
        about three to six years. The most intense phase of each event usually 
        lasts about a year.</p>
      <p>A distinctive pattern of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean 
        sets the stage for ENSO events. Key features are the "warm pool" 
        in the tropical western Pacific, where the warmest ocean waters in the 
        world reside, much colder waters in the eastern Pacific, and a cold tongue 
        along the equator that is most pronounced about October and weakest in 
        March. The atmospheric easterly trade winds in the tropics pile up the 
        warm waters in the west, producing an upward slope of sea level along 
        the equator of 0.60 m from east to west. The winds drive the surface ocean 
        currents, which determine where the surface waters flow and diverge. Thus, 
        cooler nutrient-rich waters upwell from below along the equator and western 
        coasts of the Americas, favouring development of phytoplankton, zooplankton, 
        and hence fish. Because convection and thunderstorms preferentially occur 
        over warmer waters, the pattern of sea surface temperatures determines 
        the distribution of rainfall in the tropics, and this in turn determines 
        the atmospheric heating patterns through the release of latent heat. The 
        heating drives the large-scale monsoonal-type circulations in the tropics, 
        and consequently determines the winds. This strong coupling between the 
        atmosphere and ocean in the tropics gives rise to the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon.</p>
      <p>During El Ni&ntilde;o, the warm waters from the western tropical Pacific 
        migrate eastward as the trade winds weaken, shifting the pattern of tropical 
        rainstorms, further weakening the trade winds, and thus reinforcing the 
        changes in sea temperatures. Sea level drops in the west, but rises in 
        the east by as much as 0.25 m, as warm waters surge eastward along the 
        equator. However, the changes in atmospheric circulation are not confined 
        to the tropics, but extend globally and influence the jet streams and 
        storm tracks in mid-latitudes. Approximately reverse patterns occur during 
        the opposite La Ni&ntilde;a phase of the phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Changes associated with ENSO produce large variations in weather and climate 
        around the world from year to year. These often have a profound impact 
        on humanity and society because of associated droughts, floods, heat waves 
        and other changes that can severely disrupt agriculture, fisheries, the 
        environment, health, energy demand, air quality and also change the risks 
        of fire. ENSO also plays a prominent role in modulating exchanges of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        with the atmosphere. The normal upwelling of cold nutrient-rich and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich 
        waters in the tropical Pacific is suppressed during El Ni&ntilde;o.</p>

<h3>Cryosphere</h3>
<i>The representation of sea-ice processes continues to improve, with several 
climate models now incorporating physically based treatments of ice dynamics. 
The representation of land-ice processes in global climate models remains rudimentary.</i> 
The cryosphere consists of those regions of Earth that are seasonally or perennially 
covered by snow and ice. Sea ice is important because it reflects more incoming 
solar radiation than the sea surface (i.e., it has a higher albedo), and it insulates 
the sea from heat loss during the winter. Therefore, reduction of sea ice gives 
a positive feedback on climate warming at high latitudes. Furthermore, because 
sea ice contains less salt than sea water, when sea ice is formed the salt content 
(salinity) and density of the surface layer of the ocean is increased. This promotes 
an exchange of water with deeper layers of the ocean, affecting ocean circulation. 
The formation of icebergs and the melting of ice shelves returns fresh water from 
the land to the ocean, so that changes in the rates of these processes could affect 
ocean circulation by changing the surface salinity. Snow has a higher albedo than 
the land surface; hence, reductions in snow cover lead to a similar positive albedo 
feedback, although weaker than for sea ice. Increasingly complex snow schemes 
and sub-grid scale variability in ice cover and thickness, which can significantly 
influence albedo and atmosphere-ocean exchanges, are being introduced in some 
climate models.<br>
<a name="land"></a>
<h3>Land surface</h3>
<i>Research with models containing the latest representations of the land surface 
indicates that the direct effects of increased CO<sub>2</sub> on the physiology 
of plants could lead to a relative reduction in evapotranspiration over the tropical 
continents, with associated regional warming and drying over that predicted for 
conventional greenhouse warming effects. </i>Land surface changes provide important 
feedbacks as anthropogenic climate changes (e.g., increased temperature, changes 
in precipitation, changes in net radiative heating, and the direct effects of 
CO<sub>2</sub>) will influence the state of the land surface (e.g., soil moisture, 
albedo, roughness and vegetation). Exchanges of energy, momentum, water, heat 
and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere can be defined in models 
as functions of the type and density of the local vegetation and the depth and 
physical properties of the soil, all based on land-surface data bases that have 
been improved using satellite observations. Recent advances in the understanding 
of vegetation photosynthesis and water use have been used to couple the terrestrial 
energy, water and carbon cycles within a new generation of land surface parametrizations, 
which have been tested against field observations and implemented in a few GCMs, 
with demonstrable improvements in the simulation of land-atmosphere fluxes. However, 
significant problems remain to be solved in the areas of soil moisture processes, 
runoff prediction, land-use change and the treatment of snow and sub-grid scale 
heterogeneity.<br>
<p>Changes in land-surface cover can affect global climate in several ways. Large-scale 
deforestation in the humid tropics (e.g., South America, Africa, and Southeast 
Asia) has been identified as the most important ongoing land-surface process, 
because it reduces evaporation and increases surface temperature. These effects 
are qualitatively reproduced by most models. However, large uncertainties still 
persist on the quantitative impact of large-scale deforestation on the hydrological 
cycle, particularly over Amazonia.</p>
<a name="carbon"></a>
<h3>Carbon cycle</h3>
<i>Recent improvements in process-based terrestrial and ocean carbon cycle models 
and their evaluation against observations have given more confidence in their 
use for future scenario studies.</i> CO<sub>2</sub> naturally cycles rapidly among 
the atmosphere, oceans and land. However, the removal of the CO<sub>2</sub> perturbation 
added by human activities from the atmosphere takes far longer. This is because 
of processes that limit the rate at which ocean and terrestrial carbon stocks 
can increase. Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is taken up by the ocean because of 
its high solubility (caused by the nature of carbonate chemistry), but the rate 
of uptake is limited by the finite speed of vertical mixing. Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems through several possible mechanisms, for 
example, land management, CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation (the enhancement of plant 
growth as a result of increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) and 
increasing anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen. This uptake is limited by the relatively 
small fraction of plant carbon that can enter long-term storage (wood and humus). 
The fraction of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> that can be taken up by the oceans and 
land is expected to decline with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Process-based 
models of the ocean and land carbon cycles (including representations of physical, 
chemical and biological processes) have been developed and evaluated against measurements 
pertinent to the natural carbon cycle. Such models have also been set up to mimic 
the human perturbation of the carbon cycle and have been able to generate time-series 
of ocean and land carbon uptake that are broadly consistent with observed global 
trends. There are still substantial differences among models, especially in how 
they treat the physical ocean circulation and in regional responses of terrestrial 
ecosystem processes to climate. Nevertheless, current models consistently indicate 
that when the effects of climate change are considered, CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
by oceans and land becomes smaller.<br>
