      potential emissions reductions could be achieved by the year 2020 with direct 
      benefits (energy saved) exceeding direct costs (net capital, operating, 
      and maintenance costs), and the other half at a net direct cost of up to 
      US$100 per t C<sub>eq</sub> (at 1998 prices). These net direct cost estimates 
      are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to 12%, consistent with 
      public sector discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly, 
      and are often significantly higher, affecting the rate of adoption of these

      depends upon land and water availability as well as the rates of adoption

      mechanisms, and their interactions with domestic measures (see <a href="#figspm8">Figure 
      SPM-8</a> for comparison of regional Annex II mitigation costs).</span> 
      The great majority of global studies reporting and comparing these costs 
      use international energy-economic models. Nine of these studies suggest 
      the following GDP impacts. In the absence of emissions trade between Annex 
      B countries, these studies show reductions in projected GDP<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
      of about 0.2 to 2% in the year 2010 for different Annex II regions. With 
      full emissions trading between Annex B countries, the estimated reductions 
      in the year 2010 are between 0.1 and 1.1% of projected GDP. The global modeling 
      studies reported above show national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets 
      from about US$20 up to US$600 per t C without trading, and a range from 
      about US$15 up to US$150 per t C with Annex B trading. For most economies-in-transition 
      countries, GDP effects range from negligible to a several percent increase. 
      However, for some economies-in-transition countries, implementing the Kyoto 
      Protocol will have similar impact on GDP as for Annex II countries. At the 
      time of these studies, most models did not include sinks, non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
      greenhouse gases, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), negative cost options, 
      ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling, the inclusion of which 
      will reduce estimated costs. On the other hand, these models make assumptions 
      which underestimate costs because they assume full use of emissions trading 
      without transaction costs, both within and among Annex B countries, and 
      that mitigation responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies 
      begin to adjust to the need to meet Kyoto targets between 1990 and 2000. 
      The cost reductions from Kyoto mechanisms may depend on the details of implementation, 
      including the compatibility of domestic and international mechanisms, constraints, 
      and transaction costs.<a name="figspm8"></a></td>

      II countries in the year 2010 from global models: (a) GDP losses and (b) 
      marginal costs.</strong>&nbsp;The reductions in projected GDP are for the 
      year 2010 relative to the models' reference case GDP. These estimates 
      are based on results from nine modeling teams that participated in an Energy 
      Modeling Forum study. The projections reported in the figure are for four 
      regions that constitute Annex II. The models examined two scenarios. In 
      the first, each region makes the prescribed reduction with only domestic 
      trading in carbon emissions. In the second, Annex B trading is permitted, 
      and thereby marginal costs are equal across regions. For each case or region, 
      the maximum, minimum, and median values across all models of the estimated 
      marginal costs are shown. For the key factors, assumptions, and uncertainties
