<h2>Options to Limit or Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions <br>
  and Enhance Sinks</h2>
<p><a name="7"></a>7. <i>Significant technical progress relevant to greenhouse 
  gas emissions reduction has been made since the SAR in 1995 and has been faster 
  than anticipated</i>. Advances are taking place in a wide range of technologies 
  at different stages of development, e.g., the market introduction of wind turbines, 
  the rapid elimination of industrial by-product gases such as N<sub>2</sub>O 
  from adipic acid production and perfluorocarbons from aluminium production, 
  efficient hybrid engine cars, the advancement of fuel cell technology, and the 
  demonstration of underground carbon dioxide storage. Technological options for 
  emissions reduction include improved efficiency of end use devices and energy 
  conversion technologies, shift to low-carbon and renewable biomass fuels, zero-emissions 
  technologies, improved energy management, reduction of industrial by-product 
  and process gas emissions, and carbon removal and storage (Section  <a href="../../wg3/091.htm">3.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg3/176.htm">4.7</a>).</p>
<p><a href="160.htm#tabspm1">Table SPM.1</a> summarizes the results from many 
  sectoral studies, largely at the project, national and regional level with some 
  at the global levels, providing estimates of potential greenhouse gas emission 
  reductions in the 2010 to 2020 timeframe. Some key findings are:<br>
  <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hundreds of technologies and practices for end-use energy efficiency in 
    buildings, transport and manufacturing industries account for more than half 
    of this potential (Sections <a href="../../wg3/093.htm">3.3</a>, 
     <a href="../../wg3/098.htm">3.4</a>, <a href="../../wg3/107.htm">3.5</a>).</li>
  <li>At least up to 2020, energy supply and conversion will remain dominated 
    by relatively cheap and abundant fossil fuels. Natural gas, where transmission 
    is economically feasible, will play an important role in emission reduction 
    together with conversion efficiency improvement, and greater use of combined 
    cycle and/or co-generation plants (<a href="../../wg3/126.htm#384">Section 
    3.8.4</a>).</li>
  <li>Low-carbon energy supply systems can make an important contribution through 
    biomass from forestry and agricultural by-products, municipal and industrial 
    waste to energy, dedicated biomass plantations, where suitable land and water 
    are available, landfill methane, wind energy and hydropower, and through the 
    use and lifetime extension of nuclear power plants. After 2010, emissions 
    from fossil and/or biomass-fueled power plants could be reduced substantially 
    through pre- or post-combustion carbon removal and storage. Environmental, 
    safety, reliability and proliferation concerns may constrain the use of some 
    of these technologies (<a href="../../wg3/126.htm#384">Section 
    3.8.4</a>).</li>
  <li>In agriculture, methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced, such 
    as those from livestock enteric fermentation, rice paddies, nitrogen fertilizer 
    use and animal wastes (<a href="../../wg3/115.htm">Section 
    3.6</a>).</li>
  <li>Depending on application, emissions of fluorinated gases can be minimized 
    through process changes, improved recovery, recycling and containment, or 
    avoided through the use of alternative compounds and technologies (<a href="../../wg3/107.htm">Section 
    3.5</a> and <a href="../../wg3/142.htm">Chapter 
    3 Appendix</a>). <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The potential emissions reductions found in<a href="160.htm#tabspm1"> 
  Table SPM.1</a> for sectors were aggregated to provide estimates of global potential 
  emissions reductions taking account of potential overlaps between and within 
  sectors and technologies to the extent possible given the information available 
  in the underlying studies. Half of these potential emissions reductions may 
  be achieved by 2020 with direct benefits (energy saved) exceeding direct costs 
  (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs), and the other half at a net 
  direct cost of up to US$100/tC<sub>eq</sub> (at 1998 prices). These cost estimates 
  are derived using discount rates in the range of 5% to 12%, consistent with 
  public sector discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly, 
  and are often significantly higher, affecting the rate of adoption of these 
  technologies by private entities. </p>
<p>Depending on the emissions scenario this could allow global emissions to be 
  reduced below 2000 levels in 2010-2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing 
  these reductions involve additional implementation costs, which in some cases 
  may be substantial, the possible need for supporting policies (such as those 
  described in <a href="162.htm#18">Paragraph 18</a>), increased research and 
  development, effective technology transfer and overcoming other barriers (<a href="162.htm">Paragraph 
  17</a>). These issues, together with costs and benefits not included in this 
  evaluation are discussed in <a href="161.htm">Paragraphs 11</a>, <a href="161.htm#12">12</a> 
  and <a href="161.htm#13">13</a>. </p>
<p>The various global, regional, national, sector and project studies assessed 
  in this report have different scopes and assumptions. Studies do not exist for 
  every sector and region. The range of emissions reductions reported in <a href="160.htm#tabspm1">Table 
  SPM.1</a> reflects the uncertainties (see <a href="160.htm#boxspm2">Box SPM.2</a>) 
  of the underlying studies on which they are based (<a href="../../wg3/093.htm">Sections 
  3.3</a>-<a href="../../wg3/124.htm">3.8</a>)<a name="boxspm1"></a></p>

        <p><b>Box SPM.1. The Emissions Scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on 
          Emissions Scenarios (SRES<br>
          </b>A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world 
          of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century 
          and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more 
          efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among 
          regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, 
          with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. 
          The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative 
          directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 
          groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive 
          (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources 
          (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular 
          energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply 
          to all energy supply and end use technologies). </p>
        <p>A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous 
          world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local 
          identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, 
          which results in continuously increasing population. Economic development 
          is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and 
          technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines.</p>
        <p>B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world 
          with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and declines 
          thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic 
          structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions 
          in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient 
          technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social 
          and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without 
          additional climate initiatives.</p>
        <p>B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which 
          the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental 
          sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, 
          at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, 
          and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 
          and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental 
          protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</p>
        <p>An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups 
          A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be considered equally sound.</p>
        <p>The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which 
          means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation 
          of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the 
          emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

<p><a name="8"></a>8. <i>Forests, agricultural lands, and other 
  terrestrial ecosystems offer significant carbon mitigation potential. Although 
  not necessarily permanent, conservation and sequestration of carbon may allow 
  time for other options to be further developed and implemented</i>. Biological 
  mitigation can occur by three strategies: (a) conservation of existing carbon 
  pools, (b) sequestration by increasing the size of carbon pools, and (c) substitution 
  of sustainably produced biological products, e.g. wood for energy intensive 
  construction products and biomass for fossil fuels (Sections <a href="../../wg3/115.htm">3.6</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg3/164.htm">4.3</a>). Conservation of threatened 
  carbon pools may help to avoid emissions, if leakage can be prevented, and can 
  only become sustainable if the socio-economic drivers for deforestation and 
  other losses of carbon pools can be addressed. Sequestration reflects the biological 
  dynamics of growth, often starting slowly, passing through a maximum, and then 
  declining over decades to centuries. </p>
<p>Conservation and sequestration result in higher carbon stocks, but can lead 
  to higher future carbon emissions if these ecosystems are severely disturbed 
  by either natural or direct/indirect human-induced disturbances. Even though 
  natural disturbances are normally followed by re-sequestration, activities to 
  manage such disturbances can play an important role in limiting carbon emissions. 
  Substitution benefits can, in principle, continue indefinitely. Appropriate 
  management of land for crop, timber and sustainable bio-energy production, may 
  increase benefits for climate change mitigation. Taking into account competition 
  for land use and the SAR and <a href="/climate/ipcc/land_use/index.htm">SRLULUCF</a> 
  assessments, the estimated global potential of biological mitigation options 
  is in the order of 100GtC (cumulative), although there are substantial uncertainties 
  associated with this estimate, by 2050, equivalent to about 10% to 20% of potential 
  fossil fuel emissions during that period. Realization of this potential depends 
  upon land and water availability as well as the rates of adoption of different 
  land management practices. The largest biological potential for atmospheric 
  carbon mitigation is in subtropical and tropical regions. Cost estimates reported 
  to date of biological mitigation vary significantly from US$0.1/tC to about 
  US$20/tC in several tropical countries and from US$20/tC to US$100/tC in non-tropical 
  countries. Methods of financial analysis and carbon accounting have not been 
  comparable. Moreover, the cost calculations do not cover, in many instances, 
  inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate discounting, monitoring, data 
  collection and implementation costs, opportunity costs of land and maintenance, 
  or other recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. The lower 
  end of the ranges are biased downwards, but understanding and treatment of costs 
  is improving over time. These biological mitigation options may have social, 
  economic and environmental benefits beyond reductions in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  if implemented appropriately. (e.g., biodiversity, watershed protection, enhancement 
  of sustainable land management and rural employment). However, if implemented 
  inappropriately, they may pose risks of negative impacts (e.g., loss of biodiversity, 
  community disruption and ground-water pollution). Biological mitigation options 
  may reduce or increase non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions (Sections 
  <a href="../../wg3/164.htm">4.3</a>, <a href="../../wg3/169.htm">4.4</a>).<a name="figspm2"></a>

        at a range of levels. Note that if by 2100 cumulative emissions associated 
        with SRES scenarios are equal to or smaller than those for stabilization 
        scenarios, this does not imply that these scenarios equally lead to stabilization.
