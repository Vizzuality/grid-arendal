<h3>5.1.4. Human Health</h3>
<p><i>Changes in temperature and rainfall will have many negative impacts on human 
  health.</i> Temperature increases will extend disease vector habitats. Where 
  sanitary infrastructure is inadequate, droughts and flooding will result in 
  increased frequency of water-borne diseases. Increased rainfall could lead to 
  more frequent outbreaks of Rift Valley fever. Poor sanitation in urban locations 
  and increased temperatures of coastal waters could aggravate cholera epidemics. 
  [<a href="../../wg2/396.htm#10241">10.2.4.1</a>, <a href="../../wg2/397.htm#10244">10.2.4.4</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="515"></a>5.1.5. Settlements and Infrastructure</h3>
<p><i>Although the basic infrastructure for development -- transport, housing, 
  and services -- is inadequate in many instances, it nevertheless represents 
  substantial investment by governments.</i> An increase in the frequency of damaging 
  floods, heat waves, dust storms, hurricanes, and other extreme events could 
  degrade the integrity of such critical infrastructures at rates the economies 
  may not be able to tolerate, leading to a serious deterioration of social, health, 
  and economic services delivery systems. This condition will greatly compromise 
  general human welfare. [<a href="../../wg2/400.htm">10.2.5.3</a>]</p>
<p><i>Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, and flooding will 
  have significant impacts for African communities and economies.</i> Most of 
  Africa's largest cities are along coasts and are highly vulnerable to extreme 
  events, sea-level rise, and coastal erosion because of inadequate physical planning 
  and escalating urban drift. Rapid unplanned expansion is likely to predispose 
  large populations to infectious diseases from climate-related factors such as 
  flooding. [<a href="../../wg2/399.htm#10252">10.2.5.2</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="516"></a>5.1.6. Desertification</h3>
<p><i>Alteration of spatial and temporal patterns in temperature, rainfall, solar 
  radiation, and winds from a changing climate will exacerbate desertification. 
  </i> Desertification is a critical threat to sustainable resource management 
  in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid regions of Africa, undermining food and 
  water security. [<a href="../../wg2/402.htm">10.2.6</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="517"></a>5.1.7. Adaptive Capacity</h3>
<p><i>Given the diversity of constraints facing many nations, the overall capacity 
  for Africa to adapt to climate change currently is very low.</i> National action 
  plans that incorporate long-term changes and pursue "no regrets" strategies 
  could increase the adaptive capacity of the region. Seasonal forecasting -- for 
  example, linking SSTs to outbreaks of major diseases -- is a promising adaptive 
  strategy that will help save lives. Current technologies and approaches, especially 
  in agriculture and water, are unlikely to be adequate to meet projected demands, 
  and increased climate variability will be an additional stress. It is unlikely 
  that African countries on their own will have sufficient resources to respond 
  effectively.</p>
<p>Climate change also offers some opportunities. The processes of adapting to 
  global climate change, including technology transfer and carbon sequestration, 
  offer new development pathways that could take advantage of Africa's resources 
  and human potential. Regional cooperation in science, resource management, and 
  development already are increasing, and access to international markets will 
  diversify economies and increase food security. </p>
<p>This assessment of vulnerability to climate change is marked by uncertainty. 
  The diversity of African climates, high rainfall variability, and a very sparse 
  observational network make predictions of future climate change difficult at 
  the subregional and local level. Underlying exposure and vulnerability to climatic 
  changes are well established. Sensitivity to climatic variations is established 
  but incomplete. However, uncertainty over future conditions means that there 
  is low confidence in projected costs of climate change. This assessment can 
  create the framework for individual states to begin to construct methodologies 
  for estimating such costs, based on their individual circumstances.</p>
