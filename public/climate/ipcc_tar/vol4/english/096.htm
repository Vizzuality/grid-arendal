      <b>Figure 15:</b> Global mean surface temperature anomalies relative to 
      the 1880 to 1920 mean from the instrumental record compared with ensembles 
      of four simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model forced 
      <b>(a)</b> with solar and volcanic forcing only, <b>(b)</b> with anthropogenic 
      forcing including well mixed greenhouse gases, changes in stratospheric 
      and tropospheric ozone and the direct and indirect effects of sulphate aerosols, 
      and <b>(c)</b> with all forcings, both natural and anthropogenic. The thick 
      line shows the instrumental data while the thin lines show the individual 
      model simulations in the ensemble of four members. Note that the data are 
      annual mean values. The model data are only sampled at the locations where 
      there are observations. The changes in sulphate aerosol are calculated interactively, 
      and changes in tropospheric ozone were calculated offline using a chemical 
      transport model. Changes in cloud brightness (the first indirect effect 
      of sulphate aerosols) were calculated by an off line simulation and included 
      in the model. The changes in stratospheric ozone were based on observations. 
      The volcanic and solar forcing were based on published combinations of measured 
      and proxy data. The net anthropogenic forcing at 1990 was 1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
      including a net cooling of 1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to sulphate aerosols. 
      The net natural forcing for 1990 relative to 1860 was 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, 
      and for 1992 was a net cooling of 2.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to Mount Pinatubo. 
      Other models forced with anthropogenic forcing give similar results to those 
      shown in (b). [Based on <a href="../../wg1/450.htm#fig127">Figure

<h2>E.4 New Estimates of Responses to Natural Forcing</h2>
<p><i>Assessments based on physical principles and model simulations indicate 
  that natural forcing alone is unlikely to explain the recent observed global 
  warming or the observed changes in vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere.</i> 
  Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used reconstructions of solar and 
  volcanic forcings over the last one to three centuries to estimate the contribution 
  of natural forcing to climate variability and change. Although the reconstruction 
  of natural forcings is uncertain, including their effects produces an increase 
  in variance at longer (multi-decadal) time-scales. This brings the low-frequency 
  variability closer to that deduced from palaeo-reconstructions. It is likely 
  that the net natural forcing (i.e., solar plus volcanic) has been negative over 
  the past two decades, and possibly even the past four decades. Statistical assessments 
  confirm that simulated natural variability, both internal and naturally forced, 
  is unlikely to explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see 
  <a href="#figTechSum15">Figure 15</a>). However, there is evidence 
  for a detectable volcanic influence on climate and evidence that suggests a 
  detectable solar influence, especially in the early part of the 20th century. 
  Even if the models underestimate the magnitude of the response to solar or volcanic 
  forcing, the spatial and temporal patterns are such that these effects alone 
  cannot explain the observed temperature changes over the 20th century.</p>

<h2>E.5 Sensitivity to Estimates of Climate Change Signals</h2>
<i>There is a wide range of evidence of qualitative consistencies between observed 
climate changes and model responses to anthropogenic forcing. </i>Models and observations 
show increasing global temperature, increasing land-ocean temperature contrast, 
diminishing sea-ice extent, glacial retreat, and increases in precipitation at 
high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Some qualitative inconsistencies remain, 
including the fact that models predict a faster rate of warming in the mid- to 
upper troposphere than is observed in either satellite or radiosonde tropospheric 
temperature records. <br>
<br>
<i>All simulations with greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols that have been 
  used in detection studies have found that a significant anthropogenic contribution 
  is required to account for surface and tropospheric trends over at least the 
  last 30 years.</i> Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in greenhouse 
  gases and some representation of aerosol effects have become available. Several 
  studies have included an explicit representation of greenhouse gases (as opposed 
  to an equivalent increase in CO<sub>2</sub>). Some have also included tropospheric 
  ozone changes, an interactive sulphur cycle, an explicit radiative treatment 
  of the scattering of sulphate aerosols, and improved estimates of the changes 
  in stratospheric ozone. <br>
<br>
Overall, while detection of the climate response to these other anthropogenic 
  factors is often ambiguous, detection of the influence of greenhouse gases on 
  the surface temperature changes over the past 50 years is robust. In some cases, 
  ensembles of simulations have been run to reduce noise in the estimates of the 
  time-dependent response. Some studies have evaluated seasonal variation of the 
  response. Uncertainties in the estimated climate change signals have made it 
  difficult to attribute the observed climate change to one specific combination 
  of anthropogenic and natural influences, but all studies have found a significant 
  anthropogenic contribution is required to account for surface and tropospheric 
  trends over at least the last thirty years.<br><br>
