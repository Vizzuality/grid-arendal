      too little, too much, and too dirty water -- may be exacerbated by climate 
      change. </span>Freshwater is essential for human health, food production, 
      and sanitation, as well as for manufacturing and other industrial uses and 
      sustaining ecosystems. There are several indicators of water resources stress. 
      When withdrawals are greater than 20% of the total renewable resources, 
      water stress often is a limiting factor on development. Withdrawals of 40% 
      or more represent high stress. Similarly, water stress may be a problem 
      if a country or region has less than 1,700 m 3 yr<sup>-1</sup> of water 
      per capita. In the year 1990, approximately one-third of the world's 
      population lived in countries using more than 20% of their water resources, 
      and by the year 2025 about 60% of a larger total would be living in such 
      a stressed country, only because of population growth. Higher temperatures 
      could increase such stress conditions. However, adaptation through appropriate 
      water management practices can reduce the adverse impacts. While climate 
      change is just one of the stresses on water resources in this increasingly 
      populated world, it is clear that it is an important one (see Table 8-2). 
      The TAR projections using the SRES scenarios of future climate indicate 
      a tendency for increased flood and drought risks for many areas under most 
      scenarios. Decreases of water availability in parts of a warmer world are 
      projected in areas like southern Africa and countries around the Mediterranean. 
      Because of sea-level rise, many coastal systems will experience saltwater 
      intrusion into fresh groundwater and encroachment of tidal water into estuaries 
      and river systems, with consequential effects on freshwater availability.<br>
