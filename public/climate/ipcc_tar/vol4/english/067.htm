          and the options to mitigate and adapt is developed through multi- and 
          interdisciplinary research and monitoring in an integrated assessment 
          framework. </span>As understanding deepens, some findings become more 
          robust and some uncertainties emerge as critical for informed policy 
          formulation. Some uncertainties arise from a lack of data and a lack 
          of understanding of key processes and from disagreement about what is 
          known or even knowable. Other uncertainties are associated with predicting 
          social and personal behavior in response to information and events. 
          The uncertainties tend to escalate with the complexity of the problem, 
          as additional elements are introduced to include a more comprehensive 
          range of physical, technical, social, and political impacts and policy 
          responses. The climate responds to human influence without deliberation 
          or choice; but human society can respond to climate change deliberately, 
          making choices between different options. An objective of the TAR and 
          other IPCC reports is to explore, assess, quantify, and, if possible, 
          reduce these uncertainties.<br>

        is defined as one that holds under a variety of approaches, methods, models, 
        and assumptions and one that is expected to be relatively unaffected by 
        uncertainties.</span> A robust finding can be expected to fall into the 
        categories of <em>well-established </em>(high level of agreement and high 
        amount of evidence) and <em>established but incomplete </em>(high level 
        of agreement, but incomplete evidence) in the literature. Robustness is 
        different from likelihood: A finding that an outcome is "exceptionally 
        unlikely" may be just as robust as the finding that it is "virtually 
        certain." A major development in the TAR is that of the multiple 
        alternative pathways for emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases 
        as represented by the SRES. Robust findings are those that are maintained 
        under a wide range of these possible worlds.<br>

        more of the information that underpins policy making. The uncertainties 
        can never be fully resolved, but often they can be bounded by more evidence

    <td width="75%"> <span class="blue2">The integrated assessment framework described 
      in this report is used to bring together the robust findings and key uncertainties 
      in the model projections.</span> Such a framework can encompass all the 
      disciplines involved in understanding the climate, the biosphere, and human 
      society. It emphasizes the linkages between the systems described in the 
      different Working Group reports of the TAR as well as considers linkages 
      between climate change and other environmental issues, and helps to identify 
      gaps in knowledge. It suggests how key uncertainties can affect the whole 
      picture. <a href="018.htm#figspm11">Figure 1-1</a> shows how 
      adaptation and mitigation can be integrated into the assessment. The human 
      and natural systems will have to adapt to climate change, and development 
      will be affected. The adaptation will be both autonomous and via government 
      initiatives, and adaptation actions will reduce (but cannot entirely avoid) 
      some of the impacts of climate change on these systems and on development. 
      Adaptation actions provide benefits but also entail costs. Mitigation is 
      unlike adaptation in that it reduces emissions at the start of the cycle, 
      it reduces concentrations (compared to what would otherwise occur), and 
      it reduces climate change and the risks and uncertainties associated with 
      climate change. It further reduces the need for adaptation, the impacts 
      of climate change, and effects on socio-economic development. It is also 
      different in that mitigation aims to address the impacts on the climate 
      system, whereas adaptation is primarily oriented to address localized impacts 
      of climate change. The primary benefit of mitigation is avoided climate 
      change, but it also has costs. In addition, mitigation gives rise to ancillary 
      benefits (e.g., reduced air pollution leading to improvements in human health). 
      A fully integrated approach to climate change assessment would consider 
      the whole cycle shown in <a href="018.htm#figspm11">Figure 
      1-1</a> dynamically with all the feedbacks but this could not be accomplished 
      in the TAR.<br>
