<h2>3. Scenarios of Future Change</h2>
<h2><a name="31"></a>3.1. Scenarios and their Role</h2>
<p>A scenario is a coherent, internally consistent, and plausible description 
  of a possible future state of the world. Scenarios are commonly required in 
  climate change impact, adaptation, and vulnerability assessments to provide 
  alternative views of future conditions considered likely to influence a given 
  system or activity. A distinction is made between climate scenarios, which describe 
  the forcing factor of focal interest to the IPCC, and nonclimatic scenarios, 
  which provide the socioeconomic and environmental context within which climate 
  forcing operates. Most assessments of the impacts of future climate change are 
  based on results from impact models that rely on quantitative climate and nonclimatic 
  scenarios as inputs. [<a href="../../wg2/125.htm">3.1.1</a>,  <a href="../../wg2/125.htm#box31">Box 
  3-1</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="32"></a>3.2. Socioeconomic, Land-Use, and Environmental Scenarios</h2>
<p>Nonclimatic scenarios describing future socioeconomic, land-use, and environmental 
  changes are important for characterizing the sensitivity of systems to climate 
  change, their vulnerability, and the capacity for adaptation. Such scenarios 
  only recently have been widely adopted in impact assessments alongside climate 
  scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Socioeconomic scenarios.</i> Socioeconomic scenarios have been used more 
  extensively for projecting GHG emissions than for assessing climate vulnerability 
  and adaptive capacity. Most socioeconomic scenarios identify several different 
  topics or domains, such as population or economic activity, as well as background 
  factors such as the structure of governance, social values, and patterns of 
  technological change. Scenarios make it possible to establish baseline socioeconomic 
  vulnerability, pre-climate change; determine climate change impacts; and assess 
  post-adaptation vulnerability. [<a href="../../wg2/127.htm">3.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Land-use and land-cover change scenarios.</i> Land-use change and land-cover 
  change (LUC-LCC) involve several processes that are central to the estimation 
  of climate change and its impacts. First, LUC-LCC influences carbon fluxes and 
  GHG emissions, which directly alter atmospheric composition and radiative forcing 
  properties. Second, LUC-LCC modifies land-surface characteristics and, indirectly, 
  climatic processes. Third, land-cover modification and conversion may alter 
  the properties of ecosystems and their vulnerability to climate change. Finally, 
  several options and strategies for mitigating GHG emissions involve land cover 
  and changed land-use practices. A great diversity of LUC-LCC scenarios have 
  been constructed. Most of these scenarios do not address climate change issues 
  explicitly, however; they focus on other issues -- for example, food security 
  and carbon cycling. Large improvements have been made since the SAR in defining 
  current and historic land-use and land-cover patterns, as well as in estimating 
  future scenarios. Integrated assessment models currently are the most appropriate 
  tools for developing LUC-LCC scenarios. [<a href="../../wg2/132.htm">3.3.1</a>,  <a href="../../wg2/132.htm#332">3.3.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Environmental scenarios.</i> Environmental scenarios refer to changes in 
  environmental factors other than climate that will occur in the future regardless 
  of climate change. Because these factors could have important roles in modifying 
  the impacts of future climate change, scenarios are required to portray possible 
  future environmental conditions such as atmospheric composition [e.g., carbon 
  dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), tropospheric ozone, acidifying compounds, and ultraviolet-B 
  (UV-B) radiation]; water availability, use, and quality; and marine pollution. 
  Apart from the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, changes in other 
  environmental factors rarely have been considered alongside climate changes 
  in past impact assessments, although their use is increasing with the emergence 
  of integrated assessment methods. [<a href="../../wg2/136.htm">3.4.1</a>]</p>
