<i>Atmospheric methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) concentrations have increased by about 
150% (1,060 ppb) since 1750.</i> The present CH<sub>4</sub> concentration has 
not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is a 
greenhouse gas with both natural (e.g., wetlands) and human-influenced sources 
(e.g., agriculture, natural gas activities, and landfills). Slightly more than 
half of current CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are anthropogenic. It is removed from 
the atmosphere by chemical reactions. As <a href="#figTechSum11">Figure 11</a> 
shows, systematic, globally representative measurements of the concentration of 
CH<sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere have been made since 1983, and the record of 
atmospheric concentrations has been extended to earlier times from air extracted 
from ice cores and firn layers. The current direct radiative forcing of 0.48 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
from CH<sub>4</sub> is 20% of the total from all of the long-lived and globally 
mixed greenhouse gases (see <a href="085.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 9</a>).<br>
<p><i>The atmospheric abundance of CH<sub>4</sub> continues to increase, from 
  about 1,610 ppb in 1983 to 1,745 ppb in 1998, but the observed annual increase 
  has declined during this period.</i> The increase was highly variable during 
  the 1990s; it was near zero in 1992 and as large as 13 ppb during 1998. There 
  is no clear quantitative explanation for this variability. Since the SAR, quantification 
  of certain anthropogenic sources of CH<sub>4</sub>, such as that from rice production, 
  has improved.</p>
<p><i>The rate of increase in atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> is due to a small imbalance 
  between poorly characterised sources and sinks, which makes the prediction of 
  future concentrations problematic.</i> Although the major contributors to the 
  global CH<sub>4</sub> budget likely have been identified, most of them are quite 
  uncertain quantitatively because of the difficulty in assessing emission rates 
  of highly variable biospheric sources. The limitations of poorly quantified 
  and characterised CH<sub>4</sub> source strengths inhibit the prediction of 
  future CH<sub>4</sub> atmospheric concentrations (and hence its contribution 
  to radiative forcing) for any given anthropogenic emission scenario, particularly 
  since both natural emissions and the removal of CH<sub>4</sub> can be influenced 
  substantially by climate change.</p>

<h3>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</h3>
<i>The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has steadily 
increased during the Industrial Era and is now 16% (46 ppb) larger than in 1750.</i> 
The present N<sub>2</sub>O concentration has not been exceeded during at least 
the past thousand years. Nitrous oxide is another greenhouse gas with both natural 
and anthropogenic sources, and it is removed from the atmosphere by chemical reactions. 
Atmospheric concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O continue to increase at a rate of 
0.25%/yr (1980 to 1998). Significant interannual variations in the upward trend 
of N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations are observed, e.g., a 50% reduction in annual 
growth rate from 1991 to 1993. Suggested causes are several-fold: a decrease in 
use of nitrogen-based fertiliser, lower biogenic emissions, and larger stratospheric 
losses due to volcanic-induced circulation changes. Since 1993, the growth of 
N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations has returned to rates closer to those observed during 
the 1980s. While this observed multi-year variance has provided some potential 
insight into what processes control the behaviour of atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O, 
the multi-year trends of this greenhouse gas remain largely unexplained.<br>
<p><i>The global budget of nitrous oxide is in better balance than in the SAR, 
  but uncertainties in the emissions from individual sources are still quite large.</i> 
  Natural sources of N<sub>2</sub>O are estimated to be approximately 10 TgN/yr 
  (1990), with soils being about 65% of the sources and oceans about 30%. New, 
  higher estimates of the emissions from anthropogenic sources (agriculture, biomass 
  burning, industrial activities, and livestock management) of approximately 7 
  TgN/yr have brought the source/sink estimates closer in balance, compared with 
  the SAR. However, the predictive understanding associated with this significant, 
  long-lived greenhouse gas has not improved significantly since the last assessment. 
  The radiative forcing is estimated at 0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 6% of the 
  total from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases (see <a href="085.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 
  9</a>).</p>
<a name="halocarbons"></a> 
<h3>Halocarbons and related compounds</h3>
<p><i>The atmospheric concentrations of many of those gases that are both ozone-depleting 
  and greenhouse gases are either decreasing (CFC-11, CFC-113, CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> 
  and CCl<sub>4</sub>) or increasing more slowly (CFC-12) in response to reduced 
  emissions under the regulations of the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments. 
  Many of these halocarbons are also radiatively effective, long-lived greenhouse 
  gases.</i> Halocarbons are carbon compounds that contain fluorine, chlorine, 
  bromine or iodine. For most of these compounds, human activities are the sole 
  source. Halocarbons that contain chlorine (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs) 
  and bromine (e.g., halons) cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer 
  and are controlled under the Montreal Protocol. The combined tropospheric abundance 
  of ozone-depleting gases peaked in 1994 and is slowly declining. The atmospheric 
  abundances of some of the major greenhouse halocarbons have peaked, as shown 
  for CFC-11 in <a href="#figTechSum12">Figure 12</a>. The concentrations of CFCs 
  and chlorocarbons in the troposphere are consistent with reported emissions. 
  Halocarbons contribute a radiative forcing of 0.34 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 
  14% of the radiative forcing from all of the globally mixed greenhouse gases 
  (<a href="085.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 9</a>).</p>
 
<p><i>The observed atmospheric concentrations of the substitutes for the CFCs 
  are increasing, and some of these compounds are greenhouse gases. </i>The abundances 
  of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are increasing 
  as a result of continuation of earlier uses and of their use as substitutes 
  for the CFCs. For example, the concentration of HFC-23 has increased by more 
  than a factor of three between 1978 and 1995. Because current concentrations 
  are relatively low, the present contribution of HFCs to radiative forcing is 
  relatively small. The present contribution of HCFCs to radiative forcing is 
  also relatively small, and future emissions of these gases are limited by the 
  Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p><i>The perfluorocarbons (PFCs, e.g., CF<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>) 
  and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) have anthropogenic sources, have extremely 
  long atmospheric residence times, and are strong absorbers of infrared radiation.</i> 
  Therefore, these compounds, even with relatively small emissions, have the potential 
  to influence climate far into the future. Perfluoromethane (CF<sub>4</sub>) 
  resides in the atmosphere for at least 50,000 years. It has a natural background; 
  however, current anthropogenic emissions exceed natural ones by a factor of 
  1,000 or more and are responsible for the observed increase. Sulphur hexafluoride 
  (SF<sub>6</sub>) is 22,200 times more effective a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub> 
  on a per-kg basis. The current atmospheric concentrations are very small (4.2 
  ppt), but have a significant growth rate (0.24 ppt/yr). There is good agreement 
  between the observed atmospheric growth rate of SF<sub>6</sub> and the emissions 
  based on revised sales and storage data.</p>
