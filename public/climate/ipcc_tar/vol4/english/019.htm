      <p>This answer focuses on classical measures of climate (e.g., temperature, 
        precipitation, sea level, plus extreme events including floods, droughts, 
        and storms), on other components of the Earth's climate system (e.g., 
        greenhouse gases and aerosols, ecological systems), and on human health 
        and socio-economic sectors. Climate <em>change</em> as defined in IPCC 
        refers to statistically significant variations that persist for an extended 
        period, typically decades or longer. It includes shifts in the frequency 
        and magnitude of sporadic weather events as well as the slow continuous 
        rise in global mean surface temperature. Thus the discussion here includes 
        climate-weather variations on all temporal and spatial scales, ranging 
        from brief-lived severe storms to seasonal El Ni&ntilde;o events, decadal 
        droughts, and century shifts in temperature and ice cover. Although short-term 
        climate variations are considered predominantly natural at present, their 
        impacts are discussed in this question because they represent a class 
        of changes that may become more prevalent in a future climate perturbed 
        by human activities (see <a href="037.htm">Question 4</a>). 
        Attribution is used here as the process of establishing the most likely 
        causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence. 
        The discussion includes both climate change that is attributable to human 
        influence and climate change that may at present be natural but might 
        in the future be modified through human influence (see <a href="026.htm#box31">Box 
        3-1</a>).<br>

        gases and their radiative forcings have generally increased over the 20th 
        century as a result of human activities.</span> Almost all greenhouse 
        gases reached their highest recorded levels in the 1990s and continue 
        to increase (see <a href="021.htm#figspm21">Figure 2-1</a>). 
        Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) 
        have varied substantially during glacial-interglacial cycles over the 
        past 420,000 years, but even the largest of these earlier values are much 
        less than their current atmospheric concentrations. In terms of radiative 
        forcing by greenhouse gases emitted through human activity, CO<sub>2</sub> 
        and CH<sub>4</sub> are the first and second most important, respectively. 
        From the years 1750 to 2000, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> increased 
        by 31&plusmn;4%, and that of CH<sub>4</sub> rose by 151&plusmn;25% (see 
        <a href="019.htm#box2-1">Box 2-1</a>and <a href="021.htm#figspm21">Figure 
        2-1</a>). These rates of increase are unprecedented. Fossil-fuel burning 
        released on average 5.4 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1980s, increasing 
        to 6.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1990s. About three-quarters of 
        the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during the 1990s was caused 
        by fossil-fuel burning, with land-use change including deforestation responsible 
        for the rest. Over the 19th and much of the 20th century the terrestrial 
        biosphere has been a net source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, but before 
        the end of the 20th century it had become a net sink. The increase in 
        CH<sub>4</sub> can be identified with emissions from energy use, livestock, 
        rice agriculture, and landfills. Increases in the concentrations of other 
        greenhouse gases -- particularly tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), 
        the third most important -- are directly attributable to fossil-fuel 
        combustion as well as other industrial and agricultural emissions.<br>
