<h2>5.3 Sector- and Technology-specific Barriers and Opportunities</h2>
<p>The following sections describe barriers and opportunities particular to each 
  mitigation sector (see also <a href="174.htm">Table TS.2</a>). </p>
<p><i>Buildings:</i> The poor in every country are affected far more by barriers 
  in this sector than the rich, because of inadequate access to financing, low 
  literacy rates, adherence to traditional customs, and the need to devote a higher 
  fraction of their income to satisfy basic needs, including fuel purchases. Other 
  barriers in this sector are lack of skills and social barriers, misplaced incentives, 
  market structure, slow stock turnover, administratively set prices, and imperfect 
  information. Integrated building design for residential construction could lead 
  to energy saving by 40%-60%, which in turn could reduce the cost of living (<a href="175.htm#334">Section 
  3.3.4</a>). </p>
<p>Policies, programmes, and measures to remove barriers and reduce energy costs, 
  energy use, and carbon emissions in residential and commercial buildings fall 
  into ten general categories: voluntary programmes, building efficiency standards, 
  equipment efficiency standards, state market transformation programmes, financing, 
  government procurement, tax credits, energy planning (production, distribution, 
  and end-use), and accelerated R&amp;D. Affordable credit financing is widely 
  recognized in Africa as one of the critical measures to remove the high first-cost 
  barrier. Poor macroeconomic management captured by unstable economic conditions 
  often leads to financial repression and higher barriers. As many of several 
  obstacles can be observed simultaneously in the innovation chain of an energy-efficient 
  investment or organizational measure, policy measures usually have to be applied 
  as a bundle to realize the economic potential of a particular technology.</p>
<p><i>Transport:</i> The car has come to be widely perceived in modern societies 
  as a means of freedom, mobility and safety, a symbol of personal status and 
  identity, and as one of the most important products in the industrial economy. 
  Several studies have found that people living in denser and more compact cities 
  rely less on cars, but it is not easy, even taking congestion problems into 
  account, to motivate the shift away from suburban sprawl to compact cities as 
  advocated in some literature. An integrated approach to town and transport planning 
  and the use of incentives are key to energy efficiency and saving in the transport 
  sector. This is an area, where lock-in effects are very important: when land-use 
  patterns have been chosen there is hardly a way back. This represents an opportunity 
  in particular for the developing world.</p>
<p>Transport fuel taxes are commonly used, but have proved very unpopular in some 
  countries, especially where they are seen as revenue-raising measures. Charges 
  on road users have been accepted where they are earmarked to cover the costs 
  of transport provision. Although trucks and cars may be subject to different 
  barriers and opportunities because of differences in their purpose of use and 
  travel distance, a tax policy that assesses the full cost of GHG emissions would 
  result in a similar impact on CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in road transport. Several 
  studies have explored the potential for adjusting the way existing road taxes, 
  licence fees, and insurance premiums are levied and have found potential emissions 
  reductions of around 10% in OECD countries. Inadequate development and provision 
  of convenient and efficient mass transport systems encourage the use of more 
  energy consuming private vehicles. It is the combination of policies protecting 
  road transport interest, however, that poses the greatest barrier to change, 
  rather than any single type of instrument.</p>
<p>New and used vehicles and/or their technologies mostly flow from the developed 
  to developing countries. Hence, a global approach to reducing emissions that 
  targets technology in developed countries would have a significant impact on 
  future emissions from developing countries.</p>
<p><i>Industry:</i> In industry, barriers may take many forms, and are determined 
  by the characteristics of the firm (size and structure) and the business environment. 
  Cost-effective energy efficiency measures are often not undertaken as a result 
  of lack of information and high transaction costs for obtaining reliable information. 
  Capital is used for competing investment priorities, and is subject to high 
  hurdle rates for energy efficiency investments. Lack of skilled personnel, especially 
  for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), leads to difficulties installing 
  new energy-efficient equipment compared to the simplicity of buying energy. 
  Other barriers are the difficulty of quantifying energy savings and slow diffusion 
  of innovative technology into markets, while at the same time firms typically 
  underinvest in R&amp;D, despite the high rates of return on investment.</p>
<p>A wide array of policies to reduce barriers, or the perception of barriers, 
  has been used and tested in the industrial sector in developed countries, with 
  varying success rates. Information programmes are designed to assist energy 
  consumers in understanding and employing technologies and practices to use energy 
  more efficiently. Forms of environmental legislation have been a driving force 
  in the adoption of new technologies. New approaches to industrial energy efficiency 
  improvement in developed countries include voluntary agreements (VAs). </p>
<p>In the energy supply sector virtually all the generic barriers cited in <a href="181.htm">Section 
  5.2</a> restrict the introduction of environmentally sound technologies and 
  practices. The increasing deregulation of energy supply, while making it more 
  efficient, has raised particular concerns. Volatile spot and contract prices, 
  short-term outlook of private investors, and the perceived risks of nuclear 
  and hydropower plants have shifted fuel and technology choice towards natural 
  gas and oil plants, and away from renewable energy, including - to a lesser 
  extent - hydropower, in many countries. </p>
<p>Co-generation or combined production of power and heat (CHP) is much more efficient 
  than the production of energy for each of these uses alone. The implementation 
  of CHP is closely linked to the availability and density of industrial heat 
  loads, district heating, and cooling networks. Yet, its implementation is hampered 
  by lack of information, the decentralized character of the technology, the attitude 
  of grid operators, the terms of grid connection, and a lack of policies that 
  foster long-term planning. Firm public policy and regulatory authority is necessary 
  to install and safeguard harmonized conditions, transparency, and unbundling 
  of the main power supply functions.</p>
<p><i>Agriculture and Forestry:</i> Lack of adequate capacity for research and 
  provision of extension services will hamper the spread of technologies that 
  suit local conditions, and the declining Consultative Group on International 
  Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system has exacerbated this problem in the developing 
  world. Adoption of new technology is also limited by small farm size, credit 
  constraints, risk aversion, lack of access to information and human capital, 
  inadequate rural infrastructure and tenurial arrangements, and unreliable supply 
  of complementary inputs. Subsidies for critical inputs to agriculture, such 
  as fertilizers, water supply, and electricity and fuels, and to outputs in order 
  to maintain stable agricultural systems and an equitable distribution of wealth 
  distort markets for these products. </p>
<p>Measures to address the above barriers include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The expansion of credit and savings schemes;</li>
  <li>Shifts in international research funding towards water-use efficiency, irrigation 
    design, irrigation management, adaptation to salinity, and the effect of increased 
    CO<sub>2</sub> levels on tropical crops;</li>
  <li>The improvement of food security and disaster early warning systems; </li>
  <li>The development of institutional linkages between countries; and</li>
  <li>The rationalization of input and output prices of agricultural commodities, 
    taking DES issues into consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The forestry sector faces land-use regulation and other macroeconomic policies 
  that usually favour conversion to other land uses such as agriculture, cattle 
  ranching, and urban industry. Insecure land tenure regimes and tenure rights 
  and subsidies favouring agriculture or livestock are among the most important 
  barriers for ensuring sustainable management of forests as well as sustainability 
  of carbon abatement. In relation to climate change mitigation, other issues, 
  such as lack of technical capability, lack of credibility about the setting 
  of project baselines, and monitoring of carbon stocks, poses difficult challenges. 
</p>
<p><i>Waste Management:</i> Solid waste and wastewater disposal and treatment 
  represent about 20% of human-induced methane emissions. The principal barriers 
  to technology transfer in this sector include limited financing and institutional 
  capability, jurisdictional complexity, and the need for community involvement. 
  Climate change mitigation projects face further barriers resulting from unfamiliarity 
  with CH<sub>4</sub> capture and potential electricity generation, unwillingness 
  to commit additional human capacity for climate mitigation, and the additional 
  institutional complexity required not only by waste treatment but also byenergy 
  generation and supply. The lack of clear regulatory and investment frameworks 
  can pose significant challenges for project development.</p>
<p>To overcome the barriers and to avail the opportunities in waste management, 
  it is necessary to have a multi-project approach, the components of which include 
  the following :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building databases on availability of wastes, their characteristics, distribution, 
    accessibility, current practices of utilization and/or disposal technologies, 
    and economic viability;</li>
  <li>Institutional mechanism for technology transfer though a co-ordinated programme 
    involving the R&amp;D institutions, financing agencies, and industry; and</li>
  <li>Defining the role of stakeholders including local authorities, individual 
    householders, industries, R&amp;D institutions, and the government.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Regional Considerations:</i> Changing global patterns provide an opportunity 
  for introducing GHG mitigation technologies and practices that are consistent 
  with DES goals. A culture of energy subsidies, institutional inertia, fragmented 
  capital markets, vested interests, etc., however, presents major barriers to 
  their implementation, and may be particular issues in developing and EIT countries. 
  Situations in these two groups of countries call for a more careful analysis 
  of trade, institutional, financial, and income barriers and opportunities, distorted 
  prices, and information gaps. In the developed countries, other barriers such 
  as the current carbon-intensive lifestyle and consumption patterns, social structures, 
  network externalities, and misplaced incentives offer opportunities for intervention 
  to control the growth of GHG emissions. Lastly, new and used technologies mostly 
  flow from the developed to developing and transitioning countries. A global 
  approach to reducing emissions that targets technology that is transferred from 
  developed to developing countries could have a significant impact on future 
  emissions.</p>
