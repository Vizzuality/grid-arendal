There are 44 regional studies of over 400 plants and animals, which varied in 
length from about 20 to 50 years,
mainly from North America, Europe, and the southern polar region. There are 16 
regional studies covering about
100 physical processes over most regions of the world, which varied in length 
from about 20 to 150 years.
<p> <b><a name="2"></a>2 </b>Projections of changes in climate variability, 
  extreme events, and abrupt/non-linear changes are covered in <a href="037.htm" target="_blank">Question 
  4</a>. 
<p>
<b><a name="3"></a>3</b> Eight studies have modeled the effects of climate change 
on these diseases -- five on malaria and three on dengue.
Seven use a biological or process-based approach, and one uses an empirical, statistical 
approach.
<p> <b><a name="4"></a>4</b> The equilibrium global mean temperature 
  response to doubling atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is often used as a measure of 
  climate sensitivity. The temperatures shown in <a href="012.htm#figspm6" target="_blank">Figures 
  SPM-6</a> and <a href="012.htm#figspm7" target="_blank">SPM-7</a> are derived 
  from a simple model calibrated to give the same response as a number of complex 
  models that have climate sensitivities ranging from 1.7 to 4.2&deg;C. This range 
  is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C. 
<p>
<b><a name="5"></a>5 </b>For all these scenarios, the contribution to the equilibrium 
warming from other greenhouse gases and aerosols is
0.6&deg;C for a low climate sensitivity and 1.4&deg;C for a high climate sensitivity. 
The accompanying increase in radiative
forcing is equivalent to that occurring with an additional 28% in the final CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
<p> <b><a name="6"></a>6 </b>The SAR described two categories of 
  approaches to estimating costs: bottom-up approaches, which build up from assessments 
  of specific technologies and sectors, and top-down modeling studies, which proceed 
  from macro-economic relationships. See <a href="051.htm#tab7-1" target="_blank">Box 
  7-1</a> in the underlying report. 
<p>
<b><a name="7"></a>7 </b>A market-based approach to achieving environmental objectives 
that allows those reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, below what is required, to use or trade the excess reductions to offset 
emissions at another source
inside or outside the country. Here the term is broadly used to include trade 
in emission allowances, and project-based
collaboration.<p>
<b><a name="8"></a>8 </b>The emissions reduction estimates are with reference 
to a baseline trend that is similar in magnitude to the SRES
B2 scenario.<p>
<b><a name="9"></a>9 </b>Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. 
Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released
by historical land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere 
over the course of the century (e.g.,
by reforestation), CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm.<p>
<b><a name="10"></a>10 </b>The calculated GDP reductions are relative to each 
model's projected GDP baseline. The models evaluated only
reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> . In contrast, the estimates cited from the bottom-up analyses 
above included all greenhouse
gases. Many metrics can be used to present costs. For example, if the annual costs 
to developed countries
associated with meeting Kyoto targets with full Annex B trading are in the order 
of 0.5% of GDP, this represents
US$125 billion (1,000 million) per year, or US$125 per person per year by 2010 
in Annex II (SRES assumptions).
This corresponds to an impact on economic growth rates over 10 years of less than 
0.1 percentage point.<p>
<b><a name="11"></a>11 </b>These spill-over effects incorporate only economic 
effects, not environmental effects.<p>
<b><a name="12"></a>12 </b>These estimated costs can be expressed as differences 
in GDP growth rates over the period 2000-2010. With no
emissions trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points per year; 
with Annex B emissions
trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage points per year.<p>
<b><a name="13"></a>13 </b>Carbon leakage is defined here as the increase in emissions 
in non-Annex B countries due to implementation of
reductions in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of Annex B reductions.

  6</a> for discussion of impacts of climate change. <!-- #EndEditable -->
