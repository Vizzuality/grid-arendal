      resistance to change in its vicinity, can be affected by the rate at which 
      the threshold is approached.</span> Model results indicate that a threshold 
      may exist in the ocean thermohaline circulation (see <a href="037.htm">Question 
      4</a>) such that a transition to a new ocean circulation, as occurred during 
      the emergence from the last glacial period, could be induced if the world 
      warms rapidly. While such a transition is very unlikely during the 21st 
      century, some models suggest that it would be irreversible (i.e., the new 
      circulation would persist even after the perturbation disappeared). For 
      slower rates of warming, THC would likely gradually adjust and thresholds 
      may not be crossed. This implies that the greenhouse gas emission trajectory 
      is important in determining the evolution of THC. When a system approaches 
      a threshold, as is the case for a weakening THC under global warming, resilience 
      to perturbations decreases.<br>

      effects of multiple stresses increase the likelihood of a threshold crossing. 
      </span>An example of an ecological threshold is provided by the migration 
      of plant species as they respond to a changing climate. Fossil records indicate 
      that the maximum rate at which most plant species have migrated in the past 
      is about 1 km per year. Known constraints imposed by the dispersal process 
      (e.g., the mean period between germination and the production of seeds, 
      and the mean distance that an individual seed can travel) suggest that, 
      without human intervention, many species would not be able to keep up with 
      the rate of movement of their preferred climatic niche projected for the 
      21st century, even if there were no barriers to their movement imposed by 
      land use. An example of a socio-economic threshold is provided by conflicts 
      in already stressed situations -- for example, a river basin shared by 
      several nations with competition for a limited water resource. Further pressure 
      from an environmental stress such as reduced stream flow could trigger more 
      severe conflict. If impacted systems are not fully understood, the presence 
      of a threshold may not be apparent until it is reached. <br> <br> </td>
