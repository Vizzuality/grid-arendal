<h2>4.4. Coastal Zones and Marine Ecosystems </h2>
<p><i>Global climate change will result in increases in sea-surface temperature 
  (SST) and sea level; decreases in sea-ice cover; and changes in salinity, wave 
  climate, and ocean circulation.</i> Some of these changes already are taking 
  place. Changes in oceans are expected to have important feedback effects on 
  global climate and on the climate of the immediate coastal area (see <a href="../../wg1/index.htm">TAR 
  WGI</a>). They also would have profound impacts on the biological production 
  of oceans, including fish production. For instance, changes in global water 
  circulation and vertical mixing will affect the distribution of biogenic elements 
  and the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by the ocean; changes in upwelling 
  rates would have major impacts on coastal fish production and coastal climates. 
  [<a href="../../wg2/287.htm">6.3</a>]</p>
<p><i>If warm events associated with El Ni&ntilde;os increase in frequency, plankton 
  biomass and fish larvae abundance would decline and adversely impact fish, marine 
  mammals, seabirds, and ocean biodiversity (high confidence).</i> In addition 
  to El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, the persistence of 
  multi-year climate-ocean regimes and switches from one regime to another have 
  been recognized since the SAR. Changes in recruitment patterns of fish populations 
  have been linked to such switches. Fluctuations in fish abundance are increasingly 
  regarded as biological responses to medium-term climate fluctuations in addition 
  to overfishing and other anthropogenic factors. Similarly, survival of marine 
  mammals and seabirds also is affected by interannual and longer term variability 
  in several oceanographic and atmospheric properties and processes, especially 
  in high latitudes. [<a href="../../wg2/289.htm#634">6.3.4</a>]</p>
<p><i>Growing recognition of the role of the climate-ocean system in the management 
  of fish stocks is leading to new adaptive strategies that are based on the determination 
  of acceptable removable percentages of fish and stock resilience.</i> Another 
  consequence of the recognition of climate-related changes in the distribution 
  of marine fish populations suggests that the sustainability of many nations' 
  fisheries will depend on adaptations that increase flexibility in bilateral 
  and multilateral fishing agreements, coupled with international stock assessments 
  and management plans. Creating sustainable fisheries also depends on understanding 
  synergies between climate-related impacts on fisheries and factors such harvest 
  pressure and habitat conditions. [<a href="../../wg2/289.htm#634">6.3.4</a>, 
   <a href="../../wg2/302.htm#664">6.6.4</a>]</p>
<p><i>Adaptation by expansion of marine aquaculture may partly compensate for 
  potential reductions in ocean fish catch.</i> Marine aquaculture production 
  has more than doubled since 1990, and in 1997 represented approximately 30% 
  of total commercial fish and shellfish production for human consumption. However, 
  future aquaculture productivity may be limited by ocean stocks of herring, anchovies, 
  and other species that are used to provide fishmeal and fish oils to feed cultured 
  species, which may be negatively impacted by climate change. Decreases in dissolved 
  oxygen levels associated with increased seawater temperatures and enrichment 
  of organic matter creates conditions for the spread of diseases in wild and 
  aquaculture fisheries, as well as outbreaks of algal blooms in coastal areas. 
  Pollution and habitat destruction that can accompany aquaculture also may place 
  limits on its expansion and on the survival success of wild stocks. [<a href="../../wg2/290.htm#635">6.3.5</a>]</p>
<p><i>Many coastal areas already are experiencing increased levels of sea flooding, 
  accelerated coastal erosion, and seawater intrusion into freshwater sources; 
  these processes will be exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise.</i> 
  Sea-level rise in particular has contributed to erosion of sandy and gravel 
  beaches and barriers; loss of coastal dunes and wetlands; and drainage problems 
  in many low-lying, mid-latitude coastal areas. Highly diverse and productive 
  coastal ecosystems, coastal settlements, and island states will continue to 
  be exposed to pressures whose impacts are expected to be largely negative and 
  potentially disastrous in some instances. [<a href="../../wg2/292.htm">6.4</a>]</p>
<p><i>Low-latitude tropical and subtropical coastlines, particularly in areas 
  where there is significant human population pressure, are highly susceptible 
  to climate change impacts.</i> These impacts will exacerbate many present-day 
  problems. For instance, human activities have increased land subsidence in many 
  deltaic regions by increasing subsurface water withdrawals, draining wetland 
  soils, and reducing or cutting off riverine sediment loads. Problems of inundation, 
  salinization of potable groundwater, and coastal erosion will all be accelerated 
  with global sea-level rise superimposed on local submergence. Especially at 
  risk are large delta regions of Asia and small islands whose vulnerability was 
  recognized more than a decade ago and continues to increase. [<a href="../../wg2/294.htm#643">6.4.3</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/298.htm#653">6.5.3</a>]</p>
<p><i>High-latitude (polar) coastlines also are susceptible to climate warming 
  impacts, although these impacts have been less studied.</i> Except on rock-dominated 
  or rapidly emerging coasts, a combination of accelerated sea-level rise, more 
  energetic wave climate with reduced sea-ice cover, and increased ground temperatures 
  that promote thaw of permafrost and ground ice (with consequent volume loss 
  in coastal landforms) will have severe impacts on settlements and infrastructure 
  and will result in rapid coastal retreat. [<a href="../../wg2/296.htm#646">6.4.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs and atolls, salt marshes and mangrove 
  forests, and submergered aquatic vegetation will be impacted by sea-level rise, 
  warming SSTs, and any changes in storm frequency and intensity.</i> Impacts 
  of sea-level rise on mangroves and salt marshes will depend on the rate of rise 
  relative to vertical accretion and space for horizontal migration, which can 
  be limited by human development in coastal areas. Healthy coral reefs are likely 
  to be able to keep up with sea-level rise, but this is less certain for reefs 
  degraded by coral bleaching, UV-B radiation, pollution, and other stresses. 
  Episodes of coral bleaching over the past 20 years have been associated with 
  several causes, including increased ocean temperatures. Future sea-surface warming 
  would increase stress on coral reefs and result in increased frequency of marine 
  diseases (high confidence). Changes in ocean chemistry resulting from higher 
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels may have a negative impact on coral reef development and 
  health, which would have a detrimental effect on coastal fisheries and on social 
  and economic uses of reef resources. [<a href="../../wg2/294.htm#644">6.4.4</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/295.htm#645">6.4.5</a>]</p>
<p>Few studies have examined potential changes in prevailing ocean wave heights 
  and directions and storm waves and surges as a consequence of climate change. 
  Such changes can be expected to have serious impacts on natural and human-modified 
  coasts because they will be superimposed on a higher sea level than at present. 
</p>
<p><i>Vulnerabilities have been documented for a variety of coastal settings, 
  initially by using a common methodology developed in the early 1990s.</i> These 
  and subsequent studies have confirmed the spatial and temporal variability of 
  coastal vulnerability at national and regional levels. Within the common methodology, 
  three coastal adaptation strategies have been identified: protect, accommodate, 
  and retreat. Since the SAR, adaptation strategies for coastal zones have shifted 
  in emphasis away from hard protection structures (e.g., seawalls, groins) toward 
  soft protection measures (e.g., beach nourishment), managed retreat, and enhanced 
  resilience of biophysical and socioeconomic systems, including the use of flood 
  insurance to spread financial risk. [<a href="../../wg2/300.htm#661">6.6.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/301.htm#662">6.6.2</a>]</p>
<p>Integrated assessments of coastal zones and marine ecosystems and better understanding 
  of their interaction with human development and multi-year climate variability 
  could lead to improvements in sustainable development and management. Adaptation 
  options for coastal and marine management are most effective when they are incorporated 
  with policies in other areas, such as disaster mitigation plans and land-use 
  plans. </p>
