1. </b>Conditions that justify the adoption of precautionary measures are described 
in Article 3.3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).&nbsp; 
<p><b><a name="2"></a> 2. </b>The risk associated with an event 
  is most simply defined as the probability of that event, multiplied by the magnitude 
  of its consequence. Various decision frameworks can facilitate climate risk 
  assessment and management. These include, among others, cost-benefit analysis, 
  cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-attribute analysis, and tolerable windows. 
  Such techniques help to differentiate the risk levels associated with alternative 
  futures, but in all cases the analyses are marked by considerable uncertainties.&nbsp; 
<p><strong><a name="3"></a> 3. </strong>There are 44 regional studies of over 
  400 plants and animals, which varied in length from about 20 to 50 years, mainly 
  from North America, Europe, and the southern polar region. There are 16 regional 
  studies covering about 100 physical processes over most regions of the world, 
  which varied in length from about 20 to 150 years.
<p><a name="4"></a><strong> 4. </strong>Complex physically based climate models 
  are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to explore 
  the range of scenarios, these are complemented by simple climate models calibrated 
  to yield an equivalent response in temperature and sea level to complex climate 
  models. These projections are obtained using a simple climate model whose climate 
  sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of seven complex climate 
  models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 
  4.2°C, which is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. For 
  the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) experiments for the end 
  of the 21st century (years 2071 to 2100) compared with the period 1961 to 1990, 
  the mean warming for SRES scenario A2 is 3.0°C with a range of 1.3 to 4.5°C, 
  while for SRES scenario B2 the mean warming is 2.2°C with a range of 0.9 to 
  3.4°C.
<p><a name="5"></a> <strong>5.</strong> Eight studies have modeled the effects 
  of climate change on these diseases, five on malaria and three on dengue. Seven 
  use a biological or process-based approach, and one uses an empirical, statistical 
  approach.
<p><a name="6"></a> <strong>6.</strong> In these analyses, emissions by developed 
  countries of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and SO<sub>2</sub> are kept constant 
  at their year 1990 values, and halocarbons follow a scenario consistent with 
  the Copenhagen version of the Montreal Protocol. Developing country emissions 
  of CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases are assumed to follow the IS92 
  scenario projections. The temperature projections were made with a simple climate 
  model. The IS92 scenarios are described in the IPCC <em>Special Report on Radiative 
  Forcing of Climate Change</em>.
<p><a name="7"></a> <strong>7.</strong> The equilibrium global mean temperature 
  response to doubling atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is often used as a measure of 
  climate sensitivity. The temperatures shown in <a href="012.htm#figspm6" target="_blank">Figures 
  6-1</a> and <a href="012.htm#figspm7" target="_blank">6-2</a> are derived from 
  a simple model calibrated to give the same response as a number of complex models 
  that have climate sensitivities ranging from 1.7 to 4.2°C. This range is comparable 
  to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. 
<p><a name="8"></a> <strong>8.</strong> For all these scenarios, the contribution 
  to the equilibrium warming from other greenhouse gases and aerosols is 0.6°C 
  for a low climate sensitivity and 1.4°C for a high climate sensitivity. The 
  accompanying increase in radiative forcing is equivalent to that occurring with 
  an additional 28% in the final CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
<p> <a name="9" id="9"></a> <strong>9.</strong> This rate of emission growth closely 
  approximates the IS92a emission scenario. 
<p> <a name="10"></a> <strong>10.</strong> The S and WRE profiles are discussed 
  in the WGI SAR and are described in more detail in IPCC Technical Paper 3.
<p><a name="11"></a> <strong>11.</strong> Climate change impacts will vary by 
  region and sector or system, and the impacts will be influenced by regional 
  and seasonal changes in mean temperature and precipitation, climate variability, 
  the frequencies and intensities of extreme climate events, and sea-level rise. 
  Global mean temperature change is used as a summary measure of the pressures 
  exerted by climate change.
<p><a name="12"></a> <strong>12.</strong> The relationships between mitigation 
  actions themselves and sustainable development and equity are addressed in <a href="051.htm" target="_blank">Question 
  7</a>. The relationships among adaptation, sustainable development, and equity 
  are covered in <a href="026.htm" target="_blank">Question 3</a>. 
<p><a name="13"></a> <strong>13.</strong> Changing land use could influence atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released 
  by historical land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere 
  over the course of the century (e.g., by reforestation), CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm.
<p><a name="14"></a> <strong>14.</strong> This market-based approach to achieve 
  environmental objectives allows those reducing greenhouse gas emissions below 
  what is required to use or trade the excess reductions to offset emissions at 
  another source inside or outside the country. Here the term is broadly used 
  to include trade in emission allowances and project-based collaboration.
<p><a name="15"></a> <strong>15.</strong> The above-referenced models report results 
  for Energy Modeling Forum scenarios examining the benefits of emissions trading. 
  For the analyses reported here, these models exclude sinks, multiple gases, 
  ancillary benefits, macro-economic shocks, and induced technical change, but 
  include lump sum tax revenue recycling. In the model baseline, additional no-regrets 
  options, which are not listed above, are included.
<p><a name="16"></a> <strong>16.</strong> Spill-over effects incorporate only 
  economic, not environmental, effects.
<p><a name="17"></a> <strong>17.</strong> These estimated costs can be expressed 
  as differences in GDP growth rates over the period 2000-2010. With no emissions 
  trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points per year; with 
  Annex B emissions trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage 
  points per year.
<p> <a name="18"></a> <strong>18.</strong> These policies and measures include 
  those for non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases and non-energy sources of all gases; offsets 
  from sinks; industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier of 
  energy services); use of OPEC's market power; and actions (e.g., of Annex B 
  Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In addition, 
  the studies typically do not include the following policies and effects that 
  can reduce the total cost of mitigation: the use of tax revenues to reduce tax 
  burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental ancillary benefits 
  of reductions in fossil-fuel use; and induced technical change from mitigation 
  policies.
<p><a name="19"></a> <strong>19.</strong> Carbon leakage is defined here as the 
  increase in emissions in non-Annex B countries due to implementation of reductions 
  in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of Annex B reductions.
<p><a name="20"></a> <strong>20.</strong> "Known technological options" refer 
  to technologies that exist in operation or pilot plant stage today, as referenced 
  in the mitigation scenarios discussed in this report. It does not include any 
  new technologies that will require drastic technological breakthroughs. In this 
  way it can be considered to be a conservative estimate, considering the length 
  of the scenario period.
<p><a name="21"></a> <strong>21. </strong>The reference to a particular concentration 
  level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabilization at this level.
<p><strong><a name="22"></a> 22.</strong> Approaches to equity have been classified 
  into a variety of categories, including those based on allocation, outcome, 
  process, rights, liability, poverty, and opportunity, reflecting the diverse 
  expectations of fairness used to judge policy processes and the corresponding 
  outcomes.
<p><strong><a name="23"></a> 23.</strong> Emissions from all regions diverge from 
  baselines at some point. Global emissions diverge earlier and to a greater extent 
  as stabilization levels are lower or underlying scenarios are higher. Such scenarios 
  are uncertain, and do not provide information on equity implications and how 
  such changes may be achieved or who may bear any costs incurred.
<p><strong><a name="24"></a> 24.</strong> See above for other aspects of timing 
  of greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
<p><strong><a name="25"></a> 25.</strong> The reference to a particular concentration 
  level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabilization at this level.
<p><strong><a name="26"></a> 26.</strong> These cost estimates in 1998 prices 
  are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to 12%, consistent with public-sector 
  discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly and are often 
  significantly higher.
<p><strong><a name="27"></a> 27.</strong> <em>Annex B countries: </em>Group of 
  countries included in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol that have agreed to a target 
  for their greenhouse gas emissions, including all the Annex I countries (as 
  amended in 1998) but Turkey and Belarus.
<p><strong><a name="28"></a> 28.</strong> <em>Annex I countries: </em>Group of 
  countries included in Annex I to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
  Climate Change, including all developed countries in the the Organisation for 
  Economic Cooperation and Development and those with economies in transition.<!-- #EndEditable -->
