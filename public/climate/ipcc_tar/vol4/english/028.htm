      expansion and loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps. The range of sea-level 
      rise presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m, based on the IS92 scenarios. 
      Despite the higher temperature change projections in this assessment, the 
      sea-level projections are slightly lower, primarily due to the use of improved 
      models, which give a smaller contribution from glaciers and ice sheets.<br>

      <a target="_blank" href="/climate/ipcc/index.htm">SRES</a> 
      scenario A2 and (b) the SRES scenario B2.</strong> Both SRES scenarios show 
      the period 2071 to 2100 relative to the period 1961 to 1990, and were performed 
      by AOGCMs. Scenarios A2 and B2 are shown as no AOGCM runs were available 
      for the other SRES scenarios. The boxes show an analysis of inter-model 
      consistency in regional relative warming (i.e., warming relative to each 
      model's global average warming) for the same scenarios. Regions are 
      classified as showing either agreement on warming in excess of 40% above 
      the global mean annual average (much greater than average warming), agreement 
      on warming greater than the global mean annual average (greater than average 
      warming), agreement on warming less than the global mean annual average 
      (less than average warming), or disagreement amongst models on the magnitude 
      of regional relative warming (inconsistent magnitude of warming). There 
      is also a category for agreement on cooling (this category never occurs). 
      A consistent result from at least seven of the nine models is defined as 
      being necessary for agreement. The global mean annual average warming of 
      the models used span 1.2 to 4.5&deg;C for A2 and 0.9 tO<sub>3</sub>.4&deg;C 
      for B2, and therefore a regional 40% amplification represents warming ranges 
      of 1.7 to 6.3&deg;C for A2 and 1.3 to 4.7&deg;C for B2.</td>
