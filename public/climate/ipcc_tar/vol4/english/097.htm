<h2>E.6 A Wider Range of Detection Techniques</h2>
<a name="temperature"></a> 
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<i>Evidence of a human influence on climate is obtained over a substantially wider 
range of detection techniques.</i> A major advance since the SAR is the increase 
in the range of techniques used and the evaluation of the degree to which the 
results are independent of the assumptions made in applying those techniques. 
There have been studies using pattern correlations, optimal detection studies 
using one or more fixed patterns and time-varying patterns, and a number of other 
techniques. The increase in the number of studies, breadth of techniques, increased 
rigour in the assessment of the role of anthropogenic forcing in climate, and 
the robustness of results to the assumptions made using those techniques, has 
increased the confidence in these aspects of detection and attribution.<br>
<p><i>Results are sensitive to the range of temporal and spatial scales that are 
  considered.</i> Several decades of data are necessary to separate forced signals 
  from internal variability. Idealised studies have demonstrated that surface 
  temperature changes are detectable only on scales in the order of 5,000 km. 
  Such studies show that the level of agreement found between simulations and 
  observations in pattern correlation studies is close to what one would expect 
  in theory.</p>
<p><i>Most attribution studies find that, over the last 50 years, the estimated 
  rate and magnitude of global warming due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse 
  gases alone are comparable with or larger than the observed warming.</i> Attribution 
  studies address the question of "whether the magnitude of the simulated response 
  to a particular forcing agent is consistent with observations". The use of multi-signal 
  techniques has enabled studies that discriminate between the effects of different 
  factors on climate. The inclusion of the time dependence of signals has helped 
  to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic forcings. As more response 
  patterns are included, the problem of degeneracy (different combinations of 
  patterns yielding near identical fits to the observations) inevitably arises. 
  Nevertheless, even with all the major responses that have been included in the 
  analysis, a distinct greenhouse gas signal remains detectable. Furthermore, 
  most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse gases and sulphate 
  aerosols are consistent with observations over this period. The best agreement 
  between model simulations and observations over the last 140 years is found 
  when both anthropogenic and natural factors are included (see <a href="096.htm#figTechSum15">Figure 
  15</a>). These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain 
  the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other forcings 
  have also contributed. Overall, the magnitude of the temperature response to 
  increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is found to be consistent with 
  observations on the scales considered (see <a href="#figTechSum16">Figure 
  16</a>), but there remain discrepies between modelled and observed response 
  to other natural and anthropogenic factors.</p>

      <br> <b>Figure 16:</b> <b>(a)</b> Estimates of the "scaling factors" by 
      which the amplitude of several model-simulated signals must be multiplied 
      to reproduce the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical 
      bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. 
      A range encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude 
      and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding observed 
      change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated 
      signal is not detectable. Signals are defined as the ensemble mean response 
      to external forcing expressed in large-scale (&gt;5,000 km) near-surface 
      temperatures over the 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. 
      The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval 
      obtained with the assumption that the observations consist only of a response 
      to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly 
      less than one (consistent with results from other models), meaning that 
      models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly over predict the 
      observed warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for 
      model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with 
      two cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one 
      of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and GSIO, respectively). 
      All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there 
      is little evidence that models are systematically over- or under predicting 
      the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated 
      GS signals and internal variability are an adequate representation (i.e., 
      that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed 
      residual variability is consistent with this assumption in all but one case 
      (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). One is obliged to make this assumption 
      to include models for which only a simulation of the anthropogenic response 
      is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single signal cases are 
      incomplete since they do not account for uncertainty in the naturally forced 
      response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of confidence with 
      which internal variability, as simulated by these various models, can be 
      rejected as an explanation of recent near-surface temperature change. A 
      more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, 
      which show corresponding scaling factors on individual greenhouse (G), sulphate 
      (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals 
      for those cases in which the relevant simulations have been performed. In 
      these cases, multiple factors are estimated simultaneously to account for 
      uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturally forced response. The uncertainties 
      increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one 
      case (ECHAM3) the model appears to be overestimating the greenhouse response 
      (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but this result 
      is sensitive to which component of the control is used to define the detection 
      space. It is also not known how it would respond to the inclusion of a volcanic 
      signal. In cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 
      and HadCM3), G and S signals remain detectable and consistent with unity 
      independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately 
      (allowing for different errors in S and V responses).<br> <br> <b>(b)</b> 
      Estimated contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based 
      on the results shown in (a), with 5 to 95% confidence intervals. Although 
      the estimates vary depending on which model's signal and what forcing is 
      assumed, and are less certain if more than one signal is estimated, all 
      show a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th 
      century warming. [Based on <a href="../../wg1/463.htm#fig1212">Figure

<p><i>Uncertainties in other forcings that have been included do not prevent identification 
  of the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases over the last 50 years.</i> 
  The sulphate forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this period. Changes 
  in natural forcing during most of this period are also estimated to be negative. 
  Detection of the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases therefore cannot 
  be eliminated either by the uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing or because 
  natural forcing has not been included in all model simulations. Studies that 
  distinguish the separate responses to greenhouse gas, sulphate aerosol and natural 
  forcing produce uncertain estimates of the amplitude of the sulphate aerosol 
  and natural signals, but almost all studies are nevertheless able to detect 
  the presence of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in the recent climate 
  record.</p>
<p><i>The detection and attribution methods used should not be sensitive to errors 
  in the amplitude of the global mean response to individual forcings.</i> In 
  the signal-estimation methods used in this report, the amplitude of the signal 
  is estimated from the observations and not the amplitude of the simulated response. 
  Hence the estimates are independent of those factors determining the simulated 
  amplitude of the response, such as the climate sensitivity of the model used. 
  In addition, if the signal due to a given forcing is estimated individually, 
  the amplitude is largely independent of the magnitude of the forcing used to 
  derive the response. Uncertainty in the amplitude of the solar and indirect 
  sulphate aerosol forcing should not affect the magnitude of the estimated signal.<br>

<h3>Sea level</h3>
<p><i>It is very likely that the 20th century warming has contributed significantly 
  to the observed sea level rise, through thermal expansion of sea water and widespread 
  loss of land ice.</i> Within present uncertainties, observations and models 
  are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea level rise 
  during the 20th century.</p>
