<h3>5.2.2. Ecosystems and Biodiversity</h3>
<p><i>Climate change would exacerbate current threats to biodiversity resulting 
  from land-use/cover change and population pressure in Asia (medium confidence).</i> 
  Risks to Asia's rich array of living species are climbing. As many as 1,250 
  of 15,000 higher plant species are threatened in India. Similar trends are evident 
  in China, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Many species and a large population 
  of many other species in Asia are likely to be exterminated as a result of the 
  synergistic effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation. In desert ecosystems, 
  increased frequency of droughts may result in a decline in local forage around 
  oases, causing mass mortality among local fauna and threatening their existence. 
  With a 1-m rise in sea level, the Sundarbans (the largest mangrove ecosystems) 
  of Bangladesh will completely disappear. [<a href="../../wg2/427.htm#1121">11.2.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/432.htm">11.2.1.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Permafrost degradation resulting from global warming would increase the 
  vulnerability of many climate-dependent sectors affecting the economy in boreal 
  Asia (medium confidence).</i> Pronounced warming in high latitudes of the northern 
  hemisphere could lead to thinning or disappearance of permafrost in locations 
  where it now exists. Large-scale shrinkage of the permafrost region in boreal 
  Asia is likely. Poleward movement of the southern boundary of the sporadic zone 
  also is likely in Mongolia and northeast China. The boundary between continuous 
  and discontinuous (intermittent or seasonal) permafrost areas on the Tibetan 
  Plateau is likely to shift toward the center of the plateau along the eastern 
  and western margins. [<a href="../../wg2/431.htm">11.2.1.5</a>]</p>
<p><i>The frequency of forest fires is expected to increase in boreal Asia (medium 
  confidence).</i> Warmer surface air temperatures, particularly during summer, 
  may create favorable conditions for thunderstorms and associated lightening, 
  which could trigger forest fires in boreal forests more often. Forest fire is 
  expected to occur more frequently in northern parts of boreal Asia as a result 
  of global warming. [<a href="../../wg2/429.htm">11.2.1.3</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="523"></a>5.2.3. Water Resources</h3>
<p><i>Freshwater availability is expected to be highly vulnerable to anticipated 
  climate change (high confidence).</i> Surface runoff increases during winter 
  and summer periods would be pronounced in boreal Asia (medium confidence). Countries 
  in which water use is more than 20% of total potential water resources available 
  are expected to experience severe water stress during drought periods. Surface 
  runoff is expected to decrease drastically in arid and semi-arid Asia under 
  projected climate change scenarios. Climate change is likely to change streamflow 
  volume, as well as the temporal distribution of streamflows throughout the year. 
  With a 2&deg;C increase in air temperature accompanied by a 5-10% decline in 
  precipitation during summer, surface runoff in Kazakhstan would be substantially 
  reduced, causing serious implications for agriculture and livestocks. Water 
  would be a scarce commodity in many south and southeast Asian countries, particularly 
  where reservoir facilities to store water for irrigation are minimal. Growing 
  populations and concentration of populations in urban areas will exert increasing 
  pressures on water availability and water quality. [<a href="../../wg2/438.htm#11231">11.2.3.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="524"></a>5.2.4. Extreme Weather Events</h3>
<p><i>Developing countries of temperate and tropical Asia already are quite vulnerable 
  to extreme climate events such as typhoons/cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate 
  change and variability would exacerbate these vulnerabilities (high confidence).</i> 
  Extreme weather events are known to cause adverse effects in widely separated 
  areas of Asia. There is some evidence of increases in the intensity or frequency 
  of some of these extreme events on regional scales throughout the 20th century. 
  [<a href="../../wg2/417.htm">11.1.2.2</a>, <a href="../../wg2/419.htm">11.1.2.3</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/459.htm#1141">11.4.1</a>]</p>
<p><i>Increased precipitation intensity, particularly during the summer monsoon, 
  could increase flood-prone areas in temperate and tropical Asia. There is potential 
  for drier conditions in arid and semi-arid Asia during summer, which could lead 
  to more severe droughts (medium confidence).</i> Many countries in temperate 
  and tropical Asia have experienced severe droughts and floods frequently in 
  the 20th century. Flash floods are likely to become more frequent in many regions 
  of temperate and tropical Asia in the future. A decrease in return period for 
  extreme precipitation events and the possibility of more frequent floods in 
  parts of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh is projected. [<a href="../../wg2/423.htm">11.1.3.3</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/435.htm">11.2.2.2</a>, <a href="../../wg2/419.htm">11.1.2.3</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/459.htm#1141">11.4.1</a>]</p>
<p>Conversion of forestland to cropland and pasture already is a prime force driving 
  forest loss in tropical and temperate Asian countries. With more frequent floods 
  and droughts, these actions will have far-reaching implications for the environment 
  (e.g., soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, loss of genetic variability in 
  crops, and depletion of water resources). [<a href="../../wg2/425.htm#11141">11.1.4.1</a>]</p>
<p>Tropical cyclones and storm surges continue to take a heavy toll on life and 
  property in India and Bangladesh. An increase in the intensity of cyclones combined 
  with sea-level rise would result in more loss of life and property in low-lying 
  coastal areas in cyclone-prone countries of Asia (medium confidence). The expected 
  increase in the frequency and intensity of climatic extremes will have significant 
  potential effects on crop growth and agricultural production, as well as major 
  economic and environmental implications (e.g., tourism, transportation). [<a href="../../wg2/445.htm">11.2.4.5</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/451.htm">11.2.6.3</a>, <a href="../../wg2/453.htm">11.3</a>]</p>
<p>A wide range of precautionary measures at regional and national levels, including 
  awareness and acceptance of risk factors among regional communities, is warranted 
  to avert or reduce the impacts of disasters associated with more extreme weather 
  events on economic and social structures of countries in temperate and tropical 
  Asia. [<a href="../../wg2/454.htm">11.3.2</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="525"></a>5.2.5. Deltas and Coastal Zones</h3>
<p><i>The large deltas and low-lying coastal areas of Asia would be inundated 
  by sea-level rise (high confidence).</i> Climate-related stresses in coastal 
  areas include loss and salinization of agricultural land as a result of change 
  in sea level and changing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. Estimates 
  of potential land loss resulting from sea-level rise and risk to population 
  displacement provided in <a href="#tabts8">Table TS-8</a> demonstrate 
  the scale of the issue for major low-lying regions of coastal Asia. Currently, 
  coastal erosion of muddy coastlines in Asia is not a result of sea-level rise; 
  it is triggered largely by annual river-borne suspended sediments transported 
  into the ocean by human activities and delta evolution. These actions could 
  exacerbate the impacts of climate change in coastal regions of Asia. [<a href="../../wg2/442.htm">11.2.4.2</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="526"></a>5.2.6. Human Health</h3>
<p><i>Warmer and wetter conditions would increase the potential for higher incidence 
  of heat-related and infectious diseases in tropical and temperate Asia (medium 
  confidence).</i> The rise in surface air temperature and changes in precipitation 
  in Asia will have adverse effects on human health. Although warming would result 
  in a reduction in wintertime deaths in temperate countries, there could be greater 
  frequency and duration of heat stress, especially in megalopolises during summer. 
  Global warming also will increase the incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular 
  diseases in parts of arid and semi-arid Asia and temperate and tropical Asia. 
  Changes in environmental temperature and precipitation could expand vector-borne 
  diseases into temperate and arid Asia. The spread of vector-borne diseases into 
  more northern latitudes may pose a serious threat to human health. Warmer SSTs 
  along Asian coastlines would support higher phytoplankton blooms. These blooms 
  are habitats for infectious bacterial diseases. Waterborne diseases --  including 
  cholera and the suite of diarrheal diseases caused by organisms such as giardia, 
  salmonella, and cryptosporidium -- could become more common in many countries 
  of south Asia in warmer climate. [<a href="../../wg2/447.htm#11251">11.2.5.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/448.htm">11.2.5.2</a>, <a href="../../wg2/449.htm">11.2.5.4</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="527"></a>5.2.7. Adaptive Capacity </h3>
<p>Adaptation to climate change in Asian countries depends on the affordability 
  of adaptive measures, access to technology, and biophysical constraints such 
  as land and water resource availability, soil characteristics, genetic diversity 
  for crop breeding (e.g., crucial development of heat-resistant rice cultivars), 
  and topography. Most developing countries of Asia are faced with increasing 
  population, spread of urbanization, lack of adequate water resources, and environmental 
  pollution, which hinder socioeconomic activities. These countries will have 
  to individually and collectively evaluate the tradeoffs between climate change 
  actions and nearer term needs (such as hunger, air and water pollution, energy 
  demand). Coping strategies would have to be developed for three crucial sectors: 
  land resources, water resources, and food productivity. Adaptation measures 
  that are designed to anticipate the potential effects of climate change can 
  help offset many of the negative effects. [<a href="../../wg2/453.htm#1131">11.3.1</a>]</p>
