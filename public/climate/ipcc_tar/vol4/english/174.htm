    <td><u>Buildings, households and services:</u> Hundreds of technologies 
      and measures exist that can improve the energy efficiency of appliances 
      and equipment as well as building structures in all regions of the world. 
      It is estimated that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from residential buildings 
      in 2010 can be reduced by 325MtC in developed countries and the EIT region 
      at costs ranging from -US$ 250 to -US$ 150/ tC and by 125MtC in developing 
      countries at costs of -US$ 250 to US$ 50/ tC. Similarly, CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions from commercial buildings in 2010 can be reduced by 185MtC in 
      industrialized countries and the EIT region at costs ranging from -US$ 400 
      to -US$ 250/ tC and by 80MtC in developing countries at costs ranging from 
      -US$ 400 to US$ 0/ tC. These savings represent almost 30% of buildings, 
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010 and 2020 compared to a central scenario 
      such as the SRES B2 Marker scenario. <br>
      <br>

    <td> 
      <p><u>Barriers:</u> In developed countries a market structure not conducive 
        to efficiency improvements, misplaced incentives, and lack of information; 
        and in developing countries lack of financing and skills, lack of information, 
        traditional customs, and administered pricing. <br>
        <br>
        <u>Opportunities:</u> Developing better marketing approaches and skills, 
        information- based marketing, voluntary programmes and standards have 
        been shown to overcome barriers in developed countries. Affordable credit 
        skills, capacity building, information base and consumer awareness, standards, 
        incentives for capacity building, and deregulation of the energy industry 
        are ways to address the aforementioned barriers in the developing world.

    <td><u>Service industries:</u> Many will gain output and employment depending 
      on how mitigation policies are implemented, however in general the increases 
      are expected to be small and diffused. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Households and the informal sector:</u> The impact of mitigation on households 
      comes directly through changes in the technology and price of household's 
      use of energy and indirectly through macroeconomic effects on income and 
      employment. An important ancillary benefit is the improvement in indoor 
      and outdoor air quality, particularly in developing countries and cities 
      all over the world. </td>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><u>Transportation:</u> Transportation technology for light- duty vehicles 
      has advanced more rapidly than anticipated in the SAR, as a consequence 
      of international R&amp; D efforts. Hybrid- electric vehicles have already 
      appeared in the market and introduction of fuel cell vehicles by 2003 has 
      been announced by most major manufacturers. The GHG mitigation impacts of 
      technological efficiency improvements will be diminished to some extent 
      by the rebound effect, unless counteracted by policies that effectively 
      increase the price of fuel or travel. In countries with high fuel prices, 
      such as Europe, the rebound effect may be as large as 40%; in countries 
      with low fuel prices, such as the USA, the rebound appears to be no larger 
      than 20%. Taking into account rebound effects, technological measures can 
      reduce GHG emissions by 5%- 15% by 2010 and 15%- 35% by 2020, in comparison 
      to a baseline of continued growth. </td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> Risk to manufacturers of transportation equipment is 
      an important barrier to more rapid adoption of energy efficient technologies 
      in transport. Achieving significant energy efficiency improvements generally 
      requires a "clean sheet" redesign of vehicles, along with multibillion 
      dollar investments in new production facilities. On the other hand, the 
      value of greater efficiency to customers is the difference between the present 
      value of fuel savings and increased purchase price, which net can often 
      be a small quantity. Although markets for transport vehicles are dominated 
      by a very small number of companies in the technical sense, they are nonetheless 
      highly competitive in the sense that strategic errors can be very costly. 
      Finally, many of the benefits of increased energy efficiency accrue in the 
      form of social rather than private benefits. For all these reasons, the 
      risk to manufacturers of sweeping technological change to improve energy 
      efficiency is generally perceived to outweigh the direct market benefits. 
      Enormous public and private investments in transportation infrastructure 
      and a built environment adapted to motor vehicle travel pose significant 
      barriers to changing the modal structure of transportation in many countries.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities:</u> Information technologies are creating new opportunities 
      for pricing some of the external costs of transportation, from congestion 
      to environmental pollution. Implementation of more efficient pricing can 
      provide greater incentives for energy efficiency in both equipment and modal 
      structure. The factors that hinder the adoption of fuel- efficient technologies 
      in transport vehicle markets create conditions under which energy efficiency 
      regulations, voluntary or mandatory, can be effective. Well- formulated 
      regulations eliminate much of the risk of making sweeping technological 
      changes, because all competitors face the same regulations. Study after 
      study has demonstrated the existence of technologies capable of reducing 
      vehicle carbon intensities by up to 50% or in the longer run 100%, approximately 
      cost- effectively. Finally, intensive R&amp;D efforts for light- duty road 
      vehicles have achieved dramatic improvements in hybrid power- train and 
      fuel cell technologies. Similar efforts could be directed at road freight, 
      air, rail, and marine transport technologies, with potentially dramatic 
      pay-offs. <br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td><u>Transportation:</u> Growth in transportation demand is projected to 
      remain, influenced by GHG mitigation policies only in a limited way. Only 
      limited opportunities for replacing fossil carbon based fuels exist in the 
      short to medium term. The main effect of mitigation policies will be to 
      improve energy efficiency in all modes of transportation. </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><u>Industry:</u> Energy efficiency improvement is the main emission reduction 
      option in industry. Especially in industrialized countries much has been 
      done already to improve energy efficiency, but options for further reductions 
      remain. 300 - 500MtC/yr and 700 -1,100MtC/yr can be reduced by 2010 and 
      2020, respectively, as compared to a scenario like SRES B2. The larger part 
      of these options has net negative costs. Non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 
      industry are generally relatively small and can be reduced by over 85%, 
      most at moderate or sometimes even negative costs. </td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> lack of full- cost pricing, relatively low contribution 
      of energy to production costs, lack of information on part of the consumer 
      and producer, limited availability of capital and skilled personnel are 
      the key barriers to the penetration of mitigation technology in the industrial 
      sector in all, but most importantly in developing countries. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities:</u> legislation to address local environmental concerns; 
      voluntary agreements, especially if complemented by government efforts; 
      and direct subsidies and tax credits are approaches that have been successful 
      in overcoming the above barriers. Legislation, including standards, and 
      better marketing are particularly suitable approaches for light industries.<br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td><u>Industry:</u> Mitigation is expected to lead to structural 
      change in manufacturing in Annex I countries (partly caused by changing 
      demands in private consumption), with those sectors supplying energy- saving 
      equipment and low- carbon technologies benefitting and energy- intensive 
      sectors having to switch fuels, adopt new technologies, or increase prices. 
      However, rebound effects may lead to unexpected negative results. </td>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><u>Land- use change and forestry:</u> There are three fundamental ways 
      in which land use or management can mitigate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
      increases: protection, sequestration, and substitution<sup><b>a</b></sup>. 
      These options show different temporal patterns; consequently, the choice 
      of options and their potential effectiveness depend on the target time frame 
      as well as on site productivity and disturbance history. The SAR estimated 
      that globally these measures could reduce atmospheric C by about 83 to 131GtC 
      by 2050 (60 to 87GtC in forests and 23 to 44GtC in agricultural soils). 
      Studies published since then have not substantially revised these estimates. 
      The costs of terrestrial management practices are quite low compared to 
      alternatives, and range from 0 ('win- win' opportunities) to US$ 12/ tC.</td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> to mitigation in land- use change and forestry include 
      lack of funding and of human and institutional capacity to monitor and verify, 
      social constraints such as food supply, people living off the natural forest, 
      incentives for land clearing, population pressure, and switch to pastures 
      because of demand for meat. In tropical countries, forestry activities are 
      often dominated by the state forest departments with a minimal role for 
      local communities and the private sector. In some parts of the tropical 
      world, particularly Africa, low crop productivity and competing demands 
      on forests for crop production and fuelwood are likely to reduce mitigation 
      opportunities.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities:</u> in land use and forestry, incentives and policies 
      are required to realize the technical potential. There may be in the form 
      of government regulations, taxes, and subsidies, or through economic incentives 
      in the form of market payments for capturing and holding carbon as suggested 
      in the Kyoto Protocol, depending on its implementation following decisions 
      by CoP.<br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td>GHG mitigation policies can have a large effect on land use, 
      especially through carbon sequestration and biofuel production. In tropical 
      countries, large- scale adoption of mitigation activities could lead to 
      biodiversity conservation, rural employment generation and watershed protection 
      contributing to sustainable development. To achieve this, institutional 
      changes to involve local communities and industry and necessary thereby 
      leading to a reduced role for governments in managing forests.</td>

    <td><u>Agriculture and waste management:</u> Energy inputs are growing by 
      &lt;1% per year globally with the highest increases in non- OECD countries 
      but they have reduced in the EITs. Several options already exist to decrease 
      GHG emissions for investments of -US$ 50 to 150/ tC. These include increasing 
      carbon stock by cropland management (125MtC/ yr by 2010); reducing CH<sub>4</sub> 
      emissions from better livestock management (&gt; 30MtC/ yr) and rice production 
      (7MtC/ yr); soil carbon sequestration (50- 100MtC/ yr) and reducing N<sub>2</sub>O 
      emissions from animal wastes and application of N measures are feasible 
      in most regions given appropriate technology transfer and incentives for 
      farmers to change their traditional methods. Energy cropping to displace 
      fossil fuels has good prospects if the costs can be made more competitive 
      and the crops are produced sustainably. Improved waste management can decrease 
      GHG emissions by 200MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 2010 and 320MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 
      2020 as compared to 240MtC<sub>eq</sub> emissions in 1990.<br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> In agriculture and waste management, these include inadequate 
      R&amp; D funding, lack of intellectual property rights, lack of national 
      human and institutional capacity and information in the developing countries, 
      farm- level adoption constraints, lack of incentives and information for 
      growers in developed countries to adopt new husbandry techniques, (need 
      other benefits, not just greenhouse gas reduction).<br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities:</u> Expansion of credit schemes, shifts in research priorities, 
      development of institutional linkages across countries, trading in soil 
      carbon, and integration of food, fibre, and energy products are ways by 
      which the barriers may be overcome. Measures should be linked with moves 
      towards sustainable production methods.<br>
      <br>
      Energy cropping provides benefits of land use diversification where suitable 
      land is currently under utilized for food and fibre production and water 
      is readily available.<br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td><u>Energy:</u> forest and land management can provide a variety of solid, 
      liquid, or gaseous fuels that are renewable and that can substitute for 
      fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Materials:</u> products from forest and other biological materials are 
      used for construction, packaging, papers, and many other uses and are often 
      less energy- intensive than are alternative materials that provide the same 
      service. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Agriculture/ land use:</u> commitment of large areas to carbon sequestration 
      or carbon management may compliment or conflict with other demands for land, 
      such as agriculture. GHG mitigation will have an impact on agriculture through 
      increased demand for biofuel production in many regions. Increasing competition 
      for arable land may increase prices of food and other agricultural products.

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><u>Waste management:</u> Utilization of methane from landfills and from 
      coal beds. The use of landfill gas for heat and electric power is also growing. 
      In several industrial countries and especially in Europe and Japan, waste- 
      to- energy facilities have become more efficient with lower air pollution 
      emissions, paper and fibre recycling, or by utilizing waste paper as a biofuel 
      in waste to energy facilities.</td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> Little is being done to manage landfill gas or to reduce 
      waste in rapidly growing markets in much of the developing world.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities:</u> countries like the US and Germany have specific policies 
      to either reduce methane producing waste, and/ or requirements to utulize 
      methane from landfills as an energy source. Costs of recovery are negative 
      for half of landfill methane.<br>
      <br>
    </td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><u>Energy sector:</u> In the energy sector, options are available both 
      to increase conversion efficiency and to increase the use of primary energy 
      with less GHGs per unit of energy produced, by sequestering carbon, and 
      reducing GHG leakages. Win-win options such as coal bed methane recovery 
      and improved energy efficiency in coal and gas fired power generation as 
      well as co- production of heat and electricity can help to reduce emissions. 
      With economic development continuing, efficiency increases alone will be 
      insufficient to control GHG emissions from the energy sector. Options to 
      decrease emissions per unit energy produced include new renewable forms 
      of energy, which are showing strong growth but still account for less than 
      1% of energy produced worldwide. Technologies for CO<sub>2</sub> capture 
      and disposal to achieve "clean fossil" energy have been proposed 
      and could contribute significantly at costs competitive with renewable energy 
      although considerable research is still needed on the feasibility and possible 
      environmental impacts of such methods to determine their application and 
      usage. Nuclear power and, in some areas, larger scale hydropower could make 
      a substantially increased contribution but face problems of costs and acceptability. 
      Emerging fuel cells are expected to open opportunities for increasing the 
      average energy conversion efficiency in the decades to come.</td>
    <td><u>Barriers:</u> key barriers are human and institutional capacity, imperfect 
      capital markets that discourage investment in small decentralized systems, 
      more uncertain rates of return on investment, high trade tariffs, lack of 
      information, and lack of intellectual property rights for mitigation technologies. 
      For renewable energy, high first costs, lack of access to capital, and subsidies 
      for fossil fuels and key barriers. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Opportunities</u> for developing countries include promotion of leapfrogs 
      in energy supply and demand technology, facilitating technology transfer 
      through creating an enabling environment, capacity building, and appropriate 
      mechanisms for transfer of clean and efficient energy technologies. Full 
      cost pricing and information systems provide opportunities in developed 
      countries. Ancillary benefits associated with improved technology, and with 
      reduced production and use of fossil fuels, can be substantial.</td>
    <td><u>Coal:</u> Coal production, use, and employment are likely to fall as 
      a result of greenhouse gas mitigation policies, compared with projections 
      of energy supply without additional climate policies. However, the costs 
      of adjustment will be much lower if policies for new coal production also 
      encourage clean coal technology. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Oil:</u> Global mitigation policies are likely to lead to reductions 
      in oil production and trade, with energy exporters likely to face reductions 
      in real incomes as compared to a situation without such policies. The effect 
      on the global oil price of achieving the Kyoto targets, however, may be 
      less severe than many of the models predict, because of the options to include 
      non- CO<sub>2</sub> gases and the flexible mechanisms in achieving the target, which 
      are often not included in the models.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Gas:</u> Over the next 20 years mitigation may influence the use of natural 
      gas may positively or negatively, depending on regional and local conditions. 
      In the Annex I countries any switch that takes place from coal or oil would 
      be towards natural gas and renewable sources for power generation. In the 
      case of the non-Annex 1 countries, the potential for switching to natural 
      gas is much higher, however energy security and the availability of domestic 
      resources are considerations, particularly for countries such as China and 
      India with large coal reserves.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Renewables:</u> Renewable sources are very diverse and the mitigation 
      impact would depend on technological development. It would vary from region 
      to region depending on resource endowment. However, mitigation is very likely 
      to lead to larger markets for the renewables industry. In that situation, 
      R&amp; D for cost reduction and enhanced performance and increased flow 
      of funds to renewables could increase their application leading to cost 
      reduction.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Nuclear:</u> There is substantial technical potential for nuclear power 
      development to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; whether this is realized 
      will depend on relative costs, political factors, and public acceptance.<br>
