          Over the 20th century this increase was 0.6&deg;C with a <em>very likely 
          </em>(see <a href="019.htm#box21">Box 2-1</a>) confidence 
          range of 0.4-0.8&deg;C (see <a href="022.htm">Figure 
          2-3</a>).It is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade, and 
          1998 the warmest year, of the instrumental record. Extending the instrumental 
          record with proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere indicates that over 
          the past 1,000 years the 20th century increase in temperature is likely 
          to have been the largest of any century, and the 1990s was likely the 
          warmest decade (see <a href="022.htm">Figure 2-3</a>). 
          Insufficient data are available in the Southern Hemisphere prior to 
          the year 1860 to compare the recent warming with changes over the last 
          1,000 years. Since the year 1950, the increase in sea surface temperature 
          is about half that of the mean land surface air temperature. During 
          this period the nighttime daily minimum temperatures over land have 
          increased on average by about 0.2&deg;C per decade, about twice the 
          corresponding rate of increase in daytime maximum air temperatures. 
          These climate changes have lengthened the frost-free season in many 
          mid- and high-latitude regions.<br>

      <strong>Figure 2-1: Records of past changes in atmospheric composition over 
      the last millennium demonstrate the rapid rise in greenhouse gases and sulfate 
      aerosols that is attributable primarily to industrial growth since 1750.</strong> 
      The top three panels show increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon 
      dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) 
      over the past 1,000 years. Early sporadic data taken from air trapped in 
      ice (symbols) matches up with continuous atmospheric observations from recent 
      decades (solid lines). These gases are well mixed in the atmosphere, and 
      their concentrations reflect emissions from sources throughout the globe. 
      The estimated positive radiative forcing from these gases is indicated on 
      the righthand scale. The lowest panel shows the concentration of sulfate 
      in ice cores from Greenland (shown by lines for three different cores) from 
      which the episodic effects of volcanic eruptions have been removed. Sulfate 
      aerosols form from sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, deposit readily 
      at the surface, and are not well mixed in the atmosphere. Specifically, 
      the increase in sulfate deposited at Greenland is attributed to SO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions from the U.S. and Europe (shown as symbols), and both show a decline 
      in recent decades. Sulfate aerosols produce negative radiative forcing.<br>

      <strong>Figure 2-2: The influence of external factors on climate can be 
      broadly compared using the concept of radiative forcing.</strong> These 
      radiative forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration 
      of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the output of the sun. 
      Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked to each. 
      The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions of these forcings, 
      some of which yield warming and some cooling. Forcing due to episodic volcanic 
      events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting only for a few years, is 
      not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown is their effect on the 
      size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect effect of aerosols 
      on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which would also lead 
      to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on greenhouse gases 
      are included in the individual bars. The vertical line about the rectangular 
      bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the spread in the published 
      values of the forcings and physical understanding. Some of the forcings 
      possess a much greater degree of certainty than others. A vertical line 
      without a rectangular bar denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can 
      be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall level of scientific understanding 
      for each forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing 
      agents are well mixed over the globe, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby perturbing 
      the global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional 
      signatures because of their spatial distribution, such as aerosols. Radiative 
      forcing continues to be a useful tool to estimate, to a first order, the 
      relative climate impacts such as the relative global mean surface temperature 
      response due to radiatively induced perturbations, but these global mean 
      forcing estimates are not necessarily indicators of the detailed aspects 
      of the potential climate responses (e.g., regional climate change).</td>
