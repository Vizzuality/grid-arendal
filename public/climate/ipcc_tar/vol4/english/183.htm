<h1>6 Policies, Measures, and Instruments</h1>
<h2><a name="61"></a>6.1 Policy Instruments and Possible Criteria for their Assessment</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to examine the major types of policies and measures 
  that can be used to implement options to mitigate net concentrations of GHGs 
  in the atmosphere. In keeping within the defined scope of this Report, policies 
  and measures that can be used to implement or reduce the costs of adaptation 
  to climate change are not examined. Alternative policy instruments are discussed 
  and assessed in terms of specific criteria, all on the basis of the most recent 
  literature. There is naturally some emphasis on the instruments mentioned in 
  the Kyoto Protocol (the Kyoto mechanisms), because they are new and focus on 
  achieving GHG emissions limits, and the extent of their envisaged international 
  application is unprecedented. In addition to economic dimensions, political 
  economy, legal, and institutional elements are discussed insofar as they are 
  relevant to these policies and measures. </p>
<p>Any individual country can choose from a large set of possible policies, measures, 
  and instruments, including (in arbitrary order): emissions, carbon, or energy 
  taxes, tradable permits, subsidies, deposit-refund systems, voluntary agreements, 
  non-tradable permits, technology and performance standards, product bans, and 
  direct government spending, including R&amp;D investment. Likewise, a group 
  of countries that wants to limit its collective GHG emissions could agree to 
  implement one, or a mix, of the following instruments (in arbitrary order): 
  tradable quotas, joint implementation, clean development mechanism, harmonized 
  emissions or carbon or energy taxes, an international emissions, carbon, or 
  energy tax, non-tradable quotas, international technology and product standards, 
  voluntary agreements, and direct international transfers of financial resources 
  and technology.</p>
<p>Possible criteria for the assessment of policy instruments include: environmental 
  effectiveness; cost effectiveness; distributional considerations including competitiveness 
  concerns; administrative and political feasibility; government revenues; wider 
  economic effects including implications for international trade rules; wider 
  environmental effects including carbon leakage; and effects on changes in attitudes, 
  awareness, learning, innovation, technical progress, and dissemination of technology. 
  Each government may apply different weights to various criteria when evaluating 
  GHG mitigation policy options depending on national and sector level circumstances. 
  Moreover, a government may apply different sets of weights to the criteria when 
  evaluating national (domestic) versus international policy instruments. Co-ordinated 
  actions could help address competitiveness concerns, potential conflicts with 
  international trade rules, and carbon leakage.</p>
<p>The economics literature on the choice of policies adopted has emphasized the 
  importance of interest group pressures, focusing on the demand for regulation. 
  But it has tended to neglect the "supply side" of the political equation, 
  emphasized in the political science literature: the legislators and government 
  and party officials who design and implement regulatory policy, and who ultimately 
  decide which instruments or mix of instruments will be used. However, the point 
  of compliance of alternative policy instruments, whether they are applied to 
  fossil fuel users or manufacturers, for example, is likely to be politically 
  crucial to the choice of policy instrument. And a key insight is that some forms 
  of regulation actually can benefit the regulated industry, for example, by limiting 
  entry into the industry or imposing higher costs on new entrants. A policy that 
  imposes costs on industry as a whole might still be supported by firms who would 
  fare better than their competitors. Regulated firms, of course, are not the 
  only group with a stake in regulation: opposing interest groups will fight for 
  their own interests.</p>
