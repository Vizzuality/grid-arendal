<h1>C. The Forcing Agents That Cause Climate Change</h1>
In addition to the past variations and changes in the Earth's climate, observations 
have also documented the changes that have occurred in agents that can cause climate 
change. Most notable among these are increases in the atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases and aerosols (microscopic airborne particles or droplets) 
and variations in solar activity, both of which can alter the Earth's radiation 
budget and hence climate. These observational records of climate-forcing agents 
are part of the input needed to understand the past climate changes noted in the 
preceding Section and, very importantly, to predict what climate changes could 
lie ahead (see <a href="099.htm">Section F</a>).<br>
<p>Like the record of past climate changes, the data sets for forcing agents are 
  of varying length and quality. Direct measurements of solar irradiance exist 
  for only about two decades. The sustained direct monitoring of the atmospheric 
  concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) began about the middle of 
  the 20th century and, in later years, for other long-lived, well-mixed gases 
  such as methane. Palaeo-atmospheric data from ice cores reveal the concentration 
  changes occurring in earlier millennia for some greenhouse gases. In contrast, 
  the time-series measurements for the forcing agents that have relatively short 
  residence times in the atmosphere (e.g., aerosols) are more recent and are far 
  less complete, because they are harder to measure and are spatially heterogeneous. 
  Current data sets show the human influence on atmospheric concentrations of 
  both the long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived forcing agents during the 
  last part of the past millennium. <a href="#figTechSum8">Figure 8</a> illustrates 
  the effects of the large growth over the Industrial Era in the anthropogenic 
  emissions of greenhouse gases and sulphur dioxide, the latter being a precursor 
  of aerosols.</p>
<p>A change in the energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere system due 
  to changes in these forcing agents is termed radiative forcing (Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  of the climate system (see <a href="081.htm#box1">Box 1</a>). Defined in this 
  manner, radiative forcing of climate change constitutes an index of the relative 
  global mean impacts on the surface-troposphere system due to different natural 
  and anthropogenic causes. This Section updates the knowledge of the radiative 
  forcing of climate change that has occurred from pre-industrial times to the 
  present. <a href="#figTechSum9">Figure 9</a> shows the estimated radiative forcings 
  from the beginning of the Industrial Era (1750) to 1999 for the quantifiable 
  natural and anthropogenic forcing agents. Although not included in the figure 
  due to their episodic nature, volcanic eruptions are the source of another important 
  natural forcing. Summaries of the information about each forcing agent follow 
  in the sub-sections below.</p>
<p>The forcing agents included in <a href="#figTechSum9">Figure 
  9</a> vary greatly in their form, magnitude and spatial distribution. Some of 
  the greenhouse gases are emitted directly into the atmosphere; some are chemical 
  products from other emissions. Some greenhouse gases have long atmospheric residence 
  times and, as a result, are well-mixed throughout the atmosphere. Others are 
  short-lived and have heterogeneous regional concentrations. Most of the gases 
  originate from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Lastly, as shown in <a href="#figTechSum9">Figure 
  9</a>, the radiative forcings of individual agents can be positive (i.e., a 
  tendency to warm the Earth's surface) or negative (i.e., a tendency to cool 
  the Earth's surface).</p>

      <p><b>Figure 9: </b>Global, annual-mean radiative forcings (Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
        due to a number of agents for the period from pre-industrial (1750) to 
        present (late 1990s; about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in 
        <a href="../../wg1/251.htm#tab611">Table 
        6.11</a> of <a href="../../wg1/212.htm">Chapter 
        6</a>). For detailed explanations, see <a href="../../wg1/251.htm">Chapter 
        6.13</a>. The height of the rectangular bar denotes a central or best 
        estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. 
        The vertical line about the rectangular bar with "x" delimiters indicates 
        an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the 
        spread in the published values of the forcing. A vertical line without 
        a rectangular bar and with "o" delimiters denotes a forcing for which 
        no central estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The uncertainty 
        range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from 
        the use of the term elsewhere in this document. A "level of scientific 
        understanding" index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low 
        and very low levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement 
        about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such 
        as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge 
        of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties 
        surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see <a href="../../wg1/252.htm#tab612">Table 
        6.12</a>). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a 
        single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO<sub>2</sub>, 
        CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and halocarbons shown (see <a href="../../wg1/221.htm#tab61">Tables 
        6.1</a> and <a href="../../wg1/251.htm#tab611">6.11</a>). 
        Fossil fuel burning is separated into the "black carbon" and "organic 
        carbon" components with its separate best estimate and range. The sign 
        of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect 
        forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood. The same is 
        true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and 
        cirrus clouds. Only the "first" type of indirect effect due to aerosols 
        as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The 
        "second" type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists very 
        little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing 
        associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly 
        variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, 
        see <a href="../../wg1/254.htm#fig68">Figure 
        6.8</a>). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features 
        (<a href="../../wg1/253.htm#fig67">Figure 
        6.7</a>) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do 
        not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only 
        intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a 
        global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain the 
        climate response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As 
        in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean 
        forcings cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in 
        terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on <a href="../../wg1/245.htm#fig66">Figure
