<h1>Annex B. Glossary of Terms</h1>
<p>This Glossary is based on the glossaries published in the IPCC Third Assessment 
  Report (IPCC, 2001a,b,c); however, additional work has been undertaken on consistency 
  and refinement of some of the terms. The terms that are independent entries 
  in this glossary are highlighted in <i>italics</i>. </p>
<p><b>Acclimatization</b><br>
  The physiological adaptation to climatic variations.</p>
<p><b>Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ)</b><br>
  The pilot phase for <i>Joint Implementation</i>, as defined in Article 4.2(a) 
  of the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i>, that allows 
  for project activity among developed countries (and their companies) and between 
  developed and developing countries (and their companies). AIJ is intended to 
  allow Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to 
  gain experience in jointly implemented project activities. There is no crediting 
  for AIJ activity during the pilot phase. A decision remains to be taken on the 
  future of AIJ projects and how they may relate to the <i>Kyoto Mechanisms</i>. 
  As a simple form of tradable permits, AIJ and other market-based schemes represent 
  important potential mechanisms for stimulating additional resource flows for 
  the global environmental good. See also <i>Clean Development Mechanism and emissions 
  trading</i>. </p>
<p><b>Adaptability</b><br>
  See <i>Adaptive capacity</i>.</p>
<p><b>Adaptation</b><br>
  Adjustment in natural or <i>human systems</i> to a new or changing environment. 
  Adaptation to<i> climate change</i> refers to adjustment in natural or human 
  systems in response to actual or expected climatic <i>stimuli</i> or their effects, 
  which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Various types of 
  adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, 
  private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation. </p>
<p><b>Adaptation assessment</b><br>
  The practice of identifying options to adapt to <i>climate change</i> and evaluating 
  them in terms of criteria such as availability, benefits, costs, effectiveness, 
  efficiency, and feasibility.</p>
<p><b>Adaptation benefits</b><br>
  The avoided damage costs or the accrued benefits following the adoption and<i> 
  implementation</i> of <i>adaptation </i>measures.</p>
<p><b>Adaptation costs</b><br>
  Costs of planning, preparing for, facilitating, and implementing <i>adaptation</i> 
  measures, including transition costs.</p>
<p><b>Adaptive capacity</b><br>
  The ability of a system to adjust to <i>climate change</i> (including <i>climate 
  variability</i> and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage 
  of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.</p>
<p><b>Additionality</b><br>
  Reduction in <i>emissions</i> by <i>sources</i> or enhancement of removals by 
  sinks that is additional to any that would occur in the absence of a Joint Implementation 
  or a Clean Development Mechanism project activity as defined in the <i>Kyoto 
  Protocol </i>Articles on <i>Joint Implementation</i> and the <i>Clean Development 
  Mechanism</i>. This definition may be further broadened to include financial, 
  investment, and <i>technology</i> additionality. Under "financial additionality," 
  the project activity funding shall be additional to existing Global Environmental 
  Facility, other financial commitments of Parties included in Annex I, Official 
  Development Assistance, and other systems of cooperation. Under "investment 
  additionality," the value of the <i>Emissions Reduction Unit/Certified Emission 
  Reduction Unit</i> shall significantly improve the financial and/or commercial 
  viability of the project activity. Under "technology additionality," the technology 
  used for the project activity shall be the best available for the circumstances 
  of the host Party.</p>
<p><b>Adjustment time</b><br>
  See <i>Lifetime</i>; see also <i>Response tim</i>e.</p>
<p><b>Aerosols <br>
  </b>A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size 
  between 0.01 and 10 &micro;m that reside in the <i>atmosphere</i> for at least 
  several hours. Aerosols may be of either natural or <i>anthropogenic</i> origin. 
  Aerosols may influence climate in two ways: directly through scattering and 
  absorbing radiation, and indirectly through acting as condensation nuclei for 
  cloud formation or modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. 
  See <i>indirect aerosol effect</i>.</p>
<p><b>Afforestation</b><br>
  Planting of new <i>forests</i> on lands that historically have not contained 
  forests. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as <i>afforestation</i>, 
  <i>reforestation</i>, and <i>deforestation</i>, see the IPCC Special Report 
  on Land Use, Land- Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000b). </p>
<p><b>Aggregate impacts</b><br>
  Total impacts summed up across sectors and/or regions. The aggregation of impacts 
  requires knowledge of (or assumptions about) the relative importance of impacts 
  in different sectors and regions. Measures of aggregate impacts include, for 
  example, the total number of people affected, change in net primary productivity, 
  number of systems undergoing change, or total economic costs.</p>
<p><b>Albedo <br>
  </b>The fraction of <i>solar radiation</i> reflected by a surface or object, 
  often expressed as a percentage. Snow covered surfaces have a high albedo; the 
  albedo of soils ranges from high to low; vegetation covered surfaces and oceans 
  have a low albedo. The Earth's albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, 
  snow, ice, leaf area, and land cover changes. </p>
<p><b>Algal blooms<br>
  </b>A reproductive explosion of algae in a lake, river, or ocean. </p>
<p><b>Alpine</b><br>
  The biogeographic zone made up of slopes above timberline and characterized 
  by the presence of rosette-forming herbaceous plants and low shrubby slow-growing 
  woody plants.</p>
<p><b>Alternative development paths <br>
  </b>Refer to a variety of possible <i>scenarios</i> for societal <i>values</i> 
  and consumption and production patterns in all countries, including, but not 
  limited to, a continuation of today's trends. In this report, these paths do 
  not include additional <i>climate</i> initiatives which means that no scenarios 
  are included that explicitly assume <i>implementation</i> of the <i>United Nations 
  Framework Convention on Climate Change</i> or the emission targets of the <i>Kyoto 
  Protocol</i>, but do include assumptions about other policies that influence 
  <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> indirectly.</p>
<p><b>Alternative energy</b><br>
  Energy derived from non-fossil-fuel sources. </p>
<p><b>Ancillary benefits</b><br>
  The ancillary, or side effects, of policies aimed exclusively at <i>climate 
  change mitigation</i>. Such policies have an impact not only on <i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i>, but also on resource use efficiency, like reduction in emissions 
  of local and regional air pollutants associated with <i>fossil-fuel </i>use, 
  and on issues such as transportation, agriculture, <i>land-use</i> practices, 
  employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these benefits are referred to as "ancillary 
  impacts" to reflect that in some cases the benefits may be negative. From the 
  perspective of policies directed at abating local air pollution, greenhouse 
  gas mitigation may also be considered an ancillary benefit, but these relationships 
  are not considered in this assessment.</p>
<p><b>Annex I countries/Parties <br>
  </b>Group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the <i>United 
  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i>, including all the developed 
  countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and 
  <i>economies in transition</i>. By default, the other countries are referred 
  to as <i>non-Annex I countries</i>. Under Articles 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) of the 
  Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically to the aim of returning 
  individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> 
  by the year 2000. See also <i>Annex II, Annex B</i>, and <i>non-Annex B countries</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>Annex II countries</b><br>
  Group of countries included in Annex II to the <i>United Nations Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change</i>, including all developed countries in the Organisation 
  for Economic Cooperation and Development. Under Article 4.2(g) of the Convention, 
  these countries are expected to provide financial resources to assist developing 
  countries to comply with their obligations, such as preparing national reports. 
  Annex II countries are also expected to promote the transfer of <i>environmentally 
  sound technologies</i> to developing countries. See also <i>Annex I, Annex B, 
  non-Annex I</i>, and <i>non-Annex B countries/Parties</i>. </p>
<p><b>Annex B countries/Parties</b><br>
  Group of countries included in Annex B in the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i> that have 
  agreed to a target for their <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i>, including all 
  the <i>Annex I countries</i> (as amended in 1998) but Turkey and Belarus. See 
  also <i>Annex II, non- Annex I</i>, and <i>non-Annex B countries/Parties</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic</b><br>
  Resulting from or produced by human beings. </p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic emissions</b><br>
  <i> Emissions of greenhouse gases</i>, greenhouse gas <i>precursors</i>, and 
  aerosols associated with human activities. These include burning of <i>fossil 
  fuels</i> for energy, <i>deforestation</i>, and <i>land-use</i> changes that 
  result in net increase in emissions. </p>
<p><b>Aquaculture</b><br>
  Breeding and rearing fish, shellfish, etc., or growing plants for food in special 
  ponds.</p>
<p><b>Aquifer</b><br>
  A stratum of permeable rock that bears water. An unconfined aquifer is recharged 
  directly by local rainfall, rivers, and lakes, and the rate of recharge will 
  be influenced by the permeability of the overlying rocks and soils. A confined 
  aquifer is characterized by an overlying bed that is impermeable and the local 
  rainfall does not influence the aquifer.</p>
<p><b>Arid regions</b><br>
  <i> Ecosystems</i> with less than 250 mm precipitation per year. </p>
<p><b>Assigned amounts (AAs)</b><br>
  Under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>, the total amount of <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> 
  that each <i>Annex B country</i> has agreed that its emissions will not exceed 
  in the first commitment period (2008 to 2012) is the assigned amount. This is 
  calculated by multiplying the country's total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 
  by five (for the 5-year commitment period) and then by the percentage it agreed 
  to as listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., 92% for the European Union, 
  93% for the USA).</p>
<p><b>Assigned amount unit (AAU)</b><br>
  Equal to 1 tonne (metric ton) of <i>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions</i> 
  calculated using the <i>Global Warming Potential</i>. </p>
<p><b>Atmosphere</b><br>
  The gaseous envelop surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost 
  entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% <i>volume 
  mixing ratio</i>), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% 
  volume mixing ratio), helium, and radiatively active <i>greenhouse gases</i> 
  such as <i>carbon dioxide</i> (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and <i>ozone</i>. 
  In addition, the atmosphere contains water vapor, whose amount is highly variable 
  but typically 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and 
  <i>aerosols</i>.</p>
<p><b>Attribution</b><br>
  See <i>detection and attribution</i>.</p>
<p><b>Banking</b><br>
  According to the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i> [Article 3(13)], Parties included in 
  Annex I to the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i> 
  may save excess <i>emissions</i> allowances or credits from the first commitment 
  period for use in subsequent commitment periods (post-2012).</p>
<p><b>Baseline <br>
  </b>The baseline (or reference) is any datum against which change is measured. 
  It might be a "current baseline," in which case it represents observable, present-day 
  conditions. It might also be a "future baseline," which is a projected future 
  set of conditions excluding the driving factor of interest. Alternative interpretations 
  of the reference conditions can give rise to multiple baselines. </p>
<p><b>Basin</b><br>
  The drainage area of a stream, river, or lake.</p>
<p><b>Biodiversity </b><br>
  The numbers and relative abundances of different genes (genetic diversity), 
  species, and <i>ecosystems</i> (communities) in a particular area.</p>
<p><b>Biofuel </b><br>
  A fuel produced from dry organic matter or combustible oils produced by plants. 
  Examples of biofuel include alcohol (from fermented sugar), black liquor from 
  the paper manufacturing process, wood, and soybean oil.</p>
<p><b>Biomass </b><br>
  The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume; recently dead 
  plant material is often included as dead biomass.</p>
<p><b>Biome </b><br>
  A grouping of similar plant and animal communities into broad landscape units 
  that occur under similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p><b>Biosphere (terrestrial and marine) </b><br>
  The part of the Earth system comprising all <i>ecosystems</i> and living organisms 
  in the <i>atmosphere</i>, on land (terrestrial biosphere), or in the oceans 
  (marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter such as litter, soil 
  organic matter, and oceanic detritus.</p>
<p><b>Biota</b><br>
  All living organisms of an area; the flora and fauna considered as a unit.</p>
<p><b>Black carbon </b><br>
  Operationally defined species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical 
  reactivity and/or thermal stability; consists of soot, charcoal, and/or possible 
  light-absorbing refractory organic matter (Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995).</p>
<p><b>Bog </b><br>
  A poorly drained area rich in accumulated plant material, frequently surrounding 
  a body of open water and having a characteristic flora (such as sedges, heaths, 
  and sphagnum).</p>
<p><b>Boreal forest </b><br>
  <i>Forests</i> of pine, spruce, fir, and larch stretching from the east coast 
  of Canada westward to Alaska and continuing from Siberia westward across the 
  entire extent of Russia to the European Plain.</p>
<p><b>Bottom-up models </b><br>
  A modeling approach that includes technological and engineering details in the 
  analysis. See also <i>top-down models</i>.</p>
<p><b>Burden </b><br>
  The total mass of a gaseous substance of concern in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>Capacity building </b><br>
  In the context of <i>climate change</i>, capacity building is a process of developing 
  the technical skills and institutional capability in developing countries and 
  <i>economies in transition</i> to enable them to participate in all aspects 
  of <i>adaptation</i> to, <i>mitigation</i> of, and research on climate change, 
  and the<i> implementation</i> of the <i>Kyoto Mechanisms</i>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Carbonaceous aerosol </b><br>
  Aerosol consisting predominantly of organic substances and various forms of 
  black carbon (Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995).</p>
<p><b>Carbon cycle </b><br>
  The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms such as as carbon 
  dioxide) through the <i>atmosphere</i>, ocean, terrestrial <i>biosphere</i>, 
  and <i>lithosphere</i>.</p>
<p><b>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) </b><br>
  A naturally occurring gas, and also a by-product of burning <i>fossil fuels</i> 
  and <i>biomass</i>, as well as <i>land-use changes</i> and other industrial 
  processes. It is the principal <i>anthropogenic greenhouse</i> gas that affects 
  the Earth's <i>radiative balance</i>. It is the reference gas against which 
  other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a <i>Global Warming Potential</i> 
  of 1.</p>
<p><b>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilization </b><br>
  The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric 
  <i>carbon dioxide</i> concentration. Depending on their mechanism of <i>photosynthesis</i>, 
  certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon 
  dioxide concentration. In particular, plants that produce a three-carbon compound 
  (C<sub>3</sub>) during photosynthesis-including most trees and agricultural 
  crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes, and vegetables-generally show 
  a larger response than plants that produce a four-carbon compound (C<sub>4</sub>) 
  during photosynthesis-mainly of tropical origin, including grasses and the agriculturally 
  important crops maize, sugar cane, millet, and sorghum.</p>
<p><b>Carbon leakage</b><br>
  See<i> leakage</i>.</p>
<p><b>Carbon taxes</b><br>
  See <i>emissions tax</i>.</p>
<p><b>Catchment</b><br>
  An area that collects and drains rainwater.</p>
<p><b>Certified Emission Reduction (CER) Unit</b><br>
  Equal to 1 tonne (metric ton) of <i>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions</i> 
  reduced or sequestered through a <i>Clean Development Mechanism</i> project, 
  calculated using <i>Global Warming Potentials</i>. See also <i>Emissions Reduction 
  Unit</i>.</p>
<p><b>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) </b><br>
  <i>Greenhouse gases</i> covered under the 1987<i> Montreal Protocol</i> and 
  used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or 
  aerosol propellants. Since they are not destroyed in the lower <i>atmosphere</i>, 
  CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they 
  break down <i>ozone</i>. These gases are being replaced by other compounds, 
  including hydrochlorofluorocarbons and <i>hydrofluorocarbons</i>, which are 
  greenhouse gases covered under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>.</p>
<p><b>Cholera </b><br>
  An intestinal infection that results in frequent watery stools, cramping abdominal 
  pain, and eventual collapse from dehydration.</p>
<p><b>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) </b><br>
  Defined in Article 12 of the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>, the Clean Development Mechanism 
  is intended to meet two objectives: (1) to assist Parties not included in <i>Annex 
  I </i>in achieving <i>sustainable development</i> and in contributing to the 
  ultimate objective of the <i>convention</i>; and (2) to assist Parties included 
  in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation 
  and reduction commitments. <i>Certified Emission Reduction</i> <i>Units</i> 
  from Clean Development Mechanism projects undertaken in <i>non-Annex I</i> <i>countries</i> 
  that limit or reduce <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i>, when certified by operational 
  entities designated by <i>Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties</i>, 
  can be accrued to the investor (government or industry) from Parties in <i>Annex 
  B</i>. A share of the proceeds from the certified project activities is used 
  to cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing country Parties 
  that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of <i>climate change</i> 
  to meet the costs of <i>adaptation</i>.</p>
<p> <b>Climate </b><br>
  Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather" or more 
  rigorously as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability 
  of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands 
  or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World 
  Meteorological Organization (WMO). These relevant quantities are most often 
  surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a 
  wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the <i>climate 
  system</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate change </b><br>
  Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the 
  mean state of the <i>climate</i> or in its variability, persisting for an extended 
  period (typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal 
  processes or <i>external forcings</i>, or to persistent <i>anthropogenic</i> 
  changes in the composition of the <i>atmosphere</i> or in <i>land use</i>. Note 
  that the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i> (UNFCCC), 
  in its Article 1, defines "climate change" as: "a change of climate which is 
  attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition 
  of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability 
  observed over comparable time periods." The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction 
  between "climate change" attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric 
  composition, and "climate variability" attributable to natural causes. See also 
  <i>climate variability</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate feedback </b><br>
  An interaction mechanism between processes in the <i>climate system</i> is called 
  a climate feedback, when the result of an initial process triggers changes in 
  a second process that in turn influences the initial one. A positive feedback 
  intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it.</p>
<p><b>Climate model (hierarchy) </b><br>
  A numerical representation of the <i>climate system</i> based on the physical, 
  chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions and 
  <i>feedback </i>processes, and accounting for all or some of its known properties. 
  The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity-that is, 
  for any one component or combination of components a "hierarchy" of models can 
  be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, 
  the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly 
  represented, or the level at which empirical <i>parametrizations</i> are involved. 
  Coupled atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice <i>general circulation models</i> (AOGCMs) 
  provide a comprehensive representation of the climate system. There is an evolution 
  towards more complex models with active chemistry and biology. Climate models 
  are applied, as a research tool, to study and simulate the climate, but also 
  for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal, and interannual <i>climate 
  predictions</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate prediction </b><br>
  A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce 
  a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of the<i> climate</i> 
  in the future (e.g., at seasonal, interannual, or long-term <i>time-scales</i>). 
  See also <i>climate projection</i> and <i>climate (change) scenario</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate projection </b><br>
  A <i>projection</i> of the response of the <i>climate system</i> to <i>emission</i> 
  or concentration <i>scenarios</i> of <i>greenhouse gases</i> and <i>aerosols</i>, 
  or <i>radiative forcing scenarios</i>, often based upon simulations by <i>climate 
  models</i>. Climate projections are distinguished from <i>climate predictions</i> 
  in order to emphasize that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative 
  forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions, concerning, for example, 
  future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be 
  realized, and are therefore subject to substantial <i>uncertainty</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate scenario </b><br>
  A plausible and often simplified representation of the future <i>climate</i>, 
  based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships, that 
  has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences 
  of <i>anthropogenic climate change</i>, often serving as input to impact models. 
  <i>Climate projections</i> often serve as the raw material for constructing 
  climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually require additional information 
  such as about the observed current climate. A "climate change scenario" is the 
  difference between a climate scenario and the current climate.</p>
<p><b>Climate sensitivity </b><br>
  In IPCC assessments, "equilibrium climate sensitivity" refers to the equilibrium 
  change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric 
  (<i>equivalent</i>) CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. More generally, equilibrium 
  climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in surface air temperature 
  following a unit change in <i>radiative forcing </i>(°C/Wm<sup>-2</sup>). In 
  practice, the evaluation of the equilibrium climate sensitivity requires very 
  long simulations with coupled <i>general circulation models</i>. The "effective 
  climate sensitivity" is a related measure that circumvents this requirement. 
  It is evaluated from model output for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It 
  is a measure of the strengths of the<i> feedbacks</i> at a particular time and 
  may vary with forcing history and climate state. See <i>climate model</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate system </b><br>
  The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: 
  the <i>atmosphere</i>, the <i>hydrosphere</i>, the <i>cryosphere</i>, the land 
  surface and the <i>biosphere</i>, and the interactions between them. The climate 
  system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and 
  because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and 
  human-induced forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and 
  <i>land-use change</i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate variability </b><br>
  Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics 
  (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the <i>climate</i> 
  on all <i>temporal and spatial scales</i> beyond that of individual weather 
  events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the <i>climate 
  system</i> (internal variability), or to variations in natural or <i>anthropogenic 
  external forcing</i> (external variability). See also<i> climate change</i>.</p>
<p><b>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent</b><br>
  See <i>equivalent CO<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>
<p><b>CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization </b><br>
  See <i>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilization</i>.</p>
<p><b>Co-benefits </b><br>
  The benefits of policies that are implemented for various reasons at the same 
  time-including <i>climate change mitigation</i>-acknowledging that most policies 
  designed to address <i>greenhouse gas mitigation</i> also have other, often 
  at least equally important, rationales (e.g., related to objectives of development, 
  sustainability, and equity). The term co-impact is also used in a more generic 
  sense to cover both the positive and negative sides of the benefits. See also 
  <i>ancillary benefits</i>.</p>
<p><b>Co-generation </b><br>
  The use of waste heat from electric generation, such as exhaust from gas turbines, 
  for either industrial purposes or district heating.</p>
<p><b>Compliance</b><br>
  See <i>implementation</i>.</p>
<p><b>Conference of the Parties (COP) </b><br>
  The supreme body of the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i> 
  (UNFCCC), comprising countries that have ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC. 
  The first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-1) was held in Berlin 
  in 1995, followed by COP-2 in Geneva 1996, COP-3 in Kyoto 1997, COP-4 in Buenos

  The variation in climatic <i>stimuli</i> that a system can absorb without producing 
  significant impacts.</p>
<p><b>Coral bleaching </b><br>
  The paling in color of corals resulting from a loss of symbiotic algae. Bleaching

  for the achievement of a given target.</p>
<p><b>Cryosphere </b><br>
  The component of the <i>climate system</i> consisting of all snow, ice, and 
  <i>permafrost</i> on and beneath the surface of the earth and ocean. See also 
  <i>glacier</i> and <i>ice sheet</i>.</p>
<p><b>Deepwater formation </b><br>
  Occurs when seawater freezes to form sea ice. The local release of salt and 
  consequent increase in water density leads to the formation of saline coldwater 
  that sinks to the ocean floor.</p>
<p><b>Deforestation </b><br>
  Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term forest and 
  related terms such as <i>afforestation</i>, <i>reforestation</i>, and <i>deforestation</i>, 
  see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 
  2000b).</p>
<p><b>Demand-side management </b><br>
  Policies and programs designed for a specific purpose to influence consumer 
  demand for goods and/or services. In the energy sector, for instance, it refers 
  to policies and programs designed to reduce consumer demand for electricity 
  and other energy sources. It helps to reduce <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i>.</p>
<p><b>Dengue Fever </b><br>
  An infectious viral disease spread by mosquitoes often called breakbone fever 
  because it is characterized by severe pain in joints and back. Subsequent infections 
  of the virus may lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome 
  (DSS), which may be fatal.</p>
<p><b>Deposit-refund system </b><br>
  Combines a deposit or fee (tax) on a commodity with a refund or rebate (<i>subsidy</i>)

  An <i>ecosystem</i> with less than 100 mm precipitation per year.</p>
<p><b>Desertification </b><br>
  Land degradation in arid, <i>semi-arid</i>, and dry sub-humid areas resulting 
  from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. Further, 
  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification defines land degradation 
  as a reduction or loss in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas of the biological 
  or economic productivity and complexity of rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, 
  or range, pasture, <i>forest</i>, and woodlands resulting from <i>land uses</i> 
  or from a process or combination of processes, including processes arising from 
  human activities and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil <i>erosion</i> caused 
  by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical, and biological 
  or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation. 
</p>
<p><b>Detection and attribution </b><br>
  <i>Climate</i> varies continually on all <i>time scales</i>. Detection of <i>climate 
  change </i>is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some 
  defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. Attribution 
  of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes 
  for the detected change with some defined level of confidence. </p>
<p><b>Disturbance regime</b><br>
  Frequency, intensity, and types of disturbances, such as fires, inspect or pest 
  outbreaks, floods, and <i>droughts</i>.</p>
<p><b>Diurnal temperature range</b><br>
  The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature during a day.</p>
<p><b>Double dividend </b><br>
  The effect that revenue-generating instruments, such as <i>carbon taxes</i> 
  or auctioned (tradable) carbon emission permits, can (i) limit or reduce <i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i> and (ii) offset at least part of the potential welfare losses 
  of climate policies through recycling the revenue in the economy to reduce other 
  taxes likely to be distortionary. In a world with involuntary unemployment, 
  the <i>climate change</i> policy adopted may have an effect (a positive or negative 
  "third dividend") on employment. Weak double dividend occurs as long as there 
  is a <i>revenue recycling</i> effect-that is, as long as revenues are recycled 
  through reductions in the marginal rates of distortionary taxes. Strong double 
  dividend requires that the (beneficial) revenue recycling effect more than offset 
  the combination of the primary cost and, in this case, the net cost of abatement 
  is negative.</p>
<p><b>Drought </b><br>
  The phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal 
  recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect 
  land resource production systems.</p>
<p><b>Economic potential </b><br>
  Economic potential is the portion of <i>technological potential</i> for <i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i> reductions or <i>energy efficiency </i>improvements that could 
  be achieved <i>cost-effectively</i> through the creation of markets, reduction 
  of market failures, or increased financial and technological transfers. The 
  achievement of economic potential requires additional <i>policies</i> <i>and 
  measures</i> to break down <i>market barriers</i>. See also <i>market potential, 
  socio-economic potential,</i> and <i>technological potential</i>.</p>
<p><b>Economies in transition (EITs) </b><br>
  Countries with national economies in the process of changing from a planned 
  economic system to a market economy.</p>
<p><b>Ecosystem </b><br>
  A system of interacting living organisms together with their physical environment. 
  The boundaries of what could be called an ecosystem are somewhat arbitrary, 
  depending on the focus of interest or study. Thus, the extent of an ecosystem 
  may range from very small <i>spatial scales</i> to, ultimately, the entire Earth.</p>
<p><b>Ecosystem services </b><br>
  Ecological processes or functions that have <i>value</i> to individuals or society.</p>
<p><b>El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) </b><br>
  El Niño, in its original sense, is a warmwater current that periodically flows 
  along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. This oceanic 
  event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface pressure 
  pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, called the Southern 
  Oscillation. This coupled atmosphereocean phenomenon is collectively known as 
  El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. During an El Niño event, the prevailing 
  trade winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm 
  surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie the cold waters 
  of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature, 
  and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects 
  throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world. The opposite 
  of an El Niño event is called<i> La Niña</i>.</p>
<p><b>Emissions </b><br>
  In the <i>climate change</i> context, emissions refer to the release of <i>greenhouse 
  gases</i> and/or their <i>precursors</i> and <i>aerosols</i> into the <i>atmosphere</i> 
  over a specified area and period of time.</p>
<p><b>Emissions permit </b><br>
  An emissions permit is the non-transferable or tradable allocation of entitlements 
  by an administrative authority (intergovernmental organization, central or local 
  government agency) to a regional (country, sub-national) or a sectoral (an individual 
  firm) entity to emit a specified amount of a substance.</p>
<p><b>Emissions quota </b><br>
  The portion or share of total allowable <i>emissions</i> assigned to a country 
  or group of countries within a framework of maximum total emissions and mandatory 
  allocations of resources.</p>
<p><b>Emissions Reduction Unit (ERU) </b><br>
  Equal to 1 tonne (metric ton) of <i>carbon dioxide emissions</i> reduced or 
  sequestered arising from a <i>Joint Implementation</i> (defined in Article 6 
  of the Kyoto Protocol) project calculated using <i>Global Warming Potential</i>. 
  See also <i>Certified Emission Reduction Unit</i> and <i>emissions trading</i>.</p>
<p><b>Emissions tax </b><br>
  Levy imposed by a government on each unit of <i>CO<sub>2</sub></i>-<i>equivalent 
  emissions</i> by a <i>source </i>subject to the tax. Since virtually all of 
  the carbon in fossil <i>fuels</i> is ultimately emitted as <i>carbon dioxide</i>, 
  a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels-a <i>carbon tax</i>-is equivalent 
  to an emissions tax for emissions caused by fossil-fuel combustion. An <i>energy 
  tax</i>-a levy on the energy content of fuels-reduces demand for energy and 
  so reduces carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel use. An ecotax is designated 
  for the purpose of influencing human behavior (specifically economic behavior) 
  to follow an ecologically benign path. International emissions/carbon/energy 
  tax is a tax imposed on specified sources in participating countries by an international 
  agency. The revenue is distributed or used as specified by participating countries 
  or the international agency.</p>
<p><b>Emissions trading </b><br>
  A market-based approach to achieving environmental objectives that allows, those 
  reducing <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> below what is required, to use or trade 
  the excess reductions to offset emissions at another source inside or outside 
  the country. In general, trading can occur at the intracompany, domestic, and 
  international levels. The IPCC Second Assessment Report adopted the convention 
  of using "permits" for domestic trading systems and "quotas" for international 
  trading systems. Emissions trading under Article 17 of the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i> 
  is a tradable quota system based on the <i>assigned amounts</i> calculated from 
  the emission reduction and limitation commitments listed in <i>Annex B</i> of 
  the Protocol. See also <i>Certified Emission Reduction Unit</i> and <i>Clean 
  Development Mechanism</i>.</p>
<p><b>Emissions scenario </b><br>
  A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances 
  that are potentially radiatively active (e.g., <i>greenhouse gases, aerosols</i>), 
  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving 
  forces (such as demographic and socio-economic development, technological change) 
  and their key relationships. Concentration scenarios, derived from emissions 
  scenarios, are used as input into a <i>climate model</i> to compute <i>climate 
  projections</i>. In IPCC (1992), a set of emissions scenarios were used as a 
  basis for the climate projections in IPCC (1996). These emissions scenarios 
  are referred to as the IS92 scenarios. In the IPCC Special Report on Emissions 
  Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000), new emissions scenarios-the so-called 
  <i>SRES scenarios</i>-were published. For the meaning of some terms related 
  to these scenarios, see <i>SRES scenarios</i>.</p>
<p><b>Endemic </b><br>
  Restricted or peculiar to a locality or region. With regard to human health, 
  endemic can refer to a disease or agent present or usually prevalent in a population 
  or geographical area at all times.</p>
<p><b>Energy balance </b><br>
  Averaged over the globe and over longer time periods, the energy budget of the 
  <i>climate system</i> must be in balance. Because the climate system derives 
  all its energy from the Sun, this balance implies that, globally, the amount 
  of incoming <i>solar radiation</i> must on average be equal to the sum of the 
  outgoing reflected solar radiation and the outgoing <i>infrared radiation</i> 
  emitted by the climate system. A perturbation of this global radiation balance, 
  be it human-induced or natural, is called <i>radiative forcing</i>.</p>
<p><b>Energy conversion</b><br>
  See<i> energy transformation</i>.</p>
<p><b>Energy efficiency</b><br>
  Ratio of energy output of a conversion process or of a system to its energy 
  input.</p>
<p><b>Energy intensity </b><br>
  Energy intensity is the ratio of energy consumption to economic or physical 
  output. At the national level, energy intensity is the ratio of total domestic 
  <i>primary energy</i> consumption or <i>final energy</i> consumption to <i>Gross 
  Domestic Product</i> or physical output.</p>
<p><b>Energy service</b><br>
  The application of useful energy to tasks desired by the consumer such as transportation, 
  a warm room, or light.</p>
<p><b>Energy tax</b><br>
  See <i>emissions tax</i>.</p>
<p><b>Energy transformation</b><br>
  The change from one form of energy, such as the energy embodied in<i> fossil 
  fuels</i>, to another, such as electricity.</p>
<p><b>Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) </b><br>
  Technologies that protect the environment, are less polluting, use all resources 
  in a more sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, and 
  handle residual wastes in a more acceptable manner than the technologies for 
  which they were substitutes and are compatible with nationally determined socio-economic, 
  cultural, and environmental priorities. ESTs in this report imply mitigation 
  and adaptation technologies, hard and soft technologies.</p>
<p><b>Epidemic </b><br>
  Occurring suddenly in numbers clearly in excess of normal expectancy, said especially 
  of <i>infectious diseases</i> but applied also to any disease, injury, or other 
  health-related event occurring in such outbreaks.</p>
<p><b>Equilibrium and transient climate experiment </b><br>
  An "equilibrium climate experiment" is an experiment in which a <i>climate model</i> 
  is allowed to fully adjust to a change in <i>radiative forcing</i>. Such experiments 
  provide information on the difference between the initial and final states of 
  the model, but not on the time-dependent response. If the forcing is allowed 
  to evolve gradually according to a prescribed <i>emission scenario</i>, the 
  time-dependent response of a climate model may be analyzed. Such an experiment 
  is called a "transient climate experiment." See also<i> climate projection</i>.</p>
<p><b>Equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) </b><br>
  The concentration of <i>carbon dioxide</i> that would cause the same amount 
  of <i>radiative forcing</i> as a given mixture of carbon dioxide and other <i>greenhouse 
  gases</i>.</p>
<p><b>Erosion </b><br>
  The process of removal and transport of soil and rock by weathering, mass wasting, 
  and the action of streams, <i>glaciers</i>, waves, winds, and underground water.</p>
<p><b>Eustatic sea-level change </b><br>
  A change in global average sea level brought about by an alteration to the volume 
  of the world ocean. This may be caused by changes in water density or in the 
  total mass of water. In discussions of changes on geological time scales, this 
  term sometimes also includes changes in global average sea level caused by an 
  alteration to the shape of the ocean basins. In this report, the term is not 
  used in that sense.</p>
<p><b>Eutrophication </b><br>
  The process by which a body of water (often shallow) becomes (either naturally 
  or by pollution) rich in dissolved nutrients with a seasonal deficiency in dissolved 
  oxygen.</p>
<p> <b>Evaporation </b><br>
  The process by which a liquid becomes a gas.</p>
<p><b>Evapotranspiration</b><br>
  The combined process of <i>evaporation</i> from the Earth's surface and 
  <i>transpiration</i> from vegetation.</p>
<p><b>Exotic species</b><br>
  See <i>introduced species</i>.</p>
<p><b>Exposure</b><br>
  The nature and degree to which a system is exposed to significant climatic variations.</p>
<p><b>Externality</b><br>
  See <i>external cost</i>.</p>
<p><b>External cost </b><br>
  Used to define the costs arising from any human activity, when the agent responsible 
  for the activity does not take full account of the impacts on others of his 
  or her actions. Equally, when the impacts are positive and not accounted for 
  in the actions of the agent responsible they are referred to as external benefits. 
  <i>Emissions</i> of particulate pollution from a power station affect the health 
  of people in the vicinity, but this is not often considered, or is given inadequate 
  weight, in private decision making and there is no market for such impacts. 
  Such a phenomenon is referred to as an "externality," and the costs it imposes 
  are referred to as the external costs.</p>
<p><b>External forcing</b><br>
  See <i>climate system</i>.</p>
<p><b>Extinction</b><br>
  The complete disappearance of an entire species.</p>
<p><b>Extirpation</b><br>
  The disappearance of a species from part of its range; local extinction.</p>
<p><b>Extreme weather event </b><br>
  An extreme weather event is an event that is rare within its statistical reference 
  distribution at a particular place. Definitions of "rare" vary, but an extreme 
  weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile. 
  By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary 
  from place to place. An extreme <i>climate</i> event is an average of a number 
  of weather events over a certain period of time, an average which is itself 
  extreme (e.g., rainfall over a season).</p>
<p><b>Feedback </b><br>
  See <i>climate feedback</i>.</p>
<p><b>Fiber </b><br>
  Wood, fuelwood (either woody or non-woody).</p>
<p><b>Final energy </b><br>
  Energy supplied that is available to the consumer to be converted into usable 
  energy (e.g., electricity at the wall outlet).</p>
<p><b>Flexibility mechanisms </b><br>
  See <i>Kyoto Mechanisms</i>.</p>
<p><b>Flux adjustment </b><br>
  To avoid the problem of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models 
  drifting into some unrealistic climate state, adjustment terms can be applied 
  to the atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat and moisture (and sometimes the surface 
  stresses resulting from the effect of the wind on the ocean surface) before 
  these fluxes are imposed on the model ocean and atmosphere. Because these adjustments 
  are pre-computed and therefore independent of the coupled model integration, 
  they are uncorrelated to the anomalies that develop during the integration.</p>
<p><b>Food insecurity </b><br>
  A situation that exists when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts 
  of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active 
  and healthy life. It may be caused by the unavailability of food, insufficient 
  purchasing power, inappropriate distribution, or inadequate use of food at the 
  household level. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal, or transitory.</p>
<p><b>Forest </b><br>
  A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions of the term forest are 
  in use throughout the world, reflecting wide differences in bio-geophysical 
  conditions, social structure, and economics. For a discussion of the term forest 
  and related terms such as<i> afforestation</i>, <i>reforestation</i>, and <i>deforestation</i>: 
  see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 
  2000b).</p>

  See <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i>.</p>
<p><b>General circulation </b><br>
  The large scale motions of the <i>atmosphere</i> and the ocean as a consequence 
  of differential heating on a rotating Earth, aiming to restore the <i>energy 
  balance</i> of the system through transport of heat and momentum.</p>

  Model (GCM) See <i>climate model</i>.</p>
<p><b>Geo-engineering </b><br>
  Efforts to stabilize the climate system by directly managing the energy balance 
  of the Earth, thereby overcoming the enhanced <i>greenhouse effect</i>.</p>
<p><b>Glacier </b><br>
  A mass of land ice flowing downhill (by internal deformation and sliding at 
  the base) and constrained by the surrounding topography (e.g., the sides of 
  a valley or surrounding peaks); the bedrock topography is the major influence 
  on the dynamics and surface slope of a glacier. A glacier is maintained by accumulation 
  of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at low altitudes or discharge 
  into the sea.</p>
<p><b>Global surface temperature </b><br>
  The global surface temperature is the area-weighted global average of (i) the 
  sea surface temperature over the oceans (i.e., the sub-surface bulk temperature 
  in the first few meters of the ocean), and (ii) the surface air temperature 
  over land at 1.5 m above the ground.</p>
<p><b>Global Warming Potential (GWP) </b><br>
  An index, describing the radiative characteristics of well-mixed <i>greenhouse 
  gases</i>, that represents the combined effect of the differing times these 
  gases remain in the <i>atmosphere</i> and their relative effectiveness in absorbing 
  outgoing <i>infrared radiation</i>. This index approximates the time-integrated 
  warming effect of a unit mass of a given greenhouse gas in today's atmosphere, 
  relative to that of <i>carbon dioxide</i>.</p>
<p>Gr<b>eenhouse effect </b><br>
  <i> Greenhouse gases</i> effectively absorb <i>infrared radiation</i>, emitted 
  by the Earth's surface, by the <i>atmosphere </i>itself due to the same gases, 
  and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward 
  to the Earth's surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere 
  system. This is called the "natural greenhouse effect." Atmospheric radiation 
  is strongly coupled to the temperature of the level at which it is emitted. 
  In the <i>troposphere</i>, the temperature generally decreases with height. 
  Effectively, infrared radiation emitted to space originates from an altitude 
  with a temperature of, on average, -19°C, in balance with the net incoming <i>solar 
  radiation</i>, whereas the Earth's surface is kept at a much higher temperature 
  of, on average, +14°C. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases 
  leads to an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere, and therefore to an 
  effective radiation into space from a higher altitude at a lower temperature. 
  This causes a <i>radiative forcing</i>, an imbalance that can only be compensated 
  for by an increase of the temperature of the surface-troposphere system. This 
  is the "enhanced greenhouse effect."</p>
<p><b>Greenhouse gas </b><br>
  Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the <i>atmosphere</i>, both 
  natural and <i>anthropogenic</i>, that absorb and emit radiation at specific 
  wavelengths within the spectrum of <i>infrared radiation</i> emitted by the 
  Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and clouds. This property causes the <i>greenhouse 
  effect</i>. Water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous 
  oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) 
  are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover there are 
  a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as 
  the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt 
  with under the Montreal Protocol. Besides CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulfur hexafluoride 
  (SF<sub>6</sub>), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).</p>
<p><b>Groin </b><br>
  A low, narrow jetty, usually extending roughly perpendicular to the shoreline,

<p><b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) </b><br>
  The sum of gross <i>value added</i>, at purchasers' prices, by all resident 
  and non-resident producers in the economy, plus any taxes and minus any subsidies 
  not included in the value of the products in a country or a geographic region 
  for a given period of time, normally 1 year. It is calculated without deducting 
  for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural 
  <i>resources</i>. GDP is an often used but incomplete measure of welfare.</p>

  The amount of carbon fixed from the <i>atmosphere</i> through <i>photosynthesis</i>.</p>
<p><b>Groundwater recharge </b><br>
  The process by which external water is added to the zone of saturation of an 
  <i>aquifer</i>, either directly into a formation or indirectly by way of another 
  formation.</p>
<p><b>Habitat </b><br>
  The particular environment or place where an organism or species tend to live; 
  a more locally circumscribed portion of the total environment.</p>
<p><b>Halocarbons </b><br>
  Compounds containing carbon and either chlorine, bromine, or fluorine. Such 
  compounds can act as powerful <i>greenhouse gases</i> in the <i>atmosphere</i>. 
  The chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons are also involved in the depletion 
  of the <i>ozone layer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Harmonized emissions/carbon/energy tax </b><br>
  Commits participating countries to impose a tax at a common rate on the same 
  <i>sources</i>. Each country can retain the tax revenue it collects. A harmonized 
  tax would not necessarily require countries to impose a tax at the same rate, 
  but imposing different rates across countries would not be <i>cost-effective</i>. 
  See also <i>emissions tax</i>.</p>
<p><b>Heat island </b><br>
  An area within an urban area characterized by ambient temperatures higher than 
  those of the surrounding area because of the absorption of solar energy by materials

  temperature of 16°C counts as 2 heating degree days). See also <i>cooling degree 
  days</i>.</p>
<p><b>Hedging </b><br>
  In the context of climate change mitigation, hedging is defined as balancing 
  the risks of acting too slowly against acting too quickly, and it depends on 
  society's attitude towards risks.</p>

  system, political system, technological system, economic system).</p>
<p><b>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) </b><br>
  Among the six <i>greenhouse gases</i> to be curbed under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>. 
  They are produced commercially as a substitute for <i>chlorofluorocarbons</i>.

  water, such as oceans, seas, rivers, freshwater lakes, underground water, etc.</p>
<p><b>Ice cap </b><br>
  A dome shaped ice mass covering a highland area that is considerably smaller 
  in extent than an <i>ice sheet</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ice sheet </b><br>
  A mass of land ice that is sufficiently deep to cover most of the underlying 
  bedrock topography, so that its shape is mainly determined by its internal dynamics 
  (the flow of the ice as it deforms internally and slides at its base). An ice 
  sheet flows outward from a high central plateau with a small average surface 
  slope. The margins slope steeply, and the ice is discharged through fast-flowing 
  ice streams or outlet <i>glaciers</i>, in some cases into the sea or into<i> 
  ice shelves</i> floating on the sea. There are only two large ice sheets in 
  the modern world, on Greenland and Antarctica, the Antarctic ice sheet being 
  divided into East and West by the Transantarctic Mountains; during glacial periods 
  there were others.</p>
<p><b>Ice shelf </b><br>
  A floating <i>ice sheet</i> of considerable thickness attached to a coast (usually 
  of great horizontal extent with a level or gently undulating surface); often

  impacts</i>.</p>
<p><b>Implementation </b><br>
  Implementation refers to the actions (legislation or regulations, judicial decrees, 
  or other actions) that governments take to translate international accords into 
  domestic law and policy. It includes those events and activities that occur 
  after the issuing of authoritative public policy directives, which include the 
  effort to administer and the substantive impacts on people and events. It is 
  important to distinguish between the legal implementation of international commitments 
  (in national law) and the effective implementation (measures that induce changes 
  in the behavior of target groups). Compliance is a matter of whether and to 
  what extent countries do adhere to the provisions of the accord. Compliance 
  focuses on not only whether implementing measures are in effect, but also on 
  whether there is compliance with the implementing actions. Compliance measures 
  the degree to which the actors whose behavior is targeted by the agreement, 
  whether they are local government units, corporations, organizations, or individuals, 
  conform to the implementing measures and obligations.</p>
<p><b>Implementation costs </b><br>
  Costs involved in the <i>implementation</i> of <i>mitigation</i> options. These 
  costs are associated with the necessary institutional changes, information requirements, 
  market size, <i>opportunities</i> for <i>technology</i> gain and learning, and 
  economic incentives needed (grants, subsidies, and taxes).</p>
<p><b>Indigenous peoples </b><br>
  People whose ancestors inhabited a place or a country when persons from another 
  culture or ethnic background arrived on the scene and dominated them through 
  conquest, settlement, or other means and who today live more in conformity with 
  their own social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than those of 
  the country of which they now form a part (also referred to as "native," "aboriginal," 
  or "tribal" peoples).</p>
<p><b>Indirect aerosol effect </b><br>
  <i>Aerosols </i>may lead to an indirect<i> radiative forcing</i> of the <i>climate 
  system</i> through acting as condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties 
  and lifetime of clouds. Two indirect effects are distinguished:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First indirect effect: A radiative forcing induced by an increase in <i>anthropogenic</i> 
    aerosols which cause an initial increase in droplet concentration and a decrease 
    in droplet size for fixed liquid water content, leading to an increase of 
    cloud albedo. This effect is also known as the "Twomey effect." This is sometimes 
    referred to as the cloud albedo effect. However this is highly misleading 
    since the second indirect effect also alters cloud <i>albedo</i>.</li>
  <li>Second indirect effect: A radiative forcing induced by an increase in anthropogenic 
    aerosols which cause a decrease in droplet size, reducing the precipitation 
    efficiency, thereby modifying the liquid water content, cloud thickness, and 
    cloud lifetime. This effect is also known as the "cloud lifetime effect" or 
    "Albrecht effect."</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Industrial Revolution </b><br>
  A period of rapid industrial growth with far-reaching social and economic consequences, 
  beginning in England during the second half of the 18th century and spreading 
  to Europe and later to other countries including the United States. The invention 
  of the steam engine was an important trigger of this development. The Industrial 
  Revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase in the use of <i>fossil 
  fuels</i> and emission of, in particular, fossil <i>carbon dioxide</i>. In this 
  report, the terms "pre-industrial" and "industrial" refer, somewhat arbitrarily, 
  to the periods before and after the year 1750, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Inertia </b><br>
  Delay, slowness, or resistance in the response of the <i>climate</i>, biological, 
  or <i>human systems</i> to factors that alter their rate of change, including 
  continuation of change in the system after the cause of that change has been 
  removed.</p>
<p><b>Infectious diseases </b><br>
  Any disease that can be transmitted from one person to another. This may occur 
  by direct physical contact, by common handling of an object that has picked 
  up infective organisms, through a disease carrier, or by spread of infected 
  droplets coughed or exhaled into the air.</p>
<p><b>Infrared radiation </b><br>
  Radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the <i>atmosphere,</i> and clouds. 
  It is also known as terrestrial or long-wave radiation. Infrared radiation has 
  a distinctive range of wavelengths ("spectrum") longer than the wavelength of 
  the red color in the visible part of the spectrum. The spectrum of infrared 
  radiation is practically distinct from that of solar or short-wave radiation 
  because of the difference in temperature between the Sun and the Earth-atmosphere 
  system.</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure </b><br>
  The basic equipment, utilities, productive enterprises, installations, institutions, 
  and services essential for the development, operation, and growth of an organization, 
  city, or nation. For example, roads; schools; electric, gas, and water utilities; 
  transportation; communication; and legal systems would be all considered as 
  infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>Integrated assessment</b> <br>
  A method of analysis that combines results and models from the physical, biological, 
  economic, and social sciences, and the interactions between these components, 
  in a consistent framework, to evaluate the status and the consequences of environmental 
  change and the policy responses to it.</p>
<p><b>Interaction effect </b><br>
  The result or consequence of the interaction of <i>climate change</i> policy 
  instruments with existing domestic tax systems, including both cost-increasing 
  tax interaction and cost-reducing revenue-recycling effect. The former reflects 
  the impact that <i>greenhouse gas</i> policies can have on the functioning of 
  labor and capital markets through their effects on real wages and the real return 
  to capital. By restricting the allowable greenhouse gas<i> emissions</i>, permits, 
  regulations, or a <i>carbon tax </i>raise the costs of production and the prices 
  of output, thus reducing the real return to labor and capital. For policies 
  that raise revenue for the government-carbon taxes and auctioned permits-the 
  revenues can be recycled to reduce existing distortionary taxes. See also <i>double 
  dividend</i>.</p>

<p><b>International Energy Agency (IEA) </b><br>
  Paris-based energy forum established in 1974. It is linked with the Organisation 
  for Economic Cooperation and Development to enable member countries to take 
  joint measures to meet oil supply emergencies, to share energy information, 
  to coordinate their energy policies, and to cooperate in the development of 
  rational energy programs.</p>

  See <i>standards</i>.</p>
<p><b>Introduced species </b><br>
  A species occurring in an area outside its historically known natural range 
  as a result of accidental dispersal by humans (also referred to as "<i>exotic 
  species</i>" or "alien species").</p>
<p><b>Invasive species</b><br>
  An <i>introduced species</i> that invades natural <i>habitats</i>.</p>
<p><b>Isostatic land movements </b><br>
  Isostasy refers to the way in which the <i>lithosphere </i>and mantle respond 
  to changes in surface loads. When the loading of the lithosphere is changed 
  by alterations in land ice mass, ocean mass, sedimentation, erosion, or mountain 
  building, vertical isostatic adjustment results, in order to balance the new 
  load.</p>
<p><b>Joint Implementation (JI) </b><br>
  A market-based implementation mechanism defined in Article 6 of the <i>Kyoto 
  Protocol</i>, allowing <i>Annex I countries</i> or companies from these countries 
  to implement projects jointly that limit or reduce emissions, or enhance sinks 
  , and to share the <i>Emissions Reduction Units</i>. JI activity is also permitted 
  in Article 4.2(a) of the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i>. 
  See also <i>Activities Implemented Jointly</i> and <i>Kyoto Mechanisms</i>.</p>
<p><b>Known technological options </b><br>
  Refer to technologies that exist in operation or pilot plant stage today. It 
  does not include any new technologies that will require drastic technological 
  breakthroughs.</p>
<p><b>Kyoto Mechanisms </b><br>
  Economic mechanisms based on market principles that Parties to the <i>Kyoto 
  Protocol</i> can use in an attempt to lessen the potential economic impacts 
  of <i>greenhouse gas</i> emission-reduction requirements. They include <i>Joint 
  Implementation</i> (Article 6), the <i>Clean Development Mechanism</i> (Article 
  12), and <i>Emissions Trading</i> (Article 17).</p>
<p><b>Kyoto Protocol </b><br>
  The Kyoto Protocol to the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
  Change</i> (UNFCCC) was adopted at the Third Session of the <i>Conference of 
  the Parties</i> to the UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It contains legally binding 
  commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included 
  in <i>Annex B</i> of the Protocol (most countries in the Organisation for Economic 
  Cooperation and Development, and countries with economies in transition) agreed 
  to reduce their <i>anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, 
  nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride)</i> 
  by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The 
  Kyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force (September 2001).</p>
<p><b>La Ni&ntilde;a</b><br>
  See <i>El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation</i>.</p>
<p><b>Land use </b><br>
  The total of arrangements, activities, and inputs undertaken in a certain land 
  cover type (a set of human actions). The social and economic purposes for which 
  land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction, and conservation).</p>
<p><b>Land-use change </b><br>
  A change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change 
  in land cover. Land cover and land-use change may have an impact on the <i>albedo</i>, 
  <i>evapotranspiration</i>, sources, and <i>sinks</i> of <i>greenhouse gases</i>, 
  or other properties of the <i>climate system</i>, and may thus have an impact 
  on <i>climate</i>, locally or globally. See also the IPCC Special Report on 
  Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000b).</p>
<p><b>Landslide </b><br>
  A mass of material that has slipped downhill by gravity, often assisted by water 
  when the material is saturated; rapid movement of a mass of soil, rock, or debris 
  down a slope.</p>
<p><b>Leakage </b><br>
  The part of <i>emissions</i> reductions in <i>Annex B countries</i> that may 
  be offset by an increase of the emission in the nonconstrained countries above 
  their baseline levels. This can occur through (i) relocation of energy-intensive 
  production in non-constrained regions; (ii) increased consumption of <i>fossil 
  fuels</i> in these regions through decline in the international price of oil 
  and gas triggered by lower demand for these energies; and (iii) changes in incomes 
  (thus in energy demand) because of better terms of trade. Leakage also refers 
  to the situation in which a carbon <i>sequestration</i> activity (e.g., tree 
  planting) on one piece of land inadvertently, directly or indirectly, triggers 
  an activity, which in whole or part, counteracts the carbon effects of the initial 
  activity.</p>
<p><b>Lifetime </b><br>
  Lifetime is a general term used for various <i>time scales</i> characterizing 
  the rate of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases. In general, 
  lifetime denotes the average length of time that an atom or molecule spends 
  in a given <i>reservoir</i>, such as the <i>atmosphere</i> or oceans. The following 
  lifetimes may be distinguished:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Turnover time" (T) or "atmospheric lifetime" is the ratio of the mass M 
    of a reservoir (e.g., a gaseous compound in the <i>atmosphere</i>) and the 
    total rate of removal S from the reservoir: T = M/S. For each removal process 
    separate turnover times can be defined. In soil carbon biology, this is referred 
    to as Mean Residence Time.</li>
  <li>"Adjustment time," "response time," or "perturbation lifetime" (T<sub>a</sub>) 
    is the time scale characterizing the decay of an instantaneous pulse input 
    into the reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterize 
    the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in the source 
    strength. Halflife or decay constant is used to quantify a first-order exponential 
    decay process. See<i> response time</i> for a different definition pertinent 
    to <i>climate</i> variations. The term "lifetime" is sometimes used, for simplicity, 
    as a surrogate for "adjustment time." In simple cases, where the global removal 
    of the compound is directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, 
    the adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = T<sub>a</sub>. An example 
    is CFC-11 which is removed from the atmosphere only by photochemical processes 
    in the <i>stratosphere</i>. In more complicated cases, where several reservoirs 
    are involved or where the removal is not proportional to the total mass, the 
    equality T = T<sub>a</sub> no longer holds. <i>Carbon dioxide</i> is an extreme 
    example. Its turnover time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange 
    between atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part 
    of that CO<sub>2</sub> is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. Thus, 
    the adjustment time of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is actually determined 
    by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into 
    its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years may be given 
    for the adjustment time of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment 
    is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of <i>methane</i>, the 
    adjustment time is different from the turnover time, because the removal is 
    mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical OH, the concentration 
    of which itself depends on the CH<sub>4</sub> concentration. Therefore the 
    CH<sub>4</sub> removal S is not proportional to its total mass M.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Lithosphere </b><br>
  The upper layer of the solid Earth, both continental and oceanic, which is composed 
  of all crustal rocks and the cold, mainly elastic, part of the uppermost mantle. 
  Volcanic activity, although part of the lithosphere, is not considered as part 
  of the <i>climate system</i>, but acts as an <i>external forcing</i> factor.</p>
<p><b>Leapfrogging </b><br>
  Leapfrogging (or technological leapfrogging) refers to the opportunities in 
  developing countries to bypass several stages of technology development, historically 
  observed in industrialized countries, and apply the most advanced presently 
  available technologies in the energy and other economic sectors, through investments 
  in technological development and capacity building.</p>
<p><b>Level of scientific understanding </b><br>
  This is an index on a 4-step scale (High, Medium, Low, and Very Low) designed 
  to characterize the degree of scientific understanding of the <i>radiative forcing</i> 
  agents that affect <i>climate change</i>. For each agent, the index represents 
  a subjective judgement about the reliability of the estimate of its forcing, 
  involving such factors as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, 
  the degree of knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the 
  forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate.</p>
<p><b>Local Agenda 21 </b><br>
  Local Agenda 21s are the local plans for environment and development that each 
  local authority is meant to develop through a consultative process with their 
  populations, with particular attention paid to involving women and youth. Many 
  local authorities have developed Local Agenda 21s through consultative processes 
  as a means of reorienting their policies, plans, and operations towards the 
  achievement of <i>sustainable development</i> goals. The term comes from Chapter 
  28 of Agenda 21-the document formally endorsed by all government representatives 
  attending the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (also 
  known as the Earth Summit) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p>
<p><b>Lock-in technologies and practices </b><br>

  A hydrocarbon that is a<i> greenhouse gas</i> produced through anaerobic (without 
  oxygen) decomposition of waste in landfills, animal digestion, decomposition 
  of animal wastes, production and distribution of natural gas and oil, coal production,

  gases</i> to be mitigated under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>.</p>
<p><b>Methane recovery </b><br>
  Method by which <i>methane emissions</i> (e.g., from coal mines or waste sites) 
  are captured and then reused either as a fuel or for some other economic purpose

<p><b>Meeting of the Parties (to the Kyoto Protocol) (MOP) </b><br>
  The <i>Conference of the Parties </i>of the <i>United Nations Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change </i>will serve as the <i>Meeting of the Parties (MOP)</i>,

<p><b>Mole fraction </b><br>
  Mole fraction, or mixing ratio, is the ratio of the number of moles of a constituent 
  in a given volume to the total number of moles of all constituents in that volume. 
  It is usually reported for dry air. Typical values for long-lived <i>greenhouse 
  gases</i> are in the order of mmol/mol (parts per million: ppm), nmol/mol (parts 
  per billion: ppb), and fmol/mol (parts per trillion: ppt). Mole fraction differs 
  from volume mixing ratio, often expressed in ppmv, etc., by the corrections 
  for non-ideality of gases. This correction is significant relative to measurement 
  precision for many greenhouse gases (Schwartz and Warneck, 1995).</p>

  Convention. See also <i>Annex I countries</i>.</p>
<p><b>Non-linearity </b><br>
  A process is called "non-linear" when there is no simple proportional relation 
  between cause and effect. The<i> climate system</i> contains many such non-linear 
  processes, resulting in a system with a potentially very complex behavior. Such 
  complexity may lead to <i>rapid climate change</i>.</p>

<p><b>North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) </b><br>
  The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations of barometric 
  pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. On average, a westerly current, between 
  the Icelandic low pressure area and the Azores high pressure area, carries cyclones 
  with their associated frontal systems towards Europe. However, the pressure 
  difference between Iceland and the Azores fluctuates on <i>time scales</i> of 
  days to decades, and can be reversed at times. It is the dominant mode of winter 
  <i>climate variability</i> in the North Atlantic region, ranging from central 
  North America to Europe.</p>

<p><b>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) </b><br>
  Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O<sub>3</sub>), is a gaseous atmospheric 
  constituent. In the<i> troposphere</i> it is created both naturally and by photochemical 
  reactions involving gases resulting from human activities (photochemical "smog"). 
  In high concentrations, tropospheric ozone can be harmful to a wide-range of 
  living organisms. Tropospheric ozone acts as a <i>greenhouse gas</i>. In the 
  <i>stratosphere</i>, ozone is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet 
  radiation and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Stratospheric ozone plays a 
  decisive role in the stratospheric <i>radiative balance</i>. Its concentration 
  is highest in the <i>ozone layer</i>. Depletion of stratospheric ozone, due 
  to chemical reactions that may be enhanced by <i>climate change</i>, results 
  in an increased ground-level flux of <i>ultraviolet-B radiation</i>. See also 
  <i>Montreal Protocol</i> and <i>ozone layer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ozone hole</b><br>
  See <i>ozone layer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ozone layer </b><br>
  The <i>stratosphere</i> contains a layer in which the concentration of <i>ozone</i> 
  is greatest, the so-called ozone layer. The layer extends from about 12 to 40 
  km. The ozone concentration reaches a maximum between about 20 and 25 km. This 
  layer is being depleted by human <i>emissions</i> of chlorine and bromine compounds. 
  Every year, during the Southern Hemisphere spring, a very strong depletion of 
  the ozone layer takes place over the Antarctic region, also caused by human-made 
  chlorine and bromine compounds in combination with the specific meteorological 
  conditions of that region. This phenomenon is called the <i>ozone hole</i>.</p>
<p><b>Parameterization </b><br>
  In <i>climate models</i>, this term refers to the technique of representing 
  processes, that cannot be explicitly resolved at the spatial or temporal resolution 
  of the model (sub-grid scale processes), by relationships between the area- 
  or timeaveraged effect of such sub-grid-scale processes and the larger scale 
  flow.</p>
<p><b>Pareto criterion / Pareto optimum </b><br>

  without making others in the society worse off.</p>
<p><b>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) </b><br>
  Among the six <i>greenhouse gases </i>to be abated under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>. 
  These are by-products of aluminum smelting and uranium enrichment. They also 
  replace <i>chlorofluorocarbons</i> in manufacturing semiconductors. The <i>Global 
  Warming Potential</i> of PFCs is 6,500-9,200 times that of <i>carbon dioxide</i>.</p>
<p><b>Permafrost</b><br>

<p><b>Photosynthesis </b><br>
  The process by which plants take <i>carbon dioxide</i> (CO<sub>2</sub>) from 
  the air (or bicarbonate in water) to build carbohydrates, releasing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) 
  in the process. There are several pathways of photosynthesis with different 
  responses to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. See also <i>carbon dioxide 
  fertilization</i>.</p>
<p><b>Phytoplankton </b><br>
  The plant forms of <i>plankton</i> (e.g., diatoms). Phytoplankton are the dominant 
  plants in the sea, and are the bast of the entire marine food web. These single-celled 
  organisms are the principal agents for photosynthetic carbon fixation in the 
  ocean. See also<i> zooplankton</i>.</p>
<p><b>Plankton</b><br>
  Aquatic organisms that drift or swim weakly. See also <i>phytoplankton</i> and

  tunnel, well, container, concentrated animal-feeding operation, or floating 
  craft. See also <i>non-point-source pollution</i>.</p>
<p><b>Policies and measures </b><br>
  In <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i> parlance, "policies" 
  are actions that can be taken and/or mandated by a government-often in conjunction 
  with business and industry within its own country, as well as with other countries-to 
  accelerate the application and use of measures to curb <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i>. 
  "Measures" are technologies, processes, and practices used to implement policies, 
  which, if employed, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions below anticipated 
  future levels. Examples might include carbon or other <i>energy taxes</i>, standardized 
  fuel-efficiency <i>standards</i> for automobiles, etc. "Common and coordinated" 
  or "harmonized" policies refer to those adopted jointly by Parties.</p>

<p><b>Post-glacial rebound </b><br>
  The vertical movement of the continents and sea floor following the disappearance 
  and shrinking of<i> ice sheets</i>-for example, since the Last Glacial Maximum 
  (21 ky BP). The rebound is an <i>isostatic land movement</i>.</p>
<p><b>Precursors </b><br>
  Atmospheric compounds which themselves are not <i>greenhouse gases</i> or <i>aerosols</i>, 
  but which have an effect on greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations by taking 
  part in physical or chemical processes regulating their production or destruction 
  rates.</p>
<p><b>Pre-industrial</b><br>
  See<i> Industrial Revolution</i>.</p>
<p><b>Present value cost</b><br>
  The sum of all costs over all time periods, with future costs discounted.</p>
<p><b>Primary energy </b><br>
  Energy embodied in natural<i> resources </i>(e.g., coal, crude oil, sunlight, 
  uranium) that has not undergone any <i>anthropogenic</i> conversion or transformation.</p>
<p><b>Private cost </b><br>
  Categories of costs influencing an individual's decision making are referred 
  to as private costs. See also <i>social cost </i>and<i> total cost</i>.</p>
<p><b>Profile </b><br>
  A smoothly changing set of concentrations representing a possible pathway towards 
  stabilization. The word "profile"is used to distinguish such pathways from emissions 
  pathways, which are usually referred to as "<i>scenarios</i>."</p>
<p><b>Projection (generic) </b><br>
  A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, 
  often computed with the aid of a model. Projections are distinguished from "predictions" 
  in order to emphasize that projections involve assumptions concerning, for example, 
  future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be 
  realized, and are therefore subject to substantial<i> uncertainty</i>. See also 
  <i>climate projection </i>and <i>climate prediction</i>.</p>
<p><b>Proxy </b><br>
  A proxy<i> climate</i> indicator is a local record that is interpreted, using 
  physical and biophysical principles, to represent some combination of climate-related 
  variations back in time. Climate-related data derived in this way are referred 
  to as proxy data. Examples of proxies are tree ring records, characteristics 
  of corals, and various data derived from ice cores.</p>
<p><b>Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) </b><br>
  Estimates of <i>Gross Domestic Product </i>based on the purchasing power of 
  currencies rather than on current exchange rates. Such estimates are a blend 
  of extrapolated and regression-based numbers, using the results of the International 
  Comparison Program. PPP estimates tend to lower per capita GDPs in industrialized 
  countries and raise per capita GDPs in developing countries. PPP is also an 
  acronym for polluter-pays-principle.</p>
<p><b>Radiative balance</b><br>
  See <i>energy balance</i>.</p>
<p><b>Radiative forcing </b><br>
  Radiative forcing is the change in the net vertical irradiance (expressed in 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>) at the <i>tropopause</i> due to an internal change or a change 
  in the external forcing of the<i> climate system</i>, such as, for example, 
  a change in the concentration of <i>carbon dioxide </i>or the output of the 
  Sun. Usually radiative forcing is computed after allowing for stratospheric 
  temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, but with all tropospheric 
  properties held fixed at their unperturbed values.</p>
<p><b>Radiative forcing scenario </b><br>
  A plausible representation of the future development of <i>radiative forcing</i> 
  associated, for example, with changes in atmospheric composition or land-use 
  change, or with external factors such as variations in <i>solar activity</i>.Radiative forcing scenarios can be used as input into simplified <i>climate 
  models </i>to compute <i>climate projections</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rangeland</b><br>
  Unimproved grasslands, shrublands, savannahs, and tundra.</p>
<p><b>Rapid climate change </b><br>
  The non-linearity of the <i>climate system</i> may lead to rapid <i>climate 
  change</i>, sometimes called abrupt events or even surprises. Some such abrupt 
  events may be imaginable, such as a dramatic reorganization of the <i>thermohaline 
  circulation</i>, rapid deglaciation, or massive melting of <i>permafrost</i> 
  leading to fast changes in the <i>carbon cycle</i>. Others may be truly unexpected, 
  as a consequence of a strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a non-linear system.</p>
<p> <b>Rebound effect </b><br>
  Occurs because, for example, an improvement in motor efficiency lowers the cost 
  per kilometer driven; it has the perverse effect of encouraging more trips.</p>

  See <i>baseline</i>.</p>
<p><b>Reforestation </b><br>
  Planting of <i>forests </i>on lands that have previously contained forests but 
  that have been converted to some other use. For a discussion of the term forest 
  and related terms such as <i>afforestation</i>, <i>reforestation</i>, and <i>deforestation</i>, 
  see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 
  2000b).</p>

  Rules or codes enacted by governments that mandate product specifications or 
  process performance characteristics. See also <i>standards</i>.</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> <br>
  The transfer of a portion of primary insurance risks to a secondary tier of 
  insurers (reinsurers); essentially "insurance for insurers."</p>
<p><b>Relative sea level </b><br>
  Sea level measured by a <i>tide gauge</i> with respect to the land upon which 
  it is situated. See also <i>Mean Sea Level.</i></p>
<p><b>(Relative) Sea level secular change </b><br>
  Long-term changes in relative sea level caused by either eustatic changes (e.g., 
  brought about by <i>thermal expansion</i>) or changes in vertical land movements.</p>
<p><b>Renewables </b><br>
  Energy sources that are, within a short time frame relative to the Earth's natural 
  cycles, sustainable, and include noncarbon technologies such as solar energy, 
  hydropower, and wind, as well as carbon-neutral technologies such as <i>biomass</i>.</p>
<p><b>Research, development, and demonstration </b><br>
  Scientific and/or technical research and development of new production processes 
  or products, coupled with analysis and measures that provide information to 
  potential users regarding the application of the new product or process; demonstration 
  tests; and feasibility of applying these products processes via pilot plants 
  and other pre-commercial applications.</p>
<p><b>Reserves </b><br>
  Refer to those occurrences that are identified and measured as economically 
  and technically recoverable with current technologies and prices. See also <i>resources</i>.</p>
<p><b>Reservoir </b><br>
  A component of the <i>climate system</i>, other than the <i>atmosphere</i>, 
  which has the capacity to store, accumulate, or release a substance of concern 
  (e.g., carbon, a <i>greenhouse gas</i>, or a <i>precursor</i>). Oceans, soils, 
  and <i>forests</i> are examples of reservoirs of carbon. Pool is an equivalent 
  term (note that the definition of pool often includes the atmosphere). The absolute 
  quantity of substance of concerns, held within a reservoir at a specified time, 
  is called the stock. The term also means an artificial or natural storage place 
  for water, such as a lake, pond, or <i>aquifer</i>, from which the water may 
  be withdrawn for such purposes as irrigation, water supply, or irrigation.</p>
<p><b>Resilience</b><br>
  Amount of change a system can undergo without changing state.</p>
<p><b>Resource base</b><br>
  Resource base includes both <i>reserves </i>and <i>resources</i>.</p>
<p><b>Resources </b><br>
  Resources are those occurrences with less certain geological and/or economic 
  characteristics, but which are considered potentially recoverable with foreseeable 
  technological and economic developments.</p>
<p><b>Respiration </b><br>
  The process whereby living organisms converts organic matter to <i>carbon dioxide</i>, 
  releasing energy and consuming oxygen.</p>
<p><b>Response time </b><br>
  The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for the <i>climate system</i> 
  or its components to re-equilibrate to a new state, following a forcing resulting 
  from external and internal processes or<i> feedbacks</i>. It is very different 
  for various components of the climate system. The response time of the<i> troposphere</i> 
  is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the<i> stratosphere</i> comes 
  into equilibrium on a <i>time scale</i> of typically a few months. Due to their 
  large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer response time, typically 
  decades, but up to centuries or millennia. The response time of the strongly 
  coupled surface-troposphere system is, therefore, slow compared to that of the 
  stratosphere, and mainly determined by the oceans. The <i>biosphere </i>may 
  respond fast (e.g., to <i>droughts</i>), but also very slowly to imposed changes. 
  See<i> lifetime </i>for a different definition of response time pertinent to 
  the rate of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases.</p>
<p><b>Revenue recycling</b><br>

  The carbon dioxide concentration <i>profiles</i> leading to stabilization defined 
  in the IPCC 1994 assessment (Enting <i>et al</i>., 1994; Schimel<i> et al</i>.,

  A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, 
  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving 
  forces (e.g., rate of <i>technology</i> change, prices) and relationships. Scenarios 
  are neither predictions nor forecasts and sometimes may be based on a "narrative 
  storyline." Scenarios may be derived from <i>projections</i>, but are often 
  based on additional information from other sources. See also <i>SRES scenarios</i>, 
  <i>climate scenario</i>, and <i>emission scenarios</i>.</p>
<p><b>Sea-level rise</b> <br>
  An increase in the mean level of the ocean. Eustatic sea-level rise is a change 
  in global average sea level brought about by an alteration to the volume of 
  the world ocean. <i>Relative sea-level</i> rise occurs where there is a net 
  increase in the level of the ocean relative to local land movements. Climate 
  modelers largely concentrate on estimating eustatic sea-level change. <i>Impact</i> 
  researchers focus on relative sea-level change.</p>

  <i>Ecosystems </i>that have more than 250 mm precipitation per year but are 
  not highly productive; usually classified as<i> rangelands</i>.</p>
<p><b>Sensitivity </b><br>
  Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or 
  beneficially, by climate-related <i>stimuli</i>. The effect may be direct (e.g., 
  a change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range, or variability 
  of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused by an increase in the frequency 
  of coastal flooding due to <i>sea-level rise</i>). See also <i>climate sensitivity</i>.</p>
<p> <b>Sequential decision making </b><br>

  than the <i>atmosphere</i>. Biological approaches to sequestration include direct 
  removal of <i>carbon dioxide</i> from the atmosphere through <i>land-use</i>

  enhance soil carbon in agriculture. Physical approaches include separation and 
  disposal of carbon dioxide from flue gases or from processing <i>fossil fuels</i> 
  to produce hydrogen- and carbon dioxide - rich fractions and long-term storage 
  in underground in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams, and saline<i> 
  aquifers</i>. See also <i>uptake</i>.</p>

<p><b>Social cost </b><br>
  The social cost of an activity includes the <i>value</i> of all the<i> resources</i> 
  used in its provision. Some of these are priced and others are not. Non-priced 
  resources are referred to as externalities. It is the sum of the costs of these 
  externalities and the priced resources that makes up the social cost. See also 
  <i>private</i> cost and <i>total cost</i>.</p>

  (100,000 to 10 million km<sup>2</sup>) to continental (10 to 100 million km<sup>2</sup>). 
  Temporal scales may range from seasonal to geological (up to hundreds of millions 
  of years).</p>

  sound technology</i> and other issues.</p>
<p><b>SRES scenarios </b><br>
  SRES scenarios are <i>emissions scenarios</i> developed by Nakicenovic et al. 
  (2000) and used, among others, as a basis for the <i>climate projections</i> 
  in the IPCC WGI contribution to the Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a). The 
  following terms are relevant for a better understanding of the structure and 
  use of the set of SRES scenarios: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i><b>(Scenario) Family</b></i>: Scenarios that have a similar demographic, 
    societal, economic, and technical-change <i>storyline</i>. Four scenario families 
    comprise the SRES scenario set: A1, A2, B1, and B2.</li>
  <li><i><b>(Scenario) Group</b></i>: Scenarios within a family that reflect a 
    consistent variation of the storyline. The A1 scenario family includes four 
    groups designated as A1T, A1C, A1G, and A1B that explore alternative structures 
    of future energy systems. In the Summary for Policymakers of Nakicenovic et 
    al. (2000), the A1C and A1G groups have been combined into one "Fossil-Intensive" 
    A1FI scenario group. The other three scenario families consist of one group 
    each. The SRES scenario set reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakicenovic 
    et al. (2000) thus consist of six distinct <i>scenario groups</i>, all of 
    which are equally sound and together capture the range of uncertainties associated 
    with driving forces and emissions.</li>
  <li><i><b>Illustrative Scenario</b></i>: A scenario that is illustrative for 
    each of the six<i> scenario groups</i> reflected in the Summary for Policymakers 
    of Nakicenovic et al. (2000). They include four revised <i>scenario markers</i> 
    for the <i>scenario groups</i> A1B, A2, B1, B2, and two additional scenarios 
    for the A1FI and A1T groups. All <i>scenario groups</i> are equally sound.</li>
  <li><i><b>(Scenario) Marker</b></i>: A scenario that was originally posted in 
    draft form on the SRES website to represent a given <i>scenario family</i>. 
    The choice of markers was based on which of the initial quantifications best 
    reflected the storyline, and the features of specific models. Markers are 
    no more likely than other scenarios, but are considered by the SRES writing 
    team as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in revised 
    form in Nakicenovic et al. (2000). These scenarios have received the closest 
    scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES open process. Scenarios 
    have also been selected to illustrate the other two <i>scenario groups</i>.</li>
  <li><i><b>(Scenario) Storyline</b></i>: A narrative description of a scenario 
    (or family of scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships 
    between key driving forces, and the dynamics of their evolution.</li>
</ul>

  product and/or<i> technology </i>or performance standards establish minimum 
  requirements for affected products and/or technologies in countries where they 
  are adopted. The standards reduce <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> associated 
  with the manufacture or use of the products and/or application of the technology. 
  See also <i>regulatory measures</i>.</p>
<p><b>Stimuli (climate-related) </b><br>

<p><b>Storm surge</b> <br>
  The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due

<p><b>Structural change </b><br>
  Changes, for example, in the relative share of <i>Gross Domestic Product </i>produced

  with little or no horizontal motion.</p>
<p><b>Subsidy </b><br>
  Direct payment from the government to an entity, or a tax reduction to that

  gas emissions</i> can be reduced by lowering existing subsidies that have the 
  effect of raising emissions, such as subsidies to <i>fossil-fuel</i> use, or 
  by providing subsidies for practices that reduce emissions or enhance <i>sinks</i> 
  (e.g., for insulation of buildings or planting trees).</p>
<p><b>Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) </b><br>
  One of the six <i>greenhouse gases</i> to be curbed under the <i>Kyoto Protocol</i>. 
  It is largely used in heavy industry to insulate high-voltage equipment and

  runoff of a drainage <i>basin</i> that has not passed beneath the surface since 
  precipitation.</p>
<p><b>Sustainable development </b><br>
  Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
  of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
<p><b>Targets and time tables </b><br>
  A target is the reduction of a specific percentage of <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> 
  from a <i>baseline</i> date (e.g., "below 1990 levels") to be achieved by a 
  set date or time table (e.g., 2008 to 2012). For example, under the <i>Kyoto 
  Protocol's</i> formula, the European Union has agreed to reduce its <i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i> by 8% below 1990 levels by the 2008 to 2012 commitment period. 
  These targets and time tables are, in effect, an emissions cap on the total 
  amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by a country or region 
  in a given time period.</p>

  across and within countries.</p>
<p><b>Thermal erosion</b><br>
  The <i>erosion</i> of ice-rich<i> permafrost</i> by the combined thermal and 
  mechanical action of moving water.</p>
<p><b>Thermal expansion </b><br>
  In connection with sea level, this refers to the increase in volume (and decrease 
  in density) that results from warming water. A warming of the ocean leads to 
  an expansion of the ocean volume and hence an increase in sea level.</p>
<p><b>Thermohaline circulation </b><br>
  Large-scale density-driven circulation in the ocean, caused by differences in 
  temperature and salinity. In the North Atlantic, the thermohaline circulation 
  consists of warm surface water flowing northward and cold deepwater flowing 
  southward, resulting in a net poleward transport of heat. The surface water 
  sinks in highly restricted sinking regions located in high latitudes.</p>
<p><b>Thermokarst</b><br>
  Irregular, hummocky topography in frozen ground caused by melting of ice.</p>
<p><b>Tide gauge </b><br>
  A device at a coastal location (and some deep sea locations) which continuously 
  measures the level of the sea with respect to the adjacent land. Time-averaging 
  of the sea level so recorded gives the observed<i> relative sea level secular 
  changes</i>.</p>
<p><b>Time scale </b><br>
  Characteristic time for a process to be expressed. Since many processes exibit 
  most of their effects early, and then have a long period during which they gradually 
  approach full expression, for the purpose of this report the time scale is numerically 
  defined as the time required for a perturbation in a process to show at least 
  half of its final effect.</p>
<p><b>Tolerable-windows approach </b><br>
  These approaches analyze <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> as they would be constrained 
  by adopting a long-term<i> climate</i>-rather than greenhouse gas concentration 
  <i>stabilization</i>-target (e.g., expressed in terms of temperature or sea 
  level changes or the rate of such changes). The main objective of these approaches 
  is to evaluate the implications of such long-term targets for short- or medium-term 
  "tolerable" ranges of global <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i>. Also referred 
  to as safe-landing approaches.</p>
<p><b>Top-down models </b><br>
  The terms "top" and "bottom" are shorthand for aggregate and disaggregated models. 
  The top-down label derives from how modelers applied macro-economic theory and 
  econometric techniques to historical data on consumption, prices, incomes, and 
  factor costs to model final demand for goods and services, and supply from main 
  sectors, like the energy sector, transportation, agriculture, and industry. 
  Therefore, top-down models evaluate the system from aggregate economic variables, 
  as compared to <i>bottom-up models</i> that consider technological options or 
  project specific <i>climate change mitigation</i> policies. Some technology 
  data were, however, integrated into top-down analysis and so the distinction 
  is not that clear-cut.</p>
<p><b>Total cost </b><br>
  All items of cost added together. The total cost to society is made up of both 
  the <i>external cost</i> and the <i>private cost</i>, which together are defined 
  as<i> social cost</i>.</p>
<p><b>Trade effects </b><br>
  Economic impacts of changes in the purchasing power of a bundle of exported 
  goods of a country for bundles of goods imported from its trade partners. Climate 
  policies change the relative production costs and may change terms of trade 
  substantially enough to change the ultimate economic balance.</p>
<p><b>Transient climate response </b><br>
  The globally averaged surface air temperature increase, averaged over a 20-year 
  period, centered at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling (i.e., at year 70 in 
  a 1% per year compound CO<sub>2</sub> increase experiment with a global coupled 
  <i>climate model</i>).</p>
<p><b>Tropopause</b><br>
  The boundary between the <i>troposphere </i>and the <i>stratosphere</i>.</p>
<p><b>Troposphere </b><br>
  The lowest part of the <i>atmosphere</i> from the surface to about 10 km in 
  altitude in mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km in high latitudes to 16 km in the 
  tropics on average) where clouds and "weather" phenomena occur. In the troposphere, 
  temperatures generally decrease with height.</p>
<p><b>Tundra</b><br>
  A treeless, level, or gently undulating plain characteristic of arctic and subarctic 
  regions.</p>
<p><b>Turnover time</b><br>
  See <i>lifetim</i>e.</p>
<p><b>Ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation </b><br>
  <i>Solar radiation</i> within a wavelength range of 280-320 nm, the greater 
  part of which is absorbed by stratospheric ozone. Enhanced UV-B radiation suppresses 
  the immune system and can have other adverse effects on living organisms.</p>
<p><b>Uncertainty </b><br>
  An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the 
  <i>climate system</i>) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information 
  or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many 
  types of sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined 
  concepts or terminology, or uncertain <i>projections</i> of human behavior. 
  Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (e.g., a range 
  of values calculated by various models) or by qualitative statements (e.g., 
  reflecting the judgment of a team of experts). See Moss and Schneider (2000).</p>
<p><b>Undernutrition </b><br>
  The result of food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements 
  continuously, poor absorption, and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed.</p>
<p><b>Unique and threatened systems </b><br>
  Entities that are confined to a relatively narrow geographical range but can 
  affect other, often larger entities beyond their range; narrow geographical 
  range points to <i>sensitivity</i> to environmental variables, including <i>climate</i>, 
  and therefore attests to potential <i>vulnerability</i> to <i>climate change</i>.</p>
<p><b>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) </b><br>
  The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 
  Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Community. 
  Its ultimate objective is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations 
  in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system." It contains commitments for all Parties. Under the 
  Convention, Parties included in <i>Annex I </i>aim to return <i>greenhouse gas 
  emissions</i> not controlled by the <i>Montreal Protocol</i> to 1990 levels 
  by the year 2000. The Convention entered into force in March 1994. See also 
  <i>Kyoto Protocol </i>and <i>Conference of the Parties</i> (COP).</p>
<p><b>Uptake </b><br>
  The addition of a substance of concern to a<i> reservoir</i>. The uptake of 
  carbon-containing substances, in particular <i>carbon dioxide</i>, is often 
  called (carbon) <i>sequestration</i>. See also <i>sequestration</i>.</p>
<p><b>Upwelling</b><br>
  Transport of deeper water to the surface, usually caused by horizontal movements 
  of surface water.</p>
<p><b>Urbanization </b><br>
  The conversion of land from a natural state or managed natural state (such as 
  agriculture) to cities; a process driven by net rural-to-urban migration through 
  which an increasing percentage of the population in any nation or region come 
  to live in settlements that are defined as "urban centres."</p>
<p><b>Value added</b><br>
  The net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate 
  inputs.</p>
<p><b>Values </b><br>
  Worth, desirability, or utility based on individual preferences. The total value 
  of any resource is the sum of the values of the different individuals involved 
  in the use of the resource. The values, which are the foundation of the estimation 
  of costs, are measured in terms of the willingness to pay (WTP) by individuals 
  to receive the resource or by the willingness of individuals to accept payment 
  (WTA) to part with the resource.</p>
<p><b>Vector</b><br>
  An organism, such as an insect, that transmits a pathogen from one host to another. 
  See also<i> vector-borne diseases</i>.</p>
<p><b>Vector-borne diseases </b><br>
  Disease that is transmitted between hosts by a <i>vector</i> organism such as 
  a mosquito or tick (e.g., <i>malaria</i>, <i>dengue fever</i>, and leishmaniasis).</p>
<p><b>Volume mixing ratio</b><br>
  See <i>mole fraction</i>.</p>
<p><b>Voluntary agreement </b><br>
  An agreement between a government authority and one or more private parties, 
  as well as a unilateral commitment that is recognized by the public authority, 
  to achieve environmental objectives or to improve environmental performance 
  beyond <i>compliance</i>.</p>
<p><b>Vulnerability </b><br>
  The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse 
  effects of <i>climate change</i>, including <i>climate variability</i> and extremes. 
  Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate 
  variation to which a system is exposed, its <i>sensitivity</i>, and its <i>adaptive 
  capacity</i>.</p>
<p><b>Water stress </b><br>
  A country is water-stressed if the available freshwater supply relative to water 
  withdrawals acts as an important constraint on development. Withdrawals exceeding 
  20% of renewable water supply has been used as an indicator of water stress.</p>
<p><b>Water-use efficiency </b><br>
  Carbon gain in <i>photosynthesis</i> per unit water lost in <i>evapotranspiration</i>. 
  It can be expressed on a short-term basis as the ratio of photosynthetic carbon 
  gain per unit transpirational water loss, or on a seasonal basis as the ratio 
  of <i>net primary production</i> or agricultural yield to the amount of available 
  water.</p>
<p><b>Water withdrawal</b><br>
  Amount of water extracted from water bodies.</p>
<p><b>WRE profiles </b><br>
  The carbon dioxide concentration <i>profiles</i> leading to stabilization defined 
  by Wigley, Richels, and Edmonds (1996) whose initials provide the acronym. For 
  any given stabilization level, these profiles span a wide range of possibilities. 
  See also <i>S profiles</i>.</p>
<p><b>Zooplankton</b><br>
  The animal forms of <i>plankton</i>. They consume <i>phytoplankton</i> or other<i> 
  zooplankton</i>. See also <i>phytoplankton</i>.</p>
