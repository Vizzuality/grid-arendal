<h1><a name="a"></a>A. Introduction</h1>
<h2><a name="a1"></a>A.1 The IPCC and its Working Groups</h2>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the World 
Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) in 1988. The aim was, and remains, to provide an assessment of the understanding 
of all aspects of climate change<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>, 
including how human activities can cause such changes and can be impacted by them. 
It had become widely recognised that human-influenced emissions of greenhouse 
gases have the potential to alter the climate system (see <a href="#box1">Box 
1</a>), with possible deleterious or beneficial effects. It was also recognised 
that addressing such global issues required organisation on a global scale, including 
assessment of the understanding of the issue by the worldwide expert communities.<br>
<p>At its first session, the IPCC was organised into three Working Groups. The 
  current remits of the Working Groups are for Working Group I to address the 
  scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change, Working Group II 
  to address the impacts of and adaptations to climate change, and Working Group 
  III to address the options for the mitigation of climate change. The IPCC provided 
  its first major assessment report in 1990 and its second major assessment report 
  in 1996.</p>
<p>The IPCC reports are (i) up-to-date descriptions of the knowns and unknowns 
  of the climate system and related factors, (ii) based on the knowledge of the 
  international expert communities, (iii) produced by an open and peer-reviewed 
  professional process, and (iv) based upon scientific publications whose findings 
  are summarised in terms useful to decision makers. While the assessed information 
  is policy relevant, the IPCC does not establish or advocate public policy.</p>
<p>The scope of the assessments of Working Group I includes observations of the 
  current changes and trends in the climate system, a reconstruction of past changes 
  and trends, an understanding of the processes involved in those changes, and 
  the incorporation of this knowledge into models that can attribute the causes 
  of changes and that can provide simulation of natural and human-induced future 
  changes in the climate system.</p>

      <p><b>Box 1: What drives changes in climate?</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the surface. This 
        energy is then redistributed by the atmospheric and oceanic circulations 
        and radiated back to space at longer (infrared) wavelengths. For the annual 
        mean and for the Earth as a whole, the incoming solar radiation energy 
        is balanced approximately by the outgoing terrestrial radiation. Any factor 
        that alters the radiation received from the Sun or lost to space, or that 
        alters the redistribution of energy within the atmosphere and between 
        the atmosphere, land, and ocean, can affect climate. A change in the net 
        radiative energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere system is termed 
        here, and in previous IPCC reports, a radiative forcing. Positive radiative 
        forcings tend to warm the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Negative 
        radiative forcings tend to cool them.</p>
      <p>Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases will reduce the efficiency 
        with which the Earth's surface radiates to space. More of the outgoing 
        terrestrial radiation from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere and 
        re-emitted at higher altitudes and lower temperatures. This results in 
        a positive radiative forcing that tends to warm the lower atmosphere and 
        surface. Because less heat escapes to space, this is the enhanced greenhouse 
        effect - an enhancement of an effect that has operated in the Earth's 
        atmosphere for billions of years due to the presence of naturally occurring 
        greenhouse gases: water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and nitrous 
        oxide. The amount of radiative forcing depends on the size of the increase 
        in concentration of each greenhouse gas, the radiative properties of the 
        gases involved, and the concentrations of other greenhouse gases already 
        present in the atmosphere. Further, many greenhouse gases reside in the 
        atmosphere for centuries after being emitted, thereby introducing a long-term 
        commitment to positive radiative forcing.</p>
      <p>Anthropogenic aerosols (microscopic airborne particles or droplets) in 
        the troposphere, such as those derived from fossil fuel and biomass burning, 
        can reflect solar radiation, which leads to a cooling tendency in the 
        climate system. Because it can absorb solar radiation, black carbon (soot) 
        aerosol tends to warm the climate system. In addition, changes in aerosol 
        concentrations can alter cloud amount and cloud reflectivity through their 
        effect on cloud properties and lifetimes. In most cases, tropospheric 
        aerosols tend to produce a negative radiative forcing and a cooler climate. 
        They have a much shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse 
        gases (decades to centuries), and, as a result, their concentrations respond 
        much more quickly to changes in emissions.</p>
      <p>Volcanic activity can inject large amounts of sulphur-containing gases 
        (primarily sulphur dioxide) into the stratosphere, which are transformed 
        into sulphate aerosols. Individual eruptions can produce a large, but 
        transitory, negative radiative forcing, tending to cool the Earth's 
        surface and lower atmosphere over periods of a few years.</p>
      <p>The Sun's output of energy varies by small amounts (0.1%) over an 
        11-year cycle and, in addition, variations over longer periods may occur. 
        On time-scales of tens to thousands of years, slow variations in the Earth's 
        orbit, which are well understood, have led to changes in the seasonal 
        and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation. These changes have played 
        an important part in controlling the variations of climate in the distant 
        past, such as the glacial and inter-glacial cycles.</p>
      <p>When radiative forcing changes, the climate system responds on various 
        time-scales. The longest of these are due to the large heat capacity of 
        the deep ocean and dynamic adjustment of the ice sheets. This means that 
        the transient response to a change (either positive or negative) may last 
        for thousands of years. Any changes in the radiative balance of the Earth, 
        including those due to an increase in greenhouse gases or in aerosols, 
        will alter the global hydrological cycle and atmospheric and oceanic circulation, 
        thereby affecting weather patterns and regional temperatures and precipitation.</p>
      <p>Any human-induced changes in climate will be embedded in a background 
        of natural climatic variations that occur on a whole range of time- and 
        space-scales. Climate variability can occur as a result of natural changes 
        in the forcing of the climate system, for example variations in the strength 
        of the incoming solar radiation and changes in the concentrations of aerosols 
        arising from volcanic eruptions. Natural climate variations can also occur 
        in the absence of a change in external forcing, as a result of complex 
        interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling 
        between the atmosphere and ocean. The El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation 
        (ENSO) phenomenon is an example of such natural "internal" variability 
        on interannual time-scales. To distinguish anthropogenic climate changes 
        from natural variations, it is necessary to identify the anthropogenic 
        "signal" against the background "noise" of natural 
        climate variability.</p>

<h2>A.2 The First and Second Assessment Reports of Working Group I</h2>
In the First Assessment Report in 1990, Working Group I broadly described the 
status of the understanding of the climate system and climate change that had 
been gained over the preceding decades of research. Several major points were 
emphasised. The greenhouse effect is a natural feature of the planet, and its 
fundamental physics is well understood. The atmospheric abundances of greenhouse 
gases were increasing, due largely to human activities. Continued future growth 
in greenhouse gas emissions was predicted to lead to significant increases in 
the average surface temperature of the planet, increases that would exceed the 
natural variation of the past several millennia and that could be reversed only 
slowly. The past century had, at that time, seen a surface warming of nearly 0.5&deg;C, 
which was broadly consistent with that predicted by climate models for the greenhouse 
gas increases, but was also comparable to what was then known about natural variation. 
Lastly, it was pointed out that the current level of understanding at that time 
and the existing capabilities of climate models limited the prediction of changes 
in the climate of specific regions.<br>
<p>Based on the results of additional research and Special Reports produced in 
  the interim, IPCC Working Group I assessed the new state of understanding in 
  its Second Assessment Report (SAR<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>) 
  in 1996. The report underscored that greenhouse gas abundances continued to 
  increase in the atmosphere and that very substantial cuts in emissions would 
  be required for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere 
  (which is the ultimate goal of Article 2 of the Framework Convention on Climate 
  Change). Further, the general increase in global temperature continued, with 
  recent years being the warmest since at least 1860. The ability of climate models 
  to simulate observed events and trends had improved, particularly with the inclusion 
  of sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone as radiative forcing agents in 
  climate models. Utilising this simulative capability to compare to the observed 
  patterns of regional temperature changes, the report concluded that the ability 
  to quantify the human influence on global climate was limited. The limitations 
  arose because the expected signal was still emerging from the noise of natural 
  variability and because of uncertainties in other key factors. Nevertheless, 
  the report also concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible 
  human influence on global climate". Lastly, based on a range of scenarios 
  of future greenhouse gas abundances, a set of responses of the climate system 
  was simulated.</p>

<h2>A.3 The Third Assessment Report: This Technical Summary</h2>
The third major assessment report of IPCC Working Group I builds upon these past 
assessments and incorporates the results of the past five years of climate research. 
This Technical Summary is based on the underlying information of the chapters, 
which is cross-referenced in the Source Notes in the Appendix. This Summary aims 
to describe the major features (see <a href="#figTechSum1">Figure 1</a>) of the 
understanding of the climate system and climate change at the outset of the 21st 
century. Specifically:<br>
<ul>
  <li>What does the observational record show with regard to past climate changes, 
    both globally and regionally and both on the average and in the extremes? 
    (<a href="082.htm">Section B</a>) 
  <li>How quantitative is the understanding of the agents that cause climate to 
    change, including both those that are natural (e.g., solar variation) and 
    human-related (e.g., greenhouse gases) phenomena? (<a href="085.htm">Section 
    C</a>)
<li>What is the current ability to simulate the responses of the climate system 
    to these forcing agents? In particular, how well are key physical and biogeochemical 
    processes described by present global climate models? (<a href="091.htm">Section 
    D</a>)
<li>Based on today's observational data and today's climate predictive capabilities, 
    what does the comparison show regarding a human influence on today's climate? 
    (<a href="095.htm">Section E</a>)
<li>Further, using current predictive tools, what could the possible climate 
    future be? Namely, for a wide spectrum of projections for several climate-forcing 
    agents, what does current understanding project for global temperatures, regional 
    patterns of precipitation, sea levels, and changes in extremes? (<a href="099.htm">Section 
    F</a>)<br>
</ul>
<i>Finally, what are the most urgent research activities that need to be addressed 
to improve our understanding of the climate system and to reduce our uncertainty 
regarding future climate change?</i><br>
<p>The Third Assessment Report of IPCC Working Group I is the product of hundreds 
of scientists from the developed and developing world who contributed to its preparation 
and review. What follows is a summary of their understanding of the climate system.</p>
