        for addressing climate change, the TAR provides an assessment of the potential 
        for achieving different levels of concentrations through mitigation and 
        information about how adaptation can reduce vulnerability. </b>The causality 
        works in both directions. Different stabilization levels result from different 
        emission scenarios, which are connected to underlying development paths. 
        In turn, these development paths strongly affect adaptive capacity in 
        any region. In this way adaptation and mitigation strategies are dynamically 
        connected with changes in the climate system and the prospects for ecosystem 
        adaptation, food production, and sustainable economic development. <br>

        <p>An integrated view of climate change considers the dynamics of the 
          complete cycle of interlinked causes and effects across all sectors 
          concerned. <a href="018.htm#figspm1-1">Figure 1-1</a> shows the cycle, 
          from the underlying driving forces of population, economy, technology, 
          and governance, through greenhouse gas and other emissions, changes 
          in the physical climate system, biophysical and human impacts, to adaptation 
          and mitigation, and back to the driving forces. The figure presents 
          a schematic view of an ideal "integrated assessment" framework, 
          in which all the parts of the climate change problem interact mutually. 
          Changes in one part of the cycle influence other components in a dynamic 
          manner, through multiple paths. The TAR assesses new policy-relevant 
          information and evidence with regard to all quadrants of <a href="018.htm#figspm1-1">Figure 
          1-1</a>. In particular, a new contribution has been to fill in the bottom 
          righthand quadrant of the figure by exploring alternative development 
          paths and their relationship to greenhouse gas emissions, and by undertaking 
          preliminary work on the linkage between adaptation, mitigation, and 
          development paths. However, the TAR does not achieve a fully integrated 
          assessment of climate change, because of the incomplete state of knowledge.<br>

        There are multiple links. Economic development affectsecosystem balance

        energy-intensive life styles and continued high levels of consumption 
        supported by non-renewable resources and rapid population growth are not 
        likely to be consistent with sustainable developmentpaths; and extreme 
        socio-economic inequality within communities and between nations may undermine 
        the social cohesion that would promote sustainability and make policy 
        responses more effective. At the same time, socio-economic and technology 
        policy decisions made for non-climate-related reasons have significant 
        implications for climate policy andclimate change impacts, as well as 
        for other environmental issues (see <a href="059.htm">Question 8</a>). 
        In addition, critical impact thresholds and vulnerability to climate change 
        impacts are directly connected to environmental, social, and economic

        This occurs because of the impacts of natural climate variation and changes, 
        climate policy responses, and associated socio-economic development will 
        affect the ability of countries to achieve sustainable development goals,

        for, and success of, climate policies. In particular, the socio-economic 
        and technological characteristics of different development paths will 
        strongly affect emissions, the rate and magnitude of climate change, climate 
        change impacts, the capability to adapt, and the capacity to mitigate 
        climate. The <em>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</em> (SRES, see

      <b><a name="figspm11"></a></b><strong>Figure 1-1: Climate 
      change- an integrated framework.</strong> Schematic and simplified 
      representation of an integrated assessment framework for considering anthropogenic 
      climate change. The yellow arrows show a full clockwise cycle of cause and 
      effect among the four quadrants shown in the figure, while the blue arrow 
      indicates the societal response to climate change impacts. For both developed 
      and developing countries, each <strong>socio-economic development path</strong> 
      explored in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios has driving forces 
      which give rise to emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and precursors -- with 
      carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ) being the most important. The greenhouse 
      gas <strong>emissions accumulate in the atmosphere, changing concentrations 
      </strong>and disturbing the natural balances, depending on physical processes 
      such as solar radiation, cloud formation, and rainfall. The aerosols also 
      give rise to air pollution (e.g., acid rain) that damage human and the natural 
      systems (not shown). The enhanced greenhouse effect will initiate <strong>climate 
      changes </strong>well into the future with associated <strong>impacts on 
      the natural and human systems</strong>. There is a possibility of some feedback 
      between the changes in these systems and the climate (not shown), such as 
      albedo effects from changing land use, and other, perhaps larger, interactions 
      between the systems and atmospheric emissions (e.g., effects of changes 
      in land use (again not shown)). These changes will ultimately have effects 
      on socio-economic development paths. The development paths also have direct 
      effects on the natural systems (shown by the anti-clockwise arrow from the 
      development box) such as changes in land use leading to deforestation. This 
      figure illustrates that the various dimensions of the climate change issue 
      exist in a dynamic cycle, characterized by significant time delays. Both 
      emissions and impacts, for example, are linked in complex ways to underlying 
      socio-economic and technological development paths. A major contribution 
      of the TAR has been to explicitly consider the bottom righthand domain (shown 
      as a rectangle) by examining the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions 
      and development paths (in <a target="_blank" href="/climate/ipcc/emission/index.htm">SRES</a>), 
      and by assessing preliminary work on the linkage between adaptation, mitigation, 
      and development paths (<a href="../../wg2/index.htm">WGII</a> 
      and <a href="../../wg3/index.htm">WGIII</a>). However, the 
      TAR does not achieve a fully integrated assessment of climate change, since 
      not all components of the cycle were able to be linked dynamically. Adaptation 
      and mitigation are shown as modifying the effects shown in the figure.</td>
