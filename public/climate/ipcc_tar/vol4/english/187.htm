<h2><a name="72"></a>7.2 Analytical Approaches</h2>
<p>Cost assessment is an input into one or more rules for decision-making, including 
  cost-benefit analysis (CBA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), and multi-attribute 
  analysis. The analytical approaches differ primarily by how the objectives of 
  the decision-making framework are selected, specified, and valued. Some objectives 
  in mitigation policies can be specified in economic units (e.g., costs and benefits 
  measured in monetary units), and some in physical units (e.g., the amount of 
  pollutants dispersed in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>). In practice, however, the 
  challenge is in developing a consistent and comprehensive definition of every 
  important impact to be measured. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="721"></a>7.2.1 Co-Benefits and Costs and Ancillary Benefits and Costs 
</h3>
<p>The literature uses a number of terms to depict the associated benefits and 
  costs that arise in conjunction with GHG mitigation policies. These include 
  co-benefits, ancillary benefits, side benefits, secondary benefits, collateral 
  benefits, and associated benefits. In the current discussion, the term "co-benefits" 
  refers to the non-climate benefits of GHG mitigation policies that are explicitly 
  incorporated into the initial creation of mitigation policies. Thus, the term 
  co-benefits reflects that most policies designed to address GHG mitigation also 
  have other, often at least equally important, rationales involved at the inception 
  of these policies (e.g., related to objectives of development, sustainability, 
  and equity). In contrast, the term ancillary benefits connotes those secondary 
  or side effects of climate change mitigation policies on problems that arise 
  subsequent to any proposed GHG mitigation policies. </p>
<p>Policies aimed at mitigating GHGs, as stated earlier, can yield other social 
  benefits and costs (here called ancillary or co- benefits and costs), and a 
  number of empirical studies have made a preliminary attempt to assess these 
  impacts. It is apparent that the actual magnitude of the ancillary benefits 
  or co-benefits assessed critically depends on the scenario structure of the 
  analysis, in particular on the assumptions about policy management in the baseline 
  case. This implies that whether a particular impact is included or not depends 
  on the primary objective of the programme. Moreover, something that is seen 
  as a GHG reduction programme from an international perspective may be seen, 
  from a national perspective, as one in which local pollutants and GHGs are equally 
  important. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="722"></a>7.2.2 Implementation Costs</h3>
<p>All climate change policies necessitate some costs of implementation, that 
  is costs of changes to existing rules and regulations, making sure that the 
  necessary infrastructure is available, training and educating those who are 
  to implement the policy as well those affected by the measures, etc. Unfortunately, 
  such costs are not fully covered in conventional cost analyses. Implementation 
  costs in this context are meant to reflect the more permanent institutional 
  aspects of putting a programme into place and are different to those costs conventionally 
  considered as transaction costs. The latter, by definition, are temporary costs. 
  Considerable work needs to be done to quantify the institutional and other costs 
  of programmes, so that the reported figures are a better representation of the 
  true costs that will be incurred if programmes are actually implemented.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="723"></a>7.2.3 Discounting</h3>
<p>There are broadly two approaches to discounting-an ethical or prescriptive 
  approach based on what rates of discount should be applied, and a descriptive 
  approach based on what rates of discount people (savers as well as investors) 
  actually apply in their day-to-day decisions. For mitigation analysis, the country 
  must base its decisions at least partly on discount rates that reflect the opportunity 
  cost of capital. Rates that range from 4% to 6% would probably be justified 
  in developed countries. The rate could be 10-12% or even higher in developing 
  countries. It is more of a challenge to argue that climate change mitigation 
  projects should face different rates, unless the mitigation project is of very 
  long duration. The literature shows increasing attention to rates that decline 
  over time and hence give more weight to benefits that occur in the long term. 
  Note that these rates do not reflect private rates of return, which typically 
  must be greater to justify a project, at around 10-25%. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="724"></a>7.2.4 Adaptation and Mitigation Costs and the Link Between 
  Them</h3>
<p>While most people appreciate that adaptation choices affect the costs of mitigation, 
  this obvious point is often not addressed in climate policymaking. Policy is 
  fragmented - with mitigation being seen as addressing climate change and adaptation 
  seen as a means of reacting to natural hazards. Usually mitigation and adaptation 
  are modelled separately as a necessary simplification to gain traction on an 
  immense and complex issue. As a consequence, the costs of risk reduction action 
  are frequently estimated separately, and therefore each measure is potentially 
  biased. This realization suggests that more attention to the interaction of 
  mitigation and adaptation, and its empirical ramification, is worthwhile, though 
  uncertainty about the nature and timing of impacts, including surprises, will 
  constrain the extent to which the associated costs can be fully internalized.</p>
