              <p>For a variety of reasons, significant differences and uncertainties 
                surround specific quantitative estimates of mitigation costs. 
                Cost estimates differ because of the (a) methodology used in the 
                analysis, and (b) underlying factors and assumptions built into 
                the analysis. Bottom-up models incorporate detailed studies of 
                engineering costs of a wide range of available and anticipated 
                technologies, and describe energy consumption in great detail. 
                However, they typically incorporate relatively little detail on 
                non-energy consumer behavior and interactions with other sectors 
                of the economy. The costs estimated by bottom-up models can range 
                from negative values (due to the adoption of "no-regrets" 
                options) to positive values. Negative costs indicate that the 
                direct energy benefits of a mitigation option exceed its direct 
                costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs). Market 
                and institutional barriers, however, can prevent, delay, or make 
                more costly the adoption of these options. Inclusion of implementation 
                and policy costs would add to the costs estimated by bottom-up 
                models.</p>
              <p>Top-down models are aggregate models of the economy that often 
                draw on analysis of historical trends and relationships to predict 
                the large-scale interactions between sectors of the economy, especially 
                the interactions between the energy sector and the rest of the 
                economy. Top-down models typically incorporate relatively little 
                detail on energy consumption and technological change. The costs 
                estimated by top-down models usually range from zero to positive 
                values. This is because negative cost options estimated in bottom-up 
                models are assumed to be adopted in both the baseline and policy 
                scenarios. This is an important factor in the differences in the 
                estimates from these two types of models.</p>
              <p>The inclusion of some factors will lead to lower cost estimates 
                and others to higher estimates. Incorporating multiple greenhouse 
                gases, sinks, induced technical change, and emissions trading 
                can lower costs. Further, studies suggest that some sources of 
                greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at no or negative net 
                social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no-regret 
                opportunities such as correcting market imperfections, inclusion 
                of ancillary benefits, and efficient tax revenue recycling. International 
                cooperation that facilitates cost-effective emissions reductions 
                can lower mitigation costs. On the other hand, accounting for 
                potential short-term macro shocks to the economy, constraints 
                on the use of domestic and international market mechanisms, high 
                transaction costs, inclusion of ancillary costs, and ineffective 
                tax recycling measures can increase estimated costs. Since no 
                analysis incorporates all relevant factors affecting mitigation 
                costs, estimated costs may not reflect the actual costs of implementing 
                mitigation actions. <br>
