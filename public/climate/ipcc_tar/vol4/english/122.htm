<h2>4. Vulnerability Varies across Regions</h2>
<p>The vulnerability of human populations and natural systems to climate change 
  differs substantially across regions and across populations within regions. 
  Regional differences in baseline climate and expected climate change give rise 
  to different exposures to climate stimuli across regions. The natural and social 
  systems of different regions have varied characteristics, resources, and institutions, 
  and are subject to varied pressures that give rise to differences in sensitivity 
  and adaptive capacity. From these differences emerge different key concerns 
  for each of the major regions of the world. Even within regions however, impacts, 
  adaptive capacity, and vulnerability will vary. [<a href="141.htm">5</a>]</p>
<p>In light of the above, all regions are likely to experience some adverse effects 
  of climate change. <a href="120.htm#tabspm2">Table SPM-2</a> presents in a highly 
  summarized fashion some of the key concerns for the different regions. Some 
  regions are particularly vulnerable because of their physical exposure to climate 
  change hazards and/or their limited adaptive capacity. Most less-developed regions 
  are especially vulnerable because a larger share of their economies are in climate-sensitive 
  sectors and their adaptive capacity is low due to low levels of human, financial, 
  and natural resources, as well as limited institutional and technological capability. 
  For example, small island states and low-lying coastal areas are particularly 
  vulnerable to increases in sea level and storms, and most of them have limited 
  capabilities for adaptation. Climate change impacts in polar regions are expected 
  to be large and rapid, including reduction in sea-ice extent and thickness and 
  degradation of permafrost. Adverse changes in seasonal river flows, floods and 
  droughts, food security, fisheries, health effects, and loss of biodiversity 
  are among the major regional vulnerabilities and concerns of Africa, Latin America, 
  and Asia where adaptation opportunities are generally low. Even in regions with 
  higher adaptive capacity, such as North America and Australia and New Zealand, 
  there are vulnerable communities, such as indigenous peoples, and the possibility 
  of adaptation of ecosystems is very limited. In Europe, vulnerability is significantly 
  greater in the south and in the Arctic than elsewhere in the region. [<a href="141.htm">5</a>]</p>
