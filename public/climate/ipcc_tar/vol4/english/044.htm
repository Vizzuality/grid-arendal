      <strong><a name="figspm55"></a>Figure 5-5: The recent net 
      uptake of carbon on the land is partly due to enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
      through plant growth, with a delay before this carbon is returned to the 
      atmosphere via the decay of plant material and soil organic matter.</strong> 
      Several processes contribute to the enhanced plant growth: changes in land 
      use and management, fertilizing effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen, 
      and some climate changes (such as a longer growing season at high latitudes). 
      A range of models (identified by their acronyms in the figure) project a 
      continued increase in the strength of the net carbon uptake on land for 
      several decades, then a leveling off or decline late in the 21st century 
      for reasons explained in the text. The model results illustrated here arise 
      from the IS92a scenario, but similar conclusions are reached using other 
      scenarios.</td>

      withsociety'sphysicalinfrastructure, institutions, and the technologies

      This is obvious, for instance, in relation to the impact of urban design 
      and infrastructure on energy consumption for heating, cooling, and transport. 
      Markets sometimes "lock in" to technologies and practices that 
      are sub-optimal because of the investment in supporting infrastructure, 
      which block out alternatives. Diffusion of many innovations comes up against 
      people's traditional preferences and other social and cultural barriers.
      Unless advantages are very clear, social or behavioral changes on the part
      of technology users may require decades. Energy use and greenhouse gas
      mitigation
      are peripheral interests
      in most people's everyday lives. Their consumption patterns are driven 
      not only by demographic, economic and technological change, resource availability, 
      infrastructure, and time constraints, but also by motivation, habit, need, 
      compulsion, social structures, and other factors. <br>

      fixed: They are sensitive to social and economic forces, and could be changed 
      by policies and the choices made by individuals.</span> Behavioral and technological 
      changes can occur rapidly under severe economic conditions. For example, 
      the oil crises of the 1970s triggered societal interest in energy conservation 
      and alternative sources of energy, and the economy in most Organisation 
      for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries deviated strongly 
      from the traditional tie between energy consumption and economic development 
      growth rates (see <a href="044.htm#figspm56">Figure 5-6</a>). Another example 
      is the observed reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by the disruption 
      of the economy of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries in 1988. The response 
      in both case was very rapid (within a few years). The converse is also apparently 
      true: In situations where pressure to change is small, inertia is large. 
      This has implicitly been assumed to be the case in the SRES scenarios, since 
      they do not consider major stresses, such as economic recession, large-scale 
      conflict, or collapses in food stocks and associated human suffering, which 
      are inherently difficult to forecast.<br>

      concentration at levels below about 600 ppm is only possible with reductions 
      in carbon intensity and/or energy intensity greater than have been achieved 
      historically. </span>This implies shifts toward alternative development 
      pathways with new social, institutional, and technological configurations 
      that address environmental constraints. Low historical rates of improvement 
      in energy intensity (energy use per unit GDP) reflect the relatively low 
      priority placed on energy efficiency by most producers and users of technology. 
      By contrast, labor productivity increased at higher rates over the period 
      1980 to 1992. The historically recorded annual rates of mprovement of global 
      energy intensity (1 to 1.5% per year) would have to be increased and maintained 
      over long time frames to achieve stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
      at about 600 ppm or below (see <a href="045.htm#figspm57">Figure 5-7</a>). 
      Carbon intensity (carbon per unit energy produced) reduction rates would 
      eventually have to change by even more (e.g., up to 1.5% per year (the historical 
      baseline is 0.3 to 0.4% per year)). In reality, both energy intensity and 
      carbon intensity are likely to continue to improve, but greenhouse gas stabilization 
      at levels below 600 ppm requires that at least one of them do so at a rate 
      much higher than historically achieved. The lower the stabilization target 
      and the higher the level of baseline emissions, the larger the CO<sub>2</sub> 
      divergence from the baseline that is needed, and the earlier it would need 
      to occur.<br>

      </span>"Effective irreversibility" derives from processes that 
      have the potential to return to their pre-disturbance state, but take centuries 
      to millennia to do so. An example is the partial melting of the Greenland 
      ice sheet. Another is the projected rise in mean sea level, partly as a 
      result of melting of the cryosphere, but primarily due to thermal expansion 
      of the oceans. The world is already committed to some sea-level rise as 
      a consequence of the surface atmospheric warming that has occurred over 
      the past century. "Intrinsic irreversibility" results from crossing 
      a threshold beyond which the system no longer spontaneously returns to the 
      previous state. An example of an intrinsically irreversible change due to 
      crossing a threshold is the extinction of species, resulting from a combination 
      of climate change and habitat loss. </td>
