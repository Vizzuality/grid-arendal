<h2>B.5 Observed Changes in Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation Patterns</h2>
<i>The behaviour of ENSO (see <a href="092.htm#box4">Box 4</a> for a general description), 
has been unusual since the mid-1970s compared with the previous 100 years, with 
warm phase ENSO episodes being relatively more frequent, persistent, and intense 
than the opposite cool phase.</i> This recent behaviour of ENSO is reflected in 
variations in precipitation and temperature over much of the global tropics and 
sub-tropics. The overall effect is likely to have been a small contribution to 
the increase in global temperatures during the last few decades. The Inter-decadal 
Pacific Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are associated with decadal 
to multidecadal climate variability over the Pacific basin. It is likely that 
these oscillations modulate ENSO-related climate variability.<br>
<p><i>Other important circulation features that affect the climate in large regions 
  of the globe are being characterised.</i> The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 
  is linked to the strength of the westerlies over the Atlantic and extra-tropical 
  Eurasia. During winter the NAO displays irregular oscillations on interannual 
  to multi-decadal time-scales. Since the 1970s, the winter NAO has often been 
  in a phase that contributes to stronger westerlies, which correlate with cold 
  season warming over Eurasia. New evidence indicates that the NAO and changes 
  in Arctic sea ice are likely to be closely coupled. The NAO is now believed 
  to be part of a wider scale atmospheric Arctic Oscillation that affects much 
  of the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. A similar Antarctic Oscillation has 
  been in an enhanced positive phase during the last 15 years, with stronger westerlies 
  over the Southern Oceans.</p>

<h2>B.6 Observed Changes in Climate Variability and Extreme Weather and Climate 
  Events</h2>
<i>New analyses show that in regions where total precipitation has increased, 
it is very likely that there have been even more pronounced increases in heavy 
and extreme precipitation events. The converse is also true.</i> In some regions, 
however, heavy and extreme events (i.e., defined to be within the upper or lower 
ten percentiles) have increased despite the fact that total precipitation has 
decreased or remained constant. This is attributed to a decrease in the frequency 
of precipitation events. Overall, it is likely that for many mid- and high latitude 
areas, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, statistically significant increases 
have occurred in the proportion of total annual precipitation derived from heavy 
and extreme precipitation events; it is likely that there has been a 2 to 4% increase 
in the frequency of heavy precipitation events over the latter half of the 20th 
century. Over the 20th century (1900 to 1995), there were relatively small increases 
in global land areas experiencing severe drought or severe wetness. In some regions, 
such as parts of Asia and Africa, the frequency and intensity of drought have 
been observed to increase in recent decades. In many regions, these changes are 
dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal climate variability, such as the 
shift in ENSO towards more warm events. In many regions, inter-daily temperature 
variability has decreased, and increases in the daily minimum temperature are 
lengthening the freeze-free period in most mid- and high latitude regions. Since 
1950 it is very likely that there has been a significant reduction in the frequency 
of much-below-normal seasonal mean temperatures across much of the globe, but 
there has been a smaller increase in the frequency of much-above-normal seasonal 
temperatures.<br>
<p><i>There is no compelling evidence to indicate that the characteristics of 
  tropical and extratropical storms have changed.</i> Changes in tropical storm 
  intensity and frequency are dominated by interdecadal to multidecadal variations, 
  which may be substantial, e.g., in the tropical North Atlantic. Owing to incomplete 
  data and limited and conflicting analyses, it is uncertain as to whether there 
  have been any long-term and large-scale increases in the intensity and frequency 
  of extra-tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere. Regional increases have 
  been identified in the North Pacific, parts of North America, and Europe over 
  the past several decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, fewer analyses have been 
  completed, but they suggest a decrease in extra-tropical cyclone activity since 
  the 1970s. Recent analyses of changes in severe local weather (e.g., tornadoes, 
  thunderstorm days, and hail) in a few selected regions do not provide compelling 
  evidence to suggest long-term changes. In general, trends in severe weather 
  events are notoriously difficult to detect because of their relatively rare 
  occurrence and large spatial variability.</p>

<h2>B.7 The Collective Picture: A Warming World and Other Changes in the Climate 
  System</h2>
<p>As summarised above, a suite of climate changes is now well-documented, particularly 
  over the recent decades to century time period, with its growing set of direct 
  measurements. <a href="#figTechSum7">Figure 7</a> illustrates these trends in 
  temperature indicators (<a href="#figTechSum7a">Figure 7a</a>) and hydrological 
  and storm-related indicators (<a href="#figTechSum7b">Figure 7b</a>), as well 
  as also providing an indication of certainty about the changes.</p>

<h3><b>Taken together, these trends illustrate a collective picture of a warming 
  world:</b> </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Surface temperature measurements over the land and oceans (with two separate 
    estimates over the latter) have been measured and adjusted independently. 
    All data sets show quite similar upward trends globally, with two major warming 
    periods globally: 1910 to 1945 and since 1976. There is an emerging tendency 
    for global land-surface air temperatures to warm faster than the global ocean-surface 
    temperatures. 
  <li>Weather balloon measurements show that lower-tropospheric temperatures have 
    been increasing since 1958, though only slightly since 1979. Since 1979, satellite 
    data are available and show similar trends to balloon data. 
  <li>The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range coincides with 
    increases in cloud amount, precipitation, and increases in total water vapour. 
  <li>The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent and ice mass is 
    consistent with worldwide surface temperature increases. A few recent exceptions 
    in coastal regions are consistent with atmospheric circulation variations 
    and related precipitation increases. 
  <li>The decreases in snow cover and the shortening seasons of lake and river 
    ice relate well to increases in Northern Hemispheric land-surface temperatures. 
  <li>The systematic decrease in spring and summer sea-ice extent and thickness 
    in the Arctic is consistent with increases in temperature over most of the 
    adjacent land and ocean. 
  <li>Ocean heat content has increased, and global average sea level has risen. 
  <li>The increases in total tropospheric water vapour in the last 25 years are 
    qualitatively consistent with increases in tropospheric temperatures and an 
    enhanced hydrologic cycle, resulting in more extreme and heavier precipitation 
    events in many areas with increasing precipitation, e.g., middle and high 
    latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. 
</ul>
<a name="aspects"></a> 
<h3><b>Some important aspects of climate appear not to have changed.</b> </h3>
<ul>
  <li>A few areas of the globe have not warmed in recent decades, mainly over 
    some parts of the Southern Hemisphere oceans and parts of Antarctica. 
  <li>No significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice extent are apparent over the 
    period of systematic satellite measurements (since 1978). 
  <li>Based on limited data, the observed variations in the intensity and frequency 
    of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and severe local storms show no clear 
    trends in the last half of the 20th century, although multi-decadal fluctuations 
    are sometimes apparent. 
</ul>
The variations and trends in the examined indicators imply that it is virtually 
certain that there has been a generally increasing trend in global surface temperature 
over the 20th century, although short-term and regional deviations from this trend 
occur.<br>
