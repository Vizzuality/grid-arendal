<h1>11 Gaps in Knowledge</h1>
<p>Important gaps in own knowledge on which additional research could be useful 
  to support future assessments include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Further exploration of the regional, country, and sector specific potentials 
    of technological and social innovation options, including: </i><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The short, medium, and long-term potential and costs of both CO<sub>2</sub> 
        and non-CO<sub>2</sub>, non-energy mitigation options;</li>
      <li>Understanding of technology diffusion across different regions;</li>
      <li>Identifying opportunities in the area of social innovation leading to 
        decreased greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
      <li>Comprehensive analysis of the impact of mitigation measures on C flows 
        in and out of the terrestrial system; and </li>
      <li>Some basic inquiry in the area of geo-engineering.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Economic, social, and institutional issues related to climate change 
    mitigation in all countries. Priority areas include: </i><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Much more analysis of regionally specific mitigation options, barriers, 
        and policies is recommended as these are conditioned by the regions' 
        mitigative capacity;</li>
      <li>The implications of mitigation on equity;</li>
      <li>Appropriate methodologies and improved data sources for climate change 
        mitigation and capacity building in the area of integrated assessment;</li>
      <li>Strengthening future research and assessments, especially in developing 
        countries. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Methodologies for analysis of the potential of mitigation options and 
    their cost, with special attention to comparability of results. Examples include: 
    </i><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Characterizing and measuring barriers that inhibit greenhouse gas-reducing 
        action;</li>
      <li>Make mitigation modelling techniques more consistent, reproducible, 
        and accessible;</li>
      <li>Modelling technology learning; improving analytical tools for evaluating 
        ancillary benefits, e.g. assigning the costs of abatement to greenhouse 
        gases and to other pollutants;</li>
      <li>Systematically analyzing the dependency of costs on baseline assumptions 
        for various greenhouse gas stabilization scenarios;</li>
      <li>Developing decision analytical frameworks for dealing with uncertainty 
        as well as socio-economic and ecological risk in climate policymaking; 
      </li>
      <li>Improving global models and studies, their assumptions, and their consistency 
        in the treatment and reporting of non-Annex I countries and regions.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Evaluating climate mitigation options in the context of development, 
    sustainability, and equity. Examples include: </i><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>More research is needed on the balance of options in the areas of mitigation 
        and adaptation and of the mitigative and adaptive capacity in the context 
        of DES;</li>
      <li>Exploration of alternative development paths including sustainable consumption 
        patterns in all sectors, including the transportation sector, and integrated 
        analysis of mitigation and adaptation; </li>
      <li>Identifying opportunities for synergy between explicit climate policies 
        and general policies promoting sustainable development;</li>
      <li>Integration of inter- and intragenerational equity in climate change 
        mitigation studies;</li>
      <li>Implications of equity assessments; </li>
      <li>Analysis of scientific, technical, and economic aspects of implications 
        of options under a wide variety of stabilization regimes;</li>
      <li>Determining what kinds of policies interact with what sorts of socio-economic 
        conditions to result in futures characterized by low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions;</li>
      <li>Investigation on how changes in societal values may be encouraged to 
        promote sustainable development; and</li>
      <li>Evaluating climate mitigation options in the context of and for synergy 
        with potential or actual adaptive measures.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Development of engineering-economic, end-use, and sectoral studies of 
    GHG emissions mitigation potentials for specific regions and/or countries 
    of the world, focusing on: <br>
    </i><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification and assessment of mitigation technologies and measures 
        that are required to deviate from "business-as-usual" in the 
        short term (2010, 2020);</li>
      <li>Development of standardized methodologies for quantifying emissions 
        reductions and costs of mitigation technologies and measures;</li>
      <li>Identification of barriers to the implementation of the mitigation technologies 
        and measures;</li>
      <li>Identification of opportunities to increase adoption of GHG emissions 
        mitigation technologies and measures through connections with ancillary 
        benefits as well as furtherance of the DES goals; and</li>
      <li>Linking the results of the assessments to specific policies and programmes 
        that can overcome the identified barriers as well as leverage the identified 
        ancillary benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
