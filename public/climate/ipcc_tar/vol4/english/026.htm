      <p>The greenhouse gas emissions scenarios used as the basis for the climate 
        projections in the TAR are those contained in the IPCC Special Report 
        on Emissions Scenarios (see Box 3-1). Because the SRES scenarios had only 
        been available for a very short time prior to production of the TAR, it 
        was not possible to include impact assessments based on these scenarios. 
        Hence, the impacts assessments in the TAR use climate model results that 
        tend to be based on equilibrium climate change scenarios (e.g., 2xCO<sub>2</sub>), 
        a relatively small number of experiments using a 1% per year CO<sub>2</sub> 
        increase transient scenario, or the scenarios used in the Second Assessment 
        Report (i.e., the IS92 series). The challenge in answering this question 
        therefore is to try and map these impact results onto the climate change 
        results, which have used the <a target="_blank" href="/climate/ipcc/emission/index.htm">SRES</a> 
        scenarios. This, by necessity, requires various approximations to be made 
        and in many cases only qualitative conclusions can be drawn. Projections 
        of changes in climate variability, extreme events, and abrupt/non-linear 
        changes are covered in <a href="037.htm">Question 4</a>.<br>

          <td bgcolor="#B9CFE3">Changes in climate occur as a result of internal 
            variability of the climate system and external factors (both natural 
            and as a result of human activities). Emissions of greenhouse gases 
            and aerosols due to human activities change the composition of the 
            atmosphere. Future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols are 
            determined by driving forces such as population, socio-economic development, 
            and technological change, and hence are highly uncertain. Scenarios 
            are alternative images of how the future might unfold and are an appropriate 
            tool with which to analyze how driving forces may influence future 
            emission outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties. The 
            SRES scenarios, developed to update the IS92 series, consist of six 
            scenario groups, based on narrative storylines, which span a wide 
            range of these driving forces (see <a href="027.htm#figspm31">Figure 
            3-1</a>). They are all plausible and internally consistent, and no 
            probabilities of occurrence are assigned. They encompass four combinations 
            of demographic change, social and economic development, and broad 
            technological developments (A1B, A2, B1, B2). Two further scenario 
            groups, A1FI and A1T, explicitly explore alternative energy technology 
            developments to A1B (see <a href="027.htm#figspm31">Figure 
            3-1a</a>). The resulting emissions of the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub>, 
            CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O, along with SO<sub>2</sub> which 
            leads to the production of sulfate aerosols, are shown in Figures 
            3-1b to 3-1e; other gases and particles are also important. These 
            emissions cause changes in the concentrations of these gases and aerosols 
            in the atmosphere. The changes in the concentrations for the SRES 
            scenarios are shown in Figures 3-1f to 3-1i. Note that for gases which 
            stay in the atmosphere for a long period, such as CO<sub>2</sub> shown 
            in panel (f), the atmospheric concentration responds to changes in 
            emissions relatively slowly (e.g., see <a href="043.htm#figspm53">Figure 
            5-3</a>); whereas for short-lived gases and aerosols, such as sulfate 
            aerosols shown in panel (i), the atmospheric concentration responds 
            much more quickly. The influence of changes in the concentrations 
            of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere on the climate 
            system can broadly be compared using the concept of radiative forcing, 
            which is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance 
            of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system. A 
            positive radiative forcing, such as that produced by increasing concentrations 
            of greenhouse gases, tends to warm the surface; conversely a negative 
            radiative forcing, which can arise from an increase in some types 
            of aerosols such as sulfate aerosols, tends to cool the surface. The 
            radiative forcing resulting from the increasing concentrations in 
            panels (f) to (i) is shown in panel (j). Note that, as with the IS92 
            scenarios, all combinations of emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols 
            in the SRES scenarios result in increased radiative forcing. </td>
