      The recent global net uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by terrestrial ecosystems 
      is partly the result of time lags between enhanced plant growth and plant 
      death and decay. Current enhanced plant growth is partly due to fertilization 
      effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen deposition, and changes 
      in climate and land-use practices. The uptake will decline as forests reach 
      maturity, fertilization effects saturate, and decomposition catches up with 
      growth. Climate change is likely to further reduce net terrestrial carbon 
      uptake globally. Although warming reduces the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by 
      the ocean, the oceanic carbon sink is projected to persist under rising 
      atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, at least for the 21st century. Movement of carbon 
      from the surface to the deep ocean takes centuries, and its equilibration 
      there with ocean sediments takes millennia.</td>

      The combined system generally evolves relatively slowly. It can respond

      costs due to technological advancement or because capital equipment value

      perceiving a need to respond to a major challenge, planning, researching
