      and other climate variables and phenomena, the impacts of climate change 
      cannot be uniquely determined for individual emission scenarios. There are 
      also uncertainties about key processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities 
      of systems to changes in climate. In addition, impacts such as the changes 
      in the composition and function of ecological systems, species extinction, 
      and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution of impacts 
      across different populations, are not readily expressed in monetary or other 
      common units. Because of these limitations, the benefits of different greenhouse 
      gas emission reduction actions, including actions to stabilize greenhouse 
      gas concentrations at selected levels, are incompletely characterized and 
      cannot be compared directly to mitigation costs for the purpose of estimating 
      the net economic effects of mitigation.</td>

      </font>Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, even stabilization of their 
      concentrations in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether 
      prevent climate change or sea-level rise nor altogether prevent their impacts. 
      Many reactive adaptations will occur in response to the changing climate 
      and rising seas and some have already occurred. In addition, the development 
      of planned adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize opportunities 
      can complement mitigation actions to lessen climate change impacts. However, 
      adaptation would entail costs and cannot prevent all damages. The costs 
      of adaptation can be lessened by mitigation actions that will reduce and 
      slow the climate changes to which systems would otherwise be exposed.</td>
