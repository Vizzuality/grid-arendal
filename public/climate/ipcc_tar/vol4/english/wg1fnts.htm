<p><b><sup><a name="1"></a>1</sup></b> Climate change in IPCC usage refers to 
  any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a 
  result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is 
  attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition 
  of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability 
  observed over comparable time periods. For a definition of scientific and technical 
  terms: see the Glossary in Appendix I.</p>
<p><b><a name="2"></a><sup>2</sup></b> The IPCC Second Assessment Report is referred 
  to in this Technical Summary as the SAR.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup></b> Generally, temperature trends are rounded 
  to the nearest 0.05&deg;C per unit of time, the periods often being limited 
  by data availability.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup></b> In this Technical Summary and in the Summary 
  for Policymakers, the following words have been used to indicate approximate 
  judgmental estimates of confidence: virtually certain (greater than 99% chance 
  that a result is true); very likely (90-99% chance); likely (66-90% chance); 
  medium likelihood (33-66% chance); unlikely (10-33% chance); very unlikely (1-10% 
  chance); exceptionally unlikely (less than 1% chance). The reader is referred 
  to individual chapters for more details.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup></b> Atmospheric abundances of trace gases are 
  reported here as the mole fraction (molar mixing ratio) of the gas relative 
  to dry air (ppm = 10<sup>-6</sup>, ppb = 10<sup>-9</sup>, ppt = 10<sup>-12</sup>). 
  Atmospheric burden is reported as the total mass of the gas (e.g., Mt = Tg = 
  10<sup>12</sup> g). The global carbon cycle is expressed in PgC = GtC.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup></b> Complex physically based climate models 
  are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to explore 
  the range of scenarios, these are complemented by simple climate models calibrated 
  to yield an equivalent response in temperature and sea level to complex climate 
  models. These projections are obtained using a simple climate model whose climate 
  sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of 7 complex climate 
  models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 
  4.2&deg;C, which is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup></b> This range does not include uncertainties 
  in the modelling of radiative forcing, e.g. aerosol forcing uncertainties. A 
  small carbon cycle climate feedback is included.</p>
<p><b><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup></b> Heat index: A combination of temperature 
  and humidity that measures effects on human comfort</p>
