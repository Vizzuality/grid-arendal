        change is defined as one that holds under a variety of approaches, methods, 
        models, and assumptions and one that is expected to be relatively unaffected 
        by uncertainties. <i><b>Key uncertainties</b></i> in this context are 
        those that, if reduced, may lead to new and robust findings in relation 
        to the questions of this report. In the examples in <a href="015.htm#tabspm3">Table 
        SPM-3</a>, many of the robust findings relate to the <em>existence </em>of 
        a climate response to human activities and the sign of the response. Many 
        of the key uncertainties are concerned with the <em>quantification </em>of 
        the magnitude and/or timing of the response. After addressing the attribution 
        of climate change, the table deals in order with the issues illustrated 
        in <a href="007.htm#figspm1">Figure SPM-1</a>. <a href="015.htm#figspm10a">Figure

        <li> The understanding and prediction of regional changes in climate and 
          climate extremes</li>
        <li> The quantification of climate change impacts at the global, regional, 
          and local levels</li>
        <li> The analysis of adaptation and mitigation activities</li>
        <li> The integration of all aspects of the climate change issue into strategies

			<p><strong>Figure SPM-10b: Variations 
              of the Earth's surface temperature: years 1000 to 2100.</strong> 
              From year 1000 to year 1860 variations in average surface temperature 
              of the Northern Hemisphere are shown (corresponding data from the 
              Southern Hemisphere not available) reconstructed from proxy data 
              (tree rings, corals, ice cores, and historical records). The line 
              shows the 50-year average, the grey region the 95% confidence limit 
              in the annual data. From years 1860 to 2000 are shown variations 
              in observations of globally and annually averaged surface temperature 
              from the instrumental record; the line shows the decadal average. 
              From years 2000 to 2100 projections of globally averaged surface 
              temperature are shown for the six illustrative SRES scenarios and 
              IS92a using a model with average climate sensitivity. The grey region 
              marked "several models all SRES envelope" shows the range of results 
              from the full range of 35 SRES scenarios in addition to those from 
              a range of models with different climate sensitivities. The temperature 
              scale is departure from the 1990 value; the scale is different from 
              that used in <a href="008.htm#figspm2">Figure SPM-2</a>.</p>
