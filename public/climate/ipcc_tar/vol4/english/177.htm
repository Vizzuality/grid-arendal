<h2><a name="34"></a>3.4 The Technological and Economic Potential of Greenhouse 
  Gas Mitigation: Synthesis</h2>
<p>Global emissions of GHGs grew on average by 1.4% per year during the period 
  1990 to 1998. In many areas, technical progress relevant to GHG emission reduction 
  since the SAR has been significant and faster than anticipated. The total potential 
  for worldwide GHG emissions reductions resulting from technological developments 
  and their adoption amount to 1,900 to 2,600MtC/yr by 2010, and 3,600 to 5,050MtC/yr 
  by 2020. The evidence on which this conclusion is based is extensive, but has 
  several limitations. No comprehensive worldwide study of technological potential 
  has yet been done, and the existing regional and national studies generally 
  have varying scopes and make different assumptions about key parameters. Therefore, 
  the estimates as presented in <a href="173.htm#tabts1">Table TS.1</a> should 
  be considered to be indicative only. Nevertheless, the main conclusion in the 
  paragraph above can be drawn with high confidence.</p>
<p>Costs of options vary by technology and show regional differences. Half of 
  the potential emissions reductions may be achieved by 2020 with direct benefits 
  (energy saved) exceeding direct costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance 
  costs), and the other half at a net direct cost of up to US$100/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  (at 1998 prices). These cost estimates are derived using discount rates in the 
  range of 5% to 12%, consistent with public sector discount rates. Private internal 
  rates of return vary greatly, and are often significantly higher, which affects 
  the rate of adoption of these technologies by private entities. Depending on 
  the emissions scenario this could allow global emissions to be reduced below 
  2000 levels in 2010-2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing these reductions 
  will involve additional implementation costs, which in some cases may be substantial, 
  and will possibly need supporting policies (such as those described in <a href="183.htm">Section 
  6</a>), increased research and development, effective technology transfer, and 
  other barriers to be overcome (<a href="180.htm">Section 5</a> 
  for details).</p>
<p>Hundreds of technologies and practices exist to reduce GHG emissions from the 
  buildings, transport, and industry sectors. These energy efficiency options 
  are responsible for more than half of the total emission reduction potential 
  of these sectors. Efficiency improvements in material use (including recycling) 
  will also become more important in the longer term. The energy supply and conversion 
  sector will remain dominated by cheap and abundant fossil fuels. However, there 
  is significant emission reduction potential thanks to a shift from coal to natural 
  gas, conversion efficiency improvement of power plants, the expansion of distributed 
  co-generation plants in industry, commercial buildings and institutions, and 
  CO<sub>2</sub> recovery and sequestration. The continued use of nuclear power 
  plants (including their lifetime extension), and the application of renewable 
  energy sources could avoid some additional emissions from fossil fuel use. Biomass 
  from by-products and wastes such as landfill gas are potentially important energy 
  sources that can be supplemented by energy crop production where suitable land 
  and water are available. Wind energy and hydropower will also contribute, more 
  so than solar energy because of its relatively high costs. N<sub>2</sub>O and 
  fluorinated GHG reductions have already been achieved through major technological 
  advances. Process changes, improved containment and recovery, and the use of 
  alternative compounds and technologies have been implemented. Potential for 
  future reductions exists, including process-related emissions from insulated 
  foam and semiconductor production and by-product emissions from aluminium and 
  HCFC-22. The potential for energy efficiency improvements connected to the use 
  of fluorinated gases is of a similar magnitude to reductions of direct emissions. 
  Soil carbon sequestration, enteric CH<sub>4</sub> control, and conservation 
  tillage can all contribute to mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture. </p>
<p>Appropriate policies are required to realize these potentials. Furthermore, 
  on-going research and development is expected to significantly widen the portfolio 
  of technologies that provide emission reduction options. Maintaining these R&amp;D 
  activities together with technology transfer actions will be necessary if the 
  longer term potential as outlined in <a href="173.htm#tabts1">Table TS.1</a> 
  is to be realized. Balancing mitigation activities in the various sectors with 
  other goals, such as those related to DES, is key to ensuring they are effective.</p>
