      processes and cycles resulting from the interplay among the environment's 
      components involved, as affected by human action.</b> The scheme shows some 
      of these issues. For simplicity, the single double-ended arrows between 
      issues represent some of the linkages involved. For example, biological 
      and ecological processes play an important role in modulating the Earth's 
      climate at both regional and global scale by controlling the amounts of 
      water vapor and other greenhouse gases that enter into or are depleted from 
      the atmosphere. Changes in climate affect the boundaries, composition, and 
      functioning of ecological systems, such as forests, and changes in the structure 
      and functioning of forests affect the Earth's climate system through 
      changes in the biogeochemical cycles, particularly cycles of carbon, nitrogen, 
      and water. There are other linkages such as the connection between air quality 
      and forestry, directly or through acid precipitation, which for simplicity 
      are not shown here.</td>

        Projections based on some SRES scenarios show increases in tropospheric 
        ozone of more than 40 ppb over most of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. 
        Such increases would approximately double the baseline levels of ozone 
        entering many metropolitan regions, substantially degrading air quality. 
        Climate change would affect the meteorological conditions (regional temperature, 
        cloud cover, and surface wind) that influence photochemistry, and the 
        occurrence of major pollution episodes. While warmer temperatures would 
        generally contribute to more urban ozone, the change in frequency and 
        intensity of pollution episodes has not been evaluated. Adverse health 
        effects attributable to urban air quality would be exacerbated by increases 
        in heat waves that would accompany anthropogenic climate change.<br>

        terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and causes damage to human health and 
        many materials. Some of these impacts could be exacerbated by climate 
        change (e.g., through increase in humidity and temperature). Actions to 
        reduce sulfur emissions have been taken in many countries, and declines 
        in sulfate deposition have been observed in some regions in recent years 
        (see <a href="066.htm#tbl8-3">Table 8-3</a>). In the SRES scenarios, this 
        situation has led to projections of future sulfate aerosol abundances 
        that are lower than those in the SAR. This has led, in turn, to less negative 
        projections for the radiative forcing by aerosols, hence less of a cooling 
        effect to offset the greenhouse gas-induced warming.<br>

      penetration of UV-B radiation, with harmful effects on human and animal 
      health, plants, etc. During the last 2 decades, the observed losses of stratospheric 
      ozone have decreased the downward infrared emissions to the troposphere 
      from the (now colder) lower stratosphere. Stratospheric ozone depletion 
      has also altered tropospheric ozone concentrations, and, by allowing more 
      ultraviolet sunlight into the troposphere, it has led to more rapid photochemical 
      destruction of CH<sub>4</sub> thereby reducing its radiative forcing. These 
      effects lead also to a cooling of the climate system.<br> <br> </td>

      stratospheric ozone depletion (noted above) reduces this by about half.<br>
      The Montreal Protocol will eventually eliminate both of these radiative-forcing 
      contributions. However, one class of substitutes for the now-banned chlorofluorocarbons 
      is hydrofluorocarbons, which are among the greenhouse gases listed under 
      the Kyoto Protocol. This overlap can give rise to a potential conflict beween 
      the goals of the two Protocols.<br> <br> </td>

      change will result in significant increases in the depletion of the Arctic 
      stratospheric ozone layer over the next decade before chlorofluorocarbon 
      concentrations have declined substantially. Although many climate/ozone-layer
