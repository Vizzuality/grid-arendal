<h1><a name="12"></a>1.2 Broadening the Context of Climate Change Mitigation</h1>
<p>This chapter places climate change mitigation, mitigation policy, and the contents 
  of the rest of the report in the broader context of development, equity, and 
  sustainability. This context reflects the explicit conditions and principles 
  laid down by the UNFCCC on the pursuit of the ultimate objective of stabilizing 
  greenhouse gas concentrations. The UNFCCC imposes three conditions on the goal 
  of stabilization: namely that it should take place within a time-frame sufficient 
  to "allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that 
  food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed 
  in a sustainable manner" (Art. 2). It also specifies several principles 
  to guide this process: equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, precaution, 
  cost-effective measures, right to sustainable development, and support for an 
  open international economic system (Art. 3). </p>
<p>Previous IPCC assessment reports sought to facilitate this pursuit by comprehensively 
  describing, cataloguing, and comparing technologies and policy instruments that 
  could be used to achieve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective 
  and efficient manner. The present assessment advances this process by including 
  recent analyses of climate change that place policy evaluations in the context 
  of sustainable development. This expansion of scope is consistent both with 
  the evolution of the literature on climate change and the importance accorded 
  by the UNFCCC to sustainable development - including the recognition that "Parties 
  have a right to, and should promote sustainable development" (Art. 3.4). 
  It therefore goes some way towards filling the gaps in earlier assessments.</p>
<p>Climate change involves complex interactions between climatic, environmental, 
  economic, political, institutional, social, and technological processes. It 
  cannot be addressed or comprehended in isolation of broader societal goals (such 
  as equity or sustainable development), or other existing or probable future 
  sources of stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplicity of approaches 
  have emerged to analyze climate change and related challenges. Many of these 
  incorporate concerns about development, equity, and sustainability (DES) (albeit 
  partially and gradually) into their framework and recommendations. Each approach 
  emphasizes certain elements of the problem, and focuses on certain classes of 
  responses, including for example, optimal policy design, building capacity for 
  designing and implementing policies, strengthening synergies between climate 
  change mitigation and/or adaptation and other societal goals, and policies to 
  enhance societal learning. These approaches are therefore complementary rather 
  than mutually exclusive. </p>
<p>This chapter brings together three broad classes of analysis, which differ 
  not so much in terms of their ultimate goals as of their points of departure 
  and preferred analytical tools. The three approaches start with concerns, respectively, 
  about efficiency and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable development, 
  and global sustainability and societal learning. The difference between the 
  three approaches selected lies in their starting point not in their ultimate 
  goals. Regardless of the starting point of the analysis, many studies try in 
  their own way to incorporate other concerns. For example, many analyses that 
  approach climate change mitigation from a cost-effectiveness perspective try 
  to bring in considerations of equity and sustainability through their treatment 
  of costs, benefits, and welfare. Similarly, the class of studies that are motivated 
  strongly by considerations of inter-country equity tend to argue that equity 
  is needed to ensure that developing countries can pursue their internal goals 
  of sustainable development-a concept that includes the implicit components 
  of sustainability and efficiency. Likewise, analysts focused on concerns of 
  global sustainability have been compelled by their own logic to make a case 
  for global efficiency-often modelled as the decoupling of production from 
  material flows-and social equity. In other words, each of the three perspectives 
  has led writers to search for ways to incorporate concerns that lie beyond their 
  initial starting point. All three classes of analyses look at the relationship 
  of climate change mitigation with all three goals-development, equity, 
  and sustainability-albeit in different and often highly complementary ways. 
  Nevertheless, they frame the issues differently, focus on different sets of 
  causal relationships, use different tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat 
  different conclusions. </p>
<p>There is no presumption that any particular perspective for analysis is most 
  appropriate at any level. Moreover, the three perspectives are viewed here as 
  being highly synergistic. The important changes have been primarily in the types 
  of questions being asked and the kinds of information being sought. In practice, 
  the literature has expanded to add new issues and new tools, subsuming rather 
  than discarding the analyses included in the other perspectives. The range and 
  scope of climate policy analyses can be understood as a gradual broadening of 
  the types and extent of uncertainties that analysts have been willing and able 
  to address. </p>
<p>The first perspective on climate policy analysis is cost effectiveness. It 
  represents the field of conventional climate policy analysis that is well represented 
  in the First through Third Assessments. These analyses have generally been driven 
  directly or indirectly by the question of what is the most cost-effective amount 
  of mitigation for the global economy starting from a particular baseline GHG 
  emissions projection, reflecting a specific set of socio-economic projections. 
  Within this framework, important issues include measuring the performance of 
  various technologies and the removal of barriers (such as existing subsidies) 
  to the implementation of those candidate policies most likely to contribute 
  to emissions reductions. In a sense, the focus of analysis here has been on 
  identifying an efficient pathway through the interactions of mitigation policies 
  and economic development, conditioned by considerations of equity and sustainability, 
  but not primarily guided by them. At this level, policy analysis has almost 
  always taken the existing institutions and tastes of individuals as given; assumptions 
  that might be valid for a decade or two, but may become more questionable over 
  many decades.</p>
<p>The impetus for the expansion in the scope of the climate policy analysis and 
  discourse to include equity considerations was to address not simply the impacts 
  of climate change and mitigation policies on global welfare as a whole, but 
  also of the effects of climate change and mitigation policies on existing inequalities 
  among and within nations. The literature on equity and climate change has advanced 
  considerably over the last two decades, but there is no consensus on what constitutes 
  fairness. Once equity issues were introduced into the assessment agenda, though, 
  they became important components in defining the search for efficient emissions 
  mitigation pathways. The considerable literature that indicated how environmental 
  policies could be hampered or even blocked by those who considered them unfair 
  became relevant. In light of these results, it became clear how and why any 
  widespread perception that a mitigation strategy is unfair would likely engender 
  opposition to that strategy, perhaps to the extent of rendering it non-optimal 
  (or even infeasible, as could be the case if non-Annex I countries never participate). 
  Some cost-effectiveness analyses had, in fact, laid the groundwork for applying 
  this literature by demonstrating the sensitivity of some equity measures to 
  policy design, national perspective, and regional context. Indeed, cost-effectiveness 
  analyses had even highlighted similar sensitivities for other measures of development 
  and sustainability. As mentioned, the analyses that start from equity concerns 
  have by and large focused on the needs of developing countries, and in particular 
  on the commitment expressed in Article 3.4 of the UNFCCC to the pursuit of sustainable 
  development. Countries differ in ways that have dramatic implications for scenario 
  baselines and the range of mitigation options that can be considered. The climate 
  policies that are feasible, and/or desirable, in a particular country depend 
  significantly on its available resources and institutions, and on its overall 
  objectives including climate change as but one component. Recognizing this heterogeneity 
  may, thus, lead to a different range of policy options than has been considered 
  likely thus far and may reveal differences in the capacities of different sectors 
  that may also enhance appreciation of what can be done by non-state actors to 
  improve their ability to mitigate.</p>
<p>The third perspective is global sustainability and societal learning. While 
  sustainability has been incorporated in the analyses in a number of ways, a 
  class of studies takes the issue of global sustainability as their point of 
  departure. These studies focus on alternative pathways to pursue global sustainability 
  and address issues like decoupling growth from resource flows, for example through 
  eco-intelligent production systems, resource light infrastructure and appropriate 
  technologies, and decoupling wellbeing from production, for example through 
  intermediate performance levels, regionalization of production systems, and 
  changing lifestyles. One popular method for identifying constraints and opportunities 
  within this perspective is to identify future sustainable states and then examine 
  possible transition paths to those states for feasibility and desirability. 
  In the case of developing countries this leads to a number of possible strategies 
  that can depart significantly from those which the developed countries pursued 
  in the past.</p>
