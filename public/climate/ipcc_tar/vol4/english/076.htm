          (a) shows changes in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide 
          (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) 
          over the past 1000 years. The ice core and firn data for several sites 
          in Antarctica and Greenland (shown by different symbols) are supplemented 
          with the data from direct atmospheric samples over the past few decades 
          (shown by the line for CO<sub>2</sub> and incorporated in the curve 
          representing the global average of CH<sub>4</sub>). The estimated positive 
          radiative forcing of the climate system from these gases is indicated 
          on the right-hand scale. Since these gases have atmospheric lifetimes 
          of a decade or more, they are well mixed, and their concentrations reflect 
          emissions from sources throughout the globe. All three records show 
          effects of the large and increasing growth in anthropogenic emissions 
          during the Industrial Era. <br> <br>
          (b) illustrates the influence of industrial emissions on atmospheric 
          sulphate concentrations, which produce negative radiative forcing. Shown 
          is the time history of the concentrations of sulphate, not in the atmosphere 
          but in ice cores in Greenland (shown by lines; from which the episodic 
          effects of volcanic eruptions have been removed). Such data indicate 
          the local deposition of sulphate aerosols at the site, reflecting sulphur 
          dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions at mid-latitudes in the Northern 
          Hemisphere. This record, albeit more regional than that of the globally-mixed 
          greenhouse gases, demonstrates the large growth in anthropogenic SO<sub>2</sub> 
          emissions during the Industrial Era. The pluses denote the relevant 
          regional estimated SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (right-hand scale).<br>

    phenomenon (which consistently affects regional variations of precipitation 
    and temperature over much of the tropics, sub-tropics and some mid-latitude 
    areas) have been more frequent, persistent and intense since the mid-1970s, 
    compared with the previous 100 years. 
  <li>Over the 20th century (1900 to 1995), there were relatively small increases 
    in global land areas experiencing severe drought or severe wetness. In many 
    regions, these changes are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal climate 
    variability, such as the shift in ENSO towards more warm events.
  <li>In some regions, such as parts of Asia and Africa, the frequency and intensity 
    of droughts have been observed to increase in recent decades.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Some important aspects of climate appear not to have changed.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A few areas of the globe have not warmed in recent decades, mainly over 
    some parts of the Southern Hemisphere oceans and parts of Antarctica.
  <li>No significant trends of Antarctic sea-ice extent are apparent since 1978, 
    the period of reliable satellite measurements.
  <li>Changes globally in tropical and extra-tropical storm intensity and frequency 
    are dominated by inter-decadal to multi-decadal variations, with no significant 
    trends evident over the 20th century. Conflicting analyses make it difficult 
    to draw definitive conclusions about changes in storm activity, especially 
    in the extra-tropics.
  <li>No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder days, or hail 
    events are evident in the limited areas analysed.<br>
</ul>
<h3>Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue 
  to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate.</h3>
<p>Changes in climate occur as a result of both internal variability within the 
  climate system and external factors (both natural and anthropogenic). The influence 
  of external factors on climate can be broadly compared using the concept of 
  radiative forcing<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>8</sup></small></a>. 
  A positive radiative forcing, such as that produced by increasing concentrations 
  of greenhouse gases, tends to warm the surface. A negative radiative forcing, 
  which can arise from an increase in some types of aerosols (microscopic airborne 
  particles) tends to cool the surface. Natural factors, such as changes in solar 
  output or explosive volcanic activity, can also cause radiative forcing. Characterisation 
  of these climate forcing agents and their changes over time (see <a href="#figspm2">Figure 
  2</a>) is required to understand past climate changes in the context of natural 
  variations and to project what climate changes could lie ahead. <a href="#figspm3">Figure 
  3</a> shows current estimates of the radiative forcing due to increased concentrations 
  of atmospheric constituents and other mechanisms.</p>
<h4>Concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and their radiative forcing 
  have continued to increase as a result of human activities.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has increased 
    by 31% since 1750. The present CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has not been exceeded 
    during the past 420,000 years and likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    not during the past 20 million years. The current rate of increase is unprecedented 
    during at least the past 20,000 years.
  <li>About three-quarters of the anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> to 
    the atmosphere during the past 20 years is due to fossil fuel burning. The 
    rest is predominantly due to land-use change, especially deforestation.
  <li>Currently the ocean and the land together are taking up about half of the 
    anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. On land, the uptake of anthropogenic 
    CO<sub>2</sub> very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    exceeded the release of CO<sub>2</sub> by deforestation during the 1990s.
  <li>The rate of increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has been 
    about 1.5 ppm<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
    (0.4%) per year over the past two decades. During the 1990s the year to year 
    increase varied from 0.9 ppm (0.2%) to 2.8 ppm (0.8%). A large part of this 
    variability is due to the effect of climate variability (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o 
    events) on CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and release by land and oceans.
  <li>The atmospheric concentration of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) has increased 
    by 1060 ppb<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
    (151%) since 1750 and continues to increase. The present CH<sub>4</sub> concentration 
    has not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years. The annual growth in 
    CH<sub>4</sub> concentration slowed and became more variable in the 1990s, 
    compared with the 1980s. Slightly more than half of current CH<sub>4</sub> 
    emissions are anthropogenic (e.g., use of fossil fuels, cattle, rice agriculture 
    and landfills). In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions have recently 
    been identified as a cause of increasing CH<sub>4</sub> concentration. 
  <li>The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has increased 
    by 46 ppb (17%) since 1750 and continues to increase. The present N<sub>2</sub>O 
    concentration has not been exceeded during at least the past thousand years. 
    About a third of current N<sub>2</sub>O emissions are anthropogenic (e.g., 
    agricultural soils, cattle feed lots and chemical industry). 
  <li>Since 1995, the atmospheric concentrations of many of those halocarbon gases 
    that are both ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases (e.g., CFCl<sub>3</sub> 
    and CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), are either increasing more slowly or decreasing, 
    both in response to reduced emissions under the regulations of the Montreal 
    Protocol and its Amendments. Their substitute compounds (e.g., CHF<sub>2</sub>Cl 
    and CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>F) and some other synthetic compounds (e.g., 
    perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)) are also 
    greenhouse gases, and their concentrations are currently increasing.
  <li>The radiative forcing due to increases of the well-mixed greenhouse gases 
    from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be 2.43 Wm<sup>-2</sup>: 1.46 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
    from CO<sub>2</sub>; 0.48 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from CH<sub>4</sub>; 0.34 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
    from the halocarbons; and 0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from N<sub>2</sub>O. (See <a href="#figspm3">Figure 
    3</a>, where the uncertainties are also illustrated.)
  <li>The observed depletion of the stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) layer 
    from 1979 to 2000 is estimated to have caused a negative radiative forcing 
    (-0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). Assuming full compliance with current halocarbon 
    regulations, the positive forcing of the halocarbons will be reduced as will 
    the magnitude of the negative forcing from stratospheric ozone depletion as 
    the ozone layer recovers over the 21st century.
  <li>The total amount of O<sub>3</sub> in the troposphere is estimated to have 
    increased by 36% since 1750, due primarily to anthropogenic emissions of several 
    O<sub>3</sub>-forming gases. This corresponds to a positive radiative forcing 
    of 0.35 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. O<sub>3</sub> forcing varies considerably by region 
    and responds much more quickly to changes in emissions than the long-lived 
    greenhouse gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>

      <p><b>Figure 3:</b> Many external factors force climate change. These radiative 
        forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration 
        of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the output of the 
        sun. Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked 
        to each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions 
        of these forcings - some of which yield warming, and some cooling. Forcing 
        due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting 
        only for a few years, is not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown 
        is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect 
        effect of aerosols on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which 
        would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation 
        on greenhouse gases are included in the individual bars. The vertical 
        line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided 
        by the spread in the published values of the forcings and physical understanding. 
        Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than others. 
        A vertical line without a rectangular bar denotes a forcing for which 
        no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall 
        level of scientific understanding for each forcing varies considerably, 
        as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the 
        globe, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby perturbing the global heat balance. 
        Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because 
        of their spatial distribution, such as aerosols. For this and other reasons, 
        a simple sum of the positive and negative bars cannot be expected to yield 
        the net effect on the climate system. The simulations of this assessment 
        report (for example, Figure 5) indicate that the estimated net effect 
        of these perturbations is to have warmed the global climate since 1750.
