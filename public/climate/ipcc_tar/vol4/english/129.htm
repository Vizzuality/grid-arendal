<h2>2.4. Costing and Valuation </h2>
<p>Methods of economic costing and valuation rely on the notion of opportunity 
  cost of resources used, degraded, or saved. Opportunity cost depends on whether 
  the market is competitive or monopolistic and on whether any externalities are 
  internalized. It also depends on the rate at which the future is discounted, 
  which can vary across countries, over time, and over generations. The impact 
  of uncertainty also can be valued if the probabilities of different possible 
  outcomes are known. Public and nonmarket goods and services can be valued through 
  willingness to pay for them or willingness to accept compensation for lack of 
  them. Impacts on different groups, societies, nations, and species must be assessed. 
  Comparison of alternative distributions of welfare across individuals and groups 
  within a country can be justified if they are made according to internally consistent 
  norms. Comparisons across nations with different societal, ethical, and governmental 
  structures cannot yet be made meaningfully. </p>
<p><i>Since the SAR, no new fundamental developments in costing and valuation 
  methodology have taken place.</i> Many new applications of existing methods 
  to a widening range of climate change issues have demonstrated, however, the 
  strengths and limitations of some of these methods. Research efforts are required 
  to strengthen methods for multi-objective assessments. Multi-objective assessments 
  are increasingly preferred, but the means by which their underlying metrics 
  might more accurately reflect diverse social, political, economic, and cultural 
  contexts must be developed. In addition, methods for integrating across these 
  multiple metrics are still missing from the methodological repertoire. [<a href="../../wg2/093.htm">2.5</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="25"></a>2.5. Decision Analytic Frameworks</h2>
<p>Policymakers who are responsible for devising and implementing adaptive policies 
  should be able to rely on results from one or more of a diverse set of decision 
  analytical frameworks. Commonly used methods include cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness 
  analysis, various types of decision analysis (including multi-objective studies), 
  and participatory techniques such as policy exercises.</p>
<p><i>Very few cases in which policymakers have used decision analytical frameworks 
  in evaluating adaptation options have been reported.</i> Among the large number 
  of assessments of climate change impacts reviewed in the TAR, only a small fraction 
  include comprehensive and quantitative estimates of adaptation options and their 
  costs, benefits, and uncertainty characteristics. This information is necessary 
  for meaningful applications of any decision analytical method to issues of adaptation. 
  Greater use of such methods in support of adaptation decisions is needed to 
  establish their efficacy and to identify directions for necessary research in 
  the context of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. [<a href="../../wg2/112.htm">2.7</a>]</p>
