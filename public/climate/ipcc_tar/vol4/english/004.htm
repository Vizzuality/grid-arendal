<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This Synthesis Report with its Summary for Policymakers is the fourth and final 
  part of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
  Climate Change (IPCC). It draws together and integrates for the benefit of policy 
  makers, and others, and in response to questions identified by governments and 
  subsequently agreed by the IPCC, information that has been approved and/ or 
  accepted by the IPCC.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnpre.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  It is intended to assist governments, individually and collectively, in formulating 
  appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses to the threat of human-induced 
  climate change. </p>
<p>The Synthesis Report is based mainly on the contributions of the three IPCC 
  Working Groups to the TAR, but also uses information from earlier IPCC assessments, 
  Special Reports, and Technical Papers. It follows the question and answer format, 
  and is in two parts: a Summary for Policymakers and a longer document that contains 
  expanded responses to each of the questions posed by governments. The Summary 
  for Policymakers references the appropriate paragraphs in the longer report, 
  while the longer report contains references to the source of the material on 
  which the response is based --  that is, the Summaries for Policymakers and 
  chapters from previously approved and accepted Working Group contributions to 
  the TAR and earlier IPCC reports and Technical Papers (see the accompanying 
  box for cross-referencing nomenclature). </p>
<p>The procedures for approving the Summary for Policymakers and adopting the 
  balance of the Synthesis Report were formalized by the IPCC at its Fifteenth 
  Session (San Jose, Costa Rica, 15-18 April 1999). A draft of the Synthesis 
  Report and its Summary for Policymakers was prepared by a team of lead authors, 
  who were involved in preparation of the TAR, and submitted for simultaneous 
  government/ technical and expert review. The revised drafts were circulated 
  to governments in a final distribution before approval/ adoption at the IPCC's 
  Eighteenth Session (Wembley, United Kingdom, 24- 29 September 2001). </p>
<p>The Synthesis Report consists of nine policy-relevant questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="017.htm">Question 1</a> addresses the ultimate objective of the 
    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is found in Article 
    2 (i. e., what constitutes &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference in the 
    climate system&quot;) and provides a framework for placing the issue of climate 
    change in the context of sustainable development. </li>
  <li><a href="019.htm">Question 2</a> assesses and, where possible, attributes 
    observed changes in climate and ecological systems since the pre-industrial 
    era. </li>
  <li><a href="026.htm">Questions 3</a> and <a href="037.htm">4</a> assess the 
    impact of future emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol precursors 
    (without specific policies to mitigate climate change) on climate, including 
    changes in variability and extreme events and in ecological and socio-economic 
    systems. </li>
  <li><a href="041.htm">Question 5</a> discusses inertia in the climate, ecological 
    systems, and socio-economic sectors, and implications for mitigation and adaptation. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="047.htm">Question 6</a> assesses the near-and long-term implications 
    of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases on climate, 
    ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors. </li>
  <li><a href="051.htm">Question 7</a> assesses the technologies, policies, and 
    costs of near-and long-term actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="059.htm">Question 8</a> identifies the interactions between climate 
    change, other environmental issues, and development. </li>
  <li><a href="067.htm">Question 9</a> summarizes the most robust findings and 
    key uncertainties. </li>
</ul>
<p>We take this opportunity to thank: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Core Writing Team who drafted this report and, with their meticulous 
    and painstaking attention to detail, finalized it </li>
  <li>Other members of the IPCC Bureau who acted as Review Editors </li>
  <li>The members of the Working Groups' teams of Coordinating Lead Authors and 
    Lead Authors who helped with the initial drafting </li>
  <li>The Heads and the staff of the Technical Support Units of the three Working 
    Groups, particularly David Dokken, Maria Noguer, and Paul van der Linden for 
    logistical and editorial support </li>
  <li>The Head and the staff of the GRID office at Arendal, Norway --  Philippe 
    Rekacewicz in particular --  for working with the author team on the graphics 
    contained in the Synthesis Report </li>
  <li>The staff of the IPCC Secretariat for innumerable administrative tasks performed. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Synthesis Report with its Summary for Policymakers is published here in
   a single volume together with the Summaries for Policymakers and Technical
  Summaries 
  of the Working Group contributions to the TAR, as well as a comprehensive,
  consolidated  glossary. The Synthesis Report is also available in Arabic, Chinese,
  French, 
  Russian, and Spanish --  the other official languages of the IPCC. The Synthesis
   Report is also available as a stand-alone publication, as are discrete brochures
  
  consisting of the Summaries for Policymakers, Technical Summaries, and glossaries
   of the respective Working Group reports. The full English text of all four
  volumes 
  comprising the Third Assessment Report has been published in both print and
   digital form, with searchable versions available on cd-rom and at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipcc.ch">http://www.ipcc.ch</a>. </p>
