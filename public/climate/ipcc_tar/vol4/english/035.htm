      Quantitative evaluation of their benefits and costs and how they vary across 
      regions and entities is incomplete. Adaptation to climate change can take 
      many forms, including actions taken by people with the intent of lessening 
      impacts or utilizing new opportunities, and structural and functional changes 
      in natural systems made in response to changes in pressures. The focus in 
      this report is on the adaptive actions of people. The range of options includes 
      reactive adaptations (actions taken concurrent with changed conditions and 
      without prior preparation) and planned adaptations (actions taken either 
      concurrent with or in anticipation of changed conditions, but with prior 
      preparation). Adaptations can be taken by private entities (e.g., individuals, 
      households, or business firms) or by public entities (e.g., local, state, 
      or national government agencies). Examples of identified options are listed 
      in <a href="#tbl36">Table 3-6</a>. The benefits and costs of adaptation 
      options, evaluation of which is incomplete, will also vary across regions 
      and entities. Despite the incomplete and evolving state of knowledge about 
      adaptation, a number of robust findings have been derived and summarized.<br>

      to be adapted to include the magnitudes and rates of changes in climate 
      extremes, variability, and mean conditions. Natural and human systems have 
      evolved capabilities to cope with a range of climate variability within 
      which the risks of damage are relatively low and ability to recover is high. 
      Changes in climate that result in increased frequency of events that fall 
      outside the historic range with which systems have coped, however, increase 
      the risk of severe damages and incomplete recovery or collapse of the system. 
      Changes in mean conditions (e.g., increases in average temperature), even 
      in the absence of changes in variance, can lead to increases in the frequencies 
      of some events (e.g., more frequent heat waves) that exceed the coping range, 
      and decreases in the frequencies of others (e.g., less frequent cold spells) 
      (see <a href="037.htm">Question 4</a> and <a href="037.htm#figspm41">Figure 
      4-1</a>).<br>

      impacts of climate change.</span> Results of studies of future impacts of 
      climate change indicate the potential for adaptation to substantially reduce 
      many of the adverse impacts and enhance beneficial impacts. For example, 
      analyses of coastal flood risks from storm surges estimate that climate 
      change-driven sea-level rise would increase the average annual number of 
      people flooded many-fold if coastal flood protection is unchanged from the 
      present. But if coastal flood protection is enhanced in proportion to future 
      GDP growth, the projected increase is cut by as much as two-thirds (see 
      <a href="036.htm#figspm36">Figure 3-6</a>). However, estimates such as these 
      indicate only potential benefits from adaptation, not the likely benefits -- as 
      analyses generally use arbitrary assumptions about adaptation options and 
      obstacles, often omit consideration of changes in climate extremes and variability, 
      and do not account for imperfect foresight.<br>
