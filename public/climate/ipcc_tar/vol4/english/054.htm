          mitigation opportunities exist. </span>According to bottom-up assessments 
          (see <a href="053.htm#box71">Box 7-1</a>) of specific 
          technologies and sectors, half of the potential emissions reductions 
          noted in <a href="051.htm#tab7-1">Table 7-1</a> may be 
          achieved by the year 2020 with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, 
          and the other half at a net direct cost of up to US$100 per t C<sub>eq</sub> 
          (at 1998 prices). However, for reasons described below, the realized 
          potential may be different. These cost estimates are derived using discount 
          rates in the range of 5 to 12%, consistent with public-sector discount 
          rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly, and are often 
          significantly higher, affecting the rate of adoption of these technologies 
          by private entities. Depending on the emissions scenario, this could 
          allow global emissions to be reduced below year 2000 levels in the period 
          2010-2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing these reductions 
          involves additional implementation costs, which in some cases may be 
          substantial, the possible need for supporting policies, increased R&amp;D, 
          effective technology transfer, and overcoming other barriers. The various 
          global, regional, national, sector, and project studies assessed in 
          the WGIII TAR have different scopes and assumptions. Studies do not 
          exist for every sector and region.<br>

        among models within regions is due to varying assumptions about future 
        GDP growth rates and changes in carbon and energy intensity (different 
        socio-economic development paths). The same reasons also apply to differences 
        across regions. These models assume that national policy instruments are 
        efficient and consistent with international policy instruments. That is, 
        they assume that reductions are made through the use of market mechanisms 
        (e.g., cap and trade) within each region. To the extent that regions employ 
        a mix of market mechanisms and command and control policies, costs will 
        likely be higher. On the other hand, inclusion of carbon sinks, non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
        greenhouse gases, induced technical change, ancillary benefits, or targeted 
        revenue recycling could reduce costs.<br>

          given countries, and thus could complement domestic policy mechanisms, 
          and could minimize risks of inequitable international impacts.</span> 
          For example, the brown and blue lines in <a href="#figspm72">Figure 
          7-2b</a> and <a href="055.htm#tbl7-3">Table 7-3</a><a href="055.htm#tbl7-3">b</a> 
          show that the national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets range 
          from about US$20 up to US$600 per t C without Annex B trading, and range 
          from about US$15 up to US$150 per t C with Annex B trading, respectively. 
          At the time of these studies, most models did not include sinks, non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
          greenhouse gases, CDM, negative cost options, ancillary benefits, or 
          targeted revenue recycling, which will reduce estimated costs. On the 
          other hand, these models make assumptions which underestimate costs 
          because they assume full use of emissions trading without transaction 
          costs, both within and among Annex B countries, and that mitigation 
          responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies begin to adjust 
          to the need to meet Kyoto targets between the years 1990 and 2000. The 
          cost reductions from Annex B trading will depend on the details of implementation, 
          including the compatibility of domestic and international mechanisms, 
          constraints, and transaction costs. The following is indicative of the 
          broad variation in the change in GDP reported for Annex B countries:

            show reductions in GDP, compared to projected levels in the year 2010. 
            <a href="#figspm72">Figure 7-2</a> indicates that in 
            the absence of Annex B trading losses range from 0.2 to 2% of GDP. 
            With Annex B trading, losses range from 0.1 to 1% of GDP. National 
            studies, which explore a more diverse set of policy packages and take 
            account of specific national circumstances, vary even more widely.</div>

            from negligible to a several percent increase, reflecting opportunities

            Under assumptions of drastic energy-efficiency improvement and/or 
            continuing economic recessions in some countries, the assigned amounts 
            may exceed projected emissions in the first commitment period. In 
            this case, models show increased GDP due to revenues from trading 
            assigned amounts. However, for some economies in transition, implementing 
            the Kyoto Protocol will have similar impact on GDP as for Annex II
