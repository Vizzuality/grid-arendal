<h2><a name="85"></a>8.5 Aspects of International Emission Trading</h2>
<p>It has long been recognized that international trade in emission quota can 
  reduce mitigation costs. This will occur when countries with high domestic marginal 
  abatement costs purchase emission quota from countries with low marginal abatement 
  costs. This is often referred to as "where flexibility". That is, 
  allowing reductions to take place where it is cheapest to do so regardless of 
  geographical location. It is important to note that where the reductions take 
  place is independent of who pays for the reductions.<br>

<p>"Where flexibility" can occur on a number of scales. It can be global, 
  regional or at the country level. In the theoretical case of full global trading, 
  all countries agree to emission caps and participate in the international market 
  as buyers or sellers of emission allowances. The CDM may allow some of these 
  cost reductions to be captured. When the market is defined at the regional level 
  (e.g., Annex B countries), the trading market is more limited. Finally, trade 
  may take place domestically with all emission reductions occurring in the country 
  of origin.</p>
<p><a href="#tabTS5">Table TS.5</a> shows the cost reductions from emission trading 
  for Annex B and full global trading compared to a no-trading case. The calculation 
  is made by various models with both global and regional detail. In each instance, 
  the goal is to meet the emission reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol. 
  All of the models show significant gains as the size of the trading market is 
  expanded. The difference among models is due in part to differences in their 
  baseline, the assumptions about the cost and availability of low-cost substitutes 
  on both the supply and demand sides of the energy sector, and the treatment 
  of short-term macro shocks. In general, all calculated gross costs for the non-trading 
  case are below 2% of GDP (which is assumed to have increased significantly in 
  the period considered) and in most cases below 1%. Annex B trading lowers the 
  costs for the OECD region as a whole to less than 0.5% and regional impacts 
  within this vary between 0.1% to 1.1%. Global trading in general would decrease 
  these costs to well below 0.5% of GDP with OECD average below 0.2%.</p>
<p>The issue of the so-called "hot air"<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg3fnts.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>17</a></sup></small> 
  also influences the cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. The recent decline 
  in economic activity in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has led to 
  a decrease in their GHG emissions. Although this trend is eventually expected 
  to reverse, for some countries emissions are still projected to lie below the 
  constraint imposed by the Kyoto Protocol. If this does occur, these countries 
  will have excess emission quota that may be sold to countries in search of low-cost 
  options for meeting their own targets. The cost savings from trading are sensitive 
  to the magnitude of "hot air".</p>
<p>Numerous assessments of reduction in projected GDP have been associated with 
  complying with Kyoto-type limits. Most economic analyses have focused on gross 
  costs of carbon emitting activities<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg3fnts.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>18</a></sup></small>, 
  ignoring the cost-saving potential of mitigating non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases and 
  using carbon sequestration and neither taking into account environmental benefits 
  (ancillary benefits and avoided climate change), nor using revenues to remove 
  distortions. Including such possibilities could lower costs. </p>
<p>A constraint would lead to a reallocation of resources away from the pattern 
  that is preferred in the absence of a limit and into potentially costly conservation 
  and fuel substitution. Relative prices will also change. These forced adjustments 
  lead to reductions in economic performance, which impact GDP. Clearly, the broader 
  the permit trading market, the greater the opportunity for reducing overall 
  mitigation costs. Conversely, limits on the extent to which a country can satisfy 
  its obligations through the purchase of emissions quota can increase mitigation 
  costs. Several studies have calculated the magnitude of the increase to be substantial 
  falling in particular on countries with the highest marginal abatement costs. 
  But another parameter likely to limit the savings from carbon trading is the 
  very functioning of trading systems (transaction costs, management costs, insurance 
  against uncertainty, and strategic behaviour in the use of permits). </p>
<h2>
  <a name="86"></a>8.6 Ancillary Benefits of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation </h2>
<p>Policies aimed at mitigating greenhouse gases can have positive and negative 
  side effects on society, not taking into account benefits of avoided climate 
  change. This section assesses in particular those studies that evaluate the 
  side effects of climate change mitigation. Therefore the term "ancillary 
  benefits or costs" is used. There is little agreement on the definition, 
  reach, and size of these ancillary benefits, and on methodologies for integrating 
  them into climate policy. Criteria are established for reviewing the growing 
  literature linking specific carbon mitigation policies to monetized ancillary 
  benefits. Recent studies that take an economy-wide, rather than a sectoral, 
  approach to ancillary benefits are described in the report and their credibility 
  is examined (<a href="../../wg3/353.htm">Chapter 
  9</a> presents sectoral analyses). In spite of recent progress in methods development, 
  it remains very challenging to develop quantitative estimates of the ancillary 
  effects, benefits and costs of GHG mitigation policies. Despite these difficulties, 
  in the short term, ancillary benefits of GHG policies under some circumstances 
  can be a significant fraction of private (direct) mitigation costs and in some 
  cases they can be comparable to the mitigation costs. According to the literature, 
  ancillary benefits may be of particular importance in developing countries, 
  but this literature is as yet limited.</p>
<p>The exact magnitude, scale, and scope of these ancillary benefits and costs 
  will vary with local geographical and baseline conditions. In some circumstances, 
  where baseline conditions involve relatively low carbon emissions and population 
  density, benefits may be low. The models most in use for ancillary benefit estimation 
  - the computable general equilibrium (CGE) models - have difficulty 
  in estimating ancillary benefits because they rarely have, and may not be able 
  to have, the necessary spatial detail. </p>
<p>With respect to baseline considerations most of the literature on ancillary 
  benefits systematically treats only government policies and regulations with 
  respect to the environment. In contrast, other regulatory policy baseline issues, 
  such as those relating to energy, transportation, and health, have been generally 
  ignored, as have baseline issues that are not regulatory, such as those tied 
  with technology, demography, and the natural resource base. For the studies 
  reviewed here, the biggest share of the ancillary benefits is related to public 
  health. A major component of uncertainty for modelling ancillary benefits for 
  public health is the link between emissions and atmospheric concentrations, 
  particularly in light of the importance of secondary pollutants. However, it 
  is recognized that there are significant ancillary benefits in addition to those 
  for public health that have not been quantified or monetized. At the same time, 
  it appears that there are major gaps in the methods and models for estimating 
  ancillary costs.</p>
