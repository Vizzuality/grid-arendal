<h2>2.7. Adaptation is a Necessary Strategy at All Scales to Complement Climate 
  Change Mitigation Efforts </h2>
<p>Adaptation has the potential to reduce adverse impacts of climate change and 
  to enhance beneficial impacts, but will incur costs and will not prevent all 
  damages. Extremes, variability, and rates of change are all key features in 
  addressing vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, not simply changes 
  in average climate conditions. Human and natural systems will to some degree 
  adapt autonomously to climate change. Planned adaptation can supplement autonomous 
  adaptation, though options and incentives are greater for adaptation of human 
  systems than for adaptation to protect natural systems. Adaptation is a necessary 
  strategy at all scales to complement climate change mitigation efforts. [<a href="152.htm">6</a>] 
</p>
<p>Experience with adaptation to climate variability and extremes can be drawn 
  upon to develop appropriate strategies for adapting to anticipated climate change. 
  Adaptation to current climate variability and extremes often produces benefits 
  as well as forming a basis for coping with future climate change. However, experience 
  also demonstrates that there are constraints to achieving the full measure of 
  potential adaptation. In addition, maladaptation, such as promoting development 
  in risk-prone locations, can occur due to decisions based on short-term considerations, 
  neglect of known climatic variability, imperfect foresight, insufficient information, 
  and over-reliance on insurance mechanisms. [<a href="152.htm">6</a>]</p>
<h2><a name="28"></a>2.8 Those with the Least Resources have the Least Capacity 
  to Adapt and are the Most Vulnerable</h2>
<p>The ability of human systems to adapt to and cope with climate change depends 
  on such factors as wealth, technology, education, information, skills, infrastructure, 
  access to resources, and management capabilities. There is potential for developed 
  and developing countries to enhance and/or acquire adaptive capabilities. Populations 
  and communities are highly variable in their endowments with these attributes, 
  and the developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, are 
  generally poorest in this regard. As a result, they have lesser capacity to 
  adapt and are more vulnerable to climate change damages, just as they are more 
  vulnerable to other stresses. This condition is most extreme among the poorest 
  people. [<a href="152.htm#61">6.1</a>; see also<a href="142.htm#517"> 5.1.7</a>, 
  <a href="144.htm#527">5.2.7</a>, <a href="146.htm#535">5.3.5</a>, <a href="147.htm#546">5.4.6</a>, 
  <a href="149.htm#561">5.6.1</a>, <a href="149.htm#562">5.6.2</a>, <a href="150.htm">5.7</a>, 
  and <a href="151.htm#581">5.8.1</a> for regional-scale information]</p>
<p>Benefits and costs of climate change effects have been estimated in monetary 
  units and aggregated to national, regional, and global scales. These estimates 
  generally exclude the effects of changes in climate variability and extremes, 
  do not account for the effects of different rates of change, and only partially 
  account for impacts on goods and services that are not traded in markets. These 
  omissions are likely to result in underestimates of economic losses and overestimates 
  of economic gains. Estimates of aggregate impacts are controversial because 
  they treat gains for some as canceling out losses for others and because the 
  weights that are used to aggregate across individuals are necessarily subjective. 
  [<a href="154.htm">7.2.2</a> and <a href="154.htm#723">7.2.3</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the limitations expressed above, based on a few published estimates, 
  increases in global mean temperature<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
  would produce net economic losses in many developing countries for all magnitudes 
  of warming studied (low confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>), 
  and losses would be greater in magnitude the higher the level of warming (medium 
  confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  In contrast, an increase in global mean temperature of up to a few &deg;C would 
  produce a mixture of economic gains and losses in developed countries (low <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>), 
  with economic losses for larger temperature increases (medium confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  The projected distribution of economic impacts is such that it would increase 
  the disparity in well-being between developed countries and developing countries, 
  with disparity growing for higher projected temperature increases (medium confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  The more damaging impacts estimated for developing countries reflects, in part, 
  their lesser adaptive capacity relative to developed countries. [<a href="154.htm#723">7.2.3</a>]</p>
<p>Further, when aggregated to a global scale, world gross domestic product (GDP) 
  would change by &plusmn; a few percent for global mean temperature increases 
  of up to a few &deg;C (low confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>), 
  and increasing net losses would result for larger increases in temperature (medium 
  confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>) 
  (see <a href="111.htm#figspm2">Figure SPM-2</a>). More people are projected 
  to be harmed than benefited by climate change, even for global mean temperature 
  increases of less than a few &deg;C (low confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  These results are sensitive to assumptions about changes in regional climate, 
  level of development, adaptive capacity, rate of change, the valuation of impacts, 
  and the methods used for aggregating monetary losses and gains, including the 
  choice of discount rate. [<a href="154.htm">7.2.2</a>]</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are expected to be greatest in developing countries 
  in terms of loss of life and relative effects on investment and the economy. 
  For example, the relative percentage damages to GDP from climate extremes have 
  been substantially greater in developing countries than in developed countries. 
  [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>] </p>
<h2><a name="29"></a>2.9. Adaptation, Sustainable Development, and Enhancement 
  of Equity can be Mutually Reinforcing</h2>
Many communities and regions that are vulnerable to climate change are also under 
pressure from forces such as population growth, resource depletion, and poverty. 
Policies that lessen pressures on resources, improve management of environmental 
risks, and increase the welfare of the poorest members of society can simultaneously 
advance sustainable development and equity, enhance adaptive capacity, and reduce 
vulnerability to climate and other stresses. Inclusion of climatic risks in the 
design and implementation of national and international development initiatives 
can promote equity and development that is more sustainable and that reduces vulnerability 
to climate change. [<a href="152.htm#62">6.2</a>]
