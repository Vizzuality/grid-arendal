<h2><a name="figts10a"></a><a name="101"></a>10.1 Scope for and New Developments 
  in Analyses for Climate Change Decisions</h2>
<p>Decision making frameworks (DMFs) related to climate change involve multiple 
  levels ranging from global negotiations to individual choices and a diversity 
  of actors with different resource endowments, and diverging values and aspirations. 
  This explains why it is difficult to arrive at a management strategy that is 
  acceptable for all. The dynamic interplay among economic sectors and related 
  social interest groups makes it difficult to arrive at a national position to 
  be represented at international fora in the first place. The intricacies of 
  international climate negotiations result from the manifold often-ambiguous 
  national positions as well as from the linkages of climate change policy with 
  other socio-economic objectives.</p>
<p>No DMF can reproduce the above diversity in its full richness. Yet analysts 
  have made significant progress in several directions since SAR. First, they 
  integrate an increasing number of issues into a single analytical framework 
  in order to provide an internally consistent assessment of closely related components, 
  processes, and subsystems. The resulting integrated assessment models (IAMs) 
  cited in <a href="../../wg3/353.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, and indeed throughout the whole report, provide useful insights into 
  a number of climate policy issues for policymakers. Second, scientists pay increasing 
  attention to the broader context of climate related issues that have been ignored 
  or paid marginal attention previously. Among other factors, this has fostered 
  the integration of development, sustainability and equity issues into the present 
  report.</p>
<p>Climate change is profoundly different from most other environmental problems 
  with which humanity has grappled. A combination of several features lends the 
  climate problem its uniqueness. They include public good issues raising from 
  the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere that requires collective global 
  action, the multiplicity of decision makers ranging from global down to the 
  micro level of firms and individuals, and the heterogeneity of emissions and 
  their consequences around the world. Moreover, the long-term nature of climate 
  change originates from the fact that it is the concentration of GHGs that matters 
  rather than their annual emissions and this feature raises the thorny issues 
  of intergenerational transfers of wealth and environmental goods and bads. Next, 
  human activities associated with climate change are widespread, which makes 
  narrowly defined technological solutions impossible, and the interactions of 
  climate policy with other broad socio-economic policies are strong. Finally, 
  large uncertainties or in some areas even ignorance characterize many aspects 
  of the problem and require a risk management approach to be adopted in all DMFs 
  that deal with climate change.</p>

<p><a name="figts10b"></a>Policymakers therefore have to grapple with great uncertainties 
  in choosing the appropriate responses. A wide variety of tools have been applied 
  to help them make fundamental choices. Each of those decision analysis frameworks 
  (DAFs) has its own merits and shortcoming through its ability to address some 
  of the above features well, but other facets less adequately. Recent analyses 
  with well-established tools such as cost-benefit analysis as well as newly 
  developed frameworks like the tolerable windows or safe landing approach provide 
  fresh insights into the problem.</p>
<p><a href="#figts10a">Figure TS.10a</a> shows the results of a cost-effectiveness 
  analysis exploring the optimal hedging strategy when uncertainty with respect 
  to the long-term stabilization target is not resolved until 2020, suggesting 
  that abatement over the next few years would be economically valuable if there 
  is a significant probability of having to stay below ceilings that would be 
  otherwise reached within the characteristic time scales of the systems producing 
  greenhouse gases. The degree of near-term hedging in the above analysis is sensitive 
  to the date of resolution of uncertainty, the inertia in the energy system, 
  and the fact that the ultimate concentration target (once it has been revealed) 
  must be met at all costs. Other experiments, such as those with cost-benefit 
  models framed as a Bayesian decision analysis problem show that optimal near-term 
  (next two decades) emission paths diverge only modestly under perfect foresight, 
  and hedging even for low-probability, high-consequence scenarios (see <a href="#figTS10b">Figure 
  TS.10b</a>). However, decisions about near-term climate policies may have to 
  be made while the stabilization target is still being debated. Decision-making 
  therefore should consider appropriate hedging against future resolution of that 
  target and possible revision of the scientific insights in the risks of climate 
  change. There are significant differences in the two approaches. With a cost-effectiveness 
  analysis, the target must be made regardless of costs. With a cost-benefit analysis, 
  costs and benefits are balanced at the margin. Nevertheless, the basic message 
  is quite similar and involves the explicit incorporation of uncertainty and 
  its sequential resolution over time. The desirable amount of hedging depends 
  upon one's assessment of the stakes, the odds, and the costs of policy 
  measures. The risk premium - the amount that society is willing to pay 
  to reduce risk - ultimately is a political decision that differs among 
  countries.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses seek the lowest cost of achieving an environmental 
  target by equalizing the marginal costs of mitigation across space and time. 
  Long-term cost-effectiveness studies estimate the costs of stabilizing atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at different levels and find that the costs of 
  the 450ppmv ceiling are substantially greater than those of the 750ppmv limit. 
  Rather than seeking a single optimal path, the tolerable windows/safe landing 
  approach seeks to delineate the complete array of possible emission paths that 
  satisfy externally defined climate impact and emission cost constraints. Results 
  indicate that delaying near-term effective emission reductions can drastically 
  reduce the future range of options for relatively tight climate change targets, 
  while less tight targets offer more near-term flexibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="102"></a>10.2 International Regimes and Policy Options</h2>
<p>The structure and characteristics of international agreements on climate change 
  will have a significant influence on the effectiveness and costs and benefits 
  of mitigation. The effectiveness and the costs and benefits of an international 
  climate change regime (such as the Kyoto Protocol or other possible future agreements) 
  depend on the number of signatories to the agreement and their abatement targets 
  and/or policy commitment. At the same time, the number of signatories depends 
  on the question of how equitably the commitments of participants are shared. 
  Economic efficiency (minimizing costs by maximizing participation) and equity 
  (the allocation of emissions limitation commitments) are therefore strongly 
  linked.</p>
<p>There is a three-way relationship between the design of the international regime, 
  the cost-effectiveness/efficiency of climate policies, and the equity of the 
  consequent economic outcomes. As a consequence, it is crucial to design the 
  international regime in a way that is considered both efficient and equitable. 
  The literature presents different theoretical strategies to optimize an international 
  regime. For example, it can be made attractive for countries to join the group 
  that commits to specific targets for limitation and reduction of emissions by 
  increasing the equity of a larger agreement - and therefore its efficiency 
  - through measures like an appropriate distribution of targets over time, 
  the linkage of the climate debate with other issues ("issue linkage"), 
  the use of financial transfers to affected countries ("side payments"), 
  or technology transfer agreements.</p>
<p>Two other important concerns shape the design of an international regime: "implementation" 
  and "compliance". The effectiveness of the regime, which is a function 
  of both implementation and compliance, is related to actual changes of behaviour 
  that promote the goals of the accord. Implementation refers to the translation 
  of international accords into domestic law, policy, and regulations by national 
  governments. Compliance is related to whether and to what extent countries do 
  in fact adhere to provisions of an accord. Monitoring, reporting, and verification 
  are essential for the effectiveness of international environmental regimes, 
  as the systematic monitoring, assessment, and handling of implementation failures 
  have been so far relatively rare. Nonetheless, efforts to provide "systems 
  of implementation review" are growing, and are already incorporated into 
  the UNFCCC structure. The challenge for the future is to make them more effective, 
  especially by improving data on national emissions, policies, and measures.</p>
