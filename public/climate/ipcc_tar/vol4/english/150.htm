<h2>5.7. Polar Regions </h2>
<p><i>Climate change in the polar region is expected to be among the greatest 
  of any region on Earth. Twentieth century data for the Arctic show a warming 
  trend of as much as 5&deg;C over extensive land areas (very high confidence), 
  while precipitation has increased (low confidence).</i> There are some areas 
  of cooling in eastern Canada. The extent of sea ice has decreased by 2.9% per 
  decade, and it has thinned over the 1978-1996 period (high confidence). There 
  has been a statistically significant decrease in spring snow extent over Eurasia 
  since 1915 (high confidence). The area underlain by permafrost has been reduced 
  and has warmed (very high confidence). The layer of seasonally thawed ground 
  above permafrost has thickened in some areas, and new areas of extensive permafrost 
  thawing have developed. In the Antarctic, a marked warming trend is evident 
  in the Antarctic Peninsula, with spectacular loss of ice shelves (high confidence). 
  The extent of higher terrestrial vegetation on the Antarctic Peninsula is increasing 
  (very high confidence). Elsewhere, warming is less definitive. There has been 
  no significant change in the Antarctic sea ice since 1973, although it apparently 
  retreated by more than 3&deg; of latitude between the mid-1950s and the early 
  1970s (medium confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/599.htm">16.1.3.2</a>.]</p>
<p><i>The Arctic is extremely vulnerable to climate change, and major physical, 
  ecological, and economic impacts are expected to appear rapidly.</i> A variety 
  of feedback mechanisms will cause an amplified response, with consequent impacts 
  on other systems and people. There will be different species compositions on 
  land and sea, poleward shifts in species assemblages, and severe disruptions 
  for communities of people who lead traditional lifestyles. <i>In developed areas 
  of the Arctic and where the permafrost is ice-rich, special attention will be 
  required to mitigate the detrimental impacts of thawing, such as severe damage 
  to buildings and transport infrastructure (very high confidence).</i> There 
  also will be beneficial consequences of climatic warming, such as reduced demand 
  for heating energy. Substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean will be 
  favorable for opening of Arctic sea routes and ecotourism, which may have large 
  implications for trade and for local communities. [<a href="../../wg2/607.htm#16253">16.2.5.3</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/610.htm">16.2.7.1</a>, <a href="../../wg2/612.htm">16.2.8.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/612.htm#16282">16.2.8.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>In the Antarctic, projected climate change will generate impacts that will 
  be realized slowly (high confidence).</i> Because the impacts will occur over 
  a long period, however, they will continue long after GHG emissions have stabilized. 
  For example, there will be slow but steady impacts on ice sheets and circulation 
  patterns of the global ocean, which will be irreversible for many centuries 
  into the future and will cause changes elsewhere in the world, including a rise 
  of sea level. Further substantial loss of ice shelves is expected around the 
  Antarctic Peninsula. Warmer temperatures and reduced sea-ice extent are likely 
  to produce long-term changes in the physical oceanography and ecology of the 
  Southern Ocean, with intensified biological activity and increased growth rates 
  of fish. [<a href="../../wg2/603.htm">16.2.3.4</a>, <a href="../../wg2/606.htm">16.2.4.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>Polar regions contain important drivers of climate change.</i> The Southern 
  Ocean's uptake of carbon is projected to reduce substantially as a result of 
  complex physical and biological processes. GHG emissions from tundra caused 
  by changes in water content, decomposition of exposed peat, and thawing of permafrost 
  are expected to increase. Reductions in the extent of highly reflective snow 
  and ice will magnify warming (very high confidence). Freshening of waters from 
  increased Arctic runoff and increased rainfall, melt of Antarctic ice shelves, 
  and reduced sea-ice formation will slow the thermohaline circulations of the 
  North Atlantic and Southern Oceans and reduce the ventilation of deep ocean 
  waters. [<a href="../../wg2/615.htm">16.3.1</a>]</p>
<p><i>Adaptation to climate change will occur in natural polar ecosystems, mainly 
  through migration and changing mixes of species.</i> Some species may become 
  threatened (e.g., walrus, seals, and polar bears), whereas others may flourish 
  (e.g., caribou and fish). Although such changes may be disruptive to many local 
  ecological systems and particular species, the possibility remains that predicted 
  climate change eventually may increase the overall productivity of natural systems 
  in polar regions. [<a href="../../wg2/616.htm">16.3.2</a>]</p>
<p><i>For indigenous communities who follow traditional lifestyles, opportunities 
  for adaptation to climate change are limited (very high confidence).</i> Changes 
  in sea ice, seasonality of snow, habitat, and diversity of food species will 
  affect hunting and gathering practices and could threaten longstanding traditions 
  and ways of life. Technologically developed communities are likely to adapt 
  quite readily to climate change by adopting altered modes of transport and by 
  increased investment to take advantage of new commercial and trade opportunities.
