    <td align="left"><span class="blue2">Extreme weather or climatic events cause 
      substantial, and increasing, damage.</span> Extreme events are currently 
      a major source of climate-related impacts. For example, heavy losses of 
      human life, property damage, and other environmental damages were recorded 
      during the El Ni&ntilde;o event of the years 1997-1998. The impacts 
      of climatic extremes and variability are a major concern. Preliminary indications 
      suggest that some social and economic systems have been affected by recent 
      increases in floods and droughts, with increases in economic losses for 
      catastrophic weather events. Because these systems are also affected by 
      changes in socio-economic factors such as demographic shifts and land-use 
      changes, quantifying the relative impacts of climate change (either anthropogenic 
      or natural) and of socio-economic factors is difficult. For example, direct 
      costs of global catastrophic weather-related losses, corrected for inflation, 
      have risen an order of magnitude from the 1950s to the 1990s (see <a href="#figspm27">Figure 
      2-7</a>), and costs for non-catastrophic weather events have grown similarly. 
      The number of weather-related catastrophic events has risen three times 
      faster than the number of non-weather-related events, despite generally 
      enhanced disaster preparedness. Part of this observed upward trend in weather-related 
      losses over the past 50 years is linked to socio-economic factors (e.g., 
      population growth, increased wealth, urbanization in vulnerable areas), 
      and part is linked to regional climatic factors (e.g., changes in precipitation, 
      flooding events).<br>

      in Africa, and about 30% in Australia, Europe, and North and Central America. 
      The fraction covered is typically much higher when just storm losses are 
      considered, but flood-and crop-related losses have much lower coverage. 
      The balance of the losses are absorbed by governments and affected individuals

      </span>Many vector-, food-, and water-borne infectious diseases are known 
      to be sensitive to changes in climatic conditions. Extensive experience 
      makes clear that any increase in floods will increase the risk of drowning, 
      diarrheal and respiratory diseases, water-contamination diseases, and -- in 
      developing countries -- hunger and malnutrition (<em>high confidence</em>). 
      Heat waves in Europe and North America are associated with a significant 
      increase in urban mortality, but warmer wintertime temperatures also result 
      in reduced wintertime mortality. In some cases health effects are clearly 
      related to recent climate changes, such as in Sweden where tick-borne encephalitis 
      incidence increased after milder winters and moved northward following the 
      increased frequency of milder winters over the years 1980 to 1994. <br>

      <strong>Figure 2-7: The economic losses from catastrophic weather events 
      have risen globally 10-fold (inflation-adjusted) from the 1950s to the 1990s, 
      much faster than can be accounted for with simple inflation.</strong> The 
      insured portion of these losses rose from a negligible level to about 23% 
      in the 1990s. The total losses from small, non-catastrophic weather-related 
      events (not included here) are similar. Part of this observed upward trend 
      in weather-related disaster losses over the past 50 years is linked to socio-economic 
      factors (e.g., population growth, increased wealth, urbanization in vulnerable 
      areas), and part is linked to regional climatic factors (e.g., changes in
