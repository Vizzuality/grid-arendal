      <p>The climatic, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of greenhouse

        scenarios considered are scenarios that would achieve stabilization of 
        CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere. The role of adaptation 
        as a complement to mitigation and the potential contributions of reducing

        by historic, current, and future emissions. Estimates have been made of 
        the global mean temperature and sea-level rise effects of a 2% per year 
        reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by developed countries over the 
        period 2000 to 2100, assuming that developing countries do not reduce 
        their emissions.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnsyn.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
        Under these assumptions, global emissions and the atmospheric concentration 
        of CO<sub>2</sub> grow throughout the century but at a diminished rate 
        compared to scenarios that assume no actions to reduce developed country 
        emissions. The effects of the emission limit accrue slowly but build with 
        time. By the year 2030, the projected concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        in the atmosphere is reduced roughly 20% relative to the IS92a scenario 
        of unabated emissions, which diminishes warming and sea-level rise by 
        a small amount within this time frame. By the year 2100, the projected 
        CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is reduced by 35% relative to the IS92a scenario, 
        projected global mean warming reduced by 25%, and projected sea-level 
        rise reduced by 20%. Analyses of CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions of 
        1% per year by developed countries indicate that the lesser reductions 
        would yield smaller reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, temperature 
        change, and sea-level rise. Actions such as these taken now would have 
        a greater effect at the year 2100 than the same emissions reductions implemented 
        at a later time.<br>

        gas, carbon cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades, 
        about a century, or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease 
        steadily thereafter (see <a href="#figspm61">Figure 6-1</a>). 
        These models illustrate that emissions would peak in about 1 to 2 decades 
        (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm) from the present (see <a href="048.htm#tab6-1">Table 
        6-1</a>). Eventually CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would need to decline to 
        a very small fraction of current emissions. The benefits of different

        these stabilization levels are discussed in <a href="051.htm">Question

      <p><b><a name="figspm61"></a>Figure 6-1: Stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentrations would require substantial reductions of emissions below 
        current levels and would slow the rate of warming.</b></p>
      <p><b>a) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:</b> The time paths of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions that would lead to stabilization of the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        in the atmosphere at 450, 550, 650, 750, and 1,000 ppm are estimated for 
        the WRE stabilization profiles using carbon cycle models. Lower CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentration levels would require an earlier reversal of emissions growth 
        and earlier decreases to levels below current emissions. The shaded area 
        illustrates the range of uncertainty in estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        corresponding to specified concentration time paths, as represented in 
        carbon cycle models. Also shown for comparison are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        for three of the SRES scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1), which do not include 
        greenhouse gas emission limits.</p>
      <p> <b>b) CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations: </b>The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
        specified for the WRE profiles gradually approach stabilized levels that 
        range from 450 to 1,000 ppm. Also shown for comparison are estimates of 
        CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations that would result from three of the SRES 
        projections of emissions (A1B, A2, and B1). </p>
      <p><b>c) Global mean temperature changes:</b> Global mean temperature changes 
        are estimated for the WRE stabilization profiles using a simple climate 
        model tuned in turn to each of several more complex models.Estimated warming 
        slows as growth in the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> slows 
        and warming continues after the time at which the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
        is stabilized (indicated by black spots) but at a much diminished rate. 
        It is assumed that emissions of gases other than CO<sub>2</sub> follow 
        the SRES A1B projection until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter.This 
        scenario was chosen as it is in the middle of the range of the SRES scenarios. 
        The dashed lines show the temperature changes projected for the S profiles, 
        an alternate set of CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization profiles (not shown in 
        panels (a) or (b)). The shaded area illustrates the effect of a range 
        of climate sensitivity across the five stabilization cases.The colored 
        bars on the righthand side show, for each WRE profile, the range at the 
        year 2300 due to the different climate model tunings and the diamonds 
        on the righthand side show the equilibrium (very long-term) warming for 
        each stabilization level using average climate model results. Also shown 
        for comparison are temperature increases in the year 2100 estimated for 
        the SRES emission scenarios (indicated by red crosses).</p></td>
