<i>Globally averaged water vapour, evaporation and precipitation are projected 
to increase. At the regional scale both increases and decreases in precipitation 
are seen.</i> Results (see <a href="#figTechSum23">Figure 23</a>) from recent 
AOGCM simulations forced with SRES <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a> and <a href="099.htm#storyb2">B2</a> 
emissions scenarios indicate that it is likely for precipitation to increase in 
both summer and winter over high-latitude regions. In winter, increases are also 
seen over northern mid-latitudes, tropical Africa and Antarctica, and in summer 
in southern and eastern Asia. Australia, central America, and southern Africa 
show consistent decreases in winter rainfall.<br>
<p><i>Based on patterns emerging from a limited number of studies with current 
  AOGCMs, older GCMs, and regionalisation studies, there is a strong correlation 
  between precipitation interannual variability and mean precipitation.</i> Future 
  increases in mean precipitation will likely lead to increases in variability. 
  Conversely, precipitation variability will likely decrease only in areas of 
  reduced mean precipitation.<a name="f5"></a></p>
<h2>F.5 Projections of Future Changes in Extreme Events</h2>
<i>It is only recently that changes in extremes of weather and climate observed 
to date have been compared to changes projected by models (<a href="#tabTechSum4">Table 
4</a>).</i> More hot days and heat waves are very likely over nearly all land 
areas. These increases are projected to be largest mainly in areas where soil 
moisture decreases occur. Increases in daily minimum temperature are projected 
to occur over nearly all land areas and are generally larger where snow and ice 
retreat. Frost days and cold waves are very likely to become fewer. The changes 
in surface air temperature and surface absolute humidity are projected to result 
in increases in the heat index (which is a measure of the combined effects of 
temperature and moisture). The increases in surface air temperature are also projected 
to result in an increase in the "cooling degree days" (which is a measure 
of the amount of cooling required on a given day once the temperature exceeds 
a given threshold) and a decrease in "heating degree days". Precipitation 
extremes are projected to increase more than the mean and the intensity of precipitation 
events are projected to increase. The frequency of extreme precipitation events 
is projected to increase almost everywhere. There is projected to be a general 
drying of the mid-continental areas during summer. This is ascribed to a combination 
of increased temperature and potential evaporation that is not balanced by increases 
of precipitation. There is little agreement yet among models concerning future 
changes in mid-latitude storm intensity, frequency, and variability. There is 
little consistent evidence that shows changes in the projected frequency of tropical 
cyclones and areas of formation. However, some measures of intensities show projected 
increases, and some theoretical and modelling studies suggest that the upper limit 
of these intensities could increase. Mean and peak precipitation intensities from 
tropical cyclones are likely to increase appreciably. <br>
<p><i>For some other extreme phenomena, many of which may have important impacts 
  on the environment and society, there is currently insufficient information 
  to assess recent trends, and confidence in models and understanding is inadequate 
  to make firm projections.</i> In particular, very small-scale phenomena such 
  as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, and lightning are not simulated in global 
  models. Insufficient analysis has occurred of how extra-tropical cyclones may 
  change.</p>
