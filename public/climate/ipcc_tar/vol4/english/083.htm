<h2>B.2 Observed Changes in Precipitation and Atmospheric Moisture</h2>
<i>Since the time of the SAR, annual land precipitation has continued to increase 
in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (very likely to be 
0.5 to 1%/decade), except over Eastern Asia.</i> Over the sub-tropics (10&deg;N 
to 30&deg;N), land-surface rainfall has decreased on average (likely to be about 
0.3%/decade), although this has shown signs of recovery in recent years. Tropical 
land-surface precipitation measurements indicate that precipitation likely has 
increased by about 0.2 to 0.3%/ decade over the 20th century, but increases are 
not evident over the past few decades and the amount of tropical land (versus 
ocean) area for the latitudes 10&deg;N to 10&deg;S is relatively small. Nonetheless, 
direct measurements of precipitation and model reanalyses of inferred precipitation 
indicate that rainfall has also increased over large parts of the tropical oceans. 
Where and when available, changes in annual streamflow often relate well to changes 
in total precipitation. The increases in precipitation over Northern Hemisphere 
mid- and high latitude land areas have a strong correlation to long-term increases 
in total cloud amount. In contrast to the Northern Hemisphere, no comparable systematic 
changes in precipitation have been detected in broad latitudinal averages over 
the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
<p><i>It is likely that total atmospheric water vapour has increased several per 
  cent per decade over many regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</i> Changes in 
  water vapour over approximately the past 25 years have been analysed for selected 
  regions using in situ surface observations, as well as lower-tropospheric measurements 
  from satellites and weather balloons. A pattern of overall surface and lower-tropospheric 
  water vapour increases over the past few decades is emerging from the most reliable 
  data sets, although there are likely to be time-dependent biases in these data 
  and regional variations in the trends. Water vapour in the lower stratosphere 
  is also likely to have increased by about 10% per decade since the beginning 
  of the observational record (1980).</p>
<p><i>Changes in total cloud amounts over Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitude 
  continental regions indicate a likely increase in cloud cover of about 2% since 
  the beginning of the 20th century, which has now been shown to be positively 
  correlated with decreases in the diurnal temperature range.</i> Similar changes 
  have been shown over Australia, the only Southern Hemisphere continent where 
  such an analysis has been completed. Changes in total cloud amount are uncertain 
  both over sub-tropical and tropical land areas, as well as over the oceans.</p>
<a name="b3"></a>
<h2>B.3 Observed Changes in Snow Cover and Land- and Sea-Ice Extent</h2>
<i>Decreasing snow cover and land-ice extent continue to be positively correlated 
with increasing land-surface temperatures.</i> Satellite data show that there 
are very likely to have been decreases of about 10% in the extent of snow cover 
since the late 1960s. There is a highly significant correlation between increases 
in Northern Hemisphere land temperatures and the decreases. There is now ample 
evidence to support a major retreat of alpine and continental glaciers in response 
to 20th century warming. In a few maritime regions, increases in precipitation 
due to regional atmospheric circulation changes have overshadowed increases in 
temperature in the past two decades, and glaciers have re-advanced. Over the past 
100 to 150 years, ground-based observations show that there is very likely to 
have been a reduction of about two weeks in the annual duration of lake and river 
ice in the mid- to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.<br>
<p><i>Northern Hemisphere sea-ice amounts are decreasing, but no significant trends 
  in Antarctic sea-ice extent are apparent.</i> A retreat of sea-ice extent in 
  the Arctic spring and summer of 10 to 15% since the 1950s is consistent with 
  an increase in spring temperatures and, to a lesser extent, summer temperatures 
  in the high latitudes. There is little indication of reduced Arctic sea-ice 
  extent during winter when temperatures have increased in the surrounding region. 
  By contrast, there is no readily apparent relationship between decadal changes 
  of Antarctic temperatures and sea-ice extent since 1973. After an initial decrease 
  in the mid-1970s, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained stable, or even slightly 
  increased.</p>

  influencing these changes.</p>

<h2>B.4 Observed Changes in Sea Level</h2>
<a name="instrumental"></a>
<h3>Changes during the instrumental record</h3>
  
<i>Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global mean sea level rise during the 
20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a central value of 1.5 mm/yr 
(the central value should not be interpreted as a best estimate). </i>(See <a href="#box2">Box 
2</a> for the factors that influence sea level.) As <a href="#figTechSum6">Figure 
6</a> indicates, the longest instrumental records (two or three centuries at most) 
of local sea level come from tide gauges. Based on the very few long tide-gauge 
records, the average rate of sea level rise has been larger during the 20th century 
than during the 19th century. No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level 
rise during the 20th century has been detected. This is not inconsistent with 
model results due to the possibility of compensating factors and the limited data. 
<a name="pre-instrumental"></a> 
<h3>Changes during the pre-instrumental record</h3>
  
<i>Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the sea level in locations 
far from present and former ice sheets has risen by over 120 m as a result of 
loss of mass from these ice sheets.</i> Vertical land movements, both upward and 
downward, are still occurring in response to these large transfers of mass from 
ice sheets to oceans. The most rapid rise in global sea level was between 15,000 
and 6,000 years ago, with an average rate of about 10 mm/yr. Based on geological 
data, eustatic sea level (i.e., corresponding to a change in ocean volume) may 
have risen at an average rate of 0.5 mm/yr over the past 6,000 years and at an 
average rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last 3,000 years. This rate is about 
one tenth of that occurring during the 20th century. Over the past 3,000 to 5,000 
years, oscillations in global sea level on time-scales of 100 to 1,000 years are 
unlikely to have exceeded 0.3 to 0.5 m.<br>

    <td class="box"> 
      <p><b>Box 2: What causes sea level to change?</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>The level of the sea at the shoreline is determined by many factors in 
        the global environment that operate on a great range of time-scales, from 
        hours (tidal) to millions of years (ocean basin changes due to tectonics 
        and sedimentation). On the time-scale of decades to centuries, some of 
        the largest influences on the average levels of the sea are linked to 
        climate and climate change processes.</p>
      <p>Firstly, as ocean water warms, it expands. On the basis of observations 
        of ocean temperatures and model results, thermal expansion is believed 
        to be one of the major contributors to historical sea level changes. Further, 
        thermal expansion is expected to contribute the largest component to sea 
        level rise over the next hundred years. Deep ocean temperatures change 
        only slowly; therefore, thermal expansion would continue for many centuries 
        even if the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases were to stabilise.</p>
      <p>The amount of warming and the depth of water affected vary with location. 
        In addition, warmer water expands more than colder water for a given change 
        in temperature. The geographical distribution of sea level change results 
        from the geographical variation of thermal expansion, changes in salinity, 
        winds, and ocean circulation. The range of regional variation is substantial 
        compared with the global average sea level rise.</p>
      <p>Sea level also changes when the mass of water in the ocean increases or 
        decreases. This occurs when ocean water is exchanged with the water stored 
        on land. The major land store is the water frozen in glaciers or ice sheets. 
        Indeed, the main reason for the lower sea level during the last glacial 
        period was the amount of water stored in the large extension of the ice 
        sheets on the continents of the Northern Hemisphere. After thermal expansion, 
        the melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps is expected to make the 
        largest contribution to the rise of sea level over the next hundred years. 
        These glaciers and ice caps make up only a few per cent of the world's 
        land-ice area, but they are more sensitive to climate change than the 
        larger ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, because the ice sheets 
        are in colder climates with low precipitation and low melting rates. Consequently, 
        the large ice sheets are expected to make only a small net contribution 
        to sea level change in the coming decades.</p>
      <p>Sea level is also influenced by processes that are not explicitly related 
        to climate change. Terrestrial water storage (and hence, sea level) can 
        be altered by extraction of ground water, building of reservoirs, changes 
        in surface runoff, and seepage into deep aquifers from reservoirs and 
        irrigation. These factors may be offsetting a significant fraction of 
        the expected acceleration in sea level rise from thermal expansion and 
        glacial melting. In addition, coastal subsidence in river delta regions 
        can also influence local sea level. Vertical land movements caused by 
        natural geological processes, such as slow movements in the Earth's 
        mantle and tectonic displacements of the crust, can have effects on local 
        sea level that are comparable to climate-related impacts. Lastly, on seasonal, 
        interannual, and decadal time-scales, sea level responds to changes in 
        atmospheric and ocean dynamics, with the most striking example occurring 
        during El Ni&ntilde;o events.</p>
