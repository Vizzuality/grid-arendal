      concentrations of greenhouse gases will result in changes in daily, seasonal, 
      inter-annual, and decadal variability.</span> There is projected to be a 
      decrease in diurnal temperature range in many areas, with nighttime lows 
      increasing more than daytime highs. A number of models show a general decrease 
      of daily variability of surface air temperature in winter and increased 
      daily variability in summer in the Northern Hemisphere land areas. Current 
      projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude for El Ni&ntilde;o 
      events over the next 100 years. Many models show a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
      mean response in the tropical Pacific, with the central and eastern equatorial 
      Pacific sea surface temperatures projected to warm more than the western 
      equatorial Pacific and with a corresponding mean eastward shift of precipitation. 
      Even with little or no change in El Ni&ntilde;o strength, global warming
      is
      likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase
      the risk of droughts and floods that occur with El Ni&ntilde;o events in 
      many different regions. There is no clear agreement between models concerning 
      the changes in frequency or structure of other naturally occurring atmosphere-ocean 
    circulation pattern such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).<br>    <br> </td>

      of surface air temperature in winter and increased daily variability in 
      summer in Northern Hemisphere land areas. The changes in temperature extremes 
      are likely to result in increased crop and livestock losses, higher energy 
      use for cooling and lower for heating, and increased human morbidity and 
      heat-stress-related mortality (see <a href="038.htm">Table 
      4-1</a>). Fewer frost days will result in decreased cold-related human morbidity 
      and mortality, and decreased risk of damage to a number of crops, though 
      the risk to other crops may increase. Benefits to agriculture from a small 
      temperature increase could result in small increases in the GDP of temperate

      property
      damage, loss to infrastructure and settlements, soil erosion, pollution
      loads, insurance and agriculture losses, amongst others. A general drying
      of the mid-continental areas during summer is likely to lead to increases
      in summer droughts and could increase the risk of wild fires. This general
      drying is due to a combination of increased temperature and potential
      evaporation that is not balanced by increases in precipitation. It is likely
      that global warming will lead to an increase in the variability of Asian
