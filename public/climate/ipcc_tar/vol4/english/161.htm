<h1>The Costs and Ancillary<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> Benefits of Mitigation Actions <br>
</h1>
<p> <a name="11"></a>11.<i> Estimates of cost and benefits of mitigation actions 
  differ because of (i) how welfare is measured, (ii) the scope and methodology 
  of the analysis, and (iii) the underlying assumptions built into the analysis. 
  As a result, estimated costs and benefits may not reflect the actual costs and 
  benefits of implementing mitigation actions</i>. With respect to (i) and (ii), 
  costs and benefits estimates,<i> inter alia</i>, depend on revenue recycling, 
  and whether and how the following are considered: implementation and transaction 
  cost, distributional impacts, multiple gases, land-use change options, benefits 
  of avoided climate change, ancillary benefits, no regrets opportunities<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  and valuation of externalities and non-market impacts. Assumptions include,<i> 
  inter alia</i>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demographic change, the rate and structure of economic growth; increases 
    in personal mobility, technological innovation such as improvements in energy 
    efficiency and the availability of low-cost energy sources, flexibility of 
    capital investments and labour markets, prices, fiscal distortions in the 
    no-policy (baseline) scenario.</li>
  <li>The level and timing of the mitigation target.</li>
  <li>Assumptions regarding implementation measures, e.g. the extent of emissions 
    trading, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), 
    regulation, and voluntary agreements <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>11</sup></small></a> 
    and the associated transaction costs. </li>
  <li>Discount rates: the long time scales make discounting assumptions critical 
    and there is still no consensus on appropriate long-term rates, though the 
    literature shows increasing attention to rates that decline over time and 
    hence give more weight to benefits that occur in the long term. These discount 
    rates should be distinguished from the higher rates that private agents generally 
    use in market transactions.<br>
    (Sections  <a href="../../wg3/271.htm">7.2</a>,  <a href="../../wg3/283.htm">7.3</a>, 
     <a href="../../wg3/322.htm#821">8.2.1</a>, <a href="../../wg3/326.htm">8.2.2</a>, 
     <a href="../../wg3/374.htm">9.4</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="12"></a>12.<i> Some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited 
  at no or negative net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no 
  regrets opportunities </i>(Sections  <a href="../../wg3/291.htm">7.3.4</a>, <a href="../../wg3/356.htm#921">9.2.1</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Market imperfections</i>. Reduction of existing market or institutional 
    failures and other barriers that impede adoption of cost-effective emission 
    reduction measures, can lower private costs compared to current practice. 
    This can also reduce private costs overall.</li>
  <li><i>Ancillary benefits</i>. Climate change mitigation measures will have 
    effects on other societal issues. For example, reducing carbon emissions in 
    many cases will result in the simultaneous reduction in local and regional 
    air pollution. It is likely that mitigation strategies will also affect transportation, 
    agriculture, land-use practices and waste management and will have an impact 
    on other issues of social concern, such as employment, and energy security. 
    However, not all of the effects will be positive; careful policy selection 
    and design can better ensure positive effects and minimize negative impacts. 
    In some cases, the magnitude of ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable 
    to the costs of the mitigating measures, adding to the no regrets potential, 
    although estimates are difficult to make and vary widely (Sections <a href="../../wg3/288.htm">7.3.3</a>, 
    <a href="../../wg3/334.htm">8.2.4</a>, <a href="../../wg3/359.htm">9.2.2</a>- 
    <a href="../../wg3/368.htm#928">9.2.8</a>, <a href="../../wg3/371.htm">9.2.10</a>).</li>
  <li> <i>Double dividend</i>. Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned permits) 
    provide revenues to the government. If used to finance reductions in existing 
    distortionary taxes ("revenue recycling"), these revenues reduce 
    the economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions. The magnitude of 
    this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of tax cuts, labour 
    market conditions, and method of recycling. Under some circumstances, it is 
    possible that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of mitigation (Sections 
    <a href="../../wg3/288.htm">7.3.3</a>, 
    <a href="../../wg3/326.htm">8.2.2</a>, 
    <a href="../../wg3/356.htm#921">9.2.1</a>)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> <a name="13"></a>13. <i>The cost estimates for Annex B countries to implement 
  the Kyoto Protocol vary between studies and regions as indicated in <a href="161.htm">Paragraph 
  11</a>, and depend strongly upon the assumptions regarding the use of the Kyoto 
  mechanisms, and their interactions with domestic measures</i>. The great majority 
  of global studies reporting and comparing these costs use international energy-economic 
  models. Nine of these studies suggest the following GDP impacts <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a> 
  (Sections  <a href="../../wg3/293.htm">7.3.5</a>,  <a href="../../wg3/341.htm">8.3.1</a>, 
   <a href="../../wg3/360.htm">9.2.3</a>,  <a href="../../wg3/441.htm">10.4.4</a>): </p>
<p><i>Annex II countries<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>13</sup></small></a> 
  : In the absence of emissions trading between Annex B countries<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a>, 
  the majority of global studies show reductions in projected GDP of about 0.2% 
  to 2% in 2010 for different Annex II regions. With full emissions trading between 
  Annex B countries, the estimated reductions in 2010 are between 0.1% and 1.1% 
  of projected GDP</i><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>15</sup></small></a>. 
  These studies encompass a wide range of assumptions as listed in Paragraph 11. 
  Models whose results are reported in this paragraph assume full use of emissions 
  trading without transaction cost. Results for cases that do not allow Annex 
  B trading assume full domestic trading within each region. Models do not include 
  sinks or non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases. They do not include the CDM, negative 
  cost options, ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling.<br>
  <br>
  For all regions costs are also influenced by the following factors: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Constraints on the use of Annex B trading, high transaction costs in implementing 
    the mechanisms, and inefficient domestic implementation could raise costs. 
  </li>
  <li>Inclusion in domestic policy and measures of the no regrets possibilities<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
    identified in <a href="161.htm#12">Paragraph 12</a>, use of the CDM, sinks, 
    and inclusion of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases, could lower costs. Costs 
    for individual countries can vary more widely.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The models show that the Kyoto mechanisms are important in controlling risks 
  of high costs in given countries, and thus can complement domestic policy mechanisms. 
  Similarly, they can minimize risks of inequitable international impacts and 
  help to level marginal costs. The global modelling studies reported above show 
  national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets from about US$20/tC up to 
  US$600/tC without trading, and a range from about US$15/tC up to US$150/tC with 
  Annex B trading. The cost reductions from these mechanisms may depend on the 
  details of implementation, including the compatibility of domestic and international 
  mechanisms, constraints, and transaction costs.</p>
<p>This reflects opportunities for energy efficiency improvements not 
  available to Annex II countries. Under assumptions of drastic energy efficiency 
  improvement and/or continuing economic recessions in some countries, the assigned 
  amounts may exceed projected emissions in the first commitment period. In this 
  case, models show increased GDP due to revenues from trading assigned amounts. 
  However, for some economies in transition, implementing the Kyoto Protocol will 
  have similar impact on GDP as for Annex II countries.</p>
<p><a name="14"></a>14.<i> Cost-effectiveness studies with a century timescale 
  estimate that the costs of stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the 
  atmosphere increase as the concentration stabilization level declines. Different 
  baselines can have a strong influence on absolute costs</i>. While there is 
  a moderate increase in the costs when passing from a 750ppmv to a 550ppmv concentration 
  stabilization level, there is a larger increase in costs passing from 550ppmv 
  to 450ppmv unless the emissions in the baseline scenario are very low. These 
  results, however, do not incorporate carbon sequestration, gases other than 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and did not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets 
  on induced technological change <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>. 
  Costs associated with each concentration level depend on numerous factors including 
  the rate of discount, distribution of emission reductions over time, policies 
  and measures employed, and particularly the choice of the baseline scenario: 
  for scenarios characterized by a focus on local and regional sustainable development 
  for example, total costs of stabilizing at a particular level are significantly 
  lower than for other scenarios<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a> 
  (Sections <a href="../../wg3/082.htm#252">2.5.2</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg3/346.htm#841">8.4.1</a>, 
   <a href="../../wg3/448.htm">10.4.6</a>).</p>
<p><a name="15"></a>15.<i> Under any greenhouse gas mitigation effort, the economic 
  costs and benefits are distributed unevenly between sectors; to a varying degree, 
  the costs of mitigation actions could be reduced by appropriate policies</i>. 
  In general, it is easier to identify activities, which stand to suffer economic 
  costs compared to those which may benefit, and the economic costs are more immediate, 
  more concentrated and more certain. Under mitigation policies, coal, possibly 
  oil and gas, and certain energy-intensive sectors, such as steel production, 
  are most likely to suffer an economic disadvantage. Other industries including 
  renewable energy industries and services can be expected to benefit in the long 
  term from price changes and the availability of financial and other resources 
  that would otherwise have been devoted to carbon-intensive sectors. Policies 
  such as the removal of subsidies from fossil fuels may increase total societal 
  benefits through gains in economic efficiency, while use of the Kyoto mechanisms 
  could be expected to reduce the net economic cost of meeting Annex B targets. 
  Other types of policies, for example exempting carbon-intensive industries, 
  redistribute the costs but increase total societal costs at the same time. Most 
  studies show that the distributional effects of a carbon tax can have negative 
  income effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues are used directly 
  or indirectly to compensate such effects (Section <a href="../../wg3/356.htm#921">9.2.1</a>).</p>
<p><a name="16"></a>16. <i>Emission constraints in Annex I countries have well 
  established, albeit varied "spillover" effects <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>18</sup></small></a> 
  on non-Annex I countries</i> (Sections  <a href="../../wg3/343.htm">8.3.2</a>,  <a href="../../wg3/373.htm">9.3</a>).<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries: Analyses report costs differently, 
    including, inter alia, reductions in projected GDP and reductions in projected 
    oil revenues</i> <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>19</sup></small></a>. 
    The study reporting the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of projected 
    GDP with no emissions trading, and less than 0.05% of projected GDP with Annex 
    B emissions trading in 2010 <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>20</sup></small></a>. 
    The study reporting the highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected 
    oil revenues with no emissions trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues 
    with Annex B emissions trading in 2010. These studies do not consider policies 
    and measures <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>21</sup></small></a> 
    other than Annex B emissions trading, that could lessen the impact on non-Annex 
    I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the costs 
    to these countries and overall costs. </li>
</ul>
<p>The effects on these countries can be further reduced by removal of subsidies 
  for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content, increased 
  use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-exporting 
  countries.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected by reductions 
    in demand for their exports to OECD nations and by the price increase of those 
    carbon-intensive and other products they continue to import. These countries 
    may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive 
    products and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how</i>. 
    The net balance for a given country depends on which of these factors dominates. 
    Because of these complexities, the breakdown of winners and losers remains 
    uncertain. </li>
  <li><i>Carbon leakage <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>22</sup></small></a>. 
    The possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-Annex I 
    countries and wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices 
    may lead to leakage in the order of 5%-20% </i>(Section  <a href="../../wg3/344.htm#8322">8.3.2.2</a>). 
    Exemptions, for example for energy-intensive industries, make the higher model 
    estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate costs. The 
    transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, not included 
    in models, may lead to lower leakage and especially on the longer term may 
    more than offset the leakage.</li>
