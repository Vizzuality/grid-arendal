      to decision criteria for the selection and timing of specific adaptation 
      measures.</span> The costs of measures to protect coastal areas from sea-level 
      rise are perhaps the best studied to date. Evaluated measures include construction 
      of "hard structures" such as dikes, levees, and seawalls, and 
      the use of "soft structures" such as nourishment of beaches with 
      sand and dune restoration. Estimates of the costs of protecting coasts vary 
      depending on assumptions about what decisions will be made regarding the 
      extent of the coastline to be protected, the types of structures to be used, 
      the timing of their implementation (which is influenced by the rate of sea-level 
      rise), and discount rates. Different assumptions about these factors yield 
      estimates for protection of U.S. coasts from 0.5-m sea-level rise by the 
      year 2100 that range from US$20 billion to US$150 billion in present value.<br>

      populations in developing countries are generally expected to be exposed 
      to relatively high risks of adverse impacts from climate change on human 
      health, water supplies, agricultural productivity, property, and other resources.

      natural resource base, misplaced incentives, inadequate legal framework, 
      and struggling public and private institutions create conditions of low

      cultivation and grazing practices that fail to protect soils from degradation, 
      and pollution of air and water can reduce the robustness of systems to cope 
      with variations or change in climate, and the resilience of systems to recover 
      from declines. Such pressures make systems, and the populations that derive 
      goods, services, and livelihoods from them, highly vulnerable to climate 
      change. These pressures are present in developed as well as developing countries, 
      but satisfying development goals in ways that do not place non-sustainable 
      pressures on systems pose a particular dilemma for developing countries.<br>

      destruction from which can set back development efforts by years in some 
      instances. Advances in health and nutritional status could be set back in 
      some areas by climate change impacts on human health and agriculture. Hazards 
      such as these can also be exacerbated by further development in inherently

      agricultural lands, and forests. The performance of these projects can be 
      affected by climate change and increased climate variability, yet these 
      factors are given little consideration in the design of projects. Analyses 
      have shown that flexibility to perform well under a wider range of climate 
      conditions can be built into projects at modest incremental costs in some 
      instances, and that greater flexibility has immediate value because of risks 
      from present climate variability.<br> <br> </td>

      and lowering inequities in access, reducing poverty, improving education 
      and training, investing in infrastructure, involving concerned parties in 
      managing local resources, and raising institutional capacities and efficiencies. 
      Additionally, initiatives to slow habitat conversion, manage harvesting 
      practices to better protect the resource, adopt cultivation and grazing 
      practices that protect soils, and better regulate the discharge of pollutants 
      can reduce vulnerabilities to climate change while moving toward more sustainable
