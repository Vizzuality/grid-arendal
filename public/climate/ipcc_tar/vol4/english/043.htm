      <b><a name="figspm53"></a>Figure 5-3: Stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
      at current levels will result in a continously rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
      concentration and temperature.</b> Stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
      and temperature change will eventually require the emissions to drop well 
      below current levels. In all three panels the red curves illustrate the 
      result of emissions held constant at the level prescribed by the WRE 550 
      profile for the year 2000 (which is slightly higher than the actual emissions 
      for the year 2000), while the blue curves are the result of emissions following 
      the WRE 550 stabilization profile. Both cases are illustrative only: Constant 
      global emissions are unrealistic in the short term, and no preference is 
      expressed for the WRE 550 profile over others. Other stabilization profiles 
      are illustrated in <a href="047.htm#figspm61">Figure 6-1</a>. Figure 5-3

      and biodiversity maintenance on a sustainable basis may not be immediately

      the importance of the change until the already established individuals die 
      or are killed in a disturbance. For example, for climate change of the degree 
      possible within the 21st century, it is likely, in some forests, that when 
      a stand is disturbed by fire, wind, pests, or harvesting, instead of the 
      community regenerating as in the past, species may be lost or replaced by

      Climatic changes in the next 100 years are expected to exceed any experienced
      by human societies over at least the past 5 millennia. The magnitude and
      rate of these changes will pose a major challenge for humanity. The time
      needed for socio-economic adaptation varies from years to decades, depending
      on the sector and the resources available to assist the transition. There
      is inertia in decision making in the area of adaptation and mitigation,
      and in implementing those decisions, on the order of decades. The fact
      that
      adaptation and mitigation decisions are generally not made by the same
      entities compounds the difficulties inherent in the identification and
      implementation
      of the best possible combination of strategies, and hence contributes to
      the delays of climate change response.<br>

      of years to decades between perceiving a need to respond to a major challenge, 
      planning,researching and developing a solution, and implementing it.</span>Thisdelaycan 
      be shortened by anticipating need sthrough the application of foresight, 
      and thus developing technologies in advance. The response of technological 
      development to energy price changes has historically been relatively rapid 
      (typically, less than 5 years elapses between a price shock and the response 
      in terms of patenting activity and introduction of new model offerings) 
      but its diffusion takes much longer. The diffusion rate often depends on 
      the rate of retirement of previously installed equipment. Early deployment 
      of rapidly improving technologies allows learning-curve cost reductions 
      (learning by doing), without premature lock-in to existing, low-efficiency 
      technology. The rate of technology diffusion is strongly dependent not only 
      on economic feasibility but also on socio-economic pressures. For some technologies, 
      such as the adoption of new crop varieties, the availability of, and information 
      on, pre-existing adaptation options allows for rapid adaptation. In many 
      regions, however, population pressures on limited land and water resources, 
      government policies impeding change, or limited access to information or 
      financial resources make adaptation difficult and slow. Optimal adaptation 
      to climate change trends, such as more frequent droughts, may be delayed 
      if they are perceived to be due to natural variability, while they might 
      actually be related to climate change. Conversely, maladaptation can occur 
      if climate variability is mistaken for a trend.</td>
