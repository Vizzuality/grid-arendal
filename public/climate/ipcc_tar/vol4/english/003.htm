<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established 
  in 1988, by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations 
  Environment Programme (UNEP). Its present terms of reference are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess available information on the science, the impacts, and the economics 
    of -- and the options for mitigating and/ or adapting to -- climate change.</li>
  <li>Provide, on request, scientific/technical/socio-economic advice to the Conference 
    of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
    Change (UNFCCC). </li>
</ul>
<p>Since its establishment, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports 
  (1990, 1995, and 2001), Special Reports, Technical Papers, and methodologies, 
  such as the <em>Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</em>, which 
  have become standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists, 
  and other experts and students.</p>
<p>This Synthesis Report completes the four-volume Third Assessment Report (TAR). 
  It addresses specifically the issues of concern to the policymaker, in the context 
  of Article 2 of the UNFCCC -- issues such as the extent to which human activities 
  have influenced and will in the future influence the global climate, the impacts 
  of a changed climate on ecological and socio-economic systems, and existing 
  and projected technical and policy capacity to address anthropogenic climate 
  change. It explores briefly the linked nature of a number of multilateral environmental 
  conventions. It draws on the work of hundreds of experts from all regions of 
  the world who have in the past and at present participated in the IPCC process. 
  As is customary in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended first 
  and foremost on the dedication, enthusiasm, and cooperation of these experts 
  in many different but related disciplines.</p>
<p>We take this opportunity to express our heart-felt gratitude to the authors 
  and reviewers of all the IPCC reports and Technical Papers, particularly the 
  TAR. We thank likewise the IPCC Bureau; Dr. Sundararaman, Secretary of IPCC, 
  and his Secretariat staff; and those staffing the Technical Support Units of 
  the three Working Groups. We acknowledge with gratitude the governments and 
  organizations that contribute to the IPCC Trust Fund, and provide support to 
  the experts and in other ways. The IPCC has been especially successful in engaging 
  in its work a large number of experts from the developing countries and countries 
  with their economies in transition; the Trust Fund enables extending financial 
  assistance for their travel to IPCC meetings.</p>
<p>We thank the Chairman of the IPCC, Dr. Robert T. Watson, for guiding the effort 
  in completing the TAR.</p>
