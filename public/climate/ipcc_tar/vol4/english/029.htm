      <b><a name="figspm33"></a></b><strong>Figure 3-3:The background 
      shows the annual mean change of rainfall (color shading) for (a) the SRES 
      scenario A2 and (b) the SRES scenario B2.</strong> Both SRES scenarios show 
      the period 2071 to 2100 relative to the period 1961 to 1990, and were performed 
      by AOGCMs. Scenarios A2 and B2 are shown as no AOGCM runs were available 
      for the other SRES scenarios. The boxes show an analysis of inter-model 
      consistency in regional precipitation change. Regions are classified as 
      showing either agreement on increase with an average change of greater than 
      20% ( large increase), agreement on increase with an average change between 
      5 and 20% ( small increase), agreement on a change between -5 and +5% or 
      agreement with an average change between -5 and +5% ( no change), agreement 
      on decrease with an average change between -5 and -20% ( small decrease), 
      agreement on decrease with an average change of more than -20% ( large decrease), 
      or disagreement ( inconsistent sign). A consistent result from at least 
      seven of the nine models is defined as being necessary for agreement.<br>

      effects, but adverse effects are projected to predominate for much of the 
      world. The various effects of climate change pose risks that increase with 
      global mean temperature. Many of these risks have been organized into five 
      reasons for concern: threats to endangered species and unique systems, damages 
      from extreme climate events, effects that fall most heavily on developing 
      countries and the poor within countries, global aggregate impacts, and large-scale 
      high-impact events (see <a href="029.htm#box32">Box 3-2</a> 
      and <a href="027.htm#figspm31">Figure 3-1</a>). The effects 
      of climate change on human health, ecosystems, food production, water resources, 
      small islands and low-lying coastal regions, and aggregate market activities 
      are summarized below. However, note that future changes in the frequency 
      or intensity of extreme events have not been taken into account in most 
      of these studies (see also <a href="037.htm">Question 4</a>).<br>

          <td bgcolor="#B9CFE3"> <ul>
              <li><em>Unique and threatened systems:</em> Some changes in species 
                and systems have already been associated with observed changes 
                in climate, and some highly vulnerable species and systems may 
                be at risk of damage or even loss for very small changes in climate. 
                Greater warming would intensify the risks to these species and 
                systems, and place additional ones at risk.</li>
              <li><em>Extreme climate events:</em> Increased frequencies and intensities 
                of some extreme events have already been observed (see <a href="019.htm">Question 
                2</a>) and are likely to increase with further warming, as would 
                the risks to human life, property, crops, livestock, and ecosystems. 
                These risks increase where development is occurring in inherently 
                dynamic and unstable zones (e.g., river floodplains and low-lying 
                coastal regions) (see also <a href="037.htm">Question 
                4</a>).</li>
              <li><em>Uneven distribution of impacts:</em> In general, developing 
                countries are at greater risk of adverse impacts from climate 
                change than are developed countries, of which some of the latter 
                may experience market sector benefits for warming less than a 
                few &deg;C. For greater warming, most regions are at risk of predominantly 
                negative effects from climate change. But developing countries 
                generally would continue to be more severely impacted than developed 
                countries. Within countries, ulnerability varies and the poorest 
                populations often have higher exposure to impacts that threaten 
                their lives and livelihoods.</li>
              <li><em>Global aggregate impacts:</em> Globally aggregated market 
                sector impacts may be positive or negative up to a few &deg;C, 
                though the majority of people may be negatively affected. With 
                greater warming, the risk of negative global market sector impacts 
                increases, and impacts would be predominantly negative for most 
                people.</li>
              <li> <em>Large-scale, high-impact events:</em> The probability of 
                large-scale, high-impact events within a 100- year time horizon 
                such as shutdown of the thermohaline circulation or collapse of 
                the West Antarctic ice sheet is very low for warming less than 
                a few &deg;C. The risk, which is a product of the probabilities 
                of these events and the magnitude of their consequences, is largely 
                unquantified. For greater warming, and over a time horizon longer 
                than 100 years, the probabilities and the risks increase, but 
                by an amount that cannot now be estimated. See also <a href="037.htm">Question 
                4</a>.</li>
