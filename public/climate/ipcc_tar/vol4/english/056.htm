        suggest that a very significant reduction in world carbon emissions per 
        unit of GDP from year 1990 levels will be necessary. For the crucial energy 
        sector, almost all greenhouse gas mitigation and concentration stabilization 
        scenarios are characterized by the introduction of efficient technologies 
        for both energy use and supply, and of low- or no-carbon energy. However, 
        no single technology option will provide all of the emissions reductions 
        needed for stabilization. Reduction options in non-energy sources and 
        non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases will also provide significant potential 
        for reducing emissions.<br>

        since the SAR indicate that a gradual near-term transition from the world's 
        present energy system towards a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes 
        costs associated with premature retirement of existing capital stock. 
        It also provides time for investment in technology development and diffusion, 
        and may reduce the risk of lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing 
        low-emission technology. On the other hand, more rapid near-term action 
        would increase flexibility in moving towards stabilization, decrease environmental 
        and human risks associated with rapid climatic changes, while minimizing 
        potential implications of inertia in climate and ecological systems (see 
        <a href="041.htm">Question 5</a>). It may also stimulate more rapid deployment 
        of existing low-emission technologies and provide strong near-term incentives 
        to future technological changes that may help reduce the risks of lock-in 
        to carbon-intensive technologies. It also would give greater scope for 
        later tightening of targets should that be deemed desirable in light of 
        evolving scientific understanding.<br>

        century time scale estimate that the mitigation costs of stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentrations in the atmosphere increase as the concentration stabilization 
        level declines. Different baselines can have a strong influence on absolute 
        costs</span>. While there is a moderate increase in the costs when passing 
        from a 750 to a 550 ppmv concentration stabilization level, there is a 
        larger increase in costs passing from 550 to 450 ppmv (see <a href="#figspm73">Figure 
        7-3</a>) unless the emissions in the baseline scenario are very low (see 
        <a href="057.htm#figspm74">Figure 7-4</a>). Although model 
        projections indicate long-term global growth paths of GDP are not significantly 
        affected by mitigation actions towards stabilization, these do not show 
        the larger variations that occur over some shorter time periods, sectors, 
        or regions. These results, however, do not incorporate carbon sequestration, 
        and did not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced 
        technological change. Costs associated with each concentration level depend 
        on numerous factors including the rate of discount, distribution of emission 
        reductions over time, policies and measures employed, and particularly 
        the choice of the baseline scenario. For scenarios characterized by a 
        focus on local and regional sustainable development for example, total 
        costs of stabilizing at a particular level are significantly lower than 
        for other scenarios. Also, the issue of uncertainty takes on increasing
