      well-founded actions to adapt to or mitigate climate change are more effective, 
      and under some circumstances may be cheaper, if taken earlier rather than 
      later. </span>Time lags provide a breathing space between emissions and
      impacts, thus allowing time for planned adaptation. The inertia of technology
      development and capital stock replacement is an important argument for
      gradual
      mitigation. The essential point of inertia in economic structures and processes
      is that deviation from any given trend incurs costs, and these costs rise
      with the speed of deviations (e.g., the costs of early retirement of carbon-intensive
      facilities). Earlier mitigation action may reduce the
      risk of incurring severe lasting or irreversible impacts, while reducing
      the need for more rapid mitigation later.Accelerated action may help to
      drive down the costs of mitigation and adaptation in the long term by accelerating
      technology development and the early realization of benefits currently
      obscured
      by market imperfections. Abatement over the next few years is economically
      valuable if there is a significant probability of having to stay below
      ceilings
      that would otherwise be reached within the characteristic time scales of
      the systems producing greenhouse gases. Climate change mitigation decisions
      depend on the interplay of inertia and uncertainty, resulting in a sequential
      decision-making process. Foresight and early adaptation will be most advantageous
      in sectors with long-lived infrastructure, such as dams and bridges, and
      large social inertia, such as misallocated property rights. Anticipatory
      adaptive action can be very cost-effective if the anticipated trend materializes.<br>

      action or technology development can have different outcomes, depending

      effect of reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero in the 
      year 1995, on sea-level rise during the 21st century in the Pacific, showed 
      that the sea-level rise that would inevitably occur due to warming incurred 
      to 1995 (5 to 12 cm) would be substantially less than if the same emission 
      reduction occurred in the year 2020 (14 to 32 cm). This demonstrates the 
      increasing commitment to future sea-level rise due to past and present emissions, 
      and the effect of delaying the hypothetical emissions reduction.<br>

      inertia in less developed countries can be reduced through "leapfrogging" 
      (i.e., adopting anticipative strategies to avoid the problems faced today 
      by industrial societies). </span>It cannot be assumed that developing countries 
      will automatically follow the past development paths of industrialized countries. 
      For example, some developing countries have bypassed land-lines for communication, 
      and proceeded directly to mobile phones. Developing countries could avoid 
      the past energy-inefficient practices of developed countries by adopting 
      technologies that use energy in a more sustainable way, recycling more wastes 
      and products, and handling residual wastes in a more acceptable manner. 
      This may be easier to achieve in new infrastructure and energy systems in 
      developing countries since large investments are needed in any case. Transfer 
      of technology between countries and regions can reduce technological inertia.

        and socio-economic systems imply that safety margins should be considered 
        in setting strategies, targets, and time tables for avoiding dangerous 
        levels of interference in the climate system. </span>Stabilization target 
        levels of, for instance, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, temperature, 
        or sea level may be affected by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The inertia of the climate system, which will cause climate change 
          to continue for a period after mitigation actions are implemented</li>
        <li>Uncertainty regarding the location of possible thresholds of irreversible 
          change and the behavior of the system in their vicinity</li>
        <li>The time lags between adoption of mitigation goals and their achievement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Similarly, adaptation is affected by time lags involved in identifying
        climate change impacts, developing effective adaptation strategies, and
        implementing adaptive measures. Hedging strategies and sequential decision
        making (iterative action, assessment, and revised action) may be appropriate
        responses to the combination of inertia and uncertainty. Inertia has
        different consequences for adaptation than for mitigation, with adaptation
        being primarily oriented to address localized impacts of climate change,
        while mitigation aims to address the impacts on the climate system. Both
        issues involve time lags and inertia, with inertia suggesting a generally
        greater sense of urgency for mitigation.<br>
