<h2><a name="92"></a>9.2 Selected Specific Sectoral Findings on Costs of Climate 
  Change Mitigation</h2>
<h3><a name="921"></a>9.2.1 Coal</h3>
<p>Within this broad picture, certain sectors will be substantially affected by 
  mitigation. Relative to the reference case, the coal industry, producing the 
  most carbon-intensive of products, faces almost inevitable decline in the long 
  term, relative to the baseline projection. Technologies still under development, 
  such as CO<sub>2</sub> removal and storage from coal-burning plants and in-situ 
  gasification, could play a future role in maintaining the output of coal whilst 
  avoiding CO<sub>2</sub> and other emissions. Particularly large effects on the 
  coal sector are expected from policies such as the removal of fossil fuel subsidies 
  or the restructuring of energy taxes so as to tax the carbon content rather 
  than the energy content of fuels. It is a well-established finding that removal 
  of the subsidies would result in substantial reductions in GHG emissions, as 
  well as stimulating economic growth. However, the effects in specific countries 
  depend heavily on the type of subsidy removed and the commercial viability of 
  alternative energy sources, including imported coal.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="922"></a>9.2.2 Oil</h3>
<p>The oil industry also faces a potential relative decline, although this may 
  be moderated by lack of substitutes for oil in transportation, substitution 
  away from solid fuels towards liquid fuels in electricity generation, and the 
  diversification of the industry into energy supply in general. </p>
<p><a href="#tabTS6">Table TS.6</a> shows a number of model results for the impacts 
  of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol on oil exporting countries. Each model 
  uses a different measure of impact, and many use different groups of countries 
  in their definition of oil exporters. However, the studies all show that the 
  use of the flexibility mechanisms will reduce the economic cost to oil producers.</p>
<p>Thus, studies show a wide range of estimates for the impact of GHG mitigation 
  policies on oil production and revenue. Much of these differences are attributable 
  to the assumptions made about: the availability of conventional oil reserves, 
  the degree of mitigation required, the use of emission trading, control of GHGs 
  other than CO<sub>2</sub>, and the use of carbon sinks. However, all studies 
  show a net growth in both oil production and revenue to at least 2020, and significantly 
  less impact on the real price of oil than has resulted from market fluctuations 
  over the past 30 years. <a href="#figTS9">Figure TS.9</a> shows the projection 
  of real oil prices to 2010 from the IEA's 1998 World Energy Outlook, and 
  the effect of Kyoto implementation from the G-cubed model, the study which shows 
  the largest fall in Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) revenues 
  in Table TS.6. The 25% loss in OPEC revenues in the non-trading scenario implies 
  a 17% fall in oil prices shown for 2010 in the figure; this is reduced to a 
  fall of just over 7% with Annex I trading. <br>

<p>These studies typically do not consider some or all of the following policies 
  and measures that could lessen the impact on oil exporters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>policies and measures for non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs or non-energy sources 
    of all GHGs;</li>
  <li>offsets from sinks; </li>
  <li>industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier of energy 
    services); </li>
  <li>the use of OPEC's market power; and</li>
  <li>actions (e.g., of Annex B Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the 
    transfer of technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the studies typically do not include the following policies and 
  effects that can reduce the total cost of mitigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens or finance other mitigation 
    measures; </li>
  <li>environmental co- or ancillary benefits of reductions in fossil fuel use; 
    and</li>
  <li>induced technical change from mitigation policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the studies may tend to overstate both the costs to oil exporting 
  countries and overall costs.</p>

<h3><a name="figTS9"></a><a name="923"></a>9.2.3 Gas</h3>
<p>Modelling studies suggest that mitigation policies may have the least impact 
  on oil, the most impact on coal, with the impact on gas somewhere between; these 
  findings are established but incomplete. The high variation across studies for 
  the effects of mitigation on gas demand is associated with the importance of 
  its availability in different locations, its specific demand patterns, and the 
  potential for gas to replace coal in power generation. </p>
<p>These results are different from recent trends, which show natural gas usage 
  growing faster than the use of either coal or oil. They can be explained as 
  follows. In the transport sector, the largest user of oil, current technology 
  and infrastructure will not allow much switching from oil to non-fossil fuel 
  alternatives in Annex I countries before about 2020. Annex B countries can only 
  meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments by reducing overall energy use and this 
  will result in a reduction in natural gas demand, unless this is offset by a 
  switch towards natural gas for power generation. The modelling of such a switch 
  remains limited in these models. </p>
<h3> <a name="924"></a>9.2.4 Electricity</h3>
<p>In general as regards the effects on the electricity sector, mitigation policies 
  either mandate or directly provide incentives for increased use of zero-emitting 
  technologies (such as nuclear, hydro, and other renewables) and lower-GHG-emitting 
  generation technologies (such as combined cycle natural gas). Or, second, they 
  drive their increased use indirectly by more flexible approaches that place 
  a tax on or require a permit for emission of GHGs. Either way, the result will 
  be a shift in the mix of fuels used to generate electricity towards increased 
  use of the zero- and lower-emitting generation technologies, and away from the 
  higher-emitting fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Nuclear power would have substantial advantages as a result of GHG mitigation 
  policies, because power from nuclear fuel produces negligible GHGs. In spite 
  of this advantage, nuclear power is not seen as the solution to the global warming 
  problem in many countries. The main issues are (1) the high costs compared to 
  alternative CCGTs, (2) public acceptance involving operating safety and waste, 
  (3) safety of radioactive waste management and recycling of nuclear fuel, (4) 
  the risks of nuclear fuel transportation, and (5) nuclear weapons proliferation.</p>
<h3> <a name="925"></a>9.2.5 Transport</h3>
<p>Unless highly efficient vehicles (such as fuel cell vehicles) become rapidly 
  available, there are few options available to reduce transport energy use in 
  the short term, which do not involve significant economic, social, or political 
  costs. No government has yet demonstrated policies that can reduce the overall 
  demand for mobility, and all governments find it politically difficult to contemplate 
  such measures. Substantial additional improvements in aircraft energy efficiency 
  are most likely to be accomplished by policies that increase the price of, and 
  therefore reduce the amount of, air travel. Estimated price elasticities of 
  demand are in the range of -0.8 to -2.7. Raising the price of air travel by 
  taxes faces a number of political hurdles. Many of the bilateral treaties that 
  currently govern the operation of the air transport system contain provisions 
  for exemptions of taxes and charges, other than for the cost of operating and 
  improving the system.</p>
