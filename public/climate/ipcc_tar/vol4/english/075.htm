      <b>Figure 1:</b> Variations of the Earth's surface temperature over 
      the last 140 years and the last millennium.<br>
      <br>
      (a) The Earth's surface temperature is shown year by year (red bars) 
      and approximately decade by decade (black line, a filtered annual curve 
      suppressing fluctuations below near decadal <br>
      time-scales). There are uncertainties in the annual data (thin black whisker 
      bars represent the 95% confidence range) due to data gaps, random instrumental 
      errors and uncertainties, uncertainties in bias corrections in the ocean 
      surface temperature data and also in adjustments for urbanisation over the 
      land. Over both the last 140 years and 100 years, the best estimate is that 
      the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.6 &plusmn; 0.2&deg;C.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Additionally, the year by year (blue curve) and 50 year average (black 
      curve) variations of the average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere 
      for the past 1000 years have been reconstructed from "proxy" data 
      calibrated against thermometer data (see list of the main proxy data in 
      the diagram). The 95% confidence range in the annual data is represented 
      by the grey region. These uncertainties increase in more distant times and 
      are always much larger than in the instrumental record due to the use of 
      relatively sparse proxy data. Nevertheless the rate and duration of warming 
      of the 20th century has been much greater than in any of the previous nine 
      centuries. Similarly, it is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> that the 1990s have been the warmest

<p>This Summary for Policymakers (SPM), which was approved by IPCC member governments

<h3> </h3>
<h3>An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming 
  world and other changes in the climate system.</h3>
<p>Since the release of the Second Assessment Report (SAR<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a>), 
  additional data from new studies of current and palaeoclimates, improved analysis 
  of data sets, more rigorous evaluation of their quality, and comparisons among 
  data from different sources have led to greater understanding of climate change. 
</p>
<h4><b>The global average surface temperature has increased over the 20th century 
  by about 0.6&deg;C.</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>The global average surface temperature (the average of near surface air 
    temperature over land, and sea surface temperature) has increased since 1861. 
    Over the 20th century the increase has been 0.6 &plusmn; 0.2&deg;C<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a>, 
    <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
    (<a href="#figspm1">Figure 1a</a>). This value is about 0.15&deg;C 
    larger than that estimated by the SAR for the period up to 1994, owing to 
    the relatively high temperatures of the additional years (1995 to 2000) and 
    improved methods of processing the data. These numbers take into account various 
    adjustments, including urban heat island effects. The record shows a great 
    deal of variability; for example, most of the warming occurred during the 
    20th century, during two periods, 1910 to 1945 and 1976 to 2000. 
  <li>Globally, it is very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    that the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental 
    record, since 1861 (see <a href="#figspm1">Figure 1a</a>). 
  <li>New analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere indicate that the 
    increase in temperature in the 20th century is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to have been the largest of any century during the past 1,000 years. It is 
    also likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 
    the warmest year (<a href="#figspm1">Figure 1b</a>). Because 
    less data are available, less is known about annual averages prior to 1,000 
    years before present and for conditions prevailing in most of the Southern 
    Hemisphere prior to 1861.
<li>On average, between 1950 and 1993, night-time daily minimum air temperatures 
    over land increased by about 0.2&deg;C per decade. This is about twice the 
    rate of increase in daytime daily maximum air temperatures (0.1&deg;C per 
    decade). This has lengthened the freeze-free season in many mid- and high 
    latitude regions. The increase in sea surface temperature over this period 
    is about half that of the mean land surface air temperature. 
</ul>
<h4>Temperatures have risen during the past four decades in the lowest 8 kilometres 
  of the atmosphere.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Since the late 1950s (the period of adequate observations from weather balloons), 
    the overall global temperature increases in the lowest 8 kilometres of the 
    atmosphere and in surface temperature have been similar at 0.1&deg;C per decade. 
  <li>Since the start of the satellite record in 1979, both satellite and weather 
    balloon measurements show that the global average temperature of the lowest 
    8 kilometres of the atmosphere has changed by +0.05 &plusmn; 0.10&deg;C per 
    decade, but the global average surface temperature has increased significantly 
    by +0.15 &plusmn; 0.05&deg;C per decade. The difference in the warming rates 
    is statistically significant. This difference occurs primarily over the tropical 
    and sub-tropical regions. 
  <li>The lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and the surface are influenced 
    differently by factors such as stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric 
    aerosols, and the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon. Hence, it is physically plausible 
    to expect that over a short time period (e.g., 20 years) there may be differences 
    in temperature trends. In addition, spatial sampling techniques can also explain 
    some of the differences in trends, but these differences are not fully resolved.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Snow cover and ice extent have decreased.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Satellite data show that there are very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to have been decreases of about 10% in the extent of snow cover since the 
    late 1960s, and ground-based observations show that there is very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to have been a reduction of about two weeks in the annual duration of lake 
    and river ice cover in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, 
    over the 20th century.
  <li>There has been a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers in non-polar regions 
    during the 20th century. 
  <li>Northern Hemisphere spring and summer sea-ice extent has decreased by about 
    10 to 15% since the 1950s. It is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    that there has been about a 40% decline in Arctic sea-ice thickness during 
    late summer to early autumn in recent decades and a considerably slower decline 
    in winter sea-ice thickness.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Global average sea level has risen and ocean heat content has increased.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Tide gauge data show that global average sea level rose between 0.1 and 
    0.2 metres during the 20th century.
<li>Global ocean heat content has increased since the late 1950s, the period 
    for which adequate observations of sub-surface ocean temperatures have been 
    available.
