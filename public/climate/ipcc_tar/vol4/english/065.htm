      is closely linked with the environmental, social, and economic components 
      defining the status of each community. The interconnections among those 
      elements of sustainable development are reflected in <a href="#figspm83">Figure 
      8-3</a>, illustrating that important issues such as climate change, sustainability, 
      poverty, and equity can be related to all three components. Just as climate 
      policies can yield ancillary benefits that improve well-being, non-climate 
      socio-economic policies may bring climate benefits. Utilizing such ancillary 
      benefits would aid in making development more sustainable. Complex interactions 
      among environmental, social, and economic challenges exist, and therefore 
      none of these three types of problems can be resolved in isolation.<br>

      <b><a name="figspm83"></a>Figure 8-3: The vertices of the triangle represent 
      the three major dimensions or domains of sustainable development: economic, 
      social, and environmental.</b> The economic domain is geared mainly towards 
      improving human welfare, primarily through increases in the consumption 
      of goods and services. The environmental domain focuses on protection of 
      the integrity and resilience of ecological systems. The social domain emphasizes 
      the strengthening of human relationships and achievement of individual and 
      group aspirations. Examples of linkages between the three domains are shown 
      along the sides of the triangle. Important issues such as climate change, 
      poverty, equity, and sustainability lie within the triangle and interact 
      with all three domains. </td>

      governmental and civil institutions to enact the general objectives -- for 
      example, formulation of strategies and action plans as a framework for country-level
