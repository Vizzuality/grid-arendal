<h1>4 Technological and Economic Potential of Options to Enhance, Maintain and 
  Manage Biological Carbon Reservoirs and Geo-engineering</h1>
<h1><a name="41"></a>4.1 Mitigation through Terrestrial Ecosystem and Land Management</h1>
<p>Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer significant, 
  if often temporary, mitigation potential. Conservation and sequestration allow 
  time for other options to be further developed and implemented. The IPCC SAR 
  estimated that about 60 to 87GtC could be conserved or sequestered in forests 
  by the year 2050 and another 23 to 44GtC could be sequestered in agricultural 
  soils. The current assessment of the potential of biological mitigation options 
  is in the order of 100GtC (cumulative) by 2050, equivalent to about 10% to 20% 
  of projected fossil fuel emissions during that period. In this section, biological 
  mitigation measures in terrestrial ecosystems are assessed, focusing on the 
  mitigation potential, ecological and environmental constraints, economics, and 
  social considerations. Also, briefly, the so-called geo-engineering options 
  are discussed.</p>
<p>Increased carbon pools through the management of terrestrial ecosystems can 
  only partially offset fossil fuel emissions. Moreover, larger C stocks may pose 
  a risk for higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the future, if the C-conserving 
  practices are discontinued. For example, abandoning fire control in forests, 
  or reverting to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in a rapid loss 
  of at least part of the C accumulated during previous years. However, using 
  biomass as a fuel or wood to displace more energy-intensive materials can provide 
  permanent carbon mitigation benefits. It is useful to evaluate terrestrial sequestration 
  opportunities alongside emission reduction strategies, as both approaches will 
  likely be required to control atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p>Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach some maximum level. 
  The total amount of carbon stored and/or carbon emission avoided by a forest 
  management project at any given time is dependent on the specific management 
  practices (see <a href="#figTS6">Figure TS.6</a>). Thus, an ecosystem depleted 
  of carbon by past events may have a high potential rate of carbon accumulation, 
  while one with a large carbon pool tends to have a low rate of carbon sequestration. 
  As ecosystems eventually approach their maximum carbon pool, the sink (<i>i.e</i>., 
  the rate of change of the pool) will diminish. Although both the sequestration 
  rate and pool of carbon may be relatively high at some stages, they cannot be 
  maximized simultaneously. Thus, management strategies for an ecosystem may depend 
  on whether the goal is to enhance short-term accumulation or to maintain the 
  carbon reservoirs through time. The ecologically achievable balance between 
  the two goals is constrained by disturbance history, site productivity, and 
  target time frame. For example, options to maximize sequestration by 2010 may 
  not maximize sequestration by 2020 or 2050; in some cases, maximizing sequestration 
  by 2010 may lead to lower carbon storage over time.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of C mitigation strategies, and the security of expanded 
  C pools, will be affected by future global changes, but the impacts of these 
  changes will vary by geographical region, ecosystem type, and local abilities 
  to adapt. For example, increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, changes in climate, 
  modified nutrient cycles, and altered (either natural or human induced disturbance) 
  regimes can each have negative or positive effects on C pools in terrestrial 
  ecosystems.</p>

      <p><b>Figure TS.6</b>: Carbon balance from a hypothetical forest management 
        project.<br>
        Note: The figure shows cumulative carbon-stock changes for a scenario 
        involving afforestation and harvest for a mix of traditional forest products 
        with some of the harvest being used as a fuel. Values are illustrative 
        of what might be observed in the southeastern USA or Central Europe. Regrowth 
        restores carbon to the forest and the (hypothetical) forest stand is harvested 
        every 40 years, with some litter left on the ground to decay, and products 
        accumulate or are disposed of in landfills. These are net changes in that, 
        for example, the diagram shows savings in fossil fuel emissions with respect 
        to an alternative scenario that uses fossil fuels and alternative, more 
        energy-intensive products to provide the same services.</p>

<p><a name="figTS6"></a>In the past, land management has often resulted in reduced 
  C pools, but in many regions like Western Europe, C pools have now stabilized 
  and are recovering. In most countries in temperate and boreal regions forests 
  are expanding, although current C pools are still smaller than those in pre-industrial 
  or pre-historic times. While complete recovery of pre-historic C pools is unlikely, 
  there is potential for substantial increases in carbon stocks. The Food and 
  Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)'s 
  statistics suggest that the average net annual increment exceeded timber fellings 
  in managed boreal and temperate forests in the early 1990s. For example, C stocks 
  in live tree biomass have increased by 0.17GtC/yr in the USA and 0.11GtC/yr 
  in Western Europe, absorbing about 10% of global fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  for that time period. Though these estimates do not include changes in litter 
  and soils, they illustrate that land surfaces play a significant and changing 
  role in the atmospheric carbon budget. Enhancing these carbon pools provides 
  potentially powerful opportunities for climate mitigation.</p>
<p>In some tropical countries, however, the average net loss of forest carbon 
  stocks continues, though rates of deforestation may have declined slightly in 
  the past decade. In agricultural lands, options are now available to recover 
  partially the C lost during the conversion from forest or grasslands.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="42"></a>4.2 Social and Economic Considerations</h2>
<p>Land is a precious and limited resource used for many purposes in every country. 
  The relationship of climate mitigation strategies with other land uses may be 
  competitive, neutral, or symbiotic. An analysis of the literature suggests that 
  C mitigation strategies can be pursued as one element of more comprehensive 
  strategies aimed at sustainable development, where increasing C stocks is but 
  one of many objectives. Often, measures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, 
  and other land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also advance 
  other social, economic, and environmental goals. Carbon mitigation can provide 
  additional value and income to land management and rural development. Local 
  solutions and targets can be adapted to priorities of sustainable development 
  at national, regional, and global levels.</p>
<p>A key to making C mitigation activities effective and sustainable is to balance 
  it with other ecological and/or environmental, economic, and social goals of 
  land use. Many biological mitigation strategies may be neutral or favourable 
  for all three goals and become accepted as "no regrets" or "win-win" 
  solutions. In other cases, compromises may be needed. Important potential environmental 
  impacts include effects on biodiversity, effects on amount and quality of water 
  resources (particularly where they are already scarce), and long-term impacts 
  on ecosystem productivity. Cumulative environmental, economic, and social impacts 
  could be assessed in individual projects and also from broader, national and 
  international perspectives. An important issue is "leakage" - 
  an expanded or conserved C pool in one area leading to increased emissions elsewhere. 
  Social acceptance at the local, national, and global levels may also influence 
  how effectively mitigation policies are implemented.</p>
