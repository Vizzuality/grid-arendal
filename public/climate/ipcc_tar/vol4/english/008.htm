      uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and natural

      the estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing greenhouse 
      gases alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming. The 
      best agreement between model simulations and observations over the last

      SPM-1</a>). For instance, it is very likely that the 20th century warming 
      has contributed significantly to the observed sea-level rise, through thermal 
      expansion of seawater and widespread loss of land ice. Within present uncertainties, 
      observations and models are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration 
      of sea-level rise during the 20th century. There are no demonstrated changes 
      in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent from the years 1978 to 2000. In addition, 
      there are conflicting analyses and insufficient data to assess changes in 
      intensities of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and severe local storm 
      activity in the mid-latitudes. Some of the observed changes are regional 
      and some may be due to internal climate variations, natural forcings, or 
      regional human activities rather than attributed solely to global human 
      influence.</td>

            model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur from 
            both natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations represented 
            by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation 
            and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done 
            with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulfate 
            aerosols. And those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with 
            both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can 
            be seen that the inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible 
            explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature changes 
            over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained 
            in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors are included. These 
            results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain 
            the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other 
            forcings may also have contributed.</td>
