<h2>4.7. Human Health </h2>
<p>Global climate change will have diverse impacts on human health -- some positive, 
  most negative. Changes in the frequencies of extreme heat and cold, the frequencies 
  of floods and droughts, and the profile of local air pollution and aeroallergens 
  would affect population health directly. Other health impacts would result from 
  the impacts of climate change on ecological and social systems. These impacts 
  would include changes in infectious disease occurrence, local food production 
  and undernutrition, and various health consequences of population displacement 
  and economic disruption. </p>
<p><i>There is little published evidence that changes in population health status 
  actually have occurred in response to observed trends in climate over recent 
  decades.</i> A recurring difficulty in identifying such impacts is that the 
  causation of most human health disorders is multifactorial, and the "background" 
  socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental context changes significantly 
  over time.</p>
<p><i>Studies of the health impacts associated with interannual climate variability 
  (particularly those related to the El Ni&ntilde;o cycle) have provided new evidence 
  of human health sensitivity to climate, particularly for mosquito-borne diseases.</i> 
  The combination of existing research-based knowledge, resultant theoretical 
  understandings, and the output of predictive modeling leads to several conclusions 
  about the future impacts of climate change on human population health.</p>
<p><i>If heat waves increase in frequency and intensity, the risk of death and 
  serious illness would increase, principally in older age groups and the urban 
  poor (high confidence).</i> The effects of an increase in heat waves often would 
  be exacerbated by increased humidity and urban air pollution. The greatest increases 
  in thermal stress are forecast for mid- to high-latitude (temperate) cities, 
  especially in populations with nonadapted architecture and limited air conditioning. 
  Modeling of heat wave impacts in urban populations, allowing for acclimatization, 
  suggests that a number of U.S. cities would experience, on average, several 
  hundred extra deaths each summer. Although the impact of climate change on thermal 
  stress-related mortality in developing country cities may be significant, there 
  has been little research in such populations. Warmer winters and fewer cold 
  spells will decrease cold-related mortality in many temperate countries (high 
  confidence). Limited evidence indicates that in at least some temperate countries, 
  reduced winter deaths would outnumber increased summer deaths (medium confidence). 
  [<a href="../../wg2/353.htm">9.4</a>]</p>
<p><i>Any increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as storms, 
  floods, droughts, and cyclones would adversely impact human health through a 
  variety of pathways.</i> These natural hazards can cause direct loss of life 
  and injury and can affect health indirectly through loss of shelter, population 
  displacement, contamination of water supplies, loss of food production (leading 
  to hunger and malnutrition), increased risk of infectious disease epidemics 
  (including diarrhoeal and respiratory disease), and damage to infrastructure 
  for provision of health services (very high confidence). If cyclones were to 
  increase regionally, devastating impacts often would occur, particularly in 
  densely settled populations with inadequate resources. Over recent years, major 
  climate-related disasters have had major adverse effects on human health, including 
  floods in China, Bangladesh, Europe, Venezuela, and Mozambique, as well as Hurricane 
  Mitch, which devastated Central America. [<a href="../../wg2/354.htm">9.5</a>]</p>
<p><i>Climate change will decrease air quality in urban areas with air pollution 
  problems (medium confidence).</i> An increase in temperature (and, in some models, 
  ultraviolet radiation) increases the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant 
  with well-established adverse effects on respiratory health. Effects of climate 
  change on other air pollutants are less well established. [<a href="../../wg2/356.htm">9.6</a>]</p>
<p><i>Higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and changes in climate variability 
  would alter the geographic ranges and seasonality of transmission of vector-borne 
  infectious diseases --  extending the range and season for some infectious 
  diseases and contracting them for others.</i> Vector-borne infectious diseases 
  are transmitted by blood-feeding organisms such as mosquitoes and ticks. Such 
  organisms depend on the complex interaction of climate and other ecological 
  factors for survival. Currently, 40% of the world population lives in areas 
  with malaria. In areas with limited or deteriorating public health infrastructure, 
  increased temperatures will tend to expand the geographic range of malaria transmission 
  to higher altitudes (high to medium confidence) and higher latitudes (medium 
  to low confidence). Higher temperatures, in combination with conducive patterns 
  of rainfall and surface water, will extend the transmission season in some locations 
  (high confidence). Changes in climate, including changes in climate variability, 
  would affect many other vector-borne infections (such as dengue, leishmansiasis, 
  various types of mosquito-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis) 
  at the margins of their current distributions (medium/high confidence). For 
  some vector-borne diseases in some locations, climate change will decrease transmission 
  via reductions in rainfall or temperatures that are too high for transmission 
  (medium confidence). A range of mathematical models indicate, with high consistency, 
  that climate change scenarios over the coming century would cause a small net 
  increase in the proportion of the world's population living in regions of potential 
  transmission of malaria and dengue (medium to high confidence). A change in 
  climatic conditions will increase the incidence of various types of water- and 
  food-borne infectious diseases. [<a href="../../wg2/358.htm">9.7</a>]</p>
<p><i>Climate change may cause changes in the marine environment that would alter 
  risks of biotoxin poisoning from human consumption of fish and shellfish.</i> 
  Biotoxins associated with warmer waters, such as ciguatera in tropical waters, 
  could extend their range to higher latitudes (low confidence). Higher SSTs also 
  would increase the occurrence of toxic algal blooms (medium confidence), which 
  have complex relationships with human poisoning and are ecologically and economically 
  damaging. Changes in surface water quantity and quality will affect the incidence 
  of diarrhoeal diseases (medium confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/367.htm">9.8</a>]</p>
<p><i>Changes in food supply resulting from climate change could affect the nutrition 
  and health of the poor in some regions of the world.</i> Studies of climate 
  change impacts on food production indicate that, globally, impacts could be 
  positive or negative, but the risk of reduced food yields is greatest in developing 
  countries -- where 790 million people are estimated to be undernourished at 
  present. Populations in isolated areas with poor access to markets will be particularly 
  vulnerable to local decreases or disruptions in food supply. Undernourishment 
  is a fundamental cause of stunted physical and intellectual development in children, 
  low productivity in adults, and susceptibility to infectious disease. Climate 
  change would increase the number of undernourished people in the developing 
  world (medium confidence), particularly in the tropics. [<a href="../../wg2/368.htm">9.9</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/208.htm">5.3</a>]</p>
<p><i>In some settings, the impacts of climate change may cause social disruption, 
  economic decline, and population displacement that would affect human health.</i> 
  Health impacts associated with population displacement resulting from natural 
  disasters or environmental degradation are substantial (high confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/369.htm">9.10</a>]</p>
<p><i>For each anticipated adverse health impact there is a range of social, institutional, 
  technological, and behavioral adaptation options to lessen that impact</i> (see 
  <a href="#tabts5">Table TS-5</a>). Overall, the adverse health 
  impacts of climate change will be greatest in vulnerable lower income populations, 
  predominately within tropical/subtropical countries. There is a basic and general 
  need for public health infrastructure (programs, services, surveillance systems) 
  to be strengthened and maintained. The ability of affected communities to adapt 
  to risks to health also depends on social, environmental, political, and economic 
  circumstances. [<a href="../../wg2/370.htm">9.11</a>]</p>
