      <p>The answer to this question recognizes two major points. The first is 
        that the human impacts on the environment are manifested in several issues, 
        many driven by common factors associated with the meeting of human needs. 
        The second is that many of these issues -- their causes and impacts -- are 
        biogeophysically and socio-economically interrelated. With a central emphasis 
        on climate change, this answer assesses the current understanding of the 
        interrelations between the causes and impacts of the key environmental 
        issues of today. To that is added a summary of the now largely separate 
        policy approaches to these issues. In so doing, this answer frames how 
        choices associated with one issue may positively or negatively influence 
        another. With such knowledge, there is the prospect of efficient integrated 
        approaches.<br>

      <p><span class="blue2">Meeting human needs is degrading the environment 
        in many instances, and environmental degradation is hampering the meeting 
        of human needs.</span> Society has a range of socio-economic paths to 
        development; however, these will only be sustainable if due consideration 
        is given to the environment. Environmental degradation is already evident 
        at the local, regional, and global scale, such as air pollution, scarcity 
        of freshwater, deforestation, desertification, acid deposition, loss of 
        biological diversity and changes at the genetic and species level, land 
        degradation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change. Very frequently, 
        addressing human needs causes or exacerbates several environmental problems, 
        which may increase the vulnerability to climatic changes. For example, 
        with the aim of higher agricultural production, there is increased use 
        of nitrogeneous fertilizers, irrigation, and conversion of forested areas 
        to croplands. These agricultural activities can affect the Earth's 
        climate through release of greenhouse gases, degrade land by erosion and 
        salinization, and reduce biodiversity. In turn, an environmental change 
        can impact meeting human needs. For example, agricultural productivity 
        can be adversely affected by changes in the magnitude and pattern of rainfall, 
        and human health in an urban environment can be impacted by heat waves.<br>
