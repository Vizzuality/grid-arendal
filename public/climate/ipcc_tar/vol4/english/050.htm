      of greenhouse gas emissions, even stabilization of their concentrations 
      in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether prevent climate 
      change or sea-level rise nor altogether prevent their impacts. Many reactive 
      adaptations will occur in response to the changing climate and rising seas 
      and some have already occurred. In addition, the development of planned 
      adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize opportunities can complement 
      mitigation actions to lessen climate change impacts. However, adaptation 
      would entail costs and cannot prevent all damages. Adaptation implemented 
      in combination with mitigation can be a more cost-effective approach to 
      reducing the impacts of climate change than either applied alone. The potential 
      for adaptation to substantially reduce many of the adverse impacts of climate 
      change was assessed in <a href="026.htm">Question 3</a>. Because there are 
      overlapping ranges of global temperature increases associated with the various 
      stabilization levels (see <a href="047.htm#figspm61">Figure 6-1</a>c), many 
      adaptation options will be appropriate for a range of stabilization levels. 
      Improved knowledge will narrow the uncertainties associated with particular 
      stabilization levels and identification of appropriate adaptation strategies.<br>

      events. The smaller changes to which systems would be exposed, and slower 
      pace at which stresses would increase, would allow more time for adaptation 
      and lessen the degree to which current practices for coping with climate 
      variability and extremes might need to be modified (see <a href="026.htm">Question 
      3</a>). More aggressive mitigation efforts will therefore reduce adaptation 
      costs to attain a specified level of effectiveness.<br>

      As described in <a href="026.htm">Question 3</a>, risks associated 
      with climate change have the potential to undermine progress toward sustainable 
      development (e.g., damages from extreme climate events, water shortage and 
      degraded water quality, good supply disruptions and hunger, land degradation, 
      and diminished human health). Byreducing these risks, climate change mitigation 
      and adaptation policies can improve the prospects for sustainable development.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnsyn.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a><br>

      change pressures can exacerbate inequities between developing and developed 
      countries; lessening these pressures through mitigation and enhancement 
      of adaptive capacity can reduce these inequities. People in developing countries, 
      particularly the poorest people in these countries, are considered to be 
      more vulnerable to climate change than people in developed countries (see 
      <a href="026.htm">Question 3</a>). Reducing the rate of warming and sea-level 
      rise and increasing the capacity to adapt to climate change would benefit 
      all countries, particularly developing countries<br>

      atmosphere-ocean-climate system and the long-lived and sometimes irreversible 
      effects of climate change on the environment. Future generations are generally 
      anticipated to be wealthier, better educated and informed, and technologically 
      more advanced than the present generation and consequently better able to 
      adapt in many respects. But the changes set in motion in coming decades 
      will accumulate and some could reach magnitudes that would severely test 
      the abilities of many societies to cope. For irreversible impacts, such 
      as the extinction of species or loss of unique ecosystems, there are no 
      adaptation responses that can fully remedy the losses. Mitigating climate
