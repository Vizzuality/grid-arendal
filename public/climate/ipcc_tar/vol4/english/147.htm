<h2>5.4. Europe</h2>
<p>Present-day weather conditions affect natural, social, and economic systems 
  in Europe in ways that reveal sensitivities and vulnerabilities to climate change 
  in these systems. Climate change may aggravate such effects (very high confidence). 
  Vulnerability to climate change in Europe differs substantially between subregions. 
  Southern Europe and the European Arctic are more vulnerable than other parts 
  of Europe. More-marginal and less-wealthy areas will be less able to adapt, 
  which leads to important equity implications (very high confidence). Findings 
  in the TAR relating to key vulnerabilities in Europe are broadly consistent 
  with those expressed in the IPCC <i>Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate 
  Change</i> and the SAR, but are more specific about subregional effects and 
  include new information concerning adaptive capacity. [<a href="../../wg2/493.htm#1311">13.1.1</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/494.htm#1314">13.1.4</a>, <a href="../../wg2/512.htm">13.4</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="541"></a>5.4.1. Water Resources</h3>
<p><i>Water resources and their management in Europe are under pressure now, and 
  these pressures are likely to be exacerbated by climate change (high confidence).</i> 
  Flood hazard is likely to increase across much of Europe -- except where snowmelt 
  peak has been reduced -- and the risk of water shortage is projected to increase, 
  particularly in southern Europe (medium to high confidence). Climate change 
  is likely to widen water resource differences between northern and southern 
  Europe (high confidence). Half of Europe's alpine glaciers could disappear by 
  the end of the 21st century. [<a href="../../wg2/497.htm#1321">13.2.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="542"></a>5.4.2. Ecosystems</h3>
<p><i>Natural ecosystems will change as a result of increasing temperature and 
  atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>.</i> Permafrost will decline; trees 
  and shrubs will encroach into current northern tundra; and broad-leaved trees 
  may encroach into current coniferous forest areas. Net primary productivity 
  in ecosystems is likely to increase (also as a result of nitrogen deposition), 
  but increases in decomposition resulting from increasing temperature may negate 
  any additional carbon storage. Diversity in nature reserves is under threat 
  from rapid change. Loss of important habitats (wetlands, tundra, and isolated 
  habitats) would threaten some species (including rare/endemic species and migratory 
  birds). Faunal shifts as a result of ecosystem changes are expected in marine, 
  aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence; established but incomplete 
  evidence). [<a href="../../wg2/500.htm">13.2.1.4</a>, 
  <a href="../../wg2/501.htm#13221">13.2.2.1</a>, 
   <a href="../../wg2/502.htm">13.2.2.3-5</a>]</p>
<p>Soil properties will deteriorate under warmer and drier climate scenarios in 
  southern Europe. The magnitude of this effect will vary markedly between geographic 
  locations and may be modified by changes in precipitation (medium confidence; 
  established but incomplete evidence). [<a href="../../wg2/498.htm">13.2.1.2</a>]</p>
<p>In mountain regions, higher temperatures will lead to an upward shift of biotic 
  zones. There will be a redistribution of species with, in some instances, a 
  threat of extinction (high confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/500.htm">13.2.1.4</a>]</p>
<p>Timber harvest will increase in commercial forests in northern Europe (medium 
  confidence; established but incomplete evidence), although forest pests and 
  disease may increase. Reductions are likely in the Mediterranean, with increased 
  drought and fire risk (high confidence; well-established evidence). [<a href="../../wg2/501.htm#13221">13.2.2.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="543"></a>5.4.3. Agriculture and Food Security</h3>
<p><i>Agricultural yields will increase for most crops as a result of increasing 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</i> This increase in yields would 
  be counteracted by the risk of water shortage in southern and eastern Europe 
  and by shortening of the duration of growth in many grain crops because of increasing 
  temperature. Northern Europe is likely to experience overall positive effects, 
  whereas some agricultural production systems in southern Europe may be threatened 
  (medium confidence; established but incomplete evidence).</p>
<p>Changes in fisheries and aquaculture production resulting from climate change 
  embrace faunal shifts that affect freshwater and marine fish and shellfish biodiversity. 
  These changes will be aggravated by unsustainable exploitation levels and environmental 
  change (high confidence).</p>
<h3><a name="544"></a>5.4.4. Human Settlements and Financial Services</h3>
<p><i>The insurance industry faces potentially costly climate change impacts through 
  the medium of property damage, but there is great scope for adaptive measures 
  if initiatives are taken soon (high confidence).</i> Transport, energy, and 
  other industries will face changing demand and market opportunities. The concentration 
  of industry on the coast exposes it to sea-level rise and extreme events, necessitating 
  protection or removal (high confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/505.htm">13.2.4</a>]</p>
<p>Recreational preferences are likely to change with higher temperatures. Heat 
  waves are likely to reduce the traditional peak summer demand at Mediterranean 
  holiday destinations. Less-reliable snow conditions will impact adversely on 
  winter tourism (medium confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/506.htm">13.2.4.4</a>]</p>
<p>The risk of flooding, erosion, and wetland loss in coastal areas will increase 
  substantially, with implications for human settlement, industry, tourism, agriculture, 
  and coastal natural habitats. Southern Europe appears to be more vulnerable 
  to these changes, although the North Sea coast already has a high exposure to 
  flooding (high confidence). <a href="#tabts10">Table TS-10</a> 
  provides estimates of flood exposure and risk for Europe's coasts. [<a href="../../wg2/499.htm">13.2.1.3</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="545"></a>5.4.5. Human Health</h3>
<p>A range of risks is posed for human health through increased exposure to heat 
  episodes (exacerbated by air pollution in urban areas), extension of some vector-borne 
  diseases, and coastal and riverine flooding. Cold-related risks will be reduced 
  (medium confidence; competing explanations). [<a href="../../wg2/507.htm">13.2.5</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="546"></a>5.4.6. Adaptive Capacity</h3>
<p>The adaptation potential of socioeconomic systems in Europe is relatively high 
  because of economic conditions [high gross national product (GNP) and stable 
  growth], a stable population (with the capacity to move within the region), 
  and well-developed political, institutional, and technological support systems. 
  However, the adaptation potential for natural systems generally is low (very 
  high confidence). [<a href="../../wg2/508.htm">13.3</a>]</p>
