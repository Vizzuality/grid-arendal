<h3><a name="332"></a>3.3.2 The Main Mitigation Options in the Transport Sector</h3>
<p>In 1995, the transport sector contributed 22% of global energy-related carbon 
  dioxide emissions; globally, emissions from this sector are growing at a rapid 
  rate of approximately 2.5% annually. Since 1990, principal growth has been in 
  the developing countries (7.3% per year in the Asia-Pacific region) and 
  is actually declining at a rate of 5.0% per year for the EITs. Hybrid gasoline-electric 
  vehicles have been introduced on a commercial basis with fuel economies 50%-100% 
  better than those of comparably sized four-passenger vehicles. Biofuels produced 
  from wood, energy crops, and waste may also play an increasingly important role 
  in the transportation sector as enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic material 
  to ethanol becomes more cost effective. Meanwhile, biodiesel, supported by tax 
  exemptions, is gaining market share in Europe. Incremental improvements in engine 
  design have, however, largely been used to enhance performance rather than to 
  improve fuel economy, which has not increased since the SAR. Fuel cell powered 
  vehicles are developing rapidly, and are scheduled to be introduced to the market 
  in 2003. Significant improvements in the fuel economy of aircraft appear to 
  be both technically and economically possible for the next generation fleet. 
  Nevertheless, most evaluations of the technological efficiency improvements 
  (<a href="#tabTS3">Table TS.3</a>) show that because of growth in demand for 
  transportation, efficiency improvement alone is not enough to avoid GHG emission 
  growth. Also, there is evidence that, other things being equal, efforts to improve 
  fuel efficiency have only partial effects in emission reduction because of resulting 
  increases in driving distances caused by lower specific operational costs. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="333"></a>3.3.3 The Main Mitigation Options in the Industry Sector</h3>
<p>Industrial emissions account for 43% of carbon released in 1995. Industrial 
  sector carbon emissions grew at a rate of 1.5% per year between 1971 and 1995, 
  slowing to 0.4% per year since 1990. Industries continue to find more energy 
  efficient processes and reductions of process-related GHGs. This is the only 
  sector that has shown an annual decrease in carbon emissions in OECD economies 
  (-0.8%/yr between 1990 and 1995). The CO<sub>2</sub> from EITs declined most 
  strongly (-6.4% per year between 1990 and 1995 when total industrial production 
  dropped). </p>
<p>Differences in the energy efficiency of industrial processes between different 
  developed countries, and between developed and developing countries remain large, 
  which means that there are substantial differences in relative emission reduction 
  potentials between countries.</p>
<p>Improvement of the energy efficiency of industrial processes is the most significant 
  option for lowering GHG emissions. This potential is made up of hundreds of 
  sector-specific technologies. The worldwide potential for energy efficiency 
  improvement - compared to a baseline development - for the year 2010 
  is estimated to be 300-500MtC and for the year 2020 700-900MtC. In the latter 
  case continued technological development is necessary to realize the potential. 
  The majority of energy efficiency improvement options can be realized at net 
  negative costs. </p>
<p>Another important option is material efficiency improvement (including recycling, 
  more efficient product design, and material substitution); this may represent 
  a potential of 600MtC in the year 2020. Additional opportunities for CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions reduction exist through fuel switching, CO<sub>2</sub> removal and 
  storage, and the application of blended cements.</p>
<p>A number of specific processes not only emit CO<sub>2</sub>, but also non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  GHGs. The adipic acid manufacturers have strongly reduced their N<sub>2</sub>O 
  emissions, and the aluminium industry has made major gains in reducing the release 
  of PFCs (CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>). Further reduction of non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  GHGs from manufacturing industry to low levels is often possible at relatively 
  low costs per tonne of C-equivalent (tC<sub>eq</sub>) mitigated.</p>
<p>Sufficient technological options are known today to reduce GHG emissions from 
  industry in absolute terms in most developed countries by 2010, and to limit 
  growth of emissions in this sector in developing countries significantly.<br>

  <a name="334"></a>3.3.4 The Main Mitigation Options in the Agricultural Sector</h3>
<p>Agriculture contributes only about 4% of global carbon emissions from energy 
  use, but over 20% of anthropogenic GHG emissions (in terms of MtC<sub>eq</sub>/yr) 
  mainly from CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O as well as carbon from land clearing. 
  There have been modest gains in energy efficiency for the agricultural sector 
  since the SAR, and biotechnology developments related to plant and animal production 
  could result in additional gains, provided concerns about adverse environmental 
  effects can be adequately addressed. A shift from meat towards plant production 
  for human food purposes, where feasible, could increase energy efficiency and 
  decrease GHG emissions (especially N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> from the 
  agricultural sector). Significant abatement of GHG emissions can be achieved 
  by 2010 through changes in agricultural practices, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>soil carbon uptake enhanced by conservation tillage and reduction of land 
    use intensity;</li>
  <li>CH<sub>4</sub> reduction by rice paddy irrigation management, improved fertilizer 
    use, and lower enteric CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from ruminant animals;</li>
  <li>avoiding anthropogenic agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (which for 
    agriculture exceeds carbon emission from fossil fuel use) through the use 
    of slow release fertilizers, organic manure, nitrification inhibitors, and 
    potentially genetically-engineered leguminous plants. N<sub>2</sub>O emissions 
    are greatest in China and the USA, mainly from fertilizer use on rice paddy 
    soils and other agricultural soils. More significant contributions can be 
    made by 2020 when more options to control N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from fertilized 
    soils are expected to become available. </li>
</ul>
<p>Uncertainties on the intensity of use of these technologies by farmers are 
  high, since they may have additional costs involved in their uptake. Economic 
  and other barriers may have to be removed through targetted policies.</p>
