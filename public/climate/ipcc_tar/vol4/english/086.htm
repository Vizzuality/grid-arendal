<h2>C.1 Observed Changes in Globally Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Concentrations 
  and Radiative Forcing</h2>
Over the millennium before the Industrial Era, the atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases remained relatively constant. Since then, however, the concentrations 
of many greenhouse gases have increased directly or indirectly because of human 
activities.<br>
<p><a href="#tabTechSum1">Table 1</a> provides examples of several greenhouse 
  gases and summarises their 1750 and 1998 concentrations, their change during 
  the 1990s, and their atmospheric lifetimes. The contribution of a species to 
  radiative forcing of climate change depends on the molecular radiative properties 
  of the gas, the size of the increase in atmospheric concentration, and the residence 
  time of the species in the atmosphere, once emitted. <i>The latter - the 
  atmospheric residence time of the greenhouse gas - is a highly policy relevant 
  characteristic. Namely, emissions of a greenhouse gas that has a long atmospheric 
  residence time is a quasi-irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing 
  over decades, centuries, or millennia, before natural processes can remove the 
  quantities emitted.</i></p>

<i>The atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> has increased from 280 ppm<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
in 1750 to 367 ppm in 1999 (31%, <a href="#tabTechSum1">Table 1</a>). Today's 
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years 
and likely not during the past 20 million years. The rate of increase over the 
past century is unprecedented, at least during the past 20,000 years (<a href="#figTechSum10">Figure 
10</a>).</i> The CO<sub>2</sub> isotopic composition and the observed decrease 
in Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) demonstrates that the observed increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
is predominately due to the oxidation of organic carbon by fossil-fuel combustion 
and deforestation. An expanding set of palaeo-atmospheric data from air trapped 
in ice over hundreds of millennia provide a context for the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentrations during the Industrial Era (<a href="#figTechSum10">Figure 10</a>). 
Compared to the relatively stable CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (280 &plusmn; 
10 ppm) of the preceding several thousand years, the increase during the Industrial 
Era is dramatic. The average rate of increase since 1980 is 0.4%/yr. The increase 
is a consequence of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most of the emissions during the 
past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning, the rest (10 to 30%) is predominantly 
due to land-use change, especially deforestation. As shown in <a href="085.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 
9</a>, CO<sub>2</sub> is the dominant human-influenced greenhouse gas, with a 
current radiative forcing of 1.46 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, being 60% of the total from 
the changes in concentrations of all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse 
gases.<br>
<p><i>Direct atmospheric measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations made over 
  the past 40 years show that year to year fluctuations in the rate of increase 
  of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are large. In the 1990s, the annual rates of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase in the atmosphere varied from 0.9 to 2.8 ppm/yr, equivalent to 1.9 
  to 6.0 PgC/yr.</i> Such annual changes can be related statistically to short-term 
  climate variability, which alters the rate at which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is taken up and released by the oceans and land. The highest rates of increase 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> have typically been in strong El Ni&ntilde;o years 
  (<a href="092.htm#box4">Box 4</a>). These higher rates of increase can be plausibly 
  explained by reduced terrestrial uptake (or terrestrial outgassing) of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  during El Ni&ntilde;o years, overwhelming the tendency of the ocean to take 
  up more CO<sub>2</sub> than usual.</p>
<p><i>Partitioning of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> between atmospheric increases 
  and land and ocean uptake for the past two decades can now be calculated from 
  atmospheric observations.</i> <a href="#tabTechSum2">Table 2</a> 
  presents a global CO<sub>2</sub> budget for the 1980s (which proves to be similar 
  to the one constructed with the help of ocean model results in the SAR) and 
  for the 1990s. Measurements of the decrease in atmospheric oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) 
  as well as the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> were used in the construction of these 
  new budgets. Results from this approach are consistent with other analyses based 
  on the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and with independent 
  estimates based on measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater. 
  The 1990s budget is based on newly available measurements and updates the budget 
  for 1989 to 1998 derived using SAR methodology for the IPCC Special Report on 
  Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (2000). The terrestrial biosphere as 
  a whole has gained carbon during the 1980s and 1990s; i.e., the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  released by land-use change (mainly tropical deforestation) was more than compensated 
  by other terrestrial sinks, which are likely located in both the northern extra-tropics 
  and in the tropics. There remain large uncertainties associated with estimating 
  the CO<sub>2</sub> release due to land-use change (and, therefore, with the 
  magnitude of the residual terrestrial sink).</p>
<p><i>Process-based modelling (terrestrial and ocean carbon models) has allowed 
  preliminary quantification of mechanisms in the global carbon cycle.</i> Terrestrial 
  model results indicate that enhanced plant growth due to higher CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation) and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition contribute 
  significantly to CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, i.e., are potentially responsible for 
  the residual terrestrial sink described above, along with other proposed mechanisms, 
  such as changes in land-management practices. The modelled effects of climate 
  change during the 1980s on the terrestrial sink are small and of uncertain sign.</p>
