<h2><a name="63"></a>6.3 International Policies and Measures</h2>
<p>Turning to international policies and measures, the Kyoto Protocol defines 
  three international policy instruments, the so-called Kyoto mechanisms: international 
  emissions trading (IET), joint implementation (JI), and the Clean Development 
  Mechanism (CDM). Each of these international policy instruments provides opportunities 
  for Annex I Parties to fulfil their commitments cost-effectively. IET essentially 
  would allow Annex I Parties to exchange part of their assigned national emission 
  allowances (targets). IET implies that countries with high marginal abatement 
  costs (MACs) may acquire emission reductions from countries with low MACs. Similarly, 
  JI would allow Annex I Parties to exchange emission reduction units among themselves 
  on a project-by-project basis. Under the CDM, Annex I Parties would receive 
  credit - on a project-by-project basis - for reductions accomplished 
  in non-Annex I countries.</p>
<p>Economic analyses indicate that the Kyoto mechanisms could reduce significantly 
  the overall cost of meeting the Kyoto emissions limitation commitments. However, 
  achievement of the potential cost savings requires the adoption of domestic 
  policies that allow individual entities to use the mechanisms to meet their 
  national emissions limitation obligations. If domestic policies limit the use 
  of the Kyoto mechanisms, or international rules governing the mechanisms limit 
  their use, the cost savings may be reduced.<br>
  <br>
  In the case of JI, host governments have incentives to ensure that emission 
  reduction units (ERUs) are issued only for real emission reductions, assuming 
  that they face strong penalties for non-compliance with national emissions limitation 
  commitments. In the case of CDM, a process for independent certification of 
  emission reductions is crucial, because host governments do not have emissions 
  limitation commitments and hence may have less incentive to ensure that certified 
  emission reductions (CERs) are issued only for real emission reductions. The 
  main difficulty in implementing project-based mechanisms, both JI and CDM, is 
  determining the net additional emission reduction (or sink enhancement) achieved; 
  baseline definition may be extremely complex. Various other aspects of these 
  Kyoto mechanisms are awaiting further decision making, including: monitoring 
  and verification procedures, financial additionality (assurance that CDM projects 
  will not displace traditional development assistance flows), and possible means 
  of standardizing methodologies for project baselines.<br>
  <br>
  The extent to which developing country (non-Annex I) Parties will effectively 
  implement their commitments under the UNFCCC may depend, among other factors, 
  on the transfer of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs).<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2><a name="64"></a>6.4 Implementation of National and International Policy Instruments</h2>
<p>Any international or domestic policy instrument can be effective only if accompanied 
  by adequate systems of monitoring and enforcement. There is a linkage between 
  compliance enforcement and the amount of international co-operation that will 
  actually be sustained. Many multilateral environmental agreements address the 
  need to co-ordinate restrictions on conduct taken in compliance with obligations 
  they impose and the expanding legal regime under the WTO and/or GATT umbrella. 
  Neither the UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol now provides for specific trade measures 
  in response to non-compliance. But several domestic policies and measures that 
  might be developed and implemented in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol could 
  conflict with WTO provisions. International differences in environmental regulation 
  may have trade implications.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns in environmental agreements (including the UNFCCC 
  and the Kyoto Protocol) has been with reaching wider participation. The literature 
  on international environmental agreements predicts that participation will be 
  incomplete, and incentives may be needed to increase participation (see also 
  <a href="198.htm">Section 10</a>).</p>
