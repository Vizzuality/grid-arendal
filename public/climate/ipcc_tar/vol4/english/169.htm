<h1><a name="23"></a>2.3 Global Futures Scenarios </h1>
<p>Global futures scenarios do not specifically or uniquely consider GHG emissions. 
  Instead, they are more general "stories" of possible future worlds. 
  They can complement the more quantitative emissions scenario assessments, because 
  they consider dimensions that elude quantification, such as governance and social 
  structures and institutions, but which are nonetheless important to the success 
  of mitigation policies. Addressing these issues reflects the different perspectives 
  presented in <a href="165.htm">Section 1</a>: cost-effectiveness and/or efficiency, 
  equity, and sustainability.</p>
<p>A survey of this literature has yielded a number of insights that are relevant 
  to GHG emissions scenarios and sustainable development. First, a wide range 
  of future conditions has been identified by futurists, ranging from variants 
  of sustainable development to collapse of social, economic, and environmental 
  systems. Since future values of the underlying socio-economic drivers of emissions 
  may vary widely, it is important that climate policies should be designed so 
  that they are resilient against widely different future conditions.</p>
<p>Second, the global futures scenarios that show falling GHG emissions tend to 
  show improved governance, increased equity and political participation, reduced 
  conflict, and improved environmental quality. They also tend to show increased 
  energy efficiency, shifts to non-fossil energy sources, and/or shifts to a post-industrial 
  (service-based) economy; population tends to stabilize at relatively low levels, 
  in many cases thanks to increased prosperity, expanded provision of family planning, 
  and improved rights and opportunities for women. A key implication is that sustainable 
  development policies can make a significant contribution to emission reduction.</p>
<p>Third, different combinations of driving forces are consistent with low emissions 
  scenarios, which agrees with the SRES findings. The implication of this seems 
  to be that it is important to consider the linkage between climate policy and 
  other policies and conditions associated with the choice of future paths in 
  a general sense. <br>

<h2><a name="24"></a>2.4 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</h2>
<p>Six new GHG emission reference scenario groups (not including specific climate 
  policy initiatives), organized into 4 scenario "families", were developed 
  by the IPCC and published as the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). 
  Scenario families A1 and A2 emphasize economic development but differ with respect 
  to the degree of economic and social convergence; B1 and B2 emphasize sustainable 
  development but also differ in terms of degree of convergence (see <a href="#boxTS1">Box 
  TS.1</a>). In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios that comprise 
  the six scenario groups. Six of these scenarios, which should be considered 
  equally sound, were chosen to illustrate the whole set of scenarios. These six 
  scenarios include marker scenarios for each of the worlds as well as two scenarios, 
  A1FI and A1T, which illustrate alternative energy technology developments in 
  the A1 world (see <a href="#figTS1">Figure TS.1</a>). </p>
<p>The SRES scenarios lead to the following findings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can lead to similar 
    levels and structure of energy use, land-use patterns, and emissions.</li>
  <li>Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future development trends 
    exist within each scenario family.</li>
  <li>Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of SRES scenarios. They 
    portray trend reversals and indicate possible emissions cross-over among different 
    scenarios. </li>
  <li>Describing potential future developments involves inherent ambiguities and 
    uncertainties. One and only one possible development path (as alluded to, 
    for instance, in concepts such as "business-as-usual scenario") 
    simply does not exist. The multi-model approach increases the value of the 
    SRES scenario set, since uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions 
    can be more explicitly separated from the specific model behaviour and related 
    modelling uncertainties.<a name="boxTS1"></a></li>

        <p><b>Box TS.1. The Emissions Scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on 
          Emissions Scenarios (SRES)</b></p>
        <p align="left">A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describe a future 
          world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in 
          mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new 
          and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence 
          among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social 
          interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in 
          per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups 
          that describe alternative directions of technological change in the 
          energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological 
          emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), 
          or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as 
          not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption 
          that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end-use 
          technologies).</p>
        <p align="left">A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describe a very 
          heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation 
          of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very 
          slowly, which results in a continuously increasing population. Economic 
          development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic 
          growth and technological change more fragmented and slower than in other 
          storylines.</p>
        <p align="left">B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describe a convergent 
          world with the same global population, which peaks in mid-century and 
          declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in 
          economic structures towards a service and information economy, with 
          reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient 
          technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, 
          and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without 
          additional climate initiatives.</p>
        <p align="left">B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describe a world 
          in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and 
          environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing 
          global population, at a rate lower than in A2, intermediate levels of 
          economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological 
          change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also 
          oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses 
          on local and regional levels.</p>
        <p align="left">An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six 
          scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1, and B2. All should be considered 
          equally sound.</p>
        <p align="left">The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, 
          which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation 
          of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the 
          emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol.<br>
