              generally accepted meaning across all the disciplines involved in 
              the TAR. The following definitions are applied for the purpose of 
              responding to this question:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Time scale" is the time taken for a perturbation 
                in a process to show at least half of its final effect. The time 
                scales of some key Earth system processes are shown in Figure 
                5-1.</li>
              <li>"Inertia" means a delay, slowness, or resistance in 
                the response of climate, biological, or human systems to factors 
                that alter their rate of change, including continuation of change 
                in the system after the cause of that change has been removed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are only two of several concepts used in the literature
              to  describe the responses of complex, non-linear, adaptive systems
              
              to external forcing.</p>

      all processes with time scales greater than a human generation, since a 
      large part of the consequences of activities of a given generation will 
      be borne by future generations.<br>

      anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have been reduced. </span>The 
      perturbation of the atmosphere and oceans, resulting from CO<sub>2</sub> 
      already emitted due to human activities since 1750, will persist for centuries 
      because of the slow redistribution of carbon between large ocean and terrestrial 
      reservoirs with slow turnover (see <a href="042.htm#figspm52">Figures 5-2</a> 
      and <a href="043.htm#figspm54">5-4</a>). The future atmospheric concentration 
      of CO<sub>2</sub> is projected to remain for centuries near the highest 
      level reached, since natural processes can only return the concentration 
      to pre-industrial levels over geological time scales. By contrast, stabilization 
      of emissions of shorter lived greenhouse gases such as CH<sub>4</sub> leads, 
      within decades, to stabilization of atmospheric concentrations. Inertia 
      also implies that avoidance of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases 
      has long-lasting benefits.<br>

      (ice caps, ice sheets, glaciers, and permafrost) are the main sources of

      Due to the great mass, thickness, and thermal capacity of the oceans and 
      cryosphere, and the slowness of the heat transport process, linked ocean-climate 
      models predict that the average temperature of the atmosphere near the Earth's 
      surface will take hundreds of years to finally approach the new "equilibrium" 
      temperature following a change in radiative forcing. Penetration of heat 
      from the atmosphere into the upper "mixed layer" of the ocean 
      occurs within decades, but transport of heat into the deep ocean requires 
      centuries. An associated consequence is that human-induced sea-level rise 
      will continue inexorably for many centuries after the atmospheric concentration 
      of greenhouse gases has been stabilized.</td>
