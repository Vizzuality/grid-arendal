        increases in temperature, have already affected and will continue to affect 
        a diverse set of physical and biological systems in many parts of the 
        world.</span> Examples of observed changes include shrinkage of glaciers, 
        reductions in seasonal snow cover, thawing of permafrost, later freezing 
        and earlier break-up of ice on rivers and lakes, loss of Arctic sea ice, 
        lengthening of mid- to high-latitude growing seasons, poleward and altitudinal 
        shifts of plant and animal ranges, changes in the seasonal progression 
        of some plants and animals, declines in some plant and animal populations, 
        and damage to coral reefs. These observed rates of change would be expected 
        to increase in the future represented by any of the SRES scenarios, for 
        which the warming trends for the 21st century are two to ten times those 
        observed for the 20th century. Many physical systems are vulnerable to 
        climate change: For example, the impact of coastal storm surges will be 
        exacerbated by sea-level rise, and glaciers and permafrost will continue 
        to retreat. In some mid- to high latitudes, plant productivity (trees 
        and some agricultural crops) would increase with small increases in temperature. 
        Plant productivity would decrease in most regions of the world for warming 
        beyond a few &ordm;C. In most tropical and subtropical regions, yields 
        are projected to decrease for almost any increase in temperature.<br>

      period 1000 to 1860, observations are shown of variations in average surface 
      temperature of the Northern Hemisphere (corresponding data from the Southern 
      Hemisphere not available) constructed from proxy data (tree rings, corals, 
      ice cores, and historical records). The line shows the 50-year average, 
      and the grey region the 95% confidence limit in the annual data. From the 
      years 1860 to 2000, observations are shown of variations of global and annual 
      averaged surface temperature from the instrumental record. The line shows 
      the decadal average. Over the period 2000 to 2100, projections are shown 
      of globally averaged surface temperature for the six illustrative SRES scenarios 
      and IS92a as estimated by a model with average climate sensitivity. The 
      grey region "several models all SRES envelope" shows the range 
      of results from the full range of 35 SRES scenarios in addition to those 
      from a range of models with different climate sensitivities. <br>

      could have major consequences especially on water and food security and 
      on health. The vulnerability of human societies and natural systems to climate 
      extremes is demonstrated by the damage, hardship, and death caused by events 
      such as droughts, floods, heat waves, avalanches, landslides, and windstorms, 
      which have shown an increasing trend during recent decades. While overall 
      precipitation is projected to increase, there are likely to be much larger 
      changes in intensity and frequency, which will increase the likelihood of 
      extremes of drying and precipitation, and thus droughts and floods during 
      the 21st century. These increases combined with increased water stress (occurring 
      already because of increasing demand) will affect food security and health 
      especially in many developing countries. Conversely, the frequency and magnitude 
      of extreme low-temperature events, such as cold spells, is projected to 
      decrease in the future, with both positive and negative impacts.</td>
