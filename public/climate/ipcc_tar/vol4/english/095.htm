<h1>E. The Identification of a Human Influence on Climate Change</h1>
<a href="082.htm">Sections B</a> and <a href="085.htm">C</a> 
characterised the observed past changes in climate and in forcing agents, respectively. 
<a href="091.htm">Section D</a> examined the capabilities of climate 
models to predict the response of the climate system to such changes in forcing. 
This Section uses that information to examine the question of whether a human 
influence on climate change to date can be identified.<br>
<p>This is an important point to address. The SAR concluded that "the balance 
  of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate". 
  It noted that the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change 
  signals will be accomplished through a gradual accumulation of evidence. The 
  SAR also noted uncertainties in a number of factors, including internal variability 
  and the magnitude and patterns of forcing and response, which prevented them 
  from drawing a stronger conclusion.</p>
<a name="e1"></a> 
<h2>E.1 The Meaning of Detection and Attribution</h2>
<i><b>Detection</b> is the process of demonstrating that an observed change is 
significantly different (in a statistical sense) than can be explained by natural 
variability. <b>Attribution</b> is the process of establishing cause and effect 
with some defined level of confidence, including the assessment of competing hypotheses.</i> 
The response to anthropogenic changes in climate forcing occurs against a backdrop 
of natural internal and externally forced climate variability. Internal climate 
variability, i.e., climate variability not forced by external agents, occurs on 
all time-scales from weeks to centuries and even millennia. Slow climate components, 
such as the ocean, have particularly important roles on decadal and century time-scales 
because they integrate weather variability. Thus, the climate is capable of producing 
long time-scale variations of considerable magnitude without external influences. 
Externally forced climate variations (signals) may be due to changes in natural 
forcing factors, such as solar radiation or volcanic aerosols, or to changes in 
anthropogenic forcing factors, such as increasing concentrations of greenhouse 
gases or aerosols. The presence of this natural climate variability means that 
the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change is a statistical 
"signal to noise" problem. <i>Detection</i> studies demonstrate whether 
or not an observed change is highly unusual in a statistical sense, but this does 
not necessarily imply that we understand its causes. The <i>attribution</i> of 
climate change to anthropogenic causes involves statistical analysis and the careful 
assessment of multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate, within a pre-specified 
margin of error, that the observed changes are: <br>
<ul>
  <li>unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability; 
  <li>consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic 
    and natural forcing; and 
  <li>not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent 
    climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of 
    forcings.

<h2>E.2 A Longer and More Closely Scrutinised Observational Record</h2>

      <b>Figure 14:</b> Global mean surface air temperature anomalies from 1,000 
      year control simulations with three different climate models, - Hadley, 
      Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Hamburg, compared to the recent 
      instrumental record. No model control simulation shows a trend in surface 
      air temperature as large as the observed trend. If internal variability 
      is correct in these models, the recent warming is likely not due to variability 
      produced within the climate system alone. [Based on <a href="../../wg1/445.htm#fig121">Figure

<p><i>Three of the last five years (1995, 1997 and 1998) were the warmest globally 
  in the instrumental record.</i> The impact of observational sampling errors 
  has been estimated for the global and hemispheric mean temperature record. There 
  is also a better understanding of the errors and uncertainties in the satellite-based 
  (Microwave Sounding Unit, MSU) temperature record. Discrepancies between MSU 
  and radiosonde data have largely been resolved, although the observed trend 
  in the difference between the surface and lower tropospheric temperatures cannot 
  fully be accounted for (see <a href="082.htm">Section B</a>). 
  New reconstructions of temperature over the last 1,000 years indicate that the 
  temperature changes over the last hundred years are unlikely to be entirely 
  natural in origin, even taking into account the large uncertainties in palaeo-reconstructions 
  (see <a href="082.htm">Section B</a>).</p>
<a name="e3"></a> 
<h2>E.3 New Model Estimates of Internal Variability</h2>
  
<i>The warming over the past 100 years is very unlikely to be due to internal 
variability alone, as estimated by current models.</i> The instrumental record 
is short and covers the period of human influence and palaeo-records include natural 
forced variations, such as those due to variations in solar irradiance and in 
the frequency of major volcanic eruptions. These limitations leave few alternatives 
to using long "control" simulations with coupled models for the estimation 
of internal climate variability. Since the SAR, more models have been used to 
estimate the magnitude of internal climate variability, a representative sample 
of which is given in <a href="#figTechSum14">Figure 14</a>. As can be seen, there 
is a wide range of global scale internal variability in these models. Estimates 
of the longer time-scale variability relevant to detection and attribution studies 
is uncertain, but, on interannual and decadal time-scales, some models show similar 
or larger variability than observed, even though models do not include variance 
from external sources. Conclusions on detection of an anthropogenic signal are 
insensitive to the model used to estimate internal variability, and recent changes 
cannot be accounted for as pure internal variability, even if the amplitude of 
simulated internal variations is increased by a factor of two or perhaps more. 
Most recent detection and attribution studies find no evidence that model-estimated 
internal variability at the surface is inconsistent with the residual variability 
that remains in the observations after removal of the estimated anthropogenic 
signals on the large spatial and long time-scales used in detection and attribution 
studies. Note, however, the ability to detect inconsistencies is limited. As <a href="#figTechSum14">Figure 
14</a> indicates, no model control simulation shows a trend in surface air temperature 
as large as the observed trend over the last 1,000 years.<br clear="all">
