<h2>3.7. Insurance and Other Financial Services </h2>
<p>The costs of ordinary and extreme weather events have increased rapidly in 
  recent decades. Global economic losses from catastrophic events increased 10.3-fold 
  from 3.9 billion US$ yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1950s to 40 billion US$ yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  in the 1990s (all in 1999US$, unadjusted for purchasing power parity), with 
  approximately one-quarter of the losses occurring in developing countries. The 
  insured portion of these losses rose from a negligible level to 9.2 billion 
  US$ yr<sup>-1</sup> during the same period. Total costs are a factor of two 
  larger when losses from smaller, non-catastrophic weather-related events are 
  included. As a measure of increasing insurance industry vulnerability, the ratio 
  of global property/casual insurance premiums to weather related losses fell 
  by a factor of three between 1985 and 1999. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p>The costs of weather events have risen rapidly despite significant and increasing 
  efforts at fortifying infrastructure and enhancing disaster preparedness. Part 
  of the observed upward trend in disaster losses over the past 50 years is linked 
  to socioeconomic factors, such as population growth, increased wealth, and urbanization 
  in vulnerable areas, and part is linked to climatic factors such as the observed 
  changes in precipitation and flooding events. Precise attribution is complex 
  and there are differences in the balance of these two causes by region and type 
  of event. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p>Climate change and anticipated changes in weather-related events perceived 
  to be linked to climate change would increase actuarial uncertainty in risk 
  assessment (high confidence<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>). 
  Such developments would place upward pressure on insurance premiums and/or could 
  lead to certain risks being reclassified as uninsurable with subsequent withdrawal 
  of coverage. Such changes would trigger increased insurance costs, slow the 
  expansion of financial services into developing countries, reduce the availability 
  of insurance for spreading risk, and increase the demand for government-funded 
  compensation following natural disasters. In the event of such changes, the 
  relative roles of public and private entities in providing insurance and risk 
  management resources can be expected to change. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p>The financial services sector as a whole is expected to be able to cope with 
  the impacts of climate change, although the historic record demonstrates that 
  low-probability high-impact events or multiple closely spaced events severely 
  affect parts of the sector, especially if adaptive capacity happens to be simultaneously 
  depleted by non-climate factors (e.g., adverse financial market conditions). 
  The property/casualty insurance and reinsurance segments and small specialized 
  or undiversified companies have exhibited greater sensitivity, including reduced 
  profitability and bankruptcy triggered by weather-related events. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change presents complex challenges, but also opportunities, 
  to the sector. Regulatory involvement in pricing, tax treatment of reserves, 
  and the (in)ability of firms to withdraw from at-risk markets are examples of 
  factors that influence the resilience of the sector. Public- and private-sector 
  actors also support adaptation by promoting disaster preparedness, loss-prevention 
  programs, building codes, and improved land-use planning. However, in some cases, 
  public insurance and relief programs have inadvertently fostered complacency 
  and maladaptation by inducing development in at-risk areas such as U.S. flood 
  plains and coastal zones. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are expected to be greatest in the developing 
  world, especially in countries reliant on primary production as a major source 
  of income. Some countries experience impacts on their GDP as a consequence of 
  natural disasters, with damages as high as half of GDP in one case. Equity issues 
  and development constraints would arise if weather-related risks become uninsurable, 
  prices increase, or availability becomes limited. Conversely, more extensive 
  access to insurance and more widespread introduction of micro-financing schemes 
  and development banking would increase the ability of developing countries to 
  adapt to climate change. [<a href="139.htm">4.6</a>]</p>
