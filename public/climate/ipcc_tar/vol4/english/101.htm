<i>Climate sensitivity is likely to be in the range of 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C. This 
estimate is unchanged from the first IPCC Assessment Report in 1990 and the SAR.</i> 
The climate sensitivity is the equilibrium response of global surface temperature 
to a doubling of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The range of estimates 
arises from uncertainties in the climate models and their internal feedbacks, 
particularly those related to clouds and related processes. Used for the first 
time in this IPCC report is the Transient Climate Response (TCR). The TCR is defined 
as the globally averaged surface air temperature change, at the time of doubling 
of CO<sub>2</sub>, in a 1%/yr CO<sub>2</sub>-increase experiment. This rate of 
CO<sub>2</sub> increase is assumed to represent the radiative forcing from all 
greenhouse gases. The TCR combines elements of model sensitivity and factors that 
affect response (e.g., ocean heat uptake). The range of the TCR for current AOGCMs 
is 1.1 to 3.1&deg;C.<br>
<p><i>Including the direct effect of sulphate aerosols reduces global mean mid-21st 
  century warming.</i> The surface temperature response pattern for a given model, 
  with and without sulphate aerosols, is more similar than the pattern between 
  two models using the same forcing.</p>
<p><i>Models project changes in several broad-scale climate variables.</i> As 
  the radiative forcing of the climate system changes, the land warms faster and 
  more than the ocean, and there is greater relative warming at high latitudes. 
  Models project a smaller surface air temperature increase in the North Atlantic 
  and circumpolar southern ocean regions relative to the global mean. There is 
  projected to be a decrease in diurnal temperature range in many areas, with 
  night-time lows increasing more than daytime highs. A number of models show 
  a general decrease of daily variability of surface air temperature in winter 
  and increased daily variability in summer in the Northern Hemisphere land areas. 
  As the climate warms, the Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent 
  are projected to decrease. Many of these changes are consistent with recent 
  observational trends, as noted in <a href="082.htm">Section B</a>.</p>
<p><i>Multi-model ensembles of AOGCM simulations for a range of scenarios are 
  being used to quantify the mean climate change and uncertainty based on the 
  range of model results.</i> For the end of the 21st century (2071 to 2100), 
  the mean change in global average surface air temperature, relative to the period 
  1961 to 1990, is 3.0&deg;C (with a range of 1.3 to 4.5&deg;C) for the <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a> 
  draft marker scenario and 2.2&deg;C (with a range of 0.9 to 3.4&deg;C) for the 
  <a href="099.htm#storyb2">B2</a> draft marker scenario. The <a href="099.htm#storyb2">B2</a> 
  scenario produces a smaller warming that is consistent with its lower rate of 
  increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p>
<p><i>On time-scales of a few decades, the current observed rate of warming can 
  be used to constrain the projected response to a given emissions scenario despite 
  uncertainty in climate sensitivity.</i> Analysis of simple models and intercomparisons 
  of AOGCM responses to idealised forcing scenarios suggest that, for most scenarios 
  over the coming decades, errors in large-scale temperature projections are likely 
  to increase in proportion to the magnitude of the overall response. The estimated 
  size of and uncertainty in current observed warming rates attributable to human 
  influence thus provides a relatively model-independent estimate of uncertainty 
  in multi-decade projections under most scenarios. To be consistent with recent 
  observations, anthropogenic warming is likely to lie in the range 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C/decade 
  over the next few decades under the IS92a scenario. This is similar to the range 
  of responses to this scenario based on the seven versions of the simple model 
  used in <a href="#figTechSum22">Figure 22</a>.</p>
<p><i>Most of the features of the geographical response in the SRES scenario experiments 
  are similar for different scenarios (see <a href="#figTechSum20">Figure 20</a>) 
  and are similar to those for idealised 1% CO<sub>2</sub>-increase integrations. 
  </i>The biggest difference between the 1% CO<sub>2</sub>-increase experiments, 
  which have no sulphate aerosol, and the SRES experiments is the regional moderating 
  of the warming over industrialised areas, in the SRES experiments, where the 
  negative forcing from sulphate aerosols is greatest. This regional effect was 
  noted in the SAR for only two models, but this has now been shown to be a consistent 
  response across the greater number of more recent models.</p>
<p><i>It is very likely that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than 
  the global average, particularly those at northern high latitudes in the cold 
  season.</i> Results (see <a href="#figTechSum21">Figure 21</a>) from recent 
  AOGCM simulations forced with SRES <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a> and <a href="099.htm#storyb2">B2</a> 
  emissions scenarios indicate that in winter the warming for all high-latitude 
  northern regions exceeds the global mean warming in each model by more than 
  40% (1.3 to 6.3&deg;C for the range of models and scenarios considered). In 
  summer, warming is in excess of 40% above the global mean change in central 
  and northern Asia. Only in south Asia and southern South America in June/July/ 
  August, and Southeast Asia for both seasons, do the models consistently show 
  warming less than the global average.</p>

<h3>Simple climate model results</h3>
<i>Due to computational expense, AOGCMs can only be run for a limited number of 
scenarios. </i>A simple model can be calibrated to represent globally averaged 
AOGCM responses and run for a much larger number of scenarios.<br>
<p><i>The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 
  to 5.8&deg;C (<a href="#figTechSum22">Figure 22(a)</a>) over the period 1990 
  to 2100.</i> These results are for the full range of 35 SRES scenarios, based 
  on a number of climate models. <sup><small><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>6</a>, 
  <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg1fnts.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>7</a></small></sup>
  Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those in the SAR, which 
  were about 1.0 to 3.5&deg;C based on six IS92 scenarios. The higher projected 
  temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to the lower projected SO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to the IS92 scenarios. The projected 
  rate of warming is much larger than the observed changes during the 20th century 
  and is very likely to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years, 
  based on palaeoclimate data.</p>
<p><i>The relative ranking of the SRES scenarios in terms of global mean temperature 
  changes with time.</i> In particular, for scenarios with higher fossil fuel 
  use (hence, higher carbon dioxide emissions, e.g., <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a>), 
  the SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are also higher. In the near term (to around 2050), 
  the cooling effect of higher sulphur dioxide emissions significantly reduces 
  the warming caused by increased emissions of greenhouse gases in scenarios such 
  as <a href="099.htm#storya2">A2</a>. The opposite effect is seen for scenarios 
  <a href="099.htm#storyb1">B1</a> and <a href="099.htm#storyb2">B2</a>, which 
  have lower fossil fuel emissions as well as lower SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 
  and lead to a larger near-term warming. In the longer term, however, the level 
  of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O 
  become the dominant determinants of the resulting climate changes.</p>
<i>By 2100, differences in emissions in the SRES scenarios and different climate 
model responses contribute similar uncertainty to the range of global temperature 
change.</i> Further uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in the radiative 
forcing. The largest forcing uncertainty is that due to the sulphate aerosols.<br clear="all">
