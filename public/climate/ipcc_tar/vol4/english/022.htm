      (1860-2000, top panel) -- a rise that is unprecedented, at least 
      based on proxy temperature data for the Northern Hemisphere, over the last

      temperature is shown year-by-year (red bars with very likely ranges as
      thin black whiskers)
      and approximately decade-by-decade (continuous red line). Analyses take
      into account data gaps, random instrumental errors and uncertainties, uncertainties
      in bias corrections in the ocean
      surface temperature data, and also in adjustments for urbanization over
      the land. The lower panel merges proxy data (year-by-year blue line with
      very likely ranges as grey band, 50-year-average purple line) and the direct
      temperature measurements (red line) for the Northern Hemisphere. The proxy
      data consist of tree rings, corals, ice cores, and historical records that
      have been calibrated against thermometer data. Insufficient data are available
      to assess such changes in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>

        <em><strong><a name="figspm24"></a>Figure 2-4: Simulating 
        the Earth's temperature variations and comparing the results to 
        the measured changes can provide insight into the underlying causes of 
        the major changes.</strong> A climate model can be used to simulate the 
        temperature changes that occur from both natural and anthropogenic causes. 
        The simulations represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural 
        forcings: solar variation and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by 
        the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases 
        and an estimate of sulfate aerosols. Those encompassed by the band in 
        (c) were done with both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From 
        (b), it can be seen that the inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides 
        a plausible explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature 
        changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is 
        obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors are included. 
        These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain 
        the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other forcings 
        may also have contributed. Similar results to those in (b) are obtained 
        with other models with anthropogenic forcing.<br>

      for the last 1,000 years also indicate that this 20th century warming was 
      unusual and unlikely to be the response to natural forcing alone: That is, 
      volcanic eruptions and variation in solar irradiance do not explain the 
      warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see <a href="#figspm24">Figure

      and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed 
      warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase 
      in greenhouse gas concentrations.</span> Detection and attribution studies 
      (including greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols as anthropogenic forcing) 
      consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record 
      of the last 35 to 50 years, despite uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic 
      sulfate aerosols and natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The 
      sulfate and natural forcings are negative over this period and cannot explain 
      the warming (see <a href="#figspm24">Figure 2-4a</a>); whereas most of these 
      studies find that, over the last 50 years, the estimated rate and magnitude 
      of warming due to increasing greenhouse gases alone are comparable with, 
      or larger than, the observed warming (<a href="#figspm24">Figure 2-4b</a>). 
      The best agreement for the 1860-2000 record is found when the above 
      anthropogenic and natural forcing factors are combined (see <a href="#figspm24">Figure 
      2-4c</a>). This result does not exclude the possibility that other forcings 
      may also contribute, and some known anthopogenic factors (e.g., organic 
      carbon, black carbon (soot), biomass aerosols, and some changes in land 
      use) have not been used in these detection and attribution studies. Estimates 
      of the magnitude and geographic distribution of these additional anthropogenic 
      forcings vary considerably. <br>

      20th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed rise 
      in global average sea level and increase in ocean-heat content.</span> Warming 
      drives sea-level rise through thermal expansion of seawater and widespread 
      loss of land ice. Based on tide gauge records, after correcting for land 
      movements, the average annual rise was between 1 and 2 mm during the 20th 
      century. The very few long records show that it was less during the 19th 
      century (see <a href="023.htm#figspm25">Figure 2-5</a>). Within present 
      uncertainties, observations and models are both consistent with a lack of 
      significant acceleration of sea-level rise during the 20th century. The 
      observed rate of sea-level rise during the 20th century is consistent with 
      models. Global ocean-heat content has increased since the late 1950s, the 
      period with adequate observations of subsurface ocean temperatures.<br>

      the annual duration of lake- and river-ice cover in the mid- and high latitudes 
      of the Northern Hemisphere has been reduced by about 2 weeks over the 20th 
      century. There has also been a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers in 
      non-polar regions during the 20th century. It is likely that Northern Hemisphere 
      spring and summer sea-ice extent has decreased by about 10 to 15% from the 
      1950s to the year 2000 and that Arctic sea-ice thickness has declined by 
      about 40% during late summer and early autumn in the last 3 decades of the 
      20th century. While there is no change in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent 
      from 1978 to 2000 in parallel with global mean surface temperature increase, 
      regional warming in the Antarctic Peninsula coincided with the collapse 
      of the Prince Gustav and parts of the Larsen ice shelves during the 1990s,

      global mean surface temperature is very likely to lead to changes in precipitation 
      and atmospheric moisture because of changes in atmospheric circulation, 
      a more active hydrologic cycle, and increases in the water-holding capacity
