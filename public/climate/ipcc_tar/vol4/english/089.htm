<h2>C.3 Observed and Modelled Changes in Aerosols</h2>
Aerosols (very small airborne particles and droplets) are known to influence significantly 
the radiative budget of the Earth/atmosphere. Aerosol radiative effects occur 
in two distinct ways: (i) the direct effect, whereby aerosols themselves scatter 
and absorb solar and thermal infrared radiation, and (ii) the indirect effect, 
whereby aerosols modify the microphysical and hence the radiative properties and 
amount of clouds. Aerosols are produced by a variety of processes, both natural 
(including dust storms and volcanic activity) and anthropogenic (including fossil 
fuel and biomass burning). The atmospheric concentrations of tropospheric aerosols 
are thought to have increased over recent years due to increased anthropogenic 
emissions of particles and their precursor gases, hence giving rise to radiative 
forcing. Most aerosols are found in the lower troposphere (below a few kilometres), 
but the radiative effect of many aerosols is sensitive to the vertical distribution. 
Aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the atmosphere, notably 
within clouds, and are removed largely and relatively rapidly by precipitation 
(typically within a week). Because of this short residence time and the inhomogeneity 
of sources, aerosols are distributed inhomogeneously in the troposphere, with 
maxima near the sources. The radiative forcing due to aerosols depends not only 
on these spatial distributions, but also on the size, shape, and chemical composition 
of the particles and various aspects (e.g., cloud formation) of the hydrological 
cycle as well. As a result of all of these factors, obtaining accurate estimates 
of this forcing has been very challenging, from both the observational and theoretical 
standpoints.<br>
<p><i>Nevertheless, substantial progress has been achieved in better defining 
  the <b>direct effect</b> of a wider set of different aerosols.</i> The SAR considered 
  the direct effects of only three anthropogenic aerosol species: sulphate aerosols, 
  biomass-burning aerosols, and fossil fuel black carbon (or soot). Observations 
  have now shown the importance of organic materials in both fossil fuel carbon 
  aerosols and biomass-burning carbon aerosols. Since the SAR, the inclusion of 
  estimates for the abundance of fossil fuel organic carbon aerosols has led to 
  an increase in the predicted total optical depth (and consequent negative forcing) 
  associated with industrial aerosols. Advances in observations and in aerosol 
  and radiative models have allowed quantitative estimates of these separate components, 
  as well as an estimate for the range of radiative forcing associated with mineral 
  dust, as shown in <a href="085.htm#FigTechSum9">Figure 9</a>. Direct radiative 
  forcing is estimated to be -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for sulphate, -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  for biomass-burning aerosols, -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel organic carbon, 
  and +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. Uncertainties 
  remain relatively large, however. These arise from difficulties in determining 
  the concentration and radiative characteristics of atmospheric aerosols and 
  the fraction of the aerosols that are of anthropogenic origin, particularly 
  the knowledge of the sources of carbonaceous aerosols. This leads to considerable 
  differences (i.e., factor of two to three range) in the burden and substantial 
  differences in the vertical distribution (factor of ten). Anthropogenic dust 
  aerosol is also poorly quantified. Satellite observations, combined with model 
  calculations, are enabling the identification of the spatial signature of the 
  total aerosol radiative effect in clear skies; however, the quantitative amount 
  is still uncertain.</p>
<p><i>Estimates of the <b>indirect radiative</b> forcing by anthropogenic aerosols 
  remain problematic, although observational evidence points to a negative aerosol-induced 
  indirect forcing in warm clouds.</i> Two different approaches exist for estimating 
  the indirect effect of aerosols: empirical methods and mechanistic methods. 
  The former have been applied to estimate the effects of industrial aerosols, 
  while the latter have been applied to estimate the effects of sulphate, fossil 
  fuel carbonaceous aerosols, and biomass aerosols. In addition, models for the 
  indirect effect have been used to estimate the effects of the initial change 
  in droplet size and concentrations (a first indirect effect), as well as the 
  effects of the subsequent change in precipitation efficiency (a second indirect 
  effect). The studies represented in <a href="085.htm#FigTechSum9">Figure 9</a> 
  provide an expert judgement for the range of the first of these; the range is 
  now slightly wider than in the SAR; the radiative perturbation associated with 
  the second indirect effect is of the same sign and could be of similar magnitude 
  compared to the first effect.</p>
<p><i>The indirect radiative effect of aerosols is now understood to also encompass 
  effects on ice and mixed-phase clouds, but the magnitude of any such indirect 
  effect is not known, although it is likely to be positive.</i> It is not possible 
  to estimate the number of anthropogenic ice nuclei at the present time. Except 
  at cold temperatures (below -45&deg;C) where homogeneous nucleation is expected 
  to dominate, the mechanisms of ice formation in these clouds are not yet known.<a name="c4"></a> 
</p>
<h2>C.4 Observed Changes in Other Anthropogenic Forcing Agents Land-use (albedo) 
  change</h2>
<i>Changes in land use, deforestation being the major factor, appear to have produced 
a negative radiative forcing of -0.2 &plusmn; 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (<a href="085.htm#FigTechSum8">Figure 
8</a>).</i> The largest effect is estimated to be at the high latitudes. This 
is because deforestation has caused snow-covered forests with relatively low albedo 
to be replaced with open, snow-covered areas with higher albedo. The estimate 
given above is based on simulations in which pre-industrial vegetation is replaced 
by current land-use patterns. However, the level of understanding is very low 
for this forcing, and there have been far fewer investigations of this forcing 
compared to investigations of other factors considered in this report. <br>
