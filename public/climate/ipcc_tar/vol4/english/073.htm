      <p><span class="blue2">Studies examined in the TAR suggest substantial
          technological and other opportunities for lowering mitigation costs.
          National mitigation
        responses to climate change can be more effective if deployed as a portfolio
          of policy
        instruments to limit or reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. </span>The
        costs of mitigation are strongly affected by development paths, with
        those
        paths involving substantial increases in greenhouse gas emissions requiring
        more mitigation to reach a stabilization target, and hence higher costs.
        These costs can be substantially reduced or even turned into net
        benefits with a portfolio of policy instruments (including those that
        help to overcome barriers) to the extent that policies can exploit "no-regrets" 
      opportunities in the following areas: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Technological options: </em>Technological options may achieve 
          global emissions reductions of 1.9 to 2.6 Gt C<sub>eq</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> 
          by year 2010 and 3.6 to 5.0 Gt C<sub>eq</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> by year 
          2020. Half of these reductions may be realized with one component of 
          their economic cost (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs) 
          with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, and the other half with 
          that component of their economic cost ranging from US$0 to US$100 per 
          t C<sub>eq</sub>. <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnsyn.htm#26","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>26</sup></small></a> 
          Depending on the emissions scenario, global emissions could be reduced 
          below year 2000 levels over the 2010 to 2020 time frame. <b><em>Key 
          uncertainties</em></b> are the identification, extent, and nature of 
          any barriers that impede adoption of promising low-emission technologies, 
          and the estimation of the costs of overcoming the barriers.</li>
        <li><em>Ancillary benefits: </em>Depending on factors (such as location 
          of the greenhouse gas emissions, the prevailing local climate, and the 
          population density, composition, and health) the magnitude of the ancillary 
          benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the mitigating 
          policies and measures. <b><em>Key uncertainties</em></b> are the magnitude 
          and location of these benefits involving the scientific assessment and 
          valuation of health risks of air pollution, particularly those involving 
          fine aerosols and particles. </li>
        <li><em>Double dividends: </em>Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned 
          permits) provide revenues to the government. If used to finance reductions 
          in existing distortionary taxes ("revenue recycling"), these 
          revenues reduce the economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions. 
          The magnitude of this offset depends on the existing tax structure, 
          type of tax cuts, labor market conditions, and method of recycling. 
          Under some circumstances, it is possible that the economic benefits 
          may exceed the costs of mitigation. <b><em>Key uncertainties</em></b> 
          regarding the overall net costs of mitigation vary between countries, 
          depending on the existing tax structure, the extent of the distortion, 
          and the type of tax cuts that are acceptable.<br>

        </span>Global modeling studies, with results depending strongly upon assumptions, 
        project that costs of mitigation based on Kyoto targets are likely to 
        be reduced by full carbon-permit trading within the Annex B<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnsyn.htm#27","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>27</sup></small></a>

        countries</em> may expect aggregate costs to be reduced by about half 
        through full permit trading. <em>Annex I economies in transition</em> 
        are projected to be unaffected or to gain several percent increase in 
        GDP. <em>Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries</em> may also expect similar 
        reductions in costs under such trading. The aggregate effects of trading 
        are expected to be positive for <em>other non-Annex I countries</em>. 
        Those countries that may expect a loss or gain without Annex I trading 
        may expect a smaller change with trading. A <strong><em>key uncertainty</em> 
        </strong>is the extent of the underlying costs, which vary widely across 
        countries, and how these cost estimates will be changed (a) when methods 
        are improved and (b) when some of the assumptions of the models are relaxed. 
        Such assumptions are concerned with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allowance for exemptions in the emission-permit trading in concert 
          with other policies and measures</li>
        <li>Consideration of various market imperfections</li>
        <li>Allowance for induced technical change</li>
        <li>Inclusion of ancillary benefits</li>
        <li>Opportunities for double dividends</li>
        <li>Inclusion of policies for non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases and 
          non-energy sources of all greenhouse gases (e.g., CH<sub>4</sub> from 
          agriculture)</li>
        <li>Offsets from sinks.</li>
