        issues, and their relationship to meeting human needs, offer opportunities 
        to capture synergies in developing response options and reducing vulnerabilities 
        to climate change, although trade-offs between issues may exist.</span> 
        Multiple environmental and development goals can be achieved by adopting 
        a broad range of technologies, policies, and measures that explicitly 
        recognize the inextricable linkages among environmental problems and human 
        needs. Addressing the need for energy, while reducing local and regional 
        air pollution and global climate change cost-effectively, requires an 
        interdisciplinary assessment of the synergies and trade-offs of meeting 
        energy requirements in the most economically, environmentally, and socially 
        sustainable manner. Greenhouse gas emissions, as well as local and regional 
        pollutants, could be reduced through more efficient use of energy and 
        increasing the share of lower carbon-emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil-fuel 
        technologies (e.g., highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines, fuel 
        cells, and combined heat and power) and renewable energy technologies 
        (e.g., increased use of environmentally sound biofuels, hydropower, solar, 
        wind- and wave-power). Further, the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations 
        in the atmosphere can be reduced also by enhanced uptake of carbon through, 
        for example, afforestation, reforestation, slowing deforestation, and 
        improved forest, rangeland, wetland, and cropland management, which can 
        have favorable effects on biodiversity, food production, land, and water 
        resources. Reducing vulnerability to climate change can often reduce vulnerability 
        to other environmental stresses and <em>vice versa</em>. In some cases 
        there will be trade-offs. For example, in some implementations, monoculture 
        plantations could decrease local biodiversity.</p>

      obligations. For example, although different, the Vienna Convention for 
      the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the United Nations Framework Convention 
      on Climate Change are scientifically interrelated because many of the compounds 
      that cause depletion of the ozone layer are also important greenhouse gases
