<h1>5. Regional Analysis </h1>
<p>The vulnerability of human populations and natural systems to climate change 
  differs substantially across regions and across populations within regions. 
  Regional differences in baseline climate and expected climate change give rise 
  to different exposures to climate stimuli across regions. The natural and social 
  systems of different regions have varied characteristics, resources, and institutions 
  and are subject to varied pressures that give rise to differences in sensitivity 
  and adaptive capacity. From these differences emerge different key concerns 
  for each of the major regions of the world. Even within regions, however, impacts, 
  adaptive capacity, and vulnerability will vary. Because available studies have 
  not employed a common set of climate scenarios and methods and because of uncertainties 
  regarding the sensitivities and adaptability of natural and social systems, 
  assessment of regional vulnerabilities is necessarily qualitative.</p>

<p><a name="figts6"></a><i>Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change.</i> 
  Impacts of particular concern to Africa are related to water resources, food 
  production, human health, desertification, and coastal zones, especially in 
  relation to extreme events. A synergy of land-use and climate change will exacerbate 
  desertification. Selected key impacts in Africa are highlighted in <a href="#figts6">Figure 
  TS-6</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="511"></a>5.1.1. Water Resources </h3>
<p><i>Water resources are a key area of vulnerability in Africa, affecting water 
  supply for household use, agriculture, and industry. In shared river basins, 
  regional cooperation protocols minimize adverse impacts and potential for conflicts.</i> 
  Trends in regional per capita water availability in Africa over the past half 
  century show that water availability has diminished by 75%. Although the past 
  2 decades have experienced reductions in river flows, especially in sub-Saharan 
  West Africa, the trend mainly reflects the impact of population growth -- which, 
  for most countries, quadrupled in the same period. Population growth and degradation 
  of water quality are significant threats to water security in many parts of 
  Africa, and the combination of continued population increases and global warming 
  impacts is likely to accentuate water scarcity in subhumid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>Africa is the continent with the lowest conversion factor of precipitation 
  to runoff, averaging 15%. Although the equatorial region and coastal areas of 
  eastern and southern Africa are humid, the rest of the continent is dry subhumid 
  to arid. The dominant impact of global warming will be a reduction in soil moisture 
  in subhumid zones and a reduction in runoff. Current trends in major river basins 
  indicate decreasing runoff of about 17% over the past decade. </p>
<p>Most of Africa has invested significantly in hydroelectric power facilities 
  to underpin economic development. Reservoir storage shows marked sensitivity 
  to variations in runoff and periods of drought. Lake storage and major dams 
  have reached critical levels, threatening industrial activity. Model results 
  and some reservoirs and lakes indicate that global warming will increase the 
  frequency of such low storage as a result of flooding or drought conditions 
  that are related to ENSO. [<a href="../../wg2/383.htm">10.2.1</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="512"></a>5.1.2. Food Security</h3>
<p><i>There is wide consensus that climate change will worsen food security, mainly 
  through increased extremes and temporal/ spatial shifts.</i> The continent already 
  experiences a major deficit in food production in many areas, and potential 
  declines in soil moisture will be an added burden. Food-insecure countries are 
  at a greater risk of adverse impacts of climate change. Inland and marine fisheries 
  provide a significant contribution to protein intake in many African countries. 
  As a result of water stress and land degradation, inland fisheries will be rendered 
  more vulnerable to episodic drought and habitat destruction. Ocean warming is 
  likely to impact coastal marine fisheries. [<a href="../../wg2/387.htm">10.2.2</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="513"></a>5.1.3. Natural Resource Management and Biodiversity</h3>
<p><i>Irreversible losses of biodiversity could be accelerated with climate change.</i> 
  Climate change is expected to lead to drastic shifts of biodiversity-rich biomes 
  such as the Succulent Karoo in South Africa and many losses in species in other 
  biomes. Changes in the frequency, intensity, and extent of vegetation fires 
  and habitat modification from land-use change may negate natural adaptive processes 
  and lead to extinctions. Changes in ecosystems will affect water supply, fuelwood, 
  and other services. [<a href="../../wg2/394.htm">10.2.3.2</a>]</p>
