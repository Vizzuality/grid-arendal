<h2>D.2 The Coupled Systems</h2>
As noted in <a href="092.htm#d1">Section D.1</a>, many feedbacks operate within 
the individual components of the climate system (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere 
and land surface). However, many important processes and feedbacks occur through 
the coupling of the climate system components. Their representation is important 
to the prediction of large-scale responses.<br>
<a name="modes"></a> 
<h3>Modes of natural variability</h3>
<i>There is an increasing realisation that natural circulation patterns, such 
as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in global climate and its interannual 
and longer-term variability.</i> The strongest natural fluctuation of climate 
on interannual time-scales is the ENSO phenomenon (see <a href="092.htm#box4">Box 
4</a>). It is an inherently coupled atmosphere-ocean mode with its core activity 
in the tropical Pacific, but with important regional climate impacts throughout 
the world. Global climate models are only now beginning to exhibit variability 
in the tropical Pacific that resembles ENSO, mainly through increased meridional 
resolution at the equator. Patterns of sea surface temperature and atmospheric 
circulation similar to those occurring during ENSO on interannual time-scales 
also occur on decadal and longer time-scales.<br>
<p><i>The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern of northern 
  wintertime atmospheric circulation variability and is increasingly being simulated 
  realistically.</i> The NAO is closely related to the Arctic Oscillation (AO), 
  which has an additional annular component around the Arctic. There is strong 
  evidence that the NAO arises mainly from internal atmospheric processes involving 
  the entire troposphere-stratosphere system. Fluctuations in Atlantic Sea Surface 
  Temperatures (SSTs) are related to the strength of the NAO, and a modest two-way 
  interaction between the NAO and the Atlantic Ocean, leading to decadal variability, 
  is emerging as important in projecting climate change.</p>
<p><i>Climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means, as well as changing 
  preference of specific climate regimes, as evidenced by the observed trend toward 
  positive values for the last 30 years in the NAO index and the climate "shift" 
  in the tropical Pacific about 1976.</i> While coupled models simulate features 
  of observed natural climate variability, such as the NAO and ENSO, which suggests 
  that many of the relevant processes are included in the models, further progress 
  is needed to depict these natural modes accurately. Moreover, because ENSO and 
  NAO are key determinants of regional climate change and can possibly result 
  in abrupt and counter intuitive changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty 
  in those aspects of climate change that critically depend on regional changes.</p>
<a name="thermohaline"></a> 
<h3>The thermohaline circulation (THC)</h3>
<i>The thermohaline circulation (THC) is responsible for the major part of the 
meridional heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean.</i> The THC is a global-scale 
overturning in the ocean driven by density differences arising from temperature 
and salinity effects. In the Atlantic, heat is transported by warm surface waters 
flowing northward and cold saline waters from the North Atlantic returning at 
depth. Reorganisations in the Atlantic THC can be triggered by perturbations in 
the surface buoyancy, which is influenced by precipitation, evaporation, continental 
runoff, sea-ice formation, and the exchange of heat, processes that could all 
change with consequences for regional and global climate. Interactions between 
the atmosphere and the ocean are also likely to be of considerable importance 
on decadal and longer time-scales, where the THC is involved. The interplay between 
the large-scale atmospheric forcing, with warming and evaporation in low latitudes 
and cooling and increased precipitation at high latitudes, forms the basis of 
a potential instability of the present Atlantic THC. ENSO may also influence the 
Atlantic THC by altering the fresh water balance of the tropical Atlantic, therefore 
providing a coupling between low and high latitudes. Uncertainties in the representation 
of small-scale flows over sills and through narrow straits and of ocean convection 
limit the ability of models to simulate situations involving substantial changes 
in the THC. The less saline North Pacific means that a deep THC does not occur 
in the Pacific.<br>
<a name="non-linear"></a> 
<h3>Non-linear events and rapid climate change</h3>
<p><i>The possibility for rapid and irreversible changes in the climate system 
  exists, but there is a large degree of uncertainty about the mechanisms involved 
  and hence also about the likelihood or time-scales of such transitions.</i> 
  The climate system involves many processes and feedbacks that interact in complex 
  non-linear ways. This interaction can give rise to thresholds in the climate 
  system that can be crossed if the system is perturbed sufficiently. There is 
  evidence from polar ice cores suggesting that atmospheric regimes can change 
  within a few years and that large-scale hemispheric changes can evolve as fast 
  as a few decades. For example, the possibility of a threshold for a rapid transition 
  of the Atlantic THC to a collapsed state has been demonstrated with a hierarchy 
  of models. It is not yet clear what this threshold is and how likely it is that 
  human activity would lead it to being exceeded (see <a href="103.htm#f6">Section 
  F.6</a>). Atmospheric circulation can be characterised by different preferred 
  patterns; e.g., arising from ENSO and the NAO/AO, and changes in their phase 
  can occur rapidly. Basic theory and models suggest that climate change may be 
  first expressed in changes in the frequency of occurrence of these patterns. 
  Changes in vegetation, through either direct anthropogenic deforestation or 
  those caused by global warming, could occur rapidly and could induce further 
  climate change. It is supposed that the rapid creation of the Sahara about 5,500 
  years ago represents an example of such a non-linear change in land cover.<br>

<h2>D.3 Regionalisation Techniques</h2>
  
<i>Regional climate information was only addressed to a limited degree in the 
SAR. Techniques used to enhance regional detail have been substantially improved 
since the SAR and have become more widely applied. </i>They fall into three categories: 
high and variable resolution AOGCMs; regional (or nested limited area) climate 
models (RCMs); and empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods. The 
techniques exhibit different strengths and weaknesses and their use at the continental 
scale strongly depends on the needs of specific applications.<br>
<p><i>Coarse resolution AOGCMs simulate atmospheric general circulation features 
  well in general.</i> At the regional scale, the models display area-average 
  biases that are highly variable from region to region and among models, with 
  sub-continental area averaged seasonal temperature biases typically &plusmn;4&ordm;C 
  and precipitation biases between -40 and +80%. These represent an important 
  improvement compared to AOGCMs evaluated in the SAR.</p>
<p><i>The development of high resolution/variable resolution Atmospheric General 
  Circulation Models (AGCMs) since the SAR generally shows that the dynamics and 
  large-scale flow in the models improves as resolution increases.</i> In some 
  cases, however, systematic errors are worsened compared to coarser resolution 
  models, although only very few results have been documented.</p>
<p><i>High resolution RCMs have matured considerably since the SAR.</i> Regional 
  models consistently improve the spatial detail of simulated climate compared 
  to AGCMs. RCMs driven by observed boundary conditions evidence area-averaged 
  temperature biases (regional scales of 105 to 106 km<sup>2</sup>) generally 
  below 2&ordm;C, while precipitation biases are below 50%. Regionalisation work 
  indicates at finer scales that the changes can be substantially different in 
  magnitude or sign from the large area-average results. A relatively large spread 
  exists among models, although attribution of the cause of these differences 
  is unclear.</p>
