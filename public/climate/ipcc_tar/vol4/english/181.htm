<h2><a name="52"></a>5.2 Sources of Barriers and Opportunities</h2>
<p>Technological and social innovation is a complex process of research, experimentation, 
  learning, and development that can contribute to GHG mitigation. Several theories 
  and models have been developed to understand its features, drivers, and implications. 
  New knowledge and human capital may result from R&amp;D spending, through learning 
  by doing, and/or in an evolutionary process. Most innovations require some social 
  or behavioural change on the part of users. Rapidly changing economies, as well 
  as social and institutional structures offer opportunities for locking in to 
  GHG-mitigative technologies that may lead countries on to sustainable development 
  pathways. The pathways will be influenced by the particular socio-economic context 
  that reflects prices, financing, international trade, market structure, institutions, 
  the provision of information, and social, cultural, and behavioural factors; 
  key elements of these are described below.</p>
<p><i>Unstable macroeconomic conditions</i> increase risk to private investment 
  and finance. Unsound government borrowing and fiscal policy lead to chronic 
  public deficits and low liquidity in the private sector. Governments may also 
  create perverse microeconomic incentives that the encourage rent-seeking and 
  corruption, rather than the efficient use of resources. Trade barriers that 
  favour inefficient technologies, or prevent access to foreign technology, slow 
  technology diffusion. Tied aid still dominates in official development assistance. 
  It distorts the efficiency of technology choice, and may crowd-out viable business 
  models. </p>

        a conceptual framework.<br>
      </p>
    </td>

</table>
<p><i><a name="figTS7"></a>Commercial financing institutions</i> face high risks 
  with developing "green" financial products. Environmentally sound 
  technologies with relatively small project sizes and long repayment periods 
  deter banks with their high transaction costs. Small collateral value makes 
  it difficult to use financing instruments, such as project finance. Innovative 
  approaches in the private sector to address these issues include leasing, environmental 
  and ethical banks, micro-credits or small grants facilities targetted at low 
  income households, environmental funds, energy service companies (ESCOs), and 
  green venture capital. The insurance industry has already begun to react to 
  risks of climate change. New green financial institutions, such as forestry 
  investment funds, have tapped market opportunities by working towards capturing 
  values of standing forests. </p>
<p><i>Distorted or incomplete prices</i> are also important barriers. The absence 
  of a market price for certain impacts (externalities), such as environmental 
  harm, constitutes a barrier to the diffusion of environmentally beneficial technologies. 
  Distortion of prices because of taxes, subsidies, or other policy interventions 
  that make resource consumption more or less expensive to consumers also impedes 
  the diffusion of resource-conserving technologies.</p>
<p><i>Network externalities</i> can generate barriers. Some technologies operate 
  in such a way that a given user's equipment interacts with the equipment 
  of other users so as to create "network externalities". For example, 
  the attractiveness of vehicles using alternative fuels depends on the availability 
  of convenient refuelling sites. On the other hand, the development of a fuel 
  distribution infrastructure depends on there being a demand for alternative 
  fuel vehicles. </p>
<p><i>Misplaced incentives</i> result between landlords and tenants when the tenant 
  is responsible for the monthly cost of fuel and/or electricity, and the landlord 
  is prone to provide the cheapest-first-cost equipment without regard to its 
  monthly energy use. Similar problems are encountered when vehicles are purchased 
  by companies for the use of their employees.</p>
<p><i>Vested interests:</i> A major barrier to the diffusion of technical progress 
  lies in the vested interests who specialize in conventional technologies and 
  who may, therefore, be tempted to collude and exert political pressure on governments 
  to impose administrative procedures, taxes, trade barriers, and regulations 
  in order to delay or even prevent the arrival of new innovations that might 
  destroy their rents.</p>
<p><i>Lack of effective regulatory agencies</i> impedes the introduction of environmentally 
  sound technologies. Many countries have excellent constitutional and legal provisions 
  for environmental protection but the latter are not enforced. However, "informal 
  regulation" under community pressure from, for example, non-governmental 
  organizations (NGOs), trade unions, neighbourhood organizations, etc. may substitute 
  for formal regulatory pressure. </p>
<p><i>Information</i> is often considered as a public good. Generic information 
  regarding the availability of different kinds of technologies and their performance 
  characteristics may have the attributes of a "public good" and hence 
  may be underprovided by the private market. This problem is exacerbated by the 
  fact that even after a technology is in place and being used, it is often difficult 
  to quantify the energy savings that resulted from its installation owing to 
  measurement errors and the difficulty with baseline problems. Knowing that this 
  uncertainty will prevail can itself inhibit technology diffusion.</p>
<p><i>Current lifestyles, behaviours, and consumption patterns</i> have developed 
  within current and historical socio-cultural contexts. Changes in behaviour 
  and lifestyles may result from a number of intertwined processes, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>scientific, technological, and economic developments;</li>
  <li>developments in dominant world views and public discourse;</li>
  <li>changes in the relationships among institutions, political alliances, or 
    actor networks;</li>
  <li>changes in social structures or relationships within firms and households; 
    and</li>
  <li>changes in psychological motivation (e.g., convenience, social prestige, 
    career, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Barriers take various forms in association with each of the above processes. 
</p>
<p>In some situations policy development is based on a model of human psychology 
  that has been widely criticized. People are assumed to be rational welfare-maximizers 
  and to have a fixed set of values. Such a model does not explain processes, 
  such as learning, habituation, value formation, or the bounded rationality, 
  observed in human choice. Social structures can affect consumption, for example, 
  through the association of objects with status and class. Individuals' 
  adoption of more sustainable consumption patterns depends not only on the match 
  between those patterns and their perceived needs, but also on the extent to 
  which they understand their consumption options, and are able to make choices. 
  <br>
</p>
<p><i>Uncertainty</i><b><i>: </i></b></p>
<p>Another important barrier is uncertainty. A consumer may be uncertain about 
  future energy prices and, therefore, future energy savings. Also, there may 
  be uncertainty about the next generation of equipment - will next year 
  bring a cheaper or better model? In practical decision making, a barrier is 
  often associated with the issue of sunk cost and long lifetimes of infrastructure, 
  and the associated irreversibilities of investments of the non-fungible infrastructure 
  capita.</p>
