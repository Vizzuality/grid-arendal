<h2><a name="103"></a>10.3 Linkages to National and Local Sustainable Development 
  Choices</h2>
<p>Much of the ambiguity related to sustainable development and climate change 
  arises from the lack of measurements that could provide policymakers with essential 
  information on the alternative choices at stake, how those choices affect clear 
  and recognizable social, economic, and environmental critical issues, and also 
  provide a basis for evaluating their performance in achieving goals and targets. 
  Therefore, indicators are indispensable to make the concept of sustainable development 
  operational. At the national level important steps in the direction of defining 
  and designing different sets of indicators have been undertaken; however, much 
  work remains to be done to translate sustainability objectives into practical 
  terms.</p>
<p>It is difficult to generalize about sustainable development policies and choices. 
  Sustainability implies and requires diversity, flexibility, and innovation. 
  Policy choices are meant to introduce changes in technological patterns of natural 
  resource use, production and consumption, structural changes in the production 
  systems, spatial distribution of population and economic activities, and behavioural 
  patterns. Climate change literature has by and large addressed the first three 
  topics, while the relevance of choices and decisions related to behavioural 
  patterns and lifestyles has been paid scant attention. Consumption patterns 
  in the industrialized countries are an important reason for climate change. 
  If people changed their preferences this could alleviate climate change considerably. 
  To change consumption patterns, however, people must not only change their behaviour 
  but also change themselves because these patterns are an essential element of 
  lifestyles and, therefore, of self-esteem. Yet, apart from climate change there 
  are other reasons to do so as well as indications that this change can be fostered 
  politically. </p>
<p>A critical requirement of sustainable development is a capacity to design policy 
  measures that, without hindering development and consistent with national strategies, 
  could exploit potential synergies between national economic growth objectives 
  and environmentally focused policies. Climate change mitigation strategies offer 
  a clear example of how co-ordinated and harmonized policies can take advantage 
  of the synergies between the implementation of mitigation options and broader 
  objectives. Energy efficiency improvements, including energy conservation, switch 
  to low carbon content fuels, use of renewable energy sources and the introduction 
  of more advanced non conventional energy technologies, are expected to have 
  significant impacts on curbing actual GHG emission tendencies. Similarly, the 
  adoption of new technologies and practices in agriculture and forestry activities 
  as well as the adoption of clean production processes could make substantial 
  contributions to the GHG mitigation effort. Depending on the specific context 
  in which they are applied, these options may entail positive side effects or 
  double dividends, which in some cases are worth undertaking whether or not there 
  are climate-related reasons for doing so. </p>
<p>Sustainable development requires radical technological and related changes 
  in both developed and developing countries. Technological innovation and the 
  rapid and widespread transfer and implementation of individual technological 
  options and choices, as well as overall technological systems, constitute major 
  elements of global strategies to achieve both climate stabilization and sustainable 
  development. However, technology transfer requires more than technology itself. 
  An enabling environment for the successful transfer and implementation of technology 
  plays a crucial role, particularly in developing countries. If technology transfer 
  is to bring about economic and social benefits it must take into account the 
  local cultural traditions and capacities as well as the institutional and organizational 
  circumstances required to handle, operate, replicate, and improve the technology 
  on a continuous basis. </p>
<p>The process of integrating and internalizing climate change and sustainable 
  development policies into national development agendas requires new problem 
  solving strategies and decision-making approaches. This task implies a twofold 
  effort. On one hand, sustainable development discourse needs greater analytical 
  and intellectual rigor (methods, indicators, etc.) to make this concept advance 
  from theory to practice. On the other hand, climate change discourse needs to 
  be aware of both the restrictive set of assumptions underlying the tools and 
  methods applied in the analysis, and the social and political implications of 
  scientific constructions of climate change. Over recent years a good deal of 
  analytical work has addressed the problem in both directions. Various approaches 
  have been explored to transcend the limits of the standard views and decision 
  frameworks in dealing with issues of uncertainty, complexity, and the contextual 
  influences of human valuation and decision making. A common theme emerges: the 
  emphasis on participatory decision making frameworks for articulating new institutional 
  arrangements.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="104"></a>10.4 Key Policy-relevant Scientific Questions</h2>
<p>Different levels of globally agreed limits for climate change (or for corresponding 
  atmospheric GHG concentrations), entail different balances of mitigation costs 
  and net damages for individual nations. Considering the uncertainties involved 
  and future learning, climate stabilization will inevitably be an iterative process: 
  nation states determine their own national targets based on their own exposure 
  and their sensitivity to other countries' exposure to climate change. The 
  global target emerges from consolidating national targets, possibly involving 
  side payments, in global negotiations. Simultaneously, agreement on burden sharing 
  and the agreed global target determines national costs. Compared to the expected 
  net damages associated with the global target, nation states might reconsider 
  their own national targets, especially as new information becomes available 
  on global and regional patterns and impacts of climate change. This is then 
  the starting point for the next round of negotiations. It follows from the above 
  that establishing the "magic number" (<i>i.e.</i>, the upper limit for global 
  climate change or GHG concentration in the atmosphere) will be a long process 
  and its source will primarily be the policy process, hopefully helped by improving 
  science.</p>
<p>Looking at the key dilemmas in climate change decision making, the following 
  conclusions emerge (see also <a href="201.htm">Table TS.7</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>a carefully crafted portfolio of mitigation, adaptation, and learning activities 
    appears to be appropriate over the next few decades to hedge against the risk 
    of intolerable magnitudes and/or rates of climate change (impact side) and 
    against the need to undertake painfully drastic emission reductions if the 
    resolution of uncertainties reveals that climate change and its impacts might 
    imply high risks;</li>
  <li>emission reduction is an important form of mitigation, but the mitigation 
    portfolio includes a broad range of other activities, including investments 
    to develop low-cost non-carbon, energy efficient and carbon management technologies 
    that will make future CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation less expensive;</li>
  <li>timing and composition of mitigation measures (investment into technological 
    development or immediate emission reductions) is highly controversial because 
    of the technological features of energy systems, and the range of uncertainties 
    involved in the impacts of different emission paths;</li>
  <li>international flexibility instruments help reduce the costs of emission 
    reductions, but they raise a series of implementation and verification issues 
    that need to be balanced against the cost savings;</li>
  <li>while there is a broad consensus to use the Pareto optimality<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg3fnts.htm#30","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>30</a></sup></small> 
    as the efficiency principle, there is no agreement on the best equity principle 
    on wich to build an equitable international regime. Efficiency and equity 
    are important concerns in negotiating emission limitation schemes, and they 
    are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, equity will play an important role 
    in determining the distribution of emissions allowances and/or within compensation 
    schemes following emission trading that could lead to a disproportionately 
    high level of burden on certain countries. Finally, it could be more important 
    to build a regime on the combined implications of the various equity principles 
    rather than to select any one particular equity principle. Diffusing non-carbon, 
    energy-efficient, as well as other GHG reducing technologies worldwide could 
    make a significant contribution to reducing emissions over the short term, 
    but many barriers hamper technology transfer, including market imperfections, 
    political problems, and the often-neglected transaction costs;</li>
  <li>some obvious linkages exist between current global and continental environmental 
    problems and attempts of the international community to resolve them, but 
    the potential synergies of jointly tackling several of them have not yet been 
    thoroughly explored, let alone exploited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigation and adaptation decisions related to anthropogenically induced climate 
  change differ. Mitigation decisions involve many countries, disperse benefits 
  globally over decades to centuries (with some near-term ancillary benefits), 
  are driven by public policy action, based on information available today, and 
  the relevant regulation will require rigorous enforcement. In contrast, adaptation 
  decisions involve a shorter time span between outlays and returns, related costs 
  and benefits accrue locally, and their implementation involves local public 
  policies and private adaptation of the affected social agents, both based on 
  improving information. Local mitigation and adaptive capacities vary significantly 
  across regions and over time. A portfolio of mitigation and adaptation policies 
  will depend on local or national priorities and preferred approaches in combination 
  with international responsibilities.</p>
<p>Given the large uncertainties characterizing each component of the climate 
  change problem, it is difficult for decision makers to establish a globally 
  acceptable level of stabilizing GHG concentrations today. Studies appraised 
  in <a href="../../wg3/379.htm">Chapter10</a> 
  support the obvious expectations that lower stabilization targets involve substantially 
  higher mitigation costs and relatively more ambitious near-term emission reductions 
  on the one hand, but, as reported by WGII, lower targets induce significantly 
  smaller bio/geophysical impacts and thus induce smaller damages and adaptation 
  costs.</p>
