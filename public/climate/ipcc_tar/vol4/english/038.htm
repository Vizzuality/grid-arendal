    <td align="left">The climate system involves many processes that interact 
      in complex non-linear ways, which can give rise to thresholds (thus potentially 
      abrupt changes) in the climate system that could be crossed if the system 
      were perturbed sufficiently. These abrupt and other non-linear changes include 
      large climate-induced increase in greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial 
      ecosystems, a collapse of the thermohaline circulation (THC; see Figure 
      4-2), and disintegration of the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets. 
      Some of these changes have low probability of occurrence during the 21st 
      century; however, greenhouse gas forcing in the 21st century could set in 
      motion changes that could lead to such transitions in subsequent centuries 
      (see <a href="041.htm">Question 5</a>). Some of these changes (e.g., to 
      THC) could be irreversible over centuries to millennia. There is a large 
      degree of uncertainty about the mechanisms involved and aboutthe likelihood 
      or time scales of such changes; however, there is evidence from polar ice 
      cores of atmospheric regimes changing within a few years and large-scale 
      hemispheric changes as fast as a few decades with large consequences on 
      the biophysical systems.<br>

      The rapid increase in CH<sub>4</sub> lifetime possible with large emissions 
      of tropospheric pollutants does not occur within the range of SRES scenarios. 
      The CH<sub>4</sub> reservoir buried in solid hydrate deposits under permafrost 
      and ocean sediments is enormous, more than 1,000-fold the current atmospheric 
      content. A proposed climate feedback occurs when the hydrates decompose 
      in response to warming and release large amounts of CH<sub>4</sub> ; however, 
      most of the CH<sub>4</sub> gas released from the solid form is decomposed 
      by bacteria in the sediments and water column, thus limiting the amount 
      emitted to the atmosphere unless explosive ebullient emissions occur. The 
      feedback has not been quantified, but there are no observations to support 
      a rapid, massive CH<sub>4</sub> release in the record of atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> 
      over the past 50,000 years.<br>

      <b><a name="figspm42"></a>Figure 4-2: Schematic illustration of the global 
      circulation system in the world ocean consisting of major north-south thermohaline 
      circulation</b> routes in each ocean basin joining in the Antarctic circumpolar 
      circulation. Warm surface currents and cold deep currents are connected 
      in the few areas of deepwater formation in the high latitudes of the Atlantic 
      and around Antarctica (blue), where the major ocean-to-atmosphereheat transfer 
      occurs. This current system contributes substantially to the transport and 
      redistribution of heat (e.g., the poleward flowing currents in the North 
      Atlantic warm northwestern Europe by up to 10&deg;C). Model simulations 
      indicate that the North Atlantic branch of this circulation system is particularly 
      vulnerable to changes in atmospheric temperature and in the hydrological 
      cycle. Such perturbations caused by global warming could disrupt the current 
      system, which would have a strong impact on regional-to-hemispheric climate. 
      Note that this is a schematic diagram and it does not give the exact locations 
      of the water currents that form part of the THC.</td>
