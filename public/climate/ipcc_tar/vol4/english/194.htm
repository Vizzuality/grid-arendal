<h2><a name="89"></a>8.9 The Costs of Meeting a Range of Stabilization Targets 
</h2>
<p>Cost-effectiveness studies with a century timescale estimate that the costs 
  of stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere increase as the 
  concentration stabilization level declines. Different baselines can have a strong 
  influence on absolute costs. While there is a moderate increase in the costs 
  when passing from a 750ppmv to a 550ppmv concentration stabilization level, 
  there is a larger increase in costs passing from 550ppmv to 450ppmv unless the 
  emissions in the baseline scenario are very low. These results, however, do 
  not incorporate carbon sequestration and gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>, and 
  did not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced technological 
  change<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("wg3fnts.htm#29","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>29</a></sup></small>. 
  In particular, the choice of the reference scenario has a strong influence. 
  Recent studies using the IPCC SRES reference scenarios as baselines against 
  which to analyze stabilization clearly show that the average reduction in projected 
  GDP in most of the stabilization scenarios reviewed here is under 3% of the 
  baseline value (the maximum reduction across all the stabilization scenarios 
  reached 6.1% in a given year). At the same time, some scenarios (especially 
  in the A1T group) showed an increase in GDP compared to the baseline because 
  of apparent positive economic feedbacks of technology development and transfer. 
  The GDP reduction (averaged across storylines and stabilization levels) is lowest 
  in 2020 (1%), reaches a maximum in 2050 (1.5%), and declines by 2100 (1.3%). 
  However, in the scenario groups with the highest baseline emissions (A2 and 
  A1FI), the size of the GDP reduction increases throughout the modelling period. 
  Due to their relatively small scale when compared to absolute GDP levels, GDP 
  reductions in the post-SRES stabilization scenarios do not lead to significant 
  declines in GDP growth rates over this century. For example, the annual 1990-2100 
  GDP growth rate across all the stabilization scenarios was reduced on average 
  by only 0.003% per year, with a maximum reduction reaching 0.06% per year.</p>
<p>The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is determined more by 
  cumulative rather than by year-by-year emissions. That is, a particular concentration 
  target can be reached through a variety of emissions pathways. A number of studies 
  suggest that the choice of emissions pathway can be as important as the target 
  itself in determining overall mitigation costs. The studies fall into two categories: 
  those that assume that the target is known and those that characterize the issue 
  as one of decision making under uncertainty.</p>
<p>For studies that assume that the target is known, the issue is one of identifying 
  the least-cost mitigation pathway for achieving the prescribed target. Here 
  the choice of pathway can be seen as a carbon budget problem. This problem has 
  been so far addressed in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> only and very limited treatment 
  has been given to non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs. A concentration target defines an 
  allowable amount of carbon to be emitted into the atmosphere between now and 
  the date at which the target is to be achieved. The issue is how best to allocate 
  the carbon budget over time.</p>
<p>Most studies that have attempted to identify the least-cost pathway for meeting 
  a particular target conclude that such as pathway tends to depart gradually 
  from the model's baseline in the early years with more rapid reductions 
  later on. There are several reasons why this is so. A gradual near-term transition 
  from the world's present energy system minimizes premature retirement of 
  existing capital stock, provides time for technology development, and avoids 
  premature lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing low-emission technology. 
  On the other hand, more aggressive near-term action would decrease environmental 
  risks associated with rapid climatic changes, stimulate more rapid deployment 
  of existing low-emission technologies (see also <a href="#810">Section 8.10</a>), 
  provide strong near-term incentives to future technological changes that may 
  help to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive technologies, and allow for later 
  tightening of targets should that be deemed desirable in light of evolving scientific 
  understanding.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the lower the concentration target, the smaller 
  the carbon budget, and hence the earlier the departure from the baseline. However, 
  even with higher concentration targets, the more gradual transition from the 
  baseline does not negate the need for early action. All stabilization targets 
  require future capital stock to be less carbon-intensive. This has immediate 
  implications for near-term investment decisions. New supply options typically 
  take many years to enter into the marketplace. An immediate and sustained commitment 
  to R&amp;D is required if low-carbon low-cost substitutes are to be available 
  when needed. </p>
<p>The above addresses the issue of mitigation costs. It is also important to 
  examine the environmental impacts of choosing one emission pathway over another. 
  This is because different emission pathways imply not only different emission 
  reduction costs, but also different benefits in terms of avoided environmental 
  impacts (see <a href="198.htm">Section 10</a>).</p>
<p>The assumption that the target is known with certainty is, of course, an oversimplification. 
  Fortunately, the UNFCCC recognizes the dynamic nature of the decision problem. 
  It calls for periodic reviews "in light of the best scientific information 
  on climate change and its impacts." Such a sequential decision making process 
  aims to identify short-term hedging strategies in the face of long-term uncertainties. 
  The relevant question is not "what is the best course of action for the 
  next hundred years" but rather "what is the best course for the near-term 
  given the long-term uncertainties."</p>
<p>Several studies have attempted to identify the optimal near-term hedging strategy 
  based on the uncertainty regarding the long-term objective. These studies find 
  that the desirable amount of hedging depends upon one's assessment of the 
  stakes, the odds, and the cost of mitigation. The risk premium - the amount 
  that society is willing to pay to avoid risk - ultimately is a political 
  decision that differs among countries.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="810"></a>8.10 The Issue of Induced Technological Change</h2>
<p>Most models used to assess the costs of meeting a particular mitigation objective 
  tend to oversimplify the process of technical change. Typically, the rate of 
  technical change is assumed to be independent of the level of emissions control. 
  Such change is referred to as autonomous. In recent years, the issue of induced 
  technical change has received increased attention. Some argue that such change 
  might substantially lower and perhaps even eliminate the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  abatement policies. Others are much less sanguine about the impact of induced 
  technical change.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that the effect on timing depends on the source of 
  technological change. When the channel for technological change is R&amp;D, 
  the induced technological change makes it preferable to concentrate more abatement 
  efforts in the future. The reason is that technological change lowers the costs 
  of future abatement relative to current abatement, making it more cost-effective 
  to place more emphasis on future abatement. But, when the channel for technological 
  change is learning-by-doing, the presence of induced technological change has 
  an ambiguous impact on the optimal timing of abatement. On the one hand, induced 
  technical change makes future abatement less costly, which suggests emphasizing 
  future abatement efforts. On the other hand, there is an added value to current 
  abatement because such abatement contributes to experience or learning and helps 
  reduce the costs of future abatement. Which of these two effects dominates depends 
  on the particular nature of the technologies and cost functions.</p>
<p>Certain social practices may resist or enhance technological change. Therefore, 
  public awareness-raising and education may help encourage social change to an 
  environment favourable for technological innovation and diffusion. This represents 
  an area for further research.</p>
