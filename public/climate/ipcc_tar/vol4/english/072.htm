      gas emissions would be necessary to achieve stabilization of their concentrations.</span> 
      For example, for the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon 
      cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
      at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades, about a century, 
      or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter. 
      Emissions would peak in about 1 to 2 decades (450 ppm) and roughly a century 
      (1,000 ppm) from the present. Eventually stabilization would require CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions to decline to a very small fraction of current global emissions. 
      The <b><em>key uncertainties</em></b> here relate to the possibilities of 
      climate change feedbacks and development pathways and how these affect the 
      timing of emissions reductions.<br>

      is easier to identify sectors -- such as coal, possibly oil and gas, and 
      some energy-intensive industries dependent on energy produced from these 
      fossil fuels -- that are very likely to suffer an economic disadvantage 
      from mitigation. Their economic losses are more immediate, more concentrated, 
      and more certain. The sectors that are likely to benefit include renewable 
      energy, services, and new industries whose development is stimulated by 
      demand for low-emission fuels and production techniques. Different countries 
      and development paths have widely different energy structures, so they too 
      have different costs and benefits from mitigation. Carbon taxes can have 
      negative income effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues are 
      used directly or indirectly to compensate such effects.<br>

      burning are virtually certain to be to the dominant influence on the trend 
      on the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration during the 21st century. 
      Resource data assessed in the TAR may imply a change in the energy mix and 
      the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st century. Fossil-fuel 
      resources will not limit carbon emissions during the 21st century. The carbon 
      in proven conventional oil and gas reserves is much less, however, than 
      the cumulative carbon emissions associated with stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> 
      at levels of 450 ppm or higher.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnsyn.htm#25","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>25</sup></small></a> 
      These resource data may imply a change in the energy mix and the introduction 
      of new sources of energy during the 21st century. The choice of energy mix 
      and associated technologies and investments -- either more in the direction 
      of exploitation of unconventional oil and gas resources, or in the direction 
      of non-fossil energy sources, or fossil energy technology with carbon capture 
      and storage -- will determine whether, and if so, at what level and cost, 
      greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. <strong><em>Key uncertainties</em></strong> 
      are the future relative prices of energy and carbon-based fuels, and the 
      relative technical and economic attractiveness of non-fossil-fuel energy 
      alternatives compared with unconventional oil and gas resources.<br>

        if deployed as a portfolio of policy instruments to limit or reduce net 
        greenhouse gas emissions. </span>Significant progress in energy-saving 
        and low-carbon technologies has been made since 1995, and the progress 
        has been faster than anticipated in the SAR. Net emission reductions could 
        be achieved through, inter alia, improved techniques in production and 
        use of energy, shifts to low- or no-carbon technologies, CO<sub>2</sub> 
        removal and storage, improved land-use and forestry practices, and movement 
        to more sustainable lifestyles. Significant progress is taking place in 
        the development of wind turbines, solar energy, hybrid engine cars, fuel 
        cells, and underground CO<sub>2</sub> storage. <strong><em>Key uncertainties</em> 
        </strong>are (a) the likelihood of technological breakthroughs leading 
        to substantial reductions in costs and rapid take-up of low-carbon processes 
        and products, and (b) the future scale of private and public R&D expenditures
