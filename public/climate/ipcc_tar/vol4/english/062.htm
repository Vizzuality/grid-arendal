        and the intensive use of land, particularly in the world's arid and 
        semi-arid regions, has resulted in decreased soil fertility and increased 
        land degradation and desertification. The changes have been large enough

        more than 900 million people in 100 countries, and one quarter of the 
        world soil resources, most of them in the developing countries. The annual 
        recorded losses of millions of hectares significantly undermine economies 
        and create some irreversible situations. The TAR projections using the 
        SRES scenarios indicate increased droughts, higher intensity of rainfall, 
        more irregular rainfall patterns, and more frequent tropical summer drought 
        in the mid-latitude continental interiors. The systems that likely would 
        be impacted include those with scarce water resources, rangelands, and 
        land subsidence (see <a href="063.htm#tbl8-2">Table 8-2</a>).<br>

      <b><a name="figspm82"></a>Figure 8-2: This figure shows linkages between 
      climate change and other environmental factors in food supply and demand. 
      </b>Increasing food demand by a growing world population calls for larger 
      food production. This, in turn, brings a series of implications in the use 
      of land, such as converting wildlands to croplands (extensification), and 
      using chemical fertilizers and/or using irrigation to increase yield (intensification) 
      or enabling cultivation in otherwise non-usable land. Expanding the land 
      under cultivation results in loss of biodiversity, as ecosystems are converted 
      to fields growing only a few species (usually exotics). Change of forests 
      to agriculture brings a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, as forests 
      are replaced by grassland or cropland. This clearing also increases flooding 
      probability, as the agricultural systems retain less precipitation than 
      forests. Intensification of crop production can involve a variety of chemical 
      treatments, most of them being nitrogen fertilizers bringing the side effect 
      of release of nitrogen gas compounds (some of which are strong greenhouse 
      gases) to the atmosphere and nitrogen runoff into watersheds, with many 
      environmental and health implications. The expansion of irrigation affects 
      the supply of freshwater for other uses, leading to shortages and conflicts 
      over water-use rights. Meeting the needs for increased agricultural production 
      has the potential to increase global rates of biodiversity loss, climate 
      change, and desertification. There are interrelations, particularly to water, 
      that underly all these issues, but for simplicity are not shown in the figure.</td>
