  Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether 
  due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs 
  from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change 
  refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human 
  activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in 
  addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. 
  Attribution of climate change to natural forcing and human activities has been 
  addressed by Working Group I.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="2"></a>2</b> The report has been written by 
  183 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, and 243 Contributing Authors. 
  It was reviewed by 440 government and expert reviewers, and 33 Review Editors 
  oversaw the review process.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="3"></a>3</b> Delegations from 100 IPCC member 
  countries participated in the Sixth Session of Working Group II in Geneva on 
  13-16 February 2001.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="4"></a>4</b> A more comprehensive summary 
  of the report is provided in the Résumé technique, and relevant sections of 
  that volume are referenced in brackets at the end of paragraphs of the Summary 
  for Policymakers for readers who need more information.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="5"></a>5</b> There are 44 regional studies 
  of over 400 plants and animals, which varied in length from about 20 to 50 years, 
  mainly from North America, Europe, and the southern polar region. There are 
  16 regional studies covering about 100 physical processes over most regions 
  of the world, which varied in length from about 20 to 150 years. See <a href="153.htm#71">Section 
  7.1</a> of the <a href="124.htm">Résumé technique</a> for more detail.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="6"></a>6</b> In this <a href="108.htm">Summary 
  for Policymakers</a>, the following words have been used where appropriate to 
  indicate judgmental estimates of confidence (based upon the collective judgment 
  of the authors using the observational evidence, modeling results, and theory 
  that they have examined): very high (95% or greater), high (67-95%), medium 
  (33-67%), low (5-33%), and very low (5% or less). In other instances, a qualitative 
  scale to gauge the level of scientific understanding is used: well established, 
  established-but-incomplete, competing explanations, and speculative. The approaches 
  used to assess confidence levels and the level of scientific understanding, 
  and the definitions of these terms, are presented in <a href="126.htm#14">Section 
  1.4</a> of the <a href="124.htm">Résumé technique</a>. Each time these terms 
  are used in the <a href="108.htm">Summary for Policymakers</a>, they are footnoted 
  and in italics.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><a name="7"></a><b>7</b> Details of projected climate 
  changes, illustrated in <a href="111.htm#figspm2">Figure SPM-2</a>, are provided 
  in the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><a name="8"></a><b>8</b> Details of projected contributions 
  to sea-level rise from the West Anarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland Ice Sheet are 
  provided in the  <a href="../../wg1/005.htm">Working Group I Summary for Policymakers</a>.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="9"></a>9</b> Global mean temperature change 
  is used as an indicator of the magnitude of climate change. Scenario-dependent 
  exposures taken into account in these studies include regionally differentiated 
  changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic variables.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="10"></a>10</b> Eight studies have modeled 
  the effects of climate change on these diseases, five on malaria and three on 
  dengue. Seven use a biological, or process-based approach, and one uses an empirical, 
  statistical approach.</p>
