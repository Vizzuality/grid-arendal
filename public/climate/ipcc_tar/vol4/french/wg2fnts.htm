<p><a name="1"></a><b><sup>1</sup></b> Climate change in IPCC usage refers to 
  any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a 
  result of human activity. This usage differs from the definition in Article 
  1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate 
  change refers to a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly 
  to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which 
  is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time 
  periods.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnotetext"><a name="2"></a>2</span></b><span class="footnotetext"> 
  The term "mitigation" often is used in the insurance and financial 
  services sectors in much the same way as the term "adaptation" is 
  used in the climate research and policy communities.</span></p>
<p><b><span class="footnotetext"><a name="3"></a>3 </span></b><span class="footnotetext">Intervals 
  of global mean temperature increase of 0-2, 2-3, and &gt;3&deg;C relative 
  to 1990 are labeled small, moderate, and large, respectively. The relatively 
  large range for the "small" designation results because the literature 
  does adequately address a warming of 1-2&deg;C. These magnitudes of change 
  in global mean temperature should be taken as an approximate indicator of when 
  impacts might occur; they are not intended to define absolute thresholds or 
  to describe all relevant aspects of climate-change impacts, such as rate of 
  change in climate and changes in precipitation, extreme climate events, or lagged 
  (latent) effects such as rising sea levels.</span></p>
