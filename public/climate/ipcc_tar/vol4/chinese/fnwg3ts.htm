<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="2" ></a>2</b> In this report, as in the SAR, 
  no regrets options are defined as those options whose benefits such as reduced 
  energy costs and reduced emissions of local/regional pollutants equal or exceed 
  their costs to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change. They 
  are also known as negative cost options.<br>
</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="3" ></a>3</b> In this report 
  sometimes the term "co-benefits" is also used to indicate the additional 
  benefits of policy options that are implemented for various reasons at the same 
  time, acknowledging that most policies designed to address GHG mitigation also 
  have other, often at least equally important, rationales, e.g., related to objectives 
  of development, sustainability and equity. The benefits of avoided climate change 
  are not covered in ancillary or co-benefits. See also <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/187.htm" >Section 
  7.2</a>.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="4" ></a>4</b> The reference to a particular 
  concentration level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabilization 
  at this level. The selection of 550ppmv is based on the fact that the majority 
  of studies in the literature analyze this level, and does not imply any endorsement 
  of this level as a target for climate change mitigation policies.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="5" ></a>5</b> "Known technological options" 
  refer to technologies that exist in operation or pilot plant stage today, as 
  referenced in the mitigation scenarios discussed in this report. It does not 
  include any new technologies that will require drastic technological breakthroughs. 
  In this way it can be considered to be a conservative estimate, considering<br>
  the length of the scenario period.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="6" ></a>6</b> Reserves are those occurrences 
  that are identified and measured as economically and technically recoverable 
  with current technologies and prices. Resources are those occurrences with less 
  certain geological and/or economic characteristics, but which are considered 
  poten-tially recoverable with foreseeable technological and economic developments. 
  The resource base includes both categories. On top of that there are additional 
  quantities with unknown certainty of occurrence and/or with unknown or no economic 
  significance in the foreseeable future, referred to as "additional occurrences" 
  (SAR). Examples of unconventional fossil fuel resources are tar sands and shale 
  oils, geo-pressured gas, and gas in aquifers.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="7" ></a>7</b> International 
  Energy Statistics (IEA) report sectoral data for the industrial and transport 
  sectors, but not for buildings and agriculture, which are reported as "other". 
  In this section, information on energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 
  these sectors has been estimated using an allocation scheme and based on a standard 
  electricity conversion factor of 33%. In addition, values for the EIT countries 
  are from a different source (British Petroleum statistics). Thus, the sectoral 
  values can differ from the aggregate values presented in <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/172.htm" >section 
  3.2</a>, although general trends are the same. In general, there is uncertainty 
  in the data for the EITs and for the commercial and residential sub-categories 
  of the buildings sector in all regions.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="8" ></a>8</b> The potential 
  differs in different studies assessed but the aggregate potential reported in 
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/171.htm" >Sections 
  3</a> and <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/178.htm" >4</a> 
  refers to the socio-economic potential as indicated in Figure TS.7.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="9" ></a>9</b> All costs in US$.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="10" ></a>10 </span></b><span class="footnote_text">Note 
  that the section percentages do not add up to 100% as these emissions have been 
  allocated to the four sectors in the paragraphs above.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="11" ></a>11</b> Mitigative capacity: the social, 
  political, and economic structures and conditions that are required for effective 
  mitigation.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="12" ></a>12</b> A barrier is any obstacle 
  to reaching a potential that can be overcome by a policy, programme, or measure.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="13" ></a>13</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  An opportunity is a situation or circumstance to decrease the gap between the 
  market potential of a technology or practice and the economic, socio-economic, 
  or technological potential. </span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="14" ></a>14</b> "The ultimate objective 
  of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of 
  Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions 
  of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere 
  at such a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. 
  Such a level should be achieved within a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems 
  to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not 
  threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner."</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="15" ></a>15</b> "The Parties should take 
  precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent, or minimise the causes of climate 
  change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious 
  irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as 
  a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that polices and 
  measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure 
  global benefits at the lowest possible costs. To achieve this, such policies 
  and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be 
  comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse 
  gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address 
  climate change may be carried out co-operatively by interested Parties."</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="16" ></a>16</b> The highest figures cited 
  in this sentence are all results from one model: the ABARE-GTEM model.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="17" ></a>17</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  Hot air: a few countries, notably those with economies in transition, have assigned 
  amount units that appear to be well in excess of their anticipated emissions 
  (as a result of economic downturn). This excess is referred to as hot air. </span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><span class="footnote_text"><b><a name="18" ></a>18</b> 
  Although some studies include multi-gas analysis, much research is needed on 
  this potential both intertemporally and regionally. </span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="19" ></a>19</b> "Spillovers" from 
  domestic mitigation strategies are the effects that these strategies have on 
  other countries. Spillover effects can be positive or negative and include effects 
  on trade, carbon leakage, transfer and diffusion of environmentally sound technology, 
  and other issues.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="20" ></a>20</b> Many other studies incorporating 
  more precisely the country specifics and diversity of targetted policies provide 
  a wider range of net cost estimates.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="21" ></a>21</b> Annex II countries: Group 
  of countries included in Annex II to the UNFCCC, including all developed countries 
  in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="22" ></a>22</b> Annex B countries: Group of 
  countries included in Annex B in the Kyoto Protocol that have agreed to a target 
  for their greenhouse gas emissions, including all the Annex I countries (as 
  amended in 1998) but Turkey and Belarus. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="23" ></a>23</b> Many metrics can be used to 
  present costs. For example, if the annual costs to developed countries associated 
  with meeting Kyoto targets with full Annex B trading are in the order of 0.5% 
  of GDP, this represents US$125 billion (1000 million) per year, or US$125 per 
  person per year by 2010 in Annex II (SRES assumptions). This corresponds to 
  an impact on economic growth rates over ten years of less than 0.1 percentage 
  point. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="24" ></a>24</b> Spillover effects here incorporate 
  only economic effects, not environmental effects. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="25" ></a>25</b> Details of the six studies 
  reviewed are found in Table 9.4 of the underlying report. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="26" ></a>26</b> These estimated costs can 
  be expressed as differences in GDP growth rates over the period 2000-2010. With 
  no emissions trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points/year; 
  with Annex B emissions trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage 
  points/year. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="27" ></a>27</b> These policies and measures 
  include: those for non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases and non-energy sources of all gases; 
  offsets from sinks; industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier 
  of energy services); use of OPEC's market power; and actions (e.g. of Annex 
  B Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In 
  addition, the studies typically do not include the following policies and effects 
  that can reduce the total cost of mitigation: the use of tax revenues to reduce 
  tax burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental ancillary benefits 
  of reductions in fossil fuel use; and induced technological change from mitigation 
  policies. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="28" ></a>28</b> Carbon leakage is defined 
  here as the increase in emissions in non-Annex B countries resulting from implementation 
  of reductions in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of Annex B reductions. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="29" ></a>29</b> Induced technological change 
  is an emerging field of inquiry. None of the literature reviewed in TAR on the 
  relationship between the century-scale CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and costs 
  reported results for models employing induced technological change. Models with 
  induced technological change under some circumstances show that century-scale 
  concentrations can differ, with similar GDP growth but under different policy 
  regimes. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="30" ></a>30</b> Pareto optimum is a requirement 
  or status that an individual's welfare could not be further improved without 
  making others in the society worse off.
