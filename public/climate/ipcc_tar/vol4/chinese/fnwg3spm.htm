Mitigation is defined here as an anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources 
of greenhouse gases or enhance their sinks.</span> 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="2" ></a>2</b> Climate change in IPCC usage 
  refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability 
  or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the UNFCCC, 
  where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly 
  or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere 
  and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable 
  time periods.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="3" ></a>3</b> Section numbers refer to the 
  main body of the Report.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="4" ></a>4</b> In this report "alternative 
  development paths" refer to a variety of possible scenarios for societal 
  values and consumption and production patterns in all countries, including but 
  not limited to a continuation of today's trends. These paths do not include 
  additional climate initiatives which means that no scenarios are included that 
  explicitly assume implementation of the UNFCCC or the emission targets of the 
  Kyoto Protocol, but do include assumptions about other policies that influence 
  greenhouse gas emissions indirectly. </p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="5" ></a>5</b> Approaches to 
  equity have been classified into a variety of categories, including those based 
  on allocation, outcome, process, rights, liability, poverty, and opportunity, 
  reflecting the diverse expectations of fairness used to judge policy processes 
  and the corresponding outcomes (<a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/056.htm" >Sections 
  1.3</a>, <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/396.htm" >10.2</a>).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="6" ></a>6</b> Emissions from all regions diverge 
  from baselines at some point. Global emissions diverge earlier and to a greater 
  extent as stabilization levels are lower or underlying scenarios are higher. 
  Such scenarios are uncertain, do not provide information on equity implications 
  and how such changes may be achieved or who may bear any costs incurred.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="7" ></a>7</b> Reserves are those occurrences 
  that are identified and measured as economically and technically recoverable 
  with current technologies and prices. Resources are those occurrences with less 
  certain geological and/or economic characteristics, but which are considered 
  potentially recoverable with foreseeable technological and economic developments. 
  The resource base includes both categories. On top of that, there are additional 
  quantities with unknown certainty of occurrence and/or with unknown or no economic 
  significance in the foreseeable future, referred to as "additional occurrences" 
  (SAR, Working Group II). Examples of unconventional fossil fuel resources include 
  tar sands, shale oil, other heavy oil, coal bed methane, deep geopressured gas, 
  gas in acquifers, etc.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="8" ></a>8</b> "Known technological options" 
  refer to technologies that exist in operation or pilot plant stage today, as 
  referenced in the mitigation scenarios discussed in this report. It does not 
  include any new technologies that will require drastic technological breakthroughs. 
  In this way it can be considered to be a conservative estimate, considering 
  the length of the scenario period.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="9" ></a>9</b> Ancillary benefits are the ancillary, 
  or side effects, of policies aimed exclusively at climate change mitigation. 
  Such policies have an impact not only on greenhouse gas emissions, but also 
  on resource use efficiency, like reduction in emissions of local and regional 
  air pollutants associated with fossil fuel use, and on issues such as transportation, 
  agriculture, land-use practices, employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these 
  benefits are referred to as "ancillary impacts" to reflect that in 
  some cases the benefits may be negative.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="10" ></a>10 </span></b><span class="footnote_text">In 
  this report, as in the SAR, no regrets opportunities are defined as those options 
  whose benefits such as reduced energy costs and reduced emissions of local/regional 
  pollutants equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits of 
  avoided climate change.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="11" ></a>11</b> A voluntary agreement is an 
  agreement between a government authority and one or more private parties, as 
  well as a unilateral commitment that is recognized by the public authority, 
  to achieve environmental objectives or to improve environmental performance 
  beyond compliance.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="12" ></a>12</b> Many other studies 
  incorporating more precisely the country specifics and diversity of targeted 
  policies provide a wider range of net cost estimates (<a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/326.htm" >Section 
  8.2.2</a>).</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="13" ></a>13</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  Annex II countries: Group of countries included in Annex II to the UNFCCC, including 
  all developed countries in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="14" ></a>14 </b>Annex B countries: Group of 
  countries included in Annex B in the Kyoto Protocol that have agreed to a target 
  for their greenhouse gas emissions, including all the Annex I countries (as 
  amended in 1998) but Turkey and Belarus.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="15" ></a>15</b> Many metrics can be used to 
  present costs. For example, if the annual costs to developed countries associated 
  with meeting Kyoto targets with full Annex B trading are in the order of 0.5% 
  of GDP, this represents US$125 billion (1000 million) per year, or US$125 per 
  person per year by 2010 in Annex II (SRES assumptions). This corresponds to 
  an impact on economic growth rates over ten years of less than 0.1 percentage 
  point.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="16" ></a>16</b> Induced technological 
  change is an emerging field of inquiry. None of the literature reviewed in TAR 
  on the relationship between the century-scale CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  and costs, reported results for models employing induced technological change. 
  Models with induced technological change under some circumstances show that 
  century-scale concentrations can differ, with similar GDP growth <span class="footnote_text">but 
  under different policy regimes (<a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/346.htm#841" >Section 
  8.4.1.4</a>).</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="17" ></a>17</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  See <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/figspm1.htm" >Figure 
  SPM.1</a> for the influence of reference scenarios on the magnitude of the required 
  mitigation effort to reach a given stabilization level.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><span class="footnote_text"><b><a name="18" ></a>18</b> 
  Spillover effects incorporate only economic effects, not environmental effects.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="19" ></a>19</b> Details of the 
  six studies reviewed are found in <a target="_top" href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/360.htm#tab94" >Table 
  9.4</a> of the underlying report.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="20" ></a>20</b> These estimated costs can 
  be expressed as differences in GDP growth rates over the period 2000-2010. 
  With no emissions trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points/year; 
  with Annex B emissions trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage 
  points/year.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="21" ></a>21</b> These policies 
  and measures include: those for non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases and non-energy sources 
  of all gases; offsets from sinks; industry restructuring (e.g., from energy 
  producer to supplier of energy services); use of OPEC's market power; and 
  actions (e.g. of Annex B Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the transfer 
  of technology. In addition, the studies typically do not include the following 
  policies and effects that can reduce the total cost of mitigation: the use of 
  tax revenues to reduce tax burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental 
  ancillary benefits of reductions in fossil fuel use; and induced technological 
  change from mitigation policies.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="22" ></a>22</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  Carbon leakage is defined here as the increase in emissions in non-Annex B countries 
  due to implementation of reductions in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of 
  Annex B reductions. </span>
