      <h2 align="left">Introduction </h2>
      <p><b>Bakary Kante <br>
        Director, Policy Development and Law<br>
        United Nations Environment Programme </b></p>
      <p align="left">United Nations Environment Programme and its collaborating 
        centre, GRID-Arendal are pleased to present the "Vital Climate Change 
        Graphics for Africa" as our special effort to provide easily understandable 
        scientific information to policy makers working in Africa. This set of 
        25 graphics focuses on the special challenges that Africa faces due to 
        expected long term changes in climate. </p>
      <p align="left">The latest report (Third Assessment Report) of the UNEP/WMO 
        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes a warming of approximately 
        0.7°C over most of the African continent during the 20th century based 
        on historical records. While the exact nature of the changes in temperature 
        or precipitation, and extreme events are not known, there is general agreement 
        that extreme events will get worse, and trends in most variables will 
        change in response to warming.</p>
      <p align="left"> By the end of this century, global mean surface temperature 
        is expected to increase between 1.5 ºC and 6ºC. Sea levels are projected 
        to rise by 15 to 95 cm. The expected warming is greatest over the interior 
        of semi-arid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa. The graphics 
        indicate that temperature rise in Africa corresponds to global temperature 
        rise, and that adverse impacts including extremes, are spread across the 
        diverse environments of Africa, putting a huge proportion of African continent 
        at great risk.</p>
      <p align="left"> These graphics also show the severity of impacts for the 
        important sectors of water, health, food for Africa. A very sparse observational 
        network in Africa is one of the constraints in improving Africa's understanding 
        of local climate and makes predictions of future climate change difficult 
        at the sub-regional to local level. For the Global Climate Observing System 
        Surface Network (GSN) in Africa, only 26 percent of the 155 GSN stations 
        provided greater than 50 percent of required reports during 2000. </p>
      <p align="left">On the other hand, there is vast local knowledge on dealing 
        with climate variability in Africa. There is increasing interest in harnessing 
        local strategies to cope with current climate and extremes to build adaptive 
        capacity for future climate change. Therefore, the study of climate change 
        at the local scale will greatly enhance Africa's efforts towards sustainable 
        development. This requires exploring and strengthening the adaptive capacity 
        of communities and countries that are specifically vulnerable to climate 
        change. </p>
      <p align="left">The latest (third) assessment report of the IPCC states, 
        "Clearly, adaptive capacity to deal with climate risks is closely related 
        to sustainable development and equity. Enhancement of adaptive capacity 
        is fundamental to sustainable development." I hope that this set of "Vital 
        Climate Graphics for Africa (VCGA)" developed on the basis of the latest 
        IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and related peer-reviewed literature 
        will generate discussion and knowledge in the continent with the aim to 
        strengthen society's adaptive capacity. Previous production of similar 
        graphics at the global level has been very successful in capturing key 
        issues. This set follows in that tradition and is based on examples and 
        applications that are African.</p>
      <p align="left"> It is hoped that people from all parts of Africa will find 
        something to resonate with, and they will join in accumulating evidence 
        on and knowledge about climate change and its impacts.</p>
      <p align="left"> I take this opportunity to particularly thank Dr. Paul 
        Desanker on behalf of UNEP for leading the technical team and providing 
        valuable information for developing these graphics. Without his contribution 
        this publication would not have been possible. Our appreciation also goes 
        to Mr. Svein Tveitdal and Mr. Åke Bjørke of GRID-Arendal for making these 
        graphics possible within a very short time. These graphics are part of 
        a series by GRID-Arendal to turn complex scientific information in easy-to-understand 
        visuals. </p>
      <p align="left">For background information on these graphics I urge the 
        readers to look at the following web sites: <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch">http://www.ipcc.ch</a>
