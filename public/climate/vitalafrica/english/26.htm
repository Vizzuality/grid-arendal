            <h2 align="left">26. Food production. Projections.</h2>
            <p align="left">African food production is on the decline</p>
            <p align="left">
              Agriculture is not only a vital source of food in Africa; it also 
              is the prevailing way of life. An average of 70% of the population 
              lives by farming, and 40% of all exports are earned from agricultural 
              products (WRI, 1996). Onethird of the national income in Africa 
              is generated by agriculture. Crop production and livestock husbandry 
              account for about half of household income. The poorest members 
              of society are those who are most dependent on agriculture for jobs 
              and income. On average, the poor from developing countries of SSA 
              spend 60-80% of their total income on food (see Odingo, 1990; WRI, 
              1998; FAO, 1999b).</p>
            <p align="left">Food production in most of SSA has not kept pace with 
              the population increase over the past 3 decades. In Africa as a 
              whole, food consumption exceeded domestic production by 50% in the 
              drought-prone mid-1980s and more than 30% in the mid-1990s (WRI, 
              1998). Food aid constitutes a major proportion of net food trade 
              in Africa, and in many countries it constitutes more than half of 
              net imports. In Kenya and Tanzania, for instance, food aid constituted 
              two-thirds of food imports during the 1990s. Despite food imports, 
              per capita dietary energy supply (DES) remains relatively low (Hulme,
              1996); about one-third of the countries in Africa had a per capita 
              DES of less than 2,000 kcal per day in the 1990s, which is lower 
              than the minimum recommended intake (data from WRI, 1998). Agricultural 
              and economic growth must rise perhaps by 4% per year to realize 
              basic development goals. Today, only a few countries achieve this 
              rate of growth. One consequence of agricultural growth could be 
              the doubling of cultivated land area by 2050 at great cost to the 
              natural environment-unless there is greater investment in agricultural 
              management and technology on existing cropland (Anon, 1999). A major 
              challenge facing Africa is to increase agricultural production and 
              achieve sustainable economic growth;
              both are essential to improving food security.</p>
