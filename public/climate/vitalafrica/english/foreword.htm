        </b><b>Executive Director<br>
        United Nations Environment Programme</b></p>
      <p>Africa is considered highly vulnerable to climate change by the Third 
        Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
        (IPCC). The TAR is widely accepted as the most authoritative source of 
        climate change information available. </p>
      <p align="left">UNEP has attempted to unravel this complex science of climate 
        change in Africa through simple graphics to increase public awareness. 
        Recognising the direct relevance of long-term changes happening in climate 
        to the daily life to residents of Africa, strong public awareness is vital 
        to minimise adverse impacts. </p>
      <p align="left">Vital Climate Graphics for Africa is based on the most recent 
        scientific data provided by the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC (2001) 
        and other data reviewed by a Scientific Advisory Group. Policymakers, 
        teachers, experts, media professionals and students who are making efforts 
        to address the root causes of environmental degradation and climate change 
        should find this publication an effective tool in their work.</p>
      <p align="left"> The Article 6 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
        Change (UNFCCC) legally ratified by 186 Governments calls for public access 
        to information on climate change and its effects. This commitment requires 
        not only a one way flow of information from the experts to the general 
        public, but need to significantly benefit from observations by African 
        citizens who take decisions every day that have the potential to either 
        mitigate climate change or reduce vulnerability to it.</p>
      <p align="left"> I hope that your personal copy of the Vital Climate Change 
        for Africa will encourage you to be part of a Africa-wide network for 
        improving the quality and quantity of information on how to mitigate and 
        reduce vulnerability to climate change. This will help UNEP to up-date 
        the Vital Climate Graphics for Africa as a more useful tool for everybody. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">We recognise that the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol have 
        the potential to renew efforts for improving sustainable development policies 
        in Africa. UNEP through VCGA therefore aims to engage stakeholders and 
        major groups in the development and implementation of policies related 
        to UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, and promoting sustainable development in 
        Africa.</p>
      <p align="left"> I thank the various experts for their valuable contribution 
        to this publication and am appreciative for the financial support provided 
        by the Norwegian Government for this venture. </p>
