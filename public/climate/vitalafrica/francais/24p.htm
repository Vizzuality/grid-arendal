            <h2 align="left">24. Impacts on water and water stress </h2>
            <p align="left">Reduced water availability will have adverse health 
              effectsThe water supply situation in Africa is already precarious. 
              The water stress will be exacerbated with climate change. Less water 
              will have a negative health impact, with increasing gastro-intestinal 
              problems.As water resource stresses become acute in future water-deficit 
              areas of Africa as a result of a combination of climate impacts 
              and escalating human demand, there will be intensifying conflict 
              between human and environmental demands on water resources. Because 
              maintenance of healthy ecosystems is an underpinning to economic 
              sustainability, there is need in each water basin management unit 
              to identify and factor into development projects the need for environmental 
              flows.</p>
            <p align="left">The main challenges that are likely to face African 
              populations will emanate from the effects of extreme events such 
              as tropical storms, floods, landslides, wind, cold waves, droughts, 
              and abnormal sea-level rises that are expected as a result of climate 
              change. These events are likely to exacerbate management problems 
              relating to pollution, sanitation, waste disposal, water supply, 
              public health, infrastructure, and technologies of production (IPCC, 
              1996).Possible health implications of climate change and climate 
              variability will be through vector- and water-borne pathogens. In 
              many African urban settlements, urban drift has outpaced the capacity 
              of municipal authorities to provide civic works for sanitation and 
              other health delivery services. </p>
            <p align="left">The outbreak of cholera during recent floods in east 
              Africa and Mozambique underscores the need for adequate sanitation. 
              It should be noted that although the outbreaks were spread from 
              as far north as Mombassa and Nairobi in the north to Beira in the 
              south, incidences remained localized to the outbreak centers because 
              of the isolated nature of the affected urban areas. If settlement 
              conglomerations such as those envisaged for west Africa and the 
              eastern seaboard of South Africa develop-as discussed by Nicholls 
              et al. (1999)-vulnerable population and areas will tend to be regional, 
              rather than local. </p>
            <p align="left">Review of sanitary facilities now rather than later 
              will not only be beneficial to communities now but in the long run 
              will be cost saving for long-term health delivery services.Water 
              issues in urban and rural areas are likely to become more critical, 
              given increasing and competing demands, as well as rapid population 
              growth. Infrastructure to store and serve water in major urban areas 
              is mostly overstretched in capacity, and extreme events such as 
              floods that cause physical damage add to the problem. Monitoring 
              of water levels and water use is very poor and limits analysis of 
              vulnerability. </p>
