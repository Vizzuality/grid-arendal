      <p align="left"><b>Prof. dr. Paul Desanker<br>

        USA</b></p>
      <p align="left">Climate change is real, and it has great significance for 
        sustainable development plans, life and livelihoods, in Africa more than 
        any other continent. The diversity in climatic regimes across this vast 
        continent from arid and seasonally-arid tropical regimes to humid equatorial 
        regimes, with differing degrees of temporal variability make discussions 
        of climate change for Africa challenging. The discussion becomes more 
        real when local examples are used to demonstrate patterns, impacts and 
        vulnerabilities, as this is the scale at which humans operate. This set 
        of &quot;Vital Climate Graphics for Africa&quot; has been developed based 
        on the latest IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and subsequent syntheses 
        found in other literature. They highlight regional and local aspects of 
        climate change for Africa and are designed to convey main messages about 
        the impacts of climate change to encourage public discussion and the development 
        of local solutions. It is hoped that these images will serve as a model 
        for further summaries in future, and everyone is encouraged to submit 
        suggestions to UNEP. <br>
        <br>
        The IPCC TAR reports a warming of approximately 0.7&deg;C over most of 
        the continent during the 20th century based on historical records, a decrease 
        in rainfall over large portions of the Sahel, and an increase in rainfall 
        in east central Africa. The temperature trend over time is the most reliable, 
        and when associated with warming, changes can be expected in precipitation 
        patterns, a rise in sea-level and increased frequencies of extreme events. 
        While the exact nature of the changes in temperature or precipitation, 
        and extreme events are not known, there is general agreement that extreme 
        events will get worse, and trends in most variables will change in response 
        to warming. By the end of this century, global mean surface temperature 
        is expected to increase between 1.5 &deg; C and 6&deg; C<br>
        . <br>
        These changes are expected to have serious consequences for Africa. The 
        extreme hardships in terms of food and water for the arid and semi-arid 
        areas of West and Horn of Africa as well as Southern Africa, are related 
        to low and highly variable rainfall. Major flooding events in many parts 
        of Africa have also been linked to the possible influence of climate change. 
        The impact of these on human life, livelihoods and economies is significant, 
        and must be clearly communicated to help establish the right level of 
        attention on climate change that is required, especially in the midst 
        of other more immediate problems of development such as poverty, poor 
        health, food and water insecurity. </p>
      <p align="left">Climate change has a direct influence on these problems, 
        and so, poverty, poor health, food and water insecurity cannot be overcome 
        without due consideration to climate issues at present and in the future. 
        The relegation by many African policy and decision makers that climate 
        change is a long-term problem that can wait is most misleading. Climate 
        change is real, has already started to happen, and is having major impacts 
        in all aspects of life in Africa as highlighted in the graphics presented 
        here. <br>
        <br>
        While the science literature is full of details and assessments of various 
        climate phenomena, stakeholders, especially those developing policies 
        and making day-to-day decisions on production systems etc, are not readily 
        exposed to this information. Much is often said about the need to package 
        information in effective ways to reach the ears of policy makers and civic 
        society. This vital climate graphics package with a set of key visual 
        displays of climate change and its impacts is a serious attempt at achieving 
        this science to policy and science to civil society dialogue. Examples 
        are given of undisputed signs of global warming, and impacts on different 
        regions and sectors.<br>
        <br>
        It is very clear from the graphics presented that temperature rise in 
        Africa corresponds to global temperature rise, and that adverse impacts 
        including extremes, are spread across the diverse environments of Africa, 
        putting a huge proportion of Africa at great risk. These graphics also 
        show the severity of impacts for the important sectors of water, health, 
        food for Africa. <br>
        <br>
        A very sparse observational network for Africa is a major constraint in 
        improving our understanding of local climate and makes predictions of 
        future climate change difficult at the sub-regional to local level. Remote 
        sensing methods for monitoring weather variables are a useful source of 
        data for seasonal forecasting of large-scale processes and interlinkages 
        such as sea-surface temperature links to major disease outbreaks on adjoining 
        land areas. The ability to track storm systems enables communities to 
        prepare and respond to extreme events. While technology has advanced, 
        the transfer of these methods to the local area to help ordinary Africans 
        to adapt to climate change remains a significant challenge that must be 
        addressed. <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, there is vast local knowledge on dealing with climate 
        variability in Africa. There is increasing interest in harnessing local 
        strategies to cope with current climate and extremes to build adaptive 
        capacity for future climate change. The study of climate change at the 
        local scale will greatly enhance Africa's efforts towards sustainable 
        development.<br>
        <br>
        It is hoped that the set of graphics presented here will provide an invaluable 
        resource for scientists and civil society in Africa to gain a better understanding 
        of climate change in Africa, and how it might impact on their life and 
        livelihood at the local scale. Background notes are given to guide technical 
        experts in their communication with their stakeholders or students. Previous 
        productions of similar graphics at the global level have been very successful 
        in capturing key issues - this set follows in that tradition and is based 
        on examples and applications that are African. It is hoped that people 
        from all parts of Africa will find something to resonate with, and they 
        will join in accumulating evidence on and knowledge about climate change 
        and its impacts.</p>
