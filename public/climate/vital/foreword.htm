      <p><b>Klaus Töpfer, Executive Director,<br>
	United Nations Environment Programme</b></p>
      <p>As evidence accumulates that we may already be witnessing the early signs
	of global climate change, the need to communicate this issue to both policymakers
	and the general public becomes ever more urgent. The challenge facing
	generalists is that the subject is complex and often highly specialized.
	Much of our understanding of climate change comes from sophisticated computer-based
	models, data sets, and theoretical insights. Decision-makers need insight
	into such scientific information if they are to craft and implement effective
	solutions.</p>
      <p> Fortunately, a good deal of the evidence and information we have about
	climate change lends itself to graphical presentation. The visual information
	contained in Vital Climate Graphics makes it possible to grasp complex
	facts more quickly and fully than would be possible through simple text.
	The graphical impact is supported by additional written details that help
	to fill in the picture. The first set of graphics focuses on the impacts
	of climate change and are available as overhead slides and can be obtained
	via CD ROMs, booklets or the Internet.
      <p> Vital Climate Graphics are based on the reports of the Intergovernmental
	Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was established by the United Nations
	Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. The IPCC's
	1995 Second Assessment Report is widely respected as the most authoritative
	source of climate change information available. More recently, the IPCC
	has also published a number of Special Reports on specific topics. Vital
	Climate Graphics will be updated after the forthcoming Third Assessment
	Report, scheduled for publication in 2001, becomes available. In this
	way, they will continue to be an effective tool for decision-making for
	years to come.
