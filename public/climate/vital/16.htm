      <p>14. In 1988, UNEP and WMO jointly established the Intergovernmental Panel
	on Climate Change (IPCC) as concern over climate change became a political
	issue. The purpose of the IPCC was to assess the state of knowledge on
	the various aspects of climate change including science, environmental
	and socio-economic impacts and response strategies.
      <p> The IPCC is recognized as the most authoritative scientific and technical
	voice on climate change, and its assessments had a profound influence
	on the negotiators of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
	Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol. The IPCC continues to provide
	governments with scientific, technical and socio-economic information
	relevant to evaluating the risks and developing a response to global climate
	change.
      <p> The IPCC is organized into three working groups plus a task force on
	national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. Each of these four bodies has
	two co-chairmen (one from a developed and one from a developing country)
	and a technical support unit. Working Group I assesses the scientific
	aspects of the climate system and climate change; Working Group II addresses
	the vulnerability of human and natural systems to climate change, the
	negative and positive consequences of climate change, and options for
	adapting to them; and Working Group III assesses options for limiting
	greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change, as well
	as economic issues. Approximately 400 experts from some 120 countries
	are directly involved in drafting, revising and finalizing the IPCC reports
	and another 2,500 experts participate in the review process. The IPCC
	authors are nominated by governments and by international organizations
	including NGOs. </p>
