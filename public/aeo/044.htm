<h4>Strategies for coping with climate variability in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>All Eastern African governments except Somalia have signed and ratified the 
  UNCCD. Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda have produced National Action Plans, and 
  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) (see Chapter 1) has produced 
  a sub-regional action plan for the countries in the Horn of Africa (UNCCD 2001). 
  All Eastern African countries (except Rwanda and Burundi) belong to IGAD. Monitoring 
  and early warning systems have been put in place, through IGAD, to improve the 
  ability to cope with climate variability. ENSO-related events can also now be 
  detected, as a result of research conducted under the World Meteorological Organization's 
  (WMO) Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere programme. The WMO issues monthly 
  statements (El Niño Update) to provide effective, accurate, and timely information 
  to all concerned, to allow them to take mitigatory action. However, most of 
  the national institutions in the subregion are under-resourced making adequate 
  early warning dependent on donor support. In April 2000, an Inter-Agency Task 
  Force on the UN Response to Long Term Food Security, Agricultural Development 
  and Related Aspects in the Horn of Africa was launched. The Task Force has produced 
  a strategy for the Elimination of Hunger in the Horn of Africa aimed at broadening 
  opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, and formulating and implementing 
  country food security programmes. In Kenya, research into traditional methods 
  of coping with climate variability is also underway, with the aim of applying 
  traditional knowledge to commercial enterprises (see <a href="#box2a2">Box 2a.2</a>).</p>

            <p>Drought is extremely difficult to predict and the variable duration 
              and extent of the phenomenon make its effects difficult to manage. 
              For pastoralists, following the rains and pasture is a natural part 
              of their system, and setting aside of areas for grazing reserves 
              and splitting of herds to minimize risk are part of their coping 
              mechanisms. However, exclusion from some traditional grazing areas 
              has compromised their ability to cope during dry periods and drought.</p>
            <p>A project conducted by the African Centre for Technology Studies 
              (Kenya) aims to identify traditional means of reducing vulnerability 
              to environmental change in dryland Africa, and incorporate them 
              into commercial food production systems. Field studies were conducted 
              to gather information on ways in which rural households use indigenous 
              plants in responding to drought, and how national environmental 
              policies affect their practises.</p>
