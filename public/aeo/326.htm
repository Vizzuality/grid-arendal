<h3>CIVIL SOCIETY PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT </h3>
<p>The increasing role of NGOs in environmental management became evident during 
  the UNCED (1992). This event was attended by some 8 000 NGOs from more than 
  160 countries; the Habitat II Conference, in 1996, was attended by representatives 
  of more than 500 local authorities. The role played by NGOs in environmental 
  management and other areas of development work in Africa has changed considerably 
  over the past two decades. NGOs-once perceived by some governments as subversive 
  elements in the development process-have become, in many cases, centre stage 
  performers. Expectations as to what NGOs can and must contribute to development 
  have thus changed dramatically. Whereas, previously, NGOs had to gain a seat 
  at the policy-making table, today they are necessary participants in all aspects 
  of development programming from the donor and, increasingly, from the national 
  government perspective. The question of the capacities of the NGO sector in 
  Africa is sensitive and sometimes controversial, but the consensus seems to 
  be that NGOs are strong at promoting local participation, and that they fill 
  a niche in certain aspects of sectoral work. They are, on the other hand, seen 
  as relatively weak in complex, multi-component projects. Some NGOs are effective 
  at lobbying and advocacy while others, the majority in Africa, are fairly weak 
  in both technical and institutional aspects of project or programme planning 
  and implementation (Brown and McGann 1996). Although the quality and capacity 
  of NGO work in Africa is improving, their capacities need to be strengthened.</p>

<p><a name="img56"></a>Broad public participation in decision-making is an important 
  element of Agenda 21 because, combined with greater accountability, it is basic 
  to the concept of sustainable development (UNEP 1999). However, if people are 
  to participate effectively, they must first be aware of the problems. Agenda 
  21 also recognizes that there is a considerable lack of awareness of the interrelated 
  nature of human activities and the environment, due to inaccurate or insufficient 
  information. Increasing public awareness is, therefore, a prerequisite for action, 
  and is an essential element of any educational effort to stimulate or strengthen 
  attitudes, values and actions which are compatible with sustainable development.</p>
<p>Agenda 21 devotes separate chapters to involving many different groups including 
  women, children and youth, indigenous people, NGOs, local authorities, workers 
  and trade unions, business and industry, scientists, technologists and farmers 
  (UN 1993). The belief is that both individuals and members of these groups are 
  the best source of knowledge about the causes of, and remedies for, many environmental 
  problems (UNEP 1999, NEMA 2001). Public participation enables such knowledge, 
  skills and resources to be mobilized and fully employed, and the effectiveness 
  of government initiatives to be increased (UNEP 1999).</p>
<p>African countries by themselves, and through the support of such organizations 
  as UNEP and AMCEN, have increased public awareness about the environment, and 
  have encouraged participation. There is public participation in the formulation 
  of policies and strategic plans and, in major projects, through the environmental 
  impact assessment process. In Uganda, the right of the public to participate 
  in environmental matters is enshrined in the country's constitution, adopted 
  in 1995 (GoU 1995). Formulation of Uganda's long-term development perspective, 
  Vision 2025, involved extensive consultations. It is, as a result, a product 
  of consensus (MoFPED 1999).</p>
<p>Apart from statutory requirements or government policy directives, public participation 
  in environmental decision making is also being promoted from within civil society. 
  Various projects, both international and from local non-governmental and community-based 
  organizations, have promoted public participation. Public participation is also 
  a strong aspect of decentralized environmental management. In encouraging transparency, 
  accountability and ownership, African countries have welcomed the contribution 
  of public participation in decision making, including in the area of environmental 
  management.</p>
<h3>GENERAL GOVERNANCE</h3>
<p>Democratic governance is beginning to take root in Africa. There are now far 
  fewer military dictatorships, and the military <i>coups d'état</i> common in 
  the 1960s and up to the 1980s are much less frequent. This shift has facilitated 
  a better focus on sustainable development. Through the efforts of AMCEN and 
  sub-regional organizations, and at national level, there is strong political 
  support for better management of Africa's environment. The environment now features 
  prominently in political pronouncements across Africa. In those African countries 
  where efforts have been made to devolve political power to lower levels of government, 
  this augers well for the principles of decentralized environmental management. 
  However, the capacities of lower levels of government and community-based organizations 
  will have to be built to equip them for their new roles as environmental planners 
  and managers.</p>
<h3>DEFINING A DEVELOPMENT PATH</h3>
<p>Having been used as a laboratory for a variety of economic and social development 
  paradigms in the past, African governments have had the opportunity to learn 
  important lessons useful for defining appropriate paths for the 21st century. 
  Clearly, the Great Transitions scenario-requiring a development paradigm in 
  which responses to the challenge of sustainability are based on new values, 
  and on more humanistic forms of social and economic organization-is the most 
  appealing (see <a href="261.htm">Chapter 4</a>). For the present, however, this 
  must be seen as utopian, given the present situation of African countries. The 
  challenge, therefore, is to select paths that will lead these countries from 
  their present situations through the other scenarios and, ultimately, to the 
  Great Transitions scenario, to be reached at some predetermined point in the 
  future. How this should be done and the time it will take will depend on the 
  capacities and capabilities of individual African countries. As described earlier 
  (<a href="261.htm">Chapter 4</a>), both the Fortress World scenario (in which 
  the wealthy protect themselves in enclaves, while environmental stress elsewhere 
  leads to fragmentation, extreme inequality and widespread conflict) and the 
  Market Forces scenario (where market-driven global development leads to converging 
  values and patterns of development) are undesirable, and are unlikely to lead 
  Africa towards sustainable improvements in quality of life in the long run. 
  The Policy Reform scenario (incremental policy adjustments steering conventional 
  development toward environmental and policy reduction goals) is a good start, 
  given the current situations of most African countries, but it, too, must ultimately 
  give way to the Great Transitions scenario as a sustainable development option. 
  The newly established African Union will have a significant role to play in 
  mapping an overall development framework for the region. It will then be up 
  to AMCEN to ensure that the African Union incorporates considerations of environmental 
  sustainability when selecting a broad development framework.</p>
