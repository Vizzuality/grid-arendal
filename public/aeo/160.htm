<h3><a name="img2e5"></a>WATER QUALITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h3>
<p>Problems of water availability are worsened by the contamination of existing 
  supplies by pollution from various sources. Sugar cane production for example, 
  as well as consuming a high proportion of local water, is also a major polluter 
  of water aquifers, as a result of heavy use of chemical fertilizers. Irrigation 
  of other crops also contributes to the contamination of surface water and groundwater 
  resources, through chemical residues, increased silt loads and higher salt concentrations. 
  As rivers and estuaries are drying up, and as nitrate and phosphate levels increase, 
  so they are engulfed by algal blooms and dense mats of water hyacinth (<i>Eichornia 
  crassipes</i>). Sewage, wastewater and solid waste dumping are significant contributors 
  to pollution of groundwater, especially in Mauritius (Institute for Environmental 
  & Legal Studies 1998). Some aquifers have nitrate levels of 50 milligrams/litre 
  (mg/l), a level considered a risk to health (Jootun, Bhikajee, Prayag and Soyfoo 
  1997). This is ecologically detrimental, removing nutrients and dissolved oxygen 
  from the water, and elevating the level of toxins in the water so that it becomes 
  unfit for consumption.</p>
<p>Saline intrusion from the sea is also contaminating underground freshwater 
  supplies in various parts of the sub-region. Sources of industrial pollution 
  include: textile factories; fish processing plants; breweries; and tanneries. 
  In Port Louis in Mauritius, industrial effluent is only pretreated before it 
  is discharged into the sea at only 800 metres (m) from the shore (Institute 
  for Environmental & Legal Studies 1998). Just along the coast, at the Coromandel 
  industrial zone, untreated effluent is discharged only 600 m out to sea, and 
  has caused the death of the coral reef opposite Pointe aux Sables (Institute 
  for Environmental & Legal Studies 1998). In Madagascar, industrial wastewater 
  receives little treatment, and pollution control legislation does not exist 
  (ONE and INSTAT 1994, ONE 1997). There is no wastewater treatment system in 
  Comoros, and most effluent eventually ends up in the sea (UNEP 1999b).</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p> Improving water availability and quality is now a priority for the sub-region. 
  Water desalination is practised in Seychelles and Mauritius, and Mauritius has 
  a series of projects geared to increasing the volume and quality of water supply 
  in its National Environmental Action Plan (GOM/ERM 1998). Projects for increasing 
  reservoirs and sewage treatment works, and the rehabilitation of old, leaking 
  water systems, are in hand. Metering and charging for water use by volume is 
  being introduced in the region. Legislation for environmental and water protection 
  is in place in most countries. Recycling domestic wastewater for commercial 
  users is projected. Education and sensitization programmes with schools and 
  the media have been introduced (UNEP 1999b). It has yet to be seen whether these 
  separate efforts will be effective in the absence of an integrated sub-regionwide 
  policy framework. The extent of the worsening situation appears to have been 
  underestimated.</p>
