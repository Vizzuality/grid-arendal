<h1>CHAPTER 1 </h1>
<h4>ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA: 1972-2002 </h4>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Chapter 1 of the <i>Africa Environment Outlook</i> (AEO) provides an overview 
  of developments in Africa, particularly over the three decades up to 2002. It 
  highlights social and economic policies and programmes which have impacted on 
  the environment, and which have influenced various policy responses. </p>

<p><a name="fig11"></a>While the chapter focuses mainly on the 30 years since 
  the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment-which laid the foundation 
  for international action on the environment-it also reviews some of the developments 
  before 1972 which had a major bearing on Africa's political economy. Such developments 
  include: the slave trade; colonization; decolonization; and the struggle for 
  independence. This historical background information serves to place the evolution 
  of environmental management in Africa in its proper perspective.</p>
<p>Social, economic and environmental issues in Africa are discussed in three 
  major sections, each covering approximately one decade, namely: the 1970s; the 
  1980s; and the 1990s and beyond. </p>
<p>The section on the 1970s also deals with some developments before 1972, including: 
  colonization; decolonization; and the establishment of the Organization of African 
  Unity (OAU) in 1963. The legal and institutional framework for environmental 
  management is also covered.</p>
<p>The section on the 1980s highlights the economic decline of Africa, including: 
  the debt problem; famine in the mid-1980s; and African attempts at revival, 
  with the adoption of the Lagos Plan of Action at the beginning of the decade. 
  The creation in 1985 of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment 
  (AMCEN) and the work of the World Commission on Environment and Development 
  (WCED) are also highlighted. The WCED popularized the concept of sustainable 
  development. By embracing both sustainable development and the World Conservation 
  Strategy, which spawned many national conservation strategies, Africa has claimed 
  its position as a major global player at the international level in terms of 
  environmental management.</p>
<p>The section on the 1990s and beyond lowers the curtains on the decolonization 
  process, with the abolition of apartheid in South Africa and the creation of 
  a new political dispensation. The section also covers the end of the Cold War, 
  which had made the region a theatre for both Western and Soviet geopolitical 
  games. The 1990s also saw the evolution of new political systems in many African 
  countries. In terms of the environment, many countries adopted new constitutions, 
  which enshrined environmental rights. The section looks at the impact of the 
  1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), and at 
  preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in South 
  Africa later in 2002.</p>
