<h4>Culture</h4>
<p>Culture and the natural environment are strongly linked. Cultural practices, 
  values, norms and language often reflect the diversity of natural resources 
  upon which people depend for their livelihoods, and the strategies they use 
  to extract these resources. Africa holds many strongly traditional cultures. 
  They can serve both as bulwarks against outside influences and as conduits through 
  which new ideas are assimilated, through translation and representation in established 
  idioms. Cultural norms and values shape people's perceptions, aspirations and 
  attitudes and, thereby, their actions. Cultures often include mechanisms which 
  regulate access to, and patterns of use and consumption of, natural resources. 
  Most of all, culture strongly influences the choices that people make. Among 
  the many elements comprising a culture, religious and linguistic elements, and 
  ethnic groups living within that culture, can-and do, at times-cause changes 
  in its total configuration. As in some other parts of the world, religion in 
  Africa serves as a strong unifying force in some areas, and as a potentially 
  divisive one in others. Ethnic tensions, driven by historical animosities-themselves 
  often exacerbated by religious, economic and social tensions-are also potentially 
  divisive and inhibitory to development. In contrast, religion can promote social 
  coherence and support within communities, thereby encouraging self-reliance 
  and development.</p>
<p>With a plurality of peoples and languages, Africa has a rich traditional culture. 
  For many peoples of Africa, the systems of social governance, provision of services, 
  maintenance of social cohesion and even economic development have been based 
  on the norms that these cultures have allowed. The advent of other cultures 
  in the region has led to some form of competition between cultures, and the 
  assimilation of different cultures into a dominant culture. Traditional African 
  cultures have been most affected, while the imported Islamic culture has merely 
  suffered some damage. Today, traditional support systems, which served as social 
  securities for all members of society, including the aged, the homeless, the 
  sick and the poor, have more than crumbled and have not been replaced by efficient 
  structures. Of course, traditional systems of governance have disappeared almost 
  completely. They are being replaced by 'democratic ethics', which are being 
  intermingled with tribal and ethnic sentiments and loyalties, and religious 
  strives. Many Africans today are entangled in the influences of these cultures, 
  but the influence of westernization has become very pervading.</p>
<p>Culture is not static, especially in this era of increasing globalization. 
  People around the world are being exposed more and more to the norms and values 
  of other cultures, sometimes creating tensions with their own culture and, in 
  many instances, resulting in substantial modification or replacement of some 
  of its elements. Consumption patterns in many parts of Africa are increasingly 
  being modelled on a western-style consumer culture. This influences both trading 
  and investment patterns, particularly by creating a demand for imported consumer 
  goods while, at the same time, serving as an incentive for some of the multinational 
  corporations to enter local markets directly through investment, partnerships 
  or takeovers. A shift from selfsufficiency to a cash economy, and new patterns 
  of accumulation of wealth, can bring unforeseen changes. This, in turn, can 
  affect cultural values, as communities lose contact with the resources that 
  were so important in determining many of their livelihoods and practices. These 
  factors (changes in traditional patterns of access and management, as well as 
  a diminishing natural resource base) can become sources of conflict, as well 
  as culture change.</p>
<p>Western life styles are becoming increasingly commonplace. So, too, are western 
  values, which continue to overshadow existing African cultures. However, dogmatic 
  following of the consumer culture will reach a peak, and people will begin to 
  see the difference between needs and wants. Effective utilization and channelling 
  of these ideas and ideals will lead to healthier lifestyles and to the promotion 
  of alternatives to traditional families ties, which are breaking down. The emphasis 
  on meeting human needs rather than wants will lead to the elimination of religion 
  and ethnicity as divisive forces in African development. The introduction of 
  a culture of peace will bring lasting solutions to various forms of conflicts 
  in Africa. This cultural revival will constitute a crucial fulcrum for the African 
  renaissance, and its effects will soon become noticeable on the environment.</p>
