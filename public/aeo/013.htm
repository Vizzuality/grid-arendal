<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA</h3>
<p>Five years after the OAU was established, African countries adopted the African 
  Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, in Algiers in 
  September 1968. The main objective of the Algiers Convention was to encourage 
  individual and joint action for the conservation, utilization and development 
  of soil, water, flora and fauna, for the present and future welfare of humankind.</p>
<p>The main principle of the Algiers Convention states: 'The contracting states 
  shall undertake to adopt the measures necessary to ensure conservation, utilization 
  and development of soil, water, floral and faunal resources in accordance with 
  scientific principles and with due regard to the best interests of the people.' 
</p>
<p>The Algiers Convention also demands that parties undertake to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adopt effective measures to conserve and improve the soil; and to control 
    erosion and land use;</li>
  <li>establish policies to conserve, utilize and develop water resources; to 
    prevent pollution; and to control water use;</li>
  <li>protect flora and ensure its best utilization; ensure good management of 
    forests; and control burning, land clearance and overgrazing;</li>
  <li>conserve fauna resources and use them wisely; manage populations and habitats; 
    control hunting, capture and fishing; and prohibit the use of poisons, explosives 
    and automatic weapons in hunting;</li>
  <li>tightly control traffic in trophies, in order to prevent trade in illegally 
    killed and illegally obtained trophies; and</li>
  <li>reconcile customary rights with the convention. </li>
</ul>
<p>Well after the Algiers Convention, the modern environmental agenda-which was 
  first set at the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment- also shaped 
  environmental policies and programmes in the region. For example, African governments 
  have responded positively through policy implementation to global, regional 
  and sub-regional environmental problems and challenges, although the success 
  of policy implementation has varied from one sub-region to another. At the national 
  level, the Stockholm Conference influenced the establishment of the first environment 
  ministry in 1975 in what was then Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). 
  More environment ministries have been established in other African countries 
  over the past three decades. At the global level, the Stockholm Conference led 
  to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with 
  its headquarters in Nairobi.</p>
<p>The global environmental, political, economic and social issues of the 1960s 
  and early 1970s influenced the preparations for, and the final decisions of, 
  the 1972 Stockholm Conference. For Africa, the Stockholm Declaration on the 
  Human Environment stands out as the defining document in terms of 'soft law' 
  on environment and development issues. The Stockholm Declaration laid the foundation 
  in terms of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environmental rights.</li>
  <li>Environmental education.</li>
  <li>The sovereign rights of states to 'exploit their own resources', in terms 
    of their own environmental policies and their responsibility to ensure that 
    activities in their territory do not harm the environment of other states.</li>
  <li>Calling for the 'elimination and complete destruction' of nuclear weapons 
    and 'all other means of mass destruction'.</li>
  <li>Speaking strongly against 'apartheid, racial segregation, discrimination, 
    colonial and other forms of oppression and foreign domination'.</li>
  <li>Highlighting nature conservation, including wildlife, as important in planning 
    for economic development.</li>
  <li>The sustainable utilization of non-renewable resources, to ensure that they 
    benefit all humankind.</li>
  <li>Recognizing the importance of 'substantial quantities of financial and technological 
    assistance' to developing countries, in order to tackle environmental deficiencies 
    caused by underdevelopment and natural disasters.</li>
  <li>The need for environmental policies of all countries to enhance, and not 
    to adversely affect, the present or future development potential of developing 
    countries.</li>
  <li>Rational planning to reconcile any conflict between the needs of development 
    and the need to protect and improve the environment.</li>
  <li>Appropriate demographic policies 'which are without prejudice to basic human 
    rights'.</li>
  <li>The application of science and technology to identify, avoid and control 
    environmental risks. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="box12"></a>The 1972 Stockholm Conference rekindled the African spirit 
  of living in harmony with each other and with the environment, as was stated 
  by Professor Mostafa K. Tolba (who later became the second UNEP executive director) 
  at that conference (see <a href="#box12">Box 1.2</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the Algiers Convention, African countries are party to some 
  of the following international agreements, which were adopted in the 1970s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 1971 Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as 
    Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar).</li>
  <li>The 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and 
    Natural Heritage (World Heritage).</li>
  <li>The 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
    Fauna and Flora (CITES).</li>
  <li>The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals 
    (CMS).</li>
