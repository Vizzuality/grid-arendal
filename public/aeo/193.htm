<h2>CENTRAL AFRICA </h2>
<p>Central Africa is predominantly covered in forest and savanna. The coastal 
  humid belt, with high and relatively constant rainfall, supports dense tropical 
  forests, whereas the northern parts of Cameroon, Central African Republic and 
  Chad are drier, with more variable rainfall, and the dominant vegetation is 
  savanna. Land use in the sub-region is sensitive to climatic and vegetation 
  characteristics, with forestry and commercial plantation agriculture largely 
  found in the humid zones (where rainfall reaches up to 4000 mm/yr), and livestock 
  rearing, with some subsistence cultivation, in the semi-arid zones (where rainfall 
  averages 500 mm/yr). The semi-arid zone is also highly vulnerable to climatic 
  variations and drought, which limit agricultural expansion. Soils are highly 
  vulnerable to erosion, because most of the rainfall occurs in intense heavy 
  storms, and because the clay and silt content makes the soils prone to crusting 
  when exposed (Njinyam 1998).</p>
<p>Approximately 8 per cent of the total area is currently used for arable and 
  permanent crops (with Cameroon having the largest share, at 15 per cent of its 
  land area), and 16.5 per cent is used as permanent pasture (FAOSTAT 2001). Irrigated 
  agriculture is limited, partly because the fertile soils and the high, reliable 
  rainfall in the humid zone are conducive to rain-fed agriculture, and partly 
  because the infrastructure development required to establish irrigated cultivation 
  in the semi-arid zone has so far been prohibitively expensive. Despite these 
  favourable conditions in central Africa, large-scale agricultural development 
  has been limited by national market failures and international trade barriers. 
  Shifting cultivation (or slash-and-burn agriculture) was a traditional means 
  of coping with variability, but this practice is no longer sustainable, because 
  there are much larger populations now requiring land. The priority issues in 
  central Africa are, therefore: improving food security, through enhanced production 
  and distribution of resources; and reducing the pressures that shifting cultivation 
  has on forests and woodlands.</p>
<h3>IMPORTANCE OF CULTIVATION AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION IN CENTRAL AFRICA </h3>
<p>In 1970, 81 per cent of Central Africa's labour force was employed in agriculture, 
  with Chad having the highest at 92 per cent. By 1980, the percentage had fallen 
  to 74 and, in 1990, the average was 68 per cent (World Bank 2001). The reasons 
  for this decline include population growth exceeding agricultural expansion, 
  and industrial development. Pastures account for much of the agriculturally 
  productive land in the Sahel, and pastoralists and agropastoralists are integral 
  parts of local and regional economies. It was estimated in 1995 that there were 
  more than 404 000 pastoralists in Chad (about 15 per cent of the country's population), 
  with pasture areas covering about 55 percent of the national territory (FEWS 
  1995).</p>
<p>The major crops in the sub-region include: cassava; cocoa; coffee; cotton; 
  groundnuts; maize; millet; palm oil; rubber; and sorghum. In 1980, the total 
  value of agricultural exports for the region was US$1 148 million, although 
  Cameroon took the lion's share at US$699 million. In 1990, exports fell to just 
  US$909 million, mainly as a result of commodity price fluctuations (World Bank 
  2001). By 1997, however, markets had recovered in most countries, although the 
  war in Democratic Republic of Congo had an enormous impact on its agricultural 
  exports and, as a result, totals for the sub-region were just US$796 million 
  (World Bank 2001). Value added in agriculture in 1980 ranged from 40 per cent 
  of GDP in Chad to just 12 per cent in Gabon (World Bank 2001). In 1990, the 
  percentage for Chad fell to 24 whilst, in Democratic Republic of Congo, the 
  percentage contribution of agriculture to GDP has climbed from 27 in 1980 to 
  58 in 1999, mainly due to other economic activities having been disrupted due 
  to the war (World Bank 2001).</p>
