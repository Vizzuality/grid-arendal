<h4><i>Coastal and marine environments</i></h4>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Africa</i></p>
<p>Coastal and marine environments are relatively rich, in terms of resources 
  and economic opportunities. Consequently, in the Market Forces scenario, they 
  come under greater pressure, as more people seek to take advantage of those 
  opportunities. Environmental degradation-characterized by the loss of coastal 
  barrier communities, such as: coral reefs, mangroves and other plants; coastal 
  erosion; pollution; and the depletion of fish stocks-is widespread in areas 
  where development is unregulated. In other areas, where careful coastal-zone 
  planning is implemented and maintained, the high environmental qualities of 
  these ecosystems are maintained, and sustainable benefits accrue. In particular, 
  opportunities for properly managed tourism development create both the incentives 
  and the money needed for managing these coastal and marine resources.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Central 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The coastal and marine resources exploitation by the private sector increases 
  erosion and the destruction of mangrove swamps.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  <i></i>Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>A rapidly growing tourism industry and affluence lead to extensive development 
  of resorts on the beaches. Governments recognize the importance of coastal resources, 
  and move in to strictly regulate the developments at the coast. Sensitive ecosystems 
  at the coast are gazetted for protection. Discharge of effluents into these 
  ecosystems is strictly controlled. There is the capacity and the institutional 
  framework to monitor coastal development. Marine resources harvesting is regulated 
  through licensing and policing procedures.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p> The growth in population numbers and densities along the coasts of the Mediterranean 
  Sea increases marine pollution. Untreated wastewater is the main source of pollution, 
  causing eutrophication in coastal waters. In addition to high pollution densities, 
  other risks to the coastal zone and to marine life are: the oil mining industry; 
  marine tourism; and the large increases in the numbers of ships visiting the 
  ports, as the sub-region opens up to free trading with the global market. The 
  increased population puts more demand on fish, which is sometimes caught using 
  illegal methods, such as using poisons.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Some 13 of the 16 countries of this sub-region have access to the Atlantic 
  Ocean. This may be both a blessing and a curse. The curse could be the temptation 
  by unscrupulous elements to dump all manner of hazardous wastes at sea. However, 
  in the Market Forces scenario, with vigilant governments of the sub-region working 
  together and with the ensured participation of corporate bodies, the seaways 
  are properly patrolled, and measures for cleaning up the coastlines are brought 
  into operation. Fishing is controlled, whilst ensuring that the fishing business 
  remains profitable for both the small fishermen and for corporate entities.</p>
<p> <img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  <i>West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Coastal waters become increasingly polluted and overfished. The coral lagoons 
  become salt-water, deadsand seas, devoid of aquatic life. Uncontrolled highspeed 
  motor watersports dominate the scene, and add to the oil and noise pollution 
  of the areas. Deep-sea fishing is industrialized and internationalized. The 
  region fails to establish territorial command of the oceans to which it has 
  legitimate claims, and the poorer countries sell their rights, thus undermining 
  the potential for regional negotiations. Lack of international policing gives 
  rise to commercial security protection and to violent piracy, with continual 
  armed disputes, disrupting other sea trade.</p>
