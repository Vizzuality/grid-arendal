<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies</h4>
<p>African countries are faced with the dual challenge of meeting economic development 
  needs without increasing dependence on fossil fuels or inefficient technologies 
  while simultaneously mitigating the diverse and complex impacts of climate change. 
  All African countries, with the exceptions of Angola, Liberia and Somalia, have 
  ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
  and its proposed mechanism for implementation, the Kyoto Protocol, agreed in 
  Bonn, in 2001, by 180 countries from all over the world.</p>
<p>African countries stand to benefit from the Kyoto Protocol and from the funding 
  streams it proposes, namely the Special Climate Change Fund and the fund for 
  Least Developed Countries. Under the Protocol's mechanisms, developed countries 
  will be able to offset some of their emissions by paying for carbon-saving projects 
  such as tree planting and forest conservation schemes in developing countries. 
  Funds will also be available to help developing countries to convert to cleaner 
  technologies such as solar and wind power or fuel-cell-operated vehicles, currently 
  too expensive for many African nations. Additional funds will be available to 
  assist developing countries in adapting and mitigating the impacts of climate 
  change by means, for example, of flood defence systems and appropriate infrastructure 
  design. Many countries (including Algeria, Botswana, Cape Verde, Côte D'Ivoire, 
  Egypt, Ghana, Lesotho, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa 
  and Zimbabwe) have embarked on National Communications Strategies to provide 
  detailed inventories of emissions and carbon dioxide 'sinks' and programmes 
  to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In both Northern and Southern Africa, 
  options for further exploitation of alternative sources of energy (for example, 
  solar, wind, micro-hydro, geothermal and biomass) are being explored as additional 
  means to combat climate change.</p>
