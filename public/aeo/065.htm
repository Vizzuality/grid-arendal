<h3>SPECIES LOSS </h3>
<p>Individual species are under threat from a variety of pressures in addition 
  to loss of their natural habitat. Recent estimates show that a total of 126 
  recorded animal species have become extinct (or extinct from the wild) in Africa, 
  and that there are 2 018 threatened animal species across the region. One-hundred 
  and twenty-three plants are recorded as extinct and 1 771 are threatened (IUCN 
  1997).</p>
<p>The reasons for such high rates of species loss or endangerment include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>habitat loss;</li>
  <li>illegal hunting for food;</li>
  <li>medicinal, or commercial use; and</li>
  <li>national and international trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent study found that the bushmeat trade in Central and Western Africa 
  is contributing significantly to the decline in populations of gorillas, chimpanzees, 
  elephants, bush pigs and forest antelopes. Bushmeat is a traditional supplement 
  to the diets of many African communities, but the increasing human populations 
  and commercial trade are pressurizing these species to the extent of a million 
  tonnes of bushmeat a year (Greenwire 2001). Bushmeat is now a major source of 
  animal protein in many towns and cities in tropical Africa (Fa, Garcia Yuste 
  & Castello, 2000). In addition, activities such as logging and mining are improving 
  access to previously remote areas, making collection from the wild more profitable. 
  A recent study showed that road density is linked to habitat fragmentation, 
  deforestation, and intensified bushmeat hunting (Wilkie, Shaw, Rotberg, Morelli 
  & Auzel 2000).</p>

<p>Selective harvesting of medicinal plants is also taking its toll on species 
  diversity and abundance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 
  80 per cent of people in the developing world are reliant on traditional medicines. 
  Eighty-five per cent of these medicines use plant extracts, so it is estimated 
  that around 3 000 million people around the world rely on plants for traditional 
  health treatments. The number is even larger if plant-derived commercial drugs 
  are included (Sheldon and others 1997). In Africa, 80 per cent of both rural 
  and urban populations depend on medicinal plants for their health needs (and 
  those of their livestock) either because they prefer them for cultural or traditional 
  reasons, because such remedies are effective in treating certain diseases, or 
  because there is a lack of affordable alternatives (Baquar 1995, Ole Lengisugi 
  & Mziray 1996). Overharvesting of these plants from the wild and loss of their 
  habitat are threatening many species (as well as human and livestock health) 
  and alternative strategies such as cultivation of medicinal species in nurseries 
  are being considered (Dery & Otsyina 2000). The <i>Acacia senegal</i> tree is 
  another highly sought-after species because of the high economic value of the 
  gum arabic which it produces. The species has been commercially exploited, particularly 
  in Sudan (Abu-Zeid 1995).</p>
<p>The exotic pet trade is another powerful international driving force for species 
  reduction, as is demand for animal products such as ivory, rhino horn, skins, 
  furs, and other trophies. Many species are protected by restrictions on international 
  trade, but a thriving black market creates a demand, and extreme levels of poverty 
  tempt local people to meet it (CITES 2002).</p>

<p>Loss of species means loss of economic opportunities, both now and in the future. 
  For example, the possibility of developing new strains of drought- or disease-resistant 
  crops, crops with higher protein content, or synthetic manufacture of pharmaceutical 
  products of plant origin may be lost. Different breeds of livestock are also 
  important components of global biodiversity because they have genes that are 
  or may be useful for agricultural production. Locally adapted strains of livestock 
  often have greater potential for increased productivity, due to their ability 
  to thrive under specific conditions. For example, Botswana and Namibia have 
  the greatest proportional diversity of breeds but these indigenous breeds could 
  be threatened if the livestock husbandry systems under which they have been 
  developed are replaced or changed, or if exotic breeds or their semen are imported 
  under aid programmes or livestock development policies. Loss of traditional 
  livestock management regimes and the genetic diversity that they provide could 
  result in increases in the cost of food production in those areas (Hall & Ruane 
  1993, Hall & Bradley 1995). On the other hand, properly planned and managed 
  in situ conservation of livestock breeds could satisfy demands for intensified 
  production without the need for massive external inputs and foreign aid (Hall 
  & Bradley 1995).</p>
<p>Species loss or extinction can also affect local and regional communities either 
  because opportunities for tourism are lost or because of security problems arising 
  from heavy poaching. Local communities also lose valuable sources of food and 
  other raw materials, as well as losing irreplaceable cultural and spiritual 
  assets.</p>
<p>Ecological communities are impacted by species loss, as this affects predator/prey 
  relationships, and removes agents of pollination, seed dispersal or germination 
  such as insects, elephants, primates or other animals. Species loss reduces 
  the integrity of ecosystems in ways that are still far from being fully understood 
  and reduces the environment's capacity to regulate climate, water and soil quality.</p>
