<h2>THE 1970S -WINDS OF CHANGE </h2>
<h3>DECOLONIZATION </h3>
<p>The decolonization of Africa was described in the 1960s by the former British 
  Prime Minister Harold Macmillan as the 'winds of change'. Decolonization of 
  the region began in 1957, with the independence of Ghana. It gathered momentum 
  through the 1960s and beyond, to 1994 and the eradication of apartheid in South 
  Africa. </p>
<p>The momentum which fanned African nationalism strengthened relations between 
  former colonies, leading to stronger voices in favour of pan-Africanism. In 
  1963, the founding fathers of African independence established the OAU, whose 
  main objectives were to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>promote the unity and solidarity of African states; </li>
  <li>coordinate and intensify cooperation and efforts among African states, in 
    order to achieve a better life for the people; and </li>
  <li>defend the sovereignty of African states, their territorial integrity and 
    their independence. </li>
</ul>
<p>In many instances, independence did not mean political stability. Many countries 
  which gained independence in the late 1950s and the 1960s-such as Chad, Congo, 
  Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Somalia and Sudan-underwent phases 
  of political instability which, in some cases, have continued up to the present. 
  Major developments which took place in the 1970s, and which have influenced 
  policies in Africa, are listed in <a href="#tab11">Table 1.1</a>. </p>

<p>The Cold War is arguably one of the major events that had the greatest impact 
  on Africa, in terms of its socio-economic alliances and development. Environmental 
  management was generally not considered paramount during that period as it is 
  today, even though Africa has a long track record in terms of the sustainable 
  use of natural resources. The two dominant development paradigms during the 
  Cold War were capitalism and socialism. This sometimes led to tensions between 
  African countries, often resulting in armed conflict between them and civil 
  war in others. Armed conflict led to a refugee problem, which saw the number 
  of refugees grow from a low figure of 23 500 people at the end of the 1950s 
  to a high of about 50 million refugees at the end of the 1990s (UNHCR 2000). 
  Political unrest and the resultant refugee situation in many parts of Africa 
  during the past decades have led to many problems, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>deforestation, resulting from massive land clearance for agriculture and 
    fuelwood; </li>
  <li>rapid urbanization, particularly in coastal areas; </li>
  <li>widespread poverty; </li>
  <li>poor economic performance; </li>
  <li>trade policies which are not conducive towards peace and development; </li>
  <li>inadequate technology base to satisfy existing demand; </li>
  <li>increased civil strife; and </li>
  <li>growth in illegal trade in minerals and other natural resources. </li>
</ul>
