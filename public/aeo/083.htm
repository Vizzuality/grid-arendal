<p>Efforts have also been made to deal with invasive species. For example, the 
  Working for Water Programme was set up in 1995 to provide sustainable employment 
  through alien-clearing projects. There are currently over 300 projects which 
  have cleared over 235 000 hectares of alien-infested land, rehabilitated a further 
  50 000 hectares, and employed 21 000 people in the year 2000 Working for Water 
  2000). Countries affected by water hyacinth have initiated biological and chemical 
  control programmes in addition to mechanical clearance, with some success to 
  date (Global Water Partnership 2000).</p>
<p>The positive trends in biodiversity conservation in the sub-region are partly 
  attributed to the fact that all countries in Southern Africa have ratified the 
  Convention on Biological Diversity, the Bonn Convention, and the Ramsar Convention. 
  To a large extent the provisions of these conventions have also been included 
  in national policies. Furthermore, many Southern African governments have adopted 
  structured approaches to decentralizing management of natural resources through 
  Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) programmes. CBNRM programmes 
  have helped to extend resource access and management rights over the last 15 
  years to farmers operating in some communal lands. This has resulted in rural 
  farming communities deriving direct benefits from wildlife through returns from 
  either safari hunting or direct sales (Cumming 2000).</p>

<p><a name="img2b12"></a>Prominent CBNRM programmes in the sub-region include 
  Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources, hailed 
  for raising household incomes by as much as 15-25 per cent in CAMPFIRE-designated 
  areas since 1998 (CAMPFIRE & Africa Resources Trust 1999). Zambia's Administrative 
  Management Design for Game Areas (ADMADE), South Africa's Peace Parks initiative 
  and Namibia's Living In a Finite Environment (LIFE) are other successful CBNRM 
  programmes in the sub-region. The LIFE programme has seen local communities 
  reap substantial benefits from sales of thatching grass, crafts, tourism, and 
  trophy hunting. In the Kunene region, game guards are employed from the local 
  communities and Himba nomads, creating jobs and stimulating incomes whilst helping 
  to conserve wildlife. Public-private partnerships are being developed to ensure 
  conservation of threatened species in the Kafue wetlands of Zambia, whilst providing 
  a source of materials and income to local communities. Despite these successes, 
  some analysts have questioned whether these CBNRMcreated incentive structures 
  can promote a conservation ethic among rural residents. One study concluded 
  that it was increased enforcement activities and not any increased motivation 
  by residents to conserve animals which led to declines in poaching in Zimbabwe 
  and Zambia. It appears that poaching remains a problem in these areas (Gibson 
  1999). Indications are that CAMPFIRE may, in some cases, have been successful 
  in stimulating communities to secure rights to wildlife resources and may have 
  more influence over utilization of the resource. This may have allowed communities 
  to improve their agricultural infrastructure and equipment and to improve household 
  conditions (Murombedzi 2001). Whether this change in the community relationship 
  to the local authority will result in enhanced conservation of biodiversity 
  remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Governments and scientific institutions are slowly realizing the value of indigenous 
  knowledge and attempts are now being made to document and record what still 
  exists and to incorporate traditional conservation methods into modern ones. 
  For example, over 5 000 samples of mainly traditional food crop seed species 
  have been collected by states that are members of the Southern African Development 
  Community (SADC) for preservation at the sub-regional genetic resources centre 
  in Lusaka, Zambia. In addition, a Genome Resource Banking in Southern Africa 
  programme has been initiated and materials from many wildlife species, including 
  buffalo and rhino, have been banked. Plans are underway to include other species. 
  Many computer databases-increasingly being used as tools to develop biodiversity 
  inventories-have now been set up and placed on the Internet, including a meta-database 
  of resources, a fish database, and a database for threatened plants. The Southern 
  African Bird Atlas (Harrison, Allan, Underhill, Herremans, Tree & Brown 1997) 
  maps the distribution of bird records from across Southern Africa, providing 
  a major source of information against which conservation threats can be determined 
  or judged. Other responses to calls for greater documentation and application 
  of indigenous knowledge include policies to assign intellectual property rights 
  to certain countries, communities or individuals, and participation in the World 
  Bank's Programme on Indigenous Knowledge in Africa. Indigenous knowledge is 
  being used via this programme in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, through 
  the use of medicinal plants to treat secondary infections and community support 
  programmes that assist people living with AIDS to live positively and raise 
  modest incomes (World Bank 2001b).</p>
