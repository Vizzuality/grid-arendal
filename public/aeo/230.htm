<h3>WHAT IS CAUSING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN AFRICA? </h3>
<p>The causes of environmental change in Africa are both natural and man-made, 
  resulting from events and activities both within the region and external to 
  it. For example, climate variability is a natural phenomenon that has impacts 
  such as flooding and drought, but human activities such as deforestation and 
  cultivation of marginal areas contribute to its impacts on human lives, livelihoods, 
  economic growth and on the environment. Climate change is a result of anthropogenic 
  GHG emissions largely from countries outside of Africa, but the impacts of climate 
  change on Africa need to be mitigated to conserve African resources (human, 
  economic and environmental).</p>
<p>In many cases it is not just one force that causes a single environmental change 
  but a complex interaction of forces often seemingly unconnected in time and/or 
  space. It is also clear that some forces have impacts that are particularly 
  relevant to the themes discussed in this chapter, and as such should be addressed 
  as priorities. The most important of are listed here and are discussed more 
  fully below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Population growth, urbanization and increasing consumption</li>
  <li>Economic pressures</li>
  <li>Food production systems</li>
  <li>Energy needs and transport systems</li>
  <li>Loss of indigenous knowledge and practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Population growth, </b>urbanization and increasing consumption are putting 
  pressure on the environment through growing demand for resources such as freshwater 
  the produce of agriculture, forestry and fisheries energy and space for housing 
  and recreational facilities. These forces also exert pressure on the environment 
  in terms of the large and growing volumes of waste and pollution they give rise 
  to. In urban areas, environmental impacts are concentrated in small areas, making 
  the surrounding ecosystems, resources and vast numbers of people highly vulnerable. 
  Development and implementation of population policies is therefore a priority 
  to ensure that population growth and urbanization patterns are in line with 
  economic growth, resource constraints, employment opportunities, and infrastructure 
  development.</p>
<p><b>Economic pressures</b> include government policies to bring more land under 
  cultivation, to grant more logging concessions and fishing agreements, and to 
  promote industrial development, thereby encouraging economic growth and earnings 
  of foreign exchange. These practices are driving environmental change because 
  they encourage unsustainable rates of resource use or extraction. For example, 
  Africa's forests are being felled and timber exported at a rate that exceeds 
  the forest's natural rate of regeneration. Forest areas are declining rapidly 
  as a result. Similarly, fishing rights have been granted to foreign fishing 
  companies that are harvesting resources faster than the natural population-replacement 
  rate and fish stocks are declining as a result. These activities need to be 
  managed in a more sustainable manner so that benefits can continue to accrue 
  to African countries in the long term. To achieve this, the economic base needs 
  to be broadened to lessen the pressure on natural resources.</p>
<p><b>Food production</b> <b>systems</b> are driving environmental change as an 
  indirect result of population and economic pressures. Because there are more 
  people to feed, and because there are pressures for economic growth through 
  export of agricultural produce, commercial food production systems are being 
  transformed to low input, monospecific cultivation with one or two harvests 
  per year. This rapidly exhausts the soil of nutrients and lowers productivity 
  in the long term. At the subsistence level, farmers are forced to cultivate 
  or graze more and more marginal land as there is greater competition for land 
  from different users. This causes yields to decline and makes resources more 
  vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, environmental degradation, 
  and desertification. The development of population policies, broadening of the 
  economic base, and promotion of soil and vegetation conservation measures would 
  alleviate the pressure from food production systems on the environment and increase 
  food security.</p>
<p><b>The energy and transport sectors</b> in Africa are also significant drivers 
  of environmental change in a number of areas. For example, the transport sector 
  is a major contributor of emissions that are harmful to human health as well 
  as to the atmosphere and to terrestrial ecosystems. Centralized power generation 
  using fossil fuels is a problem in South Africa and Northern African countries, 
  contributing to atmospheric pollution and climate change. In Eastern and Western 
  Africa, hydropower is one of the main sources of electricity. This has a different 
  set of environmental problems associated with it, including inundation of land 
  and displacement of people, disruption of ecosystems, and exacerbation of flooding. 
  A much more widespread problem associated with energy sources in Africa is the 
  use of wood, charcoal and other traditional fuels at the household level. This 
  not only results in high rates of deforestation but also raises the risk of 
  acute respiratory diseases from inhalation of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, 
  carbon monoxide and soot particles. Alternative energy sources need to be developed 
  in the near future to reduce dependence on traditional fuels and keep emissions 
  and other environmental impacts to a minimum.</p>
<p><b>Loss of indigenous knowledge and practices</b> is causing environmental 
  change because it results in changes in patterns of land and resource use, obscuring 
  of conservation measures, and foreclosing of opportunities for commercial development 
  of resources. For example, knowledge of the medicinal properties of Africa's 
  plant species could be used in commercial pharmaceutical production, but lack 
  of recognition or documentation of this knowledge is impeding this. Likewise, 
  indigenous plant species that are drought tolerant could be bred and used in 
  commercial agriculture and traditional practices of agro-forestry and intercropping 
  could be adopted to promote soil conservation. Further resources need to be 
  channeled into research and documentation of indigenous knowledge in order to 
  realize its potential in Africa's development.</p>
