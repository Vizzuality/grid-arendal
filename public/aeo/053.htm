<h2>CENTRAL AFRICA</h2>
<p>Central Africa is faced with similar challenges to other sub-regions in terms 
  of climate variability: periodic extreme weather events, impacts of climate 
  change on food production, sea level rise, and localized air quality problems 
  in urban areas. These challenges are partly natural and require effective impact 
  mitigation strategies but they are, in some cases, also exacerbated by human 
  activities and thus require an integrated environmental management approach.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>Rainfall and temperature patterns in Central Africa vary considerably, with 
  unpredictable seasonal variations. Rainfall is relatively high and reliable 
  over the central and coastal parts of the sub-region but tends to diminish and 
  become more variable towards the north. For example, Douala, in coastal Cameroon, 
  has an average rainfall of 3 850 mm/yr while Djamena, in Chad, receives only 
  500 mm/yr, and suffers periodic drought. Temperatures in the lowlying coastal 
  forests vary little because persistent cloud keeps mean annual temperatures 
  between 26&deg;C and 28&deg;C. In the high-relief mountainous areas, mean annual 
  temperatures are low, between 19&deg;C and 24&deg;C. In the semi-arid zone of 
  Cameroon and Chad, clear skies lead to strong insolation during the day and 
  massive heat losses by emission of longer wavelength radiation at night.</p>
<p>Droughts in the Central African Sahelian zone have become more frequent since 
  the late 1960s, and food security is declining, particularly among the poor 
  who are forced to cultivate marginal lands and are unable to accumulate food 
  reserves (IPCC 1998). Flooding is common in the more humid areas of Central 
  Africa, especially where forests and natural vegetation have been cleared for 
  cultivation or human settlements.</p>
<p>In the past 30 years, development policies and activities such as commercial 
  logging, commercial or subsistence agriculture, and collection of firewood have 
  led to extensive clearing of forests in Central Africa. These changes have disturbed 
  the sub-region's microclimate, increasing vulnerability to rainfall fluctuations. 
  Furthermore, the dense humid tropical forests of the sub-region are important 
  sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (more so than forests of equal area in 
  temperate zones). Reduction in their area therefore limits carbon sequestration 
  and thus contributes to global climate change. Reduction of vegetation cover 
  also exposes the soil and worsens the impacts of drought and flooding.</p>
<h4>Strategies for coping with climate variability in Central Africa</h4>
<p>Central African countries have ratified the UNCCD, and Chad has also produced 
  a National Action Plan. The Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control 
  in the Sahel (CILSS) has developed a sub-regional action plan to combat desertification 
  (UNCCD 2001). CILSS and the Club du Sahel have also developed a new vision for 
  food security in the Sahel, and have established a Food Crisis Prevention network 
  to improve coordination between countries.</p>
