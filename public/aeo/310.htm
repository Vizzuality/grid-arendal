<h5>Land </h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, there is increased equitable access to land. 
  Furthermore, conflicts over land-based resources are reduced, and there is amicable 
  resolution of any conflicts that do arise. Major rehabilitation of marginal 
  and degraded lands have taken place, and there is planned development and rational 
  land use-within countries and within the region. Land markets open up (including 
  purchasing land in any country), rural-urban disparity decreases and there is 
  greater incentive for sustainable land use. Opportunity costs for environmentally 
  benign use of the land are recompensed. Environmental management is applied 
  to ecosystems (that is, watersheds) within the regions, and is not restricted 
  by national political considerations. National boundaries become less significant 
  -nomadic and pastoralist communities are allowed greater movement across borders 
  (returning to traditional practices) without any hindrances whatever.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>Land tenures are improved and facilitated by simple and cheaper procedures. 
  Regional development plans are drawn up, updated and applied. Agricultural production 
  is better improved, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for domestic and 
  foreign markets.</p>

  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>Implementation of land reform policies and the emergence of a land market see 
  more value being attached to land and a significant decrease in land degradation, 
  as individuals take deliberate measures to maintain productivity of their land 
  parcels. The emergence of an active land market, however, means that the poor 
  segment of society is pushed off the prime land into marginal areas, or to seek 
  employment on land owned by the rich. Increased productivity on the sustainably 
  utilized land, however, ensures food security in the sub-region, and an increase 
  in land-based income means that more people-even those without land, but with 
  employment-are able to afford food.</p>

<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the diversification of the economies lowers 
  the high demand on specific natural resources, including land. As the role which 
  industry plays in the economy increases, the demand on agricultural land is 
  significantly reduced. In addition, the traditional role that agriculture used 
  to play changes, as farmers switch to growing cash crops. The adoption of modern 
  irrigation techniques, replacing chemical fertilizers and pesticides with organic 
  types, economizing on water use and using better-quality water all help to maintain 
  the sustainability of agricultural land. Due attention is given to the problems 
  of drought and soil erosion, and new land stabilization techniques are introduced.</p>

  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Issues of inappropriate land tenure, inequitable access to land, and land degradation 
  remain dominant in Southern Africa in the Great Transitions scenario. However, 
  growth in the adoption of democratic systems of governance may result in a more 
  secure system of land tenure, resulting in the creation of a sense of ownership, 
  and in a decrease in levels of land degradation. On the other hand, improvements 
  in agricultural technologies, and the provision of adequate extension services, 
  result in higher agricultural yields- and a step towards achieving food security. 
  Emphasis is also given to agricultural practices which have the greatest possible 
  potential, implying that total subregional food security is achieved through 
  trade.</p>

<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, after years of 'trial and error' practices 
  based on traditional and colonial legacies, a major transition towards modern 
  land use policy has begun. Land belongs to the people. Appropriate governing 
  structures are put into place, in which governments, investors and the people 
  consult and reach agreements on the uses to which a given piece of land are 
  put. All sides benefit and, therefore, do everything to protect the land as 
  partners. This reduces conflicts in the sub-region.</p>

<p>The new wave of government policies on land are warmly greeted by the international 
  community, and the sub-region is duly rewarded for its about turn on conservation.</p>
