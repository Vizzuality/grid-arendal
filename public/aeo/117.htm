<a name="img2c9"></a>The total length of coastline of Central African countries 
is 1 789 km, the area of the continental shelf to a depth of 200m is 66 500 km<sup>2</sup>, 
and the EEZ extends over 537 900 km<sup>2</sup>. Central Africa's coastal zone 
is characterized by lagoons, mangroves, seagrass beds, sandy beaches, and estuarine 
wetlands constituting vital resources for subsistence activities and for economic 
development. 
<p>With large human settlements and major economic activities along its coast, 
  Central Africa is one of the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise. Current 
  patterns of coastal erosion are exacerbating the problem and many of the unique 
  coastal wetland habitats are under threat. Pollution from land- and sea-based 
  sources is also a priority issue, particularly with the potential expansion 
  of offshore oil and gas production activities.</p>
<h3>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS IN 
  CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>Central Africa's coastal belt is an area of significant commercial activity 
  including mining, agricultural plantations and industrial developments. The 
  belt is experiencing rapid urbanization as a result of these activities. Offshore 
  economic resources, including petroleum and gas, are also significant and the 
  Central African countries of Cameroon, Congo, and Gabon are among the top net 
  oil-exporting countries in Africa. Despite political turmoil in Central Africa, 
  the region has seen offshore and inland crude oil production rise from 650 000 
  barrels per day (bbl/d) in 1993 to 875 000 bbl/d in 1998. The largest increases 
  in those years were in Equatorial Guinea, Congo, and Gabon. Central Africa's 
  proven gas reserves (about 3 per cent of the continent's total) are concentrated 
  in Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Central Africa accounted for 
  less than 1 per cent of Africa's natural gas production in 1997, but plans are 
  under way to increase production and utilization of gas in national electricity 
  generation (EIA 1999). This could have implications for marine environments, 
  particularly in terms of habitat degradation and pollution.</p>
<p>Commercial fisheries are also important resources for the coastal nations of 
  Central Africa, although the FAO considers stocks of demersal fish (i.e. living 
  close to the sea bottom) to be either close to or fully exploited (FAO 1997). 
  It has recommended that efforts to catch these species be reduced or re-directed, 
  to relieve pressure on the inshore zone and on juveniles. Similarly, catches 
  of small pelagics (i.e. open sea species) in the west and central Gulf of Guinea 
  were considered to be fully exploited, although further south, small pelagic 
  stocks are underexploited (FAO 1997). Pelagic fish abundance around the coast 
  is largely controlled by variability in intensity of coastal upwelling and nutrient 
  levels (FAO 1997). Coastal Central African countries are experiencing similar 
  problems to those in Western Africa with exploitation of their waters by foreign 
  fleets (FAO 1997). There is an urgent need to tighten agreements and to enforce 
  regulations in order to protect national interests, local economies and subsistence 
  livelihoods.</p>
