<h3>INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE AND PROPERTY RIGHTS </h3>
<p>Efforts to protect and conserve Africa's biodiversity are constrained by a 
  lack of research into and documentation of the continent's biodiversity. This 
  is especially true regarding indigenous knowledge of, for example, the properties 
  of selected species and their traditional uses and of natural resource management 
  and conservation practices. The relatively low level of knowledge in the science 
  of biodiversity has resulted from a lack of investment in research and development, 
  compounded in some cases by a failure to assign monetary values to the ecological 
  functions of plant and animal species, thus fostering the belief that natural 
  resources are free and in unlimited supply.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge has two main results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>conservation efforts are constrained by lack of understanding of species 
    and ecological systems; and</li>
  <li>opportunities for commercial exploitation and economic gains are missed 
    or are taken up by international companies without the benefits returning 
    to the original holders of the knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some efforts have been made to address this situation. In recent years, influential 
  publications have increasingly helped to improve understanding by emphasizing 
  the links between cultural diversity and biological diversity, by describing 
  how indigenous peoples use their knowledge to manage their natural resources, 
  including plants and animals (Warren 1995). Studies on the value that indigenous 
  people place on forest and wildlife resources indicate that they ascribe a high 
  value to their resources and understand that-in addition to being sources of 
  food, fuel, medicine, and building materials-these resources can also provide 
  ecosystem services (Ntiamoa-Baidu 1995, Olsen, Rodgers & Salehe 1999).</p>
<p>Increasing efforts are therefore being made to understand indigenous knowledge 
  systems and to promote their continued application, thereby mainstreaming such 
  knowledge and knowledge-holders and bringing them into new development projects. 
  This new form of partnership includes the application of indigenous knowledge 
  to environmental assessment and to project implementation (Croal 2000, Emery 
  2000).</p>
<p>The second result mentioned above-missing of commercial opportunities by communities-relates 
  to the right of control over traditional lands and resources, intellectual property, 
  and accommodation of customary laws and practices. Article 14 of the International 
  Labour Organization's Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (1989) 
  states that<i> 'the rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned 
  over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognized. In addition, 
  measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard the right of the peoples 
  concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have 
  traditionally had access for the subsistence and traditional activities. Particular 
  attention shall be paid to the situation of nomadic peoples and shifting cultivators 
  in this respect.'</i></p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity also recognizes the value of traditional 
  knowledge. Its Article 8(j) states that parties should, as far as possible, 
  '... <i>respect, preserve and maintain </i><i>knowledge, innovations and practices 
  of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant 
  for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote 
  their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of 
  such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing 
  of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge innovations and 
  practices.'</i></p>
<p>Many Governments are now in the process of implementing this principle through 
  their national biodiversity action plans, strategies and programmes. The means 
  employed include adoption of relevant legislation, policies, and administrative 
  arrangements for protecting traditional knowledge through prior informed consent. 
  Although such means are usually applied to medicinal plants, cultivars, and 
  some traditional practices, it has been pointed out that protection of traditional 
  knowledge should also include traditional stock raiser rights and the protection 
  of animal genetic resources (Kohler-Rollefson & McCorkle 2000). It has been 
  suggested that livestock projects should be required to present 'genetic impact 
  statements' to anticipate the effect on the local gene pool of the introduction 
  of exotic livestock breeds. If a negative impact is anticipated, the projects 
  could perhaps include a provision for maintaining a purebred population of the 
  indigenous livestock breed (Hall & Bradley 1995).</p>
<p>The World Bank's programme on Indigenous Knowledge in Africa has established 
  15 resource centres across Africa focussing on identification and dissemination 
  of indigenous or traditional knowledge and practices. Policies have also been 
  developed under this programme to protect indigenous knowledge, and to apply 
  it in agricultural, medicinal, and conservation practices.</p>
<p>Given the many and diverse pressures on Africa's biological resources, and 
  the enormous untapped potential for economic and social development, implementation 
  of strategies for effective conservation and sustainable use of these resources 
  is of paramount and immediate importance. Such strategies must be activated 
  on a number of fronts and existing measures at national, sub-regional and regional 
  levels will have to be reinforced, upgraded and opened up to further innovative 
  measures to deal with changes in the status of habitats or species. Compliance 
  with regional and international agreements must be strengthened through enforcement 
  of legislation, policies, and plans, and through institutional reform. Further 
  research and application of research findings is required to strengthen in-situ 
  and ex-situ conservation systems, particularly those involving local and indigenous 
  innovations and interventions. Systematic valuation of resources and incorporation 
  of those values into national accounting systems and development policies are 
  also required. Capacity building and awareness programmes are critical components 
  for each activity, and at each level (Mugabe 1998).</p>
