<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN NORTHERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Land quality and productivity are declining in cultivated areas, rangelands 
  and forests, as a result of a number of pressures. These include: rapid population 
  growth; climatic stresses and drought; overgrazing; clearing of forests and 
  woody vegetation; cultivation of marginal lands; unfavourable land tenure; irrational 
  agricultural production; and trade policies (El Bagouri 2000).</p>
<p>Forests and wooded areas are rapidly being degraded as wood is cut for fuel, 
  and to bring more land under cultivation. Not only does this result in reduced 
  natural habitat and natural resources available from forests, but loss of soil 
  cover and protection increases the risk of erosion by wind and rain, as well 
  as increasing the risk of flooding and landslides in these areas. In Egypt, 
  cultivation occupies a narrow strip along the Nile River (3.5 per cent of the 
  total land area of the country), surrounded by desert on either side. In these 
  desert margins, wind erosion is a threat, and may affect agriculture production 
  on the edges of cultivated areas. To slow down the effect of wind erosion, the 
  government of Egypt has a long-term plan to establish a protective belt of perennial 
  green vegetation cover (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>
<p>Rain-fed areas suffer particularly from prolonged and/or frequent dry spells 
  and droughts, and from inappropriate farming systems which, in turn, have been 
  encouraged by macroeconomic policies and pressures. In Sudan, for example, the 
  so-called 'suitcase farmers' have caused widespread loss of productivity, through 
  uncontrolled, low-input sorghum farming (Lusk 1987). High prices for this cereal 
  encouraged extensive monoculture, with inadequate fallow or rest periods for 
  the soil to recover, or alternative cropping to return nutrients removed from 
  the soil by sorghum. This has caused: serious losses of soil, through wind and 
  water erosion; loss of soil fertility; and loss of biodiversity, through degradation 
  of natural plant cover and deforestation. Fertility decline in Egypt is managed 
  by using mineral fertilizer-mainly nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers-at quite 
  high rates in comparison with other countries in Africa. The use of organic 
  matter and crop residues is not common in Egypt (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>
<p>Areas under irrigated cultivation are showing signs of chemical degradation, 
  such as: increased soil salinity; water-logging; and pollution. Irrigation in 
  areas with naturally high evaporation rates and inadequate drainage, for example, 
  leads to the accumulation of high levels of soluble salts in the topsoil. Salt-affected 
  or salinized soils have become widespread over the past 30 years, as a result 
  of the use of saline drainage water and brackish water in irrigation (Goossens, 
  Ghabour, Ongena and Gad 1994, FAO 1994, Framji 1974). In Egypt, 30-40 per cent 
  of the cultivated irrigated land is now salt-affected (mostly in the northern 
  part of the country, along the Nile delta), and this accounts for 15 per cent 
  of total production losses (FAO/AGL 2000). This region is now considered a global 
  'hot spot' of land salinization, together with the most fertile river basins 
  of Asia and Latin America (Scherr and Yadav 1996 in FAO 2000b).</p>
<p>Responses to curb salinization and the hydrological degradation of soils include: 
  improvements to leaching and drainage of irrigation water; land levelling (to 
  avoid collection of irrigation water in pools); applications of gypsum, organic 
  matter and farm manure; and the selection of salt-tolerant crops during the 
  reclamation programmes (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>

<p><a name="img2f2"></a>Rangelands are subject to: overstocking and overgrazing; 
  mismanagement of land, often associated with poorly defined or inappropriate 
  tenure policies; and the conversion of rangelands to cultivation. The environmental 
  impacts of land degradation include: reduced water quality from sedimentation 
  and pollution, thus leaving water unsuitable for human use or irrigation; impaired 
  navigation of watercourses; and increased costs for flood control and dam maintenance. 
  Ultimately, productivity is reduced, affecting food security in the long term 
  and the short term. According to the FAO (FAO/AGL 2000), only 5 per cent of 
  Egypt's cultivated lands are in excellent condition, 40 per cent are classified 
  as good, and the remaining 55 per cent are classified as either medium or poor. 
  Furthermore, the FAO estimates that soil degradation in Egypt results in an 
  overall production loss of 53 per cent (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>
<p>According to Reich and others (2001), the areas most vulnerable to desertification 
  are along the desert margins and, within these areas, where population densities 
  are high, and where land management practices are insensitive to climatic or 
  physical restraints. Thus, large areas of northern Africa are highly vulnerable 
  to desertification, along the borders of the Sahara desert and the arid Sahelian 
  region. In Algeria, for example, 85 per cent of the land area is desert and, 
  of the remaining 15 per cent, 14 per cent is moderately, highly or very highly 
  vulnerable to desertification (Reich and others 2001). In Morocco, 52 per cent 
  of the land area is vulnerable to desertification, and 45 per cent is either 
  moderately, highly or very highly vulnerable (Reich and others 2001).</p>
<h4>Improving land quality and productivity in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>The consequences of declining productivity could include: reduction in return 
  from capital investment and labour inputs; lower incomes, especially for small-scale 
  farmers; and increasing rural-urban migration, in search of more secure livelihoods. 
  Therefore, combating degradation is of paramount importance for sustainable 
  development. Northern African countries are carrying out varied activities in 
  order to assess and to monitor degradation, and to test techniques to mitigate 
  desertification.</p>
<p>All the countries of the northern African sub-region have ratified the UNCCD. 
  Tunisia has produced a National Action Plan, Morocco has established a website 
  for information dissemination, and most countries have produced national reports. 
  In 2000, the Union du Maghreb Arabe (AMU) produced a subregional action plan 
  for the Arab countries of northern Africa (UNCCD 2001). Greater efforts are 
  also being exerted to reduce the rate of population increase, especially in 
  Tunisia and Egypt. In Morocco, a decentralization process is underway, in order 
  to encourage rural development and to improve food and economic security in 
  rural areas and in agricultural lifestyles. Participatory implementation tools 
  have been piloted, alongside a new legal framework for the development of rain-fed 
  agriculture. In Sudan, the government passed a decentralization law in 1998, 
  transferring responsibility for revenue generation and expenditure to local 
  authorities.</p>
