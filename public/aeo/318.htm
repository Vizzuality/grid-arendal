<p>The Fortress World scenario has the potential to destroy the environment and, 
  possibly, the whole of humankind (see <a href="317.htm#fig413">Figure 4.13</a>). 
  Since there will be no coordinated efforts to ensure environmental sustainability, 
  the situation regarding most resources is one of overexploitation, either to 
  meet the needs of the élite or to ensure the basic survival of the poor. Environmental 
  conditions, therefore, deteriorate, as pollution, climate change, land change 
  and ecosystem degradation interact to amplify the crisis. Environmental degradation, 
  food insecurity and emergent diseases foster a vast health crisis, as both free 
  market values and reformist tendencies become incapable of handling environmental 
  externalities. The affluent minority, alarmed by rampant migration, terrorism 
  and disease, reacts with sufficient cohesion and strength to impose an authoritarian 
  Fortress World, where they flourish in protected enclaves. The fortresses are 
  bubbles of privilege amidst oceans of misery.</p>
<p>The Great Transitions scenario, on the other hand, may arise from two totally 
  unrelated considerations. Given that a Fortress World scenario is destructive 
  to the environment and to humanity, it could be a harbinger of the urgent need 
  for all humankind, including Africans, to seek alternative ways of managing 
  the environment. Depending on the level of destruction that people's activities 
  would have wrought on the environment by the time this need arises, a Great 
  Transitions scenario may or may not be sustainable (see <a href="317.htm#fig413">Figure 
  4.13</a>).</p>

              been informed by a broad spectrum of approaches.One can conclude 
              that the problems of development are larger than the highly heterogeneous 
              policies, plans and programmes undertaken by the full spectrum of 
              economic approaches. It is increasingly evident that our understanding 
              of the reasons why onefifth of humanity enjoys unprecedented wealth 
              while the other four-fifths live in various states of poverty and 
              privation is incomplete. Clearly, conventional analyses of socio-economic, 
              cultural, ecological and political phenomena are limited in their 
              ability to elucidate the multiple problems we now encounter globally.</i></p>

              least the concepts we use to define it, are deficient.We can speak

              trenchant poverty, environmental degradation and socio-political 
              unrest. Related to this problematic is existential malaise, particularly 
              in those societies considered the most "developed".This global problematic 
              is not transient. It speaks to profound issues about who we are 
              that have become repressed in our individual and social consciousness.'</i></p>

<p><a name="box43"></a>On the other hand, the seeds of change are already being 
  germinated all over Africa, and governments and NGOs are already aware of the 
  need to evolve a new course and a new perspective on environmental and development 
  issues. The intellectual community, too, as shown in various aspects of the 
  description of the Great Transition scenario, are already clamouring for a new 
  dictum on development. The honest ones among the developed countries already 
  accept the fact that they have misled the developing world for too long (Gotlieb 
  1996). Africa's democratically elected leaders have also become more responsible 
  and humane, and are anxious to subscribe to the issue of environmental sustainability. 
  They, however, need to be convinced of the inability of the Market Forces scenario 
  and the Policy Reform scenario to lead Africa to the promised land (see <a href="#box43">Box 
  4.3</a>). Everybody detests the idea of a Fortress World scenario evolving and 
  playing itself out in Africa.</p>
<p>Given the current trend in Africa and all over the world, it may be surmised 
  that a Market Forces scenario may only be plausible within a short time-say, 
  ten years-at about which point probabilities are high that a number of branching 
  points will start to emerge. Possible branching points may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing social pressures for government reform, and more concerted attention 
    to environmental and social issues. It is this that may lead to a full blown 
    Policy Reform scenario.</li>
  <li>Increasing concentration of wealth and power. When posited with existing 
    levels of corruption, there will be a breakdown in civil society and a rise 
    in political anarchy. It is this that may lead to lead to the Fortress World 
    scenario.</li>
  <li>Of course, widespread rejection of the 'IMF Dream', coupled with the development 
    and adoption of new technologies, approaches and visions. This is what may 
    lead to the Great Transition Scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, the point being made is that the environment is so valuable and 
  the inhabitants so precious that the future need not be left to chance or to 
  some curious form of evolution. The scenarios described in this report have 
  shown the unacceptability of a business-as-usual approach to environmental issues. 
  It has also shown the inadequacy of an acceptance of a Policy Reform scenario. 
  Something that has not worked in the past is not likely to work now or in the 
  future unless the constraints that made it non-functional in the first instance 
  are removed. Certain forces that militate against the removal of these constraints 
  dominate the world political and economic system.</p>
<p>Africa has been very vulnerable to many events happening all over the world 
  or within the region itself. For instance, the consequences of environmental 
  disasters, such as floods and drought, continue to haunt the inhabitants of 
  many countries, and remain one of the great challenges to governments. Of course, 
  the problem of hunger is mostly felt in Africa, where more than 75 per cent 
  of the population live below the poverty line. Many of these aspects of vulnerability 
  have been discussed and described in <a href="261.htm">Chapter 4</a>, and need 
  not be repeated here. But the lesson is that, unless concrete steps are taken 
  in the way we use the environment, the sufferings and problems of the 20th century 
  will be child's play compared to what lies in store. Wherein, then, lies our 
  future in Africa?</p>
<p>For some time, the Great Transitions scenario may remain an enigma to both 
  policy and practice. Yet therein lies the hope for Africa and the African environment. 
  It will remain an enigma for many reasons. First, it is going to be difficult 
  to convince the peoples of Africa that the future of humankind lies in the Great 
  Transitions scenario. Secondly, African countries are not all at the same level 
  of awareness and socioeconomic development, so the idea of a Great Transitions 
  scenario could still look like a dream to some. Furthermore, the expectations 
  in the Great Transitions are things that take time to mature. Take, for instance, 
  the issue of good governance, which democracy represents, and its almost universal 
  acceptance as the best form of government to promote development. In recent 
  times and in many countries, including some Indian Ocean Islands, there have 
  been reports of military takeover of governments. It is, therefore, possible 
  to expect that, even when there could be a belief in the principles of the Great 
  Transitions scenario, the playing field in Africa is far from level. There is 
  a need to emphasize the need for this awareness. Wherein lies the future of 
  Africa?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question meaningfully, we like to draw on the relationship 
  between the Policy Reform scenario and the Great Transitions scenario. Both 
  scenarios are forms of 'backcasting' (see <a href="264.htm#fig44">Figure 4.4</a>), 
  whereby desirable futures, and device mechanisms for manipulating the system 
  to meet targets, are defined. The future of the African environment lies in 
  the ability of governments and ministers of the environment to appreciate that 
  current policies and practices remain grossly inadequate when it comes to meeting 
  the demands of a sustainable environment. There are many MEAs currently in operation. 
  These agreements and protocols were designed to assist Africans to cultivate 
  some respect for the environment. We have shown that current rates of population 
  growth, and the demand on resources, render these efforts inadequate. Of course, 
  many of them are a distant cry from what is required to move towards a Great 
  Transitions pattern of environmental sustainability. As a first step, governments 
  should review these MEAs, and create mechanisms in order to ensure their compliance 
  by differ-ent countries in the region. Governments should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>devise systems for identifying requirements for a sustainable environment;</li>
  <li>set new targets based on the requirements of a Great Transitions pattern 
    of environmental growth (see narratives);</li>
  <li>design mechanisms to steer national, sub-regional and regional poli-cies 
    towards meeting these new targets (this could imply the institution of new 
    memorandums of understanding, based on the new environmental standards); and</li>
  <li>encourage governments in different countries to manage their environments 
    conscientiously, in line with these new standards and targets.</li>
</ul>
