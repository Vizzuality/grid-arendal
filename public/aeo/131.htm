<p><a name="img2d1"></a>The Northern African sub-region has an arid climate and 
  desert or semi-desert environments are dominant. Forests and woodlands are therefore 
  not common in most of the six countries of the sub-region except along the coast 
  of the western Mediterranean countries, the Atlas Mountains, and in the tropical 
  zone which cuts through parts of Sudan. There are also some mangroves along 
  the coast of the Red Sea. The total forest/woodland area in Northern Africa 
  is estimated as 68 million hectares and constitutes 8 per cent of the total 
  land area and about 10 per cent of Africa's forests (FAO 2001a). Although some 
  countries have actually shown increases in forest cover in the past 30 years 
  (owing to establishment of plantation forestry), the major concern in the region 
  is still loss and degradation of natural forests and wooded areas.</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUE OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS IN NORTHERN 
  AFRICA</h3>
<p>Non-forest types of woody vegetation in Northern Africa include forest-like 
  stands of trees, shrubs, and large bushes found in sandy wadis (wetlands) and 
  depressions. The summits of coastal and inland high mountains support many wooded 
  plants. Hydrophilous reeds occur in wetlands, and trees are cultivated as windbreaks 
  or hedgerows around farms, along roads and canals constituting additional forest-like 
  resources in the region. All wooded areas, although not counted in the forest 
  area figures, are important for forest products, grazing and control of desertification 
  through soil stabilization and regulation of hydrological systems (AOAD 1998, 
  Hegazy 1999). No significant commercial timber production is practised or planned 
  in the subregion, although small plantations do exist. Local people use over 
  two-thirds of forest plants for food, medicinal purposes, construction, energy, 
  and livestock rearing, and 35 per cent of plants are known to be multipurpose, 
  that is to say useful for more than one application (FAO 1999, UNESCO/UCO 1998). 
  In most countries in the sub- region, forestry's contribution to GDP is low. 
  Sudan is the only country in the sub-region in which the forestry sector contributes 
  significantly to GDP-as much as 13 per cent. Production of industrial wood is 
  very limited with about two-thirds of the demand for industrial rounded wood 
  and processed wood products in the sub-region being met by imports (FAO 1999).</p>
