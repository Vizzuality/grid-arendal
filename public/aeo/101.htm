<p>Most lowland coastal areas in Northern Africa, especially deltas and islands, 
  are subjected to slow tectonic subsidence that will accentuate the effects of 
  the rise in sea level predicted as a result of climate change. For example, 
  lowlands in Libya stretch along the Gulf of Sirte where there is an important 
  oil shipment facility and, in Tunisia, lowlands are of great economic value 
  for agriculture, urbanization, harbours, industry, and tourism. These would 
  all experience accelerated coastal erosion and inundation of land. It is, however, 
  the deltaic plain of the Nile River, the most important coastal lowland of the 
  Mediterranean shoreline, that is expected to suffer the greatest losses. A one-metre 
  rise in sea level would inundate 2 000 km<sup>2</sup> of land in the lower Nile 
  Delta area and render 1 000 km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural land unusable. The 
  costs of this are estimated at US$750 million (Khafagy, Hulsbergen & Baarse 
  1992). If erosion is taken into account, an additional 100 km<sup>2</sup> of 
  land would be lost, at a cost of US$60 million (Khafagy and others 1992).</p>
<p>The Egyptian city of Alexandria would be severely affected, losing most of 
  its infrastructure, the country's most popular beaches and cultural and scenic 
  monuments. There would be associated losses of revenues from tourism and of 
  industrial, residential and agricultural land. Alexandria's population currently 
  stands at three million and is predicted to grow to eight million by 2030, by 
  which time half the residents would be at risk from inundation and displacement. 
  However, public awareness and concern is low, with fewer than 20 per cent of 
  residents prepared to move away, and the majority of the population regarding 
  it as the government's responsibility to provide protection. In addition to 
  inundation of land, sea level rise would also increase coastal erosion, flooding 
  and saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers. The coastal zone is likely 
  to suffer increased impacts from wave action and storm surges due to sea level 
  rise. The average rate of coastal erosion in Alexandria is currently only 20 
  cm/yr, but three beaches have disappeared since the beginning of this century 
  and eight of the other twelve are showing signs of erosion (El Raey and others 
  1995, in IPCC 1998). </p>
<h4>Mitigating the effects of climate change on Northern Africa's coastal zone</h4>
<p>A three-pronged approach is required to mitigation of sea level rise and other 
  effects of climate change on Northern Africa's coast, including research and 
  monitoring of potential impacts, development of appropriate responses to those 
  impacts, and the integration of response strategies into planning and development, 
  policies and programmes. Furthermore, this approach should take account of the 
  ongoing coastal erosion and pollution as well as of the activities responsible 
  for these, both in the coastal zone itself and in the hinterland. An integrated 
  approach is therefore required, with a focus on long-term issues appropriate 
  to managing the impacts of sea-level rise and climate change. It is therefore 
  recommended that Northern African countries continue with and strengthen assessments 
  of vulnerability of coastal areas to the consequences of climate change, as 
  well as formulating and implementing adaptation options within integrated coastal 
  management strategies (Nicholls & de la Vega- Leinert 2000).</p>
