<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Southern Africa has a range of forest and woodland types that follow the rainfall 
  distribution of the sub-region. The wetter, more northern parts of the sub-region 
  support more closed canopy forest, whilst drier countries in the south have 
  predominantly woodlands and savannas. The total forest and woodland area of 
  Southern Africa amounts to 32.7 per cent of the sub-region's total area, and 
  constitutes 34 per cent of all of Africa's forests (FAO 2001a). Angola has the 
  highest forest cover with 56 per cent of the land area under forests; Lesotho 
  has the lowest with less than 1 per cent (FAO 2001a). There are four forest 
  and woodland types, namely deciduous broadleaf forests (temperate forest types), 
  lower montane forest, mangroves, deciduous/semi-deciduous broadleaf forest, 
  and savannas (tropical forest types). Southern Africa also has six regions of 
  exceptional plant species diversity, and forest species are abundant in many 
  of these (White 1983).</p>
<p>The major issues of concern in the forests of Southern Africa are degradation 
  of forests and woodlands, and overexploitation of certain species, resulting 
  in loss of ecosystem goods and services.</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUES OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS IN SOUTHERN 
  AFRICA</h3>
<p>Forest products are a valuable source of export earnings and revenue throughout 
  the sub-region, and the communities living in forest or woodland areas are highly 
  dependent on forest products for meeting everyday food and energy needs. For 
  example, in 1998, South Africa's exports of forest products totalled US$837 
  million, mainly from wood pulp and paper most of which was produced in plantation 
  forests. Zimbabwe's exports were US$42 million, mainly from sawnwood (FAO 2001a). 
  Forests and woodlands are important to local communities, mainly as a source 
  of domestic fuel, either wood or charcoal. For example, about 80 per cent of 
  Mozambique's population live in rural areas and depend on wood for cooking and 
  for heating of water for domestic use, space heating and drying of foodstuffs. 
  The charcoal industry generates about US$30 million annually, and is the sole 
  source of income for about 60 000 people (Kalumiana 1998). Important non-wood 
  forest products include honey, beeswax, bamboo, reeds, mushrooms, caterpillars, 
  fodder, wild edible plants and fruits, leaves and bark for weaving, and resins. 
  The medicinal plant trade is extensive and profitable in Southern Africa with 
  approximately 3 000 species (10 per cent) of Southern African plants used medicinally 
  and around 350 species commonly and widely used (van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn & Gericke 
  1997). Other species harvested from the wild contribute as much as 40 per cent 
  to household incomes (Cavendish 1999) or between US$200-1000 per year (Shackleton, 
  Shackleton & Cousins 2000).</p>
