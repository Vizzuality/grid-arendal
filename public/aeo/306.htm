  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, proliferation of slums is rampant, as more 
  people are displaced from prime agricultural land by landlords and forced to 
  move into the cities to look for other opportunities. The infrastructure in 
  the low-income, urban areas deteriorates rapidly as the city authorities become 
  unable to cope with the rate of influx of people. While, in 2002, only 3 per 
  cent of Addis Ababa is planned, and 28 per cent and 40 per cent of Kampala and 
  Nairobi respectively, these percentages decline as the planning fails to keep 
  pace with the rate of development and expansion.</p>
<p>Crime rates increase, especially in the informal settlements, and this spills 
  over to the high-class residential areas, forcing those living in these areas 
  to increase expenditure on security measures, such as high walls, electric fences 
  and armed security guards. As the situation persists, middle-class and high-class 
  residents move out of the cities, and create their own secure settlements in 
  peri-urban areas, such as Mukono in Kampala, Ngong in Nairobi and Debra Berhane 
  in Addis Ababa.</p>

<p>There are large differences between the environments in the élite fortresses 
  and in poor areas. The élites being much fewer in numbers, richer and better 
  educated, the environments of the fortresses are well protected. Basic services 
  are not only available, but also very much more reliable than they are in the 
  poor areas. The environment is still rich, and is sustained by measures for 
  environmental protection. Careful planning of the fortresses ensures that air 
  quality remains high, because of low population densities and sufficient green 
  areas. No significant industrial waste is produced inside the fortresses, because 
  industries are concentrated outside the fortresses, where the poor labourers 
  live. Nevertheless, sewage water is not treated before disposal, because it 
  is disposed of in the areas of the poor. The picture in poor areas is totally 
  different, with air pollution, unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation and solid 
  waste accumulation being the main elements.</p>

  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>The concentration of populations in well-resourced areas implies that, in the 
  Fortress World sceanrio, the Southern African countries continue to witness 
  phenomenal urban growth, with inadequate provision of basic services, such as 
  water and sanitation. Informal peri-urban settlements proliferate, resulting 
  in disease, destitution and moral decay, which further worsens the spread of 
  HIV/AIDS. The areas with high population concentrations witness further land 
  degradation, water pollution, habitat destruction and deforestation.</p>

<p>There is nowhere more expressive than this sub-region of the dichotomy between 
  the élites in the fortresses and the poor in the shanties. Well laid-out and 
  yearround green areas in urban centres are occupied by the rich and powerful. 
  There are first-class, efficient rubbish disposal systems, proper sanitation, 
  effective sewage systems, and good roads and waterways. The poor work to maintain 
  the comforts of the élite. At the end of the day, the workers return to a totally 
  different life-one of filth, unsafe water, non-existent rubbish disposal systems, 
  poor sanitation and non-functioning sewage systems.</p>

<p>In the Fortress World scenario, urban areas expand as populations flee from 
  the devastated countryside, making existing settlements unsustainable, deprived 
  of adequate water, sanitation, power and services. Many are scenes of continual 
  pillage, violent crime and misery. A few have been converted to religious retreats 
  by fundamentalist groups of all persuasions, prepared to fight to death for 
  the preservation of their rights.</p>
