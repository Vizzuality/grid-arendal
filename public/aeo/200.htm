<p><a name="img2f9"></a>Countries of western Africa, as in other sub-regions, 
  are bound by a complex interaction of land tenure policies, which often create 
  insecurity of tenure and exploitation of production in the short-term, and which 
  lay the foundations for conflict over resources (Toulmin and Longbottom 1997). 
  Under customary law, chiefs are the dominant land owners, through whom members 
  of the community obtain access to resources via ownership, sharecropping, tenancy 
  and pledging. The countries inherited tenure laws from the colonial government 
  and, at independence, state-ownership became the norm, and land was then either 
  sold or leased privately. Thus, customary land tenure practices have been weakened, 
  and are no longer recognized by the state or rural communities (DFID 1999). 
  Attempts to reconcile differences in land tenure policies, and the influence 
  of Islamic laws and development ideals have, in many cases, created greater 
  confusion and conflicts between land users (Toulmin and Longbottom 1997).</p>
<p>Conflicts over land and resource access rights have most frequently been between 
  farmers and herders, migrant farmers and governments. An example is the establishment 
  of cultivation in areas used by seasonal herders, such as the northern savanna 
  areas and seasonal floodplains (Toulmin and Longbottom 1997, Maltby 1986). The 
  impacts of inappropriate land tenure are economic, environmental and social 
  (Ouedraogo and Toulmin 1999). Economic impacts are loss of livelihoods and increasing 
  poverty, as well as unrealized potential of commercial agriculture. Environmental 
  impacts include disincentives for investment in land care or land improvement, 
  and social consequences include deterioration of community cohesion and rising 
  levels of conflict.</p>
<p>Many western African countries are undergoing land policy reform, either in 
  the preparatory discussion phase, or in the pilot phase, testing different legislative 
  approaches. The main objectives of these reforms are: clarification of rights 
  and access; harmonization of existing legislation; creation of incentives for 
  enhanced land management; raising productivity and economic development; improving 
  dialogue between stakeholders; and diffusing potential conflicts (Ouedraogo 
  and Toulmin 1999). The main type of reform has been to convert greater areas 
  of land to private ownership, particularly in favour of large-scale agricultural 
  developers (Ouedraogo and Toulmin 1999). Côte d'Ivoire's Rural Land Plan, which 
  was implemented in 1988, is a programme of mapping and recording the boundaries 
  of landholdings and existing rights of individuals and groups. This is done 
  through consultation with local inhabitants and validation by village committees, 
  thereby integrating customary laws into a new rural land tenure code (DFID 1999).</p>
