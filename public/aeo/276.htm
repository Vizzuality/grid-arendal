  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, the countries of this subregion continue to 
  pollute less, but they suffer from the effects of pollution from the north. 
  The effects of climatic variation become more pronounced, especially in the 
  Sahelian areas and in urban centres. The desert continues to encroach.</p>
<p>Initiatives linked to ozone layer protection and to the reduction of greenhouse 
  effect gas emissions increase at an international level. Monitoring systems 
  of pollution impacts are established, but their results remain mitigated due 
  to non-compliance by some countries in the sub-region.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>Initially, air quality deteriorates as urban centres expand and as more people, 
  with increased incomes, are able to afford cars. However, measures (standards) 
  are put in place to curb vehicular emissions. Increased tax on fossil fuels 
  forces industries to revert to other alternatives, such as electricity or gas, 
  which have lesser emissions. Climate variability, however, remains an issue, 
  but its impact is reduced because the sector which is most directly impacted 
  by climate variability (that is, agriculture) is adequately funded to offset 
  the impacts through irrigation.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>As the large cities grow larger, air pollution increases. Vehicles and industry 
  remain the main sources of air pollution and emission of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, 
  as the problem reaches alarming levels, especially in urban and industrialized 
  areas, the major air polluting industries-such as transportation, air conditioning 
  and cement-take appropriate measures to reduce their environmental impacts. 
  Vehicles, especially those used for mass transport, shift to using natural gas 
  instead of fossil fuels. The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting 
  products in the air-conditioning industry is reduced.</p>
