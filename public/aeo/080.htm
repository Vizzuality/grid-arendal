<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA </h2>
<p>Southern Africa has rich biological resources in a variety of ecosystems which 
  range from moist tropical forests in Angola and Zambia to savannas, coastal 
  forests and mangroves, deserts and semi-deserts, and to the extraordinary diversity 
  of plants of the Cape Floral Region, in South Africa. The sub-region boasts 
  an average of 57 mammalian species and 136 breeding bird species per 10 000 
  km<sup>2</sup> (UNDP and others 2000). South Africa ranks as the third most 
  biologically diverse country in the world, mainly because of the richness of 
  its plant life-over 18 000 species of vascular plants of which over 80 per cent 
  are endemic. In terms of numbers of endemic species of mammals, birds, reptiles 
  and amphibians, South Africa is the fifth richest country in Africa and the 
  twenty-fourth richest in the world (DEA&T 1997).</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUES OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN SOUTHERN 
  AFRICA</h3>
<p>Southern Africa's rich biological resources play an important role in ensuring 
  long-term food security. Access to genetic resources for crop and animal breeding 
  purposes is also seen as a critical factor. Many species of plants and animals 
  have medicinal properties and most of these are used in traditional healing, 
  some are being investigated for commercial production. Approximately 10 per 
  cent of Southern African plants (roughly 3 000 species) are used medicinally, 
  and 10 per cent of these (about 350 species) are commonly and widely used (van 
  Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn & Gericke 1997). They include Warburgia salutaris, a plant 
  of which the root and bark are used to treat coughs, headaches and stomach problems, 
  and which is fast disappearing in Southern Africa (Cunningham 1993). The locally 
  known 'African Potato' (Hypoxis sp) is being researched for the extraction of 
  hypoxicide, a sterol (plant acid) used traditionally to treat dizziness and 
  bladder disorders and which has now been shown to inhibit the growth of tumour 
  cells and also to have antiinflammatory properties (Drewes, Hall, Learmonth 
  & Upfold 1984).</p>

<p><a name="img2b11"></a>As in other sub-regions of Africa, natural habitats in 
  Southern Africa are coming under increasing pressure from expansion of agriculture 
  and plantation forestry, human settlements, mining activities, and other commercial 
  or subsistence activities, both inside and outside of protected areas. Individual 
  species are threatened through habitat loss, selective harvesting, poaching, 
  and through the spread of alien invasive organisms.</p>
<p>One of the greatest pressures on wild species is the trade in plant and animal 
  products, such as ivory, horn, and skins. Over the past 30 years, trade restrictions, 
  mainly through CITES, have been used at the global level as a tool to control 
  trade and thus help conserve populations in the wild. Implementation of regulations 
  has had varied levels of success in Southern Africa. For example, the listing 
  of the Black Rhino in Appendix 1 (species threatened with extinction) of CITES 
  during the 1970s has not helped revive the rhino population which is still too 
  low for breeding and multiplication in the wild. Trade controls have resulted 
  in higher prices being paid on the black market for rhino horn, which in turn 
  encourages poaching of wild populations. As already mentioned, restrictions 
  on the trade in ivory, and sound conservation practices have seen significant 
  growth in national herds of elephant in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and these countries 
  are now pushing for limited trade in ivory to provide economic incentives for 
  continued conservation.</p>
<p>Sub-regional cooperation plays a significant role in the conservation of biological 
  resources in Southern Africa, and the Southern African Convention for Wildlife 
  Management has been successful in regional monitoring, assessment and management 
  of wildlife resources. However, such conservation measures need continued resourcing 
  and support, so that benefits continue to be derived from conservation of species 
  in the wild.</p>
