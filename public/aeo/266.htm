<h2>THE DRIVING FORCES OF THE SCENARIOS</h2>
<p>Driving forces are the mechanisms that allow change to occur. They can be thought 
  of as clusters of shifts within society so great that they cause other significant 
  shifts to take place. Driving forces set the initial course for development, 
  but the complex regional system can rapidly change direction at critical thresholds 
  of extreme turbulence and instability. Understanding the nature and interplay 
  of driving forces is essential to developing scenarios. Driving forces are the 
  departure points for looking at the future. They may operate with different 
  magnitudes and directions than those of the initial stage, and they may emerge 
  or disappear as circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>Current trends, on the other hand, are reflected in The State of the African 
  Environment. Although they are not inevitably persistent, but evolve over time, 
  they certainly condition the initial direction of economic, social and environmental 
  change, and they may strongly influence even the long-term future. The driving 
  forces control trends which are themselves influenced by social, economic and 
  environmental conditions (Gallopin and others, 1997).</p>
<h3>THE DRIVING FORCES</h3>
<h4>Demographics</h4>
<p>Africa witnessed dramatic population increase, from 221 million in 1950 to 
  785 million in 2000 (see <a href="#fig411">Figure 4.11</a>). Despite the fact 
  that population growth rates have declined since the mid-1980s, Africa remains 
  the world's fastest growing region, at an estimated 2.4 per cent per annum. 
  However, future growth rates are expected to be lower. The region will attain 
  an estimated population of 1 406 million by the year 2030 (UNDP 1999, 2000) 
  (see also <a href="#fig411">Figure 4.11</a>). Rapid urbanization is also a main 
  driving force, which is causing stresses in many African economies. With an 
  average annual growth rate of 3.71 per cent (see <a href="#fig412">Figure 4.12</a>), 
  Africa is the fastest urbanizing region of the world. Nevertheless, Africa is 
  still very largely rural and agricultural. In 2000, the urbanization level was 
  only 37.9 per cent, and it is projected to reach 54.5 per cent by 2030. Urban 
  population is expected to grow from 297 million in 2000 to 766 million in 2030 
  (UNDP 1999).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the problem of population in Africa is not related only to the 
  population size, because Africa remains underpopulated by world standards. Rapid 
  population growth entails challenges for the African countries to improve standards 
  of living and to provide essential social services, including housing, transport, 
  sanitation, health, education, job opportunities and security. It also limits 
  the capacity of African countries to deal with the problem of poverty. Furthermore, 
  rapid population growth rates are leading to political and social conflicts 
  among different ethnic, religious and social groups.</p>
<p>The population age structure is heavily skewed towards young people, which 
  generates tremendous demographic momentum. About 43 per cent of the population 
  is below the age of 15 years, about 52 per cent is between the ages of 15 and 
  60 years, and 5 per cent are aged 60 years or older (UNDP 2000). The 15-24 age 
  group numbered 149 million in 1998, constituting about 20 per cent of the total 
  African population. This workforce bulge can be the basis for more investment, 
  greater labour productivity and rapid economic development (Makinwa-Adebusoye, 
  2001). With such high population momentum, reflected in the rather high fertility 
  rates, and in improving health and medical situations, it can only be expected 
  that the population of African countries will rise to phenomenal heights and 
  will continue to impact the environment in significant ways. Left unattended, 
  these trends lead to great strains and undesirable consequences on the environment.</p>
<p>However, the rate of population increase is not uniform. Some areas experience 
  higher than average rates of population increase, due both to higher intrinsic 
  rates of growth and to immigration from other areas within a country, sub-region 
  or the whole region. Such areas include town and cities, coastal regions, and 
  the vicinity of lakes and rivers. Of these, the impact of population growth 
  in urban areas is particularly important, because of the changes in lifestyle, 
  consumption patterns and waste production that accompany urbanization. Conversely, 
  some areas experience lower than average rates of population growth, due to 
  below-average intrinsic rates of population increase and to emigration. Such 
  areas include those in which there are conflicts or where there is severe environmental 
  degradation.</p>
