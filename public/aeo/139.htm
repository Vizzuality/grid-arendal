<h3>FOREST COVER AND QUALITY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Southern Africa has one of the fastest growing populations in the world and 
  faces the challenge of trying to increase food supplies by some 3 per cent per 
  year. To date, this challenge has been addressed by improvements in agricultural 
  production, and by bringing large areas of wooded land under cultivation. The 
  sub-region is therefore witnessing an increasingly high rate of deforestation, 
  mainly due to human activities. Rates of deforestation over the last 10 years 
  have ranged from 2.4 per cent per year in Malawi to 0.1 per cent per year in 
  South Africa, whilst Swaziland has experienced a 1.2 per cent per year net increase 
  in the its forest area (FAO 2001a). The other main pressure leading to deforestation 
  in the sub-region is fuelwood harvesting and tree cutting for charcoal (Chenje 
  2000). Studies show that both rural and urban demands for wood energy have increased, 
  and it is expected that these demands will almost double over the next 30 years 
  due to growing populations and economic conditions (FAO 2001b). For example, 
  worsening poverty in some urban areas is forcing many people to turn to charcoal 
  and fuelwood to meet their domestic energy requirements because these are cheap 
  and fuelwood can be collected rather than purchased (World Bank 1996). In some 
  countries, particularly those in which charcoal use is prevalent (Angola, Mozambique, 
  Tanzania and Zambia), trading in charcoal is a major source of income for some 
  households, contributing to the rate of wood collection and deforestation. In 
  Zambia, for example, more than half the country's fuelwood is converted to charcoal, 
  requiring the clearance of some 430 km<sup>2</sup> of woodland every year to 
  produce more than 100 000 tonnes of charcoal (Chenje 2000). Commercial logging 
  is a further cause of deforestation, and, in some cases, refugees from the wars 
  in Angola and Mozambique have resettled in wooded areas, contributing to tree-clearance.</p>

<p><a name="img2d5"></a>Selective harvesting of forest species is intensifying 
  pressures on forest and woodland resources, and has the potential to degrade 
  habitats, reduce biodiversity, and impair ecosystem functions such as water 
  and soil quality regulation, even though clear felling does not occur. Commercial 
  exploitation of medicinal plants from forests and woodland is an increasingly 
  important component of selective deforestation, resulting in the localized disappearance 
  of certain plant species. Commercialization of particular crafts, such as basket 
  making, is also causing the disappearance of certain plant species. Another 
  issue of concern is that species introduced for plantation forestry production 
  are rapidly invading grassland ecosystems where they use vast amounts of water, 
  disturb ecosystem functioning, and reduce biodiversity. Selective harvesting 
  results in changes to the biodiversity and relative abundance of different species, 
  as well as changing the microclimate, global climate, nutrient cycles and hydrological 
  regimes.</p>
Reduced forest cover and reduced forest quality accelerate soil erosion, sedimentation 
and siltation as well as siltation-induced flooding at points far away from the 
deforested areas. Soil erosion is probably the most important factor in the decline 
in agricultural productivity. This impacts most severely on rural communities 
that are most dependent on small-scale agriculture and natural resources for their 
livelihoods. 
<p>Other impacts of forest and woodland loss or degradation include loss of resources 
  for future exploitation, either local or commercial, for agriculture, pharmaceuticals, 
  or crafts. It is estimated that 300 000 to 400 000 hectares of natural grassland 
  forests and plant species of medicinal value are destroyed in Tanzania each 
  year. Tanzania has one of the largest ruminant livestock populations in Africa, 
  many of them owned by pastoralists, and it is clear that the seriousness of 
  this loss for the health and welfare of livestock (and therefore for that of 
  their owners) will escalate in the near future (Ole Lengisugi and Mziray 1996).</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable management and conservation of forests and woodlands in 
  Southern Africa</h4>
<p>Most forests in Southern Africa are either state-owned or privatized with ownership 
  by local communities being only weakly supported by laws (Alden Wily 2000). 
  The failure to involve local people and have tangible benefits accrue to them 
  has disassociated people from forests and even made them co-exploiters and co-destroyers 
  of their own forests. With growing democratic governance and rapid spread of 
  environmental awareness, community participation in forest management and land 
  tenure reform is being promoted and is gaining popularity as a sustainable means 
  of natural resource management and income generation. In Tanzania, for example, 
  a 'Land Act' clearly states that forest reserves may be owned by the state, 
  private companies, or communities and legislation in South Africa also makes 
  provision for community ownership of reserved forests. Local community actions 
  have been encouraged in Malawi (see <a href="#box2d6">Box 2d.6</a>) and recent 
  legislation enacted in the country recognizes traditional ownership rights in 
  the form of Village Forest Areas. Joint Management Committees in Zambia, Local 
  Resource Management Councils on Mozambique, and Management Authorities in Namibia, 
  have also been established to coordinate allocation of access rights and/or 
  distribute benefits among the local population (Alden Wiley, 2000).</p>

            <p>In Malawi a recent project has successfully trained members of 
              local communities in agro-forestry and extension work.Member of 
              local communities working as extension officers for the Department 
              of Forestry have until recently been excluded from most training 
              programmes, and are thus not performing their duties optimally or 
              achieving recognition. A local development organisation has worked 
              with these people, training them in forestry and agro-forestry practices, 
              the Forestry Policy Act, participatory rural appraisal tools, extension 
              techniques, and community motivation. This has boosted both their 
              morale and performance, and has improved communication among a wide 
              range of stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Southern African countries of Angola and Tanzania are members of the ATO, 
  and each has participated in developing criteria and indicators for sustainable 
  forest management (FAO 2001a). Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have some 
  forest area certified by the FSC, and all countries of the sub-region have some 
  of their forests in protected areas. Efforts to promote sustained regional self-sufficiency 
  in forest and wood products, and to enhance the economic and environmental performance 
  of the forestry sector are being pursued through the SADC Forestry Sector. The 
  Forestry Sector coordinates programmes in forestry education and training, improved 
  forest resource management, forest resources assessment and monitoring, forest 
  research, utilization of forest products, marketing, and environmental protection. 
  The Sector also developed the Forestry Policy and Development Strategy, approved 
  in September 1997. The Strategy identifies priorities for cooperation in building 
  capacity in sustainable management, protection and conservation of forest resources, 
  facilitating of trade in forest products, promoting sustained regional self-sufficiency 
  in forest and wood products, improving public awareness of forestry, and enhancing 
  forest research.</p>
