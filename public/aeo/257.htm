<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS </h3>
<p>Related to the issue of IKS is intellectual property rights (IPR), which has 
  assumed increasing importance in terms of conservation, management, sustainable 
  utilization and benefit sharing of genetic resources. The plunder of African 
  intellectual property rights contributes to human vulnerability, because the 
  region will be unable to derive benefit from its resources, particularly after 
  patenting.</p>
<p>African countries which are particularly rich in genetic resources, traditional 
  knowledge and folklore have an interest in the role of IPR, in the sharing of 
  benefits arising from the patenting and use of biological resources and associated 
  traditional knowledge (WIPO 2001). For example, currently, at least 97 per cent 
  of all patents are held by nationals of countries belonging to the Organization 
  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and at least 90 per cent of 
  all technology and product patents are held by Northernbased global corporations 
  (UNDP 2000, Singh 2001). Similarly, at least 70 per cent of all patent royalty 
  payments are made between the subsidiaries of parent enterprises, and three-quarters 
  of the 76 000-odd patent applications filed to WIPO in 1999 came from just five 
  OECD countries (RAFI 2000c, Singh 2001).</p>
<p>Between 1980 and 1994, the share of global trade involving high-tech, patented 
  production rose from 12 per cent to 24 per cent, and now accounts for more than 
  half of the GDP of OECD countries if intellectual property rights on plants 
  and livestock are included UNDP 1999, Singh 2001). The total revenue from all 
  patents grew from US$15 000 million in 1990 to US$100 000 million in 1998, and 
  is expected to increase to US$500 000 million dollars by 2005 (RAFI 2000c). 
  The number of cases of intellectual appropriation of the South is growing steadily.

              <li> Some 86 per cent of known higher plants, 99 per cent of the 
                world's indigenous people and 96 per cent of the world's farmers 
                live in the South (Africa, Asia and Latin America). </li>
              <li>Some 83 per cent of known diversity and in-situ knowledge is 
                held in the South. </li>
              <li>The South's share of species diversity ranges from a low of 
                52 per cent of known fish species to a high of 91 per cent of 
                reptile species. The South has 87 per cent of the global diversity 
                of higherorder plant species and at least 83 per cent of all forests 
                (tropical and temperate) (RAFI 1996). </li>
              <li>Some 75 per cent of ex-situ resources and technology are in 
                the North (most of which originated in the South), and it is currently 
                beyond the reach of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
                (RAFI 1996). </li>
              <li>Only 22 per cent of all crop gene banks are in the North, but 
                55 per cent of all seed accessions and 62 per cent of all crop 
                species are in the North's collection. The large gene banks of 
                the Consultative Groups on International Agricultural Research 
                (CGIAR), which are located in the South, are controlled by Northern 
                boards and funding agencies. If the CGIAR collections are deducted 
                from the South's ex-situ holdings, its share of banked crop seed 
                will plummet to about one-third of the global total (RAFI 1996).

              <li>Some 83 per cent of recent bio-prospecting projects focus on

                waters and only 6 per cent exclusively on the North (RAFI 1996).</li>
