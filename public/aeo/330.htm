<h3>PROMOTING CROSS-CUTTING ACTIONS </h3>
<p>There are a number of cross-cutting actions which, if carried out, would help 
  to halt and even reverse environmental degradation and reduce human vulnerability. 
  Such actions target: improving coping capacities; promoting increased regional 
  and subregional cooperation; mobilizing domestic financial resources; enhancing 
  institutional capacity; promoting greater involvement of non-governmental organizations; 
  addressing policy failures; defining sustainable development paths; promoting 
  good governance; enforcing compliance; and setting targets and monitoring performance.</p>
<p>Cross-cutting actions that are strongly recommended are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Enhancement of the coping capacities of Africa's population, with regard 
    to adverse environmental change and reduction of environmental insecurity 
    </b><br>
    African governments need to enhance their capacity to anticipate natural disasters 
    and to be able to cope with the ensuing impacts. They also need to invest 
    in early warning mechanisms and disaster preparedness planning, including 
    the formulation of appropriate policies, laws and regulations. They should 
    take steps to promote healthy living that is respectful of the environment, 
    in order to reduce the incidence of diseases associated with environmental 
    degradation. They should also endorse measurement of vulnerability as an important 
    indicator of the state of the environment and, therefore, establish vulnerability 
    assessments and early warning systems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of human resources development </b><br>
    African governments should assess their human resources needs for improved 
    environmental planning and management. They should then put in place training 
    programmes to fill identified gaps. AMCEN, in partnership with sub-regional 
    and international organizations, should provide technical assistance to complement 
    the efforts of national governments, particularly in the areas of identifying 
    and strengthening the capacity of African centres of excellence in environmental 
    planning and management. It should also promote intra-continental exchanges 
    of expertise, collaboration and networking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>The promotion and enhancement of multilevel cooperation </b><br>
    African governments should seek partnerships with the international community, 
    in order to support the operations of the newly formed African Union, and 
    the institutions for sub-regional cooperation and economic integration, such 
    as: the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC); Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought 
    and Development (IGAD); East African Community (EAC); Inter-State Commission 
    to Combat Drought in the Sahel (CILSS); Economic Community of Central African 
    States (ECCAS); the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC); the 
    Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); 
    and Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). AMCEN and sub-regional organizations 
    should facilitate the provision of technical assistance to African governments 
    in formulating programmes of action to support the management of shared water 
    and other transboundary environmental resources. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mobilization of domestic financial resources for environmental management 
    </b><br>
    African governments should make far greater efforts to mobilize domestic resources 
    for investment in environmental management. As an initial step, they need 
    to recognize that environment is a priority area for investment when allocating 
    budgetary resources. Attracting private sector investment for environmental 
    management is also important, and AMCEN and sub-regional organizations should 
    facilitate provision of the technical assistance African governments need 
    to develop win-win strategies. African governments also need to be able to 
    evaluate their natural resources accurately, if they are to develop revenues 
    from sources other than tax. AMCEN should provide them with the technical 
    assistance and accounting methods they require to make such evaluations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Enhancement of institutional capacity to coordinate, monitor and supervise 
    environmental management in Africa </b><br>
    African governments should support AMCEN in defining an appropriate institutional 
    structure which can coordinate, monitor and supervise environmental management 
    on a region-wide basis, and which can provide a stronger voice for Africa 
    in international negotiations and deliberations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of greater involvement of NGOs in environmental management</b> 
    <br>
    African governments should encourage stronger national NGO partnerships in 
    environmental management. Likewise, AMCEN should promote the greater involvement 
    of regional and sub-regional NGOs in environmental management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Greening development plans and strategies at all levels </b><br>
    AMCEN should provide technical assistance to African governments to build 
    capacity for greening of development plans and strategies at national and 
    sub-national levels. In turn, African governments should make the greening 
    of such plans mandatory, and a precondition for allocation of financial resources 
    to the various sectors of the economy and lower levels of government.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Focus on policy failures </b><br>
    African governments have introduced various macroeconomic, social, environmental 
    and sectoral policies to promote sustainable development, and have improved 
    environmental management. Some of these policies have, however, not been very 
    effective and, therefore, need to be reviewed to remove contradictions and 
    other underlying causes of failure. African governments, in partnership with 
    sub-regional, regional and international organizations, need to create capacity 
    for policy analysis, where this is necessary, to ensure timely detection of 
    failures in implementation. They also need to demonstrate greater commitment 
    to the implementation of policies that are adopted.</li>

    <b><a name="img512"></a>Promotion of greater public awareness </b><br>
    African governments and AMCEN, with support from UNEP and other international 
    organizations, have invested significantly in creating greater public awareness 
    of environmental matters and sustainable development. These efforts need to 
    be sustained, particularly at community level. Given the increasing levels 
    of urbanization and industrialization in the region, African governments, 
    in partnership with subregional, regional and international organizations, 
    need to increase public awareness of 'brown issues', such as atmospheric pollution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of environmental education </b><br>
    African governments, in partnership with subregional, regional and international 
    organizations, need to invest in the formulation and implementation of formal 
    and informal environmental education strategies, where these do not exist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improvement of environmental information systems </b><br>
    African governments need to improve environmental information systems as a 
    basis for sound decision making. AMCEN, sub-regional and international organizations 
    should, in partnership with African governments, promote the creation of physical 
    databases at sub-regional and regional levels, and should enhance networking 
    and collaboration between African states.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Definition of sustainable development paths </b><br>
    African countries are at different points along the continuum of development 
    paths which extends from the Fortress World scenario to the Great Transitions 
    scenario discussed in <a href="261.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Where necessary, AMCEN 
    should facilitate the provision of technical assistance to member countries, 
    in order to design feasible and sustainable development paths to lead them 
    from their present positions towards the Great Transitions scenario, within 
    the overall framework of the new African Union and the New Partnership for 
    Africa's Development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of good governance </b><br>
    Although there have been improvements in governance in the Africa region, 
    African governments still need to show real political will and commitment 
    in several areas which, ultimately, aggravate environmental degradation. First, 
    a lack of democratic institutions and the persistence of corruption in some 
    places contribute to inefficient use of resources. AMCEN, and sub-regional 
    and international organizations, should encourage African governments to address 
    the problem of corruption and to develop effective governance regimes that 
    are favourable to sustainable development, where these are not in place. Conflicts 
    and their aftermath also impact on the environment when, for example, refugees 
    and displaced persons, through no fault of their own, increase the burden 
    on already over-stretched resources in a host country. To address such problems, 
    African governments should use conflict-minimization strategies to help to 
    promote peaceful coexistence, and to avoid situations that lead to displacement 
    of people. Resource scarcities have been, and continue to be, major causes 
    of conflict among states. AMCEN and sub-regional groupings should, therefore, 
    assist African countries in effectively managing transboundary resources, 
    so as to avoid conflict.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Enforcement of compliance </b><br>
    Although there are various laws and regulations governing environmental management 
    in Africa, their enforcement is generally weak. Greater and more effective 
    capacity is needed for the enforcement of existing laws and regulations. AMCEN, 
    in partnership with international and subregional organizations, should identify 
    strengths and weaknesses in compliance and enforcement, and recommended areas, 
    to build the capacity of law enforcement agencies and their judiciaries, in 
    order to allow them to better appreciate their roles in environmental management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Setting targets and monitoring performance </b><br>
    African governments need to demonstrate to the rest of the world, and to their 
    own people, real improvements and success stories in environmental management. 
    This calls for the measurement of performance over time which, in turn, requires 
    setting targets and monitoring of programmes. AMCEN should persuade African 
    governments to agree on regional targets for environmental management. Furthermore, 
    through partnerships with national, sub-regional and international organizations, 
    AMCEN should monitor progress towards the attainment of the agreed targets 
    for environmental management, at least in the medium term. AMCEN should also 
    seek support for continued production of the AEO as part of the monitoring 
    process. African governments should support the production of sub-regional 
    state-ofenvironment reports that would subsequently feed into the AEO process, 
    where such reports do not currently exist.</li>
