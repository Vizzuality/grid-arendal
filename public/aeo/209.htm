<h2>EASTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Eastern Africa is the least urbanized sub-region in Africa, with 26 per cent 
  of its population living in towns and cities (UNCHS 2001a). Within the sub-region, 
  Djibouti is the most urbanized country with 83 per cent of the population in 
  urban areas; Rwanda is the least urbanized at 6 per cent, although the recent 
  violent conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi are likely to have impacted enormously 
  on demographic patterns (UNCHS 2001a). Eastern Africa does, however, have the 
  highest rate of urbanization of Africa's sub-regions (expected to average 4.5 
  per cent over the next 15 years), so the pattern is changing rapidly (UNCHS 
  2001a). Only a few cities in the sub-region currently have populations in excess 
  of one million, namely Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) with 2.6 million, Kampala (Uganda) 
  with 1.2 million, Mogadishu (Somalia) with 1.2 million, and Nairobi (Kenya) 
  with 2.3 million (UNCHS 2001a).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN EASTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Rapid urban growth since the 1960s has resulted from growth of existing urban 
  populations and from migration to urban centres of people either seeking refuge 
  from poverty-stricken rural areas and declining agricultural productivity, or 
  coming in search of employment, and improved security of income and housing 
  tenure. This pattern has created a high demand for housing and urban services. 
  However, economic growth has lagged growth of population and urbanization, recording 
  on average a slight negative trend in the 1990-98 period, although with wide 
  differences between countries. Uganda, for example, reported net economic growth 
  of 3.5 per cent in the period, whereas Burundi reported a net loss of 4.2 per 
  cent (UNDP 2000). Negative economic growth has resulted in fewer funds being 
  available for development and maintenance of infrastructure, in increased unemployment, 
  and in people being less able to afford basic housing and services.</p>

      <p>Residents in unplanned settlements tend to pay more for water consumed. 
        For instance, in Nairobi, residents of unplanned settlements paid between 
        30 cents and 70 cents for a 20-litre container of water, compared to 17 
        cents per 20-litre container paid by consumers with water meters</p>

<p>Proliferation of slums and unplanned settlements in urban areas of Eastern 
  Africa has been accompanied by inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation. 
  Water supply is not only insufficient, but is also intermittent in unplanned 
  and low-income residential areas. On average, access to clean water in the subregion's 
  urban areas is 80 per cent, ranging from 100 per cent in Djibouti to 60 per 
  cent in Eritrea (WHO/UNICEF 2000<sup>1</sup>). Access to sanitation in urban 
  areas ranges from 99 per cent in Djibouti to 12 per cent in Rwanda, with an 
  average of 72 per cent (WHO/UNICEF 2000). In both cases, this represents a slight 
  improvement on the situation in 1990 (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Residents in unplanned 
  settlements also tend to pay more for water consumed. For instance, in Nairobi, 
  residents of unplanned settlements paid between 30 cents and 70 cents for a 
  20 litre container of water, compared to 17 cents per 20 litre container paid 
  by consumers with water meters (USAID 1993). Inadequate water for cleansing 
  and for sanitation creates opportunities for disease and pests to breed and 
  spread.</p>

<a name="img2g4"></a>Discharges of raw sewage into rivers and lakes have also 
increased, creating a toxic environment for plant and animal communities, as well 
as for humans. Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean coast are particularly affected 
(as evidenced by frequent episodes of eutrophication) owing to the concentration 
of towns and cities in these areas. Governments in the sub-region have yet to 
put in place effective policy measures and regulations to arrest the situation. 
However, a programme to privatize municipal services in Eastern Africa was launched 
by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in the second half of the 1990s 
(UNCHS 1998). Improvements in water supply and sanitation have been made in Kenya 
and Uganda, although collection of payments is a serious limitation to maintenance 
of infrastructure and viability of continued operations (UNCHS 1998). 
<h4>Unplanned settlements in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Unplanned settlements have mushroomed in Eastern Africa, with negative impacts 
  on the social and biophysical environment. In Nairobi, for instance, about 55 
  per cent of the population were living in unplanned settlements in 1993 (USAID 
  1993) and approximately 5 per cent of residents in Entebbe and 16 per cent in 
  Jinja (Uganda) are squatters (UNCHS 2001c). Balbala, an unplanned settlement 
  of 240 000 residents in the city of Djibouti, accounted for the largest share 
  of the city's growth during the last decade (UNCDF 1998). Population densities 
  in these settlements are usually very high, which encourages the transmission 
  of diseases such as parasites and respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>In response to this situation, governments have taken measures to enact housing 
  policies that will support an environmentally sustainable housing sector. For 
  example, Uganda formulated a Housing Policy in 1978 that influenced the upgrading 
  of Namuwongo lowcost housing and Masese Women's Self-Help housing projects. 
  The National Housing Strategy was completed in 1992, a Land Tenure Policy was 
  prepared, and services and planning have been decentralized. Capacity building 
  for land use planning is still urgently required. In Kenya the government drafted 
  a new housing policy in 1999 giving priority to upgrading of slum areas with 
  minimal displacement, to allow for proper planning and provision of necessary 
  infrastructure and related services. Between 1971 and 1991, the City of Nairobi 
  received World Bank funding to provide urban housing and water supply and sanitation. 
  An evaluation of the projects revealed that water supply had kept pace with 
  the urban population growth and tariff restructuring had helped in keeping water 
  affordable (World Bank 1996). About 65 per cent of the urban population now 
  has water-borne sewerage, and significant environmental improvements have been 
  noticed. A development project in the Balbala quarter of Djibouti brought improvements 
  to living conditions for 1 164 families and established a development model 
  setting standards for future infrastructure, equipment, and housing development 
  (UNCDF 1998). Additional responses in Eastern African cities include the development 
  and/or implementation of local environmental plans in Bujumbura (Burundi), Addis 
  Ababa, Mombasa (Kenya), Kigali (Rwanda), and Entebbe (UNCHS 2001c).</p>
