<h2>FRESHWATER </h2>
<p>Lack of availability and inadequate quality of freshwater are the two most 
  limiting factors for development in Africa, constraining food production and 
  industrial activities and contributing significantly to the burden of disease.</p>

<p>Western and Central African countries have relatively abundant freshwater resources 
  and fairly predictable rainfall. However, the distribution of human populations 
  in these countries is such that the various user groups nevertheless experience 
  difficulties and disparities in access to water resources. For example, the 
  rural poor have to walk long distances to collect water for domestic consumption 
  whereas agricultural and industrial users have access to subsidized resources.</p>
<p>Most other countries, particularly those in Northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, 
  and in the Sahel, experience extreme variability and unpredictability in rainfall 
  as well as frequent drought. User groups experience disparities in access to 
  water resources, with Southern African countries showing the widest disparity 
  in terms of both access and consumption.</p>
<p>Almost all African countries experience problems of water quality and are struggling 
  to upgrade water treatment and wastewater processing plants. At present, large 
  quantities of industrial and domestic wastewater are discharged untreated into 
  watercourses and coastal waters and the resulting pollution poses a risk to 
  human and aquatic life. Pollution of freshwater also compounds the existing 
  problems of water availability by raising the costs of treatment and supply.</p>
<p>Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is a new, multi-stakeholder approach 
  to meeting the challenges of water supply by curbing demand from certain user 
  groups and encouraging re-use and recycling, as well as management of aquatic 
  ecosystems and making provision for environmental water requirements. Although 
  there is increasing recognition of the need for, and benefits of, adopting such 
  an approach in African countries, implementation will only be effective if it 
  is supported by adequate finances, and by trained personnel with adequate facilities. 
  Coordination between government departments responsible for water supply and 
  use must be brought in line with the common goal of sustainable use of resources.
