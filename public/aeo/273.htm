<h2>SCENARIOS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<h3>THE MARKET FORCES SCENARIO</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Market Forces scenario assumes that world development evolves without major 
  discontinuities, changes in values or other structural ruptures from the position 
  as it existed at the end of the 20th century. However, in this scenario, the 
  world becomes increasingly more integrated, both economically and culturally. 
  Globalization of product and labour markets continues apace, catalysed by free 
  trade agreements, unregulated capital and financial flows, and information technology. 
  A number of important initiatives pave the way. The World Trade Organization 
  (WTO) provides the legal basis for the global trading system. Barriers to trade 
  and capital movements gradually vanish, as protectionism becomes a thing of 
  the past. New institutional instruments promote market openness and global competition. 
  Virtually all national governments advance a package of policy adjustments, 
  which include: modernization of financial systems; investment in education to 
  create a workforce that is competitive in the emerging global market; privatization; 
  reduced social safety nets; and, in general, reliance on market-based approaches.</p>
<p>In the context of Africa, the Market Forces scenario is based on the assumption 
  that African countries will adopt, willingly or otherwise, the range of policy 
  reforms promoted by the WB and the IMF since the late 1980s. These reforms aim 
  to improve the economic performance of developing countries by encouraging them 
  to restructure their economies through a combination of tight fiscal and monetary 
  policies. The objective is to limit budget deficits and to allow marketdetermined 
  interest rates, more free trade, capital flows and unencumbered foreign direct 
  investment. The reforms also include: privatization of state enterprises; extension 
  and consolidation of private property rights; and a shift in public expenditure 
  away from subsidies and administration towards infrastructure development and 
  support for sectors of the economy-such as primary health care and education-which 
  are likely to provide ultimately greater economic returns and more equitable 
  income distribution. From a trade perspective, the main outcomes of this strategy 
  are: global integration of commodity markets; opening up of investment markets; 
  more mobile labour markets; and the application of global standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The assumptions of the Market Forces scenario may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dominant western model of development prevails, with the spread of consumerism/materialism 
    and individualism. The world economy converges to this mode.</li>
  <li>Policies promoted by international financial institutions are adopted, either 
    willingly or otherwise, and they are found to have positive impacts on aggregate 
    growth as the scenario progresses.</li>
  <li>The most effective poverty-reduction strategy is growth promotion. Growth 
    will tend to be broadbased and will trickle down.</li>
  <li>Effective institutions will emerge and spread.</li>
  <li>Economic growth will automatically contribute to recover the environmental 
    damage incurred as a result of development.</li>
  <li>An active policy-making environment is in place. However, although policies 
    are implemented, they tend to be market-based.</li>
</ul>
