<p>Although environmental issues have been presented here by theme, it is important 
  to recognize they are inter-linked and that they therefore need to be addressed 
  with an integrated environmental management approach. <a href="#fig2s8">Figure 
  2s.8</a> illustrates links between stresses on land and water resources, others 
  are highlighted below.</p>
<p>Deforestation and loss of vegetation cover increase the risk of soil erosion, 
  which in turn impacts on aquatic and coastal ecosystems through sedimentation 
  and smothering of habitats. This reduces water availability and quality and 
  contributes to coastal erosion, exacerbating the impacts of climate change on 
  freshwater resources and of sea level rise. Deforestation also affects climatic 
  conditions reducing rainfall and run-off at the micro level (thereby also impacting 
  on freshwater availability and aquatic ecosystems) and contributes to global 
  warming and its impacts at the macro level.</p>
<p>Reductions in rainfall (natural or induced through changes such as deforestation) 
  also impact on infrastructure and urban development, particularly on electricity 
  generation in many parts of Africa where hydro-electric power is well developed. 
  Power shortages and poorly developed central power supplies contribute to deforestation 
  by increasing the population's dependence on wood and charcoal for fuel.</p>
<p>Loss of natural habitat because of urban and agricultural sprawl contributes 
  to declines in biodiversity, loss of economic development potential, and support 
  for livelihoods. Endangerment and extinction of certain species (terrestrial, 
  aquatic, and marine) put pressure on other resources as substitutes are sought 
  to meet people's requirements. Changing patterns of resource distribution also 
  affect life cycles of pests and diseases, and may in turn impact on human health, 
  and crop and livestock yields.</p>
<p>Alien invasive plants cause changes to freshwater availability and alter the 
  diversity and abundance of species within ecosystems. Aquatic weeds also change 
  water quality by adding or removing nutrients and thus affect drinking water 
  quality and human health.</p>
