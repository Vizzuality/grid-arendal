<h3>LAND RIGHTS IN NORTHERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Current land tenure policies in northern Africa have been derived from pre-colonial 
  and colonial tenure systems, largely influenced by the type of land use most 
  appropriate for various areas, and economic pressures of different periods. 
  Although they may have once been optimal for enhancing productivity under the 
  prevailing social and demographic situations, tenure policies have not always 
  kept pace with changing demographic patterns, demand for resources or national 
  priorities. Thus, resource overexploitation is apparent in some areas, contrasting 
  with inefficient use of resources in other areas. Lack of tenurial security 
  has been reported as a major constraint to land development (FAO 1992) and, 
  throughout the sub-region, much land remains under poorly defined ownership. 
  Much of it is 'open access', although sometimes called 'common property', and 
  large proportions are state-owned. Until recently, 20 per cent of Tunisia's 
  total land area (3 million ha) was under communal ownership, and 6 per cent 
  was stateowned. However, in 1991, the government privatized 1.2 million ha of 
  agricultural land and 600 000 ha of rangelands (World Bank 2000a). This reflects 
  a change in economic and social thinking towards more commercial production. 
  Access to land resources is a primary determinant for development, and is considered 
  a major factor responsible for the failure of some governments to engage the 
  people in land development programmes. In some countries, such as Libya, the 
  state assumes ownership of any land which is not assigned to sedentary populations, 
  that is, they have nationalized lands held in some sense collectively by local 
  communities (Harbeson 1990).</p>
<p>Land tenure reform processes in the sub-region attempt to optimize land use, 
  minimize degradation and stem the rapid rates of urbanization. Many of the governments 
  in the sub-region have also adopted liberalization and structural reform policies, 
  that is, marketing, pricing and trading produced food and agricultural commodities 
  with the removal or minimization of subsidies for inputs. Policies have been 
  adopted to enhance exports and foreign trade. Measures have been taken to encourage 
  intra-regional trade, through bilateral trade agreements among the countries 
  of northern Africa, and the establishment of free trade zones. Research efforts 
  to enhance sustainable development have also been encouraged. Greater participation 
  of stakeholders through farmers and users associations is receiving greater 
  attention, and gender issues are being discussed.</p>
<p>In Tunisia, for example, land reform has focused on the settlement of land 
  claims through the registration and certification of ownership, and through 
  a dual plan for promoting economic stability and environmental protection (World 
  Bank 2000a). However, despite the government's attempts to encourage registration, 
  half of all eligible lands have not been registered and, even amongst registered 
  lands, successive land transfers often go unrecorded. The process of privatizing 
  state and collectively owned lands has also been slow, as has the emergence 
  of land markets. Fragmentation of land and resources remains a principal concern, 
  which the government is attempting to redress by means of: legislative modifications; 
  extension programmes; and improved administrative procedures (Gharbi 1998). 
  In Morocco, until recently, land was owned by the state, by religious orders 
  or by communities. The government has encouraged land reform through incentives 
  for: streamlining registration; limiting fragmentation; the standardization 
  of tenant contracts; and the privatization of state-owned and church-owned lands. 
  A recent report concludes that private tenureship provides greater security 
  and greater incentives for investment in land improvements, such as access to 
  financing (Taleb 1998).</p>
