<h3>THE REGIONAL IMPORTANCE OF CULTIVATION AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The contribution of agriculture to the formal economy and to employment in 
  many African countries, although substantial, does not take account of the significant 
  contribution of small-scale cultivation and livestock production to livelihoods. 
  Nor does it represent the cultural value of terrestrial resources (particularly 
  livestock), or the ways in which traditional practices have shaped the environment. 
  In many countries, for example, cattle provide the primary source of dietary 
  protein, are traded for cereals, and contribute to the ploughing and fertilization 
  of cultivated areas (FAO 1997a). Thus, the total value of terrestrial resources 
  is much greater than reflected in the figures that follow below.</p>
<p>Agriculture employs the largest number of workers, and generates a significant 
  share of gross domestic product (GDP) in many African countries. In 1990, the 
  agricultural sector accounted for 68 per cent of the workforce in sub-Saharan 
  Africa, and 37 per cent of the workforce in northern Africa. This compared with 
  industry, which accounted for 9 per cent and 25 per cent of the workforce respectively 
  (World Bank 2001). In 1999, agriculture contributed more than US$64 484 million 
  to the economy of sub-Saharan Africa (18 per cent of GDP for 1999), and US$26 
  188 million to northern Africa (13 per cent of GDP in 1999) (World Bank 2001).</p>
<p>The main commercial crops grown in the region are: cereals; cocoa; coffee; 
  cotton; fruit; nuts and seeds; oils; rubber; spices; sugar; tea; tobacco; and 
  vegetables. These contribute significantly (alongside minerals and metals) to 
  exports and foreign exchange earnings. In 2001, for example, Africa produced 
  67 per cent of the world's cocoa, 16 per cent of the world's coffee, and 5 per 
  cent of world's cereal production (FAOSTAT 2001). Livestock and livestock products 
  contribute about 19 per cent to the total production value from agriculture, 
  forestry and fisheries in sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 1997a). Animal production 
  is highly skewed towards the drier regions, with Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan 
  and Tanzania accounting for 50 per cent of Africa's animal production (FAO 1997a).</p>
<p>This dependency on agriculture was highlighted by a World Bank (WB) study in 
  1993, which found that a 1 per cent growth in agricultural production in Africa 
  can stimulate 1.5 per cent overall economic growth, due to positive impacts 
  on industry, transport and other services (World Bank 1993a). Agriculture has, 
  therefore, been the focus of strategies and hopes for economic development over 
  the past three decades (for example, African Development Bank 1998). However, 
  the full potential for development in agriculture has not been realized.</p>
<p>Most agriculture in Africa is rain-fed (except in northern African countries 
  and the Western Indian Ocean Island states, where irrigation potential has been 
  well developed), and most African countries experience large inter-annual and 
  intra-annual variations in rainfall, with frequent extremes of flooding or drought. 
  Thus, vulnerability to crop failure translates into economic insecurity. In 
  addition, African farmers have been heavily taxed through price-fixing, export 
  taxes and taxes on agricultural inputs, whilst countries outside the region 
  have enjoyed massive subsidization (Wolfensohn 2001, World Bank 1994, Oyejide 
  1993). Furthermore, many African economies are dependent on a narrow range of 
  agricultural commodities, creating greater vulnerability to failure (resulting 
  from outbreaks of pests, climatic variations, price fluctuations and so on). 
  For example, the same nine commodities (banana, cocoa, coffee, cotton, groundnut, 
  rubber, sugar, tea and tobacco) accounted for 70 per cent of the region's agricultural 
  exports over the period 1970-1995 (Oyejide 1999). Between the 1960s and the 
  mid-1990s, a number of economic shocks hit Africa's agricultural base, with 
  the result that market share for a number of commodities declined sharply, including: 
  cocoa (for which market share declined by 50 per cent); coffee (42 per cent); 
  and cotton (35 per cent). Groundnuts suffered the most dramatic decline in market 
  share, from 70 per cent to just 2 per cent over this period (Oyejide 1999).</p>
<p>However, over the past decade and, in particular, over the last half of the 
  past decade, there have been signs of an economic recovery in several African 
  countries (World Bank 2001), and agricultural value added in Africa grew by 
  4 per cent between 1990 and 1997 (Oyejide 1999). Continued agricultural development 
  and global competitiveness requires the liberalization of domestic pricing, 
  and improved export market access and, therefore, participation in world trade 
  negotiations is critical for the region.</p>
