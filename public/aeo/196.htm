<h3>LAND RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AFRICA </h3>
<p>One of the most important issues related to land and natural resources management 
  in central Africa is the form of land tenure and the system of access rights. 
  These policies have a direct effect on people's security and on their investment 
  in land and resources management which, in turn, affect productivity and land 
  quality. The procedures and conditions of land attribution are cumbersome and 
  complex, and there are a number of disparities between traditional and modern 
  rights to land ownership. Whereas traditional land rights are granted through 
  inheritance, and are centred on communal access to resources, statutory laws 
  encourage state and private ownership, with the emphasis on commercial production 
  rather than on household production. Differences between customary and statutory 
  law produce conflicting situations on the ground, and can lead to disputes over 
  access to resources. As elsewhere in Africa, the interests of certain population 
  groups with lower levels of political recognition (including pastoralists, women 
  and certain castes) are often marginalized (IIED 1999). Rapid population growth 
  and migration in the sub-region have added to the pressures on land resources, 
  especially on commercial production in the more fertile coastal zones. The influence 
  of Islamic law in some areas, and interventions by development projects, add 
  further complexity to the allocation of resource distribution and access rights 
  (IIED 1999).</p>
<p>Where there is insecurity in land tenure, or competing interests for land use, 
  incentives to invest in adequate land management are reduced, thereby increasing 
  vulnerability to degradation and conflict. An example of this is the large area 
  around Lake Chad (northern Cameroon, Chad and Central African Republic), which 
  is used primarily by migratory herdsmen. Their livestock often compete with 
  settled cultivators for land and water, sometimes resulting in violent clashes 
  (Njinyam 1998). The wetter areas in the coastal zone of central Africa are not 
  suitable, due to the widespread occurrence of tsetse flies (which carry trypanosmiasis) 
  and other diseases. Thus, the arid savannas of the north are vital resources, 
  and assured access to dry-season grazing reserves and crop residues in villages 
  is necessary, in order to ensure the continued significant contribution of livestock 
  production to local communities and national economies (IIED 1999).</p>
<p>In Cameroon, the declaration of conservation areas under the colonial administration 
  has alienated local communities from land and resources which they owned under 
  customary laws. Their claims to the land are not recognized, and any occupation 
  or use of such areas must be negotiated with the relevant responsible state 
  department (Vabi and Sikod 2000). This situation has resulted in the communities 
  exercising de facto user rights in a manner of open access, and these activities 
  are rarely incorporated into conservation areas management plans. Better communication 
  and planning between conservation authorities and local communities is required, 
  in order to meet the objectives of both parties in a sustainable way (Vabi and 
  Sikod 2000).</p>
<p>In response to the various impacts at national level, most countries have elaborated 
  land-zoning plans which indicate the boundaries for various land uses. Registration 
  and titling have also been used in some countries, as a means of improving tenure 
  security, in order to encourage investment in agricultural inputs. However, 
  this has been hampered by the enormous administrative burden of reclassification 
  and recording, and it has not been able to effectively promote access rights 
  for women or pastoralists (IIED 1999). Land reform is also challenged by the 
  existing overlaps and contradictions between traditional customary laws, land 
  use practices and statutory laws. These need to be resolved as a first step 
  in delivering a more equitable and workable system of land rights.</p>
<p>In Chad, the government passed a Forest Code in 1989, confirming the dominant 
  role of the state in ownership of forest land. However, this code simply replaced 
  the customary laws, and placed sole responsibility for administration with the 
  central government. Decentralization of government to local authorities may 
  relieve the administrative burden of central ministries, thus improving the 
  effectiveness of the system and speeding up the process of reform (IIED 1999). 
  To improve effectiveness, stakeholder dialogue and voluntary participation need 
  to be encouraged, and policy reform needs to be complemented with initiatives 
  that target the underlying causes of land degradation, and promote food self-sufficiency 
  and economic development (IIED 1999). In addition, the lessons learned from 
  the implementation of CBNRMs could be incorporated into law reform, such as: 
  options for the co-management of forest and wildlife resources; and improving 
  conflict resolution mechanisms (IIED 1999). CILSS, the sub-regional resource 
  management organization, provides a useful structure for encouraging such debate 
  and sharing of experiences between countries with similar challenges.</p>
