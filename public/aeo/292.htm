<h4><i>Forests</i></h4>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, dependence on biomass, the traditional fuel 
  in Africa-which supplied 52 per cent of all energy requirements in the region 
  in the 20th century (WRI 1994)-is reduced, because people have more energy choices. 
  Both public and private power utilities compete to provide electricity to both 
  urban and rural areas, making such services more reliable. The result is that 
  the rate of deforestation, due to fuelwood demand and charcoal production, is 
  reduced considerably.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Central 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The legal framework clarifies the involvement of the local population and defines, 
  with their participation, the conditions of their involvement. Local populations 
  participate in the conservation of forest resources. The industries exploit 
  forests within a revamped legal framework. New technologies are developed and 
  are introduced in logging. The research works continue, with the involvement 
  of research programmes in forest planning through the use of modern technologies.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Eastern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>This sub-region has 11.4 per cent of the total forest cover in Africa, making 
  forests one of the key resources in the region. Realizing the great economic 
  and social value of the resource, and the sub-region's comparative advantage 
  in the Africa region, measures-including policy reviews-are undertaken to increase 
  the level of conservation and to increase forest cover. Private investment is 
  attracted to the sector, initially in the area of forest exploitation, but gradually 
  moving into private plantations. The sub-region becomes a major supplier of 
  timber products to the neighbouring sub-regions of Southern and Northern Africa. 
  The role played by forests in catchment protection for the Nile waters is acknowledged, 
  and bilateral agreements are reached to increase investment in catchment forestry, 
  with significant contribution from the lower riparian states. Carbon trading 
  becomes an active commercial transaction for the countries of Uganda, Rwanda, 
  Ethiopia and Kenya, all of which have significant forest coverage and are willing 
  to maintain the forests for carbon sequestration. Forests also continue to be 
  the major source of energy, especially for the poor segments of the population, 
  and governments take deliberate steps to promote agroforestry in their poverty 
  eradication action plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The governments realize that, despite the fact that forests only occupy very 
  small areas of this sub-region, their environmental and economic values are 
  much bigger. The long issued legislations regarding forests are reviewed and 
  strengthened. More importantly, they are strictly enforced in order to achieve 
  their goals. The impact of the forest protection and restoration efforts does 
  not show up quickly, but certainly became identifiable by 2032. Nevertheless, 
  nature still plays its role, and accounts for losing some forest areas. As the 
  sub-region understands how to deal with such disasters, their impacts are reduced. 
  Forests remain the primary source of cheap energy for poor people, but their 
  use is on such a limited scale that it does not adversely affect the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Southern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>New technologies are found through the channelling of more funds into research 
  and development in microenergy sources, resulting in lower levels of deforestation. 
  However, use of the abundant fossil fuels (coal) grows, but using technologies 
  that are less polluting.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, the priority in dealing with forests in this 
  sub-region is forestation in the countries that are being encroached upon by 
  the Sahara Desert, and reforestation in previously forested countries. Evidence 
  abounds about the successes of these policies. Because of the successes, a good 
  balance is struck between reconstruction and other activities which require 
  forest products, and maintaining a healthy environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>West 
  Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Reforestation gathers momentum and exotic varieties are reduced, remaining 
  largely in private gardens, with minimal influence on ecosystems. Mango swamps, 
  however, suffer continual degradation as beach areas are opened up for tourism.</p>
