<h4>The narratives</h4>
<p>The Policy Reform scenario is the Market Forces scenario with a human face. 
  It not only embraces the market-driven prescriptions of the Breton Woods institutions-the 
  IMF and the WB-but it is also strong on social and environmental policies. The 
  Market Forces scenario is premised on the so-called Washington Consensus, which 
  says that good economic performance requires liberalized trade, macroeconomic 
  stability and getting prices right (Stiglitz 1998). The Washington Consensus 
  supporters 'unreservedly promote free trade, financial liberalization and foreign 
  investment incentives, business deregulation low taxes, fiscal austerity and 
  privatization, and flexible labour markets' (Bond 2000; see also <a href="#box41">Box 
  4.1</a>).</p>

<p>For Africa, the Policy Reform scenario offers an opportunity for the region 
  to break with more than four decades of 'unfulfilled promises of global development 
  strategies' (OAU 1980). For instance, in the years between decolonization, which 
  began with Ghana in 1957, and the democratization of South Africa in 1994, the 
  region has been 'unable to point to any significant growth rate, or satisfactory 
  index of general well-being' (OAU 1980). Some of the important challenges facing 
  Africa at the beginning of the 21st century, therefore, include: a population 
  which is growing rapidly, at a rate which is faster than food production and 
  which is beyond the capacity of some resources to satisfy such demand; growing 
  poverty in both rural and urban areas; millions of refugees, due to wars in 
  different subregions; growing urbanization, introducing new environmental issues; 
  HIV/AIDS; land degradation, particularly desertification; deforestation; recurrent 
  droughts; increasing demand on the finite water resources; water pollution; 
  and biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Since the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, Africa has 
  participated in many conferences, such as: the 1990 World Conference on Education 
  for All; the 1990 World Summit for Children; the 1992 United Nations Conference 
  on Environment and Development; the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights; the 
  1994 International Conference on Population and Development; the 1995 United 
  Nations Fourth Conference on Women; and the 2000 Millennium Summit. In addition 
  to these international initiatives, African countries have also convened their 
  own important meetings, which have set targets for economic and social development, 
  and environmental management. Meetings under the auspices of the Organization 
  of African Unity (OAU), which led to the adoption of the Lagos Plan of Action-the 
  region's blueprint for economic development-in 1980 have helped to highlight 
  the challenges facing the region. Under the Lagos Plan of Action, African leaders 
  emphasized that 'Africa's huge resources must be applied principally to meet 
  the needs and purposes of its people'. They also emphasized the need for Africa's 
  virtually 'total reliance on the export of raw materials' to change, and for 
  the need to mobilize the region's entire human and material resources for the 
  development of Africa (OAU 1980).</p>
<p>The Lagos Plan of Action is one of many measures adopted by the region which 
  set qualitative and/or quantitative targets that should have been met by the 
  new millennium. Unfortunately, many of these targets remain unmet, largely because 
  of errors of judgement, of both omission and commission. Nonetheless, the 21st 
  century marks the beginning of a new dawn. The symphony created by an informed 
  populace, fully familiar with its rights; the commitment by political leaders 
  to serve their people rather than their egos; the development of strong legal 
  and institutional frameworks; the willingness by all stakeholders to constantly 
  keep their development plans under review; the development of a strong entrepreneurial 
  base; and breakthroughs in science and technology see Africa claim its place 
  as one of the leading regions in the world. Africa takes policy reform seriously, 
  looking within for any shortcomings and enhancing its strengths.</p>
