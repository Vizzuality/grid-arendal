<p><a name="fig2f1"></a>Stretching 7 680 km north to south and 7 200 km from east 
  to west, Africa is the second largest region in the world, accounting for 20 
  per cent of the world's land mass (2 963 313 000 hectares (ha)) (FAOSTAT 2001). 
  Some 66 per cent of Africa is classified as arid or semiarid, and the region 
  experiences extreme variability in rainfall (UNEP 1999a). Climatic regimes are 
  roughly symmetrical around the equator, and are mirrored in the pattern of vegetation. 
  Thus, dense tropical forests are found in the high-rainfall equatorial belt, 
  with a gradient to both north and south, through savannas, grasslands and deserts. 
  Approximately 22 per cent of Africa's land area is under forest (650 million 
  ha), 43 per cent is characterized as extreme deserts (1 274 million ha), and 
  21 per cent (630 million ha) is suitable for cultivation (FAO 2001a, Reich, 
  Numbem, Almaraz and Eswaran 2001, UNEP 1999a). By 1999, it was estimated that 
  about 200 million ha (32 per cent of the suitable area) had actually been cultivated 
  (FAOSTAT 2001). At the same time, it was estimated that 30 per cent of the total 
  land area (892 million ha) were being used as permanent pasture (FAOSTAT 2001).</p>
<p>Africa has abundant natural terrestrial resources and potential for economic, 
  social and environmental development. Patterns of land use in Africa are equally 
  diverse and complex, extending beyond agriculture (which, in this context, refers 
  to both cultivation of crops and rearing of livestock). However, many of these 
  have been discussed in other sections of this chapter, and the key issues identified 
  for this section are land quality and productivity, and land tenure, as they 
  relate to food production systems and food security. <a href="#fig2f1">Figure 
  2f.1</a> shows the different types of land cover and patterns of land use in 
  Africa.</p>

<p>The people of Africa are largely rural, and they traditionally practice small-scale 
  cultivation, or pastoralism, which is more common in the more arid areas of 
  northern, eastern and southern Africa. Pastoralists herd cattle, camels, sheep 
  and goats, and migrate according to the seasonal abundance of fodder for the 
  livestock. Although men and women both play important roles in agriculture, 
  the production and preparation of food for the household is the main activity 
  for most rural women (FAO 2001b). Cultivation is also an important means of 
  supplementing diets and incomes in urban areas, and urban agriculture is growing 
  faster in Africa than in any other region of the world (Asomani- Boateng and 
  Haight 1999, Mougeot 1998). Other land resources are also widely used, both 
  at the household level and commercially. These include: medicinal products; 
  raw materials for construction and crafts; bushmeat; and wood for fuel. Together, 
  they contribute up to 50 per cent of household food requirements and up to 40 
  per cent of household incomes (for example, Ashley and LaFranchi 1997, Cavendish 
  1999). This direct dependency of most Africans on land, and the heavy economic 
  dependence of many African countries on agricultural (as well as mineral) resources, 
  create a unique regard for land in Africa, as well as unique production pressures 
  and competition for resources.
