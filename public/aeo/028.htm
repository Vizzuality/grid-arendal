<h3>2002 WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>In August-September 2002, Africa will host the World Summit on Sustainable 
  Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa-a major milestone for a region 
  which faces many environmental challenges. The main objective of the WSSD is 
  to review progress made on sustainable development since the 1992 Rio Earth 
  Summit. The main focus points for Africa are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eradicating poverty in African countries, through the formulation and implementation 
    of policies<br>
    that are conducive to the enhancement of domestic savings, as well as allowing 
    external<br>
    resource inflows, such as foreign direct investment. </li>
  <li>Promoting education, which will require African countries to establish new 
    institutions, or to<br>
    strengthen existing institutions, in order to enhance their ability to respond 
    to new and<br>
    longer-term challenges, instead of concentrating on immediate problems.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Providing new, and improving on existing, healthcare institutions, in order 
    to reduce the incidence of disease in Africa. This will require a<br>
    broad development approach, with health sector<br>
    reforms going hand-in-hand with poverty<br>
    reduction, conflict prevention and community<br>
    participation. Among the most urgent areas for<br>
    action in African countries is the HIV/AIDS<br>
    pandemic, which is a serious impediment to<br>
    sustainable development and growth.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ta king new and strong measures in the management and use of biodiversity, 
    including<br>
    forest and marine ecosystems and resources. Strategies to implement these 
    programmes could<br>
    include: 
    <ul>
      <li>developing national forest programmes, in accordance with each country's 
        national<br>
        conditions, objectives and priorities; strengthening political commitment 
        in the<br>
        management, conservation and sustainable development of forests;<br>
        undertaking concrete actions to share equitably the benefits arising from 
        the use of<br>
        genetic resources; </li>
      <li>recognizing the role of women in the conservation of biological diversity 
        and the<br>
        sustainable use of biological resources; </li>
      <li>providing necessary support to integrate the conservation of biological 
        diversity and the<br>
        sustainable use of biological resources into national development plans; 
        and<br>
      </li>
      <li>promoting the involvement of communities, the private sector, NGOs and 
        other stakeholders in<br>
        the management of forests, with a view to ensuring the equitable sharing 
        of the benefits<br>
        accruing from forest resources. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ratifying the 1997 UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol to<br>
    control greenhouse gas emissions, which are<br>
    believed to be a major factor in climate change,<br>
    which threatens African countries.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Switching to higher value-added resource<br>
    industries, where African countries will have a<br>
    comparative advantage, and promoting the<br>
    diversification of industrial production.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Taking all necessary measures to guarantee a<br>
    pollution-free environment, especially with respect<br>
    to toxic wastes, including: 
    <ul>
      <li>ratification and implementation of all relevant conventions;</li>
      <li>development of skilled personnel and testing equipment required for 
        the effective detection and monitoring of the movements of hazardous wastes; 
        and </li>
      <li>strengthening the respective institutions and enacting legislation, 
        in order to facilitate the smooth implementation of the conventions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reviewing national development planning options.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Promoting communication, and removing the<br>
    digital gap that currently exists between Africa and<br>
    the rich nations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Promoting trade with targeted strategies, including: 
    <ul>
      <li>developing higher value-added resource-based industries;<br>
      </li>
      <li>broadening the production base; allowing the establishment of, and the<br>
        strengthening of, regional trade; </li>
      <li>forging ahead with regional integration, in order to increase Africa's 
        share of global trade;<br>
        and </li>
      <li>integrating environmental and resource management policies which take 
        into account<br>
        the effects on sustainable development of trade liberalization programmes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Promoting the role of civil society.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Establishing a single centralized political council which meets regularly, 
    and which is responsible for<br>
    environmental policy and governance. </li>
  <li>Promoting peace, democracy and human rights, and moving away from the position 
    in which Africa<br>
    is characterized by conflicts, political strife and human suffering (Expanded 
    Joint Secretariat 2001). </li>
</ul>
