<h3><a name="img2c2"></a>POLLUTION OF AFRICA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT 
</h3>
<p>Africa's coastal and marine ecosystems are under extreme pressure from pollution 
  from both land-based and marine-based sources. Among these are uncontrolled 
  discharges of industrial waste and sewage from coastal settlements, refuse blown 
  or washed out to sea from formal or informal rubbish dumps, general and toxic 
  wastes deliberately dumped at sea, and oil spills and leaks. Effluents from 
  fish processing plants and industries located in the coastal zone are frequently 
  discharged directly into the sea or into surrounding watercourses and wetlands, 
  from where contaminants are washed out to sea. This practice has been driven 
  by lack of affordable alternative disposal facilities, often because the rate 
  of industrial development in the coastal zone has outstripped rates of infrastructure 
  provision or because industries consider the tariffs for waste disposal to be 
  too high. Residues of fertilizers are also washed down in rivers and contribute 
  to eutrophication of coastal waters and the development of algal blooms and 
  toxic red tides.</p>
<p>In densely populated urban centres, domestic sewage is sometimes discharged 
  directly or indirectly into the sea. This is due to the pressures of tourism 
  and population growth and a demand for infrastructure in the coastal zone which 
  exceeds the capacity of local authorities to supply adequate sanitation and 
  treatment of wastes. Solid domestic waste can also be blown or washed out to 
  sea or onto beaches when waste collection, treatment and disposal services are 
  inadequate.</p>
<p>The impacts of coastal and marine pollution are widespread and affect natural 
  habitats, human communities and economic activities. For example, contamination 
  of shellfish through red tides, heavy metals in industrial effluents or accumulation 
  of toxic organic compounds can result in severe economic losses. Pollution of 
  coastal waters by sewage can expose local communities and tourists to cholera, 
  typhoid, and hepatitis. Solid waste washed up on the shore is unsightly and 
  a health hazard (especially sharp objects and toxic substances), and may have 
  a deterrent effect on tourists. At sea, solid waste, especially plastics, can 
  be mistaken for food items by dolphins, turtles, seals and sea birds. These 
  creatures are also at risk from entanglement and poisoning from solid wastes.</p>
<p>The waters around Africa are major transportation routes for oil and there 
  have been many serious accidents in recent years, including the break up of 
  the Apollo Sea in 1994, and the Treasure in 2000, both off the Cape of Good 
  Hope. Oil spills resulting from such accidents smother plants and animals and 
  break down thermal insulation in sea birds and mammals. Soluble organic compounds 
  from the spilled products get into the food web where they are toxic to wildlife 
  and can cause behavioural changes, physiological damage or reproductive failure. 
  Clean up and subsequent disposal of oily wastes is difficult and extremely expensive. 
  In response to this, national and regional oil spill contingency plans have 
  been established in many parts of Africa. However, it is not just oil spills 
  that are a problem. Oil tankers frequently empty ballast and wash engines on 
  the high seas and residues of degraded oil are consolidated and washed onto 
  the shores by wind, currents and waves, resulting in tar balls. Added to this 
  are leaks from oil drilling activities, port handling of oil and petroleum products 
  and refineries located in coastal zones, and leaks from barges, tankers, pleasure 
  craft and fishing boats.</p>
