<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Northern African countries account for a large proportion of all of Africa's 
  GHG emissions, although emissions are lower than those of most European or North 
  American countries. In 1996, Northern African countries emitted a total of 280 
  million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, 37 per cent of Africa's total (African 
  Development Bank 2001). The highest total emissions were from Algeria and Egypt, 
  although Libya had the highest per capita emissions of any country in Africa 
  (8 tonnes). Northern Africa is also responsible for about 20 per cent of Africa's 
  anthropogenic methane emissions (African Development Bank 2001).</p>
<p>Predicted impacts of climate change for Northern Africa include decreased run-off 
  water, increased desertification, and increased frequency of flooding and drought 
  (IPCC 1998). In the drylands, predominant throughout the sub-region, population 
  growth will push people into marginal lands which are highly vulnerable to desertification.</p>
<p>Management of changes in water resources resulting from climate change will 
  be very difficult, as the sub-region is already suffering from problems of water 
  availability and distribution. However, the most dramatic impacts will be seen 
  in the coastal zone as a result of sea level rise. For example, studies have 
  shown that a sizeable portion of the Nile Delta will be lost through inundation 
  and erosion, with consequent loss of agricultural production, damage to infrastructure, 
  and displacement of people. A one metre rise in sea level would inundate large 
  areas of land in the Nile Delta area, and the Egyptian city of Alexandria would 
  also be severely affected (see '<a href="094.htm">Coastal and marine environment</a>').</p>
<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>All countries in the Northern Africa sub-region are parties to the UNFCCC and, 
  by October 2001, Egypt had signed the Kyoto Protocol. Northern African countries 
  are investigating the application of stricter efficiency measures, improved 
  quality of fuels, and advances in the use of higher efficiency engines and industrial 
  plants to reduce emissions including GHGs (Unified Arab Economic Report 1999). 
  Improved energy efficiency, brought about through energypricing reforms and 
  technological adaptations, could also make a substantial contribution to curbing 
  of carbon dioxide emissions. Alternative sources of energy-such as solar energy 
  which is abundant in the region-are being explored, especially in the rural 
  areas that are home to about 50 per cent of the region's population. With international 
  assistance, solar power could increasingly become a commercially viable option 
  for many applications.</p>
<p>Northern African countries are also benefiting from Global Environment Facility 
  (GEF) funding for climate change mitigation. For example, Sudan has projects 
  for rangeland rehabilitation to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce GHG 
  emissions, and Tunisia has received funds for renewable energy development (GEF 
  1999).</p>
