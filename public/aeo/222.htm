<h1>CONCLUDING SUMMARY </h1>
<h2>ATMOSPHERE</h2>
<p>Africa is extremely vulnerable to climate variability and climate change. Climate 
  variability means the seasonal and annual variations in temperature and rainfall 
  and their distribution within and between countries. Climate change refers to 
  long-term changes in global weather patterns resulting from changes in the composition 
  of the atmosphere brought about by emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).</p>

<p>Africa's climate is characterized by considerable variability and by extreme 
  climatic events such as droughts, floods, and cyclones. These have particularly 
  serious consequences for Africa because of the difficulties experienced in the 
  region in predicting their occurrence and in mitigating their effects, and also 
  because many African countries lack the financial resources to make adequate 
  and timely recovery before the next climatic event. The countries of the Horn 
  of Africa and the Sahel are most prone to drought; those of Western and Central 
  Africa experience flooding periodically. Cyclones occur regularly in the islands 
  of the Western Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Climate change is likely to bring increased frequency and severity of flooding 
  and drought to those areas already experiencing variability in rainfall. Additional 
  concerns are increased risk of desertification in Northern Africa and on the 
  southern border of the Sahel, and reduced availability of freshwater in Southern 
  Africa, resulting in lowered food security and the spread of infectious diseases 
  (notably malaria) to new areas. The islands and low-lying coastal areas of Central 
  and Western Africa are most vulnerable to the sea level rise resulting from 
  climate change. Coral bleaching due to sea temperature rise is the biggest threat 
  to the Western Indian Ocean Islands and to the coasts of the countries of Eastern 
  Africa.</p>
<p>Africa's contribution to global GHG emissions is negligible, with the exception 
  of emissions from South Africa and the countries of Northern Africa, which together 
  account for the majority of the Africa region's GHG emissions. However, activities 
  such as deforestation, inappropriate coastal development, and poor land management 
  throughout Africa contribute to worsening of possible impacts of climate change 
  such as drought, desertification, flooding, and sea level rise.</p>
<p>Low air quality is also emerging as an issue in many African countries, particularly 
  the more urbanized and industrialized. In large cities, populations are at risk 
  from respiratory infections caused by emissions from industry and vehicles and-in 
  both urban and rural areas-from the use of wood, coal, oil, paraffin and other 
  such fuels used for domestic consumption, and creating unhealthy indoor conditions.</p>
<p>Urgent action is required to develop alternative, clean, and renewable sources 
  of energy for Africa to avoid increasing GHG emissions and to stem widespread 
  deforestation. The Kyoto Protocol makes provision for funding streams to facilitate 
  such development. <a href="#fig2s1">Figure 2s.1</a> shows the major issues relating 
  to atmosphere for Africa.</p>
