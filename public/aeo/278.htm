<p>In the Market Forces scenario, the predominant trend to emerge is one whereby 
  land is used in the most economically efficient way, especially in agriculture. 
  In the drive to develop an export-led market economy, more agricultural land-and 
  particularly the better quality land-is used for producing cash crops and agricultural 
  commodities. Such agricultural production increasingly falls under the control 
  of multinational companies, which have both financial resources and access to 
  overseas markets in order to make these ventures viable. Decisions about agricultural 
  production become increasingly determined by external forces. Agriculture becomes 
  more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of global markets, especially fluctuating 
  commodity prices.</p>

      <p>With more of the better quality agricultural land being devoted to export 
        agriculture, the growing numbers of rural poor will be forced to use more 
        marginal lands for subsistence agriculture. Thus, those lands that would 
        normally require substantial technological and other inputs in order to 
        ensure sustainable use end up being used by those who are least able to 
        supply the necessary inputs.</p>

<p>With more of the better quality agricultural land being devoted to export agriculture, 
  the growing numbers of rural poor will be forced to use more marginal lands 
  for subsistence agriculture. Thus, those lands that would normally require substantial 
  technological and other inputs in order to ensure sustainable use end up being 
  used by those who are least able to supply the necessary inputs. The use of 
  these lands is likely to be unsustainable unless efforts are made to provide 
  technological and other support. Without this, soil erosion and nutrient losses 
  are likely to occur, leading to a reduction in soil fertility, and an increase 
  in the siltation of rivers and dams.</p>
<p>The drive to increase the economic returns from land also leads to a diversification 
  of land uses. Many countries in Africa rely increasingly on the development 
  of tourism in order to acquire foreign currency and, therefore, land continues 
  to be set aside and maintained for tourism (or tourism is included in the multiple 
  land use developments). Pressures to offset carbon emissions by industrialized 
  countries through developing carbon sinks in non-industrialized countries, including 
  some in Africa, leads to increased investment in the protection of established 
  forest lands and the reforestation or afforestation of non-forested lands. This 
  displaces some traditional land use practices.</p>
<p>The prospect of employment also attracts increasing numbers of people to areas 
  of tourism development, resulting in concentrated population pressures in attractive 
  areas (that is, coastal resorts). For many immigrants, however, their lack of 
  skills limits opportunities. Consequently, many of them resort to hawking, manufacturing 
  crafts and curios, and other secondary activities. The oversupply of crafts 
  and curios drives down prices, increasing the bargains for tourists, but also 
  increasing their harassment, as hawkers become more relentless in their efforts 
  to sell their goods. This gradually diminishes the attractiveness of some tourist 
  locations.</p>
<p>With the growing economic activity, increasing numbers of people are drawn 
  to urban areas in search of employment. Again, opportunities are limited, because 
  the immigrants are generally unskilled and only qualify as manual labour. Because 
  more people arrive than can immediately find employment, particularly in better-paid 
  jobs, squatter settlements and hastily constructed high-density housing blocks 
  are created. Even in the wealthier suburbs and surrounding areas, the rate of 
  establishment of new houses and housing complexes overwhelms the capacity of 
  town and city planners to coordinate and integrate these developments, leading 
  to unplanned urbanization. The upgrading and expansion of infrastructure (roads, 
  power, water and sanitation) lags behind these developments.</p>
<p>Migration away from rural areas tends to relieve pressure on land resources 
  in some areas, but is more than offset by continued high population growth rates 
  in others. This continues the trend towards unsustainable use of natural resources 
  ,and increases the likelihood and extent of environmental degradation. Changes 
  in lifestyles also affect land use. Increasing demand for meat, particularly 
  among the more wealthy people in urban areas, encourages increased use of land 
  for grazing or, where livestock production is intensified, for fodder and feed 
  grain production.</p>
