<a name="img36"></a>Much of the rural poverty problem is characterized by the 
existence of: 
<ul>
  <li> increasing landlessness;</li>
  <li> a large number of farmers with very small holdings; </li>
  <li>a lack of resources to invest in agricultural improvement; </li>
  <li>the 'urban pull' effect; </li>
  <li>low levels of rural education; </li>
  <li>migration to urban areas of those who do achieve an acceptable level of 
    education; </li>
  <li>overvalued exchange rates, which discourage agricultural exports; and </li>
  <li>poverty amongst women.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rural poor are particularly vulnerable to stresses, such as extremes of 
  temperature and rainfall (climate variation which results in drought and floods), 
  general financial shortage, and persistent illness and bereavement. They are 
  even more vulnerable to shocks, including famine, floods, epidemics and major 
  changes in markets (Benneh and others, 1996). </p>
<p>About 40 per cent of the region's poor live in urban areas and, depending on 
  the countries and urban settlements, between 15 and 65 per cent of African urban 
  dwellers live in poverty, with little or absolutely no access to social and 
  urban services which constitute decent living conditions (Soumaré and Gérard 
  2000). Rapid rates of urbanization in Africa can be attributed to the effects 
  of colonialism, rural-to-urban migration, weak rural economies and a poor industrial 
  base which cannot absorb unskilled labour from rural areas. The result of rapid 
  urbanization is the radical transformation of the structure of cities, accompanied 
  by complex social, economic and environmental changes (Rabinovitch 1997). There 
  is strong evidence to suggest that urban environmental hazards-such as biological 
  pathogens and various pollutants-are a major cause of or contributor to urban 
  poverty and, for much of the urban poor population, environmental hazards are 
  the main causes of ill-health, injury and premature death (Satterthwaite 1999).</p>
<p>Poor people, especially in urban areas, often settle in fragile zones with 
  high population densities. This increases the overall impact of exposure to 
  risk under conditions of heightened vulnerability, as the case study in the 
  <a href="#box39">Box 3.9</a> illustrates.</p>

                <p>The Manchieyt Nasser township, located at the heart of Cairo, 
                  developed from a long-standing limestone quarry and dump site-activities 
                  which moulded the rugged contours of the site to what is it 
                  today. The township now represents the biggest informal squatter 
                  settlement in Egypt, with between 350 000 and 500 000 people 
                  living on a mountainous site of 7.27 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p>Most of these people are exposed, on a daily basis, to a plethora 
                  of natural and human-made environmental hazards. At the same 
                  time, they face the continuous possibility of legal charges 
                  for illegal occupation of state-owned land.Most of them lack 
                  the choice to reduce their economic and health vulnerability 
                  as a result of the environmental hazards.More shanty-town dwellers 
                  were moved into the area in 1960 and, in 1972, garbage deposition 
                  was relocated to the area.</p>
                <p>The infrastructure and social services in the township are 
                  scanty and inadequate-and some have become obsolete. The construction 
                  of dwellings on environmentally fragile and risky spots has 
                  been commonplace. Pollution in the area results from informal 
                  manufacturing activities, leaking raw sewage, the open burning 
                  of garbage and mounting heaps of solid wastes. The area has 
                  also become a refuge for outlaws and illegal practices, due 
                  to its virtual inaccessibility to security forces. These changes 
                  have only worsened an already bad environmental situation, rendering 
                  the inhabitants more and more vulnerable. Thus, the area was 
                  the most badly damaged by an earthquake which struck Cairo in 
                  October 1992. Today, a considerable number of inhabitants still 
                  live in very dangerous spots in the area.</p>
