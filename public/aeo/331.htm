<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>Africa's environment has deteriorated steadily, with poverty being the main 
  cause of that degradation, and with the poor being its direct victims. High 
  levels of poverty-in combination with increasing instances of climate variability 
  and natural disasters, internal institutional weaknesses in Africa, and unfair 
  trading practices in developed countries-have made Africans more vulnerable 
  physically, psychologically and economically. The collective African capacity 
  to cope with increasing vulnerability is also generally low.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude of these problems, it may appear as if African governments, 
  and sub-regional and regional organizations, are doing nothing to solve them. 
  This is not so. They have initiated steps to halt or even reverse environmental 
  degradation, although initiatives are now required for more effective implementation 
  of policies and strategies that have been adopted.</p>
<p>It is also significant that Africa has a vision for sustainable development 
  embodied in the newly formed African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's 
  Development. There is great optimism that Africa can catch up with the rest 
  of the world and even surpass it, using the Great Transitions scenario. However, 
  if this is to be achieved, African countries need, amongst other things, to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reduce poverty;</li>
  <li>improve the state of the environment;</li>
  <li>improve management systems;</li>
  <li>reduce vulnerability to adverse environmental changes;</li>
  <li>promote regional and sub-regional cooperation;</li>
  <li>mobilize additional financial resources; and</li>
  <li>create an effective institutional structure to holistically manage the environment 
    on a regionwide basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>African governments must show greater political will and commitment to solving 
  environmental problems, and must be prepared to devote their own financial and 
  human resources to practical environmental action. They must also address the 
  issue of corruption if they are to improve efficiency in utilization of resources, 
  and they must embrace the democratic process for better governance.</p>
<p>African national governments, sub-regional organizations, AMCEN and the international 
  community are encouraged to contribute to implementation of the specific activities 
  proposed in the 31 areas for action identified above. A key responsibility lies 
  with AMCEN, and with sub-regional groupings and national governments, to mobilize 
  adequate technical, human and financial resources for the implementation of 
  these activities. The international community is also urged to support the efforts 
  of the national governments, subregional organizations and AMCEN, in the spirit 
  of the New Partnership for Africa's Development.</p>
