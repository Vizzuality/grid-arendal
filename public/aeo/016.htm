<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</h3>
<p>Although the 1980s have been referred to as the 'lost decade' for Africa, it 
  was also the decade in which governments in the region consolidated efforts 
  to set their countries on a path of sustainable development. Various environmental 
  initiatives were undertaken during this period, at both regional and global 
  levels, and these greatly influenced environmental policy in Africa.</p>
<h4>Emergence of African common resolve</h4>
<p>Meetings under the auspices of the OAU, such as the 1980 Extraordinary Summit 
  of Heads of State and Government, which led to the adoption of the Lagos Plan 
  of Action, helped to highlight the challenges facing the region. Under the Lagos 
  Plan of Action, African leaders emphasized that 'Africa's huge resources must 
  be applied principally to meet the needs and purposes of its people.' They also 
  emphasized the need for Africa's apparent 'total reliance on the export of raw 
  materials' to change, and the need to mobilize its entire human and material 
  resources for the development of the region (OAU 1980). The Lagos Plan of Action 
  (see <a href="#tab14">Table 1.4</a>) is one of many measures adopted by the 
  region which set either qualitative or quantitative targets. Unfortunately, 
  many of these targets remain unmet.</p>

<h4>African Ministerial Conference on the Environment</h4>
<p>The first meeting of AMCEN, organized by UNEP in close collaboration with the 
  UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the OAU, was held in Cairo, Egypt 
  in December 1985. In addition to being Africa's direct response to the 1972 
  Stockholm Conference, the establishment of AMCEN was also part of UNEP's response 
  to Africa's environmental crisis. The objective of the AMCEN programme, which 
  was adopted in Cairo, is to mobilize national, sub-regional and regional cooperation 
  in four priority areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>halting environmental degradation;<br>
  </li>
  <li>enhancing Africa's food producing capacity;<br>
  </li>
  <li>achieving self-sufficiency in energy; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>correcting the imbalance between population and resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of its programme, AMCEN focuses on environmental, social and economic 
  inequality, and their impact on the environment. It also focuses on the pace 
  of economic globalization and its environmental impact on Africa. The AMCEN 
  meeting in Abuja in 2000 marked a turning point for AMCEN. At this meeting, 
  African governments committed themselves to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keeping a constant review of policy actions that would enable Africa to 
    address environmental<br>
    challenges, especially new and emerging issues; </li>
  <li>building capacity to deal with major concerns; </li>
  <li>forging strategic partnerships with the public and private sectors, with 
    civil society, with non-governmental<br>
    organizations (NGOs) and with the international community in preparing and<br>
  </li>
  <li>implementing AMCEN policies and programmes; </li>
  <li>coordinating the implementation of environmental treaties, in accordance 
    with environmental and development priorities; and </li>
  <li>cooperating with relevant regional and sub-regional bodies in preparing 
    a common position for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held 
    in Johannesburg in 2002.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through its partnership with UNEP, AMCEN has committed itself to keeping under 
  review the state of the environment, and emerging environmental issues and trends, 
  in Africa. It also aims to provide early warning signals, and to promote government 
  and public access to environmental information, as a basis for policy development, 
  programme responses and action to achieve environmental security.</p>
<p>For almost 20 years, AMCEN has facilitated the broadening of the political 
  and public policy legitimacy of environmental concerns, through the growth of 
  civil society organizations, and their active participation in international 
  and national environmental activities. Some of the milestones that AMCEN has 
  achieved include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the adoption in January 1991 of the Bamako Convention on Hazardous Wastes;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the adoption in Abidjan in November 1992 of the African Common Position, 
    which was subsequently<br>
    submitted to the UNCED Secretariat; </li>
  <li>the establishment and promotion of eight networks, in the areas of: environmental<br>
    monitoring; climatology; soils and fertilizers; energy; water resources; genetic 
    resources;<br>
    environmental education and training; and science and technology;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the establishment of four committees related to </li>
  <li>the development and improvement of the environment of the five African ecosystems,<br>
    namely: deserts and arid lands; rivers and lake basins; forests and woodlands; 
    regional seas; and<br>
    island ecosystems; </li>
  <li>the harmonization of Africa's position on global environmental issues, 
    through the Convention on<br>
    Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 
    (UNFCCC) and the<br>
    UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious 
    Drought and/or<br>
    Desertification, Particularly in Africa (UNCCD); and </li>
  <li>the strengthening of cooperation between African member states.</li>
</ul>
