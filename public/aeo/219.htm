<h4>Management of pollution and waste in Western Africa</h4>
<p>Waste disposal is one of the most pressing and most visible environmental issues 
  in cities in Western Africa, as elsewhere. Lack of investment in waste collection 
  and disposal facilities, lack of sufficient suitable landfill sites, and growing 
  volumes of waste resulting from increasing consumption, changes in packaging 
  and increasing urban populations have all contributed to a breakdown in solid 
  waste management. For example, in Accra it has been reported that, in 1992, 
  just 11 per cent of the 1.4 million inhabitants had waste collection facilities, 
  and the remainder of residents were dumping their refuse informally (Songsore 
  1992). In 1989, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, reported that none of its solid waste 
  went to sanitary landfill, 72 per cent was disposed of in open dumps, 15 per 
  cent was burned, and 3 per cent was recycled (UNCHS 2001c). During the same 
  year, the city of Dakar, Senegal, reported that all of its solid waste was disposed 
  of in open dumps (UNCHS 2001c). In Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital, an estimated 
  600-800 tonnes of household refuse are generated every day, of which 500 tonnes 
  are collected (UNCHS 2001c). This results in large amounts of waste being blown 
  onto streets and into drainage channels (where it causes blockages and creates 
  a risk of flooding), or being burned, giving off toxic fumes and thus threatening 
  human health.</p>
<p>Leachates from solid wastes can contaminate surface and groundwater sources, 
  adding to the problem of inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and 
  increasing the risk of disease transmission. Responses have included privatization 
  of waste collection, sorting, and disposal, in an attempt to improve coverage 
  and treatment. In Nouakchott, for example, private operators have been collecting 
  and transporting garbage since 1997. However, they are linked to the municipality 
  by contract, and thus still receive inadequate funding.</p>
<p>Reuse of organic waste in urban agriculture is an activity that is rapidly 
  gaining popularity as a means of waste management, and one that is changing 
  the perception of organic material-no longer seen as merely waste but as a useful 
  input to another process. A sizeable proportion of solid waste is organic (85 
  per cent in Accra, Ghana), consisting of food leftovers, vegetable matter, leaves, 
  fruit, and bones (Asomani- Boateng & Haight 1999), and urban agriculture is 
  widely practised as a means of supplementing incomes and food supply. The organic 
  compost or fertilizer from organic waste is a valuable addition. Despite this 
  seemingly win-win opportunity, municipal authorities appear reluctant to encourage 
  and commercialize this activity, as it would require changes to urban planning 
  and changes in attitudes towards urban agriculture (Asomani-Boateng & Haight 
  1999).</p>
<p>Air pollution is another issue of concern in urban areas of Western Africa, 
  arising mainly from vehicle and industrial emissions, and domestic use of coal, 
  oil, wood, or other 'dirty' fuels. Many vehicles in the cities of Western Africa, 
  as elsewhere in Africa, are old and still run on leaded fuel or diesel, and 
  have inefficient combustion. Compounding this is the rapid growth in urban populations, 
  which is now over-burdening the transport infrastructure and road networks, 
  and the high tariffs placed on importing new (and therefore more efficient) 
  vehicles. Congestion and air pollution are thus common in urban areas, and concerns 
  are being raised over the impacts on human health, in particular the incidence 
  of respiratory diseases. Dakar (Senegal) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) are 
  among the many Western African cities experiencing increased motorization rates. 
  Currently there are no air quality standards, and little has been done so far 
  to monitor pollution levels or their impacts on the environment or the health 
  of residents (World Bank 2001b). However, a World Bank approximation of air 
  pollution costs in Dakar and in Ouagadougou amounted to 2.7 per cent and 1.6 
  per cent of GDP respectively (World Bank 2001b). Policies in place to tackle 
  this problem include promotion of newer, less polluting vehicles and cleaner 
  fuels, reorganization of mass transit, traffic regulation and land use planning 
  in urban centres (World Bank 2001b). The World Bank also launched the Clean 
  Air Initiative in sub-Saharan African Cities, in 1998, to raise awareness of 
  the impacts of air pollution and to identify and implement strategies for improving 
  air quality. A conference held in November 2001, in Abuja, Nigeria, identified 
  options for phase out of leaded gasoline, and provided a framework for development 
  of action plans.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in Western Africa</h4>
<p>In addition to programmes by local authorities to improve water supply, sanitation, 
  and waste management, many municipalities in Western Africa have enacted legislation 
  to assist with improving urban planning and environmental management. The cities 
  of Cotonou, Parakou, Porto-Novo (Benin) Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Abidjan, 
  Yamoussoukro (Cote d'Ivoire), Banjul (Gambia), Accra, Kumasi (Ghana), Conakry 
  (Guinea), Monrovia (Liberia), Bamako (Mali), Nouakchott (Mauritania), Ibadan, 
  Lagos (Nigeria), Bignona, Thies (Senegal), Lomé and Sokode (Togo) have all developed, 
  institutionalized, and implemented local environmental plans (UNCHS 2001c). 
  Many of these and other West African countries also have national legislation 
  or National Environmental Action Plans. Sustained investment in urban upgrading 
  and development of infrastructure is a priority for Western African countries, 
  as for all African countries, in order to keep pace with the rates of urban 
  growth and to improve the living conditions of millions of urban residents.</p>
