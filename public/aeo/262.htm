<p><a name="fig41"></a>The African Environment Outlook (AEO) is an initiative 
  of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), with technical 
  support from the Division of Environment Assessment and Early Warning (DEAW) 
  of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). AMCEN was established in 
  1985 as an environmental intergovernmental body in Africa, with a mandate to 
  provide policy guidance, and to identify priorities for the implementation of 
  environmental treaties and goals at national and sub regional levels. One of 
  AMCEN's goals is to ensure that the quality of the environment is maintained, 
  and that Africans derive quality of life through the environment's provision 
  of food, shelter and natural resources, which are needed to generate employment 
  (AMCEN 1987, 1989,1993). AMCEN has made considerable progress in imparting environmental 
  awareness to African governments. It has also facilitated the establishment 
  of ministries of environment in many countries, as well as the enactment of 
  environmental acts and bills which are being implemented in many countries.</p>
<p>AMCEN's eighth session, held in Abuja, Nigeria in April 2000, marked a turning 
  point for the organization as the conference adopted a medium-term programme 
  which clearly spelled out the need to provide an AEO. An AEO was identified 
  as one of the tools which could be used to respond to Africa's persistent and 
  severe economic and environmental problems in a sustainable way. It will provide 
  the opportunity for AMCEN to look into the future, and to assess the various 
  environmental and sustainable development policy options for the next 30 years, 
  and then to identify which steps can meaningfully be taken at national, sub-regional 
  and regional levels. Such a task involves a clear conceptualization of what 
  the future environment should be like. It also requires great vision to create 
  these possible future scenarios, to outline their characteristics and to show 
  in what areas preferences lie.</p>
<p>Few scenarios have been developed to evaluate the environmental sustainability 
  of Africa as a whole. However, many scenarios have been devised at subregional 
  levels, which provide some general perspectives regarding the future of the 
  region. Recent reviews by <i>GEO-2</i> (UNEP 2000) and Raskin (2000 a) describe 
  attempts to develop scenarios for different sub-regions of Africa by: the International 
  Institute for Environment and Development (IIED 1997); the World Bank (WB 1996); 
  the Southern African Research and Documentation Centre (SARDC 1994); <i>Club 
  du Sahel </i>(OECD 1995); <i>Beyond Hunger Study </i>(Achebe and others, 1990); 
  and <i>Blue Plan </i>(UNEP 1989). <a href="#fig41">Figure 4.1</a> outlines these 
  scenarios. In general, these scenarios provide perspectives with timescales 
  ranging from 18 years (IIED) to almost 70 years (<i>Beyond Hunger</i>).</p>
<p>At least two contrasting scenarios were proposed for each region by most of 
  the review bodies. For example, the IIED proposed 'Doomsday' and 'Sustainable 
  Future' scenarios. The WB proposed 'Current Trends' and 'Desired Future' scenarios, 
  for environmentally sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa. Club du Sahel 
  proposed '<i>Laissez-faire</i>', 'Orthodox Growth' and 'Regional Integration' 
  scenarios. <i>Beyond Hunger </i>proposed 'Conventional Wisdom' and 'Big Lift' 
  scenarios. <i>Blue Plan </i>proposed 'Trend Scenarios' and 'Alternative Scenarios'. 
  In almost all cases, comparisons were made between pairs of scenarios.</p>
<p>The 'business as usual' scenario, which comprises scenarios such as '<i>Laissez-faire</i>', 
  'Orthodox Growth' and 'Current Trends', is driven by demographic change, particularly 
  population growth and migration, and by lacklustre economic development. The 
  'Doomsday' scenario provides the worst-case scenario, given a <i>laissez-faire</i> 
  approach to environmental change. Some scenarios, such as the 'Current Trends' 
  scenario and UNEP's <i>Blue Plan</i>, look at realistic futures for specific 
  sub-regions of Africa, and <i>Blue Plan</i> attempts to chart a desirable course 
  for African development. There are also discussions on alternative scenarios, 
  which feature a desirable and sustainable vision for the region.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most positive of the scenarios is <i>Beyond Hunger</i> (Achebe 
  and others, 1990). This provides a vision of Africa some 100 years after the 
  independence of Ghana, which was the first colonial territory in Africa to become 
  independent in 1957. <i>Beyond Hunger</i>, produced before South Africa imbibed 
  multiracial politics in 1994, already envisioned an African state of Azania 
  for South Africa. It also envisioned the institution of mechanisms that would 
  lead Africa to an economic development strategy which emphasized autonomy or 
  integration into global markets. <i>Beyond Hunger </i>can be said to constitute 
  the roots of the 'African Renaissance'- the resurgence of African culture, human 
  resource development, outreach programmes and public participation in the development 
  process.</p>
