<h3>THE SCENARIOS</h3>
<p>We can draw some general conclusions from the scenarios about the state of 
  the environment not only in Africa as a region, but also in its sub-regions. 
  Some of these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While some climatic change may be inevitable in Africa, the scenarios will 
    differ mainly in the ability of different sub-regions to put into operation 
    adequate strategies for coping with these consequences. African countries 
    are very vulnerable to all forms of hazards and disasters.</li>
  <li>Tourism of all kinds may become a major force, promoting environmental change. 
    However, the effects of tourism could be either positive or negative, depending 
    on how its development is handled, as well as how equitably the benefits of 
    tourism are shared.</li>
  <li>The land issue remains critical, as the need to ensure effective and acceptable 
    land reform becomes crucial not only for rural areas, but also for urban land 
    development.</li>
  <li>Water pollution is likely to emerge as a serious problem, in addition to 
    water inadequacies in some regions. Consequently, controlling water pollution 
    could have numerous advantages and benefits. For instance, limiting water 
    pollution could offer opportunities for cost-sharing, as different groups 
    might benefit.</li>
  <li>Associated with the land issue are the issues of deforestation and desertification, 
    which have already become major problems in many parts of the region. Compounded 
    by sourcing fuels through tree cutting and wood burning, the state of the 
    environment remains one to be watched most carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the scenarios described in this work all have one thing in common. 
  They are forms of peeping into the future from a current situation: the state 
  of the environment. In other words, they are humanity's attempts to conceive 
  the future for the purpose of evolving a society which benefits humankind, not 
  only in our present circumstances, but also in all future endeavours. For this 
  reason, the scenarios are greatly influenced by our current situation, and by 
  the operating driving forces of the world economic system. In the context of 
  Africa, the major driving forces are globalization and the unsustainable level 
  of the world environment system. While these represent major uncertainties, 
  as we progress through the new millennium, they remain important considerations 
  in the way in which they impact the environment at global, regional, subregional, 
  national and local levels.</p>

<a name="fig413"></a>The Market Forces scenario is predicated on the assumption 
that existing strong linkages with international financial institutions, multinational 
corporations and global markets will continue to drive the world economic system 
which, in turn, will impact the African regional environmental system with its 
catalogue of goods and bads. Furthermore, there will be effective mechanisms through 
which environmental bads are processed and converted into forms that ensure the 
sustainability of the African environment. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, 
this assumption has become more theoretical than practical, both in its interpretation 
of the development process and in its attempts to order the impacts on the environment. 
In the African situation, market forces have brought more socioeconomic problems 
than were experienced in earlier decades, and people have neglected to consider 
the negative impacts of their activities on the environment. The peculiar position 
of Africa as the backwater of the advanced countries, coupled with the almost 
obliterating levels of poverty in the region, make consideration of environmental 
sustainability secondary. Market forces, consisting of economic principles of 
development, have always played themselves out to the detriment of African people. 
Africa and Africans continue to remain vulnerable to unrestrained economic exploitation 
of resources, and this trend leads not only to unsustainable patterns of living, 
but also to unsustainable assaults on the environment (see <a href="#fig413">Figure 
4.13</a>). 
<p>The Policy Reform scenario is a natural reaction towards seeking a balance 
  between socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability. Current 
  threats to the environment-as seen in rising levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the 
  air; the inability to manage all forms of solid and liquid waste, especially 
  in the cities; the continued destruction of forests and biodiversity; and the 
  decreasing levels of environmental health-are indications of the inability of 
  market forces to order reactions to environmental sustainability. The Policy 
  Reform scenario, therefore, proposes to achieve a balance in sustainable economic 
  and social development while, at the same time, respecting many environmental 
  issues. Under these conditions, targets are set by regional organizations, such 
  as the OAU and AMCEN, and serious efforts are made to adopt Multilateral Environmental 
  Agreements (MEAs) and protocols, and to make these operational. We are all witness 
  to the fact that the ratification of these treaties is a far cry form their 
  actualization in individual countries. Consequently, the problem remains of 
  managing the environment in a sustainable manner through the mechanism of MEAs 
  and policies (see <a href="#fig413">Figure 4.13</a>).</p>
<p>A major problem of the Policy Reform scenario lies in its inability to go all 
  the way in outlining requirements for sustainable social and environmental development, 
  partly because of the strong interplay of market forces in the scenario. There 
  are also other political and national considerations in the implementation of 
  MEAs. Furthermore, the danger also remains that inadequate and inappropriate 
  attention to environmental issues, in the short term and in the long term, may 
  lead to the breakdown of law and order. Many of the current tensions and disturbances 
  in Africa may be traced to one form or other of the numerous environmental pressures 
  in the region.</p>
<p>Of course, the movement to a Fortress World scenario is much closer than is 
  usually envisaged. Wealth is distributed in a lopsided manner-between people, 
  between urban and rural areas, and between regions-and it is difficult to introduce 
  policies that can reasonable alter these distributions of wealth. Within any 
  of these units, there are enough tensions to lead to a breakdown of law and 
  order. And so the wealthy have already learned how to protect themselves. The 
  crime levels in cities, and the fact that these are perpetuated openly, are 
  indicative of a gradual breakdown of law and order, which could be a reaction 
  against the society and those who manage it. It is, as yet, an unorganized reaction, 
  but it is already a dangerous trend. Coupled with other forms of tensions-such 
  as those which could arise from religion, and from political alliances which 
  the wealthy have managed to exploit for selfish reasons-a Fortress World scenario 
  is very much just around the corner.</p>
