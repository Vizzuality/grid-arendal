<h2><a name="fig12"></a>THE 1990S TO 2002- TOWARDS REVITALIZATION</h2>
<p>Following global trends, significant and positive achievements, including political 
  liberalization, spread across Africa during the 1990s. Pluralism and accountability 
  were more evident than ever before. One-party dictatorships and military regimes 
  were swept out of power, as Africans exercised their right to elect their governments. 
  Leaders who accepted the will of the people at the ballot box began to emerge. 
  In most countries in the region, civil society grew in strength, with significant 
  movements towards decentralization, and with popular participation in the development 
  process.</p>
<h3>POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS</h3>
<p>The 1990s saw a further shift in the development paradigm for Africa. The 'real 
  issue' for the 1990s centred on good governance. One of the major political 
  events of the last decade of the 20th century was the abolition of apartheid 
  in South Africa. The photograph of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison 
  in February 1990 perhaps best represents the most lasting icon not only of the 
  decade, but also of decolonization. The first democratic elections in the country 
  in 1994, which elected Mandela into power as the first black South African president, 
  essentially marked the end of the decolonization process for Africa, even though 
  many hotspots continue to exist in the region.</p>
<p>During the period 1992-2002, the OAU also recognized the importance of cooperation 
  in environmental management. It established broad-based agreements, such as 
  Articles 56-59 of the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community, which 
  relate to: natural resources; energy; the environment; and the control of hazardous 
  wastes (UNEP 1999). The OAU and many governments in Africa have adopted instruments 
  or national constitutions which recognize the environment as a fundamental right. 
  This is, perhaps, a direct achievement of the 1972 Stockholm Conference, which 
  articulated, in Principle 1, the right of people to live 'in an environment 
  of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being'.</p>
<h3>REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS</h3>
<p>A number of regional and sub-regional institutions have been established in 
  Africa during the 1990s, in order to introduce and to strengthen sustainable 
  development programmes. Some of the institutions and initiatives are highlighted 
  in the following paragraphs.</p>
<h4>African Economic Community</h4>
<p>Efforts to strengthen regional cooperation in the sustainable use and management 
  of natural resources and the environment have never been more inclusive and 
  holistic than is provided for under the Treaty Establishing the African Economic 
  Community, adopted by OAU member states in Abuja in June 1991. The Tr eaty aims 
  at ensuring the harmonization and coordination of environmental protection policies 
  among member states. The objectives of the African Economic Community (AEC), 
  which was launched in Harare in 1997, are to promote economic, social and cultural 
  development, and the integration of African economies, in order to increase 
  economic self-reliance and to promote self-sustained development. Specifically, 
  the Abuja Treaty obliges parties to:</p>
