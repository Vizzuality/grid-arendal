<p>In addition to national forestry policy and institutional reform, international, 
  sub-regional and national efforts are being made to conserve forest resources 
  and reduce the pressures on forest ecosystems. Reforestation programmes are 
  being implemented through funding arrangements under the Kyoto Protocol, such 
  as the rehabilitation of degraded areas of the forests of Mount Elgon National 
  Park and Kibale National Park (Uganda), implemented jointly by the Ugandan government 
  and a Dutch energy utility consortium (NEMA 1999). As a response to the rising 
  demand for fuelwood, rural electrification is being promoted in some countries 
  such as Uganda. However, the rural poor cannot afford the investments needed 
  for electrical appliances or the electricity tariffs. Alternative means of meeting 
  the energy requirements include promoting the establishment of woodlots. The 
  success of these efforts will depend largely on improvements in land tenure 
  arrangements together with the realization that available arable land is in 
  short supply. Agroforestry techniques are being successfully introduced to help 
  boost agricultural productivity and economic gain. These have been taken up 
  by many Kenyan farmers and multipurpose tree species are now providing plant 
  nutrients, animal fodder, building poles, fuelwood and timber. Unfortunately, 
  for a variety of reasons including inadequacy of institutional capacity and 
  lack of funds, not all areas are being covered. Efforts are also underway to 
  improve the sustainability of the wood carving industry, by discouraging use 
  of endangered species while protecting the livelihoods of millions of entrepreneurs 
  (see <a href="#box2d5">Box 2d.5</a>).</p>

            <p>Kenya's extensive and successful wood carving industry is contributing 
              to deforestation and degradation of wooded areas through selective 
              harvesting. The four most commonly used species are Dalbergia melanoxylon, 
              Brachylaena huillensis, Combretum schumannii and Olea africana. 
              Carvers are aware of the threat this causes to the environment and 
              their livelihoods and have identified fast-growing, widely grown 
              tree species such as neem, jacaranda, grevillea and mango as alternatives. 
              These species can be harvested without environmental damage, and 
              their use for carving generates additional incomes to farmers who 
              grow them for fruit or other purposes. However, these species require 
              curing before carving, and carvers require some incentive to change 
              their current practices. The WWF has launched a campaign to raise 
              consumer awareness and encourage tourists and local residents to 
              buy carvings from sustainably produced woods. Certification is being 
              explored as an option to facilitate the switch, sustaining the livelihoods 
              of the carvers and helping to conserve the environment.</p>

<p>In addition to reviewing policy, legal status and regulations, some countries 
  in the sub-region have drawn up, or are currently drawing up, Forest Action 
  Plans or Programmes as the main frameworks for rehabilitation and expansion 
  of forest cover. Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda have 
  established criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management through 
  the Dry Zone Africa process, and Ethiopia and Kenya now have some of their forested 
  land under management plans. Burundi and Rwanda do not have such management 
  measures in place as yet (because wars and civil unrest have presented barriers 
  to these activities). However, both countries have large percentages of forest 
  in protected areas (30 per cent and 76 per cent respectively) (FAO 2001a). The 
  needs of some Kenyan communities for fuelwood, poles, sawnwood, wood-based panels, 
  and pulp and paper have been met largely through afforestation and reforestation 
  efforts at household and industrial/commercial levels. Rwanda has the largest 
  network of forest plantations in the sub-region and these help to meet some 
  of the timber needs of the local population.</p>
