<a name="img2e6"></a>Freshwater quality in parts of central Africa is declining, 
as a result of: pollution from industrial and sewage outflows; agricultural run-off; 
and saltwater intrusion. The Congo River has been recognized as one of the cleanest 
in the world, due to the absence of industry, large urban settlements and agriculture 
along its banks (Johnson 1999). However, coastal areas are experiencing run-off 
and effluent from neighbouring agro-plantations and industries, which contaminate 
rivers, marshes and groundwater reserves. Clear felling in the hinterland also 
contributes to high rates of soil erosion, and to the siltation of rivers and 
estuaries. In particular, the Lobe and Kienke rivers (Cameroon) are especially 
high in sediment, which is deposited in the coastal zone and prevents the development 
of reefbuilding coral (World Bank 2000). Salinization occurs where freshwater 
sources come into contact with brackish or saltwater. The coastal industrial town 
of Douala in Cameroon has problems with the salinization of drinking water from 
aquifer resources, because rising sea levels facilitate permeation of underground 
aquifers by seawater. There is also inadequate provision of sanitation for the 
city's 1.4 million inhabitants, and raised nutrient levels are recorded in the 
estuary, as result of sewage discharge (Gabche and Smith 2001). Coastal freshwater 
resources are further threatened by sea level rise, which the IPCC predicts could 
be as much as one metre by 2100 (IPCC 2001). 
<p>The impacts of declining water quality are both ecological and social, with 
  the contamination of freshwater habitat resulting in: losses of biodiversity; 
  regulation of water flow; and reduced availability of exploitatable water for 
  domestic, industrial, agricultural and recreational functions. There are also 
  heightened risks of waterborne diseases associated with lack of potable water 
  and sanitation, and costs of water treatment are increasing at a time when investment 
  in this sector is already inadequate. For example, the drinking water supply 
  in Yaounde, Cameroon, experiences occasional shortages and interruptions, driving 
  many people to fetch water from alternative sources, such as springs and wells. 
  A recent study of the bacteriological status of fifteen of these wells and springs 
  revealed high densities of faecal bacteria and, thus, high risk of disease (Nola, 
  Njine, Monkiedje, Sikati, Foko, Djuikom and Tailliez 1998). Several wetlands 
  in the region have been degraded, due to the construction of dams and irrigation 
  schemes, which divert water, and thus alter hydrological regimes. The reduction 
  in water flow, and the increased silt and nutrient levels from agricultural 
  return flows, have resulted in loss of favourable habitat and breeding grounds, 
  and several wetland species have been lost.</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in Central Africa</h4>
<p>In response to pressures affecting water quality, many programmes and actions 
  are under way in central Africa. These include: schemes for the drainage, purification 
  and decontamination of freshwater systems; water management programmes; public 
  awareness campaigns; ratification of relevant regional and transfrontier conventions 
  for water resources protection and management; and efforts to implement water 
  quality standards and control. National and international organizations have 
  been instrumental in water supply and sanitation projects at the local level, 
  and vehicles for international cooperation have been established for management 
  of shared water resources. The Gulf of Guinea Large Ecosystem Project, for example, 
  includes the management of land-based activities which contribute to declining 
  water quality. The GEF-funded Reversal of Land and Water Degradation project 
  has been initiated through the WB, in order to improve the management of resources 
  in the Lake Chad basin. Gabon now has three Ramsar sites, following ratification 
  of the Ramsar Convention in 1987 (Ramsar 2001), and Cameroon is undertaking 
  the rehabilitation of wetlands that were compromised due to inappropriate development 
  policies (see <a href="#box2e10">Box 2e.10</a>).</p>

            <p>Each year, the Logone River (Cameroon) floods an area of about 
              6 000 km<sup>2</sup>. This wetland supports large herds of giraffe, 
              elephant, lions and various ungulates (including topi, antelope, 
              reedbuck, gazelle and kob). Part of the floodplain has been designated 
              as the Waza National Park, which attracts thousands of tourists 
              per year, and which serves as a fish nursery in the flood season. 
              Livestock grazing is also an important activity, supporting the 
              livelihoods of many local communities. However, the wetland has 
              been significantly reduced in size since the construction of a barrage 
              across the floodplain in 1979.</p>
            <p>This barrage created Lake Maga, which supplies water for the irrigation 
              of nearby farmland. Fish stocks fell by 90 per cent, and grazing 
              potential has decreased, impacting on local livelihoods. Plans to 
              rehabilitate the wetland were established in 1993, and the embankments 
              along the river were modified at an estimated cost of US$5 million 
              over eight years. Stakeholders and local community members were 
              involved in the planning and design of the project, which reinundated 
              several thousand hectares of land. Small-scale fishing activities 
              have recommenced, and clean water has been supplied to 33 villages 
              from 37 wells. Together with training in health and sanitation, 
              this has succeeded in lowering the incidence of diarrhoea by 70 
              per cent.</p>

<p>Between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of the population with access to potable 
  water supply increased from 52 per cent to 62 per cent in Cameroon, and from 
  59 per cent to 60 per cent in Central African Republic (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Access 
  to sanitation has shown very slight increases, and rates are still far below 
  other countries in Africa. Continued increased investment in this area is required, 
  in order to mitigate pollution and the outbreak of diseases arising from inadequate 
  sanitation and wastewater treatment.</p>
