<h4><a name="img2e7"></a>Improving availability and access to freshwater resources 
  in Western Africa</h4>
<p>IWRM is recognized as a priority for western Africa. However, its implementation 
  has been constrained by a number of factors. The main obstacles are limited 
  technical skills in the sub-region, coupled with the complexity of the integrated 
  approach. In addition, the increasing demand for water, freshwater pollution 
  and disruptions to the hydrological cycle have complicated water resources management. 
  The deterioration of most of the infrastructure for hydrometeorological and 
  hydrogeological data collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination, as 
  well as lack of funding, have led to poor maintenance. This situation is aggravated 
  by political instability, due largely to armed conflicts, ethnic strife and 
  inadequate grassroots participation in decision making. However some countries 
  have adopted strategies on IWRM and development, or have enacted water laws 
  and established institutions to enforce the laws. Economic incentives for water 
  demand management have been successfully implemented in some areas, for example, 
  Conakry, Guinea (see <a href="#box2e11">Box 2e.11</a>). </p>
<p>A recent project to improve water supply to 90 villages in Mauritania has demonstrated 
  the importance of the involvement of community members in the design, establishment 
  and maintenance of facilities. This UNDP-funded programme created a private 
  network for the construction and maintenance of water supply equipment, providing 
  employment to the community, and ensuring back-up supplies of spare parts. A 
  water-point committee was also established in each village, in order to take 
  responsibility for management and maintenance costs, and local people were trained 
  to repair the equipment. On completion of the project, more than 90 per cent 
  of the villages were independently funding the maintenance of their pumps, with 
  help from the people trained during the project (UNDESA 2000).</p>
<p>There is also a growing tendency in the countries of Western Africa to intensify 
  monitoring, assessment and policy reform for the water resources sector. New 
  measures are being introduced for water conservation and the development of 
  infrastructure, in order to improve the integration of water and land management. 
  Furthermore, during the past three decades, numerous intergovernmental organizations 
  responsible for the development and management of shared rivers in the region 
  have emerged (in particular, for the management of the Senegal, Gambia and Niger 
  rivers), although their actual performance remains far below their potential.</p>

              was unaccounted for, and only 10 per cent of water bills were collected. 
              Since a private company took over the management of water services 
              in the city in 1989, water losses have been halved, and 85 per cent 
              of bills are now paid. In Lomé (Togo), the public water utility 
              has recently undergone improvements. Losses are now only 20 per 
              cent, almost all water bills are paid and water subsidies are not 
              required.</p>
