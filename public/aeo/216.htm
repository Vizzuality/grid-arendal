<h2>CENTRAL AFRICA</h2>
<p>The average level of urbanization in Central Africa in 2000 was 48 per cent, 
  ranging from 81 per cent in Gabon to 24 per cent in Chad (UNCHS 2001a). This 
  represents rapid growth, over the last decade in particular, with urbanization 
  rates of over three per cent for all countries, and reaching five per cent or 
  more in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. However, urbanization rates were even higher 
  during the previous decade, when economic growth encouraged employment in urban 
  areas. The largest cities in Central Africa are Kinshasa (5 million) in Democratic 
  Republic of Congo (DRC) and Douala (1.6 million) and Yaoundé (1.4 million) in 
  Cameroon (UNCHS 2001a).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>Central Africa has a long history of urbanization. Cities or urban centres 
  started as commercial, administrative and mining towns and as seaports during 
  the colonial period. As a result many major or capital cities are on the coast 
  (including Libreville and Douala) where access to trade, travel and international 
  communications is enhanced. Libreville is the economic and administrative capital 
  of Gabon, concentrating 50 per cent of the population, 50 per cent of employment, 
  and more than 80 per cent of GDP. Douala is Cameroon's most important city and 
  the man industrial centre. It is a port city with industries such as aluminium 
  smelting, brewing, textiles manufacture, and processing of wood and cocoa. Kinshasa 
  is also a port, on the Congo River estuary, and serves as the political, administrative, 
  and industrial capital of DRC (UNCHS 2001c). Although cities have become the 
  main catalysts of economic growth in Central Africa, urbanization has caused 
  massive problems of poverty and environmental degradation.</p>
<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>Environmental consequences of the rapid urbanization and urban population growth 
  include intensifying pressures on natural habitats and resources to satisfy 
  the growing demand for space, housing, and water for drinking and sanitation. 
  Municipalities and utility companies are unable to provide housing and infrastructure 
  quickly enough to meet this demand and sub-optimal services are therefore provided, 
  with suboptimal environmental standards and conditions.</p>
<p>Dualism between customary and modern tenure laws is also apparent in the urban 
  centres and, together with high land and property prices, is one of the causes 
  of unplanned or illegal construction. Rapid development of informal settlements 
  or shantytowns ensues, characterized by overcrowding, unstable or unhealthy 
  housing, inadequate water supply and sanitation, and lack of electricity supply 
  and waste collection.</p>
<h4>Unplanned settlements in Central Africa</h4>
<p>In Yaoundé, Cameroon, the majority of urban residents are squatters or tenants. 
  There are conflicting pressures on residents to purchase properties and rents 
  are high. However, property prices have also risen recently, while incomes have 
  declined because of devaluation of the currency (UNCHS 2001c). By contrast, 
  land prices in Douala are lower, and there is a much higher proportion of house 
  owners and no squatter settlements (UNCHS 2001c). In the DRC, security of tenure 
  is also complicated by disparities between modern legislation and traditional 
  laws. For example, the DRC's 1973 Land Act stipulated that 'land is the exclusive 
  inalienable and unprescriptable property of the state', but the acquisition 
  of land remains subject to the consent of the land chief.</p>
<p>The city of Libreville, Gabon, is experiencing uncontrolled urban development 
  resulting from a shortage of serviced plots, an absence of planning tools and 
  instruments, and a lack of urban space control. The demand for housing stands 
  at approximately 6 000 units per year (in a city with a population of 500 000), 
  and available land for development is minimal (there are 14 hectares of 'green 
  spaces' per 10 000 hectares) (UNCHS 2001c). The results are that over half of 
  the population lacks proper housing; there is rapid development of unplanned, 
  inadequately serviced, and often unsafe settlements; and illegal occupation 
  is as high as 85 per cent (UNCHS 2001c).</p>
<p>One of the most important environmental impacts of uncontrolled urbanization 
  in Central Africa is its spread into fragile ecosystems, including delicate 
  or highly erodible slopes, natural drainage waterways or valleys, and areas 
  that are subject to flooding. Due to the intense competition for space in urban 
  areas, green spaces are rapidly disappearing and areas usually deemed unsuitable 
  for housing are the only refuges available for the urban poor, who are then 
  vulnerable to flooding, landslides, and outbreaks of pests and diseases. Although 
  planning regulations are in place, they are poorly monitored and enforced. Development 
  in and modification of green areas results in changes to biodiversity, risks 
  of pollution of soil and water, changes to soil fertility and stability and, 
  especially in wetland areas or areas where there is standing water due to lack 
  of sanitation, high risk of disease transmission. Dense, unstable, and poorly 
  sited settlements are also vulnerable to the impacts of floods, landslides, 
  and fires.</p>
<p>Water supply and sanitation provision has also fallen behind rates of urban 
  growth in many Central African cities, largely due to lack of municipal funds 
  and capacities. On average, 59 per cent of the urban population has access to 
  clean water (over 80 per cent in Cameroon and DRC), whilst 54 per cent has access 
  to sanitation (but only 14 per cent in Congo and 25 per cent in Gabon) (WHO/UNICEF 
  2000). Inadequate water supply and sanitation pose a threat to human health 
  via exposure to pathogens such as cholera and intestinal parasites. They also 
  pose a threat to the surrounding environment if sewage and wastewater are discharged 
  untreated. Untreated discharges contaminate soil and water bodies, creating 
  a risk to human health via transmission of disease vectors or toxic elements, 
  and threaten biodiversity through effects on the ecosystem such as eutrophication 
  and contamination with heavy metals and inorganic compounds.</p>
