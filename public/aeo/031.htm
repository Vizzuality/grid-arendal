<h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
<h4>THE STATE OF AFRICA'S ENVIRONMENT AND POLICY ANALYSIS </h4>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The material presented here constitutes the first comprehensive, integrated 
  report on the state of the environment in Africa. Following on from the review 
  and assessment of development policies and progress described in Chapter 1, 
  attention is now turned to the environmental context that underlies policy and 
  forms the background for progress.</p>
<p>Improved understanding of the causes, patterns and consequences of environmental 
  change can contribute to more effective design and implementation of mechanisms 
  to tackle the negative impacts of such change. This report helps to improve 
  understanding by presenting detailed retrospective analyses of Africa's environment, 
  and by describing discernible environmental trends against the backdrop of human 
  activities and management practices of the past 30 years. It thus provides a 
  basis for learning from past experience and lays the groundwork for more effective 
  implementation of Agenda 21 and for sustainable development of Africa's environmental, 
  social and economic resources.</p>
<p>The framework used to assess the state of Africa's environment is called a 
  'Pressure-State-Impact- Response' framework:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'Pressures' are the root causes of environmental change (natural or resulting 
    from human activities).</li>
  <li>'State' reflects the current situation (and qualitative or quantitative 
    trends over the past 30 years).</li>
  <li>'Impacts' are the consequences of environmental change on human and ecological 
    systems, and on social and economic development potential.</li>
  <li>'Responses' include regional agreements and strategies for cooperation, 
    national policies, awareness and education programmes, and community-level 
    projects, aimed at addressing both the causes and impacts of environmental 
    change.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pressures, State, Impacts and Responses framework allows analysis of policies 
  and activities relating to specific environmental issues, reveals positive and 
  negative impacts of economic and development policies on the environment, and 
  shows how consideration of the environment can drive policy. Examples and case 
  studies are used to highlight particular issues of concern and instances of 
  good practice, and to illustrate the links between environmental components 
  and issues. Pressures, states, impacts, and responses are discussed in an integrated 
  manner for each issue.</p>
<p>It is not possible to cover all of the environmental issues that have arisen 
  over the past 30 years. Rather, this Chapter aims to draw attention to priority 
  issues for Africa as identified through regional and sub-regional consultations. 
  Hot spots of environmental degradation and potential and emerging issues are 
  highlighted where relevant. The 'bottom-up' means of assessment- in which information 
  comes from national or subnational activities and is synthesized in sub-regional 
  or regional analyses-and the extensive consultation and review processes ensure 
  that a wide range of perspectives and studies are incorporated, and that the 
  review of the state of the environment is as balanced and objective as possible.</p>
<p>The information is presented under seven environmental themes, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atmosphere</li>
  <li>Biodiversity</li>
  <li>Coastal and Marine Environments</li>
  <li>Forests</li>
  <li>Freshwater</li>
  <li>Land</li>
  <li>Urban Areas</li>
</ul>
<p>Key issues identified for each theme are introduced and regional perspectives 
  presented. Further details are then given for each sub-region. The cross-cutting 
  nature of environmental issues is emphasized at every opportunity with links 
  between issues, themes, subregions and causes or impacts of change being highlighted. 
  After this sub-regional analysis, the chapter ends with a <i>Concluding Summary</i> 
  which ties together the different themes at regional level and examines both 
  present and future priorities for action.</p>
<p>The breakdown of Africa into sub-regions presented in Chapter 1 is along political 
  and economic lines, its borders do not therefore always coincide with those 
  of an ecological breakdown. There is, therefore, some overlap in the sub-regional 
  analyses presented below.</p>
