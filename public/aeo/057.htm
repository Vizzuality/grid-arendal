<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The pressures resulting in climate variability and climate change originate 
  outside of Western Africa, given that the sub-region contributes little to global 
  emissions of carbon dioxide and other GHGs. Nigeria is the largest contributor 
  in the sub-region accounting for 11 per cent of Africa's total emissions in 
  1996 (African Development Bank 2001). Gas flaring in Nigeria consumes large 
  amounts of natural gas every day during oil extraction. This not only contributes 
  to atmospheric pollution by releasing considerable quantities of carbon dioxide, 
  but also wastes important resources. The Nigerian gas reserves are estimated 
  to be sufficient to provide power to the whole of Western Africa (United Nations 
  1999). Overall, however, it is the transport sector which contributes the most 
  to carbon emissions in the subregion, followed by the industrial sector. Widespread 
  use of biomass for energy results in fewer emissions from electricity generation 
  than in Northern and Southern African countries.</p>
<p>Equatorial zones are expected to experience a 5 per cent increase in annual 
  rainfall and temperature rise of 1.4&deg;C as a result of climate change. Although 
  parts of the Sahel could receive increased rainfall, the Sahel in general will 
  be more prone to desertification because of increased evaporation and run-off 
  (IPCC 1998, IPCC 2001b). In addition, increased intensity of rainfall may increase 
  soil erosion, nutrient leaching and crop damage. Loss of rainfall in marginal 
  and vulnerable areas would exacerbate drought and desiccation problems and increase 
  the risk of bushfires, in turn threatening forest margins. Changes in timing 
  and length of growing seasons may lead to planning problems for agriculture. 
  The recent history of droughts in this zone has reduced national food reserves, 
  and people in the sub-region are now more than ever vulnerable to food shortages. 
  Changing patterns of distribution of forests and other natural habitat may place 
  more animal and plant species under threat of extinction, and inland fisheries 
  are at risk from changing rainfall and flood regimes. In addition to increasing 
  vulnerability in the Sahelian zone, there is increased vulnerability of the 
  equatorial zone to sea level rises as a consequence of climate change. Côte 
  d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Nigeria, and Senegal are among the most vulnerable countries 
  in Western Africa (IPCC 1998).</p>
<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Western Africa</h4>
<p>In response to climate variability and climate change, all of the countries 
  of Western Africa (with the exception of Liberia) have ratified the UNFCCC. 
  Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol-under which countries stand to benefit from 
  funds for forest conservation and adoption of cleaner technologies-is expected 
  shortly.</p>
<p>The need for coping strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate variability 
  and drought is equally important, and significant progress has been made in 
  this area in the past 30 years. The AGRHYMET Regional Centre was established 
  in 1974 by the Permanent Inter- State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel 
  (CILSS) following the Sahelian drought of the 1970s. Its primary function is 
  to act as regional producer of raw data and analysed information, and to provide 
  training in agrometeorology, hydrology, monitoring and evaluation, and plant 
  protection. The nine member states of CILSS participating in the AGHRYMET activities 
  are Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, 
  Niger and Senegal. AGRHYMET's Major Programme on Information aims to produce 
  information relating specifically to food security, the fight against desertification, 
  and livestock management.</p>
