<h3>THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>Human population growth, the selective and accidental introduction of alien 
  species, urbanization, rapid change in use of land for cultivation, hunting, 
  pollution and degradation of soil have all taken their toll on endemic species 
  of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians and the Islands' biodiversity 
  is now seriously under threat. All of the West Indian Ocean Islands are important 
  endemic bird areas and four islands in Seychelles are bird sanctuaries. The 
  greatest threat to their biodiversity is habitat destruction resulting from 
  expansion of agriculture and of human settlements, with additional threats from 
  natural processes such as coastal erosion, bush fires and seawater intrusion. 
  The continued extension of agriculture into the natural forest and woodland 
  areas exerts a continuous pressure on already endangered species of flora and 
  fauna in the islands. Grazing by introduced species of animals such as deer, 
  goats and cattle has diminished plants not adapted to grazing and has led to 
  a predominance of exotic grasses. In addition, sugar cane, coffee, and tea estates 
  now use large areas of land for these imported species, and the high dependency 
  on wood and charcoal for household use has further depleted forest and woodland 
  areas (UNEP 1999).</p>
<p>In Madagascar, grassland fires are commonly used to clear land at the end of 
  the dry season, and this is contributing to the destruction of woodlands and 
  threatening the habitat of birds, insects and mammals which depend on the forest 
  cover for survival. In 1995, more than 1.2 million hectares of Madagascar's 
  forest were destroyed by grassland fires (4 900 ha of natural forest and 10 
  287 of plantation forest) (Republic of Madagascar, 1997). In Mauritius burning 
  of sugar cane is a common cause of habitat destruction for insects, birds and 
  reptiles, as well as a source of air pollution.</p>
<p>Modification of freshwater habitats through pollution is another cause of reductions 
  in biodiversity on the islands, as are selective harvesting and overharvesting. 
  For example, collection of fuelwood is a form of selective harvesting that is 
  contributing to loss of quality of habitat and to reduction of species diversity. 
  Overharvesting of land tortoises and marine turtles over the past three decades 
  has contributed to their decline (RFIC 1998).</p>
<p>Western Indian Ocean Island coastal and marine habitats and species are under 
  threat from destructive fishing practices, overharvesting, and intense tourism. 
  Mangrove clearance means loss of buffering against ocean swells and is accelerating 
  coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion. Nursery grounds for shrimp, crab and 
  other species are also being lost as mangroves are reduced. Mining of coral 
  and sand for use in construction is also damaging habitats, and threatening 
  the biodiversity they support. Intensive tourism is thought to be damaging the 
  coral reef habitats by pollution from boats, hotels and other infrastructure 
  and facilities, and by excessive walking on coral or its removal for souvenirs.</p>
<p>Island species are particularly vulnerable to competition and predation by 
  invasive alien species. Animal species introduced to the Western Indian Ocean 
  Islands include rats and mice, rabbits, pigs, and the long-tailed macaque (Macaca 
  fascicularis). This latter species is a problem for farmers as it regularly 
  damages crops. It is also contributing to the extinction of many wild bird species 
  through predation on their nests. Rodents are also problem predators and have 
  contributed to the demise of birds and reptiles. The two most prolific alien 
  plant species in Mauritius are the Chinese guava (Psidium cattleianum), from 
  South America, and the privet (Ligustrum robustrum) from Asia. Neither species 
  is kept in check by natural consumers or competition and they therefore form 
  dense thickets in the upland forests, preventing other species from regenerating. 
  Lowland forests are being invaded by liane cerf, wild pepper, and aloe. </p>
