<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>Land and terrestrial resources in Africa have unparalleled economic, social 
  and environmental value. Traditionally, African societies are agrarian or pastoral, 
  depending directly on subsistence farming to meet their daily needs. Commercial 
  agriculture holds an equally important position, employing the largest share 
  of the workforce in most countries, and contributing significantly to national 
  economic growth, export earnings and foreign exchange. However, national and 
  household dependency on agricultural output has been a significant factor in 
  limited economic growth over the past three decades. Climatic instability has 
  caused significant and frequent variability in production, and narrow crop diversity, 
  and national and international market failures, have facilitated recurrent economic 
  losses.</p>

<p>Rapid population growth, and policy pressures to increase production, have 
  forced the cultivation of greater and greater areas of land in all sub-regions, 
  and the extension of cultivation and grazing to marginal areas. Combined with 
  limited application of organic or inorganic fertilizers, reductions in fallow 
  periods, restrictions on crop diversity, inappropriate irrigation, and an increasing 
  use of herbicides and pesticides, this has resulted in the physical, chemical 
  and biological degradation of vegetation and soil. Soil erosion and desertification 
  rates are increasing as a result, and declines in productivity have been noted.</p>
<p>More than 20 per cent of Africa's vegetated lands are classified as degraded, 
  and 66 per cent of this is moderately to severely degraded. The worst affected 
  areas are along desert margins, and the problem is likely to intensify over 
  the next 30 years, as a result of population growth and increasing climate variability. 
  Land degradation impacts are felt most keenly by the poor, because they are 
  forced to cultivate marginal lands, such as desert margins, which get degraded 
  more rapidly. Hence, productivity losses are more rapid, and affected households 
  become increasingly food insecure. Environmental consequences of erosion include: 
  sedimentation; pollution; eutrophication of waterbodies; smothering of aquatic 
  habitats; and changes to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Responses have included: ratification of international conventions; and implementation 
  of awareness raising and action planning at national level. Sub-regional cooperation 
  has also been initiated, through national and sub-regional organizations, such 
  as CILSS, ECOWAS, IGAD and SADC, which have developed food security strategies, 
  and strategies for improving the condition and management of resources. NEAPs 
  have provided overall frameworks for enhancing planning and development of land 
  resources, and EIAs have facilitated the implementation of the tenets held in 
  the NEAPs. Local level responses have perhaps seen the most rapid and dramatic 
  results, because they have not experienced the institutional and logistical 
  constraints of actions attempted at national and subregional levels. Local level 
  measures have included: diversification of cropping; increased fallow; crop 
  rotation; creation of wind breaks; application of manure and other organic wastes; 
  and responsible and conservative irrigation schemes.</p>
<p>Land tenure and access to land resources are complex issues in Africa, impacting 
  on food security, environmental sustainability and social security. Colonial 
  legislation often conflicted with traditional tenurial systems, and was aimed 
  at increasing commercial production, often at the expense of household production. 
  With independence, African countries attempted to redress the issue of traditional 
  access rights, whilst maintaining control of resources, especially economically 
  important ones. Realizing the inadequacies, overlaps and contradictions in existing 
  land policies, governments embarked on further processes of land reform. However, 
  these are fraught with tensions between user groups and different land uses. 
  Women, generally, have fewer ownership rights although, in many countries, women 
  are involved in most food production activities. Political and environmental 
  refugees frequently place additional burdens on issues of tenure, and on the 
  resources themselves. Refugees who are settled in marginal or sensitive areas 
  cause extensive degradation, whilst further potential conflicts exist with neighbouring 
  communities.</p>
<p>Improved security of tenure can greatly improve land management practices, 
  and rural development programmes should focus on greater inputs to farming, 
  freer trade and higher value addition. This will ensure that: greater income 
  is earned from production; greater food security is awarded to the household 
  producer; and expansion of agriculture into marginal areas is controlled. Poverty 
  alleviation schemes are also required, in order to keep people from abandoning 
  their farms, and to ensure that they are able to afford inputs, such as fertilizers 
  and efficient irrigation systems (UNU 1998).</p>
<p>Policy reforms are another essential component of resolving conflicts over 
  resources and of ensuring greater investment in sound resource management activities. 
  However, these reforms have to be made carefully, with the full participation 
  of all stakeholder groups. This is a process which will take time, but which 
  will avoid further conflicts in rights or their administration. Legislation 
  is also only a part of what governments can contribute towards land reforms. 
  Other actions include: decentralization of administrative power; more comprehensive 
  land use planning and management frameworks; more effective participation by 
  stakeholders; and economic diversification, in order to relieve some of the 
  dependence on commercial agriculture and forestry. The involvement of women 
  and children is particularly important, because the spread of HIV/AIDS will 
  mean that, in future, more households are headed by these groups. Pastoralists 
  must be involved in management plans for grazing areas, in order to maintain 
  livestock production at the household level and to maintain its contribution 
  to national economies.</p>
