<p>This chapter provides a synthesis of the issues covered in the previous chapters 
  of AEO, followed by an analysis of policy responses for the implementation of 
  a sustainable environment and development agenda for Africa. The chapter closes 
  with a key output of the AEO process: 31 recommendations for specific actions 
  by policy makers.</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>The wealth of a nation is measured by its total national capital, that is to 
  say, the sum of its human-made capital, natural capital, human skills capital 
  and social capital (Serageldin 1994). This is illustrated in easily memorizable 
  form in <a href="#box51">Box 5.1</a>. For development to be sustainable, the 
  stock of national capital at any given time in the future must be greater than 
  the current amount.</p>
<p>Africa has increased its total capital over the past 30 years. In spite of 
  the challenges the region has faced from colonial times to the present, its 
  overall stock of total capital-both absolute and per capita-has increased when 
  measured in terms of GDP (UNDP 2000). <a href="#tab51">Table 5.1</a> shows this 
  trend for selected African countries, for 1975, 1985 and 1998. The individual 
  components of total capital are considered in a little more detail, below:</p>

    In the past three decades, Africa's stock of <b>humanmade capital</b> (for 
    example, buildings, highways and factories) has increased, as indicated by 
    the proliferation of urban areas in the region.</li>
  <li><b>Natural capita</b>l (soils, forests, minerals, oil and gas, fisheries, 
    wildlife) has declined, as evidenced by the degree of environmental degradation 
    already described in this report.</li>
  <li>Levels of investment in education indicate that, in absolute terms, Africa's<b> 
    human-skills capital</b> has increased over the past 30 years (UNDP 2000), 
    although this increase is currently threatened by the poor working conditions 
    and inadequate motivation of the region's skilled labour force. This is evidenced 
    by Africa's 'brain drain' problem.</li>
  <li>Africa's <i>social capital</i>-the sum of democratic governance systems, 
    social services, institutional capacity and the empowerment of women and other 
    marginalized groups-can also be surmised to have increased. Compared to 30 
    years ago, African countries are increasingly democratizing, are devolving 
    power from the centre to lower levels, and are empowering communities and 
    civil society organizations to participate meaningfully and effectively in 
    decision making. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, this apparently positive picture is somewhat deceptive. Four reasons 
  for this are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While absolute and per capita amounts of total capital have increased on 
    a region-wide basis, there are wide disparities between countries, with increases 
    in some and declines in others. For example, over the past 30 years, per capita 
    GDP has tripled in Mauritius, almost doubled in Seychelles and increased to 
    a degree in Tunisia. On the other hand, it has declined in Gabon, Ghana, South 
    Africa and Sierra Leone, and has more or less stagnated in Kenya. In Ghana, 
    Sierra Leone and South Africa, per capita GDP was higher in 1975 than in 1998.</li>
  <li>The rate of growth of Africa's total capital is lower than that of all developing 
    countries combined, which means the increase is not sufficient to bring about 
    significant change.</li>
  <li>The distribution of total capital is not equitable. For example, in 1987-98, 
    the poorest 20 per cent of Sierra Leone's population benefited from a paltry 
    1.1 per cent of income consumption (that is to say, only 1.1 per cent of the 
    'national cake'). The picture is little better for the rest of Africa, where 
    the proportion was less than 10 per cent (UNDP 2000).</li>
  <li>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the increase in Africa's total capital 
    has been achieved through the transformation of natural capital into other 
    forms of capital. In principle, such transformation is not a reason for concern 
    so long as the total sum of capital is increasing. In Africa, however, there 
    is reason for concern, because the process of transformation has been unsustainable 
    and continues to be so. For example, in many parts of Africa the rates of 
    harvesting from forests, fisheries and wildlife resources exceed their sustainable 
    levels, and utilization of resources has been wasteful.</li>

<p>Overall, while some African countries, such as Seychelles and Mauritius, have 
  significantly improved the quality of life of their people, the majority of 
  African countries are in the low human development index (HDI) category (UNDP 
  2000). As of the year 2000, Cape Verde Islands, Ghana and Kenya were the only 
  three countries in the western and eastern African subregions to have medium 
  HDIs; the rest of the countries were in the low HDI group (UNDP 2000).</p>
<p>The link between environment and development is particularly strong in Africa 
  because national economies are dependent on agriculture and natural resources 
  at the primary production and processing stages. The combined contribution of 
  agriculture and industry (largely natural-resource based) to GDP is significant, 
  especially in those countries with lower HDIs. For example, in Sierra Leone-the 
  country with the lowest HDI in the world-agriculture and industry represent 
  68 per cent of GDP (UNDP 2000). Yet many African countries, especially those 
  in the eastern and western sub-regions, belong to this category. Sound management 
  of the environment, therefore, has important implications for rural livelihoods, 
  overall economic growth and better quality of life.</p>
<p>Although African countries have made some improvements in environmental management, 
  many challenges still remain and should be addressed. For example, the current 
  levels of land degradation; deforestation; loss of biodiversity; overharvesting 
  of natural resources; atmospheric pollution; lack of access to clean and safe 
  water and sanitation services; and poor urban conditions are manifestations 
  of remaining unfavourable conditions. If nothing is done, these factors will 
  combine to undermine Africa's prospects for sustainable development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inadequacy of economic opportunities in Africa, the existence 
  of trade barriers and farming subsidies in the developed countries, and the 
  declining state of the region's environment mean that its people are becoming 
  increasingly vulnerable to adverse changes in the environment. Many African 
  countries are not adequately equipped to deal with natural disasters, such as 
  floods, droughts and earthquakes, and emerging health problems such as the HIV/AIDS 
  pandemic (discussed in <a href="234.htm">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<p>Africa's challenge is captured in a statement attributed to H.E. President 
  Olusegun Obasanjo, of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and reproduced in <a href="#box52">Box 
  5.2</a>. In the face of such a challenge, defining paths to sustainable development 
  is a necessity if Africans- especially those in the eastern and western subregions 
  where HDIs are low-are to achieve the better quality of life they deserve and 
  are to be able to improve their environment.</p>

<p><a name="img51"></a>African states have put in place a number of policy responses 
  to address environmental issues. Many new national environmental policies, laws 
  and regulations have been introduced and African countries are parties to a 
  number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). The catalogue of documents 
  relating to environmental management clearly shows that-on paper at least- problems 
  have been addressed extensively (NEMA 2001). However, these remain mere intentions 
  unless implemented. Moreover, even after implementation, there is a need to 
  verify that effects on the environment are positive and adequate (NEMA 2001). 
</p>
<p>Quantitative assessment of the success or failure of policy initiatives and 
  developments is not an easy task. African states face the same problems as the 
  rest of the global community where analysis of policy responses is concerned. 
  Global experience indicates that assessment of the effects of implementation 
  and of efficiency is made particularly difficult by uneven monitoring, poor 
  and missing data, a lack of indicators and continuous reporting, and paucity 
  of data on the environmental situation before and after implementation (UNEP 
  1999). Furthermore, there are no suitable mechanisms, methodologies or criteria 
  to determine which policy contributes to which change in the state of environment. 
  Such problems often prevent valid comparisons between the current situation 
  and what would have happened if no policy action had been taken. A more complete 
  and precise analysis will require the development of better mechanisms to monitor 
  and assess the effects of environmental policies on the quality of the environment 
  (UNEP 1999). </p>
<p>It is clear from this overview that there is a need to review and recommend 
  achievable actions at national, sub-regional and regional levels, and to consider 
  their implications for implementation at these levels and for the global environmental 
  agenda. The difficulties outlined above notwithstanding, the remaining sections 
  of this chapter identify appropriate policy responses, analyse their implications 
  and provide recommendations for action.</p>
