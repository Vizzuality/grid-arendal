      <p>'The environment is the business of everybody, development is the business

        solution will be found in encouraging mass environmental literacy so that 
        there can be democratic and literate decisions, because if decisions are 
        taken by a few without the incorporation of the opinion of the masses, 
        the NGOs especially included, the likelihood is that the situations will 
        not succeed.'</p>

<p>The 1980 World Conservation Strategy (WCS), which was developed by the World 
  Conservation Union (IUCN), introduced the concept of sustainable development.</p>
<p>The WCS influenced African governments to undertake their own national conservation 
  strategies, satisfying one of the objectives of the 1972 Stockholm Conference, 
  that is, to incorporate the environment in development planning. While such 
  policy documents became common, particularly in the 1980s, the environment did 
  not immediately become part of mainstream activity, as indicated by the small 
  annual budget allocations for environmental management.</p>
<h4>World Commission on Environment and Development</h4>
<p>The WCED was established in 1983 in response to the United Nations General 
  Assembly (UN GA) Resolution 38/161, which mandated the WCED to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>examine the critical environment and development issues, and formulate realistic 
    proposals for dealing<br>
    with them; </li>
  <li>propose new forms of international cooperation on issues that would influence 
    policies and events in<br>
    the direction of necessary change; and </li>
  <li>raise levels of understanding and commitment to the action of individuals, 
    voluntary organizations,<br>
    business institutions and governments. </li>
</ul>
<p>The UN GA asked the WCED to formulate 'A Global Agenda for Change' on the environment 
  and development. The WCED's Environmental Perspectives: examine issues in their 
  relationship to the challenges of social and economic development; set out goals 
  for environmentally sound and sustainable development; and call upon governments, 
  international organizations, industry, financial institutions and NGOs to take 
  specific actions to achieve those goals (UNEP/OAU 1991). The WCED, or the Brundtland 
  Commission, popularized sustainable development in its 1987 report, Our Common 
  Future. The WCED's definition of sustainable development-development that meets 
  the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations 
  to meet their own needs- is now part of the environment lexicon. The WCED process 
  also popularized public participation in environmental issues, because it convened 
  many public meetings in Africa, and in other developed and developing regions.</p>
<p>Some of the actions recommended by the WCED for African countries are shown 
  in <a href="#box13">Box 1.3</a>.</p>

            <p>The WCED has defined sustainable development as 'a process in which 
              the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the 
              orientation of technological development and institutional change 
              are made consistent with future as well as present needs'. For Africa, 
              this entails massive house-cleaning exercises, and international 
              negotiations yet unmatched among national governments, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>providing more resources to meet the priority needs of the people, 
                rather than satisfying the needs of international creditors; </li>
              <li>utilizing the ability and the aspirations of the people in development 
                plans, so that poverty<br>
                alleviation becomes a core element as they move towards sustainable 
                evelopment;<br>
              </li>
              <li>setting up democratic domestic mechanisms to harmonize the activities 
                of NGOs operating in Africa with development policies defined 
                by governments; </li>
              <li>negotiating for commodity prices which reflect the real cost 
                of production for Africa; and<br>
              </li>
              <li>carrying out intensive intra- Africa trade.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the issues that put the destiny of Africa at stake. They 
              can only be ignored at great cost to an environmentally sound future 
              for the region.</p>
