<h5>Biodiversity</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Biodiversity, ecosystems and habitats receive adequate national and international 
  protection, as result of policies and practices. The value of biodiversity, 
  ecosystems and habitats is recogniszed globally and nationally, with a fair 
  share of benefits from sustainable use accruing to local communities and national 
  governments. Trade in rare species is fairly regulated, and is driven by ethics 
  and moral values. Incremental loss of biodiversity due to human activity is 
  reduced to zero, and there are no endangered species.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, there is active collaboration between modern 
  conservation powers and methods and traditional conservation powers and methods, 
  in order to end biodiversity loss. Greater subregional cooperation is developed, 
  in terms of biodiversity conservation, with regard to transborder reserves (present-day 
  situation in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and Central Africa). There is also development 
  and strengthening of sub-regional programmes, such as the Regional Programme 
  for the Management of Environmental Information (ECOFAC), which put data on 
  the state of the environment at the disposal of decision makers, and which ensure 
  the conservation of Protected Areas Resources. The biodiversity protection of 
  class A species of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
  (CITES) and other endangered species is ensured by all countries in the sub-region. 
  The conservation programmes, and access to environmental information developed 
  within the subregion, are sustained by international financial backers and cooperation 
  funds.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>Pressure from global stakeholders focuses the attention of national governments 
  on biodiversity management. More national resources are channelled into the 
  implementation of relevant conventions. National laws are enacted or reviewed, 
  to bring them in tandem with these conventions. The countries of the sub-region 
  promote new products and processes which enhance the potential biodiversity 
  resource, including medicinal plants. This elevates the profile of biodiversity 
  resources and the need to protect them.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, biodiversity in this sub-region benefits 
  from the overall improvement in environmental conditions. One key factor causing 
  serious damage to biodiversity and to the ecosystems of water bodies was the 
  disposal of very low-quality wastewater. As the quality of wastewater greatly 
  improves, so does the health of biodiversity. The whole ecosystem shows symptoms 
  of recovery, after long deterioration. Public awareness and better education 
  help the governments to preserve biodiversity, as people take an active role 
  in the process.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Collaborative conservation efforts between traditional practices and modern 
  research methods result in a slowdown in the loss of biological diversity, while 
  widespread EIAs reduce loss of habitat. Cooperation in the management of migratory 
  species, and the use of international instruments, such CITES, also result in 
  the conservation of biodiversity.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, comprehensive policies and appropriate legislation 
  are in force to protect special species of flora and fauna. Large tracts of 
  lands, including wetlands, are under protection, to ensure that biodiversity 
  is not destroyed by development activities. These successes are promoting ecotourism.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>No large mammals in this sub-region survived the previous era, apart from humans, 
  and the region suffered serious loss of marine and bird life. However, in the 
  Great Transitions scenario, institutions gather mating pairs of marine, land 
  species and birds and- either by cloning from deep-frozen DNA or through natural 
  breading programmes-achieve remarkable species survival. Following the establishment 
  of a new regional government, there follows a re-transfer of pools of regenerated 
  species. The pink pigeon becomes a regional icon, alongside the dodo. The invasions 
  of vultures and other birds of prey, which created problems in Madagascar and 
  the Comoros in the past, are dispersed, with the introduction of sparrow hawks 
  and eagles. These also serve to provide natural control of the growing problem 
  of urban pigeons, which are a hazard to humans and aircraft alike.</p>
