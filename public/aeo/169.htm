<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Africa's water resources are characterized by extreme variability, both over 
  time and space. Rainfall varies from less than 20 mm/yr in the arid countries 
  encompassing the Sahara desert to more than 1 000 mm/yr in the humid tropical 
  belt of western, eastern and central Africa. Inter-annual variations can be 
  extremely high, and drought and/or flooding is common in most African countries. 
  The cost of such extreme events runs to millions of dollars every year, a price 
  that many African countries cannot afford either to incur or to prevent.</p>
<p>Natural climatic variations, and the location of major urban and industrial 
  centres in dry or waterstressed areas, presents a formidable challenge for water 
  service providers. With anticipated increases in unpredictability and variation 
  in precipitation due to global climate change, and increases in demand from 
  a rapidly growing population and economic developments, the way in which water 
  resources are managed in Africa needs to be radically reformed in order to meet 
  the goal of equitable access to sufficient water of acceptable quality, and 
  to facilitate agricultural and industrial development. (See <a href="#box2e12">Box 
  2e.12</a>.) </p>

<p>Increases in demand for freshwater are anticipated in all African countries, 
  in all sectors (domestic, agricultural and industrial), over the next 10 years. 
  In some countries, demand is projected to double within the next 30 years. This 
  arises not just from an increase in the number of people requiring water, but 
  also from increasing consumption patterns, especially among the wealthier communities. 
  Likewise, industries rarely pay the true price of water and are, therefore, 
  not encouraged to recycle or to reduce their consumption. Surface and groundwater 
  supplies have been exploited, and some countries have turned to alternative 
  sources of water, in order to attempt to meet this increasing demand, including 
  desalinization of seawater and recycling of wastewater.</p>

      <p>Most African countries cite declining water quality as a priority issue 
        for the environmental and developmental agenda. The most common sources 
        of freshwater pollution are sewage, industrial effluents and agricultural 
        run-off. They are due, in large part, to inadequate wastewater treatment 
        facilities, as well as to ineffective pollution control</p>

<p>Most African countries cite declining water quality as a priority issue for

  due, in large part, to inadequate wastewater treatment facilities, as well as 
  to ineffective pollution control. </p>
<p>The principles of IWRM have been widely adopted in Africa, as a systematic 
  approach for tackling the technical, hydrological, economic, environmental, 
  social and legal aspects of water quality and supply problems. A central tenet 
  of IWRM is to move away from supply management methods, such as the construction 
  of dams, towards demand management methods, such as removal of water subsidies 
  and the enforcement of polluter payments. IWRM also requires the joint management 
  of water resources by all users, from local communities to water service providers, 
  municipalities, industries and agricultural organizations. Although adopted 
  in principle in the region, implementation of IWRM has, to date, been impeded 
  by: capacity constraints; lack of financial resources; institutional fragmentation; 
  poor availability of information; and lack of commitment by various partners.</p>
