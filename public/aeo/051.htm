<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Emissions of GHGs by Southern Africa (in particular South Africa) are higher 
  than those for other subregions of Africa, although they represent only 2 per 
  cent of the world total. The sub-region's emissions are, however, projected 
  to rise as countries develop, including a threefold increase in Zimbabwe over 
  the next 50 years (Southern Centre 1996). South Africa already has a net positive 
  GHG emission level-it accounts for the majority of emissions from the subregion 
  and 42 per cent of all emissions from Africa (World Bank 2000a, Marland and 
  others 2000).</p>
<p>The majority of Southern Africa's primary energy comes from fossil fuels, in 
  the form of coal and petroleum, and its level of industrialization is high compared 
  to other parts of Africa. It is therefore imperative that the sub-region adopt 
  a two-pronged approach, introducing cleaner technologies and renewable sources 
  of energy production while simultaneously improving coping capacities to deal 
  with the anticipated impacts of an increasingly variable and unpredictable climate.</p>
<p>Southern Africa's background of climate variability, food insecurity and water 
  stress makes it one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change (IPCC 1998, 
  IPCC 2001b). The sub-region is expected to experience a mean temperature rise 
  of 1.5&deg;C and increased rainfall variability and insecurity (Hulme 1995). 
  The expected impacts of these changes include reductions in the extent of grasslands 
  and expansion of thorn savannas and dry forest, together with a general increase 
  in the extent of desertification across the subregion. This will in turn affect 
  the distribution of wildlife and some of the major national parks could suffer 
  economic losses through reduced tourism potential (IPCC 2001b). Crop yields 
  are also expected to vary, dropping by as much as 10-20 per cent in some parts 
  of the sub-region (GLOBE 2001). It is also predicted that the malaria-carrying 
  <i>Anopheles</i> female mosquito will spread to parts of Namibia and South Africa 
  where it has not been found before (IPCC 1998).</p>
<p>According to the IPCC, global sea levels are expected to rise by between 10 
  and 100 cm by 2100, due to snow and ice melt. This could inundate up to 2 117 
  km<sup>2</sup> and erode up to 9 km<sup>2</sup> of the coast of Tanzania, with 
  a cost of more than US$50 million (IPCC 1998). The economies of most Southern 
  African countries are highly vulnerable to a changing climate because of their 
  dependence on commercial agriculture. In addition, over 50 per cent of the sub-region's 
  population is based in rural areas and is directly dependent on small-scale 
  cultivation and rearing of livestock.</p>
<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>To date, all of the 11 countries of the Southern African sub-region have signed 
  and ratified the UNFCCC, signalling the importance with which they regard climate 
  change. Several countries have embarked on the production of National Communications 
  Strategies to document GHG emissions and sinks, and have developed strategies 
  for mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>A sub-region-wide initiative is also underway to develop a strategy for GHG 
  reduction in Southern Africa. Tanzania's Centre for Energy, Environment, Science 
  & Technology, in collaboration with Zimbabwe's Southern Centre for Energy and 
  Environment and Zambia's Centre for Energy, Environment and Engineering are 
  coordinating studies for this initiative.</p>
<p>South Africa, the sub-region's largest contributor to GHG emissions, has established 
  a National Committee for Climate Change to advise its Minister of Environmental 
  Affairs on the implications of climate change and policy options for reducing 
  emissions. In 1996, the government of Zimbabwe reviewed the country's environmental 
  legislation and incorporated climate change issues. A climate change office 
  was set up within the then Ministry of Mines, Environment and Tourism to coordinate 
  activities on the subject (Government of Zimbabwe 1999).</p>
<p>In Mozambique, plans are underway for a treeplanting scheme which should qualify 
  for funds from the Cleaner Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. This 
  project aims to restore native Miombo woodlands in Gorongosa National Park and 
  to provide economic opportunities to local communities through sales of timber 
  and development of eco-tourism.</p>
