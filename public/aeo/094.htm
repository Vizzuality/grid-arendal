<p><a name="fig2c1"></a>There are various definitions of the geographical, legal 
  and functional scope of a coastal zone. According to Clark (1996), <i>'at a 
  minimum, the designated coastal zone includes all the inter-tidal and supra-tidal 
  areas of the water's edge; specifically all the coastal floodplains, mangroves, 
  marshes and tide-flats as well as beaches and dunes and fringing coral reefs.'</i> 
  Africa's 40 000 km coast consists of a narrow, low-lying coastal belt which, 
  as shown in <a href="#fig2c1">Figure 2c.1</a>, includes the continental shelf 
  and coasts of 32 mainland countries.</p>
<p>Coastal ecosystems and issues relating to management of the coast often cross 
  political boundaries and frequently extend inland. Similarly, the boundaries 
  of marine ecosystems do not necessarily correspond with those of Exclusive Economic 
  Zones (EEZ)-the 200 nautical-mile zones from the land edge of coastal states 
  where they have sovereign rights over natural resources and over certain economic 
  activities. Discussion of issues affecting the coastal environment may therefore 
  extend beyond country borders or over more than one sub-region. There may therefore 
  be some overlap in the analyses presented here.</p>
<h3>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS</h3>
<p>Coastal ecosystems are some of the most biologically productive in the world, 
  occupying only 8 per cent of the earth's surface but accounting for 26 per cent 
  of all biological productivity (Hare 1994). These high productivity rates result 
  from the extreme climatic and physical conditions of coasts, and the dynamic 
  nature of the forces acting on these zones. Opportunistic organisms have adapted 
  to these conditions and their rapid rates of growth and reproduction when conditions 
  are favourable have led to high productivity rates.</p>
<p>The African coastal zone supports a diversity of habitats and resources encompassing 
  mangroves, rocky shores, sandy beaches, deltas, estuaries and coastal wetlands, 
  coral reefs and lagoons. Coral reefs and mangroves are especially important 
  features because they protect the coastline by moderating storm and wave impacts 
  and because mangroves stabilize sand and soils, cycle nutrients, absorb and 
  break down waste products, provide wildlife habitat, and maintain biodiversity. 
  Reefs and mangroves also contribute significantly to the economies of coastal 
  countries by providing opportunities for tourism and for harvesting of resources. 
  For example, mangrove species are used extensively by local communities for 
  construction material, fuel, food and animal fodder, and for medicinal preparations. 
  Mangroves extend from Senegal to Angola on Africa's west coast and from Somalia 
  to South Africa on the east coast. Coral reefs- some of them spectacular-are 
  abundant in the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><a name="fig2c2"></a>Periodic upwelling in African waters encourages diverse 
  and rich production in fisheries, including crustaceans, fish, and molluscs. 
  In 1997, total marine fish catch exports from Africa contributed US$445 million 
  to countries' economies (FAOSTAT 2001). Fisheries in estuaries and lagoons also 
  contribute to national economies, accounting for over three-quarters of fishery 
  landings in Africa (IPCC 1998). Fisheries also provide significant amounts of 
  employment, particularly in small islands such as Cape Verde and Seychelles 
  where more than one-third of agricultural workers are employed in the fisheries 
  sector (FAO 1996). Artisanal fishing activities are also an important source 
  of income for coastal communities and fish is an important source of protein 
  for many African populations, as shown in <a href="#fig2c2">Figure 2c.2</a>.</p>
<p>Oil and gas reserves and other mineral deposits, including diamonds off the 
  western and south-western African coast, are additional important economic resources 
  for coastal countries. For example, in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and 
  Togo the majority of industries and oil and mineral mining activities are located 
  in the coastal zone.</p>
<p>The ports of Mombasa, Maputo and Durban are also major trade centres. Industrial 
  development has expanded in the neighbouring areas to take advantage of opportunities 
  for trade, tourism and other commercial activities opened up by the ports.</p>
<p>The highly attractive and diverse resources of the coastal and marine environments 
  mean that coastal areas in Africa (as elsewhere in the world) are experiencing 
  rapid population growth, industrial expansion and infrastructure development. 
  Most colonial settlements in Africa were established along the coast in order 
  to maximize trade opportunities and this has resulted in all but three of African 
  countries from Mauritania to Namibia having their capital cities on the coast. 
  A large proportion of Western Africa's urban population also now lives in coastal 
  cities. The exceptional demand for resources and infrastructure development 
  in the coastal zone is putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and 38 per cent 
  of Africa's coastal ecosystems are under severe threat from developmentrelated 
  activities (FAO 1998). The major challenges facing coastal African countries 
  at present are coastal erosion, the potential impacts of climate change, overharvesting 
  of resources and pollution. Although the causes of coastal erosion and climate 
  change are entirely different the effects of climate change are so frequently 
  and so firmly interlinked with those of erosion that they are described in the 
  same sections in the following analyses.</p>
