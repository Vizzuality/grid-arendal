<p><a name="img2g6"></a>Approximately 38 per cent of the population of Western 
  Africa lives in urban areas-on a par with the average for Africa as a whole 
  (UNCHS 2001a). Cape Verde is the most urbanized country with 62 per cent of 
  the population living in urban areas, and Burkina Faso the least with just 18.5 
  per cent of its population in urban areas (UNCHS 2001a). The predicted average 
  rate of urbanization for 2000-2015 ranges from over five per cent in Burkina 
  Faso and Niger to three per cent in Cape Verde (UNCHS 2001a). Thirty years ago, 
  only one Western African city (Lagos) had a population of more than a million. 
  By 2000, cities with populations exceeding one million included Ouagadougou 
  (Burkina Faso), Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire), Accra (Ghana), Conakry (Guinea), Bamako 
  (Mali), Ibadan (Nigeria), Lagos (Nigeria), and Dakar (Senegal). Lagos, the largest 
  city in Africa and the 6th largest in the world, has an estimated current population 
  of 13.4 million people and this is expected to grow to over 23 million by 2015 
  (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The growth in urban populations in Western Africa is the result of a combination 
  of high overall population growth, and migration. Migration, in turn, is a composite 
  of rural push factors and urban pull factors. The population pressures, climatic 
  variability, and fragmentation of tenure and traditional systems, contribute 
  to degradation of soil and vegetation, diminishing yields and worsening food 
  insecurity in rural areas. Prevailing educational systems are also more oriented 
  towards training people in urban occupations than to improving agriculture or 
  animal husbandry in rural areas.</p>
<p>The lure of employment and the perception of improved quality of life in urban 
  areas are increasingly attracting rural populations to the cities. The concentration 
  of amenities (such as health care, educational and recreational facilities) 
  in capital cities such as Abidjan, Accra, Dakar, Lagos and Bamako, and minimum 
  wage legislation also makes urban centres more attractive and employment more 
  favourable than the insecure dividends of subsistence farming. Although several 
  countries of the sub-region (including Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Nigeria), 
  experience internal migrations, especially urban-urban migration, a high percentage 
  of migrants from other countries is adding to the growth of towns and urban 
  areas in Western Africa. The percentage of foreign residents in Côte d'Ivoire 
  increased from 23.3 per cent in 1965 to 35.9 per cent in 1990 (Toure & Fadayomi 
  1992).</p>
<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Urban growth rates in Western Africa exceed the capacities of municipalities 
  to provide adequate housing and services such as water supply, sanitation, waste 
  disposal, communications and transport infrastructure, health services, and 
  education. High unemployment in urban areas also contributes to widespread poverty 
  and poor living conditions.</p>
<p>Several coastal wetlands in Western Africa have come under increasing threat 
  in recent years from industrial pollution, eutrophication due to sewage, and 
  contamination with solid wastes. Wildlife habitats, especially waterfowl habitats, 
  have also been destroyed (IDRC 1996). In response, some sites have been declared 
  Wetlands of International Importance under the 1971 Ramsar Convention, and are 
  now protected (Ramsar 2001).</p>
<h4>Unplanned settlements in Western Africa</h4>
<p> Rapid urban growth-complicated by poor urban planning and control of land 
  use, lack of financial resources and inadequate investment in environmental 
  management-has led to the proliferation of urban slums in Western Africa. Although 
  it is difficult to quantify the number of people living in slums, it has been 
  reported that 42 per cent of the population in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, 
  are squatters and, in Nouakchott (Mauritania), approximately 12 per cent of 
  the city's area is taken up with slums (UNCHS 2001c). In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 
  a number of schemes have been implemented to improve the living conditions of 
  the 20 per cent of the population estimated to be living in slums. These include 
  the Programme for Institutional Support to Settlement Policy, creation of an 
  Agency for Land Management and the creation of a housing bank (UNCHS 2001c). 
  In Ghana and Nigeria, improved security of tenure and enhanced gender-equality 
  in tenure have been reported in recent years, resulting from sound municipal 
  governance and the evolution of democracy. Although there is no legislated right 
  to adequate housing, the governments aim to provide protection from forced eviction 
  by documenting ownership of properties (UNCHS 2001c). Similar efforts are underway 
  in Senegal (see <a href="#box2g5">Box 2g.5</a>).</p>

            <p>Unplanned developments accounted for 25 per cent of Senegal's urban 
              areas in 1987 when the Dalifort Settlement Upgrading Pilot Project 
              was launched. The programme aimed to assist squatters in improving 
              their own living conditions, whilst adhering to environmentally 
              sound practices. To date 500 inhabitants of Dalifort have secured 
              land titles, and water supply, electricity, garbage collection and 
              individual sanitation has been provided for the 7000 inhabitants. 
              This success has sparked interest from a further nine informal settlements 
              (with a total of 100 000 inhabitants) and a presidential revolving 
              fund has been established to provide financial sustainability.</p>

<p>In 2000, an average of around 70 per cent of Western Africa's urban population 
  had access to improved water supply and sanitation, although there were wide 
  differences across the sub-region (WHO/UNICEF 2000). In Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal, 
  for example, over 90 per cent of urban populations had access to improved water 
  supply, whereas in Guinea- Bissau and Sierra Leone less than 30 per cent of 
  the urban population had access (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Over 90 per cent of the people 
  in urban areas in Cape Verde, Guinea, Mali, and Senegal had access to improved 
  sanitation, whereas in Sierra Leone, just 23 per cent of the urban residents 
  had sanitation (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Data are not available for Liberia.</p>
<p>Water pollution, arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation, is both 
  a public health risk and an environmental problem in many cities. Diarrhoeal 
  diseases are amongst the most prevalent preventable diseases, especially among 
  children, and have been correlated with inadequate sanitation. The World Health 
  Organization reports, for example, that washing hands with soap and water can 
  reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by one-third (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Other water-borne 
  diseases include parasitic worms and flukes, and skin and eye infections. Provision 
  of adequate, clean water supply can reduce the incidence of these diseases by 
  up to 70 per cent (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Furthermore, pollution of surrounding habitats 
  and water sources can render them unsuitable as wildlife habitats or can even 
  cause poisoning of wildlife and loss of biodiversity, as well as reducing their 
  productivity and posing further health risks to local residents.</p>
