<p>Large areas of Africa are characterized by stable atmospheric conditions during 
  the dry winter months. These result in marked thermal inversions, which trap 
  emissions in the lower atmosphere. This natural phenomenon, coupled with a rise 
  in emissions, results in a substantial decline in air quality. In the Market 
  Forces scenario, despite the economic gains from urban and industrial development, 
  most people on the region continue to rely on wood fuels for domestic energy. 
  This is coupled with a rapid growth in industrial and vehicle emissions and, 
  in some parts of the region, in the growth of emissions from coal-fired power 
  stations. The result is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a marked 
  decline in air quality especially, but not only, in urban areas. The incidence 
  of acute respiratory infections and other diseases increases.</p>
<p>Although international environmental treaties and market forces create economic 
  opportunities for African countries and industries, the region remains vulnerable 
  to imperfections in the provisions of international treaties governing climate 
  and other global changes. African countries act to protect the somewhat limited, 
  but hard-won, gains in industrialization, because these fledgling industrialized 
  sectors are considered essential to further economic and social development. 
  Any abatement strategies which burden them in any way, or which increase their 
  financial and operational risks, are considered unacceptable.</p>

<p>In the Market Forces scenario, the issue of tradeable permits also remains 
  controversial. By investing in projects in developing countries that result 
  either in the transfer of more energy-efficient technologies, or in some other 
  initiative that reduces the level of emissions, developed countries or private 
  sector firms could acquire carbon credits, while the developing countries are 
  assumed to benefit economically from the investments. The underlying assumption 
  is that the marginal cost of a unit reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is 
  lower in developing countries than in developed countries, and that it is, therefore, 
  more cost-effective to seek emission reductions by appropriate investments in 
  developing countries. The uncertainties surrounding these interventions, particularly 
  their downstream economic and social costs, and the risk that developed countries 
  will only invest in the low-cost, high-gain options-leaving the more costly 
  options to be adopted later by the developing countries alone as their economies 
  mature-causes most countries to hold back from agreeing to these provisions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Africa remains vulnerable to the effects of climate change, notably 
  to: the increased incidence of droughts and floods; adverse changes in rainfall 
  patterns; and the spread of diseases, such as malaria, to new zones. Reductions 
  in agricultural production as a result of adverse weather conditions- resulting 
  in increased dependency on food aid, the need for food imports, and reduced 
  revenue from exports-as well as the threats of loss of biodiversity loss, changes 
  in land cover and increased land degradation, all emphasize the region's interest 
  in the issue of global climate change.</p>
<p>The continued depletion of the ozone layer, at least for the first two decades 
  covered by the Market Forces scenario, continues to cause health problems, especially 
  in the southern third of Africa. Although the use of ozone-depleting gases is 
  gradually phased out, in line with the Montreal Protocol, pockets still remain 
  because old and polluting technologies are slow to be replaced. In some cases, 
  efforts to ban the use of certain ozonedepleting substances, such as methyl 
  bromide, which is widely used as a fumigant in agriculture, are resisted because 
  of the lack of cheaper or more effective alternatives, and inadequate assistance 
  to governments to encourage and enforce the change.</p>
