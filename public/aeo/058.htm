<p>Rapid urbanization and concentration of economic activities in Western Africa's 
  urban centres is leading to air pollution from industry, vehicle emissions and 
  quarrying activities. Combustion of traditional fuels for domestic energy needs 
  is another major source of air pollution in both urban and rural areas. For 
  example, children in the Gambia exposed to smoky stoves were six times more 
  likely to develop acute respiratory infections than unexposed children (World 
  Bank 2000b). Inadequate urban planning is a significant driving force behind 
  rising emission levels, because residential and commercial centres are often 
  far apart, forcing mass movement of workers on a daily basis. Poor economic 
  development has also contributed to air pollution by creating dependence on 
  old vehicles and dirty fuels.</p>
<p>Pollutants such as sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and heavy 
  metals, together with particulate matter, form dense concentrations of smog 
  in urban centres, causing respiratory diseases, contamination of vegetation 
  and water resources, and corrosion of buildings.</p>
<h4>Towards improving air quality in Western Africa</h4>
<p>Most countries in Western Africa have introduced standards and regulations 
  to control the atmospheric pollution in cities, but lack of resources makes 
  enforcement of these emission standards and regulations weak.</p>
<p>In Accra, Ghana, a project is underway to analyse and monitor sources of air 
  pollution and to compare ambient pollution levels in commercial and residential 
  areas, affluent suburbs and slums (Accra Mail 2001). A recent study of transport 
  in Dakar, Senegal, estimated the costs associated with death or injury, hours 
  wasted through congestion, and health costs relating to air pollution to be 
  equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP (World Bank 2001). This study recommended that 
  planning should be improved to ease the traffic flow and that mass transport 
  should be re-organized. The small French locomotives known as 'Petit Train Bleu' 
  have recently been rehabilitated and this has helped to alleviate urban congestion 
  and pollution as well as providing reliable, secure, affordable mass transit 
  and creating jobs (UNCHS 2001). Other measures to improve air quality include 
  tighter controls on importation of second hand cars from Europe (see <a href="#box2a6">Box 
  2a.6</a>).</p>

            <p>Senegal has become a major importer of used cars in recent years 
              and these now represent 84 per cent of all vehicles in the Dakar 
              region where they constitute a major source of air pollution. The 
              average age of vehicles in Dakar is approximately 15 years for cars 
              and 20 years for buses.More than 40 per cent of the cars have diesel 
              engines, which have particularly toxic emissions. The high level 
              of diesel use results from a combination of many diesel engine cars 
              being imported and many owners replacing petrol engines with diesel 
              engines after importation, because diesel is cheaper than petrol.</p>
            <p>The Senegal Ministry of Environment has proposed a new law to provide 
              new clean air standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The law 
              also re-introduces a requirement for customers to lodge request 
              for cars before they are imported, a measure which was scrapped 
              in 1996. It also rules that imported cars must be under five years 
              old.</p>
            <p>Air quality monitoring stations are to be set up around Dakar, 
              to record ambient pollution levels on a daily basis. The ministry 
              also intends to establish an environmental police force, backed 
              up by the national police force, to impose compliance with the regulations 
              and track down polluting vehicles.</p>
