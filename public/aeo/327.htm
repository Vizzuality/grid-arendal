<h3>RESOURCE MOBILIZATION </h3>
<p>Africa needs external support if it is to succeed in reversing the current 
  trend in environmental degradation. As discussed in earlier chapters, the extreme 
  poverty suffered by many Africans is a major factor contributing to the degradation 
  of Africa's environment. For example, the fact that in Sierra Leone the poorest 
  20 per cent of the population benefits from only 1.1 per cent of income consumption 
  indicates that the majority of its people are deriving livelihoods from subsistence 
  activities largely based on environmental goods and services. Should this trend 
  persist, environmental degradation will continue unabated, and at tremendous 
  cost to the country. Uganda is another example-a conservative estimate puts 
  the annual cost of environmental degradation at 4-12 per cent of the country's 
  GNP (NEMA 2001, Slade and Weitz 1991). If corrective actions are not financed 
  and put in place, the cost of this degradation is likely to increase.</p>
<p>It was agreed at the UNCED (1992), where most African states were represented, 
  that implementing Agenda 21 would require new and additional financial resources. 
  African countries have received external assistance for environmental management, 
  but the resources received have been inadequate, partly because the new and 
  incremental funds being made available to them are less than those agreed at 
  UNCED, and partly because procedural difficulties are hindering access by many 
  African countries to the little funding that is available.</p>
<p>External aid nevertheless represents a significant share of national budgets 
  in Africa-especially in sub- Saharan Africa-and dependence on aid is even more 
  pronounced when it comes to investment in environmental management. Dependence 
  on external aid raises concerns in Africa as to adequacy of funds, sustainability 
  of interventions, and freedom to reflect national priorities rather than priorities 
  perceived by donors. However, in spite of such concerns, incremental funding 
  will still be required if African countries are to continue with implementation 
  of Agenda 21. Moreover, access to funding will have to be easier than at present, 
  and it must be largely in the form of grants rather than loans, however soft.</p>
<p>While it is clear that Africa needs external support in its efforts to reverse 
  environmental degradation, African governments also need to recognize that environment 
  is a priority area for investment. They could, for example, include environment 
  as a priority area for intervention in national poverty reduction strategies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, African states often put too much emphasis on accessing external 
  sources of funds, almost to the exclusion of domestic resources. They should-if 
  they are to become more self-reliant-be more proactive in identifying and developing 
  creative mechanisms to generate funds from the region's significant environmental 
  resources. They could improve the generation of non-tax revenues from environmental 
  resources and services by moving towards charging economic rates for them. Valuation 
  of their environmental resources on the basis of total economic value would 
  allow African governments to introduce more appropriate taxes and to develop 
  nontax sources of revenue, such as user fees. The rationale for, and the benefits 
  of, investing in environmental management are presented in <a href="#box54">Box 
  5.4</a>.</p>

              <li>Holding open future options for resource conservation and development, 
                by formulating good policies so that irreversible losses are avoided, 
                and positive conservation culture and attitudes are inculcated.</li>

<p>The collective will of African states to arrest and to reverse environmental 
  degradation exists, as evidenced by the wide range of responses presented in 
  <a href="333.htm">Annex 1</a>. African states, and regional and sub-regional 
  organizations, also want to do more, as illustrated by recent resolutions (AMCEN 
  2001). The main limitations are financial-mobilization of additional resources 
  is, therefore, a priority.</p>
<h3>THE PROBLEM OF DEBT</h3>
<p>African countries are generally poor and heavily indebted, although the level 
  of indebtedness is declining (see <a href="#fig53">Figure 5.3</a>). Nonetheless, 
  however small the debts may be in absolute amounts, when indexed to debt servicing 
  abilities, they are still a constraint. Despite these odds, African countries 
  have been able to leverage additional funds from external sources for investments 
  in environmental management and, by and large, they have enjoyed goodwill from 
  development partners. Key sources of external financial inflows include loans 
  from the multilateral and regional development banks, and grants from bilateral 
  donors and other agencies.</p>
