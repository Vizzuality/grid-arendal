<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p> Southern Africa's urbanization levels are currently just under the average 
  for the Africa region, with 36 per cent of the sub-region's population living 
  in urban areas (UNCHS 2001a). South Africa and Botswana are the most urbanized 
  countries, with urban populations of 50 per cent each, and Malawi is the least 
  urbanized with just 24 per cent of its population living in urban centres (UNCHS 
  2001a). This is considerably different from the situation 30 years ago, when 
  just 11.2 per cent of the Southern African population lived in towns and cities 
  (WRI, UNEP & UNDP 1992).</p>
<p>The current rate of urbanization is also high, and is predicted to average 
  around 3.5 per cent over the next 15 years, although there are wide differences 
  between countries. For example, South Africa, one of the most urbanized countries 
  in the sub-region, has the lowest rate of urbanization, at 1.2 per cent per 
  year, whereas Malawi, currently the least urbanized, has estimated urban growth 
  rates of over 6 per cent per year (UNCHS 2001a). South Africa has the biggest 
  and most numerous urban areas in the sub-region, including Southern Africa's 
  largest urban agglomeration, Johannesburg (population approximately 4 million, 
  791 000 households, area 1384 km<sup>2</sup>, 720 suburbs) (UNCHS & UNEP 1997, 
  GJMC 1999).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The high urbanization rates in Southern Africa are due to rural-urban migration 
  and high population growth rates. Migration is a result of the pull factors 
  of urban settlements-such as perceived job opportunities, and better infrastructure 
  and housing-in addition to 'push factors' from rural areas such as shortage 
  of land and declining returns from agriculture. In Angola and Mozambique, urbanization 
  has been driven largely by civil conflict which forced many rural residents 
  to flee to relatively safer urban areas. About 4.5 million Mozambicans were 
  displaced to urban areas during the 1980s (Chenje 2000).</p>
<p>Despite considerable economic development and employment opportunities in Southern 
  Africa's urban centres, the rate of population growth and urban migration has 
  exceeded the ability to create jobs and raise standards of living for urban 
  residents. However, the informal sector has grown rapidly in urban areas, and 
  many cities now have considerable hidden economies. One such informal activity 
  is urban agriculture. Mainly instituted at the subsistence level to counteract 
  low levels of employment and income, urban agriculture has become an integral 
  part of the urban economy for the poor. Up to 37 per cent of urban households 
  in Mozambique were engaged in subsistence agriculture in 1996, and 45 per cent 
  of low-income urban households in Zambia grew crops or raised livestock (UNDP 
  1996).</p>
<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The rapid growth and expansion of urban areas in Southern Africa are causing 
  an unprecedented level of localized depletion of natural resources, discharge 
  of unprocessed wastes into the environment and massive demands for urban services. 
  Most Southern African municipalities have not been able to keep pace with the 
  demand for basic services such as housing, roads, piped water, sanitation and 
  waste disposal. Provision of health and education services and facilities has 
  also lagged far behind urban population growth. The overall result is that the 
  environment has become hazardous to human health through rapid spread of water-borne 
  and respiratory diseases, and this situation is compounded by a lack of health 
  facilities, low levels of education and employment opportunities and, hence, 
  a reduced ability to afford improvements to living conditions.</p>
