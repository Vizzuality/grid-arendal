<h4><i>Urban areas</i></h4>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, both the proportion of people living in urban 
  areas and the rate of growth of urban populations increase, as does the number 
  of cities in Africa with populations greater than one million people. The growth 
  in urban populations is driven mainly by the migration of people from rural 
  areas, who come to the towns in order to seek employment and opportunities for 
  a life outside agriculture. A disproportionate number of immigrants are men-mostly 
  young adults. The rate of urban population growth initially outstrips the capacity 
  of the municipal and central government authorities to provide the necessary 
  services and infrastructure, so that the number of slums and unplanned peri-urban 
  settlements increases.</p>
<p>These changes have generally negative effects on the environment in the vicinity 
  of towns, which provides fuelwood for the increasing numbers of urban poor. 
  In terms of air, water and waste pollution, many urban environments become degraded, 
  although environmental quality does improve in a few of the wealthier cities. 
  The generally negative effects of urbanization are offset, to some extent, by 
  some positive changes. As the cities grow, the proportion of the population 
  with access to electricity, piped water and sanitation also increases, and water 
  management services become more effective. Over time, these positive effects 
  on the environment are further enhanced by a marginal decline in the proportion 
  of the population living in poverty in slums and other unplanned settlements.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Central 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The development of cities continues unabated as farmers continue to migrate 
  from rural areas. The private sector occupies a vital place in the urban management 
  process. The problems of revamping continue unabated.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Eastern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>There is steady urban growth, but this is planned and the quality of services 
  for the urban dwellers is improved. Industrial emissions and discharges are 
  controlled through regulations, and by industries being located away from major 
  settlements and sensitive ecosystems. Urban authorities are given adequate capital 
  through streamlined revenue collection systems, and are able to deliver improved 
  services including, refuse collection and street lighting. There is more private 
  sector involvement in the provision of services in urban areas.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, some of the largest cities in Northern Africa 
  are expected to grow larger. The consequence of this is that many resources 
  and services become very stretched to satisfy increasing demands. Large numbers 
  of people are deprived of basic services, such as safe water, sanitation and 
  power supply. Air pollution from the large numbers of vehicles in congested 
  cities reaches alarming levels. However, appropriate attention and good measures 
  are taken to reduce the problem. The large volumes of solid waste generated 
  in urban areas overburden the municipalities, which are responsible for managing 
  such waste. Improper incineration of solid waste adds to the problem of air 
  pollution.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, the explosive rural-urban migration-which is 
  associated with locating industries, educational and health facilities in the 
  cities-is controlled. With huge commercial farms, cooperatives and agro-industrial 
  plants situated in rural areas, pressures in the urban centres are reduced. 
  Some industrial plants are actually relocated from major urban centres to locations 
  formally considered to be 'countryside'. Urban authorities continue to encourage 
  the cooperation of business and communities to clean up, repair or construct 
  facilities to create a safer urban environment. Competition begins to show signs 
  of renewal.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>West 
  Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Urban areas become the living quarters of the poor: overcrowded, polluted, 
  and with ever fewer jobs and services-the seat of misery and disease. The richer 
  classes move to the deserted countryside, living off foreign earnings and the 
  sale of land to wealthy immigrants. Town planning and maintenance are restricted 
  to the few multinational commercial areas, leaving the rest with poor water, 
  sanitation, pollution, overcrowding, potholed roads, crime and destitution. 
  Coastal areas and the countryside become the soughtafter areas for commercial 
  immigrants and retired people with fixed incomes from abroad. This forces up 
  land prices and drives the indigenous population into the squatter areas of 
  towns, whose infrastructure fails to keep pace with the growth of the population.</p>
