<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY </h3>
<p>As a result of pressures to increase production: marginal land is being brought 
  under cultivation or grazing; fertilizers and pesticides are widely used by 
  commercial operations (although applications of organic matter in small-scale 
  practices is declining); and fallow periods are being reduced. These activities, 
  although designed to increase productivity, can result in exhaustion of the 
  production capacity of the land, manifested as: declining yields; vegetation 
  and soil degradation and loss; and, in extreme cases, desertification. Climatic 
  variability and change, and inappropriate land use or land tenure policies, 
  add to the pressures and magnify the impacts. The current situation is that 
  approximately 22 per cent of vegetated land in the region (494 million ha) has 
  been classified as degraded, and 66 per cent of this are classified as moderately, 
  severely or extremely degraded (UNU 1998). Africa is not unique in experiencing 
  this problem, as shown in <a href="#fig2f4">Figure 2f.4</a>, but the effects 
  on food security and the anticipated impacts of climate change make land degradation 
  a priority issue for African leaders.</p>

<p><a name="fig2f4"></a>Land degradation and reduced productivity can be categorized 
  as: hydrological and chemical degradation; physical degradation; or biological 
  degradation. Hydrological and chemical degradation encompasses: waterlogging; 
  salinization; sodication; and chemical pollution. It is caused by the use of 
  low quality water for irrigation, and environmental pollution. Chemical degradation-resulting 
  from pollution from industrial, household and medical refuse, and mining wastes-also 
  occurs in selected sites. Physical degradation includes deterioration of soil 
  structure and the occurrence of compacted layers, and can be due to: overstocking; 
  inappropriate use of machinery; mining and quarrying activities; frequent waterlogging; 
  and exposure to erosion. Biological degradation refers to the loss of nutrients 
  and micro-organisms vital for maintaining healthy productive crops, and is due 
  to the exhaustion of soil fertility, as a result of: intensive cropping; removal 
  of crop residues; nutrient deficiencies; and insufficient organic matter.</p>
<p>The causes of land degradation in Africa are climatic variability and management 
  practices, in addition to physical factors, such as the slope of the land and 
  soil structure. Although most often associated with cultivation or grazing areas, 
  degradation can also affect: forests, woodlands and savannas; urban and peri-urban 
  areas; and protected areas. For example, clearance of forest vegetation (by 
  fire, drought or overgrazing, or for alternative land uses) leaves soils more 
  susceptible to erosion by wind and rain, especially when on steep slopes, in 
  high rainfall zones or when combined with poor management, such as over-grazing. 
  Draining of wetlands (for cultivation or urban development) disrupts the hydrological 
  cycle and renders the surrounding areas more prone to flooding, and may no longer 
  provide suitable habitat for wildlife, or raw materials for construction and 
  crafts. Conversion of natural habitats to cultivation or grazing in unsuitable 
  areas can also set off negative feedback systems of degradation, as detailed 
  in <a href="#box2f1">Box 2f.1</a></p>

            <p>In traditional agro-pastoral systems, when land productivity declined 
              through overcultivation or overgrazing, the farmers shifted to a 
              new area whilst the former area recovered. However, with increasing 
              population and economic pressures, production systems have changed, 
              and the rate of conversion of natural habitat is faster. The rate 
              of degradation is also faster, because inputs are minimized and 
              fallow periods are reduced, in order to maximize production over 
              the short term. The overall result is that more land is brought 
              under grazing or cultivation, in order to counteract losses due 
              to degradation. This impacts on natural habitats, biodiversity and 
              ecological functioning, and means that food production requirements 
              are not met.</p>
            <p>Certain techniques have all been used successfully to improve productivity 
              and over the long term, whilst maintaining a health resource base. 
              These techniques include: crop rotation; increasing crop diversity; 
              using livestock manure and crop residues as fertilizers; the construction 
              of windbreaks; and agroforestry</p>

<p>Over the past 30 years, soil structure has been damaged, nutrients have been 
  depleted and susceptibility to erosion has been increased, as a result of: increasing 
  application of chemicals; use of inappropriate equipment and technologies; and 
  commercial mono-specific plantations. Irrigation in areas of high evaporation, 
  and by inappropriate technologies, for example, increases the rate of salinization 
  of the soil, because the water is rapidly lost, leaving behind a crust of once-dissolved 
  salts. Likewise, intense grazing, especially in marginal areas and by a single 
  species of livestock, can degrade vegetation, and can lead to soil compaction 
  and accelerated erosion. One study found that most soil degradation in Africa 
  was attributable to overgrazing (50 per cent), followed by: poor agricultural 
  management practices (24 per cent); vegetation removal (14 per cent); and overexploitation 
  (13 per cent) (WRI 1992). Between 1980 and 1995, Africa's permanent pasture 
  declined slightly, indicating either conversion to cultivation, or abandonment 
  due to extreme degradation, or a combination of both (UNU 1998).</p>
