<h3>WATER QUALITY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Freshwater resources in southern Africa are also under pressure from pollution, 
  and water quality is a growing problem, particularly in urban areas and close 
  to industrial centres. Inadequate sewage treatment and disposal facilities are 
  the main causes of urban water pollution, resulting in localized incidences 
  of high faecal coliform counts. In the Victoria Falls town in Zimbabwe, for 
  example, faecal coliform counts were found to be 350 times the level in unpolluted 
  water (Feresu and van Sickle 1990). Khami Dam, near the city of Bulawayo, receives 
  a daily discharge of up to 700 m<sup>3</sup> of effluent (Chenje 2000). These 
  bacteria cause intestinal infections and diarrhoeal epidemics, if allowed into 
  drinking water supplies. Diarrhoea is one of the main causes of death in Africa, 
  particularly among children, and the main causes of diarrhoea are poor water 
  quality and sanitation. Contamination of water supplies also creates problems 
  for irrigation and industrial uses, requiring additional processing, which is 
  expensive.</p>
<p>Agricultural run-off is causing accumulation of excess nutrients, such as phosphates 
  and nitrates, in water bodies (eutrophication), as well as sedimentation. This 
  changes the composition and functioning of the natural biota; makes the environment 
  less attractive for recreation and sport; releases toxic metabolites, and taste 
  and odour-causing compounds; and complicates water treatment. In 1996, Lake 
  Chivero, near Harare, experienced algal blooms, infestations of water hyacinth 
  and fish deaths, as a result of high levels of ammonia and low levels of oxygen 
  in the lake (Gumbo 1997). The most likely sources of contaminants are: sewage 
  from nearby settlements; agricultural run-off; and industrial discharges (Gumbo 
  1997). The Kafue River in Zambia is the recipient of almost all of the 93 000 
  tonnes (t) of waste from mining, chemical, fertilizer and textile industries 
  (Chenje 2000). Mining activities also contribute to declining water quality 
  and degradation of freshwater habitats. The rivers in Greater Soweto, for example, 
  are heavily polluted by mining drainage water, and show evidence of low pH values, 
  high electrical conductivity and high sulphate values (GJMC 1999). A further 
  source of pollution is from solid waste which has not been properly disposed 
  of, from which pollutants are leached into surface and groundwater. Metals and 
  batteries were found to be prevalent in solid wastes from the town of Kariba, 
  constituting a major input of metals and heavy metals into the Zambezi River 
  (Chenje 2000).</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>The heads of state of the southern African countries recently made a decision 
  to bring forces together, in order to develop a holistic regional strategic 
  approach to IWRM and development in the region. This resulted in the formulation 
  of the Regional Strategic Action Plan in 1997, and represents a significant 
  commitment towards meeting the challenge of providing adequate water service 
  and supply in the sub-region, as well as protection of the environment. The 
  Regional Strategic Action Plan reaffirms the importance of the sub-region's 
  water resources, and its influences on all aspects of the region's economic 
  and social performance. Other initiatives that have occurred in the sub-region 
  in the water sector, in a bid to achieve regional integration, include the Water 
  Weeks, instituted by SADC. The Water Weeks comprise a series of national workshops 
  aimed at informing key stakeholders about SADC-wide water initiatives, and to 
  involve them in discussions about the implementation of these initiatives.</p>
<p>Effluent water standards have been established and implemented in South Africa 
  and Namibia, as measures to control water quality. In South Africa, in addition 
  to a General Effluent Standard, there is a Special Effluent Standard, designed 
  to protect mountain streams that can support trout (Water Act 54 of 1956). A 
  National River Health Programme has also been implemented, in order to provide 
  regularly updated information on the biological health of river systems in South 
  Africa, and to provide recommendations for IWRM at the catchment level. The 
  National River Health Programme is also responsible for a series of 'State of 
  the Rivers' reports, which present the information in a user-friendly manner.</p>
