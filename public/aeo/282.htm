<h4><i>Forests</i></h4>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Africa</i></p>
<p>The historical trend of deforestation and degradation of forest areas continues, 
  as a result both of the need for more land for human settlement and agriculture, 
  and of the drive to exploit forest resources (mainly timber) to boost export 
  earnings. The rate of deforestation and land conversion, however, slows down, 
  due to afforestation, decreasing forest exploitation in many parts of Africa 
  and the gradual implementation of existing conventions to use forests in a sustainable 
  manner. The increase in ecotourism provides additional incentives to conserve 
  forests, though this is offset to some extent by the increase in land pressures. 
  In order to secure the future of forested areas, as well as to spread the benefits 
  of their conservation more widely, communities living in the forests and surrounding 
  areas are encouraged to take part in their management, sustained use and conservation. 
  This, too, contributes to slowing down the rate of deforestation.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Central 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Trade liberalization, with appropriate technologies, improves the quality of 
  logging. The industrial and artisan exploitation of wood increases the pressure 
  on forest resources, and sparks off the potential of this sub-region for deforestation 
  The strategies to protect the forest, and rational management of forest resources, 
  are difficult to apply, in spite of the number of conventions and initiatives 
  developed to this effect.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Eastern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The forest sector plays a major role, especially in the growing construction 
  industry. Private-sector interest in forestry grows, and most of the plantations 
  are privatized for proper management and profitability. The government focuses 
  more on the protection of forests, where activities are strictly regulated, 
  thus improving the quality of these forests.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Although the forests in Northern Africa are quite limited, the role they play 
  in stabilizing the sand dunes and providing some quality products, such as gum 
  arabic, cannot be neglected. Unfortunately, the high deforestation rate currently 
  experienced in this subregion continues, albeit at a slightly lower rate. On 
  the one hand, as the population increases and demand for resources increases 
  alongside it, forests continue to be used as a source of fuelwood and charcoal. 
  On the other hand, natural disasters-such as fires and severe droughts-also 
  take their toll on forests. Despite the acknowledgement of the deforestation 
  problem by governments, the pressures mentioned above outweigh the afforestation 
  and reforestation efforts.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The threat to forests comes with huge commercial farming and massive agro-industrial 
  complexes. The forests have already been experiencing losses, which were not 
  adequately compensated through reforestation. In the Market Forces scenario, 
  the competition of market forces rejuvenates interest in, and compels, reforestation 
  and afforestation. Environment-sensitive investment policies help competing 
  investors to make concern about the forests part of their plans.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>West 
  Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Forests, including those currently protected, become decimated as the local 
  commercial value of wood for fuel and other uses exceeds the political will 
  to protect it. Another impact is that environmental NGOs get bought out by commercial 
  interests, and dismantled by increasingly right-wing central governments.</p>
