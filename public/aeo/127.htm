<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUE OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS </h3>
<p>Forests and woodlands are remarkable ecosystems. They have high productivity 
  rates-over 800 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr in moist tropical forests (WCMC 2000)-and support rich 
  and diverse animal and plant communities that, together, provide resources and 
  opportunities sustaining livelihoods and commercial operations.</p>
<p>Forests and woodlands provide resources and environmental services at global, 
  regional and local levels. At the global level, evapotranspiration and cloud 
  cover over tropical rain forests play a role in maintaining a thermal balance 
  in the earth's atmosphere. Forests also filter out pollution and are a sink 
  for atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus helping to mitigate global climate change. 
  Loss of forests and woodlands can contribute to local and perhaps regional climate 
  variability (BSP 1992, Laurance 1998, IPCC 1998) because, when forest is cleared, 
  both the albedo (proportion of solar radiation which is reflected by the earth's 
  surface) and local temperatures rise.</p>

      <p>It is estimated that about 50 per cent of the precipitation in the Amazon 
        basin originates from evapotranspiration; the proportion of rainfall recycled 
        in Central Africa may be as high as 75 to 95 per cent. Clearing of tropical 
        forests is implicated in reductions in local rainfall in many areas, including 
        Côte d'Ivoire and the Gambia</p>

<p>Clearing of forests can affect evapotranspiration and hydrological cycles because 
  trees (and especially trees in tropical rainforests) recycle much of the rainwater 
  that falls over an area. It is estimated that about 50 per cent of the precipitation 
  in the Amazon basin originates from evapotranspiration; the proportion of rainfall 
  recycled in Central Africa may be as high as 75 to 95 per cent (BSP 1992, Laurance 
  1998). Clearing of tropical forests is implicated in reductions in local rainfall 
  in many areas, including Côte d'Ivoire and the Gambia (Park 1992, WCMC 1992). 
  Deforestation can also set off a chain of events that can result in intensified 
  droughts affecting areas in other regions or sub-regions that might be more 
  vulnerable to an increase in dry spells. For example, it has been argued that 
  the prolonged droughts affecting the Sahelian areas of Northern Africa are caused, 
  in part, by the destruction of forests in Western Africa (Park 1992).</p>

            <p>A study from Masoala National Park in Madagascar, showed that the 
              value of forest products sustainably harvested by the local villagers 
              could be as much as US$200 000 over 10 years. By comparison, the 
              income that could be earned over the same period through slash-and-burn 
              agriculture was estimated at only US$12 000. However,Madagascar 
              could earn a total of US$90 million in foreign trade by selling 
              the timber from the forest. When the researchers included the value 
              of the forest in terms of global climate regulation, preserving 
              the forest could save twice this amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="box2d1"></a>Forests and woodlands also regulate soil and water quality, 
  protecting the soil from erosion and contributing to its fertility, intercepting 
  rainfall and channelling run-off, and maintaining the balance of elements and 
  nutrients in the air, soil, water, and organisms. They prevent silting of water 
  downstream, and control the drought-flood cycles in rivers. Major hydroelectric 
  schemes can suffer if these phenomena are disrupted, resulting in a lower capacity 
  for power generation that can affect industries and their ability to provide 
  employment.</p>
<p>The destruction of forests upstream of mangrove forests can harm the mangroves 
  by causing increased sediment loads in rivers, and by contributing to global 
  warming (Wass 1995). In coastal areas, mangrove forests protect coastlines and 
  riverbanks by stabilizing sediments and controlling erosion. They also absorb 
  the impact of waves and of storm floods, regulate salt intrusion inland and 
  trap sand preventing its moving onto the land behind beaches. In addition, mangrove 
  forests protect coral reefs and beaches, absorb pollution from the ocean and 
  provide a habitat for many species of commercial fish.</p>
<p>The value of all of these 'ecosystem functions' is not easy to estimate in 
  monetary terms. Furthermore, the benefits accrue to the global community and 
  not only to local communities or users of forest resources. There is now increasing 
  recognition of their importance and of these functions and of the need to harvest 
  forest products on a sustainable basis in order to maintain them (FAO 1999). 
  A recent study of forests in Madagascar has highlighted both the short-term 
  and long-term values of different uses of forests, as detailed in <a href="#box2d1">Box 
  2d.1</a>.</p>
