<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Climate variability is common throughout Africa and it is increasingly limiting 
  development. Extremes of rainfall are the most damaging aspect of climate variability 
  and Africa frequently suffers the devastating impacts of floods and drought. 
  Lives, livelihoods, crops, livestock and infrastructure are lost during these 
  events and the financial cost is well beyond the means of African countries, 
  meaning that they are neither prepared for such events nor able to afford to 
  repair the damage caused. It is the poor who are the most vulnerable as they 
  have no alternative source of income to their direct, subsistence level dependence 
  on natural resources (either through cultivation, livestock rearing, or harvesting 
  resources from natural habitats). Most countries have developed and implemented 
  strategies for coping with climate variability, including ratification of the 
  UNCCD, and development of National Action Plans. There are also effective climate 
  and hazard monitoring programmes and early warning systems in many sub-regions. 
  However, given the additional impacts of climate change, these systems may need 
  additional trained staff, financial resources and equipment. The main priorities 
  for action are therefore to strengthen coping strategies for effective management 
  of the impacts of extreme events, increase food security, and maintain healthy 
  ecosystems.</p>

<p>Africa's limited economic and infrastructure resources for mitigating or coping 
  with shifting patterns of food production, increased frequency and severity 
  of natural disasters and rising seal levels make the region one of the most 
  vulnerable to climate change. Although many African countries have ratified 
  the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, most countries (with the exception of those 
  of Northern Africa and South Africa) have negligible GHG emissions. Developing 
  countries such as those in Africa stand to gain from the proposed mechanisms 
  for emissions trading, reforestation schemes, and cleaner development. Emphasis 
  in the global arena should therefore be placed on their implementation as soon 
  as possible, to assist in meeting development objectives through sound environmental 
  management.</p>
<p>Above all, it is critical that action be taken immediately. Further delays 
  in curbing the trend of increasing atmospheric pollution will only add to the 
  uncertainties and insecurities that natural climate variability causes. Developing 
  countries also need to invest in disaster preparedness strategies in the short 
  term, and to diversify their economies away from the heavy dependence on agriculture 
  in the long term.</p>
<p>Ambient air pollution, particularly in urban centres, is emerging as an issue 
  of concern for human health in many African countries. Increasing levels of 
  toxic pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead, and particulates 
  are a result of industrial emissions and vehicle exhausts (particularly from 
  older vehicles) as well as burning of coal, wood, or other fuels to meet domestic 
  energy requirements. Population growth over the past 30 years has increased 
  the demand for energy and industrialization, thus raising emissions of pollutants. 
  Population growth and the pattern of human settlements have also put pressure 
  on transport systems, increasing vehicle exhaust emissions. Radical changes 
  in technology are required if economic development is to proceed without adding 
  to the existing environmental challenges and if stringent emission controls 
  are to be avoided. Removal of subsidies, expansion of electrification programmes, 
  promotion of unleaded fuels, and conversion to cleaner fuels are measures that 
  have been implemented successfully in parts of Africa recently. In particular 
  the energy industry, manufacturing industries, and transport systems will have 
  to undergo fundamental changes in order to supply sustainable energy, material 
  and mobility to future generations.</p>
