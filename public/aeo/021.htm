<h3>CONFLICT PREVENTION AND PEACE-BUILDING</h3>
<p>Despite making some noticeable efforts towards progress in the region, setbacks 
  have also been encountered during the past decade. Wars in countries such as 
  Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia-Eritrea and the Democratic Republic 
  of Congo have not only led to a resurgence of the serious problems of refugees, 
  but also to the plunder of natural resources. The United Nations (UN) has produced 
  a number of reports on this issue, and some countries have been sanctioned over 
  the trade in illegal diamonds and other minerals and natural resources.</p>
<p>African countries have taken bold steps in solving conflicts themselves at 
  a regional level. For instance, the sub-regional defence bloc for West Africa, 
  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), 
  has been instrumental in bringing peace to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Elsewhere 
  in the region, there are similar bodies that are entrusted with sub-regional 
  security, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on 
  Politics, Defence and Security.</p>

<h3><a name="fig13"></a>SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES</h3>
<p>The 1990s were also characterized by state involvement in the shift towards 
  a market economy in Africa. This is the decade when many African countries liberalized 
  their economies. Privatization of state-owned infrastructure was introduced 
  in many countries. There were mixed results but, overall, job losses were evident 
  in those countries. <a href="#fig13">Figure 1.3</a> illustrates Africa's economic 
  performance between 1965 and 2000.</p>
<h4>Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)</h4>
<p>During the past decade, many African countries continued with economic reform 
  through SAPs. While economic liberalization may have triggered economic recovery, 
  there have been indications that economic growth will worsen, as opposed to 
  improving, environmental conditions (UNDP/UNEP/World Bank/ WRI 1996). The general 
  trend between 1995 and 1998 shows a declining economic situation, with GNP per 
  capita falling. Indications, however, reveal that, in some countries of the 
  region, the economy may have started to pick up again. According to the World 
  Bank, only nine out of 48 countries have annual per capita income of more than 
  US$l 000, and only five countries in the region-Botswana, Gabon, Mauritius, 
  Seychelles and South Africa-have annual per capita levels of more than US$2 
  500 (Kappel 2001).</p>
