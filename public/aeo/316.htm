<h2>DISCUSSIONS AND SYNTHESIS</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Humankind has, through the ages, employed various methods and devices to seek 
  to know what the future holds. Indeed, there is a school of thought that humanity's 
  concern with knowing the future, and the impulse to propitiate the future in 
  order to avoid catastrophes and to produce blessings, may well have been part 
  of the drive for knowledge. Be that as it may, any explorations about the future 
  remain a major undertaking, and one which is designed to elucidate and educate. 
  It is even more challenging when the subject of study concerns humanity in its 
  domain, and humanity's ability to ensure self-preservation.</p>
<p>In our endeavour to chart a new course for the development of the African environment, 
  we have made recourse to all the tools available at our disposal. For instance, 
  as Achebe and others (1990) wrote in Beyond Hunger, 'thinking about the future 
  requires faith and vision, mixed with philosophical detachment, a rich emotional 
  life and creative fantasy as well as the rigorous and orderly tools of science'. 
  Consequently, in looking at the future of Africa from 2002 to 2032, we have 
  combined all these efforts to produce quantitative descriptions and rich narratives 
  of the various scenarios, which we believe will assist in the major steps that 
  must be taken in the new millennium.</p>
<p>AMCEN's concern with developing an AEO represents a significant landmark in 
  the region's development process. It should also constitute a threshold in the 
  way in which we relate to the environment. It is this understanding that constitutes 
  the framework for the analysis described in this chapter. The four scenarios-the 
  Market Forces scenario, the Policy Reform scenario, the Fortress World scenario 
  and the Great Transitions scenario-were developed to facilitate the discussions 
  on the future of our environment. The scenarios are simple conceptualizations 
  of how the environment might develop in the next 30 years. The truth is that 
  this categorization is convenient, and is not meant to indicate some compartmentalization 
  of the processes of change. As we have shown in the narratives, it is possible, 
  even within countries, to find aspects of each scenario occurring. The Fortress 
  World scenario- though a doomsday scenario, which is heralded by apathy and 
  the neglect of issues of sustainability-has many features that are present today 
  in the socioeconomic systems of many African countries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, writing about the future can be one of the most dangerous undertakings, 
  because the future is essentially unknown and uncertain. It can also be a very 
  challenging task, because it can be full of suspense and surprises. This is 
  our understanding. What we have provided in this work, therefore, is both the 
  quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the future of our region, in the 
  hope that the minds of people in positions of authority, who can make and execute 
  policies, are drawn to the crucial issues raised regarding desirable and undesirable 
  trends. In this final section, we shall attempt a recapitulation of the findings.</p>
