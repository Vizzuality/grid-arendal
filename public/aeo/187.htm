<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h3>
<p>The heavy pressures on land in the sub-region have resulted in: the degradation 
  of, or the conversion of, natural vegetation; clearing of forests; loss of productivity; 
  and soil erosion. Deforestation rates are high, because land is cleared for 
  commercial cultivation, as well as for urban and industrial developments. This 
  exposes the soil to wind and water erosion, and alters the capacity to regulate 
  soil and water quality, flow regulation and flooding control. The rainforest 
  area of Madagascar, for example, is experiencing escalating rates of clearance 
  for cultivation and cattle rearing. Intense grazing pressures are, in turn, 
  affecting areas of grassland and permanent pastures, leading to: loss of vegetation 
  cover; soil compaction; and erosion.</p>
<p>Lack of erosion control techniques, exacerbated by frequent, severe tropical 
  cyclones, leaves the soils exposed and vulnerable to extensive erosion (World 
  Bank 1995). The central highlands of Madagascar have been classified as 'hotspots' 
  of soil erosion, due to intense pressures from low-input agriculture and, in 
  the southwest of the country, shortening of fallow periods has caused nutrient 
  depletion of the soils, rendering them more vulnerable to the impacts of drought 
  (UNEP 1999b). In Comoros, soil fertility has declined and soil structure has 
  deteriorated, such that enormous soil losses are experienced with each monsoon 
  (UNEP 1998). In Reunion, the steep sides of the volcano have been cleared of 
  vegetation, and they experience highly erosive rainfall, resulting in landslides, 
  which are effective barriers to sustainable agriculture. In these small islands, 
  the coastal zone is greatly threatened by soil losses of this magnitude, because 
  sediments which are washed out to sea smother fragile and economically important 
  habitats, such as coral reefs and mangroves. This is a serious problem in the 
  Seychelles (Shah 1997), where additional coastal erosion occurs due to wave 
  action and sea level rise. Land reclamation projects in Seychelles have produced 
  200 ha, with a further 395 ha under development, despite damage to the coral 
  (Shah 1997).</p>

<p><a name="img2f5"></a>Rates of soil loss, and the economic impacts of this, 
  have not been quantified for this sub-region, but it has been estimated that, 
  in Madagascar, approximately 45 per cent of the land is under moderate, high 
  or very high risk of desertification. This follows the general pattern seen 
  in Africa of highest vulnerability in areas of low-input agriculture combined 
  with high population, or along desert margins (Reich and others 2001). Madagascar's 
  National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) places the costs of land degradation 
  at 15 per cent of GDP, or US$290 million (USAID 1988). This was mostly attributed 
  to deforestation, although soil erosion was estimated to cost between US$4.9 
  million and US$7.6 million in any particular year. The costs included: reductions 
  in agricultural productivity; raised infrastructure maintenance and investment 
  costs; and damage to coastal ecosystems (USAID 1988). Whilst this was a small 
  fraction of agricultural GDP that year, the cumulative costs of soil degradation 
  over time could be significantly higher, as shown by estimates from other countries 
  (UNU 1998).</p>
<p>A further issue of concern, particularly in Mauritius, is the extensive use 
  of inorganic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides in commercial sugar plantations. 
  Average annual fertilizer applications have been estimated at 600 kg/ha, more 
  than five times the world average of 113 kg/ha (Government of Mauritius 1991, 
  WRI, UNDP, UNEP and World Bank 1998). This excessive exposure to agrochemicals 
  poses a health risk for farmworkers, and run-off reaching rivers and coastal 
  waters is poisoning wildlife and contributing to eutrophication (UNEP 1999b).</p>
<h4>Improving land quality and productivity in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>Climate change and increasing populations (both resident and tourist) are likely 
  to increase the pressures on land resources, in order to meet the growing demand 
  for food amid more variable climatic conditions. In response, all countries 
  in the sub-region have ratified the UNCCD, although none of the countries have 
  yet produced National Action Plans. Madagascar, the country most affected by 
  drought, organized a National Awareness Seminar in 1997, and has established 
  a national focal point for coordinating the National Action Plan (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>All countries have also produced NEAPs, in addition to a Regional Environment 
  Programme coordinated by the Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius (IOC). Each 
  of these contains action programmes to combat degradation, and implementation 
  is well underway in Madagascar and Mauritius. In Madagascar, environmental awareness 
  has increased since adoption of a national conservation strategy in 1984, and 
  several successful conservation schemes have been completed. The NEAP complements 
  these activities by focusing on: biodiversity protection and management; the 
  creation of a national environmental fund for environmental improvement projects; 
  additional research, including land mapping and management; environmental education 
  and training; and institutional support. </p>
