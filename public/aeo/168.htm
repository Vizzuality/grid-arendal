<h3>WATER QUALITY IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Rising levels of pollution of surface and groundwater resources in the sub-region 
  compounds inadequate access to freshwater. The primary sources of pollution 
  are sewage and industrial effluents. Agricultural run-off is an additional burden, 
  through contamination with chemical residues and silt, and increased nutrient 
  levels. This is particularly noticeable in the coastal areas of western Africa, 
  where most industries and commercial agricultural plantations are located. Coastal 
  wetlands, which are particularly sensitive to pollutants, are experiencing severe 
  degradation. The Korle lagoon in Accra, Ghana, for example, is one of the most 
  heavily polluted wetlands in western Africa, receiving effluents from solid 
  waste dumps, industries, sewage outfalls, and agricultural run-off. Effluents 
  washed out to sea are also having a negative impact on coastal and marine habitats, 
  and are posing a health risk to humans (IDRC 1996). In recent years, 36 wetlands 
  in western Africa have been designated as Wetlands of International Importance 
  under the 1971 Ramsar Convention, including six sites in Ghana and six in Guinea 
  (Ramsar 2001).</p>
<p>Degradation of water quality inland also creates problems for domestic, industrial 
  and agricultural users. In Yeumbeul, Senegal, 7 000 households are dependent 
  on a groundwater source that was recently found to harbour nitrate concentrations 
  well above WHO's guideline of 50 mg/l. Two sources of contamination were identified, 
  namely: shallow nearby latrines; and waste organic matter carried in groundwater 
  (Tandia, Diop and Gaye 1999). Diarrhoea, ascariasis (roundworm), dracunculiasis 
  (guinea worm) and schistosomiasis (bilharzia) are among the most prevalent waterborne 
  diseases, and are associated with standing water, and lack of safe drinking 
  water and sanitation.</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in Western Africa</h4>
<p>The Africa 2000 initiative of the WHO Africa Regional Office has seen considerable 
  gains in water supply and sanitation in western Africa. For example, in Ghana, 
  Drinking Water Quality Guidelines are the same as WHO guidelines, and disinfection 
  of drinking water has 100 per cent coverage in Accra. A new policy on water 
  and sanitation provision, introduced in 1993, encourages user communities to 
  become more selfreliant, especially in rural areas, where the provision of services 
  is through community ownership and management of the facilities. In Mauritania, 
  gains under the Africa 2000 initiative include: a research programme to optimize 
  water treatment with the use of appropriate technology; and training of water 
  treatment plant operation and maintenance technicians. Training of hygiene workers 
  in water quality analysis, and the promotion of a hygiene education programme 
  in villages, schools and urban areas, has resulted in several latrines being 
  built in schools and individual households.</p>
<p>A number of Western African countries are members of the African Union of Water 
  Distributors, namely: Benin; Burkina Faso; Côte d'Ivoire; Ghana; Guinea; Liberia; 
  Mali; Mauritania; Niger; Senegal; and Togo. The African Union of Water Distributors 
  has been instrumental in improving water exploitation, distribution and pricing 
  among member states. Western African states have also formed a water research 
  organization, the Inter-African Committee for Hydrology Studies, based in Ouagadougou. 
  This committee deals with extension work to spread new technologies and information 
  concerning water in Africa (Biémi 1996).</p>
<p>Countries of western Africa would benefit from developing and enforcing effective 
  water pollution prevention and control programmes which combine strategies for 
  reducing pollution at source, prior to EIAs of new developments. Criteria for 
  monitoring the biological, physical and chemical quality of water bodies need 
  to be established, and mechanisms need to be put in place to address deviations 
  from standards. Above all, water resources require integrated management, with 
  the participation of all stakeholders in decision making and management, and 
  with the inclusion of the environment as a legitimate water user. International 
  water-quality monitoring and management programmes-such as the Global Water 
  Quality Monitoring Programme, the UNEP Environmentally Sound Management of Inland 
  Waters and the Food and Agriculture (FAO) Regional Inland Fishery Bodies-provide 
  support and coordination for such activities.</p>
