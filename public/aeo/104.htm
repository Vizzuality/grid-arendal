<p><a name="img2c4"></a>All countries in Northern Africa are party to either the 
  Barcelona Convention or the Jeddah Convention (both in the case of Egypt). The 
  objectives of the Barcelona Convention, which came into force in 1978, are to 
  achieve international cooperation for a coordinated approach to protection and 
  enhancement of the marine environment and coastal zone of the Mediterranean. 
  The Jeddah Convention came into force in 1985 and sets similar objectives for 
  the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. These conventions and the strategies in their 
  associated Action Plans have set the background for development of ICZM at the 
  national level.</p>
<p>In Egypt, an ICZM strategy has been developed by the Egyptian Environmental 
  Affairs Agency and is being prepared for distribution and implementation. A 
  National Environmental Sustainable Tourism Strategy is also being developed 
  and pilot-scale implementation is under way in the Red Sea. Egypt has also signed 
  all regional and international agreements regarding the protection of seas and 
  coastal zones, and a number of ecotourism projects for the Red Sea and the Mediterranean 
  Sea are attempting to implement the principles of sustainable coastal development 
  (CSD 1999).</p>
<p>In Morocco, protection of the coastal and marine environments is under the 
  joint responsibility of the Ministries of Services (ports) Transport and Shipping, 
  Environment, and the Interior. These ministries are responsible for compliance 
  with regulations on environmental impact assessments and pollution and wastes, 
  especially agricultural effluents, sewage, and flushing of ballast waters. The 
  Ministry of Fisheries has jurisdiction over harvesting of marine and coastal 
  resources and is responsible for ensuring sustainable use of these resources. 
  There are also measures in place to ensure coordination between these organizations, 
  including the National Emergency Plan for dealing with environmental accidents 
  (1996), the National Environment Council, and the Inter-ministerial Committee 
  for Coastal Tourism (CSD 1999).</p>
<p>Tunisia has ratified the MARPOL Convention and has established a national plan 
  for dealing with emergencies and accidents. Projects are also underway to monitor 
  and rehabilitate marine fish stocks, to establish and enforce water quality 
  guidelines, and to protect against pollution by hydrocarbons from oil processing 
  and transport activities, giving force to the policy on sustainable use of marine 
  resources.</p>
