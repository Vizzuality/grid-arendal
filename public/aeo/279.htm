<p>Overexploitation leads to the incidence of soil erosion. Access to land is 
  reserved for people who hold the means of production, thus breeding the genesis 
  of land tenure-based conflicts.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>The pressure on land is relieved by a thriving industrial sector, which creates 
  employment and takes most people away from the land (farming). Commercial farming 
  becomes more dominant, with measures taken to sustain productivity on the land. 
  Such measures include soil erosion control and fertility enhancement. A functional 
  land market makes it possible for individuals with capital to invest in land 
  or to buy land from those unable to utilize it.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>The pressure on land, and on other vital resources, mounts. Agricultural land 
  is the most affected, because it gets taken up by urbanization, with increasing 
  numbers of people migrating from rural to urban areas. As the pressure on agricu1tural 
  land increases, in order to provide food for an increasing population, the land 
  becomes overexploited, with all kinds of unsafe and unsustainable farming practices. 
  Soil salinity, water logging, soil erosion and land pollution are some of the 
  types of land degradation which emerge.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa</i></p>
<p>Soil erosion is probably the most important factor in the decline in agricultural 
  productivity in southern Africa, degrading about 15 per cent of this sub-region's 
  land. This trend is likely to continue over the next 30 years, due to population 
  pressure, skewed land tenure systems and increasing demand for land. A more 
  serious trend, resulting partly from soil erosion, and one that is reflected 
  throughout the world, is the decline in per capita food production. Southern 
  Africa has produced net food surpluses for many years, but in the Market Forces 
  scenario, the drop in per capita food production leads to net food deficits 
  well before 2032. This is despite the promise offered by new seed varieties 
  and by improved agricultural technology, which are unlikely to catch up with 
  population growth.</p>

  Western Africa</i></p>
<p>There is intense competition for land for investment in agriculture and manufacturing. 
  The good rainfall in most of the region makes large-scale farming and the building 
  of agro-industry a profitable investment. Local subsistence farmers are adequately 
  compensated, not only through direct purchases, but by employment options.</p>

<p>Urban sprawl increases as subsistence agriculture replaces estate management, 
  with a sharp decline in prices for sugar, tea, coffee and fruit. Disused factories 
  from textiles and other small industries are taken over by squatters. Uncontrolled 
  mineral exploitation in Madagascar degrades the surrounding land, and processing 
  pollutes water in rivers, aquifers and coasts. Illegal farming of cannabis and 
  poppy seed overtakes tobacco, as African and Asian influences in drug use permeate 
  the local culture, funded with laundered money from Latin America. Town and 
  country planning is undermined by weakness of government and extensive corruption 
  of officials, promoting urban sprawl and the collapse of protected areas, which 
  are converted into leisure centres and commercial game hunting parks. Remote 
  areas are sold off for dumping imported hazardous waste.</p>
