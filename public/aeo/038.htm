<h2>NORTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Northern Africa is one of the most arid areas of the world, with rainfalls 
  that vary widely in terms of both temporal and geographical distribution. Northern 
  African countries are also the most urbanized in Africa and are heavily dependent 
  on fossil fuels for energy. The major issues of concern in the sub-region are 
  therefore climate variability, climate change, and air quality in urban centres.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>

<p><a name="fig2a5"></a>Northern Africa experiences highly variable rainfall and 
  recurrent droughts. The sub-region receives only 7 per cent of Africa's total 
  precipitation and this is not evenly distributed. Egypt, for example, receives 
  just 18 mm/yr of rain (FAO 1995), Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia experienced 6-7 
  years of drought between 1980 and 1993, and Morocco has experienced a drought 
  in one year out of every three over the last century (Swearingen & Bencherifa 
  1996).</p>
<p>Flash floods-short-lived but very rapid rises in the level of water courses 
  or filling of dry beds-are a typical feature of several African countries. Often 
  following a brief downpour, flash floods rapidly erode soils, particularly where 
  natural vegetation cover has been cleared from slopes (Swearingen & Bencherifa 
  1996). In Egypt, flash floods are often accompanied by mudflows which can be 
  more disastrous than the floods themselves (Nemec 1991). Prior to the building 
  of the Aswan High Dam, Egypt was also subject to frequent floods during the 
  rainy season in the Ethiopian plateau (August through October) and to water 
  shortages in years with below normal rainfall.</p>
<p>Swearingen and Bencherifa (1996) have suggested that the hazard of drought 
  in Northern Africa has increased mainly as a result of expansion of cereal cultivation 
  to drought-prone rangeland and reduction of fallow systems. This process was 
  fostered during the colonial period by large-scale land expropriation and by 
  displacement of peasants to marginal lands. It was also influenced by incentive-raising 
  policies for cereal production, mechanization of agriculture, and by increased 
  demand for food associated with rapid population growth.</p>
<p>Drought has major socio-economic significance in Northern Africa because rain-fed 
  cereal cultivation is predominant. In 1997, for example, Algeria's cereal harvest 
  decreased sharply as a result of severe drought. In Morocco, agricultural output 
  recorded losses in 1992, 1995 and 1997. Drought also aggravates the effects 
  of overgrazing, increasing degradation of natural vegetation and soils. The 
  Nile River and Delta were much affected by the drought in the 1980s which resulted 
  in loss of output from agriculture and fisheries and a drop in water level in 
  Lake Nasser which exacerbated the country's existing irrigation problems (Abdel-Rahman, 
  Gad & Younes 1994). In the Sudano- Sahelian area, hundreds of thousands of people 
  were affected by famine, infectious diseases, and displacement (OFDA 1987).<br clear="all"></p>
