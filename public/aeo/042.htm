<h4>Towards improving air quality in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>In 1991, having identified the major sources and established levels of emissions 
  of the major air contaminants, the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for 
  the Environment (CAMRE) adopted the concept of sustainable development as the 
  basis for development in the 21st century. Control of air pollution, especially 
  in urban centres, was identified as one of the main objectives in Algeria, Libya 
  and Morocco. More liberal trade policies and the increased production of more 
  affordable vehicles will lead to the gradual replacement of highly polluting, 
  older vehicles. Another target that is expected to be of higher priority is 
  the reduction of the sulphur content of fuels. Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia 
  have included electrified railways in their transportation infrastructures and 
  Egypt has built an underground metro system that has made a considerable contribution 
  to reducing surface mass public transit thus reducing emissions from vehicles.</p>
<p>Industrial pollution abatement initiatives have been introduced in Northern 
  Africa and have begun to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. For example, conversion 
  of industrial enterprises to natural gas has been financed. In Tunisia, a solar 
  water-heating project will promote commercialization of solar water heating 
  technology in the residential sector. A repowering project in Morocco has also 
  been approved but is awaiting construction of a natural gas pipeline from the 
  Algeria-Portugal pipeline. Other projects at the preparation stage include solar, 
  wind, and waste-to-energy projects in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the Cairo Air Improvement Project (CAIP) aims to initiate and implement 
  measures to reduce air pollutants that have the most serious impacts on human 
  health in Greater Cairo, especially suspended particulates and lead (see <a href="#box2a1">Box 
  2a.1</a>). The CAIP will also monitor the effectiveness of pollution abatement 
  schemes implemented by the Egyptian Environment Affairs Agency, CAIP, and other 
  organizations.</p>

            <p>Recognising the seriousness of air pollution, the Egyptian government 
              has embarked on a comprehensive programme to improve air quality 
              throughout Egypt. In 1993, the country's Ministry of Petroleum introduced 
              unleaded fuel as a part of this programme and within two years 85 
              per cent of the country's fuel supply was converted. The Cairo Air 
              Improvement Project (CAIP), set up in 1997 and tasked with monitoring 
              ambient air quality, reported that levels of airborne lead in Cairo 
              had decreased by up to 88 per cent in just one year. Other initiatives 
              under the project include testing of compressed natural gas as an 
              alternative to diesel for public buses, and running a public awareness 
              campaign.</p>
