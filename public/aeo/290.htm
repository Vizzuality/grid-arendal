<h4><i>Land</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, modern law and traditional law, in terms of 
  land use management, are harmonized. This harmonization entails the reduction 
  of conflicts linked to land use. The procedures of acquiring land occupancy 
  papers are simplified, and the costs reduced. The ongoing population pressure 
  remains controllable, and is managed according to the areas with a greater population 
  density.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>Land reform programmes are supplemented by comprehensive land use policies. 
  All major land use programmes undergo EIAs to identify mainstream environmental 
  considerations. Universal primary education policies increase literacy, and 
  have a ripple effect in contraceptive prevalence and family planning. There 
  is a subsequent reduction in the population growth rate, thus relieving pressure 
  on land. Urban migration is reduced, because there are deliberate policies to 
  increase land-based employment opportunities in rural areas.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>The relative slowing down in the population growth rates eases demand on land. 
  The pressure on resources is further relieved as governments give more emphasis 
  on the planning and implementation of land use plans. The reduction in the numbers 
  of migrants from rural to urban areas helps to reduce the rapid unplanned expansion 
  of urban areas. Due care is given to the problem of the loss of good agricultural 
  land due to soil salinization in agriculture, and organic fertilizers are employed.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa</i></p>
<p>Land reforms in Southern Africa are guided by principles of good governance 
  and a taxation system in order to maximize productivity and profitability, leading 
  to equitable land distribution. Cash farming becomes a predominant activity, 
  with the sub-region engaging itself in farming activities in which it has comparative 
  advantages. Food security is achieved through trade.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, there are successful land reform policies, which 
  depart from both colonial land holding laws and traditional holdings laws. The 
  new policies result from an evolutionary strategy under which landed city dwellers 
  and traditional chiefs in rural areas allow the government to mediate arrangements 
  for both industries and communities to become beneficiaries. Ferocious competition 
  becomes a thing of the past, and conflicts are, therefore, minimized.. There 
  is an acceptance that the reforms are benefitting the greater society. The resulting 
  development, though slow, is planned and peaceful.</p>

  West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, urbanization continues, whilst forest and woodland 
  areas remain protected and extended. Agriculture in Madagascar gives way to 
  new exploitation of mineral resources in controlled and wellmanaged developments, 
  respecting environmental standards. Ecotourism promotes protection for the remoter 
  parts of the region, serving as a model for the re-examination of western practices 
  in countryside planning. Sugar kibbutz estates are developed by small planters, 
  using manual methods and traditional animals for power. Traditional sailing 
  boat flotilla holidays become well established. These two developments reinforce 
  traditional land use under model conditions, and revive slackening parts of 
  the economy and culture. Populations of giant tortoises are reestablished as 
  new tourist attractions in Rodrigues and Bird Island.</p>
