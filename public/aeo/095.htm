<h3>COASTAL EROSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE </h3>
<p>Erosion and deposition are natural and dynamic processes occurring in coastal 
  zones throughout the world. However, certain human activities, both inland and 
  in the coastal zone itself can change patterns of erosion and deposition and 
  thus place a burden on the adaptive capacity of coastal ecosystems and pose 
  a challenge to effective coastal management. Human activities including conversion 
  of natural coastal habitats such as wetlands and mangroves to urban or agricultural 
  uses lead to their loss or modification. For example, it is estimated that about 
  40 per cent of Nigeria's mangroves had been lost by 1980 as a result of clearing 
  for development, coastal erosion, and increased salinity (WRI 1990). When such 
  ecosystems are reduced, the natural buffer they provide against wave action 
  and storm surges is compromised, resulting in increased erosion and worsened 
  impacts of flooding.</p>
<p>Mining of coastal resources such as coral and sand also contributes to erosion 
  by disturbing the surface and exposing the substrate to rain, rivers and wave 
  action. Mining of coral to provide stone for construction means that the protection 
  the coral normally gives to the shoreline is lost, and land recession results.</p>

<p>Damming of rivers further inland forces sediments to settle upstream allowing 
  fewer sediments to reach the river mouth. This increases the river's scouring 
  potential leading to higher rates of erosion in the coastal zone. For example, 
  damming of rivers in Western Africa has accelerated rates of coastal erosion 
  and these have now reached as much as 30 m/yr (Chidi Ibe & Quelennac 1989). 
  Damming of the Nile River at Aswan reduced the nutrient load reaching the Nile 
  Delta and this reduced sardine fishery catches from 22 618 million tonnes in 
  1968 to only 13 450 million tonnes in 1980, with rates still falling. Although 
  the reservoir behind the dam created new fishing opportunities, there are doubts 
  as to the sustainability of harvesting of these resources and many coastal communities 
  have lost their livelihood. (Acreman 1999). Sedimentation in ports and harbours 
  can also interfere with activities, and dredging is costly.</p>
<p>Sea level rises resulting from global climate change will exert additional 
  pressures on the coastal zone, causing inundation of low-lying areas, erosion 
  of infrastructure, displacement of populations, and contamination of freshwater 
  sources. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
  the average global sea level has risen by 1-2 mm per year during the last century. 
  The most likely cause of this is expansion of seawater and widespread loss of 
  land ice caused by higher mean global temperatures. The IPCC also predicts that, 
  by 2100, the global sea level could rise by up to one metre (IPCC 2001a). The 
  consequent flooding, and changes in salinity, wave conditions and ocean circulation 
  will put natural habitats and human settlements at risk of flooding and accelerated 
  erosion. The extent and severity of the impacts of storms will also increase 
  as a result of further climatic changes, and because the buffering capacity 
  of coral reefs and mangrove systems will have been lost. Human settlements and 
  economic activities in the Gulf of Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Egypt, and along 
  the eastern African coast, including the Western Indian Ocean, are likely to 
  be most severely affected (IPCC 2001b). Some of these countries may be unable 
  to cope with the financial and technical burden of implementation of mitigation 
  measures (Leatherman & Nicholls 1995).</p>
<p>In addition to sea level rise, sea-surface temperatures in the open tropical 
  oceans surrounding Africa are predicted to rise by about 0.6-0.8 °C (less than 
  the global average). This may increase the frequency and intensity of tropical 
  cyclones and result in bleaching of coral that will impact on the economies 
  of countries on the eastern African coast, of the Western Indian Ocean Islands, 
  and of the countries of the Red Sea.</p>
<h4>Mitigation of coastal erosion</h4>
<p>African countries have promulgated laws and regulations requiring environmental 
  impact studies to be carried out before development in coastal zones or hinterlands, 
  thus regulating change of land use and expansion of human activities. Countries 
  that have taken such action include Egypt, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, 
  Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Short-term 
  measures against coastal erosion include the construction of physical barriers 
  such as sea walls and groynes, although these are expensive and require constant 
  maintenance.</p>
<p>In addition, many African countries are adopting more integrated environmental 
  management strategies, based on ecological management units rather than political 
  boundaries. A holistic management approach improves the integration of different 
  resource-use objectives and reduces competition between user groups. Coastal 
  erosion is therefore being tackled in some countries through improved water 
  catchment management, more conservative agricultural practices, and soil conservation 
  programmes.</p>
<p>Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), discussed more fully below, is a 
  holistic approach that has been adopted widely within Africa's coastal zone 
  to help to reduce the causes and impacts of coastal erosion. Sub-regional and 
  regional cooperative programmes and action plans (such as UNEP's Regional Seas 
  Programme) provide the framework and necessary capacity building for implementation 
  of ICZM at the national level. If the state of coastal and marine ecosystems 
  and the sustainability of commercial and subsistence activities dependent on 
  them are to be improved, continued support for such programmes is necessary, 
  in the form of trained staff, finance, equipment for policy implementation, 
  research, monitoring, and enforcement of regulations.</p>
