<p>As has already been highlighted, loss and degradation of habitats have been 
  widespread in Africa. Some 0.78 per cent of forest area was lost in 1990-2000, 
  representing a total loss of some 5.2 million ha. Increasing demand for fuelwood, 
  which accounted for more than 90 per cent of roundwood produced in 1990, has 
  accelerated the destruction of forests, which now cover about one-third of the 
  African region. Every year, an area of about 4 million ha (roughly the size 
  of Switzerland) is deforested. The situation has been particularly alarming 
  in the Lake Chad basin, as a result of the demand for fuelwood. In addition 
  to losing populations of various species, the cost of deforestation to people 
  in Africa may be massive, particularly considering the fact that many populations 
  depend on wildlife for food and other goods. Deforestation is a threat to people's 
  livelihood options, contributing to habitat loss, soil and wind erosion, and 
  general land degradation. For a region which virtually depends on fuelwood for 
  its energy needs, deforestation also has social and economic costs. In many 
  sub-regions, fuelwood makes up 61-86 per cent of primary energy consumption; 
  some 74-97 per cent of this is for household consumption. Charcoal production, 
  which is widespread in the region and which provides many jobs, is a US$1 000 
  million activity (Amous undated). Unsustainable forest harvests threaten this 
  industry, exacerbating the problem of unemployment.</p>
<p>Habitat and biodiversity loss can also affect tourism in the region, contributing 
  to poor economic performance. This has serious impacts on revenue and jobs, 
  particularly in countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, which are heavily 
  dependent on wildlife tourism.</p>
<p>Wild food plays an important role in food security for rural people and is 
  also, increasingly, a commercial commodity which is traded nationally and regionally. 
  In many urban areas, meat from wild animals commands a significantly higher 
  price than meat from domestic animals. Very large quantities of meat are involved. 
  It has been estimated that, in the moist forests of Central Africa alone, as 
  much as 1 million t of wildlife (primarily forest antelope, wild pigs and primates) 
  may be killed for food each year.</p>
<p>Rural and urban populations across Africa depend largely on medicinal plants, 
  often collected from the wild, for their health needs, due to preference or 
  a lack of affordable alternatives. Some species, such as the montane tree <i>Prunus 
  africana </i>and the southern African devil's claw <i>Harpagophytum</i> spp., 
  are also exported in significant quantities. Overharvesting, agricultural encroachment 
  and unregulated burning are believed to be contributing to the decline of many 
  species in the wild. Unsustainable activities may foreclose such livelihood 
  options, making more and more people vulnerable.</p>
