<h3>EXTENT AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CULTIVATION AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN 
  CENTRAL AFRICA </h3>
<p>Land development for crop cultivation increased rapidly between 1970 and 1985 
  (from 18 million ha to 21 million ha), but then the rate of expansion slowed, 
  until 1999, when the total cultivated area was 21.5 million ha (FAOSTAT 2001). 
  The period of rapid increase must have come as a result of the boom in export 
  crop prices, especially from coffee and cocoa sales, followed by the economic 
  crises of the 1990s, during which land use for export cash crops decreased. 
  Over the same period, the extent of permanent pasture has shown little change, 
  and it stands at approximately 80 million ha (FAOSTAT 2001).</p>
<p>Absolute production for crops has increased steadily over the past 30 years, 
  but crop production per capita has declined, due to population growth rates 
  exceeding food production capacity (see <a href="#fig2f14">Figure 2f.14</a>) 
  (FAOSTAT 2001). Interestingly, absolute livestock production indices for the 
  sub-region have increased quite significantly, but livestock production per 
  capita has remained relatively constant (see <a href="#fig2f15">Figure 2f.15</a>) 
  (FAOSTAT 2001).</p>

<p>As a result of declining yields and civil wars, calorie intake in Cameroon, 
  Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo in 1999 was lower 
  than in 1970. For the other countries, it had improved, but was still, on average, 
  just 2 292 cal/capita/day (FAOSTAT 2001). To compensate for this, many countries 
  have imported large amounts of cereals and, during times of drought, Cameroon, 
  Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad have requested food aid. The Democratic 
  Republic of Congo is normally an importer of cereals but, in 1998, livestock 
  production suffered from the civil strife (more so than crop production), and 
  food production shortfalls were estimated at 118 000 tonnes. Due to the disruption 
  of trading activities, particularly in Brazzaville, commercial food imports 
  were reduced, and 46 000 tonnes of cereal were required to meet the population's 
  needs. A variety of coping mechanisms were enacted, including increasing effort 
  in alternative food production areas (fishing and hunting, and short-cycle crops), 
  as well as food aid for vulnerable groups (FAO/GIEWS 1998).</p>
