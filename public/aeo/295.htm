<h4><i>Urban areas</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, clean water and sanitation has become virtually 
  equally available in rural and urban areas, as a result of improvements in infrastructure. 
  Most rural residents have access to piped water. Tax and other incentives encourage 
  entrepreneurs to invest in both urban and rural areas, thus reducing rural-urban 
  migration, and lowering pressures on services and the environment in urban areas. 
  The investment in rural areas also helps to diversify the agrarian economy, 
  which is dominant in many parts of the region. The diversification of the rural 
  economy helps to eliminate the conversion of fragile ecosystems into agricultural 
  land, a problem which had begun to manifest itself increasingly in the last 
  decade of the 20th century.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>The Policy Reform scenario fosters better management of the cities, with the 
  involvement of various parties in defining blueprints for urban planning and 
  land occupancy plans. The parties include, among others, territorial and local 
  authorities, and civil society organizations. The issue of satellite urbanization 
  is better controlled, with private companies, regional and local authorities, 
  and civil society organizations in charge of urban regional development all 
  playing a role. Social welfare departments are mostly privatized, thus increasing 
  the cost of access to quality services. The poverty gap widens between the richest 
  and the poorest, but a good standard of living remains within the reach of middle-class 
  citizens. The problem of sanitation (waste management) remains an issue.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>More planned and less congested urban centres emerge as land use planning policies 
  are implemented. The majority of urban dwellers have access to clean water and 
  sanitation. Solid waste management problems are tackled with the involvement 
  of the private sector. Crime rates are reduced as better investment policies 
  result in a vibrant private sector, which is able to create youth employment.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, efforts to reduce population densities in large 
  cities, and well-planned urban development, improve the urban environment. Safe 
  drinking water, sanitation, transportation and power supply are all available 
  to old, as well as to new, cities. As public transport improves, more people 
  use it in place of using private vehicles, thus reducing the air quality problem. 
  A proper system for solid waste management is adopted, and better education 
  sees people care more about their sensitive urban environment. Industries located 
  within urban areas are forced to control their gas emissions and waste, in order 
  to minimize their impact on the environment.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Provision of social services is totally privatized, resulting in proper waste 
  disposal in urban areas and the reuse of all recyclable waste. However, the 
  pace of urbanization remains high, and the problem of waste disposal in informal 
  settlements remains an issue.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, the success of rural development programmes 
  stem rural-urban migration. Self-managing communities are in charge of all social 
  services. Very small management units cooperate where necessary to provide services. 
  Urban planning has become far more advanced, with equal access to services being 
  central.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Urban areas continue to expand in all parts of the region, with insufficient 
  attention to urban planning. Mismanagement, and political corruption in granting 
  unwarranted permissions, also greatly affect development and lead to abuse of 
  the urban environment.</p>
