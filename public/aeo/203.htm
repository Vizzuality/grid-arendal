<h2>REGIONAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Thirty-eight per cent of Africa's population, that is to say 297 million people, 
  live in urban areas. By 2030, this is expected to grow to approximately 54 per 
  cent of Africa's projected population of around 1405 million (UNCHS 2001a). 
  The level of urbanization in Africa is on a par with that in Asia, but lower 
  than the global figure of 47 per cent, and well below the European and North 
  American levels of over 70 per cent (UNCHS 2001a). However, it must be borne 
  in mind that the definition of what constitutes an urban area differs from one 
  African country to another. For example, in Uganda a settlement with a population 
  of more than 100 is classified as urban, whereas in Nigeria and Mauritius an 
  urban area has a population of more than 20 000 (UNCHS 2001b). There are also 
  difficulties in defining a city, as cities are not only defined on the basis 
  of population size but also of administrative or legislative functions. Large 
  cities, however, are generally those with populations over a million, and mega-cities 
  have populations of more than 10 million (UNCHS 2001b).</p>

<a name="fig2g1"></a>Africa's rate of urbanization of 3.5 per cent per year is 
the highest in the world, resulting in more urban areas with bigger populations, 
as well as the expansion of existing urban areas (UNCHS 2001a). There are currently 
40 cities in Africa with populations of more than a million and it is expected 
that by 2015 seventy cities will have populations of one million or more. Lagos, 
with its current population of 13.4 million is the largest city in Africa, and 
the 6th largest in the world. Cairo, Africa's second largest city, has a population 
of 10.6 million and ranks 19th in the world (UNCHS 2001b). The growth of Africa's 
urban population is shown in <a href="#fig2g1">Figure 2g.1</a>. 
<p>Northern Africa is Africa's most urbanized subregion with, on average, 64 per 
  cent of its population living in urban centres. Libya is the most urbanized 
  country with 87.6 per cent of the population living in urban areas (UNCHS 2001a). 
  Central Africa and the Western Indian Ocean Islands are also considerably urbanized, 
  with average urban populations of 48 per cent each, followed by Western Africa 
  (38 per cent) and Southern Africa (36 per cent). The least urbanized subregion 
  is Eastern Africa (26 per cent), and Rwanda is the least urbanized country, 
  with an urban population of just 6.2 per cent (UNCHS 2001a). However, Eastern 
  Africa has the highest average rate of urbanization for any of Africa's sub-regions, 
  averaging 4.5 per cent per year. Malawi has the highest rate of all African 
  countries (6.3 per cent per year).</p>

<p>The reasons for rapid growth of urban populations include overall high population 
  growth rates, and 'pull factors' such as opportunities for employment, education, 
  and improved access to health care which attract people from urban areas. African 
  cities account for 60 per cent of the region's GDP and are important centres 
  for education, employment, and trade (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
<p>The colonial influence on development resulted in many of Africa's urban centres 
  and national capitals being located on the coast, maximizing access to trade, 
  international travel, and development. However, there are also many social challenges 
  associated with urbanization, such as the influx into urban areas of people 
  forced out of rural areas by declining agricultural yields and who come to the 
  urban areas in the hope of employment and greater income security. In many urban 
  areas rates of economic growth and infrastructure development have lagged urbanization 
  rates, resulting in high levels of unemployment, inadequate standards of housing 
  and services, and impacts on human health and development. Environmental disasters 
  and conflicts have also caused many people to flee rural areas and to seek refuge 
  in urban centres. In Mozambique about 4.5 million rural people were displaced 
  to urban areas because of civil strife in the 1980s (Chenje 2000) and the third 
  largest settlement in Sierra Leone is a displaced persons camp (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
