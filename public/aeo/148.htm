<h2><a name="fig2e1"></a>REGIONAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER</h3>
<p>Freshwater availability is one of the most critical factors in development, 
  particularly in Africa. Some 71 per cent of the earth's surface is water. However, 
  less than 3 per cent is freshwater, and most of that is either in the form of 
  ice and snow in the polar regions, or in underground aquifers.</p>
<p>Africa's share of global freshwater resources is about 9 per cent, or 4 050 
  km<sup>3</sup>/yr (Shiklomanov 1999, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). These 
  freshwater resources are distributed unevenly across Africa, with western Africa 
  and central Africa having significantly greater precipitation than northern 
  Africa, the Horn of Africa and southern Africa. The wettest country, the Democratic 
  Republic of Congo (DRC), has nearly 25 per cent of average annual internal renewable 
  water resources in Africa, with 935 km<sup>3</sup>/yr. By contrast, the driest 
  country, Mauritania, has just 0.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, or 0.01 per cent of Africa's 
  total (UNDP and others 2000). Average water availability per person in Africa 
  is 5 720 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/year compared to a global average of 7 600 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/year, 
  but there are large disparities between sub-regions, as shown in <a href="#fig2e1">Figure 
  2e.1</a></p>
<p>Problems with freshwater availability in Africa are further complicated by 
  highly variable levels of rainfall. As a result, large numbers of people are 
  dependent on groundwater as their primary source of freshwater. In Algeria, 
  for example, more than 60 per cent of all withdrawals are from groundwater and, 
  in Libya, 95 per cent of all withdrawals are from groundwater (UNDP and others 
  2000). Some countries, including Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritius0, Morocco, 
  South Africa and Tunisia, make use of desalinated water to assist in meeting 
  their withdrawal requirements (UNDP and others 2000, GOM/ERM 1998).</p>

<p><a name="fig2e2"></a>Most African countries also experience extremes of rainfall 
  (periodic flooding or drought). There is some evidence that both droughts and 
  floods have increased in frequency and severity over the past 30 years (OFDA 
  2000). In particular, the Sahelian zone has experienced a continued decline 
  in rainfall compared to pre-1960s averages, and Lake Chad has shrunk to 5 per 
  cent of its size 35 years ago (NASA Global Earth Observing System 2001). Severe 
  droughts were experienced in 1973 and 1984, when almost all African countries 
  suffered reduced rainfall, and several million people in the Horn of Africa 
  and the Sahelian zone, and in southern Africa, were affected.</p>
<p>The freshwater lakes of Africa have a total volume of 30 567 km<sup>3</sup>, 
  covering a surface area of 165 581 km<sup>2</sup>. Not only are they important 
  in water flow regulation, flooding control and water storage, but they are also 
  important for meeting human needs. Lake Tanganyika alone could supply water 
  to 400 million people through the annual extraction of less than 1 per cent 
  of its volume (Khroda 1996). With the exception of Lake Tana in Ethiopia, all 
  African lakes are shared across international borders, which makes international 
  cooperation a necessary condition for equitable use and development of lake 
  resources. Wetlands cover about 1 per cent of Africa's total surface area, and 
  are found in almost every country (WCMC 1992). The largest wetlands include: 
  the Zaire swamps; the Sudd in the upper Nile River; the Lake Victoria basin; 
  the Chad basin; the Okavango delta; the Bangweulu swamps; and the floodplains 
  and deltas of the Niger and Zambezi rivers.</p>
<p>Africa has the highest rate of population growth in the world, and is also 
  one of the regions that is most vulnerable to climate change. The Intergovernmental 
  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that average runoff and water availability 
  will decline in the countries of northern and southern Africa, impacting on 
  freshwater ecosystems, and advancing desertification in the Sahelian zone and 
  in northern Africa (IPCC 2001). In addition, increased frequency of flooding 
  and drought will also stress freshwater systems and pressurize water supply 
  networks. As a result, 25 African countries are expected to experience water 
  scarcity or water stress over the next 20-30 years, as shown in <a href="#fig2e2">Figure 
  2e.2</a> (UNEP 1999a).</p>
<p>All the above factors combine to create enormous challenges for water storage, 
  supply and distribution, as well as for water treatment (purification and wastewater 
  treatment). Despite considerable efforts to develop water storage and infrastructure, 
  particularly in the past 30 years, large numbers of people remain without access 
  to water for domestic use, and many farmers do not have access to water for 
  irrigation. By contrast, some industrial, agricultural and domestic users have 
  access to subsidized water supplies, and have no incentive to use water carefully, 
  or to reuse or recycle water. Access to water resources is thus a priority issue 
  for the countries of Africa, together with rising concerns over water quality, 
  due to excessive water withdrawal and declining availability, and pollution 
  from a variety of sources.</p>

            <p>Water is a precious resource. In Africa, it can be a matter of 
              life and death. It can also be a matter of economic survival.Yet 
              it can be both an instrument and a limiting factor in poverty alleviation 
              and economic recovery, lifting people out of the degradation of 
              having to live without access to safe water and sanitation, while 
              at the same time bringing prosperity to all on the continent. A 
              radical change in approach is required if water is not to become 
              a constraint, but an instrument, to socioeconomic development in 
              Africa.</p>
