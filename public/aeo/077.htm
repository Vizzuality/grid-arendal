<h2><a name="img2b10"></a>WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h2>
<p>The importance of conservation within oceanic islands is perhaps best expressed 
  by the fact that they are home to around one-sixth of all plant species, and 
  that one in three of all known threatened plant species are island endemics. 
  The Western Indian Ocean Islands, uninhabited until the 16th and 17th centuries, 
  are a typical example where rich land based flora and fauna have evolved in 
  isolation from human intervention and from the intrusion of other alien species 
  that the human presence so often brings Madagascar has the highest number of 
  endemic species of any country in the Africa region, and ranks sixth in the 
  world. Up to 8 000 of the 9 500 species of higher plants and over 50 per cent 
  of all vertebrate species found in the island are known or are thought to be 
  endemic (UNEP 1999). In Mauritius, around 50 per cent of all higher plants, 
  mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are endemic to the island, and the Seychelles 
  has the highest level of amphibian endemism of any island in the world (11 of 
  the 12 species are found nowhere else) (WCMC 1992).</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUES OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN THE WESTERN 
  INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h3>
<p>This extraordinary biodiversity of the Western Indian Ocean Islands not only 
  contributes to their unique ecological conditions, it also provides valuable 
  raw materials for local and commercial use. In addition to use for food, construction, 
  clothing and shelter, many plant species are used medicinally and several species 
  are being researched for commercial agricultural or pharmaceutical use. For 
  example, the native Coffea sp. is being investigated for commercial production 
  of naturally caffeine-free coffee (GOM/ERM 1998).</p>
<p>The Islands' internationally renowned coral reefs support a booming tourism 
  industry and subsistence and commercial fisheries. There are also ten species 
  of mangroves providing stabilization of the coastal zone, creating spawning 
  and nursery grounds for many fish species, mitigating storm impacts, and providing 
  resources for construction, weaving, and food.</p>
