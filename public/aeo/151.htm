<h3>WATER QUALITY</h3>
<p>Not only is the availability of freshwater a major constraint to development 
  but, in all sub-regions of Africa, the quality of freshwater is also raising 
  concerns. Some of the manifestations of poor water quality are: eutrophication 
  in lakes and dams; contamination of groundwater with nitrates and salts; and 
  loss of aquatic habitats and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Eutrophication is the proliferation of algae due to raised levels of nutrients 
  in the water body. Poor agricultural practices, and the unregulated discharge 
  of untreated or partially treated sewage, are contributing factors. Algal blooms 
  change the composition and functioning of the natural biota. They can be hazardous 
  to human health, they make the environment less attractive for recreation and 
  sport, and they increase the cost of water treatment. Raised levels of nutrients 
  in water bodies can also encourage the spread of water weeds, and many lakes 
  and wetlands-including the Caprivi wetland system (Namibia), Lake Victoria (East 
  Africa) and Lake Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe)-are experiencing problems of infestation 
  by the water hyacinth, Eichornia crassipes. This weed forms dense mats that 
  block water channels, disrupting flow patterns and presenting a hazard for boat 
  traffic. Decaying mats of the weed generate bad odours and lead to eutrophication 
  of the water body. Affected countries have initiated biological and chemical 
  control programmes, in addition to mechanical clearance, with some success to 
  date (Global Water Partnership 2000).</p>

      <p> Groundwater pollution is a particular concern in the more arid countries, 
        which are highly dependent on underground aquifers for drinking water 
        supplies. The main pollutants are nitrates and phosphates, together with 
        chemical residues from seepage of agricultural runoff, and from inappropriate 
        discharge of industrial and domestic wastewater.</p>

<p>Groundwater pollution is a particular concern in the more arid countries, which 
  are highly dependent on underground aquifers for drinking water supplies. The 
  main pollutants are nitrates and phosphates, together with chemical residues 
  from seepage of agricultural runoff, and from inappropriate discharge of industrial 
  and domestic wastewater. In low-lying areas, salinization of groundwater aquifers 
  is a further concern, through the intrusion of saltwater and seepage of irrigation 
  water. Expected sea level rise under climate change scenarios will cause further 
  widespread contamination of aquifers. Therefore, it is critical that action 
  is taken now, in order to ensure the sustained protection and sustainable use 
  of underground water resources.</p>
<p>Freshwater lakes, wetlands and dams are also experiencing loss of biodiversity, 
  as a result of industrial pollution and contamination of water sources by acidmine 
  drainage. Lake Chivero in Zimbabwe, for example, experienced massive fish deaths 
  in 1970, 1991 and 1996, due to high levels of ammonia and heavy metals, and 
  low oxygen levels (Gumbo 1997). The Korle Lagoon in Ghana has been severely 
  degraded, due to nearby development and associated effluents, dumping of solid 
  waste, and run-off from surrounding areas, such that almost all wildlife has 
  disappeared (Accra Sustainable Programme 2001). These threats to wetlands, and 
  the requirements of the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International 
  Importance have encouraged many countries to develop Wetlands Conservation Strategies, 
  including Ghana, South Africa and Uganda.</p>
<p>Contamination of freshwater habitats, such as lagoons, wetlands, lakes and 
  rivers, not only threatens ecological health, but the health of humans as well. 
  Declining water quality results in an increased risk of water-related disease 
  outbreaks. Diseases such as diarrhoea, ascariasis, dracunculosis, hookworm, 
  schistosomiasis and trachoma are on the increase, particularly in urban informal 
  settlements, where levels of water supply and sanitation provision are low. 
  Lack of water of sufficient quality also reduces agricultural sustainability 
  and potential output which, in turn, force increased importation of foodstuffs 
  and agricultural products. Similarly, poor water quality limits economic development 
  options, such as water-intensive industries and tourism.</p>
