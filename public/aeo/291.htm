<h4><i>Biodiversity</i></h4>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Africa</i></p>
<p>A technology levy on all tourism receipts generates revenue to undertake comprehensive 
  research on Africa's biodiversity, leading to the identification of numerous 
  species-both fauna and flora-which had not been recorded before. This research 
  adds tremendously to the global understanding of the region's biodiversity, 
  and also generates further tourism interest in Africa.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Central 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The harmonization of legislation relating to conservation helps to exploit 
  natural resources better. Ongoing processes of decentralization continue, and 
  lead to the involvement of various stakeholders in the management of biodiversity. 
  Practical and realistic laws define the frameworks for the conservation of natural 
  resources, by defining the right to natural resources use by the sub-region's 
  populations. The populations see their recognition and participate in the conservation 
  of natural resources. The laws define the conditions for laboratory research 
  and development in charge of enhancing non-wood forestry products.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Eastern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Biodiversity is the most important asset of this subregion, because it forms 
  the basis of the growing tourism industry. In the Policy Reform scenario, tourism 
  continues to make a significant contribution to the subregion's GDP and foreign 
  exchange earnings. Policies to protect sites with unique biodiversity are established 
  and enforced. Deliberate efforts are directed towards curbing illegal activities, 
  such as poaching and insecurity, in the protected areas. International and regional 
  conventions and agreements on biodiversity resources are actively implemented, 
  and external donor assistance is sought to enhance institutional capacity building 
  for those institutions charged with the responsibility of conserving biodiversity 
  resources.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Despite the relative increase in population numbers, planned urbanization and 
  industrialization ensure that measures are taken to protect the natural environment. 
  Industrial activities near protected areas are totally banned. Industries that 
  seriously affect biodiversity through harmful waste products are forced to comply 
  with environmental laws or pay heavy fines. The limited areas of wetlands, where 
  a wide variety of fauna and flora live, are all declared protected areas. International 
  technical and financial assistance is sought in order to restore the unique 
  ecosystems of those areas.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, a large number of areas throughout this sub-region 
  have been declared protected areas, in the interest of biodiversity. As a result, 
  a great deal and variety of fauna and flora are alive. Harmful activities, including 
  the dumping of hazardous substances, are banned, and public education is paying 
  off. Self-regulatory bodies and communities are functioning properly in order 
  to protect the environment.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>West 
  Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>The region builds strongly on the lead already established in species protection. 
  However, it fails to maintain its momentum because of the inability to attract 
  sufficient local scientists, brain drain and the failure in the reform of civil 
  service to offer market rates for this scarce international resource. This means 
  that much of the world leadership is lost. Many species fail to be saved from 
  extinction, including various species of molluscs in Madagascar, turtles from 
  the Comoros and the pink pigeon from Mauritius, after Round Island becomes the 
  regional headquarters for ecotourism, upsetting the birds' habitat.</p>
