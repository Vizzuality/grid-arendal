<h3>LAND RIGHTS IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h3>
<p>Land tenure arrangements vary within and between countries, which often creates 
  conflicts over land ownership, access to resources, land use and distribution 
  of benefits. These, in turn, influence investment patterns and land management 
  practices, and can lead to land degradation. The richer parts of the region 
  have established more equitable distribution of land between their differing 
  communities, with effective protection of land rights. In the poorer islands, 
  however, much needs to be done, and the lack of equitable land policies and 
  practices present direct threats to sustainable land quality. In Mauritius, 
  90 per cent of land is privately owned, and more than 80 per cent of families 
  own their own homes with governmentregistered deeds. By contrast, in Madagascar, 
  land is generally owned through inheritance without title deeds, resulting in 
  conflicts over land rights, and in short-term exploitation of soil (FAO 1997b). 
  In Comoros, three types of land tenure laws apply: colonial law, customary law 
  and Islamic law. As in Madagascar, lack of registration in Comoros creates confusion 
  over ownership and access rights (RFIC 1998). In Seychelles, 70 per cent of 
  the land is stateowned and is then leased to smallholders (Republic of Seychelles 
  1997, UNDP 1997). Since 1993, however, land reform processes are underway in 
  Seychelles, in order to transfer land back to original owners (UNEP 1999b). 
  In Madagascar, a land reform study was started in 1993 to improve understanding 
  of the relationship between land tenure and degradation, and the likely future 
  consequences of rising population and demand for land and resources. Additional 
  studies are required to determine the role of traditional property rights in 
  sustainable land use and to make recommendations for short-term local action 
  programmes, coupled with reforms in land tenure and land use, as well as development 
  policies (World Bank 1993b).</p>
