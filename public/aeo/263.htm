<h2>METHODOLOGY: THE SCENARIO APPROACH</h2>
<p>[This section and the next section contain text drawn from Paul Raskin (30 
  June 2000; 1 September 2000 (revised); 16 October 16 2000 (second revision)) 
  and <i>GEO-3 Scenarios: Preliminary Framework</i>' (SEI-Boston).]</p>
<p>AMCEN's mandate to assess long-range environmental issues poses significant 
  methodological challenges. Because the time horizon expands from years to decades, 
  the long-range future cannot be extrapolated or predicted due to three types 
  of indeterminacy: ignorance, surprise and volition. First, insufficient information 
  on both the current state of the system and on the forces governing its dynamics 
  leads to a classical statistical dispersion over possible future scenarios. 
  Second, even if precise information were available, complex systems are known 
  to exhibit turbulent behaviour, extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and 
  branching behaviours at various thresholds. Therefore, the possibilities for 
  novelty, surprise and emergent phenomena make prediction impossible. Finally, 
  the future is unknowable because it is subject to human choices that have not 
  yet been made. In the face of such indeterminacy, scenarios offer a means for 
  examining the forces shaping the world, the uncertainties that lie ahead and 
  the implications for tomorrow of today's actions.</p>
<p>A scenario is a story, told in words and numbers, concerning the manner in 
  which future events could unfold, and offering lessons on how to direct the 
  flow of events towards sustainable pathways and away from unsustainable ones. 
  Development scenarios are alternative stories about the future with a logical 
  plot and narrative. Scenarios usually include images of the future-snapshots 
  of the major features of interest at various points in time-and an account of 
  the flow of events leading to such future conditions.</p>
<p>Scenarios draw both on science-on our understanding of historical patterns, 
  current conditions, and physical and social processes-and on the imagination 
  in order to conceive, articulate and evaluate alternative pathways of development 
  and the environment. In so doing, scenarios can illuminate the links between 
  issues, the relationship between global and regional development, and the role 
  of human actions in shaping the future. It is this added insight-leading to 
  more informed and rational action-that is the foremost goal of scenarios, rather 
  than prediction of the future.</p>

<p><a name="fig42"></a>Although scenarios certainly can offer quantitative insight, 
  they are not primarily modelling exercises. The qualitative scenario narrative 
  plays a critical role in giving voice to key aspects such as cultural influences, 
  values, behaviours and institutions, which are not quantifiable. Thus, scenarios 
  can provide a broader perspective than model-based analyses, while at the same 
  time making use of various quantitative tools, such as accounting frameworks 
  and mathematical simulation models. Quantitative analysis offers a degree of 
  structure, discipline and rigour. Scenarios can offer texture, richness and 
  insight.</p>
<p><a href="#fig42">Figure 4.2</a> illustrates the major features that govern 
  the dynamics of change associated with scenarios of combined human and environmental 
  systems. The 'current state' of the system is the outcome of an historical process, 
  which is driven forward by a set of 'driving forces'. Moreover, the capacity 
  of human beings to imagine alternative futures and to act intentionally means 
  that images of the future can act as 'attractive forces' and 'repulsive forces' 
  in shaping a scenario. In addition, there is the possibility that surprising 
  and extreme occurrences-called 'sideswipes'-could affect development. Many unexpected 
  events could be involved (for example, a breakdown of the climate system, a 
  world war, cheap fusion power, a major natural disaster or a rampant global 
  epidemic such as HIV/AIDS), but probabilities cannot be assigned, nor can all 
  the possibilities be imagined.</p>
<p>Some key issues to consider in the formulation of scenarios include: the boundary; 
  the current state; the definition and determination of driving forces; the narrative, 
  or storyline; and images of the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The boundary of the scenario is specified in several senses: spatially (for 
    example, global, regional, subregional, national or local); thematically (for 
    example, coverage of sectors and issues); and temporally (the time horizon 
    of the analysis).</li>
  <li>The current state covers a range of dimensions: economic, demographic, environmental, 
    institutional and so on. In the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO), as well 
    as in the AEO, the dimensions are land, atmosphere, forests, freshwater, coastal 
    and marine resources, biodiversity and urban environment.</li>
  <li>The important driving forces are those which condition and change the system. 
    These are described in the GEO and AEO as demographics, economics, social 
    issues, culture, technology, environment and governance.</li>
  <li>The narrative, or storyline, provides the plot by which the scenario stories 
    unfold (often, quantitative indicators are used to illuminate aspects of the 
    scenarios).</li>
  <li>An image of the future paints a picture of conditions at one or more points 
    in time. </li>
</ul>
