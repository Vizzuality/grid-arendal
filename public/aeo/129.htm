<p>Deforestation is defined by the FAO as 'the conversion of forest to another 
  land use or the long-term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the minimum 
  10 percent threshold.' Forest degradation is defined as 'changes within the 
  forest that negatively affect the structure or function of the stand or site, 
  and thereby lower its capacity to supply products and/or services' (FAO 2001a). 
  In 1999, the FAO reported that 10.5 per cent of Africa's forests had been lost 
  between 1980 and 1995, the highest rate in the developing world and in sharp 
  contrast to the net afforestation seen in developed countries. Forest loss between 
  1990 and 2000 was over 50 million hectares, representing an average deforestation 
  rate of nearly 0.8 per cent per year over this period (FAO 2001a). As a consequence, 
  availability of forest resources per capita declined from 1.22ha/person in 1980 
  to 0.74ha/person in 1995 (African Development Bank 2001). A regional comparison 
  of changes in forest area is shown in <a href="#fig2d4">Figure 2d.4</a>. Deforestation 
  can have a number of negative impacts on local agricultural production (see 
  <a href="#fig2d5">Figure 2d.5</a>).</p>
<p>The pressures causing this decline are complex and operate at several different 
  levels. They may be anthropogenic (caused by humans) or natural, and direct 
  or indirect. Direct causes include commercial timber production, clearing of 
  land for agriculture and urban expansion, and harvesting of wood for fuel and 
  charcoal. These activities also open up forests by the construction of access 
  roads to logging sites, fragmenting the forests and facilitating further clearance, 
  resource extraction, and grazing by locals and commercial organizations. Forest 
  fragmentation can lead to losses in biodiversity by cutting migratory routes 
  for certain animal species, allowing invasion by alien species or changes in 
  microclimate (UNDP and others). Indirect causes of deforestation include population 
  growth, policies, agreements, legislation, lack of stakeholder participation 
  and market factors that encourage the use of forest products leading to loss, 
  fragmentation or degradation (Rodgers, Salehe & Olson 2000). Other causes of 
  forest loss include conflicts, civil wars and lack of good governance (Verolme 
  & Moussa 1999).</p>
<p>Commercial logging has caused the greatest rates of deforestation in Africa 
  in the past 30 years or more, with governments hard-pressed to earn foreign 
  currencies and stimulate their economies. The global demand for roundwood is 
  set to increase by 1.7 per cent per year over the next decade and implementation 
  of more sustainable harvesting methods is therefore a priority to prevent further 
  deforestation (FAO 1999). Local processing and export of value-added products 
  could raise export revenues and employment in timberproducing countries.</p>
<p>After commercial logging, consumption of wood as fuel is a major contributor 
  to reduced forest cover and quality. Africa is the world's largest consumer 
  of biomass energy (as a percentage of total energy consumption), which is largely 
  wood and charcoal (see <a href="#fig2d6">Figure 2d.6</a>). Biomass consumption 
  accounts for 5 per cent of total energy consumption in Northern Africa, 15 per 
  cent in South Africa, and 86 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa excluding South 
  Africa (EIA 1999). The demand for wood and charcoal in Africa is set to increase 
  by over 45 per cent over the next 30 years, due to increases in population and 
  demand for energy (FAO 2001b). Overharvesting of wood for fuel and charcoal 
  production brings changes to the species composition of a forest or savanna. 
  Local people are impacted by having to spend longer and search further to meet 
  their daily fuel requirements. Development of alternative sources of energy 
  is therefore a priority for the African region, and should be facilitated-for 
  example, under the funding mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>Slash and burn agriculture is another human activity contributing to declining 
  forest cover and quality in Africa. This practice depletes the rich fertile 
  forest soils of nutrients, and farming communities using this method have therefore 
  traditionally shifted locations. However, the large and growing rural populations 
  in Africa are making such shifts impossible and this breakdown in traditional 
  management techniques is threatening the remaining forests with increasing rates 
  of clearance and insufficient recovery time. Commercial agriculture, especially 
  plantation agriculture, is also playing a significant part in this cycle of 
  forest loss and soil depletion.</p>
<p>Natural causes of forest and woodland loss, fragmentation or degradation include 
  landslides, volcanism, fire, wind, pests and changes in water tables that change 
  the salinity of soils (IPCC 2000, Medley & Hughes 1996). Other natural causes 
  are river meanders cutting off areas of riverine forest from the river, after 
  which they degrade, and large herbivores such as elephants and rhino which can 
  change the understorey vegetation and the composition of the forest or woodland 
  community (Medley & Hughes 1996, Western 1997). Mangrove forests can undergo 
  change as a result of pests, sedimentation, newly formed sand dunes, high marine 
  pollution levels, and rises in sea levels (Wass 1995).</p>
<p>These natural events can also be precipitated, aggravated or in some cases 
  mitigated by human activity. For example, landslides can be caused by loss of 
  ground cover through clearing for agriculture or cutting of timber for commercial 
  purposes, roads or mining activities. Fires can start in other areas through 
  human activity, and then spread to forests. On the other hand, burning can also 
  improve regeneration of some tree species (Medley & Hughes 1996). Changes in 
  water tables or in salinity can be caused by clearing of trees, irrigation or 
  interference with the hydrology of an area, including rivers flows. Large herbivores 
  (such as elephant and rhino) may degrade their habitat if the size of continuous 
  habitat is reduced. On the other hand, if these animals are excluded, seed dispersal 
  and propagation of certain species may be interrupted (Ganzhorn, Fietz, Rakotovao, 
  Schwab & Zinner 1999). Pests can become a problem if alien species are introduced 
  by human activities, or if the predator-prey balance is disrupted by agrochemicals 
  or other agents. Interestingly, some traditional activities, such as livestock 
  grazing have been shown to control a serious pest (the bruchid beetle) on Acacia 
  <i>tortilis </i>trees (Medley & Hughes 1996).</p>
<p>Fragmentation of forests exposes species adapted to the sheltered, moist, dark 
  forest interior to greater intensities of sunlight, greater wind speeds, or 
  increased levels of predation, reducing the number of species available to local 
  communities, both at present and in the future. The pace and duration of the 
  decline in species richness in forest fragments has been difficult to establish, 
  but fragments of tropical rainforest are high priority conservation areas as 
  they could form the basis for the regeneration of larger areas of forest (Turner 
  & Corlett 1996).<br clear="all">
