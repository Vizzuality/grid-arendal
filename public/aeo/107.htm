<h3>HARVESTING OF COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES IN EASTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Eastern Africa is unusual in that its coastal fish production is low in relation 
  to the surface area and potential productivity of its fisheries, in spite of 
  large amounts of nutrients made available by coastal upwelling resulting from 
  the Somali Current. The coastal fishery yield for the entire eastern and south-eastern 
  African coast, including the Western Indian Ocean Islands, represents less than 
  1 per cent of global landings and most of the coastal fish stocks of the subregion 
  are considered to be fully exploited or overexploited (FAO 1997).</p>
<p>Destructive fishing practices pose a threat to coastal fisheries and coral 
  reefs. Use of dynamite, pullseine nets, poisons, and heavy pressure on selected 
  species and juveniles are widespread along the Eastern African coast, contributing 
  to decline of the ecosystem. However, national and international pressure to 
  ban these practices has stimulated the empowerment of local communities to monitor 
  and manage their resources (Obura, Suleiman, Motta & Schleyer 2000).</p>
<p>The countries of the Eastern African coast are the main exploiters of their 
  coastal waters, but their EEZ is being increasingly harvested by foreign fleets 
  from Europe and Eastern Asia. Somalia is experiencing an extreme case of this, 
  as outlined in <a href="#box2c2">Box 2c.2</a>. Reported catches by foreign nations 
  increased dramatically in the early 1990s, with the Republic of Korea, Japan, 
  France, Taiwan and Spain playing a major role (Okemwa 1998). Shark populations 
  are declining rapidly with consequent drops in shark-fin catches by fishermen 
  from Yemen, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan. Most shark fishing is illegal and also 
  impacts on turtles, dolphins and finfish which get caught in the nets and lines. 
  Lack of surveillance and enforcement is a contributing factor (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 
  2000).</p>

            <p>Somalia has one of the longest coastlines of any African country-around 
              3 300 km. Highly productive upwelling provides significant potential 
              for the development of offshore tuna fisheries. However, the fall 
              of Somalia's government, in 1991, left the country without a central 
              government or control of its waters. Control has been assumed by 
              self-promoted militia, some of whom have made controversial fishing 
              arrangements with foreign countries, whilst others operate like 
              pirates demanding ransoms from foreign vessels. Although these are 
              highly dangerous waters, access to Somali fisheries is now virtually 
              open, driven principally by foreign interests and demand for high-value 
              tuna, shark and ray fins, lobster, deepwater shrimp and demersal 
              whitefish. Harvesting rates are thus not known and it is not possible 
              to determine whether marine resources are being harvested sustainably 
              or not. Furthermore, the years of civil conflict have damaged the 
              fisheries infrastructure, and have reduced previous oil spill response 
              capability, aids to navigation, and search and rescue capacity.</p>
            <p>Somalia is party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
              Species (CITES), UNCLOS, and the Nairobi and Jeddah Regional Seas 
              Conventions. However, few of the provisions of these treaties are 
              being implemented since the breakdown of national governance, and 
              Somalia is looking to the international community to assist with 
              implementation and enforcement of regulations. The current challenge 
              is to develop a regional institutional proposal to address the situation.</p>

<h4>Sustainable harvesting of coastal and marine resources in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Eastern African countries are party to the 1982 UNCLOS which establishes fishing 
  rights, and to international agreements on harvesting limits and areas. However, 
  countries in the sub-region, like many African countries, lack both the infrastructure 
  to exploit their own territories and the capacity to police and monitor the 
  activities of international fleets or unsustainable harvesting rates. In addition, 
  fishing agreements with foreign countries have been poorly defined, based on 
  the need by African states for income and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In Eritrea, marine resource harvesting is being regulated as peace returns 
  to the area, through development of formal management procedures. Similar efforts 
  are anticipated in Somalia. In Kenya, the MPA system is managed by the Kenya 
  Wildlife Service and extends over 5 per cent of the coastline. There are two 
  types of protection: full protection in marine parks, and the traditional resource 
  harvesting allowed in marine reserves. Tourism is the main activity at all sites, 
  and plans are underway to involve local communities and other stakeholders in 
  the management of some areas (Obura and others 2000).</p>
