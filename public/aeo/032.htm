<h2>REGIONAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Africa is faced with three major issues where the atmosphere is concerned, 
  namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>climate variability;</li>
  <li>climate change; and</li>
  <li>air quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Climate variability means the seasonal and annual variations in temperature 
  and rainfall patterns within and between regions or countries. For Africa, it 
  is determined by prevailing patterns of sea surface temperature, atmospheric 
  winds, regional climate fluctuations in the India and Atlantic Oceans, and by 
  the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon-the natural shift in ocean 
  currents and winds off the coast of South America which occurs every two to 
  seven years. ENSO events bring above average rainfall to some regions and reduced 
  rainfall to others.</p>
<p>Africa is characterized by considerable climatic variations, both spatial and 
  temporal, and extreme events such as flooding and drought have been recorded 
  for thousands of years (Verschuren, Laird & Cumming 2000). The equatorial belt 
  generally has high rainfall, whereas northern and southern African countries 
  and those in the Horn of Africa are typically arid or semi-arid (see <a href="#fig2a1">Figure 
  2a.1</a>). All parts of Africa, even those that usually have high rainfall, 
  experience climatic variability and extreme events such as floods or droughts. 
  Most of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa, as well as the Western Indian 
  Ocean Islands, are affected by the ENSO phenomenon. The 1997-8 ENSO triggered 
  very high sea surface temperatures in the south-western Indian Ocean causing 
  high rainfall, cyclones, flooding and landslides across most of Eastern Africa 
  whereas south-western Africa experienced drier conditions. The higher sea temperatures 
  also caused extensive bleaching of corals on the Eastern African coast and in 
  the Western Indian Ocean Islands (Obura, Suleiman, Motta, & Schleyer 2000, PRE/COI 
  1998).</p>
<p>Rainfall records from the early 1900s to mid-1980s show that Africa's average 
  annual rainfall has decreased since 1968, and has been fluctuating around a 
  notably lower mean level, as shown in <a href="#fig2a2">Figure 2a.2</a> (UNEP 
  1985). There is also some evidence that natural disasters have increased in 
  frequency and severity over the past 30 years, particularly drought in the Sahel 
  (OFDA 2000). The most prolonged and widespread droughts occurred in 1973 and 
  1984 (when almost all African countries were affected) and in 1992, although 
  in this case drought was mainly restricted to Southern Africa. The impacts of 
  the 1984 and 1992 droughts were alleviated to some extent by increased preparedness 
  of some countries, even though the droughts themselves were more severe (Gommes 
  & Petrassi 1996). Countries most regularly affected by drought include Botswana, 
  Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritania and Mozambique (FAO 2001a).</p>

<p>Human activities such as deforestation and inappropriate management of land 
  and water resources can contribute to the frequency and impacts of natural climatic 
  events. For example, clearing of tropical forests in Central and Western Africa 
  alters local climate and rainfall patterns and increases the risk of drought. 
  Clearing of vegetation increases run-off and soil erosion, and damming of rivers 
  and draining of wetlands reduces the environment's natural ability to absorb 
  excess water, increasing the impacts of floods.</p>
<p>Africa's people and economies are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture 
  (for commercial export and subsistence) and are therefore vulnerable to rainfall 
  fluctuations. It is usually the poor who suffer most from flood- or drought-induced 
  crop failure, as they are forced to cultivate marginally productive land and 
  cannot accumulate reserves for times of hardship. Malnutrition and famine have 
  resulted from both droughts and floods in Africa and associated food imports 
  and dependency on food aid have contributed to limited economic growth of the 
  countries affected. Additional impacts include loss of infrastructure and disruption 
  of economic activities, outbreaks of disease and sometimes population displacements, 
  both internal and international. Over the past 30 years, millions of Africans 
  have sought refuge from natural disasters, often settling in fragile ecosystems 
  and/or experiencing social tensions with neighbouring communities. Ecological 
  impacts of drought and flooding include land degradation and desertification, 
  loss of natural habitat or changes in distribution of biodiversity, increased 
  soil erosion and silting of rivers, dams, and coastal ecosystems.</p>
