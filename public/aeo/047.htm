<p><a name="img2a4"></a>The Western Indian Ocean Islands lie between the tropics, 
  with the exception of a small part of Madagascar which falls south of the tropic 
  of Capricorn. They are subject to about ten tropical storms or cyclones each 
  year in the period between November and May (four per year in Madagascar). The 
  sub-region also experiences inter-annual variations in rainfall as well as periodic 
  flooding and droughts.</p>
<p>Although early warning systems are well developed in the Western Indian Ocean 
  Islands, the threat of increased climate variability and of sea level rise, 
  arising from climate change, are issues of priority and concern.</p>
<p>Air pollution in urban areas is emerging as a problem for human health and 
  for the sub-region's ecology. Preventive action is required.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>Cyclones-with high winds gusting at over 200 km/hour-demolish lightweight buildings, 
  damage overhead cables, uproot trees, and are a threat to life and property. 
  Cyclones also cause heavy swells in the Western Indian Ocean which in turn cause 
  significant rises in sea levels that affect coastal infrastructures such as 
  roads and settlements, undermine beach stability, and cause vertical scouring 
  of up to two metres (Ragoonaden 1997). The heavy rains resulting from cyclones 
  cause destruction of crops and vegetation, flooding, soil erosion and contamination 
  of freshwater supplies, with risk to humans and to animal life. At the height 
  of a cyclone most outdoor human activity comes to a halt, schools and workplaces 
  close down, emergency shelter has to be found for those whose homes are destroyed 
  or damaged, and calls are issued for community aid programmes.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of a cyclone, communities may be temporarily prevented from 
  returning to normal activity because people, domestic animals, crops, services 
  and buildings have been lost (UNEP 1999). In some cases the damage may be so 
  severe that countries are obliged to seek international relief aid. Madagascar 
  is an example of this (FAO 1984, UNDHA 1994).</p>
<p>The ENSO phenomenon is also a major factor in climate variability in the sub-region, 
  causing floods and droughts. Mauritius, for example, is prone to drought, especially 
  in the dry season, while Madagascar is most affected by desertification, with 
  sandstorms that cause sand dunes to invade the interior along the coast, covering 
  houses and crops (UNEP 1999). In these countries and elsewhere in the sub-region, 
  the pressure of an increasing population is resulting in the use of marginal 
  land close to rivers, of sand dunes and of land reclaimed from the sea for residential 
  and industrial purposes. Conditions in these marginal or reclaimed lands are 
  more precarious than in other areas, and such encroachment puts more people 
  and jobs at risk from the effects of climate change and natural disasters.</p>
<p>Coral reefs in the sub-region are also at risk. In 1997 and 1998, the ENSO 
  phenomenon caused abnormal increases in sea and air temperatures that led to 
  bleaching and death of coral reefs. In Seychelles, more than 80 per cent of 
  coral reefs were lost and, in the same period, a prolonged drought caused temporary 
  closure of the Seychelles Breweries and the Indian Ocean Tuna Company (UNEP 
  1999).</p>

              between 6 and 12 hours before it hits, and once the windspeed reaches 
              120 km/hr. There are fully equipped shelters and emergency procedures 
              that are tested regularly. Plentiful advice on stocking up with 
              provisions and water is also given.</p>

<p><a name="box2a3"></a>Cyclones cannot be controlled, but their impacts on lives, 
  livelihoods, crops and infrastructure can be minimized through adequate preparation 
  and efficient, accurate warnings by meteorological services. For example, Mauritius 
  has a cyclone warning system that was established in the 1950s, at a time when 
  the island's economy was dominated by sugar production (a crop highly vulnerable 
  to the wind and rain damage associated with cyclones). The subsequent rapid 
  growth in the country's population and its economic and agricultural development 
  mean that more people and infrastructure are now at risk from cyclone impacts 
  and the system is used to give a series of warnings allowing for preparations 
  or evacuation (see <a href="#box2a3">Box 2a.3</a>). The regional Tropical Cyclone 
  Warning System in the southwest Indian Ocean is also being upgraded and observation 
  and telecommunications systems are being enhanced. Meteorologists and hydrologists 
  are being given advanced training on early warning systems.</p>
<p>Cyclone-proof buildings are becoming a common feature in the sub-region (incidentally 
  creating a demand for building sand which, as it is often dug from beaches, 
  exacerbates erosion and damage to the delicate reef ecology). Wind resistant 
  crops are also being developed on the islands.</p>
<p>Regional programmes can contribute to better protection from and response to 
  crises, but effective intra-regional collaboration is vital to ensure sharing 
  of technical skills, training, information, research, and collaboration in response.</p>
