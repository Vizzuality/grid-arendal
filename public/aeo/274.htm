<h4>The narratives</h4>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, market forces are the main determinants of: 
  economic and social relations; the distribution of welfare, goods and services; 
  the pattern of investment; and the development of human resources and institutions. 
  Barriers to trade and to the movement of capital gradually diminish. In the 
  emerging free-market economy, markets for goods, services and labour become 
  increasingly interconnected and more integrated; unfettered financial flows 
  and free trade facilitate this. Competition for markets and private investment 
  stimulate initiative and become the main engines of economic growth. To promote 
  market openness and global competition, new institutional arrangements are forged. 
  Consumerism, individualism and self-centredness spread. Inequalities in the 
  distribution of, and access to, the benefits of globalization grow at all levels: 
  among individuals, communities, regions and nations. Overall, these patterns 
  largely continue the global trends that have shaped much of the world economy 
  over the past few decades and more.</p>
<p>Social and environmental stresses are resolved largely through incremental 
  market and policy adaptations. Economic growth is expected to pay for the maintenance 
  and repair costs of environmental damage incurred in the course of economic 
  development. As such, policy makers are not encouraged to design mutually supportive 
  environmental and trade policies, with the result that there is little or no 
  strategic planning of environmental policies to mitigate the negative and to 
  enhance the positive effects of rapid economic development.</p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, as the economic and social patterns and behaviours 
  of developing countries converge towards those of the industrialized countries, 
  no fundamental novel transformations, surprises or sharp discontinuities occur. 
  Africa's future becomes increasingly shaped by the evolving patterns of globalization, 
  and influenced by the dominant values, and social and economic relationships, 
  of industrialized societies. Countries in Africa become increasingly integrated-nationally, 
  regionally and internationally- as advances in communication systems, IT and 
  the electronic media shorten both distance and time. Relations between people 
  in different parts of Africa and across the world become more direct and immediate. 
  Africa becomes part of the 'global village', connected through flows of knowledge 
  and information, and stimulated by this to become more aware of, and active 
  in, the global marketplace.</p>
<p>Despite increasing globalization, the nation state remains the dominant unit 
  of governance, though national decision making is somewhat circumscribed by 
  international treaties, agreements and obligations. Regional economic groupings 
  emerge to pursue common development objectives. Examples are the establishment 
  of economic trading blocks, such as: the Arab Magreb Union (AMU) in north Africa; 
  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS ) in west Africa; the 
  Economic Community of Central African States (ECOAS) in central Africa; the 
  South African Development Community (SADC) in southern Africa; the Indian Ocean 
  Community for the West Indian Ocean Community (IOC); and the Common Market for 
  Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). There are other economic groupings, such 
  as the formation of the Southern African Power Pool.</p>
<p>The participation of people, the private sector and non-governmental organizations 
  (NGOs) in development continues to increase, however, as governments are encouraged 
  to become more open, transparent, tolerant and democratic. Most national governments 
  advance policy packages, which include steps to modernize the economies and 
  financial systems of their countries, and to increase investment in education, 
  in order to develop human resources and to improve their competitiveness in 
  the global markets.</p>
<p>Many governments also privatize state enterprises in order to improve efficiency 
  productivity and to reduce public expenditure. Nevertheless, pockets of resistance 
  to these changes remain, and are characterized by corruption, nepotism and economic 
  failure. As the welfare of populations is increasingly determined by the extent 
  of their integration into a liberalized global market, countries which fail 
  to embrace these changes fall further behind, both economically and in other 
  ways.</p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, pressures of a growing population are not just 
  confined to land-based resources. The demand for water increases-a consequence 
  both of more people overall, and greater demand for water for agricultural, 
  industrial and urban domestic uses. In an attempt to meet these demands, more 
  dams are built and more groundwater is extracted. This localizes the distribution 
  of surface water, and increases the cost of provision and distribution. Groundwater 
  levels decline, amplifying the cost of extraction. Water pricing is introduced 
  in order to recoup the costs of supply and to establish a mechanism for the 
  economically efficient allocation of a limited resource. As water becomes more 
  valuable, water recycling is encouraged. Pollution of water bodies by agricultural, 
  industrial and domestic effluents is gradually regulated, though this takes 
  some time to work efficiently. Despite these advances, however, a majority of 
  people in many of the drier regions of the region remain short of water.</p>
<p>Given the continued prevalence of poverty in Africa, both as a result of the 
  slow spread of economic benefits of globalization and the continued growth in 
  the number of people in the lower socioeconomic strata, many countries in Africa 
  continue to rely on foreign aid and external economic assistance. Foreign debt 
  continues to increase, creating more pressure for export-led economic development, 
  based primarily on the extraction of natural resources. The prospect of debt 
  relief encourages economic structural adjustment and increased democratization, 
  but the sustainability of these changes remains an open question.</p>
<p>The close juxtaposition of an expanding global culture and the largely conservative, 
  traditional cultures of the region heightens social stresses. This is particularly 
  the case between the younger members of society, who are more exposed to global 
  culture, and their elders, for whom such changes seem to be a threat. These 
  stresses are somewhat exacerbated by the fact that authority within communities 
  is exercised largely by the elders in circumstances of change which, unlike 
  the young, they resist embracing. Changes in social relationships within families, 
  resulting from differences in education, lifestyle and location, cause the traditional 
  support systems to break down.</p>
