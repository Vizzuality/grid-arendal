<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Southern Africa is mostly semi-arid, and experiences variation in rainfall, 
  both over time and between countries. This sub-region is also expected to experience 
  further variability in rainfall, reduced precipitation and increased evaporation, 
  as a result of climate change. With a rapidly growing population, and demands 
  from the domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors for water, freshwater 
  availability is a priority concern for the sub-region. Discriminatory access 
  policies and pricing systems have also skewed the distribution of access to 
  water resources across population groups. An additional concern in the subregion 
  is declining water quality due to domestic and industrial pollution, and eutrophication 
  and salinization due to agricultural pollution.</p>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Southern Africa's annual average surface water resources are approximately 
  534 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, but they are distributed unevenly due to: frequently 
  low and variable rainfall; terrain; evaporation rates; and vegetation and soil 
  cover. For example, Angola, the wettest country in the sub-region, has average 
  annual internal water resources of 184 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (14 000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr), 
  and Mozambique and Zambia have 100 km<sup>3</sup>/yr and 80 km<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  respectively (5 000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr and 8 700m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr). 
  By contrast, the driest countries, Botswana and Namibia, have just 2.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  and 6.2 km<sup>3</sup>/yr respectively (1 700m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr and 3 500m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr 
  respectively) (UNDP and others 2000). </p>
<p>The areas of low rainfall are in many cases also coincidental with areas of 
  highest evaporation potential, and variability in rainfall can result in periodic 
  episodes of severe and prolonged droughts, particularly in the southwest. In 
  these areas, groundwater resources are particularly important (see <a href="#box2e7">Box 
  2e.7</a>). By contrast, the northern and eastern areas are subject to occasional 
  floods, the most recent example being in 1999-2000. The excessive rains of this 
  season affected Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Some 
  200 000 ha of cropland were flooded and more than 150 000 families were affected. 
  The estimated cost of recovery is millions of US dollars (Mpofu 2000). Although 
  the SADC Early Warning System was able to predict the heavy rains, most countries 
  were ill-prepared for the magnitude and duration of the floods, stimulating 
  investigations and revisions of response strategies.</p>

            <p>Groundwater is the main source of water for about 60 per cent of 
              both rural and urban residents throughout southern Africa. A large 
              part of the subregion is characterized by small towns, villages 
              and dispersed rural settlements. Thus, access to reticulated surface 
              water resources has been limited because of the high costs and long 
              distances that need to be covered in order to establish infrastructure 
              for formal water services. The sustainable management of groundwater 
              is, therefore, important for rural livelihoods in the sub-region, 
              even though the proportion of water coming from groundwater sources 
              is relatively small.</p>

<p>The sub-region's largest freshwater lake, and the third largest lake in Africa, 
  is Lake Malawi, with a surface area of 31 000 km<sup>2</sup>. The lake is important 
  in terms of fishing activities and the tourist industry which it supports. Lake 
  Malawi has the largest number of fish species of any lake in the world, estimated 
  at more than 500 species, of which 90 per cent are thought to be unique to the 
  lake. The most important species biologically, and in terms of local livelihoods, 
  are the 400 or more cichlid species, of which all but five are endemic to Lake 
  Malawi (Ribbink, Marsh, Ribbink and Sharp 1983). Because of this extraordinary 
  biodiversity, the southern part of the lake is registered as a national park, 
  and was established as a Natural World Heritage Site in 1984. Major rivers include 
  the Zambezi River, whose basin is shared by eight southern African countries 
  and is home to 40 million people. The Zambezi basin also supports many local 
  communities, as well as commercial agriculture and forestry, manufacturing and 
  mining, conservation and tourism (Chenje 2000).</p>
<p>A study of the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources 
  in southern Africa predicts an overall reduction in rainfall, by as much as 
  10 per cent across the whole sub-region, and up to 20 per cent in parts of South 
  Africa (WWF 2000). Evaporation rates will increase by 5-20 per cent, as a result 
  of raised temperatures, which will reduce run-off, and decrease water security 
  and agricultural potential. Coincident with this will be increases in the frequency 
  and intensity of flooding and drought (WWF 2000). In addition to variability 
  and long-term decline in precipitation, water resources development is further 
  complicated by the uneven distribution of population-particularly, high population 
  densities in arid areas. Per capita average annual water resources in Angola, 
  for example, exceeds 14 000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr whereas, in South Africa, 
  each person has only slightly more than 1 000 m<sup>3</sup> per year (UNDP and 
  others 2000).</p>
<p>Environmental degradation is a further contributor to decline in water availability, 
  through loss of vegetation, and the disruption of microclimates and hydrological 
  cycles. Dense stands of alien vegetation in southern Africa are particularly 
  disruptive in this regard, because they use much larger amounts of water than 
  indigenous species (see <a href="#box2e8">Box 2e.8</a>). In some areas of southern 
  Africa, up to 50 per cent of wetlands have been transformed, and the Caprivi 
  wetland system (Namibia) has been reduced to almost 25 per cent of its original 
  size. This has been due to: draining of wetlands, for agricultural or infrastructure 
  development; reduced flows; aquatic weeds choking water courses; increasing 
  use of pesticides; and overextraction of reeds, wood and other materials for 
  construction, weaving and crafts (Chenje 2000). Wetlands act as sponges, absorbing 
  excess water in times of heavy rainfall and, thus, buffering the effects of 
  flooding. To prevent further degradation of these important habitats, two countries 
  of the sub-region, South Africa and Zambia, are parties to the 1971 Ramsar Convention, 
  and have designated certain areas as Wetlands of International Importance.</p>

            <p>Alien invasive vegetation is a significant and growing problem 
              in many areas of southern Africa, especially in riparian zones. 
              The water hyacinth (<i>Eichornia crassipes</i>) is choking many 
              water bodies in South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and 
              exotic timber species, such as pines (<i>Pinus </i>sp.) wattles 
              (<i>Acacia </i>sp.) and eucalypts (<i>Eucalyptus </i>sp) take up 
              more water than indigenous species, thereby reducing mean annual 
              run-off. Zimbabwe and South Africa have initiated biological and 
              chemical control programmes for the water hyacinth, with some success 
              to date. South Africa's Working for Water Programme, launched in 
              1995, is a nationwide alien plant control programme, building capacity, 
              and generating employment and incomes among some of the country's 
              poorest communities. The programme uses mechanical, chemical and 
              biological control methods and, during 2000, the teams cleared 238 
              000 ha and rehabilitated 51 000 ha of land which was infested with 
              alien vegetation. The activities of that year employed 21 000 people.</p>
