<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>The range of climatic conditions and geomorphology found in Africa has created 
  a wide diversity of habitats, which various species of flora and fauna have 
  evolved to exploit. As a result, the region is exceedingly well endowed with 
  diverse biological resources. The forests of Africa are particularly diverse 
  and support many millions of Africans by providing them with food, clothing 
  and construction materials, medicinal products, and cultural and recreational 
  facilities. However, in many cases the value of these resources is undetermined 
  because they are not traded on the open market. Other products, such as timber 
  are commercially traded and make substantial contributions to GDPs. Studies 
  have estimated the value of biological resources to be millions of dollars every 
  year.</p>
<p>Africa's biodiversity has been subjected to increasing pressures of habitat 
  loss (through conversion of natural habitats to urban, industrial or agricultural 
  uses), overharvesting (due to increasing population and rising consumption levels), 
  pollution (from urban and industrial sources), and the introduction of alien 
  species (which dominate and alter habitat conditions). These pressures are set 
  to continue and intensify over the next decade or two because of rapid population 
  growth and extensive use of natural resources in most economic activities. At 
  the root of this, however, is a lack of proper valuation of natural resources. 
  In many cases, resources are not perceived to be limited and are therefore consumed 
  as if they were 'free', rather than being consumed sustainably, i.e. leaving 
  sufficient resources in the system to regenerate or reproduce and thus ensure 
  a continued supply.</p>
<p>Traditionally, African societies recognized the importance of biological resources, 
  and employed traditional conservation measures. Under colonial administrations 
  the perceived solution to habitat loss was to declare nationally protected areas 
  and ban all or most activities. The current rate of species extinctions all 
  across the Africa region testifies that this approach is insufficient. Traditional 
  knowledge and practices must be re-incorporated into regional conservation strategies, 
  and communities and commercial companies must be provided with alternative resources 
  or means of production. Simply excluding activities from one area intensifies 
  the pressure on other areas and resources. Community conservation, or community 
  based natural resource management can take a variety of forms, and presents 
  a range of options. It is likely to be more successful where care has been taken 
  to understand the situation faced by each community, and to apply a strategy 
  that best fits the circumstances (Adams & Hulme 2001). Ratification of international 
  conventions and establishment of regional action plans is a measure of political 
  commitment to resolving these issues, but needs to be supported with human and 
  financial resources not just to comply with obligations, but to implement activities 
  and projects at the national and sub-national level. It is important to take 
  into account the inequalities and local costs that form the basis for losses 
  of biodiversity, and to avoid the temptation of trying to rely entirely on free-market 
  economics (Western 2001) Win-win situations must be developed in order to sustain 
  livelihoods and economies while retaining a biological resource base which is 
  intact and functioning properly.</p>
<p>Many of the most valuable biodiversity resources extend beyond national or 
  sub-regional borders. In order to avoid conflicts, and to manage and use these 
  resources sustainably, African countries and subregional groupings must cooperate 
  in devising policies, programmes and projects that harmonize biodiversity management 
  and conservation throughout ecologically determined regions. This calls for 
  a sustained effort on regional integration of environmental management.</p>
