<h4>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality in Southern Africa </h4>
<p>South Africa's Prevention and Combating of Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 
  (1981) provides for the prevention and combating of pollution in South Africa's 
  territorial waters. However, in 1986, responsibility for administration of the 
  Act was divided between the Department of Transport and Environmental Affairs 
  and the Department of Tourism and this has created problems in assigning responsibilities 
  during emergencies and reduced the effectiveness of coordination with community 
  groups (Trevenen-Jones 2000).</p>
<p>Pollution problems are further complicated by lack of awareness and weak policies 
  and institutional frameworks, or legal instruments for enforcing national and 
  international regulations. The most effective means of controlling coastal and 
  marine pollution and degradation is therefore to demonstrate to industry and 
  the public the benefits of maintaining a healthy environment-for example, improved 
  aesthetic qualities and leisure facilities, improved harvests, and increased 
  revenues from tourism. South Africa's Coastal Policy White Paper (from which 
  a draft Bill is to be tabled in the country's parliament in 2002) includes measures 
  to minimize, control, and monitor pollution of coastal waters from point and 
  non-point sources (DEA&T 2000b).</p>
<h5>Towards ICZM in Southern Africa</h5>
<p>Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania participate in the UNEP Regional Seas 
  Programme for Eastern Africa, and have ratified the Nairobi Convention. Under 
  the convention, several capacity-building exercises have taken place in the 
  sub-region and countries are well on their way to developing and implementing 
  national ICZM policies and programmes. Angola and Namibia come under the UNEP 
  Regional Seas Programme for West and Central Africa and have signed the Action 
  Plan and Abidjan Convention, in 1981. South Africa has also shown interest in 
  participating in implementation of the Abidjan Convention.</p>
<p>Angola Namibia and South Africa, the three countries bordering on the Benguela 
  Current Large Marine Ecosystem, have initiated a cooperative management plan 
  designed to overcome previous fragmentation in coastal zone management and to 
  ensure integrated and sustainable development of coastal and marine resources. 
  Improved understanding through research and monitoring, together with increased 
  capacity and resources, is critical to successful implementation of the plans 
  (O'Toole, Shannon, de Barros Neto & Malan 2001).</p>
<p>Countries on the east coast of Southern Africa have been actively involved 
  in cooperation for improved coastal zone management, including a meeting of 
  Ministers of the Environment from east-coast African states, in Seychelles in 
  1996. A Secretariat for Eastern Africa Coastal Area Management (SEACAM) was 
  established at the meeting, to assist countries in implementing ICZM. Achievements 
  under this cooperative arrangement include training workshops and publication 
  of training manuals, development of an Eastern Africa Coastal Management database, 
  information dissemination via newsletters, a website, distribution of documents, 
  and participation in international conferences.</p>
<p>At the national level, all countries in the sub-region are in the process of 
  developing ICZM policies. For example, the Marine Research Institute in Angola 
  currently has a number of research programmes aimed at improving understanding 
  of the living marine resources in order to provide management recommendations 
  to the Ministry of Fisheries. However, lack of funding is limiting the activities 
  of research vessels and laboratory operations. Capacity is being enhanced in 
  coastal and marine resource management through university courses and at two 
  Maritime Technical Schools. Mozambique developed a national ICZM policy and 
  programme in 1998 and has since implemented environmental legislation. ICZM 
  projects are also being conducted in Namibia for particularly sensitive regions 
  of the coast such as the Erongo region. South Africa is expected to pass a draft 
  Bill relevant to ICZM through its parliament in 2002 (see above), and Tanzania 
  developed a Green Paper in 1999.</p>
