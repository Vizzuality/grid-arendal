<h4>Management of pollution and waste in Central Africa</h4>
<p>Solid waste generation in Central Africa was recorded in 1993 as 0.6 kg/person/day 
  in Brazzaville, 0.8 kg/person/day in Yaoundé, and 1.2 kg/person/day in Kinshasa 
  (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNDP, UNEP & World Bank 1998). Relatively few households 
  had access to solid waste collection, however, (none in Kinshasa, one-quarter 
  in Bangui (Central African Republic), and 44 per cent in Yaoundé). Residents 
  of Douala and Brazzaville fared better, with 60 and 72 per cent respectively 
  (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNDP, UNEP & World Bank 1998).</p>
<p>The lack of capacity to collect, treat, and dispose of solid waste stems from 
  inadequate municipal budgets and insufficient sites. In many cases, refuse collection 
  is restricted to high-income areas. Where refuse is collected, it is often dumped 
  at the edge of the city in open sites such as wetlands or water courses, rather 
  than in regulated landfill sites. Whereas 62 per cent of Douala's solid waste 
  and 70 per cent of Libreville's waste is disposed of in sanitary landfill, the 
  figure for Brazzaville is less than one per cent, and 40 per cent goes to open 
  dumps (UNCHS 2001c). Here it poses a health risk to rubbish pickers, and to 
  the water supply system, through leaching of toxic and decomposing material 
  and blocking of drainage channels. Furthermore, 38 per cent of Brazzaville's 
  waste and 32 per cent of Kinshasa's waste are burned in the open, posing a further 
  risk to human and environmental health though the emission of toxic fumes (UNCHS 
  2001c). Very little is recycled, as infrastructure and services for collection 
  and recycling have not been established and there are few markets for recycled 
  materials.</p>
<p>The responses adopted by countries in the subregion to address waste management 
  problems include improved urban planning and management, establishment of programmes 
  for waste disposal, and enforcement of existing regulations, urban environmental 
  education, monitoring, and community participation as well as involvement of 
  the private sector in urban sanitation. Libreville municipality has launched 
  a 'Clean City' campaign, and local environmental plans have been implemented 
  to improve environmental and social conditions. However, lack of legislation 
  empowering local authorities and lack of assistance in transfer of state funds 
  to municipalities remain barriers to their effectiveness (UNCHS 2001c).</p>
<p>Air pollution is an emerging issue in urban centres of Central Africa, although 
  few data are available at present to provide quantitative analysis of the sources 
  or impacts. Sources of pollution include increasing vehicular traffic and advanced 
  age of many vehicles, industrial activity, and household consumption of traditional 
  fuels. Lack of connection to electricity supply forces many households to burn 
  coal, wood or even refuse to provide energy for heating and cooking. These fuels 
  give off toxic fumes and are dangerous to human health, causing respiratory 
  disorders.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in Central Africa</h4>
<p>In Cameroon, the government has embarked on a decentralization process, and 
  there has been increased community participation, especially in implementation 
  of projects aimed at improving living conditions (UNCHS 2001c). At the recent 
  25th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Istanbul+5 Conference 
  in June 2001, Cameroon also reported that it had put in place an environmental 
  management strategy for urban development. Additional national programmes recently 
  developed include a programme for poverty reduction, environmental protection, 
  governance, and health, fertility and nutrition. However, no assessment of the 
  performance of these actions was available at the time of writing. The Congolese 
  delegation reported that the human settlement development strategy has four 
  major components, namely security of tenure, adequate housing for all, promotion 
  of equality in access to credit, and provision of essential services. However, 
  attention so far has been focussed on reconstruction and post-conflict development, 
  and there is still significant work to do to achieve the goals of this strategy. 
  Gabon noted that a national Habitat committee had been established, partnerships 
  between national and local government and civil society had been forged, and 
  community infrastructure projects had been implemented with financial assistance 
  from the World Bank.</p>
