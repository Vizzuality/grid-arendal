<a name="box42"></a>The vision of the Great Transitions scenario stems from developments 
at the start of the new millennium. These include a conviction regarding the need 
to embrace a new sustainability paradigm-one which transcends the dictates of 
both the Market Forces scenario and the Policy Reform scenario and one which, 
at the same time, prevents the occurrence of the ills associated with the Fortress 
World scenario. Associated with these is a philosophical dimension, at both personal 
and group levels, which holds that an end must be put to consumerism as way of 
life, and that a search must be made for issues that can provide a renewed sense 
of meaning and purpose to life. Consequently, the values of simplicity, tranquillity 
and community begin to displace the values of consumerism, competition and individualism. 
Voluntary reduction in work hours frees time for study, art and hobbies. 
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, lifestyles become simpler, in a material 
  sense, and richer, in a qualitative sense, as the old obsession with possessions 
  gives way to intellectual and artistic pursuits. In the new sustainability paradigm, 
  markets remain critical, in terms of achieving efficiency in the production 
  and allocation of goods, but well-designed policies constrain the level and 
  structure of economic activity, so it remains compatible with social, cultural 
  and environmental goals. A variety of mechanisms enforce these principles, including 
  regulation, international negotiation and market signals, such as revised tax 
  systems which discourage the production of environmental 'bads', and which reward 
  restorative practices. Environmental, economic and social indicators track real 
  progress at all scales-business, regional, national and global-giving the public 
  an informed basis for seeking change.</p>
<p>The assumptions of the Great Transitions Scenario may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neither the Market Forces scenario nor the Policy Reform scenario possesses 
    strategies that are adequate for addressing the ills of the assault on the 
    environment.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, given current trends in the adoption and effectuation of treaties 
    on environmental issues, policies alone cannot be sufficiently effective against 
    social inequities and environmental uncertainty.</li>
  <li>While market forces are not abandoned as a policy tool, social, cultural 
    and environmental goals take precedence in thinking about development.</li>
  <li>For Africa (and perhaps for the whole world), notions of sustainability 
    fundamentally change the values and lifestyles of peoples (an African Renaissance).</li>
  <li>In general, there is a cultural renaissance, which is not only critical 
    of past behaviour and effects on the environment, but which also outlines 
    new ways of thinking, and which fosters environmental goals.</li>
  <li>The affluent, having become disillusioned with consumerism, other ills of 
    society and the negative impacts of development on the environment, undertake 
    steps to develop new values and value systems. These are gradually introduced, 
    and promote a new set of ethics in society.</li>
  <li>A new generation of thinkers, leaders and activists join and shape national 
    and global dialogue towards environmental sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Great Transitions scenario represents a very optimistic view of the development 
  of the environment in Africa, as well as all over the world. Nevertheless, it 
  is not as utopian as it looks at first examination, because its tenets are perfectly 
  achievable, given the right atmosphere. As mentioned in <a href="#box42">Box 
  4.2</a>, and discussed extensively in Beyond Hunger, Africa needs a resurgence 
  at many dimensions. The beginning of the millennium is a good time to start 
  such an exercise. Africa must ask new questions, and must challenge the conventional 
  wisdom that has tied the region down for too long. Africa must be ready for 
  a surprise, rich future.</p>
