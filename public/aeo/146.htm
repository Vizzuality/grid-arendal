<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Approximately 22 per cent of the African continent is covered with forests, 
  ranging from open savanna to closed tropical rainforest. Forests provide a great 
  many goods and services which benefit local communities and national economies, 
  as well as providing international environmental benefits. Commercial forest 
  products include timber for construction and paper, but forest resources provide 
  much more to local communities including food, construction materials, grazing 
  areas for livestock, cultural and medicinal products, sites for religious practices 
  and leisure activities, and fuel for cooking, heating and lighting. Forests 
  protect and stabilize the soil, recycle nutrients to maintain soil quality and 
  regulate water quality and flow. Forests are also vast sinks for atmospheric 
  carbon dioxide, and thus play a critical role in mitigating global climate change 
  the impacts of which are predicted to be most severe for African countries and 
  other developing nations. By protecting soils and by regulating temperatures, 
  rainfall and hydrological systems, forests provide basic support systems for 
  agriculture and industry, and, therefore, for the economies of African nations.</p>

<p>Natural forests and woodlands in Africa have been drastically reduced in size 
  over the last century but particularly so since independence, as countries have 
  struggled to improve their economies through exploitation of natural resources. 
  Deforestation for commercial timber sales and clearance for agricultural and 
  urban developments are the most intensive pressures, as well as overharvesting 
  of wood for fuel, medicinal products, and construction materials. Remaining 
  forests have also been degraded as a result of clear felling, fires, selective 
  harvesting, and encroachment. Impacts of this degradation include losses of 
  biodiversity, radically increased rates of soil erosion, reductions in water 
  quality and increased risk of flooding in surrounding areas, and loss of livelihoods 
  for local communities. The global community has also lost potential pharmaceutical 
  and food products.</p>
<p>Pressures remain even though many countries in Africa have protected forest 
  reserves, initiated reforestation and afforestation programmes, and have developed 
  policies and programmes for sustainable forest management. And those pressures 
  are set to increase with increasing populations and demand for forest resources. 
  The developing countries are struggling to commit the necessary financial and 
  human resources to their efforts in order to be able to turn away much needed 
  foreign exchange proposed in return for further logging concessions. If they 
  are to succeed, the true value of the variety of forest resources and services 
  on which local communities and the global community depend needs to be made 
  explicit and either incorporated into the price of forest products or traded 
  on the open market. Economic and social development priorities need to be integrated 
  into forest conservation measures, so that local communities can share in the 
  management of the resource and in the benefits of trade in their products. This 
  requires further understanding of the types of forests, the complexity of the 
  issues, and establishment of clear objectives and commitment of resources to 
  implementation of sustainable development policies. Essential elements that 
  must be taken into account include recognition of the intrinsic features of 
  the local physical environment, impacts of climate change, deforestation factors, 
  skills in forest management, scarcity of forest resources, deep-rooted traditions 
  and human impacts, economic forces and political events. There must also be 
  concerted efforts to provide alternative sources of energy, more efficient forms 
  of energy utilization (such as mudstoves) and to provide income to people relying 
  on natural forests. The major solutions for forest problems in the region include 
  reforestation of the original and more prosperous areas and afforestation of 
  multipurpose forests that can be used for grazing, wood production and other 
  traditional uses. Establishment of multipurpose forests will diversify outputs, 
  an important asset to avoid overuse of one-purpose forest.</p>
