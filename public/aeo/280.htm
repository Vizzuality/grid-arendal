<h4><i>Biodiversity</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, the dominant trend affecting terrestrial biodiversity 
  continues to be the fragmentation and loss of habitats, resulting from land 
  transformation. Not only does this reduce the populations of some species to 
  below sustainable levels, but the associated disruption of ecosystem integrity 
  and functioning alters the conditions necessary for the survival of others. 
  Similar changes occur in aquatic ecosystems although, here, the changes are 
  driven by impoundment, sedimentation, and prolonged isolation of water bodies. 
  Coastal and marine ecosystems, and their biota, are likewise threatened by loss 
  of habitat, pollution and overharvesting of biological resources. In all cases, 
  the trends are driven by the ongoing growth of the human population and its 
  increasing demands for land, water and natural resources.</p>
<p>Concern over the loss of biodiversity continues to stimulate both national 
  and international conservation efforts but, given the magnitude of the countervailing 
  forces, most of these prove to be inadequate. This is exacerbated by the widespread 
  undervaluation of biodiversity, and differing perceptions within society of 
  the economic, environmental and cultural values of biodiversity. Moreover, the 
  assigned values are not just those of people living in Africa but, at a global 
  level, are strongly influenced by outside interests, shaped by tourism and the 
  media. This produces both benefits and drawbacks. People and organizations from 
  outside Africa are willing to invest time and money promoting the conservation 
  of African wildlife, but they also seek to dictate policies on how components 
  of that diversity should be managed and used. For example, trade in wildlife 
  and wildlife products remains a hotly contested issue, even though it can be 
  argued that this would generate more resources for conservation.</p>

<p>Ecotourism continues to grow. Efforts to ensure that local communities benefit 
  financially and in other ways are expanded, but benefits, in many cases, are 
  relatively small. Nevertheless, the sense of empowerment and the prospect of 
  improved benefits at a later date encourage many communities to remain engaged 
  in the management and conservation of their natural resources. This concept 
  of community-based management of natural resources is gradually extended to 
  communities which rely on freshwater, coastal and inshore marine resources. 
  Species are introduced, both deliberately and inadvertently. The spread of alien 
  organisms increases pressure on indigenous species, and contributes to the gradual 
  loss of biodiversity. Extensive cash-crop monocultures reduce on-farm agrobiodiversity. 
  The resulting loss of natural predators, together with other disruptions to 
  ecosystem integrity, create conditions for widespread outbreaks of pests and 
  diseases.</p>
<p>Despite concerns in some quarters over the development and release of GMOs, 
  and the resulting risk of genetic pollution of indigenous species, these are 
  overridden by commercial pressures. The release of GMOs threatens agricultural 
  biodiversity in some areas, especially where farmers depend on maintaining a 
  mix of species and races as a hedge against annual and seasonal variations in 
  farming conditions. This is made worse by the eventual release of GMOs encoded 
  with a terminator gene, which ensures that the seed produced is non-viable, 
  thereby requiring farmers to purchase another batch of seed the following season, 
  instead of retaining some of the seed for planting next year. The strict protection 
  granted to GMO producers by Plant Breeders' Rights, along with the provisions 
  of patents on terminator technology, allow plant breeders to collect revenues 
  every year from the users.</p>
<p>The search for organisms with unique genetic and biochemical properties continues. 
  Again, the shortage of technical knowledge and skills within Africa means that 
  much of this bio-prospecting is carried out by scientists from overseas. Despite 
  attempts to regulate the acquisition and removal of biological material, and 
  to ensure adequate. Materials stored in gene banks overseas are largely inaccessible 
  to African countries, including those from which the material originated. The 
  benefits of conserving biodiversity are seen by many in Africa to be unfairly 
  shared, with royalties accruing to multinationals rather than to the countries 
  from which the material was derived. This becomes a source of tension and weakness. 
  Africa resolves to continue conserving biodiversity and to cooperate with overseas 
  organizations.</p>
