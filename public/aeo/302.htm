<h5>Forests</h5>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, deforestation and degradation of forest areas 
  continue at higher rates, except in some areas, where they might be recovered. 
  The élite, tempted by the high demand for forest products in the global market, 
  act as resource extractors, and overexploit the forest resources. Ironically, 
  they safeguard some forest areas under international pressure. Some of the remote 
  forest areas, away from population pressure, are also saved, such as parts of 
  the rainforests of the Congo Basin. Poor people fall back on extensive use of 
  the forest resources which they have access to, as a source of energy, food 
  and shelter. Commercial exploitation of medicinal plants contributes to accelerated 
  deforestation. Forest wood is also used commercially, for the production of 
  crafts for trade. The introduction of alien species and forest plantation play 
  a significant role in modifying the structural composition of forests.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>The increase in the poverty of peasant farmers, and the fall in prices of agricultural 
  produce, lead to more pressure on the forests, which are the primary sources 
  of revenue. 'Unbridled' logging is witnessed. The industries which are involved 
  in logging do not take the regulations into account and, thus, engage in illegal 
  logging activities. The export of logs limits the economic impact of logging 
  in the local and national economies. Non-wood forestry products experience a 
  boost in their development, with greater pressure brought to bear on them. This 
  is also true of medicinal plants and forestry products for domestic use. The 
  consequences of deforestation and desert encroachment are disastrous for the 
  Sahelian areas (Northern Cameroon and Central Africa, and Chad).</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the future of forests in Northern Africa is 
  largely determined by the way they are seen by the élite. Because forests in 
  this sub-region do not have much significant value as a source of raw material 
  for industry-apart from the production of gum arabic-the élite do not give them 
  much attention. Forests are left to be overexploited by the poor majority as 
  a cheap source of fuelwood, charcoal and wood for small shelters. Unfortunately, 
  the poor, who struggle to satisfy their basic needs before they start to worry 
  about the environment, do not see the environmental values of the forests.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Deforestation worsens, especially in places surrounding urban areas, due to 
  increased poverty. High population growth rates imply that demand for forest 
  resources, especially firewood, grows. Tree types that produce a lot of heat 
  and less smoke are selectively felled, resulting in changes in the structure 
  and composition of forests.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Forest and woodland areas are reduced by 75 per cent throughout the region, 
  as a result of warfare, subsistence farming and loss of other sources of energy, 
  and through neglect.</p>
