<h2>EASTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>The climate of Eastern Africa supports a variety of forest and woodland cover 
  from dense tropical forests, in the humid and mountainous regions of Uganda, 
  Burundi and Rwanda, to the dry savannas of the Horn of Africa. Approximately 
  13 per cent of the total land area of Eastern Africa is covered in forests and 
  woodlands, and this constitutes approximately 5 per cent of the total African 
  forest cover. However, the percentage of forest and woodland ranges from 30 
  per cent in Kenya (although just 2 per cent of this is closed canopy forest), 
  to less than 1 per cent in Djibouti (FAO 2001a, Wass 1995). There are also abundant 
  mangrove and coastal forests in Eastern Africa. The major issue in this sub-region 
  is conversion of natural forest to alternative land uses, predominantly cultivation 
  and grazing, although urban encroachment is also a contributing factor.</p>

<h3><a name="img2d2"></a>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUE OF FORESTS AND 
  WOODLANDS IN EASTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>The forests of the Eastern Arc mountain chain, running through Kenya and Tanzania, 
  and the Albertine Rift Montane Forests of the western border of Uganda are of 
  particular biological importance (Rodgers 1998, Mittermeier, Myers, Gil & Mittermeier 
  2000, MUIENR 2000). The Eastern Arc Mountains are the oldest mountains in the 
  sub-region and their climate, influenced by the Indian Ocean, has given rise 
  to areas of forest which have evolved largely in isolation, given their high 
  altitude and separation from one another. Isolation has resulted in large numbers 
  of animals and plants being endemic to these forests and they have been identified 
  as one of the 25 internationally recognized hotspots of biodiversity. They harbour 
  30-40 per cent of Tanzania's species (Iddi 1998, Mittermeier and others 2000). 
  The Eastern Arc Mountains also form the catchment for rivers supplying the hydropower 
  that represents 61.5 per cent of Tanzania's total electricity generation capacity 
  (Iddi 1998). </p>
<p>There are few estimates of the indirect value of forests in the sub-region. 
  From the few that exist, the water catchment protection value of the Mount Kenya 
  Forest is reported to be around US$55 million in terms of effects on production 
  and replacement cost (Emerton 1997). The Albertine Rift Montane Forests occupy 
  one of the most significant geological and biogeographic regions of Africa, 
  and support a wealth of largely endemic biodiversity. The forests on these mountains 
  play a vital role in intercepting precipitation and channelling run-off into 
  Africa's two largest hydrological networks (The Nile and Congo basins). The 
  forests are also important in terms of atmospheric exchanges and global and 
  regional climate regulation, as well as protecting and enhancing soil stability 
  and fertility (ARCOS 2000).</p>
<p>Although commercial timber exploitation is limited in Eastern African countries, 
  all forest and woodland areas are important in terms of the natural resources 
  they provide to local communities. In Kenya, it is estimated that some 2.9 million 
  people (more than onetenth of the population of the country) live within 5 km 
  of natural forests, (Emerton 1992). The value of forest resources to these communities 
  has been estimated at US$94 million per year, comprising fuelwood, grazing, 
  polewood and timber (Emerton 1993). Fuelwood and charcoal supply the majority 
  of the sub-region's energy, meeting 96 per cent of energy needs in Uganda and 
  75 per cent in Kenya (FAO 2001a).</p>

<p>Non-wood forest products are also used extensively in the sub-region. In Uganda, 
  for example the combined value of medicines, bamboo shoots, wild foods, shea 
  butter, oil, honey, gum arabic, curios, and weaving materials has been estimated 
  at about US$40 million per year (Emerton and Muramira 1999). The potential of 
  medicinal plants in Eastern Africa is widely acknowledged and they are used 
  by Maasai, Kipsigis, Turkana, and other tribes. The Maasai have a wellestablished 
  pharmacopoeia for treating livestock diseases. The use of more than 60 species 
  or subspecies of plants for ethnoveterinary purposes has been documented among 
  the Olkonerei Maasai. These plants have been shown to act on a wide range of 
  pathogens as well as regulating fertility, inflammation, and digestive disorders 
  in livestock (Ole Lengisugi & Mziray 1996). Several of these species are now 
  being documented and researched for potential commercial application, including 
  the introduced tree species, <i>Azadirachta indica </i>which is being researched 
  for anti-malarial properties by the Kenya Medical Research Institute's Traditional 
  Medicine and Drugs Research Centre, Nairobi. In Uganda, the National Chemotherapeutics 
  Research Laboratory, in Kampala, is conducting research on many indigenous plant 
  species (Cunningham 1997).</p>
<p>Weaving using wood products and wood carving are important traditional crafts 
  that contribute substantially to household incomes and local economies in Eastern 
  Africa. It has been estimated that there are 60 000 woodcarvers in Kenya alone, 
  with each carver generating an additional five jobs in harvesting of the wood, 
  and sanding and polishing of the finished carvings. The annual value of exported 
  carvings has mushroomed from around US$60 000 in the 1950s to US$20 million 
  today (Cunningham 2001).<br clear="all"></p>
