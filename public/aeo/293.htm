<h4><i>Freshwater</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, although an increasing population exerts pressure, 
  particularly on water and land resources, the introduction of integrated water 
  resources management ensures that the needs of the people are adequately met, 
  even though the resources available are much reduced compared to the beginning 
  of this century.</p>
<p>Water distribution networks are upgraded in order to minimize water losses. 
  Appropriate technology enables local authorities and the private sector to monitor 
  water distribution 24 hours day, ensuring that burst pipes are repaired as soon 
  as leakages occur. The technology also helps to reduce water piracy along distribution 
  lines. A complete mapping of urban groundwater supplies, using the latest technology 
  in geographic information systems, enables authorities to monitor excessive 
  abstraction of water and to enforce punitive tariffs.</p>
<p>Irrigation equipment is improved in order to reduce water losses due to seepage 
  and evaporation. The revolutionary technology enables Africa to intensify agricultural 
  production throughout the year. Dependency on rainfed agriculture, particularly 
  commercial farming, is reduced, lowering food insecurity at different levels, 
  including at the family level.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>The optimal management of financial resources helps to ensure the provision 
  of potable water in cities and rural areas, through specific programmes. For 
  the Sahelian areas, the problem of desertification continues, but the development 
  of water management policies and 'Green Sahel' programmes helps to ensure the 
  replanting of wood in arid areas. The practice of irrigated agriculture develops, 
  and ensures an export-oriented agricultural production, which earns foreign 
  currency.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>Government policies to promote industrial development and to increase access 
  to safe drinking water to majority of the population make freshwater a focal 
  issue in government strategies. The private sector becomes a key player in the 
  water sector, as realistic values are attached to freshwater. As its value increases, 
  appropriate measures are undertaken to protect and tap this valuable resource. 
  Ambitious projects are initiated to take water to deficit areas where the demand 
  and price are attractive, for example, the lowlands of Ethiopia or urban centres 
  such as Nairobi, which suffer from periodic shortages. Appropriate water pricing 
  reduces wastage and promotes the conservative use of water in the sub-region. 
  Social development programmes are designed and implemented by governments, focusing 
  on the supply of freshwater to the poorer segment of the population.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, water resources remain the main focus of governments, 
  because of their extreme importance to development. Many countries still suffer 
  from water scarcity in 2032, due to limited renewable resources and an arid 
  climate, in spite of the reductions in the rate of population growth. Water 
  master plans are drawn, and integrated water resources management frameworks 
  are formulated and implemented, under appropriate institutional frameworks.</p>
<p>Egypt and the Sudan seek to increase their supplies of water from the River 
  Nile by integrating their development projects and becoming closely involved 
  with the rest of the riparian countries when formulating their water policies. 
  Egypt and Tunisia adopt groundwater-recharging schemes while, in Morocco, a 
  drought management plan is drawn up. New laws are passed through the legislative 
  system, which sets strong penalties for quantitative and qualitative water misuse. 
  Extensive public campaigns are launched to educate the people about the water 
  resources problem.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Proper accounting and economic valuation of water results in its efficient 
  usage. The effects of water scarcity are less prominent as consumers, especially 
  large ones such as irrigation agriculture, can no longer afford to be wasteful 
  of the resource, which is charged in economic terms.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>Every country in Western Africa gets a degree of rainfall. It ranges from as 
  little as 0.1 millimetres in some parts of Mauritania, Mali and Niger to an 
  annual average of more than 4000 millimetres in some parts of Liberia, Sierra 
  Leone and Guinea. The heavy rainfall in most of the sixteen Western African 
  countries closest to the coast assures these countries many bodies of water. 
  In the Policy reform scenario, management of these bodies of water is transformed, 
  thereby guaranteeing supplies of freshwater all year round. The countries that 
  are less endowed within the context of the successful economic integration policies 
  of ECOWAS also derive benefits.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>In the Policy reform scenario, some profound damage to aquifers proves irreversible 
  in the medium term. Continual problems arise as a result of the heavy use of 
  water for irrigation by agriculture and by tourism, which is reluctant to opt 
  for recycled water and is able to pay higher tariffs for metered use.</p>
