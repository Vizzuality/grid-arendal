<h2>WESTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Western Africa faces challenges arising from climate variability-especially 
  in the arid Sahelian zone where drought is recurrent-and from the predicted 
  impacts of climate change on food production, freshwater availability, and desertification. 
  Localized problems of air quality have also been identified as priorities for 
  action.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>

<p><a name="img2a9"></a>The climate of the Western Africa sub-region varies greatly 
  from north to south and is mainly governed by the seasonal movements of the 
  ITCZ. Desert and semidesert regimes, characterized by annual precipitation of 
  100-300 mm, prevail along the border of the Sahel covering Mauritania, northern 
  Senegal, Mali, and Niger. There is substantial inter-annual variability in precipitation 
  with no perennial run-off and flash floods occurring in small basins during 
  rainy periods. In addition, evaporation rates are very high (more than 4 m/year). 
  Further south, temperatures and evaporation rates are lower, although widespread 
  flooding occurs because of the marked hydrological degradation, relatively high 
  run-off and large areas of flat land. The coastal zone experiences warmer, wetter 
  conditions, with annual rainfall in excess of 1 000 mm/yr, and greater reliability 
  of rainfall, although floods are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Drought is a recurrent problem in the Sahelian zone of Western Africa, although 
  the equatorial zone is rarely affected. The last Sahelian drought, one of the 
  worst on record, persisted for a whole decade from 1972-84, and reduced precipitation 
  was even noted in the equatorial zone. During this period, more than 100 000 
  people died, and more than 750 000 people in Mali, Niger and Mauritania were 
  totally dependent on food aid in 1974 (Wijkman & Timberlake 1984). The drought 
  also resulted in power shortages in Benin, Chad, Mali, and Nigeria because of 
  hydropower failures at the Kainji Dam on the River Niger (IPCC 1998). Desertification 
  is also a problem in the region, especially in the arid and semi-arid zones, 
  but it also affects the sub-humid zones. For example, as in Central Africa, 
  the falling level of Lake Chad could have major economic implications for the 
  millions of people in Western Africa who depend on its resources.</p>
<h4>Strategies for coping with climate variability in Western Africa</h4>
<p>All the countries of Western Africa have ratified the UNCCD. Benin, Burkina 
  Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Mali, Niger, and Senegal have produced National Action 
  Plans, and The Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS), together 
  with the CILSS, has produced a Sub-regional Action Plan (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>Other recent projects in the sub-region include an assessment of the vulnerability 
  of production systems in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal. A Sahel Sahara 
  Observatory has been set up, within the framework of the UNCCD, to act as a 
  sub-regional coordinating body and to provide improved access to and sharing 
  of information, and to implement scientific and technical capacitybuilding projects 
  in land and water resource management. Areas of specific interest for this project 
  include development of data banks, preparation of manuals and handbooks, facilitating 
  of north-south exchanges of experience and knowledge, and provision for the 
  transfer of know-how between the various areas of Africa.</p>
