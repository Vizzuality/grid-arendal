<h3><a name="fig2c5"></a>HARVESTING OF COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES IN SOUTHERN 
  AFRICA </h3>
<p>Most of Southern Africa's coastal and marine resources are under pressure from 
  unsustainable rates and methods of harvesting, resulting from increasing demand 
  on marine resources for food (driven by population increase, rising demand by 
  wealthy consumers, export markets, and tourists). Demand comes not only from 
  the maritime countries but also from inland nations. FAO trends for marine harvest, 
  indicate a decline in marine stocks since 1972 for most countries in the sub-region 
  (FAOSTAT 2001). This is illustrated by <a href="#fig2c5">Figure 2c.5</a>.</p>
<p>Mangrove forests are also subjected to unsustainable harvesting pressures and 
  are being cleared for agricultural uses, salt production and human settlements. 
  The rate of deforestation in Mozambique has been over 3 per cent per year in 
  the last 18 years (Saket and Matusse 1994). Lack of monitoring and research 
  as well as inadequate policy enforcement also contribute to overharvesting of 
  mangrove resources by both domestic and commercial users. The slow regeneration 
  rates of mangrove trees and mining of coastal sands are exacerbating the rate 
  of loss of mangrove habitats and are accelerating erosion rates in the coastal 
  zone. Loss of mangrove habitat also impacts on productivity of artisanal and 
  commercial shrimp and crab fisheries. Elevated sediment loads in coastal waters 
  (due to erosion in the coastal zone and upstream) can increase turbidity and 
  cause siltation of estuaries. In the open ocean, sediments can be deposited, 
  smothering fragile habitats such as coral reefs, and benthic habitats in sheltered 
  bays. This not only has impacts on the ecosystems but may also affect the potential 
  revenues from tourism.</p>
<h4>Sustainable harvesting of coastal and marine resources in Southern Africa 
</h4>
<p>Reduced catches and a decrease in the mean sizes of fish caught have led to 
  calls for the protection of line fish stocks by many governments in the sub-region, 
  although controls have not always been easy to monitor and enforce. Fisheries 
  management measures include minimum size limits, bag limits, closed seasons, 
  and closed areas (marine reserves). For example, under the Marine Living Resources 
  Act of South Africa (1998), all South African fish stocks must be used on a 
  sustainable basis and overexploited populations must be allowed to recover to 
  sustainable levels before harvesting is resumed. In December 2000, drastically 
  reduced stocks of line fish prompted South Africa's Minister of Environmental 
  Affairs & Tourism to declare a State of Emergency, suspending the activities 
  of commercial, artisanal and recreational anglers until stocks regenerate (DEA&T 
  2000a).</p>

<p><a name="img2c7"></a>Public awareness, policy directives and technological 
  development are essential for ecosystem management and some countries have made 
  progress in this regard. Other proposals for the management of coastal and marine 
  resources include formulation of marine resource management plans, community-based 
  management of mangroves and fishery resources, and institutional capacity building 
  (Sousa 1998).</p>
<p>MPAs have been established in Southern Africa to limit harvesting of coastal 
  and marine resources. There are 44 MPAs along the sub-region's coast, mostly 
  under the jurisdiction of central or provincial governments (WCMC 1999). Where 
  MPAs have been formally established and regulated, as in some parts of South 
  Africa, inshore fisheries have successfully recovered (Msiska, Jiddaw & Sumaila 
  2000). In other areas, however, lack of education and of enforcement of regulations 
  has hindered the success of MPAs in regulating extraction rates of some species. 
  For example, more than 17 tonnes of Abalone (a species covered by Appendix III 
  of the CITES) were confiscated from poachers along the coast of Cape Town during 
  December 2001 and January 2002 (Craig Haskins, City of Cape Town, personal communication).</p>
<p>By contrast, informal protection has been successful in other areas. In Namibia, 
  for instance, fishing within 200 m of the coast is illegal although there is 
  no formal protection, and fisheries resources within this zone have been successfully 
  protected (Msiska and others 2000). In some countries, partnerships are being 
  formed to protect marine and coastal resources, as governments recognize the 
  need to balance subsistence and small-scale activities with commercial demand 
  and export revenues. This can be expected to substantially improve not only 
  the management of resources but also relations between fishermen and authorities 
  because subsistence fishermen will come to regard themselves as stakeholders 
  and managers of common resources and not simply as acting under instruction 
  from the government.<br clear="all">
