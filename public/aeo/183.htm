<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN EASTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Population and climatic pressures have taken their toll on land and resources 
  in Eastern Africa, and the subregion is experiencing some of the most rapid 
  degradation rates in Africa (Henao and Baanante 1999). It has been estimated 
  that 2 million ha of Ethiopia's highlands have been degraded beyond rehabilitation, 
  and an additional 14 million ha severely degraded (EPA/MEDC 1997). The same 
  study estimated that more than 25 per cent of the country is experiencing desertification, 
  and the annual rate of topsoil loss is reported to be 1 900 million tonnes (EPA/MEDC 
  1997). As farms have been sub-divided over the years, decreasing farm size has 
  led to shorter fallow periods and, in some places, to continuous cropping, in 
  order to sustain productivity levels. Crop residues are rarely ploughed into 
  the soil, and applications of other organic matter have been low, resulting 
  in higher requirements for inorganic fertilizers, with consequent problems of 
  salinization and pollution (FAO 2001c). In the early 1990s, Rwanda and Burundi 
  experienced nutrient depletion rates of more than 100 kg ha/yr of nitrogen, 
  phosphorous and potassium (NPK) (Henao and Baanante 1999). Almost 80 per cent 
  of Kenya's total land area is classified as arid or semi-arid and, in these 
  areas, removal of vegetation cover (through overgrazing and for charcoal production) 
  exposes the soil to wind and water erosion. Soil compaction occurs in areas 
  where there is excessive trampling by animals and, in cultivated areas, soil 
  fertility is declining, as a result of the exhaustion of soils by mono-specific 
  cropping and reduction of fallow periods (FAO/AGL 2000). Colonial land policies 
  have also contributed to degradation through the marginalization of pastoralists, 
  as shown by the example in <a href="#box2f3">Box 2f.3</a>. In irrigated areas 
  of Kenya, approximately 50 per cent of the soils are affected by salt, as a 
  result of the poor management of irrigation (FAO/AGL 2000). In Uganda, the estimated 
  proportion of degraded land ranges from 20 per cent to 90 per cent, with soil 
  degradation, resulting from overgrazing and soil compaction, a common feature 
  in the major cattle-rearing areas (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>

            <p>Quality of grazing lands refers not only to the quantity of vegetation 
              cover, but also to the quality of the grazing available, as well 
              as other factors, such as water availability, mineral content and 
              parasite load. A good illustration of this is provided by the interactions 
              of Maasai cattle with wildlife in the pastoral areas of Kenya. It 
              has been suggested that, when the Maasai were excluded from their 
              traditional grazing areas under British colonial administration, 
              wildebeest moved in to graze these high-quality short grass plains 
              and, consequently, their numbers increased. Exclusion of the Maasai 
              means that their cattle are now restricted to lower quality areas, 
              which the herdsmen would traditionally have avoided due to their 
              high parasite load.</p>

<p>In Djibouti, where 85 per cent of the land area is dryland or desert, the remaining 
  15 per cent of the land has been classified as moderately, severely or extremely 
  vulnerable to desertification. In Eritrea, 42 per cent of the area not already 
  classified as desert is vulnerable. In Ethiopia, this is 26 per cent and, in 
  Kenya, it is 35 per cent (Reich and others 2001). Soil fertility has also declined 
  under cultivation with little organic inputs and short fallow periods. Other 
  causes of land degradation are: inappropriate crop production practices; overgrazing; 
  land fragmentation; deforestation; uncontrolled bushfires; and inefficient mineral 
  exploration techniques. According to Slade and Weitz (1991), the annual cost 
  of soil erosion in Uganda is in the order of US$132-396 million. Soil loss estimates 
  in Ethiopia range from US$15 million (FAO 1986) to US$155 million (Sutcliffe 
  1993), equivalent to between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of GDP. Cumulative economic 
  losses, as a result of lowered productivity, could reach US$3 000 million for 
  Ethiopia (Bojo 1996).</p>
<p>The impacts of soil degradation include: increased risk of flooding; sedimentation 
  in rivers, lakes and dams; smothering of coastal habitats; and eutrophication. 
  For example, in Uganda, uncontrolled flooding was experienced in 1997-98, as 
  a result of the El Niño rains, and because of extensive vegetation removal, 
  landslides were experienced (NEMA 1999). In April 1999, thousands of fish deaths 
  were observed in the Albert Nile River, most likely caused by eutrophication, 
  resulting from soil erosion and increased levels of fertilizers in the river. 
  Soil degradation also contributes to rising rural poverty and food insecurity, 
  because productivity is reduced, and subsistence farmers are less and less able 
  to accumulate reserves of grain. Ultimately, rural-to-urban migration and encroachment 
  into gazetted natural reserves occur, as are now extensively experienced in 
  Uganda (NEMA 1999).</p>
