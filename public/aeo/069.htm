<p><a name="img2b5"></a>Northern Africa's extreme climatic conditions and physical 
  features greatly influence the sub-region's biological elements. Most of Northern 
  Africa falls within arid and semi-arid environments, but there is also a range 
  of geomorphological features and sub-climatic zones which have created diverse 
  ecosystems and extremely rich communities of flora and fauna. For example, long 
  shores with vast areas of coastal land, oases in the Sahara and varying landforms 
  create diversity of habitat and remarkable biological diversity, including a 
  large number of varieties and strains of field crops. Morocco, for example, 
  has 3 675 recorded species of higher plants, and Sudan has 267 recorded species 
  of mammals and 938 recorded species of birds. The sub-region's reptiles and 
  amphibians are still under assessment in most countries, but Egypt has already 
  recorded 83 species of reptile and 6 species of amphibians. The sub-region has 
  1 129 endemic species, 22 endemic species of mammals, one endemic bird species, 
  20 endemic species of reptiles and 4 endemic species of amphibians, with Morocco 
  having the greatest level of endemism (WCMC 1992). Northern Africa also encompasses 
  the biota of the semi-closed Mediterranean and Red Seas. The Mediterranean Basin 
  is one of the 25 internationally recognized biodiversity hotspots, with extraordinary 
  plant diversity and endemism.</p>
<p>There are also five regionally recognized hotspots in Northern Africa, these 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Imatong Mountains and surrounding lowlands on the border between Sudan 
    and Uganda. This area has nearly half of the total flora of Sudan and 12 endemic 
    species of plants.</li>
  <li>The isolated Jebel Marra volcanic massifs near the Sudan border with Chad, 
    with about 950 plant species.</li>
  <li>Jebel Elba, a mountainous ecosystem bordering the Red Sea between Egypt 
    and Sudan. This is a transitional area between Afrotropical and palaearctic 
    biogeographic realms and has an estimated three to four times as many plant 
    species as desert areas further north.</li>
  <li>Tassili d`Ajjer, a highland area in Algeria, where several plant species 
    are recorded as near endemic and one is strictly endemic.</li>
  <li>The High Atlas Mountains which extend along the northern part of Morocco 
    and into Tunisia, home to more than one-third of all endemic species in Northern 
    Africa.</li>
</ul>
