<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN WESTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Land degradation is identified as a major issue in many western African countries, 
  specifically with regard to: the degradation of forest cover; intensive cultivation 
  practices; and natural disasters, such as droughts and desertification. The 
  current state is a reflection of increasing pressures on land resources over 
  the past 30 years, due to: population growth; rising demand for production and 
  energy; and worsening poverty. Policies in support of foreign exchange earnings 
  are additional pressures, which have intensified land degradation in both the 
  dry savanna and the wet forest zones of the sub-region.</p>
<p>Loss of soil fertility and soil erosion are the obvious manifestations of land 
  degradation in western Africa. In the northern Sahelian zone, where animal husbandry 
  is the dominant agricultural practice, the main agent of soil erosion is the 
  wind, which is supported by dry climatic conditions. Overgrazing and trampling 
  reduces the vegetative cover and causes compacting of the soil, which is then 
  vulnerable to erosion. In the wet forest zones of the sub-region, sheet and 
  gully erosions are predominant, due to loss of vegetative cover. In commercial 
  plantations and subsistence farms alike, soil fertility is declining, as a result 
  of the prohibitive costs of inorganic fertilizers. In Ghana, for example, water 
  erosion is the major problem, with more than 220 000 km<sup>2</sup> of land affected by 
  sheet and gully erosion, of which 50 000 km<sup>2</sup> is severely affected (FAO/AGL 2000). 
  Nutrient depletion is widespread in Ghana, especially in the coastal areas, 
  due to high losses of organic matter caused by: reduction of fallow; intensive 
  cropping; and inadequate applications of fertilizers (FAO/AGL 2000). The long 
  term on-site consequence of erosion and nutrient depletion is the reduction 
  in crop yield, and annual productivity losses of 2.9 per cent in all crops and 
  livestock have been recorded in Ghana (FAO/AGL 2000). The impacts of this on 
  Ghana's economy have been estimated at 2-5 per cent of agricultural GDP. Furthermore, 
  additional losses and costs may be incurred, for example, through eutrophication 
  of water bodies, resulting from sedimentation and accumulation of fertilizer 
  residues. Soil degradation also has consequences at the household level, affecting 
  incomes and food intake, as well as encouraging rural-to-urban migration.</p>
<p>In the Sahelian belt of western Africa, there is an increasing risk of erosion 
  and desertification (FAO 2000b, Reich and others 2001). In Niger, for example, 
  only 19 per cent of the country is non-desert, and most of this is highly or 
  very highly vulnerable to desertification (Reich and others 2001). Mauritania 
  is similarly affected, with 93 per cent of the country classified as hyper-arid, 
  and the remaining 7 per cent at moderate to very high risk of desertification 
  (Reich and others 2001). The IPCC predicts that rainfall and run-off will decline, 
  and that evaporation will increase, in this zone, further contributing to desertification 
  pressures in future (IPCC 2001).</p>
<h4>Improving land quality and productivity in Western Africa</h4>
<p>All the countries of western Africa have ratified the UNCCD, and Benin, Burkina 
  Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Mali, Niger and Senegal have produced National Action 
  Plans. The Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) and the CILSS 
  have jointly produced a Sub-regional Action Plan (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>Following an upsurge of general environmental awareness as a result of the 
  Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, many countries in western 
  Africa have formulated environmental and land use policies aimed at stopping 
  land degradation. NEAPs, National Conservation Strategies (NCSs) and other such 
  strategy frameworks have been adopted to address these land issues. In most 
  instances, these policy responses have been initiated or sponsored by external 
  agencies and institutions, which provided the bulk of the funding. National 
  and sub-regional institutions have also been created to address specific issues, 
  including: the development of drought-resistant crop varieties; collation of 
  reliable climatic data; and soil conservation measures. Population policies 
  have also been adopted in most of the countries, and relevant institutions are 
  in place to implement these policies and related programmes. However, family 
  planning programmes adopted in countries in the subregion since the 1970s have 
  not reduced the population growth rate, which still averages 3 per cent (ECOWAS 
  2000).</p>
<p>Local programmes to improve land management include: stone bunding, in order 
  to control erosion on slopes in the northern savanna region; and applying organic 
  matter to cultivated areas, in order to replace nutrients. Composting, agroforestry 
  and the establishment of woodlots are additional land and water conservation 
  measures in operation in Ghana (FAO/AGL 2000). In Niger, the Keita Integrated 
  Development Project was launched in 1984, in order to address declines in agricultural 
  production caused by drought, desertification and population growth. Women have 
  been the main participants in the project, and have been involved in: dune stabilization; 
  land reclamation; soil and water conservation; reforestation; crop production; 
  rural engineering; training; and setting up credit and alternative incomes (Carucci 
  2000).</p>
