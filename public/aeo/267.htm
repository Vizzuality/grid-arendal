<h4>Economics</h4>
<p>In relation to its size, population and relative abundance of natural resources, 
  Africa is grossly underdeveloped, contributing, in 1999, only 1.1 per cent of 
  global total GDP (WB 2000). Furthermore, the economies of most African countries 
  show a marked dualism, with a relatively small commercial sector, based mostly 
  on the extraction and export of natural resources (minerals, agriculture, other 
  natural products and tourism), and a relatively large subsistence and informal 
  economic sector. This dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources 
  makes the economies of these countries particularly vulnerable to global economic 
  fluctuations, especially in mineral and commodity prices.. The level of industrialization 
  is low, and relatively little value is added within the region in the case of 
  minerals and agricultural commodities. This means that industrial emissions 
  of greenhouse gases is low, both overall and per capita, and emissions per unit 
  of industrial and manufactured output are relatively high, because of the relatively 
  old and inefficient equipment and technologies used by industry in Africa.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, over the past four decades, the economies of African countries 
  have undergone considerable change, as they have moved from a colonial phase 
  economy to a post-colonial economy. For instance, the development of modern, 
  commercialized colonial agriculture was geared to the growth of cash crops for 
  export. Although agriculture has remained a major economic sector, there have 
  been key transformations, especially in the industrial sector, which has grown 
  rapidly and on a large scale in some countries, to include heavy industries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the economic underdevelopment of African countries reflects, 
  in part, their history of economic and political colonization and, partly, the 
  economic and other policies adopted by governments following independence. These 
  include: wage and price controls; widespread subsidies of basic commodities; 
  a burgeoning civil service; fixed currency exchange rates, which lead to overvaluation 
  of currencies; high tax rates; and disincentives for potential external investors. 
  Many countries have had to accept economic Structural Adjustment Programmes 
  (SAPs), often as a condition for being granted loans by the WB and the International 
  Monetary Fund (IMF). The features of these programmes vary somewhat from country 
  to country, but common elements include: strict controls on public expenditure; 
  reforms of the structure and functioning of the civil service; reductions in 
  barriers to trade; the removal of domestic subsidies; opening up of the economy 
  to external investment; and allowing the value of the national currency to be 
  determined by market forces. Nevertheless, these changes are proving to be socially 
  disruptive and difficult to implement, with rising unemployment, sharply rising 
  prices of even basic commodities and increasing inequity, among others.</p>
<p>For a long time, the promised benefits of SAPs have not been realized. Instead, 
  these countries have drifted further away from development and their debt burdens 
  have increased yearly (Vavi, 199). Debt has been a stumbling block for many 
  African nations, which have had to spend more on serving their debt than on 
  providing basic social services. A combination of internal and external factors 
  has precipitated Africa's debt problem. Africa's total debt stock stood at US$320 
  000 million in 1998, having increased by about 13 per cent from 1990.</p>

<p>Africa's share in the world trade is small and declining, and is being met 
  with fierce competition from the other regions of the world that have faster 
  and more sustained economic growth. Nevertheless, exports and imports have significant 
  influence on the region's economy, with exports alone accounting for 25 per 
  cent of the regional GDP, and imports providing 20 per cent of the domestic 
  supply (ECA 1997). Africa has become severally marginalized in the global economy 
  as it continues to face formidable barriers to northern markets. Most of the 
  wealth generated by trade liberalization has flowed to developed countries. 
  The rules governing world trade-set largely by the industrialized countries 
  over the course of the 1986-94 Uruguay Round of agreements-have only contributed 
  to Africa's economic woes.</p>
<p>Poverty remains endemic in Africa. In the late 1990s, more than 46 per cent 
  of, or 290 million, people in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than US$ 1 per 
  day, up from 217 million people a decade earlier. Much of the poverty is based 
  in rural areas and is, therefore, difficult to address, because of relative 
  inaccessibility of much of the population and the limited economic opportunities 
  for rapid development. This continuing poverty and associated vulnerability 
  to all sorts of shocks, together with the inability of the relatively weak African 
  economies to create conditions that would help to reduce poverty, has meant 
  that countries in the region remain dependent on external aid.</p>
