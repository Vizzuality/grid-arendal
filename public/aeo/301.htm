<h5>Biodiversity</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, biodiversity and its ecosystems come under 
  severe pressure, with natural ecosystems reduced to small pockets of protected 
  areas with limited access, mainly to the élite. National and international conservation 
  and protection efforts decline, as a result of: lack of biodiversity conservation 
  frameworks; strategic and financial resources; and unfair activities which cause 
  significant habitat destruction, resulting in a greater number of extinctions 
  and species under threat. Furthermore, as ethics and cultural values degrade, 
  trade regulatory mechanisms completely break down, legitimizing trade in endangered 
  species. Loss of biodiversity and invasion by alien/exotic species are increasingly 
  widespread, causing increased outbreaks of pests and disease, resulting from 
  a lack of natural predators and ecosystem destabilization.</p>
<p>Unfair sharing of the benefits of biodiversity continues, with royalties accruing 
  to multinationals rather than African source countries. Gene banks are mostly 
  located in the west, and are inaccessible to poor African countries, which are 
  among the main source of the gene materials. The long undervalued biodiversity 
  becomes valued, but is overshadowed by inequity and market forces. Biodiversity 
  comes under use in ecotourism, which is controlled and managed by the élite, 
  who also reap much of the benefits.</p>
<p>Patenting of GMOs continues to discriminate against African countries, and 
  to threaten agricultural biodiversity, especially of wild species. For example, 
  there is narrowing of gene biodiversity through the introduction of terminator 
  genes, and genetic pollution of indigenous species. In addition, Africa faces 
  new weed and pest problems, arising from GMOs.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>Lack of technological development does not allow for developing and enhancing 
  local knowledge, especially as far as medicinal plants are concerned. Natural 
  resources continue to be exploited by the laboratories from the north, who develop 
  research projects in this sub-region. The risk of specific species disappearing 
  is on the increase. The practice of (traditional, commercial and sporting) hunting 
  and fishing increases the pressure on the species which, in turn, are subject 
  to disappearance, in spite of conservation programmes. The development of ecotourism 
  is spearheaded by private companies, which do not bring about notable impacts 
  on local economies.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>Critical ecosystems and forests are more strictly protected, and the governments 
  in this sub-region strengthen the policing functions of the relevant agencies. 
  However, as the Fortress World scenario persists, the cost of protecting large 
  numbers of sites increases, and the focus shifts to prime sites-including national 
  parks, such as Bwindi, Mgahinga, Tsavo, Masa, Maara and Budongo, and so on-which 
  have a high potential of attracting income from tourism. Areas with very high 
  protection costs-such as Lake Mburu in Uganda, and Lakes Nakuru and Naivasha 
  in Kenya, and so on-are degazetted.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>The impact of the Fortress World scenario on biodiversity is similar to the 
  impact on coastal and marine areas. The élite minority put some areas under 
  their control, where industrial, recreational and tourism developments take 
  place. Only in those developments where biodiversity has a significant value 
  is it well protected. In industrial developments, preserving the natural environment 
  is very low on the list of priorities. On the other hand, the rapid urbanization 
  of the poor minority causes serious damage to biodiversity. Some people seek 
  to make a quick profit by illegally selling rare species, either to the élite 
  or abroad.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Due to lack of knowledge of the whole range of their biological resources, 
  most Southern African countries continue to have important genetic resources 
  pirated from the region. At the same time, high costs for medical treatment 
  and increasing rates of AIDS infection turn many to traditional medicine, and 
  this results in the overharvesting of certain species.</p>
<p> <i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the élite are consumed by the insatiable desire 
  for making money. They realize that, by protecting the fauna and flora, they 
  attract ecotourists, and earn huge profits on investment in the tourist industry. 
  Therefore, there are numerous sites which promote biodiversity, although such 
  sites are always almost linked to some investment in tourism. Traditional forms 
  of promoting biodiversity are undermined as people are displaced. Survival becomes 
  the paramount concern for the displaced who, quite often, prey on rare species, 
  either by selling to visitors or by using some as food, where applicable. The 
  landed class in the fortress world realizes that huge commercial farming affects 
  forest resources and, therefore, engages in some reforestation. They feel the 
  effect of climate change, which also has an impact on agricultural output. Efforts 
  to diversify into the construction industry are hindered by low forest resources 
  and increased demand for wood, and the élites push seriously for conservation 
  of the remaining forests.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Biodiversity declines steeply during this period, with serious loss of marine 
  and bird life, and with no large mammal survivals, apart from humans. Invasions 
  of vultures and other birds of prey are reported in Madagascar, and sightings 
  made in the Comoros. </p>
