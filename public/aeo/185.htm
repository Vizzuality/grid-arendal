<h3>LAND RIGHTS IN EASTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Land tenure in eastern Africa is a sensitive and complex issue. At independence, 
  the countries in the sub-region established quite different tenure reforms, 
  all aimed at improving productivity. For example, in Ethiopia, all land became 
  public land, with leasing or sale of land being forbidden (FAO 2001c) whereas, 
  in Kenya, the government pursued private ownership (Bruce, Subramanian, Knox, 
  Bohrer and Leisz 1997). In both Kenya and Ethiopia, fragmentation of land parcels 
  through subdivision has reduced the average farm size to less than 1 ha in many 
  areas. This has the result that fallow periods have been reduced or are omitted 
  altogether, in order to produce sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the 
  family. In spite of these policies, the countries of the sub-region have all 
  suffered impediments to large-scale agricultural development, and the majority 
  of the population are small-scale farmers (Bruce and others 1997).</p>
<p>The nomadic herdsmen of the Horn of Africa have suffered extreme marginalization 
  and reduced food security since the colonial governments seized control of all 
  central rangelands and, later, reallocated them for mechanized farming, expansion 
  of irrigated agriculture and declaration of wildlife reserves (see <a href="#box2f4">Box 
  2f.4</a>). Thus, the herdsmen have greatly reduced access to fodder, and are 
  frequently also denied access to crop residues in farming areas, except in return 
  for a fee. Cropping has extended steadily, woodcutting in former pasture areas 
  has been sanctioned, nomadic routes have been disturbed and watersources have 
  not been maintained (DFID 1999). The lack of institutional support for nomadic 
  pastoralists has further excluded their participation in decision making or 
  land use planning (DFID 1999).</p>

            <p>Many of Kenya's major wildlife reserves are in traditional pastoral 
              areas (for example,Maasailand and Samburu). The livestock belonging 
              to the indigenous pastoralists (the Maasai and Samburu tribes) are 
              excluded from the parks, because conservation areas were established 
              under colonial rule, and the prevailing philosophy was to preserve 
              and to protect the land from human activities. However, this results 
              in restrictions on important grazing areas (including springs and 
              other water sources) and disrupts traditional management practices. 
              At the same time, the parks are not fenced and the wild animals 
              are not herded. Therefore, they are able to leave the reserves at 
              certain times of the year and to graze in the same areas as livestock. 
              This means that the areas outside of the reserves incur additional 
              pressure - from the livestock that can no longer migrate into the 
              neighbouring reserves, and from the game that migrates out of the 
              reserve. The impact of the wildlife is also greater than that of 
              the cattle, as they have 'extended grazing hours', feeding throughout 
              the night, whereas cattle are kept in enclosures</p>

<p>Governments are recognizing that central control of land and agricultural resources 
  is limited by capacities and resources, and that land policy reform is needed 
  to encourage the formation of farms of viable size, for sustainability and growth 
  of agricultural output (FAO 2001c). In addition, just as state ownership has 
  not yielded the anticipated growth in agricultural production, private ownership 
  has also shown little benefit to increasing production, largely as a result 
  of market failures. Therefore, market reform must go hand in hand with tenure 
  reform (Bruce and others 1997). Policy-makers are also reforming attitudes towards 
  communal land tenure and access, and realizing that, under certain conditions, 
  communal systems provide security of tenure, environmental and production sustainability, 
  and conflict avoidance (Bruce and others 1997). However, this transformation 
  has been slow, and is still experiencing opposition in some countries. In Kenya, 
  for example, individual titling is still regarded as the political and social 
  ideal and, therefore, claims to communally owned land are often thrown out of 
  court. This has led to land grabbing, or illegal occupancy in some areas, notably 
  in urban areas and state forests (DFID 1999). Means for strengthening the voice 
  of community groups include the decentralization of political power and the 
  formation of natural resource use councils, comprised of community members (DFID 
  1999). In Uganda, the new Land Act (1998) combines objectives of agricultural 
  productivity and equity by promoting democratization and good governance with 
  some redistribution of land rights. Implementation of the Land Act (1998) has 
  been hindered by lack of an overall land policy, and by insufficient strategic 
  planning, limited resources and capacity, and widespread corruption (DFID 1999).</p>
<p>A further consideration in land reform is the issue of gender. Although women 
  are responsible for most household and commercial agricultural production (FAO 
  2001b), their rights to own land are severely diminished, being largely through 
  husbands or fathers (Bruce and others 1997). Governments' recognition of women's 
  rights, and the issue of gender reform, have not progressed as far in eastern 
  Africa as in southern Africa, although Burundi, Eritrea and Ethiopia are starting 
  to encourage the inheritance of land by women, and the allocation of land to 
  couples to create household holdings (Bruce and others 1997). </p>
