<h3>AIR QUALITY IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Declining air quality, especially in urban centres, continues to be one of 
  the most serious local environmental problems in Northern Africa and a continuing 
  threat to human health. The three principal anthropogenic causes of declining 
  air quality are energy generation, emissions from vehicles, and industrial production, 
  all of which have increased in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Much of Northern Africa's industrial base was developed in the 1960s and the 
  capital stock of most industries is therefore old and highly polluting. The 
  situation is further complicated by protective trade regimes, foreign exchange 
  constraints, and by dominance of the public sector in industry, all of which 
  provide little incentive for adopting more efficient and cleaner industrial 
  technologies. Few enterprises have air emission controls, and a lack of maintenance 
  and spare parts impairs the performance of existing systems (World Bank 1995).</p>
<p>In many cities in Northern Africa-especially those close to refineries and 
  oil-fired power plants using highsulphur fuel-sulphur dioxide levels reach more 
  than 100 micrograms/m<sup>3</sup>, double the World Health Organization (WHO) 
  standard (World Bank 1999). Industry and the power sector are the sub-region's 
  major sources of sulphur dioxide and total suspended particulates, and are large 
  contributors to nitrogen oxide emissions (90, 80 and 60 per cent respectively). 
  Sulphur dioxide, either dry or dissolved in rain water, causes erosion of infrastructure 
  and monuments as well as soil and water acidification. For example, studies 
  in 1985 and 1995 concluded that sulphur dioxide is a major factor contributing 
  to corrosion of metallic structures in central Cairo and to deterioration of 
  the Sphinx (Hewehy 1993).</p>

<p>Atmospheric concentrations of lead and particulates in Northern Africa often 
  exceed WHO guidelines by a multiple of two to five in large cities. The cement 
  and steel industries produce 50 per cent of the total particulate emissions 
  (World Bank 1995). In Egypt, the Cairo Air Improvement Project (CAIP) reported 
  greatly increased concentrations of lead in industrial districts during 1998, 
  because of excessive lead emissions from smelters. It has been estimated that, 
  prior to 1997, lead emissions from motor vehicles in Cairo were about 700 to 
  1000 tonnes per annum.</p>
<p>The number of motor vehicles in most countries in the sub-region has nearly 
  doubled in the past 10 to 15 years and many vehicles are of older types. Older 
  vehicles emit 20 times more hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and four times 
  more nitrogen oxides than new vehicles. Particulate emissions from poorly maintained 
  diesel-fueled buses and trucks are five to seven times higher than those from 
  similar but wellmaintained vehicles (World Bank 1995, Larsen 1995).</p>
<p>City dwellers in Northern Africa, particularly those in congested metropolitan 
  centres, are exposed to a variety of toxic and carcinogenic compounds including 
  heavy metals and PAHs which contribute to the incidence of respiratory diseases 
  such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. If combined with other pollutants 
  such as sulphur dioxide, suspended particulates can cause bronchitis and other 
  lung diseases. For example, statistics from Egypt's Ministry of Health indicate 
  that, in the areas of Ma'adi and Helwan, chest diseases are the second cause 
  of death after communicable diseases.</p>
