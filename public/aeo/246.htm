<p>Armed conflicts, in addition to exacerbating environmental degradation and 
  increasing human vulnerability, also cause a lot of damage to invaluable environmental 
  resources, especially wildlife and biodiversity, as illustrated in the <a href="#box311">Box 
  3.11</a>. This situation is the same with all the armed conflicts which have 
  taken place or which continue to take place today in Africa.</p>

            <p>The civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been devastating 
              to the country's wildlife, killing thousands of elephants, gorillas 
              (which are among the world's most endangered animals, with only 
              a few hundred surviving in the wild today) and other endangered 
              species. After three years of fighting in the Congo, the number 
              of okapis, gorillas and elephants has dwindled to small populations. 
              Participants in the manysided conflict have plundered resources 
              to fuel the fighting. Soldiers have slaughtered elephants for meat 
              and ivory, and buffalo for meat. </p>
            <p>In Garamba Park in northeastern Congo, an area controlled by Ugandan 
              troops and Sudanese rebels, nearly 4 000 out of 12 000 elephants 
              were killed between 1995 and 1999. In other parks and reserves, 
              including Kahuzi-Biega park, the Okapi reserve and Virunga park, 
              the situation is equally grave. In Kahuzi-Biega park, a zone controlled 
              by the Rwandan and Rwandan-backed rebels, just two out of 350 elephant 
              families remained in 2000- the rest must have fled of their own 
              accord or may have been killed, because two tonnes of elephant tusks 
              were traced in the Bukavu area late in 2000. The war has made both 
              humans and wildlife vulnerable.</p>

<p>Armed conflict not only contributes to the degradation of the environment, 
  but also contributes to the breakdown of legal and institutional frameworks 
  which are critical to environmental management. In Mozambique, the war which 
  ended in 1992 resulted in the fragmentation and collapse of the management of 
  protected areas (Chenje and Johnson 1994). It also foreclosed livelihood options 
  for millions of people who were forcibly displaced to relatively safe areas 
  but which, however, had more limited livelihood options (see <a href="#box312">Box 
  3.12</a>). </p>

            <p>The number of people in critical need of food in the Democratic 
              Republic of Congo remains at an estimated 16 million, or roughly 
              33 per cent of the country's population. The uprooting of rural 
              populations and isolation from their traditional food sources, together 
              with the declining economic situation, continue to be the underlying 
              causes of this troubling situation, which is aggravated at Kinshasa, 
              where about 70 per cent of the population of 7 million live on less 
              than US$1 per day for food. Some 18 per cent of children in the 
              inner city, and more than 30 per cent in the outskirts, suffer from 
              chronic malnutrition. Less than 47 per cent of the population estimated 
              to have access to safe drinking water.</p>

<p>One of the results is that some large communities are forced to survive on 
  food handouts or are forced to overexploit their immediate environment in order 
  to survive. This becomes a vicious circle, where the poor overexploit their 
  resources, limiting the environment's ability to recover. As the state of the 
  environment deteriorates, the people's livelihood options also become limited, 
  worsening their poverty and vulnerability. For example, the 1999 UN secretarygeneral 
  report on the war in Angola, said that among the immediate consequences of the 
  war were the higher level of malnutrition, especially among young children, 
  and the dismal sanitation and health conditions which seriously increased the 
  risk of epidemics (UN 1999). <a href="#box312">Box 3.12</a> also provides additional 
  information on how armed conflicts impact people.</p>
