<p>The very first <i>Africa Environment Outlook</i> report is a significant milestone 
  in the collaboration between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 
  and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN). It should 
  serve as a roadmap, supporting the environmental component, on Africa's journey 
  to sustainable development. It is clear that poverty is inextricably linked 
  to the environment and action to protect and care for the environment must be 
  taken. Otherwise the poison of poverty will continue to plague the continent.</p>
<p>Africa faces a number of critical challenges. The environment continues to 
  deteriorate; social and economic inequality is increasing; globalization is 
  sweeping across the world, largely leaving Africa behind. Rapid changes in the 
  global economy, in consumption patterns and in population and demographics are 
  having a negative impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Without sustainable development we cannot solve the problems. It is not enough 
  to simply say we have a conservation plan for nature, and natural resources. 
  We have also to look at the impact of environmental change on people. The people 
  who are struggling to survive are most vulnerable to environmental change, and 
  suffer most from its effects. We must give these people a chance to live a better 
  life.</p>
<p>Extensive consultations with African experts and collaborating institutions 
  in the AEO process have concluded that the challenges Africa faces require new 
  thinking and vision. There is an urgent need for all stakeholders within Africa, 
  and globally, to act coherently in order to meet the challenges.</p>
<p>The AEO is a unique tool, providing an analysis of the state of the environment 
  over the past 30 years, the driving forces behind environmental change, and 
  the consequences for social and economic development. These consequences are 
  presented both in terms of impacts on ecosystems, and vulnerability of human 
  populations to floods, droughts, earthquakes, pests and diseases. The links 
  between environmental change and poverty are explored, and appropriate intervention 
  points identified. The AEO assessment methodology is modelled on UNEP's Global 
  Environment Outlook process. It builds on sound data, information and science, 
  and input from all stakeholders to identify priority issues.</p>
<p>Africa is a continent of great natural riches, biodiversity and vast unspoiled 
  landscapes. These assets must be valued and preserved, in order to bring benefits 
  to all. The decisions taken today, and tomorrow will define the kind of environment 
  this, and future generations will enjoy. Building on the analysis of the past, 
  AEO outlines a series of policy approaches for the future, leading to different 
  outcomes over the next 30 years. <i>Africa Environment Outlook</i> concludes 
  with recommendations on the road that Africa should take.</p>
<p>The AEO report is therefore a substantive tool for African policy makers to 
  use in their assessment of the pressing environmental issues facing the region. 
  The information in the report can serve as a firm foundation for discussions 
  at the World Summit on Sustainable Development. I trust that many of you will 
  find it a useful aid in preparing for the summit and beyond. I hope that it 
  will inspire you, and all its readers to increase your commitment to care for 
  the environment, especially in Africa.</p>
