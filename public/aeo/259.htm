              rise and agricultural disruption will not be the only causes of

              people globally by 2015, and this would encourage mass migrations.

<a name="box323"></a>Environmental change is making people in Africa more vulnerable, 
with the increase in exposure to risk and inadequate coping capabilities. Many 
factors impact exposure to risk and coping capabilities, and they have social, 
economic and environmental dimensions. Poor economic performance, and weak institutional 
and legal frameworks, as well as overexploitation and other processes, contribute 
to increased human vulnerability. With models suggesting that human vulnerability 
is set to get worse in the future (see <a href="#box323">Box 3.23</a>), the region 
has to adopt strategic measures to mitigate such vulnerability and to improve 
human security.
<p>The likely impacts of increasing human vulnerability in the region over the 
  coming decades include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Increasing poverty, and the targets set under NEPAD to reduce poverty by 
    2015 will remain just that-a target. </li>
  <li>Governments in Africa are likely to pay less attention to the environment 
    as they try to address the basic needs of their people. Environmental policies 
    and institutions are likely, therefore, to remain weak.</li>
  <li> Women and children will continue to bear the brunt of environmental change, 
    particularly in the region. </li>
  <li>Migration-illegal or otherwise-will continue to be a major factor, with 
    millions of people risking their lives to migrate to urban areas and developed 
    regions. </li>
  <li>Overexploitation of the environment will continue (and even increase), making 
    it difficult to break the poverty circle and vulnerability to environmental 
    change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy makers cannot afford to ignore the need to improve environmental management 
  if the human vulnerability/environmental change circle is to be broken. Sustainable 
  development means taking into account social, economic and environmental issues 
  at the same time, not one at a time.</p>
