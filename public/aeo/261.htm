<h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
<h4>OUTLOOK 2002-2032 </h4>
<h2>VISUALISING THE FUTURE</h2>
<p><a href="031.htm">Chapter 2</a> describes the current state of the environment 
  in Africa, outlining its physical attributes in terms of: the atmosphere; land; 
  biodiversity; forests; freshwater, marine and coastal areas; and the urban environment. 
  The chapter demonstrates that the African environment is under constant pressure, 
  primarily from people and from nature. Given the rate at which natural resources 
  are currently being degraded in the region, it is easy to conclude that the 
  African environment is a highly threatened environment, and one in which the 
  future seems mostly uncertain. And so it is not only desirable, but pertinent, 
  that Africans should create a sustainable environment for their current and 
  future needs. It is necessary, therefore, to redefine sustainable development, 
  actively focusing on the reconciliation of the environmental and socioeconomic 
  objectives of development with an adequate consideration of the needs of present 
  and future generations.</p>
<p>An equally pressing issue, addressed in <a href="234.htm">Chapter 3</a>, concerns 
  the fact that vast proportions of the population in various African countries 
  are vulnerable to disasters resulting from the use of the environment and from 
  social tensions which often develop when multitudes of people live together. 
  There is a general belief that it is the poorest people who are most susceptible 
  to these disasters. The poor are also unable to cope with the misfortunes that 
  follow such disasters because coping mechanisms are generally poorly developed 
  in many countries. The need to protect people who are vulnerable to disasters 
  should be a critical component of decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The current state of the African environment, and the vulnerability of large 
  populations in the region to environmental and human-induced disasters, pose 
  an additional challenge to studies of the environment. Much of the challenge 
  relates to the creation and maintenance of a sustainable environment whilst, 
  at the same time, recognizing the need to develop the economic and social resources 
  of nations. The creation of a sustainable development strategy requires insight 
  both into the present and into the future. Since the future is, by definition, 
  unknown, there is a need to develop mechanisms and methodologies which facilitate 
  an understanding of the future.</p>
<p>This chapter will explore, compare and contrast different scenarios regarding 
  the development of the African environment in the future. It will show which 
  of these scenarios has the greatest promise for the region over the next 30 
  years.</p>
