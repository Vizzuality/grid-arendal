<h3>IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE </h3>
<p>Human-induced environmental change, brought about by rapid population growth 
  and overexploitation of natural resources, is considered to be the overriding 
  cause of natural resource degradation, deepening poverty and increasing food 
  insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 1998). Such situations have forced farmers 
  and others dependent on natural resources and agroecological systems to move 
  into low-potential ecosystems, where the resulting damage can worsen and become 
  irreversible. The degradation of natural resources which are essential for future 
  production extends across the agro-ecological system, from the depletion of 
  soil nutrients to overgrazing, overfishing and deforestation (FAO 1998).</p>
<p>Environmentally unsustainable and inappropriate practices are the major human-induced 
  causes of vulnerability. These are exacerbated by the impacts of climatic variations 
  and by interacting with the unique biophysical dynamics, resulting in reduced 
  coping capacities for most of the people already living in environmentally fragile 
  areas.</p>
<p>Some environmental policies also contribute to human vulnerability, for example, 
  the creation of national parks and protected areas without the necessary Environmental 
  Impact Assessment (EIA), which takes into account social, ecological and economic 
  aspects. Such policies, which also include the construction of reservoirs, have 
  been described as 'ecological expropriation'. The growth of protected areas 
  in Africa has been used as an indicator in the generation of 'other environmental 
  refugees'. This category of environmental refugees is different from those impacted 
  by, for example, storms, floods, droughts, fire and El Niño effects. The number 
  of protected areas in Africa grew from 443 (88 662 000 hectares (ha), or 3 per 
  cent of the land area) in 1985 to 746 (154 043 000 ha, or 5.2 per cent) 12 years 
  later. Long-lasting conservation has been devastating for hundreds of thousands 
  of Africans (Geisler and de Sousa 2000). This is mainly as a result of displacement 
  and exclusion. However, there have been positive biodiversity conservation results.</p>

<p><a name="img32"></a>The conversion of natural habitats, such as forests or 
  wetlands, for agriculture and cultivation of marginal areas has not only contributed 
  to land degradation, but has also impacted on people's livelihood options. Desertification 
  processes reportedly affect 46 per cent of Africa and, of that, 55 per cent 
  is under high or very high risk. A total of about 485 million people are impacted 
  (Reich and others, 2001). The projected effects of climate change in Africa 
  include expanding arid areas and increasing variability in rainfall. This threatens 
  to add to the current rate of desertification, a crop yield decline of 10-20 
  per cent in parts of the region, and food insecurity.</p>
<p>With wind and water erosion extensive in many parts of Africa (25 per cent 
  of the land is prone to water erosion and about 22 per cent to wind erosion 
  (Reich and others, 2001)), millions of peasant farmers are constantly at risk 
  of food insecurity. Soil erosion not only reduces productivity of the land, 
  but also requires farmers to utilize more and more fertilizers and other chemicals. 
  While comprehensive data for soil loss rates in Africa are unavailable, estimates 
  from the past three decades range between 900 and 57 000 tonnes/km<sup>2</sup>/annum (t/km<sup>2</sup>/a) 
  (Rattan 1988). For example, more than 800 million ha of soil-representing 60 
  per cent of the total land areas of the semi-arid Sahel region-are affected 
  or threatened by human-induced degradation. Some 224 million ha in the Sahel, 
  in which the Lake Chad basin is located, are already severely degraded. Major 
  causes of soil degradation include cropping activities such as reduced fallow 
  periods, inadequate replenishment of soil nutrients, poorly managed irrigation 
  and overgrazing. During the 1980s, Ethiopia's highlands were reported to have 
  lost 3 million tonnes of topsoil annually (MacKenzie 1987). The cost of erosion 
  in Zimbabwe was estimated to be US$20-50/ha/a on arable land and US$10-80/ha/a 
  on grazing lands (FAO 1990). In South Africa, estimates in 1992-93 reached US$237 
  million, some 15 per cent of gross national agricultural product (Mackenzie 
  1994).</p>

<p>The dependence on rain-fed agriculture increases the risk of food and economic 
  insecurity, especially in areas of high climate variability. Restricted access 
  to foreign markets, heavy agricultural subsidies in OECD countries and limited 
  processing before export add to Africa's vulnerability to international price 
  fluctuations and, therefore, to its failure to realize the full potential of 
  its land resources. OECD countries spend more than US$300 000 million annually-roughly 
  equivalent to the entire GDP of sub-Saharan Africa-on agricultural subsidies 
  (Wolfensohn 2001).</p>
<p>Conflicts over land in Africa have occurred for centuries, but have become 
  more frequent in recent years, most notably since independence from European 
  colonialism. These are complex issues, with conflicts over land resources between 
  races, the state and other stakeholders, and conflicts within and between families 
  and communities. Colonial rule imposed artificial boundaries on African populations, 
  with little or no regard to the community fabric or wildlife habitats, and with 
  damaging effects upon issues such as migration routes of animals. The designation 
  of conservation areas also forced communities off their ancestral land, without 
  compensation. During the past decade, there have been a number of land grabs 
  and retrospective claims against governments, largely due to landlessness and 
  displacement.</p><br clear="all">
