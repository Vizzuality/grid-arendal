<h2><a name="img31"></a>ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: IMPACTS ON PEOPLE </h2>
<p>The environment is life, supporting people and other living things. Environment 
  is widely recognized as a 'pillar' of sustainable development. It provides essential 
  goods and services which contribute to meeting basic human needs, and is essential 
  to human development and quality of life. It provides services to ecosystems, 
  including water catchments which protect freshwater resources, wetlands, riverbank 
  environments, biodiversity habitats and ecologically functioning landscapes. 
  The environment is also a sink of the wastes generated from different human 
  activities.</p>
<p>In Africa, there is a high dependency on agro-sylvoecological systems, which 
  are very sensitive to the impacts of the state of the environment and environmental 
  change. The root causes of environmental change have both natural and humanmade 
  factors, and include interactions between them.</p>
The environmental changes which have occurred in Africa since 1972 have been highlighted 
in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 2</a>, which provides a comprehensive overview of 
the key issues facing the region today. The changes highlighted in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 
2</a> do not only have regional dimensions, but also have sub-regional and national 
implications. Global processes also influence environmental change in Africa, 
for example, greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on climate change. The 
vulnerability of people in the region to environmental change, therefore, manifests 
itself-to a lesser or greater extent-at these different levels, and is a major 
factor in terms of sustainable development in Africa. 
<p>One of the impacts of human vulnerability to environmental change is the forced 
  movement of people, creating what has come to be known as environmental refugees. 
  The notion of environmental refugees describes a new insight on an old phenomenon-large 
  numbers of the world's least secure people seeking refuge from insecure biophysical 
  environments (Geisler and de Sousa 2000). Although the phrase 'environmental 
  refugee' is controversial among advocates of the classical definition of refugees 
  (political and social), it has gained in popular usage. It has been estimated 
  that, globally, there were 25 million environmental refugees in 1994, more than 
  half of whom were in Africa (Myers 1994).<br clear="all"></p>
