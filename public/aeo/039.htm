<h4>Strategies for coping with climate variability in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>All countries of the Northern Africa sub-region have ratified the UNCCD. Tunisia 
  has produced a National Action Programme, and the Union du Maghreb Arabe has 
  produced a sub-regional Action Plan for the Arab countries of Northern Africa 
  (UNCCD 2001). Additional government policies to avoid or mitigate drought include 
  changing agricultural practices and technology and rearranging land use patterns 
  through reduction of cultivation in marginal areas and reduction of fallow periods.</p>

<p>Long-term solutions include an initiative by the Moroccan government to finance 
  job-generating projects in rural areas to keep farmers from abandoning their 
  lands. Officials are also working on expanding irrigation systems to cultivated 
  areas and the use of supplementary irrigation in rain-fed areas (PEACENET 2000). 
  However, policies are needed to improve the ability of societies to understand 
  and detect drought as well as to improve their ability to cope with its effects.</p>
<p>Improved monitoring and forecasting systems, such as modern remote sensing 
  technology, are also required. For example, the impacts of the 1980s drought 
  could have been alleviated if more effective detection and mitigation methods 
  had been available (White 1992).</p>
<p>Improved integrated water resource management can assist in mitigating the 
  intensity and impacts of flooding. Maintenance of wetlands, vegetation cover 
  (especially riparian vegetation) and flood plains improves the ability to soak 
  up excess water and thus reduce the intensity of flooding. Mitigating measures 
  of the research and planning type, such as mapping of hydrological, hydrogeological 
  and land-use patterns, could help to avoid urbanization in areas where there 
  is a risk of flash floods.</p>
