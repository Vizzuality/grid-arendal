<h3><a name="img2a2"></a>AIR QUALITY</h3>
<p>Air quality in Africa is an issue that has emerged over the last few decades, 
  particularly in large urban centres. It has been identified as a priority issue 
  for action because rates of urbanization in Africa are the highest in the world, 
  and there are enormous economic pressures for continued industrial growth.</p>

<p>The air in Africa's urban centres is polluted by emissions from industry, households 
  and vehicles. Major air pollutants from these sources include sulphur dioxide, 
  carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulates, lead, and organic compounds. 
  In most countries, economic pressures to increase industrial output have contributed 
  to rising levels of pollution, and this trend is likely to continue if current 
  development patterns persist (SEI 1998). Policy measures such as high taxes 
  on fuel and on importation of new vehicles have also contributed to emissions, 
  by encouraging the use of dirty fuels and a prevalence of old and more polluting 
  vehicles. Studies in the United States have shown that a car manufactured today 
  produces 70 to 90 per cent less pollution over its lifetime than a car made 
  in the 1970s (CARB 2001a). Conversion to cleaner vehicles is therefore a priority 
  for improvement of urban air quality. Diesel is a commonly used fuel in Africa, 
  especially in commercial trucks and public vehicles, because it is cheaper than 
  petrol. However, the particulate matter emitted from diesel exhausts is small 
  enough to reach deep into the lungs and contains toxic substances such as arsenic, 
  benzene, formaldehyde, nickel, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that 
  have been shown to cause cancer in humans and animals (CARB 2001b). The use 
  of leaded fuel in Africa is also of concern, as very few countries have promoted 
  conversion to unleaded fuel.</p>
<p>In both urban and rural areas, air pollution from domestic combustion of wood, 
  coal, paraffin, crop residues and refuse is a major health issue. Use of these 
  traditional energy sources is driven by lack of investment in rural electrification 
  and high costs of electricity and electrical appliances. These traditional fuels 
  emit toxic pollutants including sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
  aldehydes, dioxin, PAHs and respirable particulate matter. Exposure to such 
  emissions is associated with acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive 
  lung diseases (such as asthma and chronic bronchitis), lung cancer and pregnancy-related 
  problems. Women are particularly susceptible because of their traditional roles 
  as cook which means that they spend more time indoors and close to the pollution 
  sources. Children are also at risk if they spend long periods indoors with their 
  mothers. Other environmental impacts of air pollution include accelerated corrosion 
  rates of buildings and toxicity to water, soil and vegetation. </p>
