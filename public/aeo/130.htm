<h3>TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS </h3>
<p>Since the 1992 'Rio Earth Summit' (UNCED), the issues facing the world's forests, 
  particularly tropical forests in developing countries, have received greater 
  international recognition and been the object of increased local action, as 
  illustrated by <a href="#box2d2">Box 2d.2</a>. Policies aimed at improving forest 
  management and harvesting sustainability include removal of subsidies for commercial 
  logging and privatization of state-owned forests. Greater stakeholder participation 
  in forest management is also emerging and, in some countries, partnerships are 
  being formed between the state or private companies and local communities, including 
  previously dispossessed user groups. Legal frameworks controlling the ownership 
  and use of forests are being reviewed in many African countries (Alden Wily 
  2000, Alden Wily & Mbaya 2001).</p>

            <p>The Global Workshop was convened to support ongoing work of the 
              Intergovernmental Forum on Forests and proposals for action on the 
              underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
            <p>In the African workshop it was agreed that direct causes of deforestation 
              were logging and timber production; fuelwood consumption; forest 
              fires; human settlements; and conversion to agricultural land. Factors 
              hindering Sustainable Forest Management were identified as:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li> poor governance and inappropriate and conflicting policies; 
              </li>
              <li>inadequate macroeconomic policies and access to trade opportunities; 
              </li>
              <li>inadequate institutional capacity and inappropriate technology; 
              </li>
              <li>unsatisfactory tree and land tenure; </li>
              <li>improper valuation of forest resources; </li>
              <li>poverty; </li>
              <li>rapid population growth; </li>
              <li>low levels of awareness and inadequate stakeholder participation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall recommendations of the workshop included the formulation 
              of policies to address:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> Trade and consumption patterns </li>
              <li> Improving indigenous peoples, local communities and other stakeholder 
                involvement (including issues of land tenure) </li>
              <li> Resolving investment and aid policies and financial flows, 
                issues of debt servicing, incentives and subsidies, role of the 
                private sector, governance </li>
              <li> Valuation of forest goods and services, including cultural 
                values and ecosystem services Specific steps identified to combat 
                deforestation in Africa include:</li>
            </ol>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li> providing an enabling policy framework; </li>
              <li>creating awareness; </li>

              <li>provision of adequate resources; </li>
              <li>ensuring equitable distribution of benefits; </li>
              <li>educating the public on forest values; </li>
              <li>reviewing Structural Adjustment Programmes; </li>
              <li>assessing forest resources; </li>
              <li>reforming economic policies; and </li>

<p>The value of timber as well as non-timber forest and woodland products and 
  the value of ecosystem services provided by forests and woodlands are also receiving 
  greater attention, and forest management is being reformed to include these 
  aspects. Information on forests is becoming more accurate and widely available, 
  with the use of technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information 
  systems being used to document and present information. The African Timber Organization 
  (ATO) was formed in 1976 by Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, 
  Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire), Equatorial Guinea, 
  Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sao Tome & Principe, and Tanzania. Collectively, 
  these countries have more than 80 per cent of the total African forest cover. 
  At its first regional seminar (Libreville, Gabon in 1993), the ATO agreed to 
  establish a regional sustainable forest management process with the ATO coordinating 
  the programme and ensuring transparency and credibility. The ATO has developed 
  principles, criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, with 
  assistance from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the the International 
  Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). In May 1996, a preliminary version of criteria 
  and indicators for sustainable forest management was approved and, by 2000, 
  all but nine African countries had embarked on a programme of developing and 
  implementing criteria and indicators, either through the ATO or alternative 
  organizations active in other sub-regions. In Southern Africa, Namibia, South 
  Africa, and Zimbabwe have criteria and indicator programmes set up through The 
  Dry Zone Africa Process, and also have some forest areas certified by the FSC. 
  Most countries have some forest in protected areas, although the amount varies 
  (FAO 2001a). Seventy-seven per cent of Niger's forests are protected, 76 per 
  cent are protected in Rwanda. Djibouti, Egypt, and Eritrea, on the other hand, 
  have no protected forests (FAO 2001a).</p>
<p>To date, sustainable forestry development in Africa has been hampered by inadequate 
  political commitment, weak or inappropriate institutions or policies, weak and 
  poorly funded forestry departments, poor adoption and coordination of funding 
  mechanisms, failure of the international community to translate forest conservation 
  concerns into financial support, and national budgetary constraints (often worsened 
  by Structural Adjustment Programmes). There is a need to encourage local efforts 
  to mobilize resources for forest management in order to reduce donor dependency 
  and to provide support for post-project financing to firmly consolidate the 
  gains made during the life of the project. The African Development Bank is now 
  proposing a consortium approach to remove these barriers and improve funding 
  for sustainable forestry development. The proposed consortium would provide 
  a better channel for obtaining and allocating funding for policy development 
  and sustainable development initiatives (Kufakwandi 2001).</p>
<p>The sub-regional analyses below highlight the priority issues in each area 
  and give further details on the policy and management actions in place to improve 
  the sustainability of use of resources from Africa's forests and woodlands.</p>
