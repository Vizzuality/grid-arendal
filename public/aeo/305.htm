<h5>Urban areas</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, rapid urban growth exerts pressure for housing 
  and infrastructure investments, in order to accommodate the rapidly growing 
  population. However, the system of urban governance is responsive to the needs 
  of the élite, and not to the needs of the poor majority. This situation leads 
  to the mushrooming of informal housing and slum areas, which account for the 
  majority of African urban dwellers. These informal settlements are not provided 
  with adequate transport, water, sanitation, electricity and health services. 
  People living in these areas are exposed to various health hazardous. Housing 
  finance systems are non-existent, or are limited to élite bubbles.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the urban economy and environment leads to widespread 
  urban poverty, beyond known historical norms. As a consequence, crime becomes 
  a major problem in most African cities, and worsens with increased poverty and 
  deteriorating living conditions. The streets of most cities become completely 
  unsafe, even in daylight.</p>
<p>The élite, who live in enclaves, produce much higher municipal waste, per capita, 
  than those outside of the enclaves. This waste is dumped, without regard for 
  costly hygiene measure, in sites outside of the gated cities inhabited by the 
  poor. This exacerbates land and water degradation, leading to the spread of 
  disease.</p>
<p>The African region is the cradle of many of the world's oldest civilizations 
  and cities, and it traditionally attracted a significant share of worldwide 
  tourism. In the Fortress World scenario, instead of revitalizing and preserving 
  these assets to empower communities and to strengthen their economic base, these 
  assets become threatened by neglect and environmental degradation. The élite, 
  using authoritarian solutions, succeed in protecting some of the cultural heritage, 
  but their incentive is to reap the benefits and to project a civilized image 
  to the international community.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>This sub-region continues to witness an increased concentration of populations 
  in urban areas. The Fortress World scenario is characterized by uncontrolled 
  urban growth, outdated urban settlement planning and increased poverty in cities. 
  The high population pressure affects the consumption of natural resources, and 
  is linked to the poverty of city-dwellers. Uncontrolled urbanization leads to 
  the emergence of places in which no provision is made for green spaces and, 
  where such provision is made, it is not respected. Because of lack of solid 
  and liquid waste planning and management programmes, the issue of sanitation 
  becomes more acute, and impacts the health of the population through frequent 
  outbreaks of new diseases.</p>
