<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>The main issues of concern regarding the atmosphere in Southern Africa are 
  the occurrence of flooding and droughts arising from climate variability, impacts 
  of climate change on vegetation systems, biodiversity, freshwater availability, 
  food production and localized air quality problems associated with emissions 
  from industry, vehicles and use of domestic fuels.</p>

<p>Rainfall in Southern Africa is strongly influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence 
  Zone (ITCZ), a zone close to the equator where massive rain-bearing clouds form 
  when the South East Trade Wind (from the south east of the continent) meets 
  the North East Monsoon Winds. The ITCZ changes position during the year, oscillating 
  between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, and its southward movement 
  usually marks the beginning of a rainy season. The further south the zone moves, 
  the more promising this is considered to be for the rainy season. In a normal 
  season, the ITCZ can exert an influence between mid- Tanzania and southern Zimbabwe 
  and is associated with favourable rainfall. Another system, the Botswana High, 
  often tends to push the ITCZ away, resulting in periods of drought.</p>
<p>The ENSO also influences Southern Africa's climate, tending to bring either 
  heavy rains often accompanied by severe floods (as in 1999/2000 when Mozambique 
  was exceptionally hard hit), or drought (as in 1982/83 when much of Southern 
  Africa was severely affected) (National Drought Mitigation Center 2000).</p>
<p>In the wet season, normal rainfall in Southern Africa ranges from 50 mm to 
  over 1000 mm. Recent weather patterns have, however, been erratic with severe 
  droughts recorded in 1967-73, 1981-83, 1986/87, 1991/92 and 1993/4. Floods have 
  also been observed, most notably across most of Southern Africa in 1999/2000 
  (Chenje & Johnson 1994, WMO 2000).</p>
<p>The drought of 1991/2 was the severest on record, causing a 54 per cent reduction 
  in cereal harvest and exposing more than 17 million people to risk of starvation 
  (Calliham, Eriksen and Herrick 1994). Zimbabwe alone imported an additional 
  800 000 tonnes of maize, 250 000 tonnes of wheat, and 200 000 tonnes of sugar 
  (Makarau 1992). Water and electricity shortages resulted in a 9 per cent reduction 
  in manufacturing output and a 6 per cent reduction in foreign exchange (Benson 
  & Clay 1994).</p>
<p>Cyclone Eline, which hit south-eastern Africa in 1999/2000, affected 150 000 
  families and wreaked havoc in Mozambique where it caused US$273 million worth 
  of physical damage, and cost US$295 million in lost production, and US$31 million 
  in food imports (Mozambique National News Agency 2000).</p>
<p>A combination of dry spells, severe floods, and disruption of farming activities 
  between 1999 and 2001 has left Southern Africa with meagre food reserves. Several 
  of the sub-region's countries have faced food shortages (FAO 2001a).</p>
<h4>Strategies for coping with climate variability in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has developed a Sub-Regional 
  Action Programme to Combat Desertification in southern Africa, in line with 
  the UNCCD. All of the countries in the Southern African sub-region are party 
  to the UNCCD, and Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have also 
  produced National Action Plans (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>Early warning and response strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate 
  variability are relatively well developed in the sub-region (see <a href="#box2a4">Box 
  2a.4</a>) and a drought fund is in place to mitigate the effects of poor rainfall 
  (Chimhete 1997). However, monitoring, research, and preparedness strategies 
  need further strengthening. This is evidenced by the response to cyclone Eline-according 
  to some sources, the early warning systems did not supply sufficient information 
  about the extent of the impacts of the cyclone, resulting in the loss of many 
  lives that could have been saved (CNN 2000).</p>

              the 1991-1992 drought, the unit altered national agencies and donors 
              in time to increase food imports and request food aid.</p>
