<p>The land and its resources are the cornerstones of Africa's culture and development. 
  Pastoralism and subsistence agriculture are the traditional practices but commercial 
  plantation agriculture has been promoted over the past 30 years, particularly 
  in Western and Central Africa, as the foundation of economic growth. However, 
  Africa's soils are not generally suited to cultivation, rainfall is variable 
  in much of Africa and irrigation has been developed in only a few countries. 
  Dependence on agriculture (in particular a narrow range of crops) has therefore 
  had economic and environmental drawbacks.</p>
<p>National development policies and international trade agreements and/or restrictions 
  have also affected agricultural development and natural resource quality. Soils 
  and vegetation are being degraded largely as a result of increasing use of inorganic 
  chemicals, reduction of fallow systems, increased monoculture, and cultivation 
  of marginal areas. In Eastern and Southern Africa conflict between user groups 
  over land and resources is the priority issue, resulting from competition between 
  agriculture, pastoralists, and conservation areas, and from complex and inappropriate 
  land tenure policies.</p>
<p>Desertification is another serious concern in Africa, particularly in the more 
  arid zones where climate variability and poor land management practices combine 
  to threaten the sustained productivity of soil and vegetation.</p>
<p>Land tenure reform, international cooperation, and integration of land resource 
  management with development goals are required. Monitoring of climatic patterns 
  and strategies to alleviate the pressures that economic growth places on terrestrial 
  resources are additional priorities if Africa is to achieve sustainable development 
  and protect its resource base. <a href="#fig2s6">Figure 2s.6</a> illustrates 
  the land issues facing Africa.</p>
