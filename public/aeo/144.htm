<h3>FOREST COVER AND QUALITY IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Deforestation, forest degradation and the associated loss of forest products 
  and environmental services are serious challenges facing Western African countries. 
  Between 1990 and 2000, a total of 12 million hectares of forest were cleared, 
  15 per cent of the sub-regional total (FAO 2001a). These high rates of deforestation 
  are largely attributable to governmental concessions on commercial logging. 
  The timber and wood products are mostly exported to earn foreign currencies 
  and contribute a considerable amount to GDP. Forests have also been cleared 
  for agriculture, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s when high incomes could 
  be earned from cash crops such as coffee, cotton, and sugar.</p>
<p>National policies for infrastructure development have also contributed to fragmentation 
  of forests. The process starts with the construction of large access roads by 
  logging companies which encourages the rural farming communities to settle deep 
  inside the forest where the soils are most fertile. Other policies have played 
  an indirect role in deforestation over the last 30 years. For example, governments 
  have encouraged the conversion of forest reserves into agricultural lands in 
  order to attract and resettle people from more densely populated and resource 
  deficient areas. In addition, forest reserves have been converted into plantations 
  to satisfy industrial demand for wood (Asibey 1990).</p>
<p>Collection of fuelwood contributes to forest clearance and degradation through 
  selective harvesting. The use of wood for fuel is likely to increase, according 
  to predictions by the FAO (2001b), due to a rapidly increasing population and 
  demands for energy which cannot be met by alternative sources in the short to 
  medium term.</p>
<p>Current logging methods are destructive, and it has been estimated that to 
  harvest 1m<sup>3</sup> of log, about 2m<sup>3</sup> of standing trees are destroyed 
  (Serageldine 1990). This in turn significantly modifies the ecosystem by creating 
  gaps in the canopy, exposing shade-adapted species to sunlight and allowing 
  colonization by new species. Removal of vegetation has also increased the potential 
  for soil erosion and run-off. This is especially problematic on steep slopes 
  or in fragile ecosystems such as the mangroves and transitional marginal forests 
  or derived savanna areas that have lower regeneration capacity than humid forests. 
  Furthermore, it takes up to 700 years to restore a fully balanced, mature forest. 
  Natural forests are therefore usually replaced by secondary forests which do 
  not afford the same level of resources and services as primary forests. These 
  secondary forest areas then typically become sources of local firewood collection, 
  are converted to plantations, or used for grazing, activities which further 
  degrade or destroy them.</p>
<p>Forest clearance and degradation are increasing in most countries in Western 
  Africa because of increasing population pressures for agricultural land and 
  for energy use. Population growth is linked directly to increased demand for 
  food and occupancy of space. However, it is the local communities that often 
  suffer most from forest degradation as they lose vital sources of firewood, 
  construction materials, clothing, pharmaceutical products, food, hunting accessories, 
  cultural and religious apparatus and grazing land for animals. Civil strife 
  and its repercussions can fuel deforestation by creating needs for shelter and 
  energy among refugees who will attempt to meet such needs from the forest.</p>
<p>Forests, especially dense tropical forests, play a vital role in carbon sequestration 
  and therefore in global climate regulation, as well as in regulating local air 
  quality and rainfall patterns. When forest cover is removed not only are these 
  global functions lost but often-because the presence of forest reduces temperatures 
  and evaporation, and limits the negative impacts of wind-a microclimate conducive 
  to the development of animal life and vegetation growth is also lost,. Clearing 
  of the forest therefore limits the maintenance of a vibrant biological diversity.</p>
