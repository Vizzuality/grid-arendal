<p>About two decades age, African environment ministers met in the Egyptian capital, 
  Cairo, to lay the foundation of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment 
  (AMCEN), the supreme continental forum responsible for articulating authoritative 
  perspectives on Africa's environment and its place in the global arena. AMCEN 
  was established against a backdrop of deteriorating state of environment as 
  well as increasing social and economic inequality and their impacts on the regions 
  environment. However, and from the outset, the Organisation of African Unity 
  (OAU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) have been 
  particularly supportive of the work of AMCEN as the environmental voice of conscience 
  of the region, thereby highlighting the interdependence of environment, social 
  and economic issues and the political commitment to work in concert in the interest 
  of the wellbeing of the peoples of Africa.</p>
<p>Despite the achievements registered since its establishment, AMCEN still faces 
  daunting challenges, including amongst others: harmonization of sub-regional 
  and regional environmental issues in order that they receive equal attention 
  at these levels; translation of global environmental concerns into practical, 
  feasible and achievable programmes of action at national, sub-regional and regional 
  levels; the positioning of AMCEN within the framework of new and emerging issues 
  at regional and global level (the African Union, NEPAD, etc.); enhancing AMCEN's 
  advocacy role in the new global economic order and, in particular, voicing Africa's 
  concerns in the intergovernmental organizations (e.g. WTO, IMF, WB) that are 
  beginning to place environmental considerations very high in their decision 
  making processes; and, promoting and according environmental concerns priority 
  status within national development processes.</p>
<p>The efforts of AMCEN to address these challenges are the subject of the first 
  ever regional comprehensive report on the state of Africa's environment-<i>Africa 
  Environment Outlook</i> (AEO). The report, which was specifically requested 
  by AMCEN, traces environment and development trends since the 1972 United Nations 
  Conference on the Human Environment, provides a comprehensive analysis of status 
  and trends of the environment in Africa integrated with the impacts of policies, 
  laws and regional agreements, and proposes alternative policy options for the 
  future as well as recommends concrete policy actions for follow-up at national 
  and sub-regional levels.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this report will provide a valuable opportunity for AMCEN 
  to take stock of its policy performance and effectiveness since inception in 
  1985, look into the future and access the various policy options for consideration 
  at national, subregional and regional levels, and also serve as a basis for 
  AMCEN to reorient its focus and programmes in light of the findings and recommendations 
  contained in the report.</p>
<p>The AEO report also highlights some of the major issues to be addressed at 
  the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) to be held in Johannesburg, 
  South Africa in late August 2002. It is the basis upon which Africa and its 
  cooperating partners, both bilateral and multilateral can engage each other 
  to determine how best to tackle some of the pressing challenges facing Africa. 
  It is also our hope that emerging initiatives under African Union and the New 
  Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and its environmental Component, 
  will be able to take advantage of the information contained in this report, 
  in particular policy recommendations, to advance their programmes of work for 
  the future. These new initiatives provide a challenge for the future AEO process 
  as the African development paradigm shifts beyond WSSD.</p>
<p>The success of the AEO process requires special mention in view of the unique 
  approach adopted in the production of the report. It has engendered participation 
  from a wide range of stakeholders, built consensus on several issues and findings, 
  cultivated a sense of ownership and clearly demonstrated the need to build from 
  the bottom up. It is through this unique approach that the AEO report has established 
  a strong foundation for the harmonization of integrated environmental assessment 
  and reporting processes in the Africa region. It is hoped that in the short 
  term the assessment and reporting methodologies will be adopted and become fully 
  incorporated in national level environmental management practices.</p>
<p>The AEO report and process are clear testimony of Africa's capacity to undertake 
  specialized scientific work for itself and not rely on northern-based institutions 
  to analyse, articulate and make recommendations on Africa's own issues. AEO 
  is the basis for the African renaissance in environmental terms.</p>
<p>I trust the report will be useful to all who subscribe to the attainment of 
  sustainable development in Africa for the benefit of present and future generations.</p>
