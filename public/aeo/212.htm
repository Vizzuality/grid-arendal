<h4>Management of pollution and waste in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>The growing populations in urban centres in the Western Indian Ocean Islands, 
  together with the growing number of visitors and patterns of increased consumption, 
  are producing greater and greater volumes of solid waste. In Mauritius more 
  than 1 000 tonnes of solid waste are generated every day, mostly in the capital, 
  Port Louis, and other urban centres (UNEP 1998). However, solid waste collection 
  and disposal services in urban areas in the sub-region are somewhat dysfunctional. 
  For example, in Antananarivo, Madagascar, it is estimated that only 25 per cent 
  of solid waste is collected. Lack of waste collection encourages illegal dumping 
  of wastes by households and municipalities, and uncontrolled roadside dumping, 
  or dumping on the beaches, as in Comoros (UNEP 1999, UNEP 1998). Lack of suitable 
  landfill sites, especially on the smaller islands complicates the problem, and 
  burning in the open is common. Burning presents a threat to public health and 
  air quality. Water quality is also threatened when solid waste is dumped in 
  or near surface and groundwater resources (UNEP 1998). Some of the waste generated 
  in the sub-region is recycled. For example, Madagascar and Mauritius recycle 
  paper, textiles, and metal. In Mauritius glass, precious metals, and plastics 
  are also recycled (UNEP 1998).</p>
<p>Intensive animal rearing, especially the pasturing of goats around urban areas 
  creates pressures on the environment and human health if the waste is not disposed 
  of properly. Contamination and eutrophication of water courses lower the ability 
  of the natural systems to provide vital functions such as water quality regulation 
  and nutrient cycling, as well as impacting on biodiversity and providing breeding 
  sites for parasites and bacteria.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>The establishment of urban planning regulations, waste management and raising 
  of public awareness are improving the situation in some parts of the Islands. 
  But more needs to be done, especially in islands where urbanization and population 
  are growing rapidly and where residential and industrial developments combine 
  their pressures on the urban environment. In old towns and cities, the road, 
  water, sanitation and traffic management infrastructure is in urgent need of 
  radical renewal and attention is being given to decentralizing the population 
  through better spatial planning for industry, government and residential population 
  areas.</p>
<p>The Cities Alliance, to which Antananarivo, Madagascar, is a partner, held 
  a special session in February 2001, at which Madagascar's Minister for Regional 
  and Urban Development reported that significantly more investment is required 
  to keep pace with a rapidly urbanizing population. The Government of Madagascar 
  has conducted extensive consultations with local authorities, civil society 
  and international partners, and has formulated a Poverty Reduction Strategic 
  Programme, focused at the local level and, in particular, on provision of infrastructure 
  and creation of employment. Activities include the development of planning and 
  monitoring tools and a campaign to develop municipal awareness and capacities.</p>
<p>Also in Madagascar, the World Bank has funded a slum upgrading and city development 
  strategy for Antsirabe, Antsiranana, Mahajanga, and Toamasina, as well as an 
  integrated municipal programme for poverty reduction in Fianarantsoa and Tulear. 
  Community participation has been a significant component of both projects, and 
  replicable methodologies have been established (UNCHS/ROAAS 2001).</p>
