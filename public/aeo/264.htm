<h2>AFRICA REGIONAL FUTURES: SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT IN THE AEO</h2>
<p> The development of scenarios in the AEO followed the pattern described in 
  the GEO. As with the <i>GEO-3</i> report, scenarios are based on the work of 
  the Global Scenarios Group (GSG) (Gallopin and others, 1997). The GSG uses a 
  two-tier hierarchy, described as 'classes' and 'variants', to categorize scenarios. 
  Classes are distinguished by fundamentally different social visions, while variants 
  reflect a range of possible outcomes within each class. The three broad classes 
  are 'Conventional Worlds', 'Barbarization' and 'Great Transitions'. These are 
  characterized, respectively, by: essential continuity with today's evolving 
  development patterns; fundamental, but undesirable, social change; and fundamental 
  and favourable social transformations. For each of the three classes, two variants 
  are defined, giving a total of six scenarios. Thus, in the 'Conventional Worlds' 
  class, the two scenarios that are emerging are 'Conventional Development' and 
  'Policy Reform'. The two scenarios in the 'Barbarization' class are 'Breakdown' 
  and the 'Fortress World'. In the 'Great Transitions' class, the two scenarios 
  are 'Ecocommunalism' and the 'New Sustainability Paradigm'.</p>

<p><a name="fig43"></a>The 'Conventional Worlds' class envisions the global system 
  of the 21st century evolving without major surprises, sharp discontinuities 
  or fundamental transformations in the basis for human civilization. The future 
  is shaped by the continued evolution, expansion and globalization of the dominant 
  values and socioeconomic relationships of industrial society. In contrast, the 
  'Barbarization' and 'Great Transition' classes relax the notion of the long-term 
  continuity of dominant values and institutional arrangements. Indeed, these 
  scenarios envision profound historical transformations in the fundamental organizing 
  principles of society over the next century, perhaps as significant as the transition 
  to settled agriculture and the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Within the 'Conventional Worlds' class, the 'Reference' variant incorporates 
  mid-range population and development projections, and typical technological 
  change assumptions. The 'Policy Reform' variant adds strong, comprehensive and 
  coordinated government action, as called for in many policy-oriented discussions 
  of sustainability, in order to achieve greater social equity and environmental 
  protection. In this variant, the political will evolves for strengthening management 
  systems and for the rapid diffusion of environmentally friendly technology. 
  Whatever their differences, the two 'Conventional Worlds' variants share a number 
  of premises: the continuity of institutions and values; the rapid growth of 
  the world economy; and the convergence of global regions toward the norms set 
  by highly industrialized countries. Environmental stress arising from global 
  population and economic growth is left to the self-correcting logic of competitive 
  markets. In the 'Policy Reform' variant, sustainability is pursued as a proactive 
  strategic priority.</p>
<p>The 'Barbarization' variants envision the grim possibility that the social, 
  economic and moral underpinnings of civilization deteriorate, as emerging problems 
  overwhelm the coping capacity of both markets and policy reforms. The 'Breakdown' 
  variant leads to unbridled conflict, institutional disintegration and economic 
  collapse. The 'Fortress World' variant features an authoritarian response to 
  the threat of breakdown. In this scenario, ensconced in protected enclaves, 
  Èlites safeguard their privileges by controlling an impoverished majority and 
  by managing critical natural resources while, outside the fortress, there is 
  repression, environmental destruction and misery.</p>

<p><a name="fig44"></a>Further reflections indicate the need to reclassify these 
  into four distinct categories. The four categories, adopted from the GEO, are: 
  'Conventional Development', later renamed 'Market Forces', 'Policy Reform', 
  'Fortress World' and the 'Great Transitions'. These are the four scenarios that 
  are used in the AEO. <a href="#fig43">Figure 4.3</a> shows the sketches of the 
  behaviour over time for six descriptive variables on these four scenarios, namely: 
  population growth; economic scale; environmental quality; social and economic 
  equity; technological change; and the degree of social and geopolitical conflict. 
  The curves are intended as rough illustrations only of the possible patterns 
  of change.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the four scenarios may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Market Forces scenario: market-driven global development leads to convergence 
    toward dominant values and development patterns;</li>
  <li>Åo Policy Reform scenario: incremental policy adjustments steer conventional 
    development towards environmental and poverty-reduction goals;</li>
  <li>Fortress World scenario: as socioeconomic and environmental stresses mount, 
    the world descends toward fragmentation, extreme inequality and widespread 
    conflict; and</li>
  <li>Great Transitions scenario: a new development paradigm emerges in response 
    to the challenge of sustainability, distinguished by pluralism, planetary 
    solidarity, and new values and institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenario development proceeds in one of two directions. In the first case, 
  one begins with the current position and then proceeds to make projections into 
  the future. Such a strategy may be described as 'forecasting'. On the other 
  hand, one can begin with the desirable future, and seek to manipulate variables 
  and resources to achieve this future. Such an approach is described as 'back-casting'(see 
  <a href="#fig44">Figure 4.4</a>). Two of the scenarios described above (the 
  Market Forces scenario and the Fortress World scenario) may be achieved by methods 
  of forecasting, while the other two scenarios (the Policy Reform scenario and 
  the Great Transitions scenario) are best achieved by methods of backcasting, 
  a procedure adopted in this study.</p>
