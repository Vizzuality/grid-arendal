<h5>Freshwater</h5>

  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, water remains vital to both the agricultural 
  and the industrial development process. Unfortunately, a large proportion of 
  the region is semi-arid, with very low annual rainfall. Droughts have, therefore, 
  become a major feature of weather and climate all over Africa, and the effects 
  have been difficult to contain. In many countries, there is uneven distribution 
  of water and land suitable for agriculture, and this affects the potential of 
  agricultural production. Serious stress on water occurs in countries such as 
  Djibouti, Mauritania, Somalia, Algeria and Sudan, and in many countries in Western 
  Africa and Southern and Eastern and Eastern Africa (Chenje and Johnson 1996). 
  The problem of water shortages are carefully addressed and eliminated.</p>

  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>Localized freshwater availability continues to be a problem, especially in 
  the semi-arid parts of the subregion (Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti and north-eastern 
  Kenya). In the Great Transitions scenario, investment in large-scale water redistribution 
  schemes is likely to take place in the next 30 years, particularly focusing 
  on the water of the Blue Nile and its tributaries. Large-scale irrigation schemes 
  may be developed in the Ethiopian lowlands. Concerted diplomatic moves are witnessed 
  in the direction of shared water resources, in order to increase equitable distribution 
  in the sub-region. Subregional groupings around the shared water resources, 
  such as the Nile Basin Organization (NBO), become stronger and more influential 
  in driving economic development in the sub-region.</p>

<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the existing water scarcity problem absorbs 
  the full attention and consideration of governments in the sub-region. The sub-region 
  takes sufficient measures to ease the problem, through careful and sustainable 
  management of conventional water resources. Furthermore, the management of non-conventional 
  resources-such as rainfall harvesting, desalination and water recycling- are 
  implemented and adapted to the local conditions. The industrial revolution experienced 
  in the sub-region helps to lower the cost of these new techniques, to the extent 
  that they become affordable to many sectors. In addition, all the countries 
  adopt integrated water resources management programmes to effectively manage 
  all available water resources. In Egypt and the Sudan, the concept of integrated 
  water resources management is extended across the boundaries of each country, 
  to include the rest of the Nile riparian countries. The experience gained whilst 
  implementing integrated water resources management procedures is exchanged by 
  experts during regular meetings organized at the sub-regional level.</p>

<p>Water scarcity is a big issue in Southern Africa, and may continue to be dominant 
  during the next 30 years. In the Great Transitions scenario, for the sake of 
  human sustainability, small-scale water-harvesting technologies may become prominent 
  in the sub-region. Wasteful water consumption patterns, such as inappropriate 
  irrigation practices, may slowly be replaced with more efficient systems, such 
  as drip or micro-jet irrigation, as well as proper economic accounting and costing 
  of water.</p>

  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>With advanced water management and protection skills, there are freshwater 
  supplies all year round, and they are available in all parts of the region. 
  The net benefits are shared throughout the sub-region under the ECOWAS agreements 
  and protocols.</p>

<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the hitherto lack of enforcement of public 
  health legislation on water protection becomes a thing of the past. Governments 
  call for community service orders to enlist communities in environmentally clean 
  projects, as an alternative to custodial care.</p>
