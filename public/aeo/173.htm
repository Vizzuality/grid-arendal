<p>In response to growing domestic populations in Africa, and to policies directed 
  at economic growth through agricultural export, the extent of land under cultivation 
  has risen steadily from 166 million ha in 1970 to 202 million ha in 1999. The 
  area of land under permanent pasture increased rapidly during the latter half 
  of the 1980s, and then declined sharply to 892 million hectares in 1999 (approximately 
  the same as in 1970) (FAOSTAT 2001).</p>
<p>Absolute productivity over the past 30 years has also increased for both crops 
  and livestock (see <a href="#fig2f2">Figure 2f.2</a> and <a href="#fig2f3">Figure 
  2f.3</a>). However, the gains in cultivated area and productivity have been 
  outweighed by rapid population growth and, hence, increased demands on food 
  supply. For example, despite increases in crop production of 2.3 per cent in 
  1998 and 2.1 per cent in 1999, population growth averaged 2.5 per cent and, 
  therefore, per capita crop production declined (FAO 2001c). Average per capita 
  arable land which is actually cultivated has also fallen, as a result of population 
  growth, from 0.5 ha/capita in 1965 to 0.3 ha/capita in 1990 (Cleaver and Schreiber 
  1994).</p>
<p>Limited economic growth, and myriad land tenure policies and management practices 
  (including the increasingly widespread poverty and marginalization of subsistence 
  farmers) have also contributed to limited gains in nutritional status, and to 
  increasing dependence on food aid. Although average per capita daily calorie 
  consumption has increased slightly, the number of undernourished people in Africa 
  has doubled since 1970 (FAO 2000a). The region is a net importer of cereal crops 
  for domestic consumption, and the ratio of imports to exports is escalating. 
  Recurrent drought has resulted in crop failures and an inability to accumulate 
  food reserves, and civil wars have restricted food distribution. Consequently, 
  over the past 30 years, millions of people have faced food shortages. In 2000, 
  these totalled 28 million in sub-Saharan Africa, in at least 16 countries (FAO 
  2001d).</p>
