<h2>REGIONAL OVERVIEW </h2>
<p>Forests and woodlands have played a critical role in the survival of human 
  populations. They have been direct providers of shelter and food for people 
  and their livestock, and of water, medicinal plants, building materials and 
  fuel. But forests and woodlands also regulate our environment indirectly by 
  slowing soil erosion, controlling run-off of rainwater and storing it, and regulating 
  its release into our rivers and lakes. Globally, they help to regulate the climate 
  and protect coastlines. Furthermore, forests and woodlands sustain many of our 
  cultural, spiritual and religious values as well as playing an important role 
  in the socio-economic development of industrial countries and being a vital 
  resource for the socio-economic stability of developing ones. Loss of forests 
  and woodlands therefore means loss of a vital resource and disruption of the 
  socioeconomic activities they support. The emphasis in recent years on sustainable 
  development has meant that the use of forests and woodlands has come under greater 
  scrutiny in order to preserve a healthy resource base and sustain social and 
  economic benefits.</p>

<p><a name="fig2d1"></a>Tracking long term trends in forest cover involves the 
  compilation and analysis of large quantities of data that are not always consistent 
  or comparable and the task is further complicated by different definitions of 
  what constitutes 'forest' (IPCC 2000, UNEP 2001, Matthews, Payne, Rohweder & 
  Murray 2001). Forests may be defined in terms of administrative categories, 
  land use or land cover (IPCC 2000). The United Nations Food and Agriculture 
  Organization (FAO), in collaboration with UNEP and the UN Economic Commission 
  for Europe (UNECE) produces an assessment of the world's forests every 10 years. 
  These are widely cited, and much of the information presented below is taken 
  from the 2000 FAO Forest Resources Assessment. For the FAO report, the term 
  'forest' means land with a tree canopy cover of more than 10 per cent and area 
  of more than 0.5 hectares, and a minimum tree height of 5 m. A canopy cover 
  threshold of 10 per cent can include land that might be considered tundra, wooded 
  grassland, savanna or scrubland (Matthews 2001). The discussion in this section 
  will, therefore, include forests, woodlands and savannas. It should be noted 
  that natural events and human activities can affect open and closed canopy forests 
  in different ways.</p>
Forests cover approximately 30 per cent of the world's surface, with tropical 
and subtropical forests (and woodlands) comprising 56 per cent, temperate and 
boreal forests accounting for 44 per cent. These are all natural forests with 
the exception of 5 per cent of forest plantations, (FAO 2001a). It has been estimated 
that, since pre-agricultural times, global forest cover has been reduced by at 
least 20 per cent, and perhaps by as much as 50 per cent (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank 
& WRI 2000). 
<p>The total forest cover in Africa was estimated to be just under 650 million 
  hectares in 2000, equivalent to 17 per cent of the global forest cover, and 
  approximately 22 per cent of Africa's land area (FAO 2001a). Africa has 14 different 
  types of forest, in temperate and tropical climates, as shown in <a href="#fig2d1">Figure 
  2d.1</a>, although the extent of forest cover varies between sub-regions. Forests 
  make up approximately 45 per cent of the land area of Central Africa, constituting 
  37 per cent of Africa's total forest cover. In contrast, only 8 per cent of 
  the land area of countries in Northern Africa have forest cover and most of 
  this is in Sudan (FAO 2001a).</p>
