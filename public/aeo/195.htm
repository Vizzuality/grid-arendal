<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN CENTRAL AFRICA </h3>
<p>Land degradation, defined as the deterioration in the quality and productive 
  capacity of land (Benneh, Agyepong and Allotey 1990), has been identified as 
  one of the major environmental challenges facing the central Africa sub-region. 
  The main contributors to land degradation in this sub-region are erosion and 
  soil compacting, as a result of extensive removal of vegetation, and exposure 
  of the soils to heavy rainfall, increased evaporation and wind action. The main 
  reasons for vegetation removal are commercial logging and tree cutting to provide 
  domestic fuel, as well as clearance of forests for commercial or subsistence 
  cultivation.</p>
<p>The rate of forest loss in central Africa is a cause for concern in terms of 
  its impacts on biodiversity, atmospheric change and hydrological cycles, in 
  addition to the concerns regarding soil erosion (UNU 1998). Chemical degradation 
  also occurs, because of: intensive cultivation of marginal areas without sufficient 
  fallowing; use of chemical rather than organic fertilizers; and salinization, 
  through inundation with saltwater or irrigation with poor quality water. For 
  example, the Congo basin has lost more than 1 million ha of original forest 
  cover, contributing to soil erosion and the sedimentation of waterbodies (WRI 
  2001). The Lake Chad basin has also suffered severe vegetation loss, and potential 
  for soil loss and desertification is high (WRI 2001).</p>

<a name="img2f7"></a> Declining productivity and soil structure in the Sahelian 
zones of Chad and Cameroon are exacerbated by unpredictable rainfall and drought, 
resulting in extreme degradation and desertification. Chad is currently experiencing 
the greatest vulnerability to desertification, with 58 per cent of the area already 
classified as desert, and 30 per cent classified as highly or extremely vulnerable 
(Reich and others 2001). There is a large area in Democratic Republic of Congo 
(64 per cent), which is classified as hyper-arid, and sands of the Kalahari desert 
have encroached on the savanna vegetation (Reich and others 2001). Central African 
Republic and northern Cameroon have also been experiencing desertification since 
the severe drought of 1972-73 (Njinyam 1998).
<p>In the coming decades, the threat of desertification will increase, as a result 
  of climatic changes, such as: increased evaporation; reduced rainfall and run-off; 
  and increased frequency and severity of drought (IPCC 2001). In addition, civil 
  unrest or conflict can result in vast movements of refugees, many of whom are 
  settled in marginal or fragile areas. Such social and environmental pressures 
  were clearly demonstrated in 1997, when Central African Republic (having to 
  cope with internal disputes) received more than 50 000 refugees from Sudan, 
  Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Brazzaville and Rwanda. The arrival 
  of these displaced persons put a visible strain on the already stressed food 
  security situation (Njinyam 1998).</p>
<p>The consequences of land degradation, and of soil erosion and compaction, are 
  manifest as a result of the declining ability to support natural or domesticated 
  plant and animal production. Ultimately, this translates to reduced nutritional 
  status of the population and to reduced export revenues. In addition, communities 
  which are dependent on wild produce-such as fruits, nuts, animals and mushrooms, 
  and wood for fuel-have to search further and further afield to meet their needs, 
  and may experience food shortages or even famine during drought years. Extreme 
  reductions in productivity may result in people abandoning their farms and migrating 
  to urban centres, in search of improved security.</p>
<h4>Improving land quality and productivity in Central Africa </h4>
<p>Political and economic development policies, as well as conflicts and civil 
  unrest, have also played a role in declining food security in parts of the sub-region, 
  as shown by the example of Cameroon in <a href="#box2f6">Box 2f.6</a>. A comprehensive, 
  integrated approach to improving food security and land quality is, therefore, 
  a current environmental and developmental priority for central Africa. To this 
  end, countries of the sub-region have ratified UNCCD. Chad and Cameroon are 
  the only countries to have so far produced national reports, however, and Chad 
  has also produced a National Action Plan. The CILSS, which encompasses Chad, 
  has developed a sub-regional action plan to combat desertification (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>Cameroon and Chad have also developed NEAPs, which provide an overall framework 
  for: improvement of land use; harmonization of land use policies; and environmental 
  management. Implementation of these plans needs strengthening through additional 
  resources and institutional arrangements. In Cameroon, the government has also 
  embarked on a tree-planting programme, aimed at stopping the advancing desert.</p>

            <p>In 1972, the government of Cameroon embarked on a 'Green Revolution', 
              whereby agricultural production and export was promoted, in order 
              to boost the economy.Monocropping was encouraged, in order to increase 
              the production of cacao, coffee, cotton and rubber, which were fetching 
              high prices on the international markets. Fertilizers and pesticides 
              were subsidized (by up to 65 per cent and 100 per cent respectively), 
              which attracted many farmers to this style of input-dependent agriculture.</p>
            <p>However, in 1986, the value of cacao and coffee fell drastically, 
              plunging the country into economic crisis. Subsidies were completely 
              removed, and the use of agrochemicals declined, together with soil 
              fertility. Not only did farmers suffer from lost revenue for their 
              products but, because they had been encouraged to grow crops for 
              export, there was a national deficit of cereal staples. The country 
              had to import food and to request food aid, which has subsequently 
              disrupted local production and food security. For example, imported 
              rice was sold at a lower price than local farmers could produce 
              it,making rice farming unviable.</p>
            <p>Consequently,many farmers abandoned their land and migrated to 
              urban centres, seeking greater income and food security. In 1990, 
              the government embarked on a comprehensive research and development 
              programme to improve food security and land management. The approach 
              was for agricultural extension workers to engage with local farmers, 
              and to develop affordable means of improving productivity, food 
              security and soil fertility. A number of local level projects have 
              been successfully implemented, encouraging farmers to use organic 
              matter, such as animal dung, instead of expensive inorganic fertilizers, 
              and to encourage crop diversification and rotation, and agroforestry. 
              Some farmers have been able to produce sufficient quantities to 
              sell in local markets, and assistance in marketing is provided through 
              the non-governmental organization (NGO) network.</p>
