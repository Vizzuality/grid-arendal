<h2>NORTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>The northern Africa sub-region is dominated by arid conditions and extensive 
  deserts, with the exception of parts of southern Sudan and an intermittent narrow 
  strip along the Mediterranean shoreline, where the climate is more humid. The 
  major issue of concern is, therefore, freshwater availability for domestic, 
  agricultural and industrial consumption. Although most people have access to 
  water resources, as a result of high levels of infrastructure development, demand 
  management and integrated water resources management are priorities for improving 
  adequacy and equity in supply. Water quality is an emerging issue, particularly 
  with regard to salinization from poor irrigation methods, and pollution from 
  industrial and domestic wastewater disposal.</p>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>

<p><a name="fig2e5"></a>The average total annual precipitation in northern Africa 
  is estimated at 1 503 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, equivalent to 7 per cent of the total 
  precipitation for Africa (FAO 1995). Distribution of this precipitation varies 
  dramatically, with almost 75 per cent falling in Sudan (the average is 436 mm/yr, 
  but it ranges from 20 mm/yr in the north to more than 1 600 mm/yr in the south) 
  and just 3 per cent in Egypt (about 18 mm/yr) (FAO 1995). Only 5.6 per cent 
  of the precipitation is available for renewing stream flows and for recharging 
  shallow groundwater aquifers. The rest is mainly lost by evaporation, transpiration 
  and seepage. Per capita water availability ranges from 26 m<sup>3</sup>/yr in 
  Egypt to 1 058 m<sup>3</sup>/yr in Morocco (UNDP and others 2000).</p>
<p>Further disparity is evident when the countries of northern Africa are compared 
  to those in sub-Saharan Africa. The total internal renewable water resources 
  for northern Africa represent 2.5 per cent of the African total, but northern 
  Africa's withdrawals represent 46 per cent of the total African withdrawals. 
  This disparity partially reflects the harsh climatic conditions, and partially 
  indicates an enhanced level of water resources development. It is the effectiveness 
  of such management schemes, and heavy dependence on transboundary supplies, 
  that has facilitated the growth of the sub-region's population and economies.</p>
<p>Renewable groundwater resources are in the form of shallow alluvial aquifers, 
  recharged from the main rivers (for example, the alluvial aquifer beneath the 
  Nile delta in Egypt) or from precipitation (along the north African Mediterranean 
  coast). In the Sahara desert, the major water resources are the combined NSA 
  and the Continental Intercalaire non-renewable aquifer, which extend from Egypt 
  to Mauritania. Current annual rates of groundwater withdrawal in the sub-region 
  are 407 per cent of the recharge rate in Egypt, and 560 per cent in Libya (UNDP 
  and others 2000). Exploitation of groundwater resources over the past ten years 
  has led to a reduction in water pressure levels at the oasis of the western 
  desert. Overextraction from the delta shallow aquifer has led to increased water 
  salinization and a rapid inland advance of the saltwater interface.</p>
<p>The NSA is a huge fossil water resource, located in the eastern Sahara desert 
  in northeastern Africa (see <a href="#fig2e5">Figure 2e.5</a>). It is shared 
  among four countries-Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan-and contains an estimated 
  150 000 km<sup>3</sup> of groundwater (CEDARE 2000). The total current extraction 
  from the NSA is estimated at 1 500 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr. The Centre for 
  Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE) is developing 
  a regional strategy for the sustainable utilization of the aquifer, to be adopted 
  by the four sharing countries. This strategy will consider sustainability of 
  the resource, as well as the development dimension in each country, based on 
  current and future needs.</p>
<p>Global warming and regional climatic change impose an additional possible threat 
  to the already scarce freshwater resources in northern Africa. The Nile basin 
  has a low run-off efficiency index and a high dryness index, rendering it highly 
  susceptible to climate change (IPCC 1998). Run-off is likely to decrease with 
  global warming, even if rainfall increases, because evaporation rates are so 
  high. Scenarios for the future range from a 30 per cent increase in river flow 
  to a 78 per cent decrease in river flow (IPCC 1998), presenting even greater 
  challenges for international cooperation in water resources management. Northern 
  Africa is already frequently affected by cycles of droughts and flooding and, 
  with climate change, these are expected to increase. In the dry lands, which 
  dominate most of the sub-region, population growth will push people onto marginal 
  land, which is highly vulnerable to desertification, thus exacerbating the impacts 
  of climate change. </p>
