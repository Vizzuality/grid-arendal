<h4>Environment</h4>
<p>The environment, as a key driving force for change, is interlinked with other 
  driving forces, and is, at the same time, impacted by other driving forces. 
  Africa faces a series of environmental threats, including: water scarcity; quality 
  and water management issues; land degradation; loss of biodiversity; the rise 
  of infectious diseases; solid waste; degradation of coastal areas; marine pollution; 
  urban air pollution; and climate change. Poverty, as a cause and effect of environmental 
  degradation, has captured significant attention in Africa.</p>

<p>Most basic human needs (food, water and shelter) are linked to the environment. 
  The capacity of the environment to support the demand for food depends both 
  on the intrinsic features of that environment (climate, soils and seasonality) 
  and the extent to which natural constraints on production can be alleviated 
  by management. Demand for food grows both in relation to increasing populations 
  and to changes in lifestyles. Food production is influenced by: the introduction 
  of improved varieties of crops; improved agricultural land management practices; 
  and climate variability. Food security is compromised by droughts and floods, 
  and by the degradation of agricultural lands (declines in fertility, soil loss 
  and salinization) through unsustainable farming practices. Depletion and degradation 
  of the natural resource base intensifies competition for land and natural resources, 
  creating potential conflict and causing human migration to less stressed areas.</p>
<p>Competition for limited resources also arises as demand for those resources 
  exceeds supply. Demand increases both as a result of more people and their domesticates 
  needing access to that resource, and of changes in the patterns of consumption. 
  For example, across much of Africa, water is an increasingly limited resource. 
  This is the result of ongoing degradation of water sources, such as: siltation 
  of dams and rivers; increased demand, due both to increasing numbers of people, 
  and to progressive urbanization and more profligate use of water; and increased 
  demand by the agricultural and emerging industrial sectors. Increased competition 
  for limited water resources has the potential to fuel conflict within countries, 
  among different user groups and between countries sharing a common major water 
  source. Conflicts are also possible between upstream and downstream users in 
  the same watershed.</p>
<p>The African environment has, for several reasons, been healthier than the environments 
  of other continents. For instance, Africa has lower levels of air pollution 
  by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) than all the other continents, and the ozone 
  layer above Africa is in a better state. Furthermore, there are greater levels 
  of biodiversity in Africa than elsewhere. Nevertheless, there are more and more 
  onslaughts on the environment as bushes are increasingly cleared for agricultural 
  development, and as erosion worsens as a result of putting marginal lands to 
  use for mining and agricultural development. African countries remain highly 
  vulnerable to loss of biodiversity and environmental degradation.</p>
