<p>The pressure on biodiversity increases because of the search for raw materials 
  for industries. The pharmaceutical industries develop research on medicinal 
  plants, which are later resold in big markets.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>Biodiversity takes centre stage as a fulcrum for tourism development. The private 
  sector becomes interested in biodiversity conservation as all possible niches 
  are explored for tourism consumption, for example, bird watching, ecotourism 
  and sub-marine tourism. Government identifies the biodiversity hotspots which 
  should be accorded maximum protection, and gazettes them as national parks or 
  strict nature reserves. Deliberate efforts are directed towards rehabilitating 
  degraded ecosystems and restoring species richness. Some ecosystems, however, 
  are subjected to so much pressure that their credibility as areas of significant 
  biodiversity importance is diminished, and is eventually overrun by industrial 
  development or urban settlements. Where this involves protected areas, degazetting 
  procedures are undertaken, involving Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Market Forces scenario, biodiversity is under threat from population 
  growth, urbanization, industrialization, and uncontrolled hunting and fishing. 
  The concentration of new developments along the coasts of the Mediterranean 
  Sea and the Red Sea has adverse impacts on fauna and flora. Desert tourism becomes 
  a very popular theme in North Africa but, without careful regulation, it impacts 
  the biota of this environment. Due to weak law enforcement, illegal trading 
  in rare birds and animal species continues. Conflicts and wars in some countries 
  are also another threat to biodiversity.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa</i></p>
<p>Biodiversity loss in Southern Africa has been a consequence of human development, 
  as species-rich woodlands and forests have been converted to relatively species-poor 
  farmlands and plantations. However, the number of threatened species could be 
  higher, as the full extent of this sub-region's species diversity is not known. 
  There is a serious lack of species inventories and other baseline data, which 
  are useful for monitoring biodiversity trends. While overexploitation of biological 
  resources is acknowledged in the subregion, trends show that there is a greater 
  commitment to conserve wildlife, particularly large mammals. The introduction 
  of community-based natural resource management programmes (CBNRMs) in some countries 
  in the sub-region (for example, CAMPFIRE, Peace Parks, Tchuma Tchato and ADMADE) 
  has seen communities playing a role in the management of biological resources. 
  According to the Market Forces scenario, such trends are certain to continue 
  in the next 30 years, and will be strengthened as the CBNRMs expand their activities 
  to other resources, such as forests and fish.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa</i></p>
<p>Biodiversity remains a major attraction for tourists, and also protects the 
  ecosystem. In an atmosphere where the market is determining progress, competing 
  interests are allowed to promote biodiversity. A number of conservation measures 
  are developed, and are functioning. The government and corporate entities are 
  cooperating, although government has defined its role to one of guidance, whilst 
  the businesses actually implement the measures. In this way, there is little 
  room for destruction of biodiversity as a result of industrial growth.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Progress and maintenance of existing projects are undermined. In the richer 
  countries, some legitimate ecotourism underpins the more commercially appealing 
  projects but, as the quality of tourism declines and as budgets fail, the protected 
  projects become degraded into peep shows. Qualified technical staff migrate, 
  and rare species die off through lack of adequate protection, recorded only 
  on camera and in glass cases as a menagerie alongside the stuffed dodos from 
  Mauritius. Foreign immigration brings with it more alien plant and animal species, 
  which overrun the local delicately balanced ecology. The dying remnants of the 
  rich endemic biodiversity of the region are still to be glimpsed at pre-hunt 
  cocktails in the occasional private parks adjacent to the houses of the rich.</p>
