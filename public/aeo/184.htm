<p><a name="img2f4"></a>Responses to control and to reduce land degradation, erosion 
  and desertification in the sub-region include: the ratification of international 
  agreements; the development and implementation of regional action plans; reform 
  and development of national policies; and effecting local level soil conservation 
  practices. All governments in eastern Africa, except Somalia, have signed and 
  ratified the UNCCD. Uganda, Djibouti and Ethiopia have produced national reports 
  and National Action Plans, and have held awareness-raising meetings. Rwanda, 
  Burundi and Kenya have produced national reports. The Intergovernmental Authority 
  on Development (IGAD) has also produced a sub-regional action plan for the countries 
  in the Horn of Africa (UNCCD 2001).</p>
<p>IGAD was created in 1986 by Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda 
  (and later joined by Eritrea), in order to coordinate development in the Horn 
  of Africa. The IGAD policy on food security and environment aims to establish, 
  amongst other activities: a regional integrated information system for drought 
  monitoring and early warning; diversification of household energy sources; and 
  implementation of the UNCCD. Research activities are also focusing on the promotion 
  of the sustainable production of droughttolerant, high-yielding crop varieties, 
  and capacity building programmes have been established to improve integrated 
  water resources management (IWRM). Efforts to remove barriers to trade and economic 
  growth include the coordination and harmonization of policies in trade, industry, 
  tourism, communications infrastructure and telecommunications.The Ethiopian 
  government has made it a priority to improve food insecurity following the tragic 
  famine of 1983-84, and has been successful in avoiding famine, despite droughts 
  in 1991-92 and 1993-94. This success has been facilitated by: early warning 
  of drought by IGAD; the establishment of an Emergency Food Security Reserve; 
  and substantial assistance from international agencies and donors (FAO 2001c). 
  Vulnerability analysis and mapping by the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme 
  (WFP) has also helped in providing advance information on crop yields. The Ethiopian 
  government is also implementing a Sectoral Investment Programme, focusing on: 
  crop diversification; strengthening early warning; improving access to facilities 
  for the very poor (such as extension services and financial resources); and 
  small-scale irrigation development (FAO 2001c). The capacity of soil and water 
  conservation training institutions is being increased at the various universities 
  and agricultural colleges. The programme is accompanied by a population policy 
  aimed at reducing fertility, in an attempt to address one of the major pressures 
  in land management-population growth (FAO 2001c).</p>
<p>In Uganda, a national land use policy has recently been formulated, although 
  a new law, the Land Act 1998, was enacted two years ago (Moyini 2000). Additionally, 
  the Ugandan government is approaching the population-agriculture issue in three 
  ways. First, in a direct approach, a National Population Policy was formulated 
  in 1995. Second, in an indirect approach, universal primary education was established, 
  in the expectation that a literate population will better appreciate the benefits 
  of family planning (NEMA 1999). Third, the government's Plan for Modernization 
  of Agriculture is expected ultimately to shift the rural population away from 
  subsistence agriculture into agroprocessing industries, leaving few and more 
  efficient farmers (MoFPED/MAAIF 2000).</p>
<p>At the community level, soil management practices in semi-arid eastern Kenya 
  include: strip cropping; intercropping; cover cropping; agroforestry; crop rotation; 
  ridging; mulching and application of manure; terracing; and cutting of drains. 
  National afforestation programmes are also being established as long-term measures 
  to conserve land and soil resources (FAO/AGL 2000).</p>
