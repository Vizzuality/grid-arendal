<h3>POLLUTION OF WESTERN AFRICA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>As Western African economies have diversified and concentrated on exports, 
  sources of industrial pollution have developed in the coastal zone. The main 
  sources are breweries, textile industries, tanneries, aluminium smelting, petroleum 
  processing, and edible oil manufacturing. At present, effluents are often discharged 
  untreated into rivers, lagoons and the coastal waters of the Gulf of Guinea, 
  and this is likely to increase with rising economic pressures to expand industrial 
  operations (Akpabli 2000). The Korle Lagoon, a large coastal wetland in Accra 
  (Ghana), has been severely degraded by pollution from industrial and domestic 
  sources (WRA 1997). Agricultural pollution is widespread, with chemical residues, 
  fertilizers and soil being washed from the surrounding cultivated areas, and 
  causing eutrophication in coastal wetlands and estuaries.</p>
<p>Pollution of such environments reduces their potential to support wildlife 
  and commercial fisheries. Polluted waters are also a risk to human health, through 
  direct contact or contamination of drinking water sources. Pollution by sewage 
  creates a risk of typhoid, paratyphoid, and hepatitis infections, through direct 
  contact and consumption of contaminated seafood. Microbial and bacteriological 
  contamination are cause for concern in the Bay of Hann, near Dakar (Senegal), 
  in Ebrie Lagoon (Abidjan), and in Lagos Lagoon (Nigeria) (UNEP 1984).</p>
<p>Offshore mining and oil drilling activities are major sources of oil pollution, 
  mainly because of leaking pipes, accidents, ballast water discharges, and production-water 
  discharges. Drilling also involves the use of heavy metals such as vanadium 
  and nickel, and contamination of seawater with these metals is known to affect 
  plants and animals. Oil pollution damages coastal resources and habitats, as 
  well as fisheries, reducing catches and incomes.</p>
<h4><a name="enhancing"></a>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality 
  in Western Africa</h4>
<p>The Gulf of Guinea Large Marine Ecosystem Programme is a jointly funded, regional 
  cooperative programme for improving environmental quality and productivity in 
  the Gulf of Guinea (see Box 2c.5). Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and 
  Togo from Western Africa and Cameroon in Central Africa, have participated in 
  the programme which has established a framework for sub-regional cooperation 
  and national level, integrated coastal management plans. It also facilitated 
  the adoption of the Accra Declaration (Declaration for Environmentally Sustainable 
  Development of the Large Marine Ecosystem of the Gulf of Guinea), in 1998. The 
  Declaration, aims at institutionalizing a new ecosystem-wide strategy for joint 
  actions in environmental and natural resource assessment and management in the 
  Gulf of Guinea. Ministers of participating countries have also called for the 
  initiation of a second phase of the project with participation expanded to involve 
  10 other countries from Senegal to Angola. The Programme received recognition 
  by other coastal African nations during the Pan-African Conference on Sustainable 
  Integrated Coastal Management (PACSICOM) (Mozambique, 1998) and by the Advisory 
  Committee on the Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) Conference (South Africa, 1998).</p>
<h5>Towards ICZM in Western Africa</h5>
<p>Western African States signed the Abidjan Convention in 1981. This obligates 
  them to place controls on land and marine-based sources of pollution, to harmonize 
  and strengthen national policies and to cooperate with other countries in the 
  sub-region to enhance environmental management. Parties to the Convention are 
  also required to take steps to control and mitigate coastal erosion and its 
  causes, and to develop contingency plans to prevent and deal with pollution 
  arising from oil exploration and transport activities. Under the Convention, 
  countries are also obliged to conduct environmental impact assessments prior 
  to new developments in the coastal zone as a means of regulating uncoordinated, 
  unplanned developments which could accelerate pollution and erosion. Unfortunately, 
  the Convention was unsuccessful in establishing an effective Regional Coordinating 
  Unit, and progress has been slow. In response, UNEP has established a joint 
  secretariat for the Abidjan and Nairobi Conventions, operational from September 
  2000. The new work programme of the Abidjan Convention countries includes assessments 
  of coastal erosion and activities for improving the management of coastal ecosystems, 
  with a special focus on mangroves and oil pollution.</p>
