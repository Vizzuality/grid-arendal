<h3><a name="img314"></a>DEBT-FOR-NATURE SWAPS </h3>
<p>Pioneered by Kenya in 1988, debt-for-nature swaps (DNS) were aimed at curbing 
  the runaway debt burden of the region. DNS, which involves the cancellation 
  of external debt in exchange for the debtor government's commitment to mobilize 
  domestic resources to fund conservation programmes, were meant to achieve two 
  outcomes at once: to reduce external debt and to enhance environmental management. 
  Between 1987 and 1998, more than 30 developing countries, including some in 
  Africa, had benefited from DNS, which generated US$100 million in funding for 
  the environment (UNSO 1998). According to the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian 
  Office (UNSO), for African countries affected by deforestation, bilateral debt 
  is the most promising source of DNS. This is because, in 1998, commercial debt 
  represented 2 per cent of external debt for these countries and, also, multilateral 
  debt had not been the subject of debt swap transactions. The hope is that since 
  multilateral creditors have accepted the principle that multilateral debt can 
  be written off via the HIPC Initiative, DNS involving multilateral debt could 
  take place. Of the 41 countries which may be eligible for the HIPC Initiative, 
  15 HIPC-eligible countries in Africa are severely affected by desertification 
  (UNSO 1998).</p>
<p>A recent analysis of DNS concluded: 'The debt-for-nature swaps mechanism has 
  been very modestly used until now partly because of the threat it poses on macroeconomic 
  stability of the indebted country, partly because of the complicated dealings 
  involved and finally because of free-riding of northern countries in environmental 
  terms.</p>
<p>'Nevertheless, in its latest version, DNS have become simpler and more significant 
  both in terms of the amount of debt involved and the financial support it provides 
  for environmental projects without inducing macroeconomic instability in the 
  countries involved. Still, DNS has a more important role to play in the environment 
  rather than the debt arena.' (ECLAC 2001)</p>
<p>DNS is only one way of tackling Africa's debt burden, and this has been recognized 
  by African leaders, who want to see the region achieve and sustain an average 
  GDP growth rate of more than 7 per cent a year for the next 15 years (NEPAD 
  2001). One of the goals is to implement national strategies for sustainable 
  development by 2005, in order to reverse the loss of environmental resources 
  by 2015.</p>

<a name="box320"></a>Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS), which were discouraged 
during colonialism, are being revived throughout the region in order to promote 
humannature linkages and to help communities to adapt to their changing environment. 
The Hausa of northern Nigeria, for example, developed a wealth of indigenous knowledge 
to cope with vulnerability to drought and famine in the sub-humid to arid regions 
of the Sahel (Milich 1997). These included: inter-cropping with nitrogen-fixing 
legumes; intensive manure application; soil conservation works; poly-cultural 
production of different cereals to cope with variable soil-moisture regimes; and 
exploiting different ecological niches to support wet and dry season production 
respectively. Other household and communal coping strategies included: wild food 
substitutes; increasing petty trading by women; selling livestock; craft production; 
outmigration to find work; and a strong communal ethic of sharing food with the 
hungry.Pastoralists, such as East Africa's Maasai, exploit the opportunities of 
the natural system by migrating with their flocks to areas where pasturage has 
grown following rain. Other coping tactics include splitting herds to minimize 
risk and setting aside areas as grazing reserves. One important coping strategy 
throughout Africa is 'communal action based on social capital'. In this strategy, 
traditional societies in rural Africa draw on the collective strength of the weak 
to cope with stress in order to decrease vulnerability and insecurity, for example, 
through informal communal institutional processes, such as barter and trade. 
<p>In Southern Africa, for example, various activities have been undertaken to 
  raise awareness among the people. There is a growing realization by governments 
  and civil society that IKS has a lot to offer in natural resource management 
  (Matowanyika 1999). The role of indigenous communities is recognized in Agenda 
  21, which acknowledges their role in developing 'a holistic traditional scientific 
  knowledge of their lands, natural resources and environment' (UN 1992). Advocates 
  of IKS say that the future of the region depends on people acknowledging the 
  important role of their culture in development (see <a href="#box320">Box 3.20</a>).</p>
