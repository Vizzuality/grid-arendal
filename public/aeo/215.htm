<h4>Management of pollution and waste in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>Per capita solid waste generation averages 0.7 kg/day in Zimbabwe, while in 
  Tanzania it is 1 kg/day (Chenje 2000). More people living in urban areas means 
  greater levels of waste generation. As municipalities cannot cope with this, 
  large quantities of solid wastes are not collected, are not treated, or are 
  not disposed of in designated sanitary landfills. On average, less than twothirds 
  of urban households in the sub-region have access to garbage collection services. 
  The situation is most extreme in Lesotho, where only 7 per cent of urban households 
  have garbage collection facilities (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNEP, UNDP & World 
  Bank 1998). As a consequence, large quantities of solid waste are illegally 
  dumped or burned, resulting in increased pollution of both the air and soil. 
  By contrast, Windhoek in Namibia recycles 4.5 per cent of waste, 3 per cent 
  is incinerated, and the rest is disposed of in sanitary landfill (UNCHS 2001c). 
  In Gaborone (Botswana) and Maputo (Mozambique) nearly all solid waste is disposed 
  of in an open dump rather than a sanitary landfill (UNCHS 2001c). This gives 
  rise to unhygienic conditions where the proliferation of disease vectors is 
  facilitated, and risks of surface and groundwater contamination are high. Methane 
  emissions may also be dangerous to nearby residents and contribute to atmospheric 
  pollution and global climate change.</p>

<p>The major constraint on proper management of solid waste in cities of Southern 
  Africa is inadequate finance (UNCHS 1996). Privatization of waste collection 
  services has been encouraged by structural adjustment programmes in an attempt 
  to raise additional funds (see <a href="#box2g4">Box 2g.4</a>). Unfortunately, 
  this has, to an extent, worsened the problem of improper waste dumping, as companies 
  sometimes avoid using designated dumping sites where they are supposed to pay 
  a fee. </p>

            <p>In Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) less than three per cent of the city's 
              solid waste is collected due to lack of appropriate vehicles and 
              inadequate cost recovery (UNCHS & UNEP 1997). As part of a new Environmental 
              Planning and Management Process, waste management services have 
              been privatised, an emergency clean up operation was launched, and 
              management of disposal sites has improved. New City Council bylaws 
              were introduced to facilitate collection of revenues and innovative 
              fiscal incentives for rehabilitating the fleet of vehicles were 
              also established.</p>

<p><a name="box2g4"></a>The slow pace of development of urban infrastructure in 
  Southern Africa has resulted in increasing traffic congestion throughout the 
  sub-region, with central business districts of most major cities having inadequate 
  public transport networks and parking space. However, the sub-region has also 
  witnessed a significant rise in the number of cars, currently translating as 
  51 persons per car (WRI, UNEP, UNDP & World Bank 1998) compared to 197 persons 
  per car 20 years ago (WRI, UNEP & UNDP 1992). The advanced age of most of the 
  vehicles, and heavy dependence on leaded fuel and diesel contribute to high 
  levels of smog and particularly lead pollution.</p>
<p>Other urban sources of air pollution include industrial emissions and smoke 
  arising from domestic consumption of coal, wood, and charcoal. Human health 
  impacts include elevated incidence of acute respiratory infections such as asthma 
  and bronchitis. Buildings are corroded and surrounding plant communities are 
  subjected to toxic pollutants.</p>
<p>Most cities in the sub-region have established air quality standards and have 
  monitoring programmes in place. In South Africa, where the problem is greatest 
  because of the highest density of industries and vehicles, an Atmospheric Pollution 
  Prevention Act (1965) stipulates the latest technologies to be used in controlling 
  noxious and offensive emissions. The same act, which is being updated, makes 
  provision for control of smoke from industrial operations by establishing grounds 
  for prosecution of offenders, and empowers the Minister of Transport to make 
  regulations regarding the exhaust emissions from vehicles operating on public 
  roads. However, enforcement of this regulation is weak owing to lack of resources 
  for monitoring and prosecution. Some municipalities (including Cape Town and 
  Durban) also have bylaws preventing the burning of refuse, but again, these 
  are not always adhered to.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>In addition to the specific responses listed above, a number of policies and 
  strategies have been put in place at national level. In Malawi, a national housing 
  policy has been developed, while in South Africa an urban development strategy 
  was recently launched for discussion. In Zimbabwe, a policy of decentralization 
  encourages the development of rural service centres, commonly known as growth 
  points, to relieve the pressures of population and pollution on major urban 
  centres. However, the policy has not met with much success, as the service centres 
  continue to be shunned by many, probably because of the complexity of push and 
  pull factors that contribute to urban growth rates.</p>
<p>Legislation requiring environmental impact assessment prior to development 
  is another recent feature in most Southern African municipalities, and local 
  development plans taking into consideration the priorities for integrated environmentally-sensitive 
  and socially-acceptable development have been widely adopted. Maseru (Lesotho), 
  Lilongwe (Malawi), Maputo (Mozambique), Windhoek (Namibia), East Rand (South 
  Africa), Bulawayo, Chegutu, Gweru, Harare and Mutare (Zimbabwe) have all put 
  in place local environmental plans and implemented them to some extent (UNCHS 
  2001c). The City of Cape Town approved an Integrated Metropolitan Management 
  Policy in 2001 and implementation of a number of strategies for tackling air 
  pollution, litter and illegal dumping, and for creating open space and managing 
  environmental education has begun (City of Cape Town 2001). Funding is still 
  the major restriction for many municipalities, and alternative strategies are 
  required to boost local authorities' capacities.</p>
