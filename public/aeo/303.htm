  Africa</i></p>
<p>Water resources have become inadequate in quantity and quality in Africa, mainly 
  because of poor management resulting from chaotic circumstances dominating the 
  region. Although there is abundant water supply in Africa, there are sub-regions 
  and countries which have water scarcity. Water inadequacy results in poor health, 
  low productivity and food insecurity, and constrains economic growth. In the 
  Fortress World scenario, the vast majority of African countries fail to conserve 
  and protect water as a valuable, but vulnerable, resource.</p>
<p>As a result of increased poverty, access to water and sanitation has been in 
  increasing decline in Africa. This, in turn, causes high incidents of communicable 
  diseases, which diminish and hinder economic development. The result is less 
  investment in developing water resources which, in turn, leads to reduced water 
  availability-a vicious spiral between cause and effect. With the crises of endemic 
  poverty and pervasive underdevelopment, water in Africa has been subject to 
  inefficient, inequitable and unsustainable use. The élite ensured abundant share 
  of available water resources, while the poor majority suffered central role 
  in managing and safeguarding water. Water continues to be underused in energy 
  generation as the hydropower generation infrastructure collapses, due to poor 
  maintenance and lack of resources for modernization.</p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the infrastructure for the management of water 
  resources deteriorates, with inadequate institutional and financial arrangements, 
  lack of data and weak human capacity. Problems with water and land further aggravate 
  food problems. Groundwater, especially in shallow aquifers, is highly degraded 
  and depleted, a situation which becomes severe in Northern Africa, where there 
  are very few renewable water resources. Water interdependency is high in Africa. 
  Nevertheless, regional cooperation on transboundary water issues is not only 
  weakened further, but is strained by escalating tensions and conflicts, as openness 
  and transparency are eroded.</p>

  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>Certain rural areas (northern Cameroon, northern Central Africa, Chad) are 
  already suffering from lack of access to potable water and water supply. In 
  the Fortress World scenario, this phenomenon becomes more pronounced, with the 
  advent of desert encroachment due to deforestation. As far as agriculture is 
  concerned, production is reduced and conflicts worsen due to water resource 
  issues, with conflicts between breeders and agriculturists, and between élites 
  and indigenous populations (who either own the resources or who do not have 
  access to adequate means of production). In view of the lack of sewage water 
  recycling, high population growth and an obsolete hydraulic (sewage water) system, 
  urban areas experience shortages in potable water, and there is an upsurge in 
  water-borne diseases.</p>

  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>If the unequitable allocation of natural resources per capita is the symptom 
  of the Fortress World scenario, it is specifically apparent in the case of valuable 
  resources, such as land and water. The industry-driven élite control most of 
  the freshwater resources, whilst leaving marginal water resources to the poor 
  majority. Being industrydriven, the élite allocate more water to the industrial 
  sector, depriving irrigated agriculture of a much-needed vital input. However, 
  the improper management of water with different qualities has an impact, with 
  increased pollution and degradation of many sources of surface water and groundwater. 
  The élite are not concerned with the problem, because they use desalinated water 
  for supplying their domestic needs.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the water supply situation continues to be 
  precarious for most countries in this sub-region. The situation is particularly 
  bad for South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi, resulting in drastically reduced 
  agricultural outputs. Even with transboundary initiatives, water demand management 
  and water recycling, supply does not meet demand. Conflicts between water users 
  emerge, with disadvantaged groups, such as women and the elderly, being the 
  losers in the competition for the resource. Water-borne diseases, which had 
  hitherto been under control, emerge once more.</p>

  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>Concerned only about their individual and family comfort, the élites in the 
  fortress world appear to be satisfied with meeting their direct freshwater needs. 
  Once these needs are met, they pay little heed to problems affecting the rest 
  of society. Only when an epidemic breaks out, which denies them the labour of 
  their farmworkers, do they develop ways and means of managing freshwater resources.</p>

  West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, pollution, and the destruction of dams and 
  smaller water storage systems, pipes and pumps in civil strife, create continual 
  water shortages and drought throughout this sub-region, with a devastating impact 
  on animal and human life.</p>
