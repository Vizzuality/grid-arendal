<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>

<p>The contribution of the Western Indian Ocean Islands to global climate change 
  is small (less than half of one per cent of Africa's total carbon dioxide emissions 
  in 1996), but vulnerability to the impacts of change is high, as is the case 
  for other Small Island Developing States (African Development Bank 2001).</p>
<p>Seychelles has the highest per capita emission rate for carbon dioxide emissions 
  in the sub-region (2.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per inhabitant per year in 1996), 
  but the country's natural capacity for removal of the gas from the atmosphere 
  is estimated to be four times higher than the levels it emits (African Development 
  Bank 2001, UNDP 2000).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Energy production and industry are important sources of GHGs and commercial 
  energy consumption is increasing in Madagascar by 1.6 per cent per year and 
  in Mauritius by 2.6 per cent per year. Per capita consumption of electricity 
  has more than doubled in Mauritius and Seychelles since 1984, while in Comoros 
  and Madagascar it has remained constant or fallen. Between 1991 and 1995, total 
  carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes increased by 5 per cent in 
  Madagascar and by 23 per cent in Mauritius (UNEP 1999).</p>

<p>The sub-region is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of global climate 
  change because of its low lying flat lands, narrow coastal strips, atolls, reefs 
  and sandy beaches, and the concentration of human populations, tourism, infrastructure, 
  transport and industrial activities in coastal zones (Leatherman 1997). It is 
  estimated that a one-metre rise in sea level would submerge most of the Seychelles 
  islands with a loss of 70 per cent of their land area (Shah 1995, Shah 1996). 
  The same rise would result in a loss of 5 km<sup>2</sup> of land in Mauritius, 
  0.3 per cent of its surface area (IPCC 1995). For the sub-region as a whole, 
  it has been estimated that, in total, 22 per cent of the population of the islands 
  would be at risk from ocean rises and that rises would affect fishing and tourism, 
  and jeopardize economic viability.</p>
<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in the Western Indian 
  Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>Responses to climate variability and climate change include ratification of 
  the UNFCCC and, in the case of Seychelles, the Kyoto Protocol. This has been 
  supported at the national level by the development of National Communications 
  Strategies, as well as National Environment Action Plans. Mauritius has also 
  undertaken studies of GHG sources and sinks.</p>
<p>The Western Indian Ocean Marine Applications Programme is a regional branch 
  of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), a permanent global system for observation, 
  modelling and analysis of marine and ocean variables to support operational 
  ocean services world-wide. The GOOS provides information on the current state 
  of the oceans and forecasts on future conditions as the basis for climate change 
  modelling.</p>
<p>In May 1991, the Mauritius Meteorological Services established a National Climate 
  Committee (NCC) involving all parties with an interest in climate change. The 
  Committee was tasked with monitoring progress on the scientific understanding 
  of climate change, and evaluating the possible economic impacts on agriculture, 
  coastal zones, energy and water resources, and human health and welfare.</p>
