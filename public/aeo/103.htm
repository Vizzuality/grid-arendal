<h4>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality in Northern Africa </h4>
<p>The most significant response from governments in Northern Africa to combat 
  pollution of all types has been the establishment of the organization for the 
  Protection of the Environment in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA). The 
  purpose and achievements of PERSGA are detailed in <a href="#box2c1">Box 2c.1</a>. 
  Based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, its main function is to implement the Regional 
  Convention for the Conservation of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Environment 
  (Jeddah Convention).</p>

            <p>Recognizing the need for international cooperation in marine and 
              coastal management in Northern Africa, an interdisciplinary research 
              programme for the Red Sea was initiated, in 1974, under the auspices 
              of the UNEP Regional Seas Programme. Following from this, an Action 
              Plan for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden was approved (1976). In 1982, 
              the Jeddah Convention for the Conservation of the Red Sea and Gulf 
              of Aden Environment was signed, along with the Protocol for Regional 
              Cooperation in Combating Pollution by Oil and Other Harmful Substances 
              in Cases of Emergency. Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi 
              Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen are parties to the Convention. 
              In 1995, the Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment 
              of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA) was formally established 
              to implement the objectives of the Convention and its protocol. 
              Achievements to date include environmental assessments of the coast 
              and surveys of natural habitat, collection of oceanographic data, 
              impact assessments of shrimp and pearl industries, training workshops 
              in combating oil pollution, environmental impact assessments, ICZM, 
              and establishment of a marine national park. Publications include 
              state of the environment reports, directories of capacities and 
              legislation and an assessment of the land-based sources and activities 
              affecting the marine and coastal environment.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) was adopted in Barcelona, Spain, in 1975, 
  by 16 Mediterranean States and the European Community, under the auspices of 
  UNEP and within the framework of its Regional Seas Programme. The aim of MAP 
  is to protect the environment while encouraging sustainable development in the 
  Mediterranean Basin. It has six associated protocols covering coastal zone management, 
  pollution assessment and control, protection of ecosystems and preservation 
  of biodiversity. MAP was revised in 1995 to become more action-oriented and 
  an instrument for sustainable development. Activities to date include gathering 
  of pollution-trend data and compliance monitoring, the establishment of a list 
  of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance and related programmes 
  for protection and conservation of species, and regulation of the introduction 
  of non-indigenous or genetically modified species. The MAP Coastal Areas Management 
  Programme is a mechanism for enhancing cooperation between national and local 
  authorities and institutions-13 projects have been implemented since 1989. A 
  Mediterranean Environment and Development Observatory has also been established 
  to provide information to support decision making (UNEP 2001).</p>
<p>There are two Marine Protected Areas (MPA) along the Gulf of Aqaba, and there 
  is a proposal for additional protected areas. In the northern Red Sea, there 
  are three MPAs which need support through further strengthening of regulations, 
  and proposals for new protected areas. There is only one protected area in the 
  Dahlak Islands (in the south-eastern Red Sea), recognized as forming unique 
  habitats that are under increasing pressure from tourism and oil transportation. 
  There are 14 coastal protected areas and 5 marine areas along the Mediterranean 
  coast of Northern Africa. There are no MPAs in the Gulf of Suez and the only 
  one proposed covers only a portion at the southern end of the Gulf. There are 
  proposals for a much wider network of protected areas all along the coast. Overall, 
  the standards of protection on both the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts are 
  below those afforded by protected area mechanisms. In line with the shifting 
  paradigm of environmental management-away from protection and towards responsible 
  and sustainable development- Egypt Morocco and Tunisia have taken steps to develop 
  and implement ICZM plans. However, as these are recent measures, few conclusive 
  studies have been undertaken to measure their progress.</p>
