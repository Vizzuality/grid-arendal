<h5>Towards ICZM in Africa </h5>
<p>During the last decade, the international community has recognized the intensity 
  and complexity of pressures on coastal and marine environments and has demonstrated 
  a commitment to more integrated management. An important step in this direction 
  was the 1995 Washington Declaration in which 110 government recognized the importance 
  of integrated management of coastal zones and adopted the Global Programme of 
  Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities 
  (GPA).</p>
<p>UNEP was tasked with coordination of the GPA which is designed as a global 
  framework and source of practical guidance for devising and implementing sustained 
  action to prevent, reduce, control and/or eliminate marine degradation from 
  land-based activities. Specific aims of the GPA are to identify and assess problems 
  relating to the coastal and marine environments, establish priorities for action, 
  set management objectives for tackling these priority issues, develop strategies 
  to achieve these objectives, and evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. 
  The GPA will be implemented through UNEP's Regional Seas Programme which provides 
  support to regions in implementing its objectives and in building capacity for 
  sustained implementation.</p>
<p>The Regional Seas Programme was initiated by UNEP in 1974 and has been repeatedly 
  endorsed as a regional approach to the control of marine pollution and the management 
  of marine and coastal resources. In Africa, there are Regional Seas Programmes 
  for Eastern Africa (encompassing Comoros, France (La Reunion), Kenya, Madagascar, 
  Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia and the United Republic of Tanzania), 
  the Mediterranean (encompassing the African states of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, 
  Morocco, and Tunisia, as well as many European states) the Red Sea and Gulf 
  of Aden (encompassing the African states of Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia), and 
  for Western and Central Africa (encompassing Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, 
  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, 
  Liberia, Mauritania, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra 
  Leone, Togo and Congo). Action plans have been developed under each of these 
  programmes, as well as conventions and protocols for implementation of regional 
  objectives at the national level.</p>
<p>Many African governments have realized the benefits of ICZM and have enacted 
  policies and legislation to put its principles into effect. However, sustained 
  resourcing (i.e. financial support, equipment, training of personnel, and monitoring 
  of activities) is required to achieve maximum benefits to the coastal and marine 
  environments and the economies that depend on them.</p>
