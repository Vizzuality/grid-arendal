<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>The African coastline has abundant and diverse natural resources and highly 
  productive ecosystems that provide protection and stabilization of the physical 
  coastline, regulation of global atmospheric gases, and nutrient cycling. The 
  natural beauty of the coastline and its abundant resources have attracted high 
  numbers of tourists and migrants in recent years. Local communities are heavily 
  dependent on coastal resources such as mangrove trees for construction and medicinal 
  and food products, and for subsistence or small-scale trade. Inland communities 
  are now also able to access these resources and demand, as well as the price, 
  for some food species is sufficient to support national fishing industries. 
  These fisheries and other industries (notably oil and gas, and tourism) make 
  substantial contributions to the national economies of coastal African countries. 
  The coastal and marine resources therefore have great ecological, social and 
  economic importance, both locally and for the global community.</p>
<p>Abundance of natural resources and economic opportunities have led to very 
  high rates of migration and urbanization, tourism, and development in Africa 
  over the past 30 years. Housing and urban infrastructure, industrial sites, 
  ports, agricultural activities and hotel and leisure facilities have all also 
  developed and have brought with them activities such as mining of sand, limestone 
  and coral to provide building materials. These pressures have combined to destabilize 
  Africa's coastal zone, increase erosion, smother habitats, deplete resources, 
  pollute ecosystems, and reduce biodiversity. The consequence of these impacts 
  has been a drop in economic opportunities and increasing poverty amongst coastal 
  communities dependent on natural resources. Pollution levels are also threatening 
  human health, directly through exposure to contaminants in coastal waters at 
  popular resorts, and indirectly through accumulation of toxins in seafood. This 
  pattern of overextraction and overloading with wastes is likely to continue, 
  if not intensify, in future.</p>
<p>The challenge for Africa is to use its resources wisely, so that economic development 
  can be achieved without destroying the resource base on which it is founded. 
  ICZM is a proposed tool for doing this, and one that has been adopted, in principle, 
  by many coastal African nations. However, implementation in many countries has 
  been hampered by lack of human and financial resources, lack of scientific data 
  and monitoring programmes, and by institutional fragmentation and lack of cooperative 
  mechanisms and integrated development models. Similarly, international treaties, 
  such as the United Nations Law of the Sea, and MARPOL, have been signed but 
  are ineffective without the necessary commitment to ensure implementation and 
  enforcement of penalties for non-compliance.</p>
