<a name="img2a7"></a>Although GHG emissions for Southern Africa are generally 
low, emissions of toxic air pollutants, especially in urban centres, are cause 
for concern. Examples include the heavy metals mercury and lead, synthetic chemicals 
such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic organic matter (POM), dioxins 
and benzene. These pollutants arise from industrial and domestic sources and from 
use of vehicles and because Southern Africa lacks affordable cleaner technologies 
and fuel sources. Weather conditions in cities in the sub-region also aggravate 
the levels of pollution observed so that air pollution levels observed in certain 
cities in winter exceed WHO levels (Chenje & Johnson 1994).
<p>Traditional fuels also cause pollution problems. For example, a study in Tanzania 
  found that children under five who died of acute respiratory infections were 
  almost three times more likely to have been exposed to burning of traditional 
  fuels in the home than healthy children in the same age group (World Bank 2000b).</p>
<p>In South Africa, sulphur dioxide emissions from power stations travel significant 
  distances and acidification of water and forests has been recorded in the north-eastern 
  part of the country.</p>
<h4>Towards improving air quality in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>Actions to improve air quality in Southern Africa include air quality monitoring 
  and establishment of air quality guidelines, as well as requirements for environmental 
  impact assessments to be made for any new development with potentially damaging 
  effects on air quality. Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe have air pollution 
  legislation, although it is enforced to varying degrees, being limited by lack 
  of resources. Tanzania's National Environment Management Council commissioned 
  a study of air quality in Dar es Salaam, to assess emissions from traffic as 
  well as noise pollution, sulphur dioxide levels, and particulate concentrations, 
  measured against national and international standards. The purpose of the study 
  was to find ways of reducing emissions and improve transport systems. In August 
  2000, the United Nations Motor Vehicle Emissions Agreement came into force, 
  to develop globally uniform regulations, promoting energy efficiency and vehicle 
  safety. South Africa was the first country to sign this agreement, other Southern 
  African countries are encouraged to follow suit.</p>
