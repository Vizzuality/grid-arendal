<p>As a result of these pressures, a significant number of plant and animal species 
  in the Western Indian Ocean Islands are threatened with extinction or have become 
  extinct-the most notorious case being that of the Dodo of which the demise is 
  attributed to overhunting and the introduction of alien species. Throughout 
  the Western Indian Ocean Islands, populations of endangered marine species such 
  as the Green Turtle, the Hawksbill Turtle, the Coelacanth and the Dugong have 
  declined in recent years. In Mauritius 62 animal species-mainly birds, reptiles 
  and a large number of molluscs-have become extinct and several species now only 
  survive in small populations under protection schemes. Mauritius and Seychelles 
  are ranked second and third in the world in terms of the percentage of native 
  plants threatened (UNEP 1999). The numbers of threatened species in the sub-region 
  are given in <a href="#tab2b8">Table 2b.8</a>.</p>

<p>In response to the threats to natural habitats in the Western Indian Ocean 
  Islands, protected areas have been established inland and in the coastal and 
  marine zones. In 1999, there were: 1 reserve in Comoros; 44 protected areas 
  covering 2.9 per cent of the land area in Madagascar; 18 reserves covering 3.7 
  per cent of the land area in Mauritius; and 26 sites covering 47 per cent of 
  the land area in Seychelles (UNEP 1999). The Andringitra Reserve, newly created 
  in Madagascar with the assistance of WWF, is thought to be one of the world's 
  most biologically rich areas, and to be most representative of the island. The 
  Andohahela National Park, Bexa Mahafaly Special Reserve and Lac Tsimanampetsotsa 
  are areas designated as reserves with the specific aim of protecting the dry 
  forest and spiny thicket habitats which are unique to Madagascar.</p>
<p>The sub-region also has two Biosphere Reserves in Madagascar and one in Mauritius, 
  three World Heritage sites (two in Seychelles and one in Madagascar), and four 
  Ramsar sites (one in Comoros, two in Madagascar, and one in Mauritius) (Ramsar 
  2002, UNESCO 2002, UNEP 1999). Mauritius has also signed the Ramsar Convention, 
  but has not yet designated a site. All of the Western Indian Ocean Islands are 
  parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and efforts are underway 
  to develop a conceptual framework for coral reef conservation. The Indian Ocean 
  Commission has initiated a regional project with a view to achieving sustainable 
  management of natural resources. This aims to protect resources and integrate 
  management in the coastal zone, and to protect and conserve endangered endemic 
  flora.</p>
<p>More than 20 endangered species in the Western Indian Ocean Islands, are protected 
  by official programmes within national protected areas. Madagascar has 10 programmes 
  for conservation of species in protected areas and there are 8 in Mauritius 
  and 3 in Seychelles. Particular success has been achieved in the Seychelles 
  with the protection of the Aldabra Tortoise through an Australasian Species 
  Management Programme-there are now 155 000 specimens in the wild. In Mauritius, 
  the Pink Pigeon has been successfully conserved through a Jersey Wildlife Preservation 
  Trust project and some 300 are now surviving in the wild. In Seychelles, populations 
  of the Brush Warbler, a species that was critically threatened, have grown to 
  250 and, in Mauritius, the Rodrigues Flying Fox has successfully recovered under 
  the North American Species Survival Plan. There are now 350 flying foxes surviving 
  in the wild (UNEP 1999).</p>
<p>Eradication of introduced problem predators such as rats, mice and macaques 
  has been achieved in some of the smaller islands, by means including poison 
  pellets, wax blocks, and trapping. Infestations of alien plants are being controlled 
  within conservation management areas by manual weeding and by erecting barriers 
  to pigs and other animals that may disperse the seeds. Airports and seaports 
  are also carefully monitored and incoming traffic is sprayed with insecticides 
  and herbicides to reduce the risk of accidental introductions. There are also 
  strict regulations on animal and plant products entering the country. Reducing 
  populations to manageable levels will, however, take a long time and will require 
  considerable resources.</p>
<p>All of the West Indian Ocean Islands have ratified the CITES, and Madagascar, 
  Mauritius and Seychelles have established Management and Scientific Authorities 
  to regulate the granting of import and export permits. National programmes have 
  also been established to encourage sustainable use and trade in certain wildlife 
  products (including shells, turtle products, seabirds and their eggs, and certain 
  plants), but these frequently suffer from insufficient resources to properly 
  implement the restrictions. A major subregion- wide policy giving highest priority 
  to conservation of endangered species is an immediate requirement. Alternative 
  strategies to individual species conservation programmes and creation of protected 
  areas are also required. Local communities and national economies need alternative 
  resources or means of support, and a culture of sustainable harvesting needs 
  to be implemented.</p>
