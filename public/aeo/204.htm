<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>Urban centres, and cities in particular, have developed from administrative 
  and transport centres to commercial hubs, and centres of education and technology, 
  manufacturing and processing, trade, and employment. Urban dwellers have lifestyles 
  that contrast starkly with those of their rural forebears or contemporaries, 
  not least in their interactions with the environment. In the majority of nations, 
  cities generate the lion's share of economic activity, ultimately consume most 
  of the natural resources, and produce most of the pollution and waste. These 
  problems are usually associated with unplanned or unserviced settlements (slums) 
  where predominantly poor inhabitants do not have access to adequate housing, 
  water supply, sanitation, waste disposal, or electricity. These are also highly 
  visible impacts and affect the health and well-being of many millions of people. 
  However, environmental degradation is caused as much by the excessive consumption 
  of resources (especially water) and generation of non-biodegradable wastes prevalent 
  in affluent urban areas as it is by illegal dumping and burning of sewage and 
  solid wastes in informal settlements (e.g. Napier 2000). The key requirements 
  for sustainable urban growth are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> coherent, integrated planning; </li>
  <li>development that is environmentally and socially sensitive; </li>
  <li>security of tenure and financing; </li>
  <li>sufficient investment in infrastructure to keep pace with the rate of growth 
    of urban populations and their demands for adequate shelter, services, and 
    security; </li>
  <li>integrated and innovative demand management with respect to resources and 
    services; and </li>
  <li>rural development programmes to assist in slowing the rate of urban population 
    growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>The high rate of growth of urban populations in Africa has resulted partially 
  from an increase in the number of urban households, brought about by changes 
  in standards of living and attitudes towards familial dependence. The rate of 
  growth in number of households across Africa averaged 3.1 per cent between 1985 
  and 2000, and is set to continue at this rate until 2030 (UNCHS 2001a). The 
  consequent increase in demand for basic housing and services for urban populations, 
  as well as skewed distribution of investment towards affluent suburban developments, 
  has resulted in the rapid expansion of illegal or unplanned and unserviced settlements, 
  with unhealthy living conditions and extreme overcrowding. For example, in 1993, 
  about 55 per cent of Nairobi's population lived in informal settlements (USAID 
  1993), and in South Africa, nearly half the population did not have adequate 
  housing in the late 1990s (DEA&T 1999). In Monrovia, Liberia, 42 per cent of 
  households were reportedly living as squatters in 1998 (UNCHS 2001c). Furthermore, 
  only 60 per cent of urban dwellings in Africa are considered permanent, and 
  almost half fall short of compliance with regulations (UNCHS 2001b). In African 
  cities the average person has just 8 square metres of floor space, indicating 
  conditions of extreme overcrowding. By comparison, residents of Asian cities 
  have 9.5 m<sup>2</sup>, in industrialized countries the average is 34.5 m<sup>2</sup>, 
  and the global average is 13.6 m<sup>2</sup> (UNCHS 2001b). Overcrowding exacerbates 
  rates of transmission of infectious diseases, such as gastro-intestinal infections, 
  and respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, commonly associated with poor 
  ventilation and air pollution.</p>

<p>Low revenue in African municipalities, and consequently low spending, has led 
  to development and maintenance of infrastructure being severely curtailed. In 
  spite of their contribution to national economies, African municipalities receive 
  only 14 per cent of GDP in revenue-an average of US$14 per capita per year and 
  two hundred times less than the revenue of municipalities of high income countries 
  (UNCHS 2001b). They spend only US$12 per capita per year. This situation has 
  been further compounded by slow economic growth over the past three decades 
  and a bias amongst donor organizations in favour of development projects in 
  rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="fig2g2"></a>An additional concern is that the poor often pay higher 
  prices for housing and associated services. In African cities, people spend 
  approximately 40 per cent of their incomes on rent, with the Arab nations paying 
  the most at 45 per cent. This is over twice the amount paid by residents of 
  higher income countries and indicates the high demand for housing and slow rates 
  of provision of rented accommodation in Africa (UNCHS 2001b). Local governments 
  are attempting to address this issue by increasing the production of low-cost 
  housing stocks, and introducing housing subsidies for low-income groups (Department 
  of Housing 2000, UNCHS 2000). However, tremendous backlogs still exist, as housing 
  development falls short of population growth and urbanization rates. The residents 
  of informal urban settlements often pay more for access to water (see <a href="#fig2g2">Figure 
  2g.2</a>), whereas water rates to planned suburban developments and industrial 
  and agricultural users can be heavily subsidized (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
<p>Access to water supply, sewerage, electricity and telephone in African cities 
  ranks the lowest in the world (UNCHS 2001b). Overall access to improved water 
  sources in urban areas in Africa has increased marginally, from 84 per cent 
  in 1990 to 85 per cent in 2000. However, 'improved water' includes household 
  connection, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells or springs, and 
  rainwater collection (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Similarly 'improved sanitation' includes 
  connection to a public sewer or septic system, a pour-flush toilet, a simple 
  pit latrine, or a ventilated pit latrine (WHO/UNICEF 2000). The overall figure 
  for access to sanitation in African towns and cities declined marginally from 
  85 to 84 per cent in the same period (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Poor water supply and 
  sanitation create conditions conducive to high rates of waterrelated diseases 
  such as cholera, dysentery, scabies, and eye infections. Diarrhoea and dysentery 
  are among the most prevalent childhood diseases and a significant cause of under-five 
  mortality. They correlate strongly with lack of availability of clean water 
  (UNCHS 2001b). In addition, health and education facilities in unplanned settlements 
  are often under-resourced or unaffordable, and unemployment and poverty are 
  rife.</p>
<p>Unplanned settlements can, however, also be important economic centres, contributing 
  to the informal economy through provision of services such as food provision 
  and sale, domestic services, car and household maintenance, hairdressing, and 
  childminding, as well as trade and recycling (e.g. Napier, Ballance & Macozoma 
  2000). A good example of the contribution of the informal sector is the 'Zaballeen', 
  a group of informal waste collectors in Egypt who separate and recycle different 
  types of waste, thereby providing a valuable service to the urban environment 
  whilst also making a living (UNCHS 1999).</p>
<p>Environmental impacts of rapid, unplanned, urban growth include loss of natural 
  habitats, changes in and sometimes loss of biodiversity, as well as alterations 
  to ecological functions such as hydrological cycles and atmospheric exchange. 
  Fragile environments such as delicate slopes, natural drainage waterways, and 
  floodprone areas, are at risk from rapid urbanization. In unplanned settlements-where 
  space is at a premium and shelters are erected on steep slopes, on wetlands, 
  or in flood zones-not only are residents at risk from flooding and subsidence, 
  but the ecosystems are also vulnerable to pollution and physical degradation. 
  Residents of Johannesburg's Alexandra Township were devastated by flooding and 
  suffered loss of property and outbreaks of cholera in early 2000. In Cairo, 
  the risk of earthquake puts millions of people in dense and insufficiently stable 
  urban settlements in danger of loss of life and property. Improved planning, 
  reductions in the backlog of low-cost housing, and improved disaster early warning 
  and preparedness schemes are required to reduce this threat.</p>
