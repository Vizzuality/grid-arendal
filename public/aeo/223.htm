<p>Africa is endowed with rich and diverse biological resources. These have enormous 
  value for indigenous populations, commercial enterprises, and for development 
  of tourism. These resources are, however, declining rapidly under the pressures 
  of habitat loss, overharvesting of selected species, the spread of alien species, 
  and illegal activities. In Western and Central Africa the main issues are loss 
  and fragmentation of forest habitat and poaching of endangered species to meet 
  the growing demand for bushmeat. In Eastern Africa, encroachment of human settlements 
  into protected areas and pastoral areas outside of reserves and their cultivation 
  are priority concerns. In Southern Africa, loss of indigenous knowledge and 
  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights are hampering conservation 
  measures, as are overharvesting (legal and illegal) of medicinal plant species, 
  rare and endangered plants, and "trophy" animals and exotic pets. Overharvesting 
  of certain species, particularly medicinal plants is also the primary cause 
  of biodiversity loss in Northern Africa. Alien invasive organisms are a widespread 
  problem throughout the region, particularly in closed ecosystems including Lake 
  Victoria and the Western Indian Ocean Islands.Formal protection of Africa's 
  biodiversity at both national and international levels has been strengthened 
  over the past 30 years, but the paradigm of conservation is now shifting away 
  from protection and preservation and focussing more on sustainable use and sharing 
  of benefits. If this is to be achieved in Africa, wider involvement of stakeholders 
  is required, together with additional research and documentation. Biological 
  resources can and should be used to enhance economic growth opportunities, but 
  consumptive and non-consumptive uses need to be managed with a long-term rather 
  than a short-term view, and a fair and protective framework needs to be established 
  to ensure that the benefits of resource use accrue to African communities and 
  nations, rather than to international companies. <a href="#fig2s2">Figure 2s.2</a> 
  summarizes the main threats to Africa's biodiversity.</p>
