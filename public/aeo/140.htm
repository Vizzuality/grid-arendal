<h2><a name="img2d6"></a>CENTRAL AFRICA</h2>
<p>Central Africa's high and reliable rainfall supports extensive forest cover 
  throughout the sub-region, with the exceptions of the northern part of Cameroon, 
  Chad and the Central African Republic. Forests and woodlands cover, in total, 
  about 45 per cent of the land area of Central Africa, and constitute 37 per 
  cent of Africa's total forest cover (FAO 2001a). Most countries in the sub-region 
  are therefore well endowed with forests, with Gabon having the greatest cover 
  (85 per cent), and Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and 
  Equatorial Guinea having over 50 per cent. The exception is Chad, which, because 
  of its northerly location and arid environment, has only 10 per cent forest 
  cover (FAO 2001a). Tropical forests are the predominant type in the sub-region, 
  namely lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforest, montane forests, freshwater swamp 
  forests. Savanna cover is also significant in the northern parts of Cameroon, 
  Central African Republic, and Chad and southern DRC.</p>
<p>The major issue of concern in Central Africa is rapid deforestation, mainly 
  for commercial timber exports. The damage caused to remaining forest areas by 
  timber extraction is an additional concern for the sub-region.</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUES OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS IN CENTRAL 
  AFRICA</h3>
<p>Dense, tropical forests provide essential ecosystem services such as nutrient 
  cycling, water and soil protection, and exchange of atmospheric gases (absorbing 
  carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen). The tropical, moist forest of Central 
  Africa comprises the second largest contiguous area of tropical forest in the 
  world, and thus plays a very important role in atmospheric carbon sequestration 
  and mitigation of potential climate change. Other benefits of forests include 
  the extremely high levels of biodiversity, which has enormous untapped potential 
  for agricultural, pharmaceutical and nutritional applications. There are five 
  regional hotspots in Cameroon, noted for their plant species richness and presence 
  of endemic bird species.</p>
<p>Commercial logging is the primary source of revenue from Central Africa's forests. 
  This is mainly carried out by foreign logging companies and thus ensures substantial 
  amounts of foreign exchange for the countries of the sub-region. Cameroon, for 
  example is one of Africa's leading producers and exporters of sawn timber and 
  tropical logs, and ranks fifth in the world (FAO 2001a, WRI 2001). In 1998, 
  its exports exceeded US$436 million, approximately 5 percent of GDP (FAO 2001a, 
  World Bank 2001). In the same year, Equatorial Guinea exported US$62 million 
  of wood-based panels, representing 14 per cent of its GDP (FAO 2001a, World 
  Bank 2001).</p>
<p>Central Africa's forest ecosystems are also home to a large number of communities 
  from an estimated 250 ethnic groups (WRI 2001). These communities depend on 
  wild and cultivated resources from forests, including bark, vegetables, fruits, 
  flowers, honey, resins, fungi, medicinal plants and wildlife for local consumption 
  as well as for export. Inter-cropping or agroforestry practised within these 
  communities is a vital source of vegetables, grains and fruit, for use by households 
  or for trade. The forests also offer opportunities for tourism, which would 
  generate foreign exchange and stimulate rural development, although these are 
  largely untapped at present because of low levels of infrastructure and/ or 
  conflict in Central African countries.</p>
