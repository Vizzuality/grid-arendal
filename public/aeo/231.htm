<h3>WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN AFRICA? </h3>
<p>An issue that emerges from this analysis of the environment in Africa over 
  the past 30 years is that of human vulnerability. The pressures described above 
  contribute to climate change, declining yields, the spread of diseases and pests 
  and reduced economic potential, among other impacts. These in turn threaten 
  food production and security, human health, economic growth, lives, livelihoods, 
  and infrastructure. Human vulnerability is a highly complex issue involving 
  many and varied social and economic factors, and further research is required 
  to fully understand the links between it and environmental change. These are 
  explored further in <a href="234.htm">chapter 3</a> of this report, but the 
  following conditions and trends are apparent from the foregoing analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Africa is highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture (both crop production 
    and livestock rearing) for national economic growth, and for subsistence of 
    large sectors of the population. Many countries, especially those in the Horn 
    of Africa and the Sahel, are likely to experience increasing variability in 
    rainfall and increasing frequency and intensity of drought over the next few 
    decades. Food production systems in these areas are already under stress from 
    degradation of soil and vegetation and spreading desert margins and countries 
    are already experiencing difficulties in accumulating food reserves. There 
    is therefore a danger that millions of people's livelihoods may be affected 
    and national economic growth will stagnate as a result of repeated crop and 
    livestock losses. Early warning and response systems need to be strengthened 
    urgently, together with long-term means of alleviating economic dependence 
    on cultivation and livestock rearing. The subject of early warning and response 
    is discussed in full in the <a href="032.htm">'Atmosphere'</a> and <a href="171.htm">'Land'</a> 
    sections of this chapter.</li>
  <li>Environmental change can be conducive to outbreaks of pests and disease 
    that impact on human health and economic development. For example, monospecific 
    crop cultivation is more vulnerable to destruction by pests such as locusts; 
    rising average temperatures may encourage the spread of malarial mosquitoes 
    to previously unaffected areas; and reduced freshwater availability and quality 
    increase the risk of infection by gastro-intestinal parasites and bacteria 
    and of skin and eye infections. Issues of human health require a two-pronged 
    approach involving both preventive and curative measures. Preventive measures 
    include maintaining a healthy environment and applying public hygiene standards. 
    Curative measures include investment in health care services. (See <a href="032.htm">'Atmosphere'</a>, 
    <a href="148.htm">'Freshwater'</a> and <a href="203.htm">'Urban Areas'</a> 
    sections for fuller discussion).</li>
  <li>Public and private infrastructure is threatened by sea level rise and increasing 
    frequency of floods and cyclones. These will affect communications and transport 
    networks, administrative and commercial activities, and families and communities. 
    Although loss of infrastructure will result in enormous economic losses for 
    all concerned, it is the poorer communities and the poorer nations that will 
    suffer the most, as they do not have the financial reserves to relocate and 
    rebuild. The sooner action is taken to mitigate these impacts-through construction 
    of physical defences, relocation of populations, and innovative design and 
    construction measures-the more effective such actions will be. (See <a href="032.htm">'Atmosphere'</a> 
    and <a href="094.htm">'Coastal Areas' </a>sections for full discussion).</li>
  <li>The rising costs of water treatment, food imports, medical treatment and 
    soil conservation measures are not only increasing the vulnerability of food 
    and health, they are also draining African countries of their economic resources 
    in the long term and reducing the effective growth of GNP. Preventive measures 
    need to be implemented fully and immediately in order to reverse this trend 
    and improve security in the long term.</li>
  <li>Loss of biological resources translates into loss of economic potential 
    and options for commercial development in the future. For example, deforestation 
    and biodiversity loss, together with inadequate protection of intellectual 
    property rights, are contributing to the loss of resources as well as to a 
    loss of understanding of their applications and hence of commercial potential, 
    thus diverting possibilities for economic growth away from African nations. 
    Loss of these resources is also compromising the health of African populations 
    and rural livelihoods. Conservation practices need to be strengthened and 
    strategies for sustainable use of resources need to be developed urgently 
    to preserve and capitalize on this potential. (See <a href="126.htm">'Forest'</a> 
    and <a href="061.htm">'Biodiversity'</a> sections for fuller discussion).</li>
