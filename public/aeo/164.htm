<h2>CENTRAL AFRICA</h2>
<p>Central Africa rarely experiences problems of water availability, because rainfall 
  is high and generally predictable. However, there is growing competition between 
  user groups, and access to water, particularly in rural areas, is seen as a 
  priority for development. Localized problems of water quality are being raised, 
  especially in coastal areas, where industrial, agricultural and domestic wastewater 
  discharges are high, and where there is an additional threat of saltwater intrusion.</p>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>With the exceptions of the deserts of northern Chad and the Sahelian parts 
  of northern Cameroon and central Chad, the central Africa region is well-endowed 
  with water resources. The total annual renewable resources for the region in 
  2000 were estimated at 1 775 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (UNDP and others 2000). There 
  were significant variations between countries however, with the DRC having the 
  greatest water resources (935 km<sup>3</sup>/yr or 18 000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr), 
  and Chad being the driest country (15 km<sup>3</sup>/yr or 1961 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr) 
  (UNDP and others 2000). Although water use has been on the increase, water deficit 
  is generally unknown in the region. The Congo River basin is the largest in 
  Africa, covering 12 per cent of the region, and is shared by nine countries. 
  The water resources of this area are vital to support livelihoods and economic 
  development, in particular, by providing irrigation water for the cultivation 
  of cash crops. There is some inter-annual variation in rainfall in Central Africa, 
  where flooding is more common in the humid zone. Only in Chad and northern Cameroon 
  is drought a serious threat, and drought frequency has increased over the past 
  30 years (IPCC 1998). In 1973, drought killed 100 000 people in the Sahel, and 
  even countries in the humid zone suffered lowered rainfall and reduced crop 
  yields (Gommes and Petrassi 1996).</p>
<p>The Lake Chad basin is a depression of the seven countries grouped around it, 
  forming a freshwater lake (the Conventional Basin), which is shared by Cameroon 
  (9 per cent), Chad (42 per cent), Niger (28 per cent) and Nigeria (21 per cent). 
  Lake Chad is an important source of water and economic activities, including 
  agriculture and fisheries. Satellite images show that the lake has shrunk considerably 
  over the past 30 years, and is now 5 per cent of its former size, due to persistent 
  low rainfall in the region. IPCC predicts reduced rainfall and run-off, and 
  increased desertification, risks in the Sahelian belt (IPCC 2001), which could 
  mean further reductions in the size of the lake. This would threaten the livelihoods 
  of fishermen and farmers in the region, and poses a challenge for IWRM and international 
  cooperation to ensure sustainability of the resource.</p>
<h4>Access to freshwater resources in Central Africa</h4>
<p>In 1998, the annual withdrawal of freshwater for central Africa was estimated 
  to have been less than 1 per cent of the total available. However, the uneven 
  distribution of water resources, with respect to time and population distribution, 
  has created challenges for water supply. The traditional response to this challenge 
  has been to dam rivers and to distribute water to the people, rather than resettling 
  people closer to water resources. The DRC has 14 dams, Cameroon has nine, and 
  Gabon and Congo each have two. Their main functions are to provide water for 
  domestic consumption, and to provide hydroelectric power, although it is estimated 
  that only half the potential for hydroelectric power is exploited (WRI, UNEP 
  and UNDP 1992). Because of the relatively high reliability of rainfall in this 
  sub-region, irrigation is not always required, and the agricultural sector only 
  consumes 33 per cent of all withdrawals, whereas the domestic sector accounts 
  for more than 50 per cent of all withdrawals (UNDP and others 2000, Shiklomanov 
  1999). Despite these efforts to provide water to municipalities in central Africa, 
  there are significant shortfalls, for example, in Chad, where only 27 per cent 
  of the population has access to improved water sources (WHO/UNICEF 2000).</p>

<p><a name="fig2e9"></a>The reasons for the relatively low access to water in 
  the sub-region include poor economic growth and, thus, low investment in infrastructure 
  development and maintenance, as well as rapid population growth and migration 
  to urban centres. The demand for water for domestic use is predicted to increase 
  fivefold over the next 25 years, due to population growth and increases in per 
  capita consumption (see <a href="#fig2e9">Figure 2e.9</a>). Significant improvements 
  to the existing infrastructure and supply networks are thus required, in order 
  to improve access to potable water over the next 20-30 years. Increasing demand 
  from other sectors is also expected, as agricultural and industrial developments 
  expand to meet economic growth imperatives. </p>
<h4>Improving availability and access to freshwater resources in Central Africa</h4>
<p>The increases in demand for water in central Africa are unlikely to lead to 
  conditions of water stress or water scarcity, because the estimated withdrawals 
  are still small compared to the available resources. However, reductions in 
  rainfall related to climate change are expected in parts of northern Cameroon 
  and Chad, and this will exacerbate already inadequate water supply systems. 
  Therefore, localized problems of water supply may be exacerbated. In addition, 
  further studies are required to investigate the ecological consequences of damming 
  rivers, diverting flows and abstracting water, before ecologically and socially 
  acceptable standards can be established.</p>
<p>Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria formed the Lake Chad Basin Commission in 
  1964, and were later joined by Central African Republic in 1999. The objective 
  of the Lake Chad Basin Commission is to ensure the most rational use of water, 
  land and other natural resources, and to coordinate regional development. In 
  March 1994, the commission approved the Master Plan for the Development and 
  Environmentally Sound Management of the Natural Resources of the Lake Chad Conventional 
  Basin. This document consisted of 36 projects relating to: water resources; 
  agriculture; forestry; biodiversity management livestock; and fishery developments. 
  Funding was made available through the GEF, in order to coordinate these projects 
  by means of: the establishment of joint regulations on the development and use 
  of resources; information collection and sharing; and joint actions and research 
  programmes. An international campaign to save Lake Chad was also launched. In 
  July 2000, the Lake Chad Basin Commission states met, and agreed on a proposal 
  to establish the whole of Lake Chad as a transnational Ramsar site. Other projects 
  agreed to include the development of an Inter-basin Water Transfer Scheme, and 
  strengthening of Joint Patrol Teams (Lake Chad Basin Commission 2000).</p>
