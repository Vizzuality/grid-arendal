<h4>The narratives</h4>
<p>The fortress world is not an invention of today, but a historic norm. Looking 
  into human history, there are many examples of the élite living in prosperity 
  in protected fortresses, while the majority of the public are poor, working 
  mainly for the benefit of that élite. In some cases, the élite imposed taxes 
  and fines-a reflection of the breakdown and failure of policy reforms undertaken 
  by governments, and of the loss of coping capacity to meet the challenges and 
  evolving world trends of globalization and trade liberalization.</p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, before the complete breakdown of the whole 
  society, the élite perceive and comprehend the dangers of falling into complete 
  anarchy and chaos, and organize themselves into enclaves or strongholds to protect 
  their interests, families, businesses and assets. They create strong alliances 
  amongst themselves at national and regional levels, through networks across 
  continents. Furthermore, these alliances are well connected to global systems, 
  and are driven by the interests and mechanisms of such systems, especially through 
  the multinational companies which operate within the élite strongholds or fortresses. 
  With the increase and dominance of cynical attitudes amongst these alliances, 
  economic and social welfare in the region are not directed at improving the 
  general well-being of the public majority, but at protecting the privileges 
  of the rich and powerful élite. This situation paves the way to increasing tensions 
  and disputes over issues of wealth and power between individuals, institutions, 
  governments, factions and ethnic groups. Increasing tension outside the fortress 
  produces a siege mentality within the élite, who feel their security threatened. 
  This leads to high investment in security.</p>
<p>A combined effect of interacting driving forces has led to the rapid impoverishment 
  of the African region: SAPs have failed to realize the economic reform they 
  were set to achieve; unfavourable international trade terms have marginalized 
  Africa in the global economy; and servicing and repayment of foreign debt have 
  paralysed economic advancement in Africa. A number of external shock waves have 
  led to a major crisis in the region. These include: the collapse of international 
  commodity prices; world economic recession, for example, the Asian crisis of 
  1997-98; deterioration in governance; several regional conflicts; and the spread 
  of epidemic diseases, such as AIDS.</p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, there is a general decline in the capacity 
  of the state to perform adequate developmental tasks, including even routine 
  administration functions, outside of the fortress. The state thus fails to meet 
  the basic needs of the people, leading to erosion of legitimacy, and the breakdown 
  of peace and security. The accountability and transparency of the government 
  and public officials erode or vanish. The security and protection of the élite 
  and government officials become a top priority issue. To safeguard their interests, 
  they mobilize all possible security resources, from the public to the private, 
  including police, armed forces, militia and even mercenaries. The regional system, 
  in turn, is well connected to an updated system of global apartheid, dominated 
  by a minority of rich-country élite. Therefore, the enclaves of urban-based 
  élite get control of wealth and power, while the poor majority have no privilege 
  to exercise any leverage on public policy or budgetary choices.</p>
<p>The economy and the structural systems of the élite are strongly influenced, 
  if not completely driven or controlled, by multinational corporations. Their 
  systems and laws override and impose on the local, weakened state systems. Nevertheless, 
  the informal sector starts to play a key role in the local economy of the poor 
  groups, but primarily caters to its own needs and demands (food, housing and 
  transport).</p>
<p>Corruption in all forms spreads at all levels, within and between countries, 
  and at the interface between the public and private sectors. This is not only 
  in the form of money or in-kind payment but, more widely in the African context, 
  in the form of favouritism (nepotism) towards relatives and friends. The spread 
  of corruption has its toll on society: losses in economic efficiency; disintegration 
  of the work ethic; damage to the moral fabric of society; the distortion of 
  incentives and distribution; and loss of political legitimacy (IJNSIA 1997).</p>
<p>Two variants of the Fortress World scenario could unfold in Africa. One variant 
  is a self-generated fortress world, driven mainly by African issues-such as 
  those that have been haunting the region for the past 50 years-while most of 
  the rest of the world remain unaffected and possibly prosperous. The other variant 
  is a global fortress world, in which the world economic, social and political 
  systems collapse, with severe manifestations reflected in Africa, which is the 
  most vulnerable region to such global failure.</p>
<p>The tides of geopolitics surge across Africa, with regional alliances influenced 
  by external forces. The western world, in general, prefers to deal with Africa 
  as sub-Saharan Africa. Europe, specifically since the colonial era, has dealt 
  with Northern Africa in the Mediterranean context. More recently, there is even 
  greater interest in this Mediterranean context, with the European perception 
  of Northern Africa and the Middle East as an intimate geographic extension that 
  has economical, political and cultural dimensions which have a direct impact 
  on Europe. The 'Euro-med' partnership is a manifestation of such interest. In 
  the Fortress World scenario, this background has implications for regional alliances 
  between the élite of Northern Africa and Europe. Such external views of a divided 
  Africa go against the true African view- originating from within the region-of 
  one united Africa. This African view was the driving force for the creation 
  of the OAU, which works to unite and strengthen the integration of all the African 
  countries. The alliances in a fortress world, driven by individuals and special 
  groups interests, are likely to weaken the trend of African unity and integration.</p>
<p>At the turn of 21st century, it is no surprise to see many aspects and elements 
  of the fortress world manifesting themselves in all societies, in all countries. 
  Examples of fenced, highly secured residential complexes, and segregated private 
  schools and clubs for the élite, are common in most world societies. In many 
  countries, businesses are concentrated in the hands of a small group of élite, 
  with strong barriers to prevent outsiders breaking into their systems and obtaining 
  any business opportunities. With the current economic, social, political and 
  environmental conditions in Africa, some people argue-with mounting evidence-that 
  the fortress world is already dominating many African countries and even sub-regions, 
  from Western to Central to Eastern Africa.</p>
