<h3>FOOD SECURITY </h3>
<p>Hunger is the most extreme manifestation of the multidimensional phenomenon 
  of poverty, and the eradication of hunger is instrumental to the eradication 
  of other dimensions of poverty. Persistent widespread hunger impedes progress 
  in other aspects of poverty reduction, and weakens the foundation for broad-based 
  economic growth. Hunger also represents an extreme instance of market failure, 
  because the people who are most in need of food are the least able to express 
  this need in terms of effective demand (FAO 2001).</p>
<p>The FAO defines 'food security' as a state of affairs where all people at all 
  times have access to safe and nutritious food which enables them to maintain 
  a healthy and active life. Food security, therefore, implies the provision of 
  safe, nutritious, and quantitatively and qualitatively adequate food, as well 
  as access to it by all people (NFSD 1996). Food security has three dimensions: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>availability of sufficient quantities of food of appropriate quality, supplied 
    through domestic production or imports; </li>
  <li>access by households and individuals to appropriate foods for a nutritious 
    diet; and </li>
  <li>optimal uptake of nourishment, thanks to a sustaining diet, clean water 
    and adequate sanitation, together with health care.</li>
</ul>
<p>Households seeking to preserve food security levels may resort to a number 
  of coping strategies to gain access to food. These include: maintaining normal 
  income-generating patterns; adaptation by means of innovative use of available 
  resources or some Agriculture, of which 85-90 per cent is rain-fed in sub-Saharan 
  Africa, accounts for 35 per cent of the region's gross national product (GNP), 
  40 per cent of exports and 70 per cent of employment (World Bank 2000). Year-to-year 
  swings in GDP can be as high as 15-20 per cent, largely as a result of the effects 
  of fluctuations in rainfall on agricultural production (World Bank undated). 
  With the greatest part of African agriculture being rain-fed crop farming, food 
  insecurity is largely caused by variability of rainfall (Khroda 1996). Moreover, 
  about one-third of the region has a mean annual rainfall of less than 700 mm, 
  which is too little to sustainably support rain-fed crop production.</p>
<p>Agricultural production varies from one sub-region to the other and is projected, 
  due to the impact of climate change, to significantly reduce production in the 
  tropics and sub-tropics, areas where food insecurity and hunger are already 
  a problem (IPCC 1998). <a href="#box314">Box 3.14</a> describes the situation 
  in the Lake Chad basin, where the adverse climatic factor of drought, coupled 
  with unsustainable human activities, have contributed to a reduction in the 
  volume of water in the lake and its biodiversity. </p>

            <p>Over the years, the effects of drought and unsustainable human 
              activities have continued to degrade the Lake Chad basin in general 
              and the lake itself in particular, in terms of water availability 
              and biodiversity. Water in the lake and its surrounding water systems 
              is decreasing at an alarming rate. This persisting degradation of 
              the entire ecosystem is compromising the performance of agriculture, 
              fishery and livestock, which totally depend on the water and biological 
              resources. The net effect has been the vulnerability of the population 
              in the zone which is occupied mainly by nationals of Cameroon, Chad, 
              Niger and Nigeria. The problem is expected to worsen in the coming 
              years as population and irrigation demands continue to increase.</p>
            <p>In 1960-63, the lake's surface area was 25 000 km<sup>2</sup>; 
              today, it is only 1.350 km<sup>2</sup>. It has been calculated that 
              25 per cent of the decrease in surface area took place between 1966 
              and 1975, as a result of drought and excessive evaporation. The 
              persisting low rainfall in the Lake Chad basin has affected its 
              water systems regime. This persisting/chronic degradation of the 
              run-off of the lake's river systems has been compared to 'disease 
              of water' or 'hyper-draining' by some experts. The increase in agricultural 
              water use and the loss of water due to drier climate are exacerbating 
              the massive decrease of water in the lake. Groundwater is abundant, 
              but is difficult to exploit.</p>
            <p>The prolonged rainfall deficits and the generalized low levels 
              of the river systems will gradually affect the stocks of groundwater 
              in the region. A total of 11 million people live in the Lake Chad 
              basin. The population is projected to reach 23-30 million in 2020, 
              increasing informal settlements and causing acute water shortage. 
              Demographic pressure, drought, bush fires, unsustainable farming 
              activities and deforestation are exerting pressure on water and 
              soil. The lake is shrinking, and fisheries are decreasing. The consequences 
              of this situation have been drastic reductions in food production 
              in the basin and increased vulnerability as a result of food insecurity.
