<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE IN EASTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Low levels of industrialization and urbanization in Eastern Africa mean that 
  the sub-region's contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions is negligible-less 
  than 2 per cent of Africa's total emissions in 1996 (African Development Bank 
  2001). However, the impacts of climate change, particularly on food security, 
  are a priority concern for this sub-region.</p>
<p>Climate change impacts include reduced rainfall (a reduction of 10 per cent 
  by 2050 is anticipated for the Horn of Africa), increased temperatures, and 
  increased evaporation (IPCC 1998, IPCC 2001b). Resulting shifts in vegetation 
  zones will be felt particularly in the areas of agriculture, tourism, energy, 
  industry and commerce (Ottichilo and others 1991).</p>
<p>ENSO events may also be influenced by climate change, but it is not known at 
  this stage whether flood frequency and intensity in Eastern Africa will increase. 
  Increased rainfall intensity, together with degraded vegetation cover, would 
  make the sub-region more prone to landslides associated with flooding.</p>
<p>Rises in sea levels and sea temperatures could have devastating consequences 
  on the Eastern African coast with risk of inundation of many important commercial 
  centres, loss of infrastructure, and population displacement. For example, port 
  activities at Dar es Salaam and Mombasa may be interrupted, and tourism activities 
  and potential activities foreclosed. The coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean 
  are particularly at risk from sea temperature rise-almost 90 per cent of the 
  sub-region's corals suffered bleaching during the 1997/8 warm ENSO event (Obura 
  and others 2000).</p>
<p>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Eastern Africa In response 
  to growing concern over climate change in the sub-region, almost all governments 
  have ratified the UNFCCC and Burundi has ratified the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>The Kenyan government has established a National Climate Change Activities 
  Coordinating Committee, with members drawn from the ministries of agriculture 
  and forestry, energy, planning, finance, and industry, and from research institutes, 
  municipal councils, public universities, the private sector, and NGOs. The Council 
  will coordinate and facilitate research, response strategies, policy options, 
  public information and awareness, and liaison with the IPCC.</p>
<p>Several countries have developed national strategies for disaster prevention, 
  preparedness, and management. In Ethiopia, this was followed by the establishment 
  of a five-year plan for the Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, 
  in 1998. Successes of the plan's implementation include a ten-fold increase 
  in food reserves (WFP 2000).</p>
