<h4>Intergovernmental Authority on Development</h4>
<p> In 1986, six drought-stricken countries-Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, 
  Sudan and Uganda-created the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Development 
  (IGADD), in order to coordinate development in the Horn of Africa. IGADD was 
  later renamed the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). Eritrea 
  became the seventh member of IGAD in September 1993. In April 1996, the IGAD 
  Council of Ministers identified three priority areas of cooperation: conflict 
  prevention, management and resolution, and humanitarian affairs; infrastructure 
  development in the areas of transport and communications; and food security 
  and environmental protection. </p>
<h4>Common Market for East and Southern Africa</h4>
<p>In December 1994, the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) succeeded 
  the Preferential Tr ade Area (PTA), which had been established in 1981. COMESA's 
  main focus has been on the formation of a large economic and trading unit which 
  is capable of overcoming some of the barriers that are faced by individual states. 
  COMESA's strategy is 'economic prosperity through regional integration'.</p>
<h4>African Union and the New African Initiative</h4>
<p>Some 38 years after the establishment of the OAU, African heads of state meeting 
  in Sirte, Libya in March 2001 declared the establishment of the African Union 
  (AU). The main thrust of the AU is to build capacities, in order to enhance 
  the economic, political and social integration and development of the African 
  people.</p>
<p>Crowning the birth of the AU is the New African Initiative, unanimously adopted 
  by the Lusaka Summit on 11 July 2001. The New African Initiative represents 
  a merger between the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery Programme 
  (MAP) and the OMEGA Plan. It is a pledge by African leaders based on a common 
  vision to eradicate poverty. The New African Initiative is also a conviction 
  by African leaders to place their countries, both individually and collectively, 
  on a path of sustainable growth and development, and to participate actively 
  in the world economy and body politic. It is a call for a new relationship-one 
  of partnership-between Africa and the international community, in order to overcome 
  the development chasm.</p>
