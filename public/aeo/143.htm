<h2>WESTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Western Africa is characterized by a marked gradation of climate which is reflected 
  in zones of vegetation cover. Dense rain forest and semi-deciduous forests dominate 
  in the coastal belt. Moving northwards, there is a transition from forest to 
  savanna which eventually gives way to sub-Sahelian savanna in northern Mali, 
  Mauritania, and Niger. In total, there were 72 million hectares of forest in 
  2000, equivalent to almost 12 per cent of the sub-region's land area, and representing 
  11 per cent of Africa's total forest cover (FAO 2001a).</p>

<p><a name="fig2d8"></a>The Upper Guinea Forest, a strip of tropical moist forest 
  that runs parallel to the coast from Guinea to Cameroon (see <a href="#fig2d8">Figure 
  2d.8</a>) is one of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots and ranks first in 
  terms of mammalian species diversity (Conservation International 2001). It is 
  estimated that only 20 per cent of the original extent still remains, and this 
  is highly fragmented (Conservation International 1999). The rarest subspecies 
  of gorilla, the Cross River Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is found in fragments 
  of this forest in Nigeria and Cameroon. With a remaining population of 200-250 
  individuals, this species is critically endangered (Butynski 2001). The largest 
  continuous section of the Upper Guinean forest is in Liberia, where civil unrest 
  threatens conservation activities. However, several initiatives are underway 
  in Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra 
  Leone and Togo to manage the forest and protect endangered species. Forest loss 
  and fragmentation are thus the most important issues in Western Africa.</p>
<h3>ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUES OF FORESTS AND WOODLANDS IN WESTERN 
  AFRICA</h3>
<p> Commercial timber production is an extensive and lucrative occupation in Western 
  Africa, contributing significant proportions of income and foreign exchange. 
  For example, in 1998, Côte d'Ivoire exported US$228 million worth of wood products 
  (mostly sawnwood), Ghana exported US$140 million worth (FAO 2001a). Forest and 
  woodland products are also extremely important to local communities, and the 
  people of Western Africa are highly dependent on forest and savanna resources 
  for their energy needs, most of which are met from wood. In 2000, over 175 million 
  m<sup>3</sup> of wood were used in Western Africa for fuelwood and charcoal 
  production (FAO 2001b). In Gambia, 85 per cent of energy needs are met from 
  wood and charcoal, in Niger, biomass, mainly wood, meets 90 per cent of needs 
  (FAO 2001a). Other resources heavily used by local communities are wildlife 
  (bushmeat), medicinal plants, wood and rattan for construction, furniture and 
  crafts, honey, nuts and fruits, and animal fodder, gums, dyes, teas, spices 
  and aromatics. The most widely used wild food species is the wild yam, a staple 
  in Western African diets. Palms, together with some 35 other species, are important 
  resources for the wine and beer making that contributes significantly to the 
  daily incomes of rural households in Western Africa (African Ethnobotany Network 
  2000). Palm cabbage, made into porridge, is an important 'hungry season' food 
  during the rainy period immediately before the rice harvest.<br clear="all"></p>
