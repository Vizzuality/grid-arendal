<h3>ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES </h3>
<p>A further threat to biodiversity comes from invasion by non-native, or alien, 
  species of plants and animals. These are species that have been introduced both 
  accidentally and intentionally and that are free from their natural predators 
  or other natural limitations to their population growth. They are thus able 
  to dominate plant and animal communities either by out-competing native species 
  for space, light, or nutrients, or through predation.</p>

<p><a name="img2b4"></a>Southern and Eastern Africa and island nations have been 
  particularly affected by the introduction of alien species. The Nile perch (<i>Lates 
  nilotica</i>), introduced into Lake Victoria 30 years ago to stimulate the fisheries 
  of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, is a striking example. In the 1960s, the Nile 
  perch accounted for about 1 per cent of fish catch; it is now dominant in the 
  lake, representing close to 80 per cent of annual fish harvests, and its introduction 
  is believed to have caused the loss of more than 200 endemic species (MoFPED 
  2000). Lack of control on introduction of species has also led to the rapid 
  spread and domination of the water hyacinth (<i>Eichornia crassipes</i>) in 
  freshwater bodies across Africa, including Lake Victoria and Lake Kariba. This 
  weed blocks water channels, alters hydrological regimes, and renders surrounding 
  areas more vulnerable to flooding.</p>
<p>Islands are particularly vulnerable to invasions by alien species, particularly 
  predators, because many island species have evolved in isolation from predators 
  such as cats and rodents. The Western Indian Ocean Islands have experienced 
  dramatic changes to their ecology through the introduction of a range of species, 
  including monkeys, pigs, rats, mice, rabbits, privet, Chinese guava, and wild 
  pepper (UNEP 1999).</p>
<p>Invasion by alien species reduces biodiversity either through predation, competition, 
  or smothering. In some cases alien plants form such dense infestations and produce 
  so many seeds that are dispersed so widely that it is virtually impossible to 
  control them. They also change the dynamics of the natural system and may produce 
  toxic chemicals, inhibiting the growth of native species. In other cases they 
  threaten native species and functioning of ecosystems through an excessive consumption 
  of resources such as water. In Southern Africa, pines, eucalyptus and acacias 
  have been introduced for commercial forestry, but have invaded natural habitats 
  where they threaten ecological integrity by using many times more water than 
  native species (Working for Water 2000).</p>
<h4>Prevention and control of invasion by alien species</h4>
<p>Options to control the introduction and spread of alien species include tightening 
  controls on importation of products of animal or plant origin. However, lack 
  of resources to police borders and entry points and to enforce fines for breach 
  of regulations results in continued threats to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Infestations of alien plants can be physically removed by hand, by mechanical 
  or chemical means, or by a combination of these. Such approaches have been adopted 
  in Lake Victoria and in parts of Southern Africa. Biological control is gaining 
  in popularity as a means of containing populations of alien plants and animals, 
  as it is less harmful to other species and to the surrounding environment. However, 
  it is a more lengthy process, because release of control organisms into an environment 
  has to be rigorously tested to ensure that release has no adverse effects.</p>
