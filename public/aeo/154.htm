<h4>Access to freshwater in Northern Africa</h4>

<a name="fig2e6"></a>The water supply coverage in the sub-region is generally 
high (ranging from 72 per cent in Libya to 95 per cent in Egypt), although urban 
areas are better supplied than rural areas. In rural areas, water supply coverage 
varies (from 58 per cent in Morocco to 94 per cent in Egypt) (WHO/UNICEF 2000). 
Access to sanitation is also generally good but, again, urban areas are better 
supplied than rural areas (WHO/UNICEF 2000). This is because of the high levels 
of water resources development, which have been implemented by the governments 
of northern African countries. However, the demand for water from all sectors 
is rapidly increasing, thus placing enormous pressure on the ecosystems which 
supply and regulate water availability and quality (see <a href="#fig2e6">Figure 
2e.6</a>). 
<p>Agriculture, particularly the production of cash crops, is heavily dependent 
  on irrigation, and consumes more than 80 per cent of withdrawals, while industry 
  and the domestic sector consume 5.6 per cent and 10 per cent of withdrawals 
  respectively (UNDP and others 2000). Irrigated areas represent 100 per cent 
  of cultivated areas in Egypt, 26 per cent in Sudan and 9 per cent in Tunisia 
  (FAOSTAT 1997). In response to the rising demand for water and increasing water 
  scarcity, some countries supplement their water resources through desalination 
  and the reuse of treated municipal wastewater. Tunisia, for example, supplements 
  surface and groundwater extraction with 8.3 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr of desalinated 
  seawater, and 20 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr of treated wastewater (FAOSTAT 1997). 
  In Egypt, 8 per cent of the total water used comes from the reuse of agricultural 
  or municipal wastewater, and less than 1 per cent comes from the desalinisation 
  of seawater, although the flourishing tourism industry is pushing for the severalfold 
  increase of the current desalination capacity by 2010 (FAOSTAT 1997).</p>
<h4>Improving freshwater availability and access in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>The interdisciplinary nature of water problems requires new methods to integrate 
  the technical, hydrological, economic, environmental, social and legal aspects 
  into a coherent framework of IWRM (McKinney and others 1999). Since the 1990s, 
  most northern African countries have realized that the business-as-usual scenario 
  of dealing with water management and water security issues is no longer suitable 
  to cope with future challenges, and they are starting to implement IWRM strategies. 
  Countries have created enabling environments for IWRM by developing legal and 
  institutional frameworks for effective operation. For example Egypt, Morocco 
  and Tunisia have developed national policies and master plans for water management, 
  based on IWRM principles, and the Algerian government has created five Basin 
  Authorities for IWRM. In Tunisia and Egypt, groundwater recharging schemes have 
  been adopted, together with equitable models of water use between user groups. 
  Water use associations have also been formally established in Morocco and Tunisia. 
  Also under the banner of IWRM, a national drought management plan has been put 
  in place in Morocco, and a national programme for the abatement of wastewater 
  discharge into the Nile River has been successfully instituted in Egypt. However, 
  continued support for IWRM is required in terms of: ongoing capacity building; 
  institutional coordination; improved information exchange and processing; and 
  sustainable funding and political commitment.</p>
<p>The Nile Basin Initiative represents an excellent example of cooperation within 
  the framework of IWRM between the ten Nile riparian countries (see <a href="#box2e3">Box 
  2e.3</a>). The Joint Authority for the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer is another example 
  of cooperation between Sudan, Libya, Egypt and Chad, in order to formulate and 
  to monitor strategies for the rational utilization of the NSA.</p>

            <p>Egypt's annual water consumption demands are met by the Blue Nile 
              River (86 per cent), which flows from Lake Tana in Ethiopia, and 
              by the White Nile River (14 per cent), which flows from Lake Victoria 
              in Uganda. Egypt presently uses the majority of the River Nile's 
              flows, and could potentially suffer crippling water reductions if 
              other countries, such as Ethiopia, begin to utilize their share 
              of the Nile's waters for hydroelectric power.Water rights to the 
              Nile have thus become an important issue for the ten Nile riparian 
              countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, 
              Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.).</p>
            <p>The Nile Basin Initiative, launched in 1999, is joint programme 
              of action between the ten Nile riparian countries, with the objectives 
              of ensuring: sustainable resource development; security; cooperation; 
              and economic integration. The first meeting of the International 
              Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) took place in June 
              2001 in Geneva, where the Nile Council of Ministers put forward 
              their Strategic Action Plan to the donor community. So far US$140 
              million has been pledged in support of the region's commitment to 
              peace and sustainable resource development.</p>
