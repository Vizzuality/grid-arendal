<h2>CHALLENGES OF REDUCING HUMAN VULNERABILITY </h2>
<p>In order to effectively reduce human vulnerability and increase security in 
  anticipation of, during or after adverse environmental change, policies need 
  to be adopted which adequately address environmental issues at national, sub-regional, 
  regional and global levels, as well as enhance their implementation. These policies 
  will: </p>
<ul>
  <li>raise incomes and standards of living to alleviate/ eradicate poverty and 
    to improve on livelihoods; </li>
  <li>improve economic performance by restructuring SAPs to focus also on people, 
    not only on institutions, and effecting better debt management; </li>
  <li>assure food security by technologically transforming rain-fed agriculture 
    to more reliable irrigation systems; </li>
  <li>drastically reform land ownership laws to assure security of land tenure; 
  </li>
  <li>take measures to improve health; </li>
  <li>reduce, if not eliminate, civil strife, armed conflicts and warfare; </li>
  <li>develop and rationalize human resources utilization, bring demographic pressures 
    under control and ensure the participatory approach in environmental management; 
  </li>
  <li>rationalize the exploitation of natural resources at sustainable levels; 
  </li>
  <li>integrate environmental concerns into general development planning; </li>
  <li>establish vulnerability assessments and strengthen early warning systems; 
    and </li>
  <li>institute and enforce governance, and ensure a general enabling environment 
    for sustainable development.</li>
</ul>
<p>African countries are party to various policy instruments at global, regional, 
  sub-regional and national levels. However, compliance and implementation with 
  these instruments of environmental management and policy are, in many instances, 
  ineffective (see Chapter 5). This is an indication of policy failures which 
  have to be addressed if Africa is to move towards sustainable development. Policy 
  failures can contribute to increased human vulnerability to environmental change. 
  This can be due to inaction on the part of authorities, unsustainable policies, 
  poor implementation of existing policies or insufficient human and financial 
  resources to give effect to policies. Lack of expertise, an absence of political 
  will, other state spending priorities and the so-called 'brain drain' can all 
  contribute to non-effectiveness of policy.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is absolute need to strengthen policy implementation measures 
  at community, national, sub-regional and regional levels. This certainly calls 
  for support at global level, but the responsibility is that of governments, 
  through the necessary political will and commitment, and in cooperation with 
  their subregional and regional organizations.</p>
<p>African governments should assume their responsibilities to reduce human vulnerability 
  and increase security by lowering risk and enhancing coping capacities. This 
  will require: </p>
<ul>
  <li>capacity building at community and national levels;</li>
  <li> the development of information and communication technology; </li>
  <li>the development and promotion of science and technology; </li>
  <li>the integration of environmental management in development planning; and 
  </li>
  <li>the enhancing of governance and accountability, in order to create an enabling 
    environment for sustainable development.</li>
</ul>
