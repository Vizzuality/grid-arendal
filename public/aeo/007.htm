<p>The poverty of most Africans, and their consequent direct dependence on natural 
  resources for their livelihoods, increases their vulnerability to environmental 
  change. Over the past 30 years, poverty has continued to worsen in Africa and 
  the region's environment has continued to deteriorate, making Africans even 
  more vulnerable to environmental change.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, 61 per cent of the population lives in ecologically 
  vulnerable areas characterized by a high degree of sensitivity and low degree 
  of resilience (IDS 1991) This is not necessarily by choice, but by force of 
  circumstance, because other options are either unavailable or have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Rapid population growth and overexploitation of natural resources, deepening 
  poverty and increasing food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa have brought about 
  human-induced environmental change. Human mismanagement of environmental resources 
  and processes significantly exacerbates the impacts of disasters and their effects 
  on natural resources.</p>
<p>Other factors such as poor economic performance, and weak institutional and 
  legal frameworks have left most Africans with limited choices and low coping 
  capacity. Interventions addressing human vulnerability to environmental change 
  must therefore be translated into integrated responses that reflect the multidimensional 
  nature of the causes and states of vulnerability.</p>
<h3>OUTLOOK: 2002-2032</h3>
<p>Focusing on the next three decades, AEO considers a number of policy options 
  that are likely to have the most significant impact on environment and socioeconomic 
  development. Four scenarios are presented, based on different environmental 
  and social situations that are likely to result from alternative policy interventions. 
  These scenarios are not predictions of the future, but aim to illustrate the 
  range of possible outcomes based upon four policy choices and their interface 
  with environment and developmental conditions, driving forces, and management 
  interventions. The identified driving forces most likely to shape the future 
  are: demographics, economics (including poverty), social, culture, environment, 
  technology and governance.</p>
<p>The four scenarios are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Market Forces</li>
  <li>Policy Reform</li>
  <li>Fortress World</li>
  <li>Great Transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Market Forces</i> scenario presents marketdriven global development, 
  leading to a dominant western-style economy. The environmental impact of this 
  style of development in Africa will be a series of gains tempered by further 
  environmental and social problems, and continued low economic growth.</p>
<p>Potential outcomes of this scenario include: increased incidence of drought 
  and floods; reduction in agricultural production; increased health problems 
  due to continued depletion of the ozone layer; intensification of migration 
  to urban areas; spread of invasive species; increased deforestation; further 
  decrease in the availability of freshwater; increased water-borne diseases; 
  and intensified degradation of coastal and marine resources.</p>
<p>The <i>Policy Reform</i> scenario sees policy adjustments steer conventional 
  development towards poverty-reduction goals. While more significant progress 
  is made in terms of social and economic development, it is largely at the cost 
  of further exploitation of natural resources and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Potential outcomes of this scenario include: gradual decline in atmospheric 
  pollution; expansion of the tourism industry in Africa; more energy choices 
  and hence less dependence on biomass for fuel; meeting of water resource needs; 
  reduced rural urban migration and reduction of conversion of fragile ecosystems 
  into agricultural land.</p>
<p>The <i>Fortress World</i> scenario is a future where socio-economic and environmental 
  stresses mount, the world descends towards fragmentation, extreme inequality 
  in power and socio-economic status, resulting in widespread conflicts, both 
  within Africa and between Africa and other regions.</p>
<p>Potential outcomes of this scenario include: increased vulnerability to climate 
  change; decline in urban air quality and higher incidence of respiratory diseases; 
  declining productivity of grazing and agricultural land and overexploitation 
  of water, land, forest and pasture resources; poor water quality and poor health; 
  depletion of groundwater resources; increased vulnerability of coral reefs and 
  mangrove forests; deterioration of the urban economy and higher incidence of 
  crime.</p>
<p>The <i>Great Transitions</i> scenario describes new development paradigms emerging 
  in response to the challenges of sustainability, new values, pluralism, and 
  planetary solidarity. As this new ethical code is translated into policies that 
  are in turn implemented in an integrated fashion, social and political stability 
  permeate throughout Africa. Renewed ecosystem health and vitality ensure abundant 
  resources and services, sustaining the lives and livelihoods of new generations.</p>
<p>Potential outcomes of this scenario include: improved urban air quality and 
  energy use efficiency; increased equitable access to land; rehabilitation of 
  marginal and degraded lands; decline in biodiversity losses and strengthening 
  of ecosystem integrity; empowerment of communities to manage resources; less 
  pressure on coastal zones; marked increase in access to water and sanitation; 
  and a marked decrease in people living in urban slums and upland settlements.</p>
