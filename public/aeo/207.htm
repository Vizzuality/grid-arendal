<h2>NORTHERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>With 64 per cent of its population living in towns and cities, Northern Africa 
  is the most urbanized sub-region in Africa (UNCHS 2001a). Within the sub-region, 
  urbanization rates vary between countries-36 per cent in Sudan to 95 per cent 
  in Western Sahara (UNCHS 2001a). Most of this growth has occurred in the last 
  two decades, although urban populations have increased steadily since the colonial 
  phase. In 1990-1998, the average rate of urbanization reached 2 per cent per 
  annum (World Bank 2001a), and it is predicted that this will continue over the 
  next 15 years, which means that by 2015, 70 per cent of Northern Africa's population 
  will live in cities (UNCHS 2001a).</p>
<p>Urban growth in Northern Africa is partially the result of rural-urban migration, 
  but natural urban growth and reclassification account for more than 70 per cent 
  of urban development (World Bank 1995). Furthermore, the new structural adjustment 
  programmes adopted by most countries in the sub-region have brought new frontiers 
  in industrial development in the last 10 years. By 1990, Alexandria (Egypt), 
  Algiers (Algeria), Cairo (Egypt), Casablanca and Rabat (Morocco), Tunis (Tunisia), 
  Tripoli (Libya), and Khartoum (Sudan) had populations of more than one million 
  (UNCHS 2001a).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Old and well-established urban centres such as Cairo, Casablanca, Alexandria, 
  and Tripoli continue to thrive and have retained their character despite various 
  economic, social, cultural and political changes. However, urban agglomerations 
  and 'mega-cities' are important features of recent urbanization trends, as well 
  as heavy industrialization. Most infrastructure, and societal services are centred 
  in these cities and they make the greatest contribution to national products. 
  As a consequence, they play a vital part in economic development by providing 
  opportunities for investment and employment. They have also gained a key political 
  and administrative role.</p>
<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Despite the gains outlined above, rapid urbanization in Northern Africa has 
  also given rise to significant environmental and social problems, and is characterized 
  by increasing urban poverty, emergence of informal settlements and slums, shortage 
  in basic urban services, and encroachment on agricultural land. Between 15 and 
  50 per cent of city residents in the sub-region are urban poor living in squatter 
  settlements, illegal subdivisions, sub-standard inner-city housing, custom-built 
  slums, and boarding houses (World Bank 2000). It has also been indicated that 
  cultural heritage sites are especially at risk from uncontrolled development 
  and environmental degradation in urban areas. While there have been national 
  and international efforts to conserve this heritage, greater efforts are required 
  to ensure its protection.</p>
<p>Water supply and sanitation rates are higher in Northern Africa than in some 
  other sub-regions, but they are nonetheless variable and many of the poorer 
  residents of urban centres are without reliable services. In 2000, most urban 
  residents had access to improved water supply (ranging from 72 per cent in Libya 
  to 98 per cent in Algeria) and sanitation (87 per cent in Sudan and 100 per 
  cent in Morocco) (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Casablanca's wastewater network, however, 
  cannot cope with the volume of wastewater produced, despite recent upgrading 
  by the municipality. As a consequence, large quantities of wastewater are discharged 
  into the sea (WHO/UNICEF 2000).</p>
<h4>Unplanned settlements in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>Cairo has several large informal settlements on the city periphery and these 
  accounted for 84 per cent of urban growth between 1970 and 1981 (ABT 1983). 
  In 1992, there were 400 shantytowns in Casablanca, housing more than 53 000 
  families, and in Algiers, 6 per cent of the population are reportedly squatters 
  (UNCHS 2001c). These settlements suffer from a shortage in basic infrastructure 
  and hence have major health problems. Their illegal status compounds the problem, 
  and residents often have to be moved to more appropriate sites where local authorities 
  or municipalities can provide them with basic urban services including water 
  supply, transport or health care (CEDARE 1997, Hamza 1994). More investment 
  is required to provide these services to the whole urban population (Larsen 
  1995).</p>
<p>There has been land use planning and zoning in most of the cities in the sub-region. 
  However, this has not, in some cases, prevented chaotic expansion and densification 
  of cities. It is now the norm to find residential zones next to industrial sites 
  or industries enveloped by housing estates, with all of the potential risks 
  to the environment and to health which that entails.</p>
<p>In 1979, the Egyptian government implemented a strategy for improving the living 
  conditions of urban slum dwellers in Cairo, by moving them to alternative locations. 
  Residents of Eshash El-Torgman and Arab El-Mohamady were moved to El-Zawia El-Hamra, 
  Ain Shams, or Madinat El-Salam. Their original residences were close to the 
  city centre and thus to the job market, whereas the resettled areas were far 
  out of town. Reports of the negative social impact of this move prompted the 
  government to change its approach to informal settlement upgrading, and to adopt 
  a new twofold strategy: clearance for state land (squatter settlements), and 
  upgrading for private land (informal settlements). As a result of social pressure, 
  however, no areas have been cleared, but provision of infrastructure to informal 
  settlements has made significant strides (Manal El-Batran from UNCHS 2001c). 
  In Morocco, settlements have been upgraded in Agadir (see <a href="#box2g2">Box 
  2g.2</a>) and, in Casablanca, the state issued a plan, in 1992, to build 200 
  000 houses for low-income people. Progress has been slow however, as the extent 
  of stateowned land has declined sharply, and privately owned land is very expensive, 
  making subsidized housing unviable (UNCHS 2001c). Over the last three decades 
  the government of Libya has made housing provision a priority and general housing, 
  investment housing, agricultural housing and low-income housing projects have 
  been implemented. Nearly 400 000 units were constructed in various locations, 
  and efforts are well under way to deliver a further 60 000 (UNCHS 2001c).</p>

            <p>The Moroccan National Shelter Upgrading Agency's project in Agadir 
              has been recognised as one of Habitat's Best Practices for Human 
              Settlements. Agadir was devastated by an earthquake in 1960 and 
              housing for lower-income families has been insufficient ever since. 
              In 1992, there were 77 separate shanty areas with 12 500 households 
              (13 per cent of Agadir's population). The Upgrading Agency's project 
              has provided approximately 13 000 serviced housing lots, housing 
              units, apartment units, or lots for apartment units, has provided 
              utilities connections for an additional 3 600 families, and created 
              25 000 jobs per year in construction. Reasons for the project's 
              success include active participation of the clients in project design, 
              implementation and monitoring, recognition of the clients' rights 
              to adequate shelter by local authorities, open dialogue between 
              the parties, and integration of former squatter into cosmopolitan 
              neighbourhoods.</p>
