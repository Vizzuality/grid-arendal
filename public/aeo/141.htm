<h3>FOREST COVER AND QUALITY IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>With resources of such enormous potential value and countries with such low 
  levels of economic and social development, it is not surprising that Central 
  Africa is exploiting forest resources and experiencing large-scale deforestation. 
  Between 1990 and 2000, a total of 9 million hectares of forest were cleared, 
  4 per cent of the total area. The highest annual rates of deforestation were 
  recorded in Cameroon (0.9 per cent), Chad, and Equatorial Guinea (0.6 per cent 
  each), while insignificant rates were recorded in Gabon and Sao Tome & Principe 
  (FAO 2001a). The main causes of deforestation are commercial logging (including 
  illegal activities), clearing for commercial and subsistence agriculture, and 
  fuel wood harvesting. The improved access to forest areas, created by roads 
  constructed for timber trucks, not only fragments the forests but also facilitates 
  exploitation by local communities and resettlement by refugees, who eventually 
  introduce wildfire through their various life-sustaining activities. Previously 
  inaccessible areas are also opened up to poachers and hunters whose activities 
  threaten wildlife.</p>

<a name="fig2d7"></a>By far the greatest threat to forests in the subregion is 
commercial logging and the unsustainable rates of harvesting practised by many 
companies. In Cameroon alone, the number of registered logging companies has more 
than quadrupled, increasing from 106 in 1980 to 479 in 1998 (see <a href="#fig2d7">Figure 
2d.7</a>) (WRI 2001). In addition, weak protection regulations and lack of law 
enforcement have resulted in large numbers of logging violations, and logging 
concessions now encircle protected areas such as the Dja Forest Reserve, a World 
Heritage Site. Violations of forest regulations committed within concession areas 
include the felling of the wrong timber species, logging of protected species, 
and cutting of undersized trees. Unauthorized logging and logging within a protected 
area have also been recorded in Cameroon (WRI 2001). The need to encourage local 
milling and the recruitment of local skilled labour is vital in promoting joint 
conservation efforts.
<p>Clearing of forests for agriculture and collection of fuelwood are other sources 
  of forest loss and degradation in Central Africa. These pressures are set to 
  increase over the next 20-30 years, driven by rapid population growth, poor 
  social development, low employment opportunities, low-income levels, and lack 
  of affordable alternative sources of energy. </p>
<p>The impacts of the various pressures on the subregion's forests are both positive 
  and negative. Positive impacts include the creation of employment in the forestry 
  sector, tax and other sources of revenue. These activities lead to more monetary 
  exchange, the development of a road infrastructure for easier transportation 
  and marketing of local produce, and thus the improvement of conditions for the 
  local populations. On the other hand, the logging methods used and the scale 
  on which they are applied exceed the natural regeneration capacity of the forests. 
  In addition, the negative impacts of soil compaction and chemical pollution 
  on the speed of natural regeneration could be significant. Commercial logging 
  leaves gaps in the canopy that change the microclimate and thus species composition. 
  In closed canopy forest, the regeneration rates are sufficiently high to close 
  gaps relatively quickly. However, in the drier areas of Central Africa, where 
  savanna is the predominant form of wooded vegetation, trees take much longer 
  to grow back, and their removal therefore has a greater impact on the ecosystem. 
  Loss of forest habitat also leads to loss of biodiversity which, in turn, reduces 
  opportunities for commercial agricultural or pharmaceutical exploitation. Other 
  negative impacts of forest degradation include soil degradation and reductions 
  in productivity from agroforestry, susceptibility to alien invasive organisms, 
  and disruption of hydrological systems. Local communities suffer by having to 
  search further and further afield to collect wild resources such as fuelwood.</p>
