<h4>Environmental consequences</h4>
<h5>Atmosphere</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the African environment has been negatively 
  impacted, except in some protected or isolated areas away from human pressure, 
  where limited improvement can be seen. Poor economic performance has driven 
  Africa into fierce competition over ever-dwindling natural resources. Atmospheric 
  emissions remain modest in Africa; however, even when there is greater vulnerability 
  to imperfections in the provisions of international treaties. For example, emissions 
  trading could result in Africa losing cheap credits and having to pay more later 
  per unit of emission reduction. Africa is also more vulnerable to the effects 
  of climate change; for example, malaria extends to new zones. Urban air quality 
  declines in most urban areas, and effects are felt in other areas, because of 
  the failure of mitigation measures, and an increase in urbanization and polluting 
  industries. This leads to incidents of respiratory diseases, such as asthma. 
  In some areas, the quality of air remains the same. Africa is pressured to adapt 
  afforestation and reafforestation programmes, for the good of the polluting 
  west. However, access to large forest areas becomes controlled by the élite. 
  Under continued international pressure, Africa bans totally the use of ozone-depleting 
  substances, such as methyl bromide, with inadequate assistance in the changeover 
  to alternatives, which may be more expensive.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, this sub-region continues to pollute less, 
  but it suffers the consequences of pollution brought about by industries in 
  the north. The consequences are observed through variations and changes in climate, 
  producing some effects on seasonal patterns and agricultural production. International 
  protection conventions, such as the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the 
  1992 Kyoto Protocol, force countries not to continue exploiting forest resources 
  any longer, in order to preserve the natural resources of the Congo Basin for 
  carbon sequestration.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>The impact of climate variability is more devastating, especially for the vulnerable 
  poor, who are eking out a living outside the fortress. Measures to control emissions 
  are not implemented, because people, including those in the fortress, are more 
  concerned with personal security and survival. Air quality deteriorates both 
  within and outside the fortress, making the environment unattractive for investment.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>The air quality in many parts of Northern Africa sees some improvement, due 
  to the interest of the élite in improving it. However, there are differences 
  in the air pollution levels in the rich and poor areas, because of the concentration 
  of industries in poor areas. The élite protect their fortresses against potential 
  climatic changes such as floods, while the poor are left vulnerable to such 
  elements.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa</i></p>
<p>Southern Africa continues to suffer the effects of climate change. At the same 
  time, the sub-region is forced not to exploit its forest resources due to demands 
  for firewood. Unfortunately, this activity decimates an important carbon sink. 
  On the other hand, developed countries, particularly the USA, take their time 
  in ratifying important multilateral environmental agreements, such as the 1992 
  Kyoto Protocol, because they want to protect their industries, as well as to 
  maintain their lifestyles.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, élites consider their farms to be environmentally 
  friendly places, free from the pollution of the cities. They protect large stretches 
  of the countryside from environmental abuse. Because some of these farmers may 
  themselves be in government, or have influence over those who occupy key positions 
  in government, they ensure legislation to protect their farmlands and, thus, 
  the environment. However, the landed aristocrats have no interest in the barren 
  lands and, therefore, condemn them for dumping, irrespective of who lives there.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>The atmosphere in this sub-region is surprisingly little affected by events, 
  except in Madagascar, where the absence of the advantages of sea winds, enjoyed 
  by the smaller islands, results in worsening air quality. Nevertheless, Port 
  Louis, Antananarivo and Victoria have periods of closure due to urban smog, 
  and seek technical advice.</p>
