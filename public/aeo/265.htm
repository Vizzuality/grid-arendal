<h2>QUANTITATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF THE SCENARIOS</h2>
<p>The generation of quantitative expressions for the different scenarios requires 
  the use of models, or input from experts. The applications described in this 
  work were developed at the regional scale, and were organized with the help 
  of the SEI's PoleStar software system. The goal of the PoleStar project is to 
  give operational meaning to the notion of sustainable development, a challenging 
  task which requires a broad view-across issues, over a range of spatial scales 
  and over long timescales. The PoleStar software system has been applied at the 
  global level by the SEI for UNEP's <i>GEO-3</i> report, and also for the scenarios 
  of the GSG. Scenario development in the AEO benefited from the good assemblage 
  of data undertaken by the SEI, but has been modified in different ways. Some 
  of the major driving variables-Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population and 
  urban population-differ from those of the <i>GEO-3 </i>report or the GSG scenarios. 
  In part, this reflects an update of the data for Africa, using more recent information 
  published in Cities in a Globalizing World (UNCHS 2001).</p>
<p>For illustrative purposes, six possible outputs are examined, which represent 
  the four dimensions of: demographics; economy and society; agriculture and forestry; 
  and environment. The demographic dimensions consist of the total population 
  and the urban population figures for Africa, and for each of its sub-regions. 
  The economy and society dimension consists of the GDP measured at the purchasing 
  power parity rates, with 1995 as base. The third dimension, agriculture and 
  forestry, consists of severely degraded cropland. The environment dimension 
  consists of water use and urban household water pollution. The quantitative 
  expressions of the scenarios for these variables are presented as <a href="#fig45">Figures 
  4.5</a>, <a href="#fig46">4.6</a>, <a href="#fig47">4.7</a>, <a href="#fig48">4.8</a>, 
  <a href="#fig49">4.9</a> and <a href="#fig410">4.10</a>.</p>

<p>Populations grow at mid-range levels in the Market Forces scenario. The spread 
  of education for women, poverty-reduction programmes and widespread use of birth-control 
  methods leads to a significant slowing in population growth rates in the Policy 
  Reform scenario, and there is a radical reduction in growth rates in the Great 
  Transitions scenario. In the Fortress World scenario, social collapse, poverty 
  and the failure of educational systems precipitate a massive expansion of the 
  population, reaching, in 2032, four times the population in 1995.</p>
<p>Urban populations follow similar trends to population as a whole. However, 
  the differences between the Fortress World scenario and the Great Transitions 
  scenario are even more pronounced. Widespread alternatives to urban and periurban 
  settlement expansion in the Great Transitions scenario lead a barely perceptible 
  growth in total urban population. In the Fortress World scenario, the loss of 
  farmland to élite interests, land degradation and the collapse of urban markets 
  for rural agricultural produce drives billions of people toward the already 
  overcrowded cities.</p>
<p>Patterns of GDP growth are nearly the inverse of the patterns of population 
  growth. Growth in the Market Forces scenario is rather robust compared to recent 
  experience in the region, but it is slow compared to other developing regions 
  as the new millennium begins to unfold. In the Policy Reform scenario, the gap 
  is much smaller, because several African countries see rapid growth in GDP. 
  The collapse in society, polity and infrastructure in the Fortress World scenario 
  underlies very sluggish growth in per capita income, which grows just barely 
  over the rate of population growth over the scenario period. In the Great Transition 
  scenario, with an international environment that is focusing on equity through 
  more vigorous connections with other southern regions and in a supportive domestic 
  environment, output per person expands rapidly, reaching an average level for 
  the region as a whole that is close to the average of the industrialized countries 
  in 1995.</p>
<p>Cropland degradation rates are highest in the Market Forces scenario and the 
  Fortress World scenario, and the amount of cropland degraded adds to the total 
  that must be converted from other land-use types.</p>
<p>Water use grows under each of the scenarios, as populations expand and incomes 
  grow. In the Policy Reform scenario and the Great Transitions scenario, especially, 
  rising demand for water-intensive end uses is offset by greater efficiency. 
  However, despite relatively greater improvements in water efficiency in the 
  Great Transitions scenario compared to the Policy Reform scenario, the rapid 
  economic growth in the Great Transitions scenario leads to comparable levels 
  of water withdrawals. At the same time, water-use intensity remains well below 
  that of the industrialized regions. In the Fortress World scenario, relatively 
  modest water withdrawals-below those of any of the other scenarios-hide a disturbing 
  picture of collapsing waterdelivery infrastructure and degraded water sources, 
  leading to severe water shortages and declines in the population with access 
  to clean water.</p>
<p>Total water pollution from urban households depends on both the size of the 
  urban population and the water-treatment infrastructure. The high average incomes 
  in the Policy Reform scenario and the Great Transitions scenario, combined with 
  low urban populations, lead to very low total water pollution loadings. In the 
  Great Transitions scenario, urban water pollution falls after 2015, as urban 
  population levels off and treatment continues to improve. The poor infrastructure 
  and rapid urban population growth in the Fortress World scenario leads to a 
  massive increase in total water pollutant loadings from urban households.</p>
