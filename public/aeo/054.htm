<p><a name="img2a8"></a>GHG emissions are minimal in Central Africa, contributing 
  just 2 per cent of Africa's total emissions in 1996. They form a negligible 
  part of global emissions (African Development Bank 2001). Emissions of gaseous 
  pollutants such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane result from a 
  variety of sources, including dumping of gas-producing garbage, use of traditional 
  fuels in domestic energy production, and from slash and burn agriculture. The 
  occasional eruption of Mount Cameroon also contributes to gaseous emissions.</p>
<p>However, global atmospheric and climatic changes will impact on Central African 
  countries, increasing rainfall and temperature fluctuations and thus affecting 
  security of food and water resources. Most of Central Africa will experience 
  increased precipitation, soil moisture and runoff. This could result in a net 
  increase in forest cover, although increased suitability of land for agriculture 
  may lead to accelerated rates of forest clearance. Shifting distribution of 
  natural habitat could also have important consequences for the unique biological 
  resources of the Central African forests, such as the endangered Mountain Gorilla. 
  Other perturbations of hydrological systems may change flooding patterns, increase 
  the risk of contamination of freshwater supplies and encourage outbreaks of 
  water-borne diseases. Malaria and trypanosomiasis may spread to new areas, particularly 
  to areas at higher altitudes where their presence was previously limited by 
  low temperatures, and to drier areas where increased rainfall is predicted (IPCC 
  1998).</p>
<p>Freshwater availability may decrease in the arid and semi-arid parts of Cameroon, 
  Central African Republic and Chad because of decreased rainfall and increased 
  evaporation. Over the past 30 years the level of water in Lake Chad has dropped 
  greatly under the combined pressures of rainfall fluctuations and continued 
  withdrawals and the water level today is around only one-twentieth of what it 
  was 30 years ago (NASA GSFC 2001). The millions of people currently dependent 
  on the lake's resources could suffer enormous economic and food security losses 
  if its level decreases further.</p>
<p>Sea level rise and increased vulnerability to inundation and storm surges will 
  render some of the coastal areas of Central Africa uninhabitable, displace millions 
  of people and threaten low-lying urban areas, such as Douala in Cameroon (IPCC 
  1998, IPCC 2001b).</p>
<h4>Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Central Africa</h4>
<p> In response to the challenges of adverse climatic variations, all countries 
  in Central Africa have joined the international community in signing and ratifying 
  the UNFCCC. At the national level, capacity building amongst stakeholder groups 
  and revision of policies and legislation for enhanced environmental protection 
  is underway, including protection of the sub-region's important forest reserves 
  (see <a href="#box2a5">Box 2a.5</a>). Although this action demonstrates political 
  commitment across the region to addressing the problem, Central African countries 
  emit negligible amounts of GHG and- because they are classed as developing countries 
  under the Kyoto Protocol-they are not yet required to reduce emissions. Climate 
  variability and the impacts of climate change are also being tackled through 
  the establishment of climate modelling programmes and early warning of rainfall 
  variations. These are, however, in the early stages of development and little 
  information on their effectiveness is available.</p>

            <p>Central Africa's extensive tropical forests are important carbon 
              sinks and can assist in mitigating GHG emissions. In the Republic 
              of Congo a research study has been launched to evaluate the carbon 
              sink potential of the tropical forests and develop strategies for 
              forest conservation. Additional studies are underway as part of 
              the Central African Regional Programme for the Environment (CARPE) 
              to develop and implement means of reducing deforestation and biodiversity 
              loss in the Congo Basin.</p>
            <p>The Conference on Ecosystems of Dense Humid Forests in Central 
              Africa (CEFDHAC) is another initiative linked to CARPE, established 
              to improve subregional cooperation on issues of forest management 
              in the Congo Basin.</p>
