<h5>Forests</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, real recognition is given to sustainable 
  uses of forest resources for medicinal and other purposes. Consequently, sensitive 
  and important habitats are protected. Communities are environmentally aware, 
  and are empowered to care for the earth. Areas of forests increase and forest 
  quality improves, as a result of the realization of the true value of forest 
  resources, and improved forest management. Integrated and sustainable development 
  management ensures minimal degradation of the humanenvironment system. Human 
  and environmental vulnerability are minimized. The capacity of NGOs and civil 
  societies is ennhaced, and they are empowered to play a more significant role 
  in environmental management. Higher protection of the environment and of fragile 
  ecosystems is the order of the day.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>This sub-region continues with the development and use of light technology 
  by trained people, in order to make rational use of forest resources. The existence 
  of centres and research institutes, and training in forestry (wood-based occupations), 
  makes Central Africa a specialist in forestry training and research.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>The pressure on forestry resources in this sub-region is sustained and, in 
  some areas, increased by events triggered by the Great Transitions scenario. 
  Increased liberalization opens up the forest sector to both national and foreign 
  direct investment for high quality logs. With the existing net deficit, increased 
  investment in wood conversion tips the deforestation scale. However, the situation 
  ameliorates in the latter parts of the second decade of the scenario, as private 
  sector investment in the afforestation programme starts to yield some harvests. 
  The emergence of regional blocks, such as EAC and the Inter-Governmental Authority 
  on Development (IGAD), and associated free trade policies, also increase the 
  movement of forest products from resource-rich member states to those with deficits, 
  ranging from Uganda to Kenya, and Ethiopia to Eritrea. A lucrative trade with 
  favourable tax incentives is the most likely to lead to mining of the resource. 
  This is further exacerbated by the improvement in transport technology and systems, 
  enabling faster movement of goods in the sub-region.</p>
<p>Technology development, however, negates some adverse impacts. Improved technology 
  expands the scope of species utilized, and improves wood processing through 
  recycling and the use of smalldimension timber and so on. Tree improvement biotechnology 
  leads to high productivity plantations.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the rate of deforestation is greatly reduced, 
  as governments of this sub-region strengthen and enforce legislation governing 
  the exploitation of forests. Better education and public awareness programmes-albeit 
  relatively limited-teach people the importance of forest resources. Droughts 
  and shortage of water resources seem to be the only factors hindering afforestation 
  and reforestation efforts. Because the Northern African countries are able effectively 
  to apply integrated water resources management techniques, they manage to restore 
  the natural forests, or to grow human-made ones. In the Sudan, the value of 
  gum arabic is not overlooked by the forest protection policy, as careful planning 
  ensures the double benefit of producing the gum and preserving the forests.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Cheap micropower technologies gain prominence, reducing the pressure on forests 
  for energy. There is significant growth in technologies, such as solar power, 
  which do not need wood, and efficient wood stoves, such the 'tso-tso' stove, 
  which requires very little fuelwood. The use of better fuels, and the adoption 
  of better heating and cooking technologies, reduce both indoor and outdoor pollution, 
  while concerted efforts by the developed world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
  ameliorate the effects of climate change.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>As a matter of policy, every tree which is destroyed is replaced by two new 
  trees. Not only is there reforestation, there is active afforestation. The benefits 
  are felt throughout the sub-region, especially in the Sahel parts of Western 
  Africa, where Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal lead the way.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Massive reforestation is in hand, with the target of planting ten trees per 
  person per year in the region over the next decade. This ends the devastating 
  decade of barbaric depletion of forests and woodlands. </p>
