<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>Before the colonization of the region, African economies were able to survive 
  large-scale environmental degradation, for a number of reasons. First, the population 
  was small, and the demands on the economy were small. More importantly, the 
  technology was appropriate and adequate, because the African people had learned 
  over centuries to adapt systems of extraction of natural resources to be commensurate 
  with the dictates of the environment. Things have since changed. Modern economic 
  practices have introduced increased demand on human and natural resources, and 
  so that technology has proved inadequate. For instance, attempts to improve 
  agriculture has resulted in the importation of strange varieties of food crops, 
  and the introduction of chemicals and additives to soils, plants and vegetation.</p>
<p>For a large part of the 20th century, Africa's role in the development of science 
  and technology was marginalized. To a large extent, the colonial powers inhibited 
  the development of indigenous technology in Africa, and destabilized some of 
  the existing processes of technical growth. Indigenous manufacturing capability 
  was deliberately undermined in order to facilitate European exports, and captive 
  markets were created. In addition, colonial powers deprived Africa of its historical 
  credit in contributing to advancements in science, technology and medicine (Emeagwali, 
  2000). Furthermore, Africa has not been only a user of technologies developed 
  in the west, but has also been a dumping ground for obsolete technologies abandoned 
  in the west. More recently, Africa has became a testing ground for biotechnology 
  and genetically modified (GM) products.</p>
<p>African countries have also discovered that modern technology is needed to 
  manufacture the goods and services that have become imperative to sustain modern 
  life. Caught in this cycle, dependence on imported technology, with all its 
  consequences, has increased, and the effects on the environment have become 
  severe. Many African countries will readily offer their land to locate even 
  the most obnoxious industries-despite their negative impacts on the people and 
  the environment-provided they will bring in some monetary relief or economic 
  growth.</p>
<p>The craving today is for modern information technology (IT), which is at the 
  heart of so much development. And yet it can be said that Africa has not even 
  begun to establish itself in this arena. Because of its poor economic base, 
  the region has not succeeded in manufacturing computers, the basic hardware 
  required for IT development. Other impediments include: the low number of currently 
  installed telephone lines; the limited provision of facilities such as electricity; 
  and the high levels of illiteracy in the region.</p>
<p>The emergence of micropower technologies is assisted by IT, as this begins 
  to revolutionize the sources of energy needs of peoples in the region. While 
  African countries continue to see modern IT and industrialization as principal 
  agents for economic development, different countries learn to recognize the 
  sequence of timing that is essential to harness good technology and integrate 
  these into the process of development. With the introduction of cleaner fuels, 
  swift transition to renewable resources and greater concern for the environment, 
  the impact of industrialization on the environment is reduced to the barest 
  minimum.</p>
<p>The use of biotechnology in agriculture and in related primary production industries 
  has the potential to influence food and fibre production, food security and 
  management. There are both benefits and risks associated with the release of 
  genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The search for new pharmaceuticals, based 
  on chemical compounds found in plants, can serve as a stimulus to conserve biodiversity. 
  It also has the potential, albeit possibly a minor one, to serve as a source 
  of income for local people.</p>
