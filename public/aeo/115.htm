<p>Marine and coastal ecosystems are being degraded rapidly in Southern Africa 
  by pollution from land-based activities and dumping at sea. Land-based pollution 
  sources include discharge of sewage, industrial effluents, stormwater run-off, 
  wind-blown litter, suspended sediments, and agro-chemicals. The increase in 
  these types of pollution is largely a result of the rapid growth in population 
  and in tourism in coastal centres, and of unsustainable land management practices 
  inland. For example, in South Africa, the populations of Cape Town and Port 
  Elizabeth, two major coastal cities, grew by 22 per cent and 24 per cent respectively 
  during the 1990s (Macy 1999). Raw sewage is discharged in these cities because 
  the large and rapidly growing population requiring sanitation facilities exceeds 
  the capacity of municipal treatment plants. In South Africa, there are some 
  63 ocean outfalls along the coast discharging approximately 800 000 m<sup>3</sup> 
  of sewage and industrial effluent into the sea every day. Most of the large 
  pipelines discharge into deeper waters, but 27 older pipelines discharge above 
  the high water mark (DEA&T 1999). This is dangerous to human health because 
  bathing waters are contaminated and popular seafood species such as mussels 
  may become contaminated.</p>

<a name="img2c8"></a>Industrial effluents in the sub-region come mainly from large 
fish processing plants, abattoirs, and chemical and manufacturing industries. 
In the case of Mozambique, for example, 126 factories in and around Maputo do 
not have waste treatment plants and their drains discharge toxic wastes, poisons, 
non-degradable substances and organic matter into their neighbourhoods (Chenje 
& Johnson 1996). Most of Tanzania's textile mills release dyes, bleaching agents, 
alkalis and starch directly into Msimbazi Creek in Dar es Salaam, from where they 
can easily flow into the Indian Ocean (Chenje & Johnson 1996). Agricultural run-off 
containing fertilizer residues and soil sediments contributes to silting of estuaries 
and to smothering of habitats, and has also been suspected of contributing to 
the occurrence of toxic algal blooms (such as red tides). Pollution of coastal 
and marine environments poses a threat to human health, through direct contact 
or through consumption of contaminated fish or seafood. It also degrades marine 
environments, resulting in declines in economic returns from fisheries and tourism. 
<p>Solid waste also enters the marine environment through stormwater run-off or 
  is blown out to sea. Plastics constitute an increasing proportion of marine 
  and coastal litter and present a particular hazard because of their endurance 
  in the environment. Litter, especially plastics, kills many marine animals through 
  ingestion and entanglement. It is also unsightly and a hazardous deterrent to 
  beach users (Ballance, Ryan & Turpie 2000, Ryan 1996). Efforts have been made 
  to reduce the volume of plastics entering the marine environment in South Africa, 
  including regulations on the thickness of plastics used in the packaging industry 
  and incentives for re-use of plastic bags or use of alternative materials (Ministry 
  for Environmental Affairs & Tourism 2000).</p>
<p>Sources of pollution at sea include accidental and deliberate discharges of 
  oil and dumping of garbage such as plastics. Dredge spoils-often rich in heavy 
  metals such as lead, copper, zinc, mercury, and cadmium-are dumped at designated 
  sites. There have been several recent incidences of oil spills off the South 
  African coast that have had serious adverse effects on the Africa penguin populations 
  in the area and on other marine life, particularly large numbers of sea birds, 
  seals, as illustrated in <a href="#box2c4">Box 2c.4</a>.</p>

            <p>In June 1994, the iron ore carrier the Apollo Sea broke up and 
              sank in Table Bay. The resulting pollution caused oiling of 10 000 
              penguins, of which 5 000 died. The clean-up costs of this disaster 
              were estimated at around US$1.5 million, including costs of beach 
              cleaning, penguin rehabilitation, and interruption of port activities. 
              Six years later, another vessel, the Treasure, spilled more than 
              1 500 tonnes of fuel oil and 20 000 penguins were oiled. In the 
              world's largest and most successful seabird rescue operation (involving 
              members of the public from all over South Africa) almost 20 000 
              birds were translocated to avoid further oiling, and oiled birds 
              were rehabilitated and released.</p>
