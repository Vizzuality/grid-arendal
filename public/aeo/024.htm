<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA</h3>
<h4>United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</h4>
<p class="boxBody">The major environmental highlight of the past decade was the 
  1992 UNCED, or Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Africa played a 
  major role both during the process leading up to UNCED and at the conference 
  itself. The region, through the OAU, presented the African Common Position on 
  Environment and Development, which highlighted the region's environment and 
  development priorities. The environmental challenges facing Africa and the rest 
  of the world were articulated by the then UN Secretary-General, Butros Butros 
  Ghali, at the opening of UNCED (see <a href="#box14">Box 1.4</a>).</p>
<p class="boxBody">Perhaps the most defining decision of the 1992 Earth Summit 
  was the granting of equal footing, in the Rio Declaration, to both the environment 
  and to development. This was a significant departure from the 1972 Stockholm 
  Conference, which gave prominence to the environment, despite its groundbreaking 
  decisions on political, social and economic issues. While the Stockholm Conference 
  defined an environmental right, the Earth Summit not only reaffirmed this right, 
  but also balanced it with 'the right to development', which it said must be 
  fulfilled 'to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present 
  and future generations'. This reaffirmation echoes the 1991 Abuja Treaty Establishing 
  the African Economic Community (see <a href="#box15">Box 1.5</a>), which sets 
  out Africa's obligations towards natural resources and development.</p>

                  <p>'It is indeed an historic conference. Possibly, future generations 
                    will call it a turning point, a moment in history when a major 
                    correction was introduced in the process of the industrial 
                    revolution which started, less than 200 years ago, to transform 
                    so profoundly conditions on our planet ... While the environment 
                    is an emerging new and very serious problem, we must not forget 
                    that development is still the highest priority and an unreached 
                    objective.'</p>

<p>At the Earth Summit, the eradication of poverty was identified as an indispensable 
  requirement for sustainable development, in order to decrease the disparities 
  in standards of living and to better meet the needs of most people in the world. 
  The Earth Summit also called for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>elimination of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption; </li>
  <li>enhancement of the development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer of technologies, 
    including new and innovative technologies;</li>
  <li>recognition that environmental issues are best handled with the participation 
    of all concerned citizens at the relevant level; </li>
  <li>enactment of effective environmental legislation; </li>
  <li>implementation of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) before projects 
    are undertaken;</li>
  <li>recognition of the vital role women play in environmental management and 
    development, and<br>
    the need to ensure their full participation;and </li>
  <li>recognition of the vital role of indigenous people and their communities, 
    and of other local<br>
    communities, in environmental management.</li>
</ul>
