<h5>Coastal and marine resources</h5>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, urbanization and population movement to coastal 
  areas continue at higher rates. The demand for marine resources for food and 
  shelter increases. The élite utilize Africa's unique coastal and marine resources 
  for tourism, and aggressively market them globally, through multinational companies. 
  An increase in eco-tourism opportunities contributes to sustainable management 
  of resources, such as forests, coastal and marine resources. However, fulfilling 
  the needs of locals and tourists results in overfishing.</p>
<p>Marine pollution increases locally as water treatment of sewage declines. In 
  some poorer areas, there are no sanitation systems and no sewage treatment. 
  Valuable coral reefs and mangrove forests become increasingly vulnerable, and 
  threatened with human activities. However, some areas improve as a result of 
  stagnant development activities and protection by the élite.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>In spite of laws in force in this sub-region, the exploitation of coastal areas 
  continues, leading to an increase in coastal erosion. Coastal and marine pollution 
  continues unabated, because of population pressure resulting from housing development 
  The insular countries of the sub-region run the risk of disappearing as polar 
  ice cools, creating an upsurge of ocean water levels.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the environment along the coastal and marine 
  areas remains quite diversified. The population and densities of people in old 
  developments along the Mediterranean coast suffer from further congestion. The 
  rate of infrastructure development is much slower than the rate of population 
  increase, leading to severe pollution of the coasts and seawater. On the other 
  hand, the élite develop new areas along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea 
  and the Red Sea for recreation and water tourism. Every care is taken to minimize 
  the environmental impacts of those new developments. Nevertheless, the élite 
  overexploit the soil along the coasts, neglecting the serious damage this causes 
  to coastal waters and marine life. Many rare marine species are threatened or 
  totally destroyed. Unsafe abstraction of groundwater within the coastal zone 
  of the Mediterranean Sea causes seawater intrusion and, hence, renders many 
  wells unusable.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Uncontrolled development in coastal areas accelerates coastal erosion, at the 
  same time polluting the seas, due to lack of adequate facilities to collect 
  and properly dispose of rubbish. Growth in population in coastal areas, such 
  as Maputo, Dar es Salaam and Durban, exacerbates the overexploitation of marine 
  resources, including mangroves, fish and prawns.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, while the élite begin spending most of their 
  time on the large, environmentally friendly farms, they maintain their showcase 
  or dream houses in the cities-quite often in close proximity to the Atlantic 
  Ocean or the big rivers. Although, initially, each family was concerned only 
  about its immediate environs, or the piece of land adjoining the beaches and 
  waterfronts, they realize that they are unable to enjoy their prized places 
  if the waters are polluted. Thus, they participate in the exercise of cleaning 
  the beaches and waterways. Their representatives in government put in place 
  appropriate policies and laws to protect coastal and marine areas. The élite 
  are, however, very uncooperative when policies tend to restrict the exploitation 
  of coastal and marine resources in a way that affects their investments in the 
  fishing industry.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Coastal and marine areas are seriously affected by military operations, piracy 
  and overfishing, using fine nets, gelignite and seabed trawling. Oil pollution 
  from major tanker spills, following naval action in pirate wars in the 2020s, 
  scars coastlines and causes irretrievable damage to marine stocks. Sea mines 
  laid in the same period remain a hazard to all regional marine traffic, causing 
  continual loss of shipping and life, and diverting away most trade from other 
  regions.</p>
