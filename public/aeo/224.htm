<p>Africa has a long and varied coastline supporting a diversity of habitats, 
  resources, and economic activities. There has been rapid urban and industrial 
  development and growth in tourism in many coastal zones without adequate planning, 
  protection, or provision of infrastructure. As a result of this-and of phenomena 
  in the hinterland such as deforestation and soil erosion- coastal erosion is 
  a growing concern, particularly in Western Africa, Eastern Africa, and the Western 
  Indian Ocean Islands. Sea level rise due to climate change is a real and serious 
  threat to the Western Indian Ocean Islands and to low-lying coastal settlements, 
  particularly in Northern, Western and Central Africa. Sea temperature rise has 
  the potential to cause coral bleaching which would have damaging impacts on 
  the economies of the countries bordering the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean.nder pressure from pollution from 
  land-based and sea-based sources. Oil pollution is a major threat, with high 
  levels of oil transportation threatening the eastern and southern African coast 
  and islands, and oil drilling and processing activities causing problems along 
  the northern, western and central African coast.</p>
<p>Domestic, industrial and agricultural effluents are problems in most sub-regions, 
  especially around large urban or industrial coastal centres, and in Western 
  and Central Africa where commercial plantations are common in the coastal zone. 
  Overharvesting of coastal and marine resources is a priority concern for countries 
  of Southern and Western Africa and for the island states, because of their relatively 
  large area of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p>
<p>Most coastal African countries are party to relevant international conventions 
  and have national policies and regulations for sustainable coastal development 
  and use of marine resources. In particular, Integrated Coastal Zone Management 
  (ICZM) plans have been developed by many countries, showing commitment to conservative 
  use of the coastal zone and marine resources. These plans are, however, wide-ranging 
  in nature and require considerable resources such as trained personnel, equipment, 
  financial resources, and more effective policing, monitoring, administration 
  and enforcement. Lack of coordination between government departments and between 
  countries is an additional constraint on their effectiveness. Coordination should 
  be strengthened. <a href="#fig2s3">Figure 2s.3</a> shows the threats to Africa's 
  coastal and marine environment.</p>
