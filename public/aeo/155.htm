<h3>WATER QUALITY IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Major water quality problems in northern Africa include: salinization; pollution; 
  and eutrophication of surface and/or groundwater. Increased salt content of 
  surface and groundwater is mainly due to irrigation return flows and saltwater 
  intrusion along the Mediterranean coast. Poorly sited or illegal waste dumping 
  and seepage from landfills, together with localized sanitation problems, are 
  the major causes of surface and groundwater pollution; and eutrophication of 
  wetlands occurs as a result of high nitrate and phosphate levels in run-off 
  from agricultural areas. Extensive algal blooms and mats of water hyacinth (Eichornia 
  crassipes) in Sudan are also a result of raised nutrient levels in water bodies. 
  These mats constitute problems for water quality, because they release toxins 
  into the water, cause discolouration and reduce dissolved oxygen levels, thus 
  creating an unsuitable habitat for many beneficial freshwater species, and increasing 
  the costs of water treatment. Land erosion and dam reservoir sedimentation are 
  also identified as major environmental problems in the sub-region. Reservoir 
  sedimentation in Morocco was estimated at 50 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr in 1994, 
  and was expected to reach 100 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr by the onset of the 21st 
  century. The resulting annual loss of storage capacity is equivalent to the 
  annual water requirements for irrigating 6 000 ha of cultivated land (FAO 1995).</p>

<p>Between the Aswan High Dam and Cairo, the Nile River receives domestic wastewater 
  from 43 towns and 1 500 villages, and 35 major factories (with a combined wastewater 
  discharge of 125 m<sup>3</sup>/yr), as well as 2 300 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  of irrigation return flows (containing chemical residues, sediments and nutrients) 
  (Myllyla 1995). The health risks associated with such water quality problems 
  are high, especially for children. In Morocco, the incidence of diarrhoea amongst 
  children is highly correlated to lack of access to treated piped or treated 
  well water (Kelly, Khanfir, David, Arata and Kleinau 1999). Tunisia's largest 
  reservoir, the Sidi Salem, and Algeria's Mitidja and Saida aquifers, are showing 
  deteriorating quality, in particular, elevated nitrate levels originating from 
  industrial effluents and agricultural run-offs (World Bank 1996). This is of 
  particular concern, because these are the main water supplies for the capital 
  of Algeria, Algiers.</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>Special development programmes devoted to enhancing drinking water quality 
  and sanitation services are expected to be in place by 2010 in northern Africa. 
  Implementation has already begun in some areas, such as Cairo, where the gigantic 
  Greater Cairo Wastewater Project was implemented in the 1990s in order to convey 
  and to treat the effluents from 7 million inhabitants of Cairo City. Industrial 
  pollution abatement and pollution prevention programmes were prepared by the 
  Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, and successful prevention of untreated 
  industrial effluent discharge into the Nile River was confirmed by the Ministry 
  of State for Environmental Affairs by 1998. National water monitoring programmes 
  have also been launched by the National Research Centre and the Nile River Institute, 
  but there is lack of coordination in their efforts, and insufficient technical 
  and financial resources are additional barriers. The World Bank (WB) is investing 
  more than US$2 000 million through the GEF for water-related projects in Egypt, 
  and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is another sponsor, 
  funding water supply and sanitation schemes in Cairo (Myllyla 1995). The Egyptian 
  Environmental Affairs Agency has passed a new environmental protection law, 
  and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) will be required for new big industrial 
  developments.</p>
<p>In Tunisia, wastewater management began in the 1970s with the launch of a national 
  water policy, and the establishment of the National Wastewater Management Agency. 
  In recent years, the focus of the National Wastewater Management Agency has 
  been in providing services for rural areas, implementing the State Environmental 
  and Public Health Policy, and maintaining infrastructure related to sewage in 
  urban and industrial areas. Environmental water requirements are considered, 
  and Tunisia is seeking to supplement domestic, industrial and agricultural demands 
  through the reuse of treated wastewater (Citet 2001).</p>
