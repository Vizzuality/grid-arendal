<p><a name="fig2s4"></a>Only Western and Central Africa have abundant resources 
  of closed canopy forests, although Madagascar and the wetter parts of Southern 
  and Eastern Africa have equally important but smaller areas of forest. Savanna 
  and woodlands are predominant in Africa's more arid countries. These ecosystems 
  are very different from closed canopy forests but are also rich in diverse natural 
  resources. Both forests and woodlands play vital roles in supporting national 
  economies and local communities through harvesting of resources, provision of 
  habitats and services derived from the ecosystem. Since the majority of these 
  resources and services have not been quantified in monetary terms, they are 
  often undervalued and threatened by overexploitation.</p>
<p>Africa has the fastest rate of deforestation in the world. Competing land uses 
  (agriculture and human settlements mainly) are contributing to the decline of 
  forest and woodland areas and the rising demand for fuelwood and charcoal is 
  also a major cause of deforestation. In addition to ecological impacts, local 
  communities are suffering from loss of livelihood and from loss of vital energy 
  sources. Although policies and mechanisms for enhancing sustainable use of forests 
  are in place in many countries and regional cooperative arrangements are well 
  under way, implementation and enforcement of regulations are weak because economic 
  forces are pressurizing governments and communities into unsustainable practices 
  for short-term profits. Political commitment to protection of indigenous forests, 
  sustainable harvesting practices and community ownership needs to be strengthened 
  and development of alternative energy sources is a priority. <a href="#fig2s4">Figure 
  2s.4</a> shows the major threats to Africa's forests.<br clear="all">
