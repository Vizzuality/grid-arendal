<h2><a name="img2g7"></a>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>Throughout history, urbanization has been associated with economic and social 
  progress, the promotion of literacy and education, the improvement of the general 
  state of health, greater access to social services, and cultural, political 
  and religious participation. When properly planned and managed, urban areas 
  are capable of promoting human development, whilst effectively managing the 
  extent of their impact on the natural environment.</p>
<p>However, population growth and rural-to-urban migrations have increased steadily, 
  particularly in developing countries, placing enormous pressures on urban infrastructure 
  and services, both in terms of provision and maintenance. The most serious problems 
  confronting cities and towns and their inhabitants include inadequate financial 
  resources, and planning skills and capacities. Coupled with the rapid growth 
  in demand for shelter and services, as well as rising consumption, this has 
  culminated in many social and environmental problems. These factors strain governments 
  and local authorities' budgets, and their capacities to achieve the goals of 
  sustainable development. Responses urgently required include the eradication 
  of rural poverty and improvement of the quality of living conditions, as well 
  as creation of employment and educational opportunities in rural settlements, 
  regional centres and secondary cities (United Nations Conference on Human Settlements 
  1996). Additional resources need to be committed to environmental protection 
  and management at the national and international levels, to ensure a sustained 
  supply of fertile and stable soils, good quality water, healthy fresh air, medicinal 
  and nutritional products, and space for recreation.</p>
<p>Improved planning and design of settlements is required to make use of existing 
  sites, thereby containing urban sprawl and limiting the extent of encroachment 
  on natural habitat or agricultural land. Efforts should also be made to encourage 
  the use of recycled or sustainably produced building materials, and innovations 
  are required in building design to reduce environmental impact (e.g. through 
  improved energy-efficiency). Environmental Impact Assessments need to be better 
  integrated with urban planning and management, so that environmental impacts 
  are monitored and managed continuously and within a context of holistic development.</p>
<p>In addition to this, improvements to infrastructure provision and maintenance 
  are a priority for most African countries, although this is not exclusively 
  an urban issue. A significant proportion of the burden of disease in Africa 
  could be alleviated through improvements in water supply and sanitation, waste 
  disposal, education, and community-based, preventive healthcare. Reducing air 
  pollution in urban centres by regulating the industrial and transport sectors, 
  as well as reducing domestic air pollution through improved access to electricity 
  and ventilation would also make significant inroads in reducing the disease 
  burden in Africa.</p>
<p>'Recognizing the global nature of these issues, the international community, 
  in convening Habitat II, has decided that a concerted global approach could 
  greatly enhance progress towards achieving these goals. Unsustainable patterns 
  of production and consumption, particularly in industrialized countries, environmental 
  degradation, demographic changes, widespread and persistent poverty, and social 
  and economic inequality can have local, cross-national and global impacts. The 
  sooner communities, local governments and partnerships among the public, private 
  and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive, bold and innovative 
  strategies for shelter and human settlements, the better the prospects will 
  be for the safety, health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook 
  for solutions to global environment and social problems.' (United Nations Conference 
  on Human Settlements, 1996).</p>
