<h2>REGIONAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Biological diversity or 'biodiversity' means the variety of plant and animal 
  life at the ecosystem, community or species level, and even at the genetic level. 
  Biodiversity is most commonly measured and reported at species level with characteristics 
  such as species richness (number of species), species diversity (types of species), 
  and endemism (uniqueness of species to a certain area) being the most useful 
  elements for comparison.</p>
<p>Only a fraction of the species inhabiting the earth have been identified and 
  studied to date and the roles they play in influencing the environment are still 
  often poorly understood. Studies have tended to concentrate on higher plants 
  and mammals and such species have also been the focus of most conservation efforts. 
  This can give a misleading impression of the importance of 'lower organisms' 
  such as bacteria, insects, and fungi which play vital ecological roles-for example, 
  in nutrient cycling, and regulation of water, soil and air quality. Lack of 
  understanding of the role of such organisms can lead to their being 'sidelined' 
  when conservation efforts or commercial utilization are being considered. It 
  is worth noting that around 1 million of the 1.75 million species described 
  so far are insects and myriapods, and that the total number of such species 
  is estimated to be around 8 million. In other words, only one-eighth of insect 
  and myriapod species have been identified and recorded to date. It is also estimated 
  that there are 1.5 million species of fungi, of which 72 000 have been described, 
  and 1 million species of bacteria, of which a mere 4 000 have been described 
  (WCMC 2000).</p>

<p><a name="fig2b1"></a>Africa has rich and varied biological resources forming 
  the region's natural wealth on which its social and economic systems are based. 
  These resources also have global importance, for the world's climate and for 
  the development of agriculture or industrial activities such as pharmaceutics, 
  tourism or construction, to name but a few of the most important areas.</p>
<p>Africa is also a continent of extremes, both in terms of physical features 
  and climatic conditions, and therefore in terms of the life it supports. The 
  humid tropical forests of equatorial Africa are among the most productive ecosystems 
  in the world with Net Primary Productivity (NPP)-the net flux of carbon from 
  the atmosphere into green plants-greater than 800 gCarbon/m<sup>2</sup>/yr). They also 
  support an estimated 1.5 million species. By contrast, Africa's arid areas are 
  among the harshest environments in the world. The Sahara and Namib deserts and 
  the Sahel, for example, have NPP of just 100 gCarbon/m<sup>2</sup>/yr (WCMC 2000). But 
  even under these conditions many plant and animal species manage to thrive.</p>
<p>The designation of some areas as 'biodiversity hotspots' is a useful concept 
  developed in recent years as a means of prioritizing habitats for conservation 
  Myers 1990). Hotspots are areas where species diversity and endemism are particularly 
  high and where there is an extraordinary threat of loss of species or habitat. 
  There are 25 internationally recognized hotspots, six of them are in Africa 
  (Mittermeier, Myers, Gil & Mittermeier 2000). These are shown in <a href="#fig2b1">Figure 
  2b.1</a> and are described below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Mediterranean Basin Forests</b> constitute just 1.5 per cent of the 
    world's forests, yet are home to 25 000 plant species and 14 endemic genera 
    (Quézel, Médail, Loisel, & Barbero 1999).</li>
  <li><b>The Western Indian Ocean Islands</b> have extremely high levels of endemism 
    due to their isolation. This is especially true for Madagascar which has the 
    highest number of endemic species in Africa (including 700 endemic vertebrate 
    species), and ranks 6th in the world (UNEP 1999).</li>
  <li><b>The Cape Floristic Region</b>, in South Africa, is the smallest and richest 
    of the world's floral kingdoms with 68 per cent of the 8 700 plant species 
    endemic to the region (Low & Rebelo 1996).</li>
  <li><b>The Succulent Karoo</b>, shared between South Africa and Namibia, is 
    the richest desert in the world-40 per cent of its 4 849 species are endemic 
    (Low & Rebelo 1996).</li>
  <li><b>The Guinean Forest</b> hotspot is a strip of fragmented forest running 
    parallel to the coast of Western Africa through 11 countries from Guinea to 
    Cameroon. It has the highest mammalian diversity of all of the world's 25 
    hotspots (551 species out of the 1 150 mammalian species on the African continent) 
    and contains 2 250 plant species, 90 bird species, 45 mammal species and 46 
    reptile species found nowhere else (Conservation International 2002, Mittermeier 
    and others 2000).</li>
  <li><b>The Eastern Arc Mountain Forests</b> of Eastern Africa are 30 million 
    years old and are thought to have evolved in isolation for at least 10 million 
    years. As a result, more than 25 per cent of the plant species are endemic 
    (Lovett 1998).</li>
</ul>
<p>Africa also has several areas where both species richness and degree of threat 
  are high but endemism is lower. These 'potential hotspots' include the highlands 
  of Ethiopia; the forests of the Albertine Rift in eastern Congo, Rwanda, Burundi 
  and adjacent parts of Uganda and Kenya; the western escarpment of Angola; and 
  the Miombo Woodlands of interior Southern Africa (Mittermeier and others 2000).</p>
<p>Africa also has a range of aquatic habitats with very high levels of biodiversity. 
  Marine ecosystems tend to be more diverse than terrestrial ones and reach even 
  higher levels of diversity in warmer tropical waters than in cooler seas. The 
  coasts of many African countries have rich ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrass 
  meadows, mangrove forests, estuaries and floodplain swamps (Martens 1995). Rivers, 
  lakes (freshwater and soda) and riverine edge swamps, valley swamps, seasonal 
  floodplains, ponds and high altitude peatforming wetlands all contribute to 
  a wide variety of aquatic ecosystems in Africa that support an extensive range 
  of resident as well as migratory species (Harper & Mavuti 1996).</p>
<p>The national and sub-regional boundaries that characterize present day Africa 
  are the result of geographical and human activities often determined by political 
  or economic factors, they therefore seldom reflect the boundaries of ecological 
  systems. This difference between political and ecological units is significant-when 
  the boundaries of ecosystems extend beyond territorial boundaries, the protection 
  of the natural resources within those ecosystems requires management strategies 
  that are coordinated jointly between nations or sub-regions (Westing 1993). 
  The disparities between political and ecological boundaries also imply some 
  overlap in discussion of biological systems in the sub-regions referred to in 
  this report. For example, Tanzania forms part of the Southern African sub-region 
  but shares major ecological systems with Kenya and Uganda. It is therefore discussed 
  in both the Southern Africa and Eastern Africa analyses.</p>
