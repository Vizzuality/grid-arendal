<p>Water stress (less than 1 700 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr) or water scarcity (less 
  than 1 000m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr) is already observed in 14 of the 53 African 
  countries (WRI 2000). The high demand for water is driving unsustainable practices, 
  and competition for water resources between sectors, communities, and nations. 
  On occasion, it has been the cause of strained relations and hostility. For 
  example, in Libya, annual withdrawals of groundwater are more than 500 times 
  the rate of replenishment (UNDP and others 2000). In Egypt, 90 per cent of all 
  freshwater resources are derived from the Nile River and, because this is a 
  shared watercourse with nine other nations, securing access and usage rights 
  has been a contentious process.</p>
<p>With such limited, variable or unevenly distributed freshwater resources in 
  Africa, it is not surprising that access to water is a major factor in social 
  and economic development. Over the past 30 years, the response to this has been 
  to dam or to modify large rivers in order to provide water for agricultural, 
  domestic and industrial use, as well as to supply hydropower (see <a href="#box2e2">Box 
  2e.2</a>). Low investment in water supply and infrastructure maintenance, increasing 
  demand from all sectors and inequitable access policies have added further strain 
  to the situation, resulting in highly skewed access to water resources.</p>

            <p>There are more than 1 200 dams in Africa,more than 60 per cent 
              of which are located in South Africa (539) and Zimbabwe (213).Most 
              of these were constructed during the past 30 years, coincident with 
              rising demands for water from growing populations. The overwhelming 
              majority of dams in Africa have been constructed to facilitate irrigation 
              (52 per cent) and to supply water to municipalities (20 per cent), 
              although almost 20 per cent of dams are multipurpose. Although only 
              6 per cent of dams were built primarily for electricity generation, 
              hydroelectric power accounts for more than 80 per cent of total 
              power generation in 18 African countries, and for more than 50 per 
              cent in 25 countries. Only 1 per cent of African dams have been 
              constructed to provide flooding control.</p>
            <p>Besides providing these benefits and services, however, dams have 
              had several negative impacts, including: large-scale displacement 
              of people; altered patterns of erosion and flooding; loss of land, 
              due to flooding; loss of income from downstream fisheries; and changes 
              to sedimentation rates. These ecological and social concerns - together 
              with additional stresses on water resources, which are expected 
              in many parts of Africa as a result of increasing population pressures 
              and global climate change - are changing attitudes towards large 
              dams. The construction of smaller dams and the development of micro-hydropower 
              facilities are being investigated as more sustainable means of supplying 
              water and power.</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#fig2e3">Figure 2e.3</a>, the major user of freshwater 
  resources is the agricultural sector, which accounted for 63 per cent of all 
  withdrawals in Africa in 1995 (Shiklomanov 1999), and which irrigates more than 
  12 million hectares (ha) of farmland (FAOSTAT 2001). The more arid countries 
  of northern and southern Africa are more dependent on irrigation than those 
  in western and central Africa, however and, thus, securing water for irrigation 
  is a high priority for economic development and stability. However, few countries 
  can afford the financial investment in efficient irrigation systems, and water 
  losses through leaking pipes and evaporation are as high as 50 per cent in South 
  Africa alone (Global Water Partnership 2000). Notable exceptions are Mauritius 
  and northern African countries, where drip irrigation systems are in place and 
  faulty pipes are being replaced. With increasing population and consumption 
  patterns, the demand for food is increasing across Africa, and freshwater withdrawals 
  for agriculture are predicted to rise by more than 30 per cent over the next 
  20 years (Shiklomanov 1999).</p>

<p>Compared to the agricultural sector, the domestic sector in Africa uses little 
  water. However, domestic use has also increased over the past 30 years and is 
  set to continue this trend (see <a href="#fig2e3">Figure 2e.3</a>). In 1950, 
  the domestic sector was responsible for less than 3 per cent of all water withdrawals, 
  but this had risen to 4.4 per cent by 1995, and is predicted to account for 
  6 per cent of all withdrawals by 2025 (Shiklomanov 1999). It is important to 
  note, however, that only 62 per cent of the African population received piped 
  water from municipal sources in 2000 (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Therefore, actual withdrawals 
  for domestic consumption are higher than the estimated percentage from municipal 
  withdrawals. Compared to domestic consumption in other regions of the world, 
  Africa's domestic sector is a moderate user of water. For example, in Europe, 
  the domestic sector accounts for 13 per cent of all withdrawals, more than twice 
  that in Africa (Hinrichsen, Robey and Upadhyay 1997). Per capita usage in Africa 
  (on average 47 litres/person/day) is also far below that of other countries 
  (85 litres/person/day in Asia, 334 litres/person/day in the UK and 578 litres/person/day 
  in the US) (Hinrichsen and others 1997).</p>
<p>There are large differences in access to water between countries, between urban 
  and rural areas, and between population groups. Inadequate water supply and 
  sanitation, particularly in the cramped living conditions of urban informal 
  settlements, increases the risk of waterborne diseases and infections. Diarrhoeal 
  infections are particularly prevalent amongst children, and constitute a major 
  cause of preventable deaths.</p>
<p>Consumption of water consumption also varies, as well as access to water. Typically, 
  the greater the access to water, the greater the consumption. By contrast, people 
  who spend a large proportion of their day fetching and carrying water are most 
  conservative with its use. A study in eastern Africa, for example, showed that 
  urban dwellers use more water than rural households, and households with piped 
  water use more than three times the amount of water used by households without 
  piped water (IIED 2000). In South Africa, extreme disparities exist in water 
  consumption between different population groups, with residents of urban informal 
  settlements using less than 50 litres/person/day, and residents of middle-upper 
  class suburbs consuming 750 litres/person/day-thirteen times more (Napier 2000). 
  Losses from domestic water distribution systems also account for significant 
  wastage, for example, up to 50 per cent of domestic consumption in the case 
  of Mauritius (Government of Mauritius 1994).</p>
