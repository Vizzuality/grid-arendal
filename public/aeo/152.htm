<h4>Improving water quality in Africa</h4>
<p>Measures to control water quality have been implemented in many countries, 
  including: establishment and enforcement of potable water and wastewater standards; 
  and rehabilitation of existing wastewater treatment facilities. The Polluter 
  Pays Principle has been adopted in many policies and legislation, but enforcement 
  has been often hampered by a lack of resources for effective monitoring and 
  prosecution. Other responses include: schemes for improving drainage; purification 
  and decontamination of freshwater systems; and public awareness campaigns. Although 
  only recently implemented, these responses have had localized success in improving 
  access to potable water and raising awareness. Public-private partnerships have 
  also been successful in implementing large urban sanitation projects (Sharma 
  1996).</p>
<p>Increasing water shortages and declining water quality are compounding factors 
  limiting Africa's development. As freshwater availability decreases, it increases 
  the concentration of pollutants, lowering the water quality. And as water quality 
  declines, water shortages are exacerbated, through increased costs of water 
  treatment and increased time spent in collecting water. Therefore, the challenges 
  are: to ensure equitable access to clean water; to manage the demand for water 
  for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes; and maintain healthy ecosystems, 
  in order to ensure sustained supplies of good quality water.</p>
<p>The African Initiative on Land and Water, funded by the Global Environment 
  Facility (GEF), was set up to address in an integrated manner complex environmental 
  challenges impacting on land and water quality. It provides a framework for 
  coordinating bilateral and multilateral funding mechanisms, as well as for harmonizing 
  existing sustainable development initiatives. Thus, a consolidated national 
  and sub-regional sustainable development framework is proposed, in order to 
  control the direct and indirect impacts of land degradation and desertification, 
  including: sedimentation; siltation; and pollution of national and international 
  water bodies. In addition, the benefits accruing from sound environmental management 
  will be equally distributed between stakeholders. A catchmentor watershed-based 
  approach is considered appropriate, taking into account natural environmental 
  variability, in terms of rainfall and biomass production, and linking closely 
  to biodiversity conservation objectives. The initiative will use monitoring 
  and assessment information to support the development of flexible and adaptive 
  policies and management strategies at the catchment or watershed level (UNEP 
  2002).</p>
<p>The following sections provide further information on specific freshwater issues 
  relating to each sub-region in Africa.</p>
