<h3>AIR QUALITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>The Western Indian Ocean Islands are well ventilated and have yet to experience 
  levels of air pollution with lasting effects on ecology and human health. However, 
  concerns are growing about air pollution from industry and transport, especially 
  in Seychelles and Mauritius. Traffic density is increasing alarmingly and the 
  transport sector, the largest energy user in the sub-region as a whole, currently 
  accounts for 43 per cent of total energy consumption. Vehicles also tend to 
  be older-in Madagascar the average age of buses is 11 years, that of cars 7-8 
  years (ONE 1997). In Mauritius, urban pollution, caused largely by vehicle exhaust 
  emission, often exceeds WHO guidelines (UNEP 1999). Government subsidies for 
  public transport and import duties on vehicles have failed to stem the growth 
  in numbers of private vehicles and have resulted in a fleet that is increasing 
  both in age and inefficiency. Lack of policies and of incentives to use cleaner 
  fuels has also added to the burden of pollution.</p>
<p>Increasing disposable income in the sub-region will continue to drive up both 
  energy use and numbers of vehicles. In Mauritius, for example, accelerated industrial 
  development has resulted in increased industrial emissions and commercial road 
  traffic, even though the capital, Port Louis, escapes concentrations of urban 
  pollution because of its coastal position. In Madagascar, more than 70 per cent 
  of industrial enterprises-principally agro-processing, textiles, clothing, leather, 
  wood, paper, chemicals, mineral and metal products and industrial boilers-are 
  located around the capital, Antananarivo, causing pollution problems. Air quality 
  and pollution in Antananarivo are also influenced by strong sunshine and an 
  absence of air movement, putting additional pressure on human respiratory health 
  (ONE 1997).</p>
<p>The domestic use of wood and charcoal for cooking is causing concern over air 
  pollution in Comoros and Madagascar (UNEP 1999). In Mauritius, where this problem 
  also exists, its impacts are compounded by cigarette consumption which is at 
  significant levels among males (UNDP 2000).</p>
<p>The practice of burning sugar cane before harvesting, in Mauritius and elsewhere 
  in the sub-region, causes severe, though often localized, air pollution with 
  release of fly ash, ozone, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and volatile 
  organic compounds. Pollutants such as these can have an impact on respiratory 
  health and can acidify ecosystems thereby affecting the quality of soil, land 
  and water.</p>
<p>The sub-region has no heavy, power-intensive industrial sector, but odours 
  from the fish processing industry are a source of complaint.</p>
<p>Environmental quality is the key factor on which the sub-region's tourism and 
  other inward investment depend. The main priority is therefore to avoid further 
  deterioration of air quality and to reduce current sources of pollution.</p>
<h4>Towards improving air quality in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>Even though natural ventilation in these islands disperses much of the pollution, 
  there is still a need for additional control measures. Some steps have been 
  taken, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitoring of pollution along main roads and the introduction of public 
    awareness and school programmes highlighting the risks of air pollution to 
    the environment and to human health.</li>
  <li>Use of some renewable energy sources including hydro-electricity in Madagascar 
    and Mauritius and solar power in most countries of the sub-region. Bagasse 
    from sugar cane is used to produce electricity in Mauritius (UNEP 1999).</li>
  <li>Environmental protection legislation is in place in each country, but its 
    application is at the 'educational' rather than the enforcement stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, establishing the nature of the problem in the sub-region and quantifying 
  it are difficult because monitoring tools are inadequate. In addition, control 
  of sources of pollution is weak and there is a general laxness in regulation 
  of the industrial sector. Social costs and impacts on health have not been studied, 
  public sensitivity to environmental issues has yet to be stimulated and the 
  sub-region is characterized by a general lack of awareness of the threats to 
  the ecology and to human health.</p>
