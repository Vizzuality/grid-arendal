<h3>FOREST COVER AND QUALITY IN NORTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>It is believed that much more of Northern Africa had forest cover originally, 
  and that this has declined over several centuries because of climatic conditions 
  and human intervention (CAMRE/UNEP/ACSAD 1996, Gilani 1997, Thirgood 1981 & 
  AOAD 1998). However, only Sudan has experienced deforestation over the last 
  decade, losing 10 million hectares of forest since 1990 (an average of 1.4 per 
  cent of its forest per year) (FAO 2001a). By contrast, other countries have 
  increased the extent of their forests and woodlands, mainly through establishment 
  of plantations. Egypt has experienced the greatest increase-3.3 per cent per 
  year (FAO 2001a).</p>
<p>The pressures resulting in loss of forest and wooded vegetation include extensive 
  land clearing for human settlements and agricultural activities, overgrazing 
  by livestock, overcollection of fuelwood and charcoal production. Frequent natural 
  and man-made fires in the Mediterranean and tropical areas of the subregion 
  have also contributed to the reduction of natural forests, and degraded the 
  soils that support them, enhancing the desertification process.</p>
<p>The growth in Northern Africa's population has also increased the demand for 
  forest products for energy and various domestic uses in the sub-region, especially 
  charcoal manufacture. Although the majority of the subregion's energy needs 
  are met through electricity generated by burning of fossil fuels, fuelwood and 
  charcoal are still vital sources of energy, especially for the poor. Five per 
  cent of all energy consumed in Northern Africa comes from biomass (compared 
  to 86 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa), and total fuelwood use is currently 58 
  million m<sup>3</sup> per year, predicted to increase by 20 per cent over the 
  next 30 years (EIA 1999, FAO 2001b). </p>
<p>In the Maghreb countries, forests and wooded vegetation in uplands and on slopes 
  play an important role in land stabilization, erosion control and regulation 
  of hydrological flow. However, deforestation in these areas has resulted in 
  increased flooding, erosion, desertification, and siltation of dams (FAO 1997). 
  Recently the construction of roads, quarrying and mining industries, and building 
  of dams and irrigation canals have fragmented remaining forest cover, leading 
  to losses of biodiversity. In addition, mass tourism has increased in forest 
  areas over the last 10 years, contributing to opening of forest canopies and 
  disturbing natural processes and wildlife.</p>
<p>Large areas of the sub-region have also become infested or replaced by exotic 
  species, introduced intentionally or accidentally. Other factors contributing 
  to the decline in forest area and quality in Northern Africa include: ambiguity 
  as to ownership; lack of technical personnel for research, monitoring, and enforcement 
  of protection regulations; and lack of financial resources and development techniques.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable management and conservation of forests and woodlands in 
  Northern Africa</h4>
<p>Concerns about forest deterioration are reflected in the substantial afforestation 
  and reforestation programmes and various local level measures that have been 
  introduced recently to protect and increase forest areas (see <a href="#box2d3">Box 
  2d.3</a>). The main method used by countries in extending their forests and 
  wooded areas has been planting of forest plantations with the aims of stabilizing 
  sand-dunes, rehabilitating range and steppe areas, managing water catchments, 
  and protecting agricultural areas (FAO 1993). Morocco has large <i>eucalyptus 
  </i>plantations (219 000 hectares), and coniferous (59 400 hectares) and dune 
  fixing plantations (247 500 hectares). By 1990, the multipurpose green belt 
  plantations in Algeria had mobilized a vast range of forest resources covering 
  more than 150 000 hectares. Tunisia has reforested more than 312 000 hectares 
  and has modernized its forest tree nurseries (Lamhamedi, Ammari, Fecteau, Fortin 
  & Margolis 2000) and Egypt has planted about 34 000 hectares of trees. Forest 
  plantation efforts in these countries have, however, not been able to compensate 
  for the loss of natural forests (FAO 1996 & 1997).</p>

            <p>Commercial opportunities for cultivation of medicinal forest plants 
              in nurseries are being realized in several countries. In Egypt three 
              large nurseries and 20 small ones have been established in cooperation 
              with local Bedouins, and have played a significant role in decreasing 
              the collection of medicinal plants from the wild.</p>
            <p>The Tree Lovers Association (TLA) in Cairo has been instrumental 
              in raising awareness and protection of the Wadi Degla area, a desert 
              valley of outstanding beauty and biological diversity. In collaboration 
              with the governmental agencies, a local women's group has created 
              a steering committee for managing the park, including measures to 
              guard against further removal of woody vegetation. The Mediterranean 
              coast countries are also expected to establish a policy of replanting, 
              improving forestry management conditions, integrating trees in urban 
              and tourism developments, and establishing conservation areas.</p>

<p>Forest reserves have been set up in some countries, ranging from 19 per cent 
  in Libya to 4 per cent in Tunisia (Egypt does not have natural forests, only 
  plantations) (FAO 2001a). Sustainable forest management has been adopted and 
  is being implemented by all countries in the sub-region, through the Near East 
  and Dry Zone Africa processes in the case of Sudan (FAO 2001a). Although forest 
  legislation has been in place in most of the countries of Northern Africa since 
  the nineteenth century, loopholes in the laws and lack of enforcement have limited 
  its effectiveness in terms of protecting forests and wildlife resources (FAO 
  1999). The situation is made more complicated by ambiguity regarding ownership, 
  lack of technical personnel and agricultural extension services, lack of financial 
  resources and development techniques, poor forest management, underlying market 
  and policy failures of forest resource pricing, and trade policies.</p>
<p>Reforestation and afforestation programmes are an essential part of environmental 
  management in such an arid environment, and should be priorities for the next 
  decade, as they will prevent or slow the rate of soil erosion, and will provide 
  considerable benefits in terms of soil and water quality regulation.</p>
