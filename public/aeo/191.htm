<h3>LAND QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>One of the challenges facing southern Africa is to feed the growing population 
  through increased agricultural production. Such production pressures have led 
  to resources being overexploited, and vegetation and soil degradation is a major 
  concern. Studies indicate that more than 50 per cent of southern Africa's land 
  degradation is caused by overgrazing from cattle, sheep and goats, some of which 
  are bred in unsuitable areas (UNEP 1999a). The timing and density of stocking 
  affect the productivity of grazing land, particularly in areas where rainfall 
  is limited or variable (Erskine 1987). Drought is a further contributing factor, 
  as is the land tenure type, because traditional communal access grazing systems 
  have conflicted with commercial production pressures, population growth, and 
  colonial and post-colonial tenure systems, resulting in less willingness to 
  share input costs, and greater incentives to exploit land for individual gains. 
  Because the extent of suitable land is limited, there is increasing pressure 
  to open up forests for grazing land and irrigation, and to cultivate marginal 
  lands-a situation which exacerbates land degradation. Deforestation rates in 
  the region average 0.5 per cent per year (equivalent to the loss of 13 000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  per year), mainly due to the expansion in agricultural land (World Bank 2000b). 
  Removal of vegetation cover, poor agricultural practices, loss of wetlands and 
  overgrazing are mainly responsible for increasingly dramatic impacts of flooding 
  in southern Africa in recent years (UNDHA 1994).</p>

<p><a name="img2f6"></a>Some of the visible manifestations of land degradation 
  in southern Africa include: rapid soil erosion; declining crop yields; siltation 
  of rivers and reservoirs; and deterioration of grazing lands. In Zambia, for 
  example, it is estimated that the country loses 3 million tonnes per year (t/yr) 
  of topsoil from cultivated land while, in Swaziland, the rate of soil loss is 
  50 000 (t/yr) and, in South Africa, it is between 300-400 million (t/yr) (Chenje 
  and Johnson 1994). Knock-on effects of vegetation and soil loss include: changes 
  in the abundance and diversity of species; and impaired water quality and air 
  quality regulation.</p>
<p>Declining soil fertility is largely brought about by continuous cultivation 
  without the application of fertilizer or manure. Fertilizer use in the sub-region 
  has increased for some countries whilst, for others, the removal of government 
  subsidies has lead to increasing costs of fertilizers and, thus, their use is 
  declining. Many farmers can no longer afford them, or apply suboptimal amounts 
  and, therefore, soil fertility further declines.</p>
<h4>Improving land quality and productivity in Southern Africa</h4>
<p>There have been a number of responses in southern Africa to combat loss of 
  vegetation cover and soil fertility, and to rehabilitate land resources. Some 
  of the programmes are in the form of community-based natural resources management 
  projects (CBNRM), or of district and national environmental action plans or 
  biodiversity strategy action plans, under the auspices of regional and international 
  conventions. For example, the SADC has established an erosion hazard mapping 
  programme, aimed at defining seriously affected areas, as well as assisting 
  in the design of appropriate conservation strategies, by providing guidance 
  in regional planning, environmental monitoring and land utilization programmes. 
  The SADC also produced a Sub- Regional Action Programme to Combat Desertification 
  in southern Africa, in line with UNCCD. All the countries of southern Africa 
  are party to this convention, and Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe 
  have also produced National Action Plans (UNCCD 2001). The sub-regional action 
  plan also identifies priority issues to be dealt with in curbing desertification, 
  including strengthening of early warning systems and the development of alternative 
  sources of energy (Chenje 2000). An environment education programme aimed at 
  establishing an SADC network for environmental education is also being implemented, 
  with support from international donors. The Regional Environmental Education 
  Centre coordinates the activities, which include the development of environmental 
  education policy, and training of trainers.</p>
<p>Following the Inter-African Conference on Soil Conservation and Land Utilization 
  in Goma (Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1948, several regional committees 
  for the conservation and utilization of soil have been established, including 
  the Southern African Regional Commission for the Conservation and Utilisation 
  of the Soil (SARCCUS). Through the Subcommittee for Land-use Planning and Erosion 
  Control, SARCCUS drew the attention of its member countries to negligible levels 
  of soil conservation in the region. In 1974, soil erosion surveys were undertaken 
  throughout southern Africa. However, owing to a lack of a standard procedure 
  meeting the specific needs of the region, no overall assessment of the soil 
  erosion situation was carried out. Following several attempts over a long period, 
  a classification system eventually materialized, with several countries participating, 
  culminating in a meeting in Gaborone in 1981 (SARCCUS 1981).</p>
