<h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
<h4>HUMAN VULNERABILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</h4>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Three decades ago, in 1972, the international community adopted the Stockholm 
  Declaration, following the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. Principle 
  1 of the Declaration highlighted a healthy environment as a fundamental human 
  right, explicitly stating: 'Man [sic] has the fundamental right to freedom, 
  equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of a quality that 
  permits a life of dignity and well-being, and he bears a solemn responsibility 
  to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations...' 
  Since then, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) African Charter on Human 
  and People's Rights, and dozens of relatively new African national constitutions, 
  have enshrined a healthy environment as a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to Africa in the Stockholm Declaration was the condemnation 
  in Principle 1 of apartheid, racial segregation, discrimination, colonial and 
  other forms of oppression, and foreign domination. While these socio-political 
  issues have virtually been eliminated in the region, the environmental objectives 
  have been compromised in many ways.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the environment in Africa has continued to deteriorate, 
  resulting in environmental change which is making more and more people in the 
  region vulnerable due to increased risk and inadequate coping capability. Such 
  deterioration has been acknowledged at various fora, and the World Commission 
  on Environment and Development (WCED) reported in 1987: 'Today, many regions 
  face risks of irreversible damage to the human environment that threaten the 
  basis for human progress' (WCED 1987).</p>
<p>The undervaluing of the environment is a major factor in terms of overexploitation 
  of the environment (see <a href="#box31">Box 3.1</a>).</p>

            <p>The advocates of sustainable development have not yet succeeded 
              in raising environmental concerns to a high priority in all countries. 
              The perception remains in some quarters that environmental protection 
              is something that can and should be addressed only when a country 
              is rich enough to do so, and that it is a 'low rate of return' activity.Yet 
              the evidence is mounting that local environmental destruction can 
              accelerate the poverty spiral not only for future generations, but 
              even for today's population. It is obvious that countries which 
              recklessly deplete their natural resources are destroying the basis 
              of prosperity for future generations, but few policy makers have 
              been able to persuade their constituents that, as forests disappear 
              and water is exhausted or polluted, it is the poor of today, especially 
              children and women, who suffer most.</p>

<p>Human vulnerability to environmental change is complex; it may, in fact, be 
  as complex as ecological processes, where some cause and effect linkages are 
  still not fully understood despite centuries of scientific research. Human vulnerability 
  to environmental change has global, local, social and economic dimensions. It 
  is not synonymous with disasters, even though such events generate more public 
  awareness and response, and media interest (see <a href="#box32">Box 3.2</a>).</p>

            <p>Sofia Pedro made world headlines in March 2000 when she gave birth 
              to a daughter in a tree as the furious and raging waters of the 
              flooded Limpopo River gushed below, laying to waste surrounding 
              areas and devastating the lives of hundreds of thousands of her 
              Mozambican compatriots. The Mozambican floods killed 700 people 
              and left millions more homeless.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the birth of Sofia Pedro's daughter-Rosita Pedro-brought 
              to reality the juxtaposition of the birth of a new human life and 
              the death of others, and the struggle humanity faces today in dealing 
              with the challenges of a merciless, changed environment whose devastation 
              grows in intensity and impact. Often, the impact of episodes such 
              as the Mozambican floods in early 2000 is hidden behind a string 
              of statistics: the number of confirmed deaths, the numbers injured, 
              the livelihoods lost, the infrastructure destroyed, the habitats 
              lost and the damage caused. As the news headlines bombard people 
              with such figures, the human face is lost, reducing people to a 
              footnote of another disaster event.</p>
            <p>However, Sofia Pedro refused to be a footnote of that devastating 
              episode of nature in Mozambique, but a living symbol of the human 
              spirit and resilience in the storm of an increasingly unforgiving 
              hostile environment, which has changed dramatically over the past 
              three decades. In those swift-flowing muddy waters below her were 
              many people who were not so lucky. There were also deadly snakes, 
              wild animals, livestock, and tonnes of soil on which millions of 
              people in the Limpopo River basin depended for agriculture and food 
              security. A way of life was swept away to the Indian Ocean to be 
              drowned under masses of water. Left behind was human misery and 
              people whose resilience had been compromised.</p>
            <p>Sofia Pedro's story not only exemplifies just how people have become 
              more vulnerable to environmental change, but also that ultimately 
              disasters have the greatest impact on the personal level. Her story 
              has been played out countless times since time immemorial in different 
              regions, countries, communities and homes. Many Sofia Pedros have 
              been rescued in floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and avalanches-but 
              even more have perished and continue to do so. The threats to human 
              life today lurk in sudden and intense events such as earthquakes 
              and landslides, and also in more insidious and slow-setting events 
              such as droughts, ozone layer depletion and global warming.</p>
            <p>Long after the devastation of the Mozambican floods, Sofia Pedro's 
              story lingers in the mind-a constant reference point not only of 
              the fury of a river in flood, but also of the increased frequency 
              and intensity with which the environment can unleash such terror.</p>
