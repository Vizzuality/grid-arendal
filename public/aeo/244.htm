<h3>HEALTH</h3>
<p>Environmental damage-whether it is water or air pollution, or waste and sanitation-has 
  serious consequences for human health. Generally, most countries in Africa face 
  high environmental threats to health (WRI and others, 1999), a situation which 
  poses a profound challenge to the region.</p>
<p>Pollution of water and air, and their impact on human health, is of immediate 
  concern. Water pollution and contamination impact on people in the region, resulting 
  in the predominance of water-borne diseases. Air pollution-from industrial and 
  car exhaust emissions, and the burning of traditional fuels in homes-kills a 
  large number of people each year. People die from respiratory damage, heart 
  and lung diseases, and cancer. Urban air pollution causes close to 1 million 
  premature deaths worldwide every year, primarily due to respiratory diseases 
  (World Bank 2000e) affecting mostly the poor. About 4 million people die annually 
  due to overcrowding, and from indoor pollution caused by burning biomass fuels 
  for cooking and heating (WRI 1998). As many as 25 million poor agricultural 
  workers in the developing world (11 million in Africa alone) are poisoned by 
  pesticides every year, and hundreds of thousands die.</p>
<p>In Africa, human vulnerability is exacerbated by poor health caused by unmitigated 
  or heightened exposure to disease, malnourishment and undernourishment, and 
  weak public health institutions and interventions. Linked to this is poverty 
  and the coping capacities of the population at risk to effectively reduce their 
  vulnerability to infectious diseases, poor or irregular nutrition, and the myriad 
  of health conditions that are associated with poverty in urban and rural areas. 
  The survival indices which are a reflection of the general health situation 
  in Africa are summarized in <a href="#tab33">Table 3.3</a>.</p>

<p>Poor health, lack of or inadequate access to health services, low or skewed 
  investment in health services (concentration in few urban centres) and dysfunctional 
  health policies all contribute to lower life expectancy and high mortality rates 
  in African countries, as indicated in the table. Health-related interventions 
  may also contribute to vulnerability by, for example, contributing to the evolution 
  of drug-resistant organisms, or by exposing food webs and people, through the 
  process of bioaccumulation, to toxins such as DDT.</p>

<a name="img37"></a>The effects of infectious diseases-such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis 
and malaria-are felt throughout society and, if unchecked, they damage the social 
fabric of the community, diminish agricultural and industrial production, undermine 
political, social and economic stability, and contribute to regional and global 
insecurity (WHO 2000a). The linkages between environmental change, poverty, reduced 
quality of health and vulnerability are complex, and their individual impacts 
and causal effects are not easy to isolate. However, the lack of scientifically 
proven evidence of such causal changes in Africa does not mean that these changes 
do not exist; rather, it may reflect the lack of available epidemiological data 
as a result of poor or absent surveillance and health information systems (IPCC 
1998). There is, consequently, a pressing need for scientific investigation on 
the assumptions about environmental change and its impacts on human health and 
vulnerability. 
<p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic has spread with devastating speed. It is among the leading 
  causes of death in sub- Saharan Africa (World Bank 2001), where 2.4 million 
  adults and children are estimated to have died due to HIV/AIDS in 2000 alone 
  (UNAIDS/WHO 2000). The HIV/AIDS epidemic is not only the most significant public 
  health problem affecting large parts of sub-Saharan Africa; it is also an unprecedented 
  threat to the region's development (World Bank 2000c). More than 95 per cent 
  of the 36 million people in the world living with HIV/AIDS are in developing 
  countries, and 25.3 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank/UNAIDS 
  2001, UNAIDS/WHO 2000). In Africa, HIV/AIDS is largely a rural/urban poor issue, 
  where a matrix of socioeconomic, cultural and gender-related vulnerabilities 
  indicate that the links between AIDS, food insecurity and poverty are strong 
  and deadly (FAO undated).</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS is a threat to sustainable agriculture and rural development through 
  its systemic impact (FAO/UNAIDS 1999). At the household level, HIV/AIDS can 
  result in labour shortages and declining productivity, reduced income, increased 
  expenditure on medical treatments and an increase in the dependency ratio due 
  to the rise in the number of dependents relying on a smaller number of productive 
  family members. Smallholder agriculture is a vital sector for rural households 
  and national economies in many African countries. HIV/AIDS is affecting agricultural 
  production through the decimation of household labour, the disruption of traditional 
  social mechanisms, and the forced disposal of productive assets to meet the 
  costs of medical care and funerals. The disease also results in the loss of 
  traditional farming methods, inter-generational knowledge, and specialized skills, 
  practices and customs.</p>
