<h2>EASTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Eastern Africa experiences high variability in rainfall over time and space, 
  including frequent episodes of flooding or drought. There is also competition 
  for access to water resources between user groups and between countries. Some 
  of the countries are not only dependent on freshwater for domestic, agricultural 
  and industrial consumption, but also for hydropower generation. Hence, freshwater 
  availability and access is a priority issue for the sub-region. Concerns have 
  been raised in recent years about declining water quality and, in particular, 
  about the infestation of Lake Victoria with water hyacinth (<i>Eichornia crassipes</i>).</p>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER IN EASTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Eastern Africa, on the whole, is fairly well endowed with freshwater, with 
  total average renewable freshwater resources amounting to 187 km<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  (UNDP and others 2000). Uganda has the largest share of this, with 39 km<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  (1 791 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr), whilst Eritrea has the least, with 2.8 km<sup>3</sup>/yr 
  (data on per capita resources are not available) (UNDP and others 2000). The 
  amount and distribution of rainfall varies across Eastern Africa, with annual 
  averages ranging from 147 mm for Djibouti to more than 1 000 mm for Uganda, 
  Rwanda and Burundi (FAOSTAT 2000). Intra-annual variations are also high, ranging 
  from: 50-300 mm for Djibouti; 250-700 mm for Somalia; 750-2000 mm for Uganda; 
  and 100-2 400 mm for Ethiopia (FAOSTAT 2000). These intra-annual variations 
  determine, to some extent, water availability. For example, more than 75 per 
  cent of Ethiopia's rainfall occurs in intense downpours over a period of 3-4 
  months, whilst conditions are relatively dry for the rest of the year (Ministry 
  of Water Resources 1998). The intensity of these rains and the lack of vegetative 
  cover cause most rainfall to be lost as run-off or evaporation, with only a 
  small percentage available to recharge underground aquifers. Surface water, 
  therefore, dominates freshwater resources in easter Africa (the groundwater 
  resources of Ethiopia and Eritrea, for example, are just 2.6 km<sup>3</sup> 
  of the total resources for these countries) (FAOSTAT 1996). Surface water resources 
  are also important in power generation (see <a href="#box2e4">Box 2e.4</a>).</p>

            <p>The world's largest storage dam is the Owen Falls Dam on the River 
              Nile in Uganda. The 162-megawatt (MW) capacity hydroelectric station 
              at the dam supplies most of Uganda's electricity requirements, and 
              exports 30 MW each year to Kenya. In 1999, however, increased domestic 
              demand in Uganda resulted in a drop in supply to Kenya. Kenya's 
              own hydropower stations supply 78 per cent of the country's electricity 
              (670 MW in 1999). Ethiopia's hydropower potential has been estimated 
              at 15 000-30 000 MW, although less than 2 per cent of this had been 
              exploited by 1993, and 90 per cent of all energy consumed is derived 
              from biomass.With such dependency on hydroelectric power, the eastern 
              African countries are vulnerable to power shortages during times 
              of low rainfall, as experienced during 1999 and 2000 by Kenya and 
              Ethiopia. This, in turn, adversely impacts on the economy, as a 
              result of losses in industrial productivity, commercial activities, 
              and transport and communication networks. The government of Kenya 
              is subsequently promoting the development of diesel and geothermal 
              power plants.</p>

<p>The drier countries in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia) frequently 
  experience drought, and have been devastated by drought-induced famine on several 
  occasions over the past 30 years. The largest freshwater source in eastern Africa 
  is Lake Victoria, the second largest lake in the world. Lake Victoria provides 
  freshwater to the populations of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania directly and, through 
  the Nile River, to Sudan and Egypt. It is also the life and livelihood support 
  of millions of people living around the lake, providing: fish; irrigation water; 
  tourism and recreation; communications; and transport. Other major freshwater 
  lakes in eastern Africa include: Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania; Lake Edward, Lake 
  George, Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert in Uganda; Lake Turkana in Kenya; and eleven 
  freshwater lakes in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Annual freshwater withdrawals are a small percentage of the total available, 
  ranging from less than 3 per cent of the total resources available in Burundi 
  to 12 per cent in Rwanda (UNDP 2000). However, variability in rainfall results 
  in frequent bouts of water scarcity and, during these times, demand exceeds 
  supply. Human settlement patterns also influence, and are influenced by, freshwater 
  availability. For example, in Kenya only 33 per cent of the land area has adequate 
  and dependable water, but this area is home to 70 per cent of the population.</p>

<a name="fig2e7"></a>With Eastern Africa's population growing rapidly, demand 
for freshwater is already becoming a problem. <a href="#fig2e7">Figure 2e.7</a> 
shows the current and expected sectoral water use for eastern Africa. Demand for 
freshwater in the domestic sector is also rising because of increasing per capita 
water usage. In 1980, per capita urban water usage in Uganda was 90 litres/day; 
and this was expected to almost double by the year 2000 (NEMA 1999).Eastern Africa 
is home to a sizeable population of pastoralists. One of the main environmental 
problems associated with pastoralism is overstocking of animals, leading to depletion 
of drinking water sources and degradation of vegetation. Currently, Uganda's livestock 
freshwater demand is reported to be 81 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr, and is projected 
to increase to 233 million m<sup>3</sup>/yr by 2010 (NEMA 1999). Compounded by 
increasing demand from the domestic sector, this will present huge challenges 
to water resources management and water supply services. In addition, more land 
is being brought under cultivation in many countries, as part of strategies to 
increase food production and security. Ethiopia's potentially irrigable land area 
is 3.7 million ha, of which only 160,000 ha have been developed (Ministry of Water 
Resources 1998). Ethiopia is considering expanding irrigation activities into 
the Shebelle and Genale river valleys, with some of the irrigation plans also 
calling for diversion of streams. This could have adverse effects on downstream 
water users, and could potentially disrupt hydrological systems and aquatic ecosystem 
health. 
<p>IPCC predicts that rainfall will decrease in the already arid areas of the 
  Horn of Africa, and that drought and desertification will become more widespread 
  (IPCC 2001). As a result of the increasing scarcity of surface freshwater, groundwater 
  aquifers are being mined. Wetlands areas are also being used to obtain water 
  for humans and livestock, and as additional cultivation and grazing land. This 
  alters hydrological cycles, leaving the surrounding area more prone to flooding.</p>
