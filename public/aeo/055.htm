<h3>AIR QUALITY IN CENTRAL AFRICA</h3>
<p>There have been few studies of the ecological impacts of air pollution in Central 
  Africa, as emission levels are generally low. However, generic studies of urban 
  air quality have linked pollutants arising from domestic combustion of traditional 
  fuels to increased rates of respiratory diseases, particularly among children. 
  Industrial emissions, although currently below international averages, must 
  be considered a potential threat as the needs of economic development continue 
  to exert a pressure for greater industrial output. Of particular concern are 
  the extensive oil and gas reserves in the sub-region which could be exploited 
  for domestic energy production and export to other regions. Exploitation would 
  involve clearing of forests and disturbance of marine ecosystems, as well as 
  considerable increases in the sub-region's GHG emissions.</p>
<h4>Towards improving air quality in Central Africa</h4>
<p>It is clear that cleaner technologies are required urgently if Central Africa 
  is to meet its energy requirements and satisfy its economic development needs 
  without increasing pressure on the environment and human health. The sub-region 
  has abundant renewable energy resources including solar, hydro, and wind which 
  have not yet been fully exploited. The transport sector consumes the greatest 
  proportion of energy and strategies for improving fuel efficiency of vehicles 
  and public transport systems are therefore priorities for action. The World 
  Bank's Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Programme, launched in 1998, provides 
  a framework for phasing out leaded fuel and improving transport infrastructure. 
  It could be instrumental in improving air quality in Central African countries.</p>
