<h4>Towards improving air quality in Africa</h4>
<p>Recent responses to try to improve air quality in Africa include the establishment 
  of air quality standards and guidelines and monitoring of ambient air quality. 
  In addition to promulgation of laws and standards, the 'polluter pays principle', 
  which advocates fines for companies exceeding certain emission levels, has been 
  adopted, in theory, by many African governments. However, most countries lack 
  the capacity and resources to enforce regulations or to enter into lengthy and 
  costly legal proceedings with offenders.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Air Pollution Impact Network for Africa (APINA) convened a meeting 
  to discuss the prevention and control of transboundary air pollution. APINA 
  is a network of scientists, policy makers and NGOs established to provide information 
  on air pollution, methodologies and databases, and to bridge the gap between 
  information and policy making. It also provides training courses and workshops 
  with specific groups such as the mining sector. Both APINA and NGOs have been 
  instrumental in promoting the use of more efficient stoves, although with mixed 
  results.</p>
<p>The City of Cairo, where only unleaded fuel has been sold since 1997, is a 
  notable exception to the general use of leaded fuel in Africa. Other urban centres 
  in Egypt are scheduled to follow suit by 2002. Some countries are upgrading 
  public transport systems and have imposed age limits on private and commercial 
  vehicles or are subsidizing the conversion to unleaded fuels. The World Bank's 
  Clean Air Initiative in sub-Saharan African Cities is one such programme, involving 
  phasing out of leaded petrol, and revision of transport policies. Responses 
  to address traffic congestion have included upgrading of roads and incentives 
  for car-share schemes.</p>
<p>Adoption of cleaner technologies to reduce industrial emissions is planned 
  in most parts of Africa, but has, until now, been too expensive to adopt. With 
  funding under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, cleaner technologies should become 
  more widely accessible to African countries.</p>
