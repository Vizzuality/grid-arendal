<p><a name="img2e2"></a>One of several international efforts to improve access 
  to drinking water was the United Nations International Drinking Water Supply 
  and Sanitation Decade (1981-90). This initiative was approved at the United 
  Nations Water Conference in Argentina in 1977, following recommendations that 
  governments 'develop national plans and programmes for community water supply 
  and sanitation' and that 'national development policies and plans should give 
  priority to the supply of drinking water for the entire population and to the 
  final disposal of wastewater' (United Nations Mar del Plata Plan of Action 1977). 
  However, population growth and the proliferation of unplanned settlements in 
  Africa negated much of the progress and, by 1990, only marginal improvements 
  had been made (WHO/UNICEF 2000). In the following decade (1991-2000), some of 
  these gains had been lost (WHO/UNICEF 2000). The World Health Organization's 
  (WHO) Africa Regional Office developed an Africa 2000 initiative in 1994. This 
  is an international effort to expand water supply and sanitation services in 
  Africa, through changing attitudes towards water and sanitation development. 
  At the second regional consultation of African Health Ministers in 1998, recommendations 
  were made for expanding the Africa 2000 initiative, on the strength of results 
  achieved so far.</p>
<p>In the coming decades, major revisions to water policies and pricing in Africa 
  are required. In the semiarid countries of northern and southern Africa, these 
  are immediate priorities, if the additional stresses of climate change and population 
  growth are to be offset. Until recently, there have been few attempts at demand 
  management. On the contrary, water sector policies have focused on meeting increasing 
  demand, as a means of encouraging economic and social development. However, 
  some countries have revised their water policies and pricing mechanisms, as 
  measures to manage demand and to encourage more conservative water use. Recycling 
  of wastewater as irrigation water, and upgrading of reticulation networks, are 
  other vital measures which are in place in some countries. Africa's Water Vision-developed 
  through consultative processes in 1999 and 2000, and presented at the 2nd World 
  Water Forum in The Hague in 2000-stresses the need to change attitudes towards 
  water supply and use, and proposes a framework for building on these achievements 
  to date. The ten key elements of Africa's Water Vision are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is sustainable access to safe and adequate water supply and sanitation 
    in order to meet the basic needs of all.</li>
  <li>There is sufficient water for food and energy security.</li>
  <li>Water for sustaining ecosystems and biodiversity is adequate in both quantity 
    and quality.</li>
  <li>Water resources institutions have been reformed, in order to create an enabling 
    environment for the effective and integrated management of water in national 
    and transboundary water basins, including management at the lowest appropriate 
    level.</li>
  <li>basins serve as a basis for regional cooperation and development, and are 
    treated as natural assets for all within such basins.</li>
  <li>There is an adequate number of motivated and highly skilled water professionals.</li>
  <li>There is an effective and financially sustainable system for data collection, 
    assessment and dissemination for national and transboundary water basins.</li>
  <li>There are effective and sustainable strategies for addressing natural and 
    human-made water resources problems, including climate variability and change.</li>
  <li>Water is financed and priced to promote equity, efficiency, and sustainability.</li>
  <li>There is political will, public awareness and commitment among all for sustainable 
    water resources management, including the mainstreaming of gender issues and 
    youth concerns, and the use of participatory approaches (World Water Council 
    2000).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="img2e1"></a>The proposed mechanism for attaining Africa's Water Vision 
  is comprised of four key components, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>strengthening governance of water resources;</li>
  <li>improving our understanding of water-related issues;</li>
  <li>meeting urgent water needs; and</li>
  <li>providing financial resources for the development and management of water 
    resources in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Africa's Water Vision stresses the need for enhanced regional cooperation, 
  and for a new model for water resources management (World Water Council 2000).</p>
<p>The significant movement towards Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) 
  in several countries is, in part, a reflection of the thinking consolidated 
  in Africa's Water Vision. The principles of IWRM include the management of water 
  resources at the basin level, rather than within politically defined boundaries, 
  and with all stakeholder groups having roles and responsibilities in managing 
  the resource. This integrated approach also ensures that social, economic, environmental 
  and technical considerations are taken into account in the management and development 
  of water resources.</p>
<p>Public-private partnerships in water resources management and water supply 
  programmes are also gaining popularity in many countries, as a means for ensuring 
  a sustained supply and development of infrastructure. Such partnerships have 
  been successful in providing services to large urban centres, as well as to 
  districts and rural communities (Sharma 1996). International agreements and 
  protocols have also been established, either as proactive measures or in response 
  to escalating conflict over shared watercourses. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), 
  the Regional Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Nubian Sandstone 
  Aquifer (NSA), and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol 
  on Shared Water Courses are successful examples of transboundary cooperation 
  for the sustainable use and development of water resources.</p>
<p>Hydrological Cycle Observing Systems (HYCOS) projects are in operation in the 
  Mediterranean zone, and in the southern Africa, western Africa and central Africa 
  sub-regions. Similar systems are being established for the Inter-Governmental 
  Authority on Development (IGAD), Congo basin and Nile basin areas. These systems 
  have been established primarily as monitoring and assessment stations, building 
  capacity in data collection and information dissemination. They monitor hydrological 
  conditions, and have provided valuable information, such as early warning of 
  rainfall fluctuations and extreme events (WMO 2001).</p>
