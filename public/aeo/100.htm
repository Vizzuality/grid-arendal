<h2>NORTHERN AFRICA </h2>
<p>The main issues of concern in the coastal zones of Northern Africa are the 
  effects of rapidly developing tourism and industrial activities along the coast 
  combined with rapid population growth (UNEP 1997). These pressures are beginning 
  to have impacts on the quality and stability of the physical and biological 
  coastal environment. There are also serious concerns over the potential impacts 
  of climate change, particularly the vulnerability of coastal settlements and 
  natural habitats to sea level rise and saltwater intrusion.</p>
<h4>Economic, social and ecological value of coastal and marine environments in 
  Northern Africa</h4>
<p>The marine and coastal zones of Northern Africa support tourism, fishing, and 
  petroleum industries. The significant onshore and offshore oil and gas deposits 
  in the sub-region are the mainstays of countries' economies, providing opportunities 
  for export and employment.</p>

<p><a name="fig2c4"></a>Coral reefs are widely spread and well developed in the 
  Red Sea, with 194 species of coral and at least 450 common reef-associated species. 
  These are also some of the most northerly located coral reefs, and have many 
  endemic species.</p>
<p>Mangroves are found along the southern Red Sea coast, and are important sources 
  of molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, and raw materials for construction, animal 
  fodder, and fuel. They are also important nesting sites for migratory waterbirds. 
  Sea grasses are also fairly common along the southern Red Sea, and rare or protected 
  species such as turtles and dugongs add to the species richness and diversity 
  that attracts an estimated one million tourists per year to the region (UNEP 
  1997).</p>
<p>Northern Africa also has economically important marine fisheries from which 
  total catches increased from 845 211 tonnes in 1990 to 1.1 million tonnes in 
  1997, an increase of about 30 per cent (FAOSTAT 2001). The trend in marine fish 
  catches in the Northern Africa sub-region over the past 30 years is shown in 
  <a href="#fig2c4">Figure 2c.4</a>.</p>
<p>Although fishing activity has increased in the Mediterranean over the years, 
  its fisheries are not showing signs of overexploitation. In fact, surprisingly- 
  as the demand for fisheries products is growing and as most countries lack formal 
  and coordinated fisheries management-there has been an increase in production 
  for all major species (FAO 1997).</p>
<p>Mediterranean states are party to the FAO's General Fisheries Council for the 
  Mediterranean, but this is largely ineffectual and fishing by commercial fleets 
  is virtually unregulated. At the 22nd session of the Council, member states 
  were urged to negotiate and implement an effective management regime based on 
  the precautionary principle and reflecting the underlying tenets of important 
  international initiatives (WWF 1997). Artisanal fishery resources are also important 
  in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Shallow water species such as butterfly fish 
  and damselfish are most common, although the area also supports rock lobster, 
  cuttlefish, shrimp, and sea cucumber.</p>
<p>More than 40 per cent of the Mediterranean area's population live in coastal 
  zones (UNEP 1996), with the greatest densities along the Nile Delta and Algerian 
  coast (up to 500-1000 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> in some areas) (Blue Plan 1996). 
  Urbanization in coastal north-west Africa has been driven mainly by oil discoveries 
  and increased industrialization in or near the coastal areas and the associated 
  new economic opportunities. This has led to an almost complete transformation 
  of northwest African society and gradually increasing pressures on coastal areas.</p>
