<p>Wildlife management in the region has undergone many changes over the past 
  30 years, from the colonial policies of protectionism of wildlife at the expense 
  of communities, to sustainable utilization, which supports community involvement. 
  Countries in different subregions have implemented or are implementing community-based 
  natural resource management (CBNRM) programmes not only to address the issue 
  of biodiversity conservation, but also to generate income for communities and 
  to help to reduce rural poverty. One of the CBNRM programmes which has been 
  introduced is the <i>Tchuma Tchato </i>('Our Wealth') initiative in Mozambique's 
  northern Tete province (see <a href="#box319">Box 3.19</a>). </p>

            <p><i>Tchuma Tchato </i>('Our Wealth'), a CBNRM project, has helped 
              to restore the people's control over wildlife and natural resources 
              in northwestern Mozambique. Traditional hunting, on which the community 
              depended for both food and income, was declared poaching' in 1989 
              by a private landowner to whom the central government had leased 
              hunting rights. Now, with restoration of both control of and the 
              right to derive benefits from the area's natural resources, the 
              community is more inclined to protect those resources, resulting 
              in better conservation of wildlife and habitats.</p>
            <p>The <i>Tchuma Tchato </i>project region is in the biodiversity-rich 
              'Tri-Nations Corner', where the borders of Mozambique, Zambia and 
              Zimbabwe meet. The project encompasses six villages in the northwestern 
              part of Tete province, in the mopane woodland, part of a vast, savannah-covered 
              plateau encompassing more than 30 per cent of Mozambique's 799 380 
              km<sup>2</sup>. Tete is one of the least populated of Mozambique's 
              10 provinces. The project area, which is spread over 2 500 km<sup>2</sup> 
              adjacent to the Zambezi river, has a population density of fewer 
              than 5 people per 1 km<sup>2</sup>, compared to about 2 590 people 
              per 1 km<sup>2</sup> in Maputo, Mozambique's capital.</p>
            <p>Initiated in 1994, <i>Tchuma Tchato </i>was started, in large part, 
              to undo problems created by the two-phase (1964-75 and 1976-92) 
              Mozambican civil war. The conflict destroyed social structures, 
              displaced millions of people, and devastated wildlife management 
              structures and institutions. The Tete region, as well as other parts 
              of the country, became a large, uncontrolled hunting area. Elephant 
              populations were decimated as combatants on both sides hunted the 
              animals for meat and ivory.</p>
            <p><i>Tchuma Tchato</i>'s purpose is to make communities aware of 
              the link between their economic welfare and the region's wild animals 
              and biodiversity. The project stresses the advantages of the community 
              acting as caretakers of the animals and the region, which means 
              stopping poaching and overexploitation of resources. Since the project 
              began, the elephant population has increased and is flourishing. 
              The region's biodiversity provides a solid basis for ecotourism. 
              For this reason, a seven-chalet campsite, controlled by the Provincial 
              Directorate of Agriculture and Fisheries through the <i>Tchuma Tchato</i> 
              project manager, has been built on the bank of the Zambezi river.</p>
            <p>Before the project started, the community derived its income primarily 
              from hunting, subsistence agriculture and fishing.The project created 
              new sources of income by employing some villagers to work as staff 
              at the chalet complex and as game scouts. Revenue from both game 
              hunting and the chalet operation is split three ways: 35 per cent 
              to central government, 32.5 per cent to regional government and 
              32.5 per cent to the <i>Tchuma Tchato </i>project. The six villages 
              involved in the project have established natural resource management 
              councils to help manage the project on their behalf and to decide 
              how revenues are used.</p>
