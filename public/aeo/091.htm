<p>Western African states nevertheless face several obstacles to implementation, 
  including financial and human resource constraints, lack of awareness among 
  the general public and among decision-makers, inadequate legal structures at 
  the national level, and ineffective cooperation between countries in the subregion. 
  It is critical that these efforts be strengthened and that they become sustainable, 
  financially as well as environmentally. Developing policies with donor funds 
  is a step in the right direction, but funding streams need to be established 
  to ensure implementation of policies and enforcement of regulations.</p>
<p>In Côte d'Ivoire, the Taï National Park, a large tract of undisturbed rainforest, 
  is a World Heritage Site but is nevertheless threatened by slash-and-burn agriculture, 
  poaching, and illegal logging and mining activities. A long-term management 
  plan has recently been developed for the area, by WWF in conjunction with local 
  people, and is currently being implemented. The Gashka Gumpti National Park, 
  in Nigeria, encompasses a range of habitats across a range of altitudes from 
  450 to 4000 m. Chimpanzees are among the threatened species that survive in 
  the forests. The Nigerian Conservation Foundation and WWF are developing a plan 
  to promote tourism in the park, stimulating the economy through conservation 
  efforts. The Drill Rehabilitation and Breeding Centre (DRBC) in Calabar, Nigeria, 
  was set up in cooperation with the Cross River State Ministry of Agriculture, 
  Forestry Department and Cross River National Park. This is the only purpose-built 
  in-situ captive-breeding programme for an endangered African primate. The programme 
  is achieving a high rate of live births and successful rearing of offspring. 
  In May 2000, the Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary was 'gazetted' (i.e. legally 
  protected) and will protect one of the Nigerian populations of the Cross River 
  Gorilla as well as drills, chimpanzees and other primate species. It also houses 
  a new facility for the DRBC. The DRBC is also conducting community outreach 
  programmes to bolster support for conservation activities within the community 
  (Gadsby & Jenkins 1998, Oates 2001).</p>

      <p>Traditional knowledge and practices must be re-incorporated into regional 
        conservation strategies, and communities and commercial companies must 
        be provided with alternative resources or means of production. Simply 
        excluding activities from one area intensifies the pressure on other areas 
        and resources</p>

<p>Traditional protection and conservation beliefs and practices have always existed 
  in all countries in the subregion, but some of them have been eclipsed by modern 
  activities. However, African countries are now realizing the importance of documenting 
  knowledge and implementing traditional practices. The United Nations University 
  Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (Accra, Ghana) has, for example, initiated 
  a project to catalogue local indigenous plants that are useful as food and for 
  pharmaceuticals, and to promote homestead gardens (Baidu-Forson 1999). Also 
  in Ghana, the traditional grove system has been re-introduced into conservation 
  models, enhancing biodiversity while sustainably using the resources in surrounding 
  buffer zones of the grove (Oteng-Yeboah 1996).</p>
<p>Actions at the local level include a project in Ghana to support the conservation 
  and sustainable use of medicinal plants. The main aims of the project are to 
  establish and document base-line data, build capacity and raise awareness, and 
  relieve the pressure from harvesting of these plants in the wild. Plans are 
  in place to establish a working example of a medicinal plant garden, and to 
  provide training to promote others across Ghana to help people to become able 
  to manage their own medicinal garden businesses. The World Bank's Indigenous 
  Knowledge for Africa Programme has encouraged research and promotion of the 
  role of traditional hunters in natural resource management in Burkina Faso (World 
  Bank 2001b). In Mauritania, WWF has supported the Banc d'Arguin National Park 
  (a World Heritage Site) by assisting local communities and park officials to 
  improve patrolling and control illegal fishing.</p>
