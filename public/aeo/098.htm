<a name="img2c3"></a>Responses to marine and coastal pollution include the ratification 
and national implementation of international agreements such as the Convention 
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the Regional Convention for 
the Conservation of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Environment (Jeddah Convention), 
the Barcelona Convention's Mediterranean Action Plan, the Nairobi Convention, 
designed to ensure that resource development in Eastern Africa's coastal zone 
is in harmony with the maintenance of environmental quality, and the Convention 
for Cooperation in the Protection and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment 
of the West and Central African Region (Abidjan Convention). Whilst some conventions 
have been implemented with significant success to date, others have experienced 
delays in ratification and have received inadequate human-resource and financial 
support. The Nairobi Convention, for example, was signed in 1985 but only came 
into force in 1996. Difficulties in monitoring and enforcement of penalties for 
non-compliance have also been experienced, mainly because of the extensive territories 
requiring policing and lack of efficient surveillance systems. The governments 
of Africa have embarked on an African process for development and management of 
the coastal areas and are now committed to strengthening and reviewing the Abidjan 
and Nairobi Conventions. Public health legislation and municipal cleaning of coastal 
areas are additional responses from some governments of coastal African countries. 
<h5>Integrated Coastal Zone Management</h5>
<p>Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a holistic management approach 
  which considers not just individual resources but the entire coastal and marine 
  environment, and thereby aims to overcome the fragmentation inherent in the 
  sectoral management approach. It has become a popular mechanism for national 
  implementation of regionally accepted management objectives and is intended 
  to overcome the diverse nature and distribution of resources, the complex activities 
  and sources of environmental degradation, and competition for access and use 
  of resources between user groups. ICZM has been defined as <i>'a continuous 
  and dynamic process by which decisions are taken for the sustainable use, development, 
  and protection of coastal and marine areas and resources' </i>(Cicin-Sain & 
  Knecht 1998). By recognizing the relationships between different elements of 
  the environments and the impacts of multiple uses and pressures, sustainable 
  harvesting levels and patterns of non-consumptive use can be achieved and maintained. 
  According to Agenda 21 (Chapter 17), ICZM programmes should be designed to: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>identify existing and projected uses of coastal areas with a focus on their 
    interactions and interdependencies; </li>
  <li>concentrate on well-defined issues; </li>
  <li>apply preventive and precautionary approaches in project planning and implementation, 
    including prior assessment and systematic observation of the impacts of major 
    projects; </li>
  <li>promote the development and application of methods such as natural resource 
    and environmental accounting that reflect changes in value resulting from 
    uses of coastal and marine areas; </li>
  <li>provide access for concerned individuals, groups and organizations to relevant 
    information and opportunities for consultation and participation in planning 
    and decision-making.</li>
</ul>
