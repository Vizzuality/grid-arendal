<h3>POLLUTION OF EASTERN AFRICA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT </h3>
<p>Environmental quality in the coastal and marine environments of Eastern Africa 
  is under increasing pressure from land- and sea-based sources of pollution. 
  Land-derived agrochemical and municipal wastes and sea-based petroleum wastes 
  are the major causes of pollution in the sub-region (Martens 1992, Okemwa & 
  Wakwabi 1993). Residues of fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural inputs 
  in the hinterland enter main drainage systems and are washed into the sea where 
  they have cumulative effects in the marine and coastal environment (Onyari 1981). 
  At the same time, increased siltation resulting from deforestation in the hinterlands 
  also impacts the coastal habitats by increasing the turbidity of the waters, 
  and smothering habitats, flora, and fauna. Eutrophication is not yet a serious 
  issue in the sub-region, but isolated pockets in sheltered bays (especially 
  along the Kenya coast) are threatened with blooms of toxic algae (Wawiye, Ogongo 
  & Tunje 2000) and phytoplanktonic bacteria (Mwangi, Kirugara, Osore, Njoya, 
  Yobe, & Dzeha 2000).</p>
<p>The coastal waters of the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean are the major sea 
  routes for large petroleum and oil tankers supplying the world with products 
  from the Middle East. Major shipping routes run close to the coral reefs near 
  the port of Djibouti and Port Sudan and ships often discharge oily wastes and 
  sewage. Ships also cause physical damage to the reefs when poor navigation brings 
  them into collision with the reefs (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 2000). Longshore currents 
  and winds in the Western Indian Ocean are instrumental in the horizontal distribution 
  and spread of pollutants, particularly in bringing oil slicks from the open 
  sea (beyond the EEZ limit) into the coastal waters. In addition to the elevated 
  risk of high-impact oil spills, frequent transport operations also contribute 
  to oil pollution-oil tankers often empty ballast and wash engines on the high 
  seas and residues of degraded oil are consolidated and washed ashore by onshore 
  winds, currents and waves. Tar balls litter beaches with deleterious effects 
  on wildlife and on humans that use the beaches (Munga 1981). Soluble PCBs from 
  these products poison marine life and accumulate in the food web, causing physiological 
  disorders in top predators.</p>

        sea, or in an unsatisfactory manner, and end up by being washed or blown

<p>Treated and untreated effluents from municipal, industrial and domestic sources 
  further contribute to coastal and marine pollution. Waste treatment facilities 
  are often poorly designed or sited, and are old and poorly maintained or overloaded. 
  Location of dumpsites and municipal sewage outfalls is therefore critical in 
  maintaining environmental quality (especially water quality, both inshore and 
  offshore) when urbanization and other forms of coastal development increase. 
  (Mwaguni & Munga 1997).</p>
<p>Most Eastern African coastal municipalities do not have the capacity to handle 
  the vast quantities of sewage and solid wastes they generate every day. For 
  example, the Mombasa Municipal Council (Kenya), can handle only 30 per cent 
  of the waste generated (Anon 1996). In Djibouti and Somalia, sewage treatment 
  plants are few in number and are, generally, poorly maintained (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 
  2000). Large volumes of solid and liquid waste are therefore disposed of at 
  sea or are disposed of in an unsatisfactory manner and end up by being washed 
  or blown out to sea, where they pose a threat to wildlife and human health. 
  It is evident that a restructuring of waste management policies and plans is 
  required to handle the increase in solid wastes and sewage in the coming years.</p>
<h4>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Governments in Eastern Africa have enacted public health legislation to regulate 
  responsible environmental use of chemicals. There are also integrated resource 
  management plans aimed at improving land use practices in the hinterland, thereby 
  reducing the incidence and impacts of siltation and eutrophication. Global and 
  regional agreements and treaties are also in place for enhanced cooperation 
  on environmental management in the region. Furthermore, the Nairobi Convention 
  calls for enhanced management of landbased and marine-based sources of pollution, 
  and mitigation of their impacts.</p>
<p>Effective implementation, monitoring, and regulation of activities requires 
  enhanced political commitment and coordination, as well as sustained resourcing. 
  For example, Kenya's National Oil Spill Response Committee should be given legal 
  status and contingency plans should be developed comprehensively. The Kenya 
  Marine Fisheries and Research Institute also requires further financial and 
  human resources to support its research work and monitoring of the coastal and 
  marine environments (FAO/EAF 1999).</p>
<p>Djibouti and Somalia are parties to the Jeddah Convention and members of PERGSA, 
  its implementation agency. Progress in enhancing environmental quality in these 
  countries includes assessment, monitoring and state of the environment reporting, 
  capacity building in oil spill response and integrated coastal management.</p>
<h5>Towards ICZM in Eastern Africa</h5>
<p>ICZM and appropriate legislation and regulations on environmental management 
  are important steps towards the sustainable use of Eastern Africa's coastal 
  zone and resources in the hinterland. There are already national initiatives 
  that should be encouraged by enhanced regional cooperation (Linden 1993, Ngoile 
  1997, PERSGA 2000). For example, ICZM plans for Kenya and Eritrea use a site-specific 
  approach for the integration of beachfront/seafront developments and waste management 
  in coastal urban centres. Under these plans, location of dumpsites and sewage 
  outfalls will be properly planned and their effects closely monitored.</p>
<p>If success of such initiatives is to be sustained, their institutional structures 
  will need to be strengthened, their coordination improved, and their capacity 
  and funding will need to be increased. Priorities include improved waste management 
  and erosion control in the coastal zone and, in the hinterland, improvement 
  of agricultural practices and introduction of measures such as reforestation 
  schemes, and soil conservation programmes to prevent soil erosion (see <a href="#box2c3">Box 
  2c.3</a>).</p>
