<a name="img38"></a>One of the most destructively persistent historical legacies 
of Africa's past has been the subversion and destruction of indigenous coping 
strategies due to foreign military, political, administrative and economic interference. 
Colonial dispossession of the richest traditional pastoral and agricultural lands 
from Africans, and the commodotization of agriculture production for export purposes, 
marked two of the most far-reaching colonial interventions which have significantly 
contributed to Africa's current state of vulnerability. The loss of pasturage 
and farmland to colonial settlement/private ownership, and insecure land tenure 
for the native population, have further undermined traditional coping strategies. 
In Eastern and Southern Africa, in particular, indigenous Africans were confined 
to marginal, and increasingly degraded and unproductive, lands due to the impacts 
of settler agriculture, colonialism and subsequent changes in traditional land 
tenure which exacerbated negative environmental change after independence. In 
Ethiopia, for example, foreign resource conservation measures introduced by the 
government between 1971 and 1985 not only eroded indigenous processes of resource 
conservation, but also led to soil erosion and impact on crop production (Singh 
2000). 
<h3>CIVIL STRIFE AND ARMED CONFLICT</h3>
<p>A total of 26 armed conflicts erupted in Africa between 1963 and 1998, affecting 
  474 million people in Africa, or 61 per cent of the population. Some 79 per 
  cent of people were affected in Eastern Africa; 73 per cent in Central Africa; 
  64 per cent in Western Africa; 51 per cent in Northern Africa; and 29 per cent 
  in Southern Africa (ECA 2001). Another impact of armed conflict is the creation 
  of refugees. In 2001 in Central Africa and the Horn of Africa, for example, 
  a total of about 9.6 million people were either refugees or internally displaced 
  as a result of armed conflict (US Committee for Refugees 2001). Refugee settlements 
  often result in environmental degradation which, in turn, increase human vulnerability, 
  limiting livelihood options and exposing the refugees to health risks.</p>
<p>Environmental change due to environmental stress has an indirect impact on 
  the outbreak of conflict. Environmental stress-including deforestation, land 
  degradation and scarce supply of freshwater-alone, and in combination with high 
  population density, increases the risk of low-level conflict.</p>
<p>Armed conflict over resources can also spill over national borders. In 1977-78, 
  deforestation and soil degradation, in conjunction with rapid population growth, 
  forced Somali pastoralists to migrate to Ethiopia, resulting in conflict between 
  the two countries (Molvoer 1991). Overgrazing induced widespread deforestation 
  and desertification in Somalia, prompting the large migrations of Somali pastoralists 
  into Ethiopian territory. The migrations brought the Somali pastoralists face 
  to face with local Ethiopians who were dependent on the same resources. The 
  bitter competition between these groups fuelled cross-border tensions which 
  eventually found an outlet in armed conflict between the two nations.</p>
<p>Conflicts in the region are partly attributed to disputes over environmental 
  resources. For example, Liberia/Sierra Leone/Guinea conflicts are partly attributed 
  to contest over the resources of the Manor River basin. The DRC/Rwanda conflicts, 
  the Sudanese conflict, and tribal conflicts and wars in many African countries 
  are attributed, in part, to contest over natural resources. Environmental problems 
  which are exacerbated by civil strife, armed conflicts and wars are threatening 
  the survival of large numbers of people in the Africa region, and these problems 
  are becoming increasingly serious. The types of environmentally related conflicts 
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple scarcity conflicts which may arise over three major types of resources: 
    river water, fish and agriculturally productive land. These renewable resources 
    are likely to spark conflict because they are rapidly becoming scarce in some 
    regions, they are essential for human survival and they can be physically 
    seized or controlled.</li>
  <li>Group identity conflicts, which are likely to arise from the large-scale 
    movements of populations brought about by environmental change, for instance, 
    the earlier Ethiopia/Somalia example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation described above is vividly illustrated by a case study on natural 
  resources scarcity and conflicts, summarized in the <a href="#box310">Box 3.10</a>.</p>

            <p>The semi-arid land of northern Uganda is usually referred to as 
              Karamoja. It is home to pastoralists called karimojong,made up of 
              several tribes which depend on livestock for food, payment of bride 
              price and other cash needs.</p>
            <p>Karamoja is characterized by low/unreliable rainfall. Scarcity 
              of water for human and animal needs, and inadequate pasture for 
              grazing, results in overstocking of livestock in the area in relation 
              to the carrying capacity of the limited pasture. The groundwater 
              resources on which the population depend has been reducing because 
              the water table in the area has been falling since 1960, as a result 
              of the effects of drought and other aspects of environmental degradation. 
              Also, the rate of livestock loss is high, due to the effects of 
              drought and disease. Furthermore, about 50 per cent of Karamoja 
              is a protected biodiversity conservation area, where the government 
              prohibits any human activities.</p>
            <p>The explosive situation described above has led to internal armed 
              conflicts and cattle raiding between the different tribes, and also 
              to external armed conflicts with people from neighbouring countries 
              with the same resource scarcity problems.</p>

<p>The analysis of the relationship between environmental change (especially that 
  which leads to scarcity), violent conflict and security has highlighted both 
  positive and negative social effects (Matthew 2000). The negative social effects 
  of environmental change include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Decreased agricultural production and productivity, which may arise as 
    a result of the effects of deforestation, as well as of the degrading and 
    decreasing of available agricultural land. </li>
  <li>Depressing economic performance as a result of environmental degradation, 
    leading to further impoverishment in the affected countries. </li>
  <li>Population displacement, compelling people to migrate in search of livelihood 
    opportunities. </li>
  <li>Intensifying group identity tensions, forcing people onto marginal lands 
    and promoting resource capture by social subgroups-all of which may generate 
    diffuse and persistent misery, frustration and resentment. </li>
  <li>Rendering individuals and groups increasingly vulnerable to natural and 
    human-made disasters. </li>
  <li>Disruption of legitimized and authoritative institutions and social relations.</li>
</ul>
