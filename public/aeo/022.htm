      <p>'The international community seems to remember the existence of Africa 
        only when disaster strikes the continent. Yet in Africa, like in other 
        developing regions, poverty is the single most serious contributor to 
        environmental degradation associated with land abuse, deforestation and 
        the lack of access to freshwater.'<br>

<p>One of the challenges facing Africa is the failure of economic markets to capture 
  and promote the real value of Africa's natural resources. Many African countries 
  are in the same position today as they were at independence, that is, dependent 
  on capital from natural resources for economic development and growth. Commodity 
  prices on exports from developing countries are determined by the World Tr ade 
  Organization (WTO) through a quota system. This puts African countries at a 
  great disadvantage. In most countries, national policies and market activities 
  fail to reflect the full economic value and potential of their natural resources. 
  This has led to the degradation and overexploitation of natural resources, as 
  industry and commerce have generally focused on maximizing profits at the expense 
  of sound environmental management and protection. The greatest problem lies 
  in the imbalance in the use of the natural resources, which results from a combination 
  of factors, such as: lack of investment capital; inappropriate technologies; 
  and poor management.</p>
<h4>Debt</h4>
<p>External debt continues to be a major impediment to the achievement of accelerated 
  economic development and sustainable environmental management in the region. 
  Africa's external debt has been growing since the 1980s (Expanded Joint Secretariat 
  2001). The total debt stock stood at US$313 000 million in 1994, equivalent 
  to 234 per cent of income from exports, and 83 per cent of gross domestic product 
  (GDP) (UNEP 1999). Between 1980 and 1995, 22 African countries renegotiated 
  their commercial bank debts 58 times. During the same period, 35 African countries 
  renegotiated their external debt with their creditors in the Paris Club a total 
  of 151 times (Expanded Joint Secretariat 2001). Some 33 of the 41 most heavily 
  indebted countries in the world (in relative terms) are in Africa. The debt 
  issue is covered in more detail in Chapter 3 of this report. </p>
<p>In many countries of the region, natural resource utilization is driven by 
  the demand on governments to earn foreign exchange from exports of primary commodities. 
  Trade liberalization and the pressures to service foreign debts may exacerbate 
  environmental degradation, if appropriate regulatory policies and laws are not 
  instituted. In the face of declining export earnings and debt burdens, many 
  governments have tried to boost the exploitation of natural resources and cash 
  crop production. This has led to widespread environmental damage, as rural communities 
  are forced to cultivate fragile and marginal areas.</p>
<h4>Globalization</h4>
<p>Globalization has resulted in the removal of barriers to trade, capital mobility 
  and technological advances, mostly in the developed world. While globalization 
  may drive future economic prosperity, including poverty reduction, it has, however, 
  advanced the interests of developed countries to the detriment of developing 
  countries, particularly in the areas of trade, finance and technology.</p>
<p>The Millennium Report of the United Nations Secretary-General, published in 
  September 2000, states that although globalization is transforming the world 
  today, there are dangers associated with it, including crime, narcotics, terrorism, 
  diseases and weapons. The benefits and the opportunities of globalization are 
  concentrated in a small number of countries. An imbalance has arisen between 
  the creation and enforcement of rules which have facilitated the expansion of 
  global markets, while environmental activities or social programmes-such as 
  labour standards, human rights or poverty reduction-have received no support 
  (Expanded Joint Secretariat 2001). </p>
