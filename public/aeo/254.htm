<p><a name="fig33"></a>One of the key responses to reduce the vulnerability of 
  people is early warning. Various early warning initiatives have been implemented 
  in the region. The Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) is perhaps one of the 
  more widely known initiatives in Africa. The 1985 famine in Ethiopia galvanized 
  African countries to establish FEWS, with funding support from the United States 
  Agency for International Development (USAID). The main objective of FEWS is 
  to lower the incidence of drought-induced famine by providing timely and accurate 
  information to decision makers regarding potential famine conditions. The monitoring 
  and response to famine has different phases, as shown in <a href="#fig33">Figure 
  3.3</a>.</p>
<p>Satellite data collected and processed by the US National Aeronautics and Space 
  Administration, (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
  (NOAA) are used to monitor vegetation conditions and rainfall across Africa. 
  USAID has established a FEWS Network (FEWS NET), which is an information system 
  designed to identify problems in the food supply system which can potentially 
  lead to famine, flood or other food-insecure conditions in sub- Saharan Africa. 
  FEWS NET is a multi-disciplinary project which collects, analyses and distributes 
  regional, national and sub-national information to decisionmakers about potential 
  or current famine or flood situations, allowing them to authorize timely measures 
  to prevent food-insecure conditions in these nations. Countries with FEWS NET 
  representatives are: Burkina Faso, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, 
  Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia, (southern) Sudan, Tanzania, 
  Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe (USGS undated).</p>
<p>At a sub-regional level, in 1996-98, countries in Southern Africa established, 
  with the support of FAO technical assistance: the Regional Early Warning System 
  (REWS); the Regional Early Warning Unit (REWU); the Regional Remote Sensing 
  Unit (RRSU); and the National Early Warning System (NEWS) (Chopak 2000).</p>
<h3>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT IN AFRICA</h3>
<p>One practical example of vulnerability assessment is the in-depth vulnerability 
  analysis mapping in Mozambique which has been used to classify the country into 
  different food production systems. The project has entailed a multidisciplinary 
  group, involving, among others: the Ministry of Health (Department of Nutrition); 
  the Ministry of Planning and Finance (Department of Social Development, Poverty 
  Alleviation Unit); and the National Early Warning Unit within the Department 
  of Agriculture. Some of the preliminary mapping products include: flood risk 
  maps; NDVI identification of drought risk areas; food systems maps; land use 
  maps; market access maps; and health and nutritional profiles. Collection, analysis 
  and presentation of food security and nutrition has been institutionalized within 
  government, becoming a tool for local development, service delivery and monitoring, 
  as well as scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges for the region will be to design interventions 
  which identify and target the various interacting dimensions which characterize 
  vulnerability. In broad terms, this implies developing vulnerability assessment 
  methodologies based on multi-disciplinary, integrated and coordinated strategies.</p>
<p>Human vulnerability and security assessment is a valuable tool for integrating 
  environmental concerns into evaluations of livelihood security and sustainable 
  development in the region. In Africa, with major populations exposed to adverse 
  environmental change in both rural and urban areas, vulnerability assessment, 
  IEM and disaster early warning systems can be integrated into a powerful tool 
  for planning towards sustainable policies, plans and development. There are 
  already examples of vulnerability assessments taking place in Africa (see <a href="#box318">Box 
  3.18</a>). </p>
