<h4>Combating species loss </h4>
<p>Forty-eight African countries are party to the Convention on International 
  Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) which regulates trade 
  in endangered species or products through trade prohibitions or suspensions. 
  This has had varying degrees of success in Africa. For example, there has been 
  significant growth in national herds of elephant in Botswana and Zimbabwe in 
  recent years after a ban was introduced on trading in ivory, although it is 
  argued in some quarters, that this has more to do with good conservation measures 
  than trade restrictions on ivory. Southern African countries now want to resume 
  some level of trade in order to capitalize on economic opportunities from successful 
  conservation. In Kenya, however, the decline in poaching of elephants (from 
  3000 deaths a year to under 50) which followed a dramatic drop in prices in 
  ivory (from US$60 to US$5 a kilo in Somalia) indicated direct links between 
  the ivory trade, prices and criminal activities (Western 1997). East African 
  countries feel that any relaxation of restrictions will further endanger their 
  elephant populations which have not recovered so quickly. The black rhino, another 
  endangered species, is still threatened throughout Africa by illegal hunting 
  and populations have not recovered to pre-1960s levels.</p>
<p>Species re-introduction and <i>ex-situ</i> plant propagation in nurseries are 
  some of the additional efforts underway to counteract the recent rapid loss 
  of species in Africa. In the Western Indian Ocean Islands, successful conservation 
  measures resulted in growth of populations of the Mauritian Kestrel and the 
  Pink Pigeon.</p>
