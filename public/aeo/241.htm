<h3>DISASTERS</h3>
<p>Human mismanagement of environmental resources and processes significantly 
  exacerbates the impacts resulting from disasters, and their effects on natural 
  resources. <a href="#box37">Box 3.7</a> highlights some recent environmental 
  disasters in Africa.</p>

            <p>Extreme droughts have resulted in exceptional food emergencies 
              in Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia, 
              Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda (FAO 2001).</p>
            <p>People in Africa are also vulnerable to floods, such as those which 
              submerged more than 79 000 ha of planted land, severely affecting 
              the livelihoods of nearly 120 000 farm families in central Mozambique 
              in February and March 2001 (FAO/TCOR 2001). Farmers lost their crops, 
              livestock, food and seed reserves, and hand tools. Simultaneously, 
              the cyclone Dera hit the provinces of Nampula and Tete in March 
              2001, devastating about 2 000 families which depend on fisheries. 
              The floods and cyclone also caused severe damage to infrastructure. 
              As a result of the damage and loss of livelihoods due to these extreme 
              events, the Food and Agriculture Organization( FAO) launched an 
              appeal for US$8.71 million in assistance for Mozambique.</p>
            <p>In North Africa (Egypt and Algeria), 22 earthquakes killed 14 405 
              people, and affected another 106 150 people, between 1980 and 1998 
              (EM-DAT undated). In mid-January 2002, lava flowing from the erupting 
              Mount Nyiragongo destroyed half of the city of Goma in the eastern 
              Democratic Republic of Congo, together with crops and biodiversity.More 
              than 400 000 people fled to take refuge in neighbouring villages 
              and in Rwanda.</p>

<p>East Africa is exposed to seismic hazards due to the presence of the Rift Valley 
  system. Earthquakes have been identified as a major threat in the area, which 
  covers about 5.5 million km<sup>2</sup> and holds more than 120 million people 
  (Midzi and others, 1999). The vulnerability of East African populations to seismic 
  events has been underscored by a recent study which advises that the region's 
  capacity in earthquake preparedness and hazard mitigation needs to be improved 
  'significantly' (Midzi and others 1999).</p>
<p>In Central Africa, Mount Cameroon has erupted twice in the past 40 years, pouring 
  out tonnes of lava and destroying farms and biodiversity. The last eruption 
  was in the year 2000, and earth tremors occur every three to four years on average. 
  Explosive emissions of toxic gases from Lake Nyos and Lake Mounoun, both crater 
  lakes in the mountainous west of Cameroon, killed thousands of people, livestock 
  and wildlife in 1986. <a href="#box38">Box 3.8</a> gives examples of disasters 
  which have struck Nigeria in the recent past.</p>

            <p>Four main categories of disaster have occurred in Nigeria over 
              the past three years, and they have had significant environmental 
              consequences.</p>
            <p><i>Industrial accidents</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>On 10 July 2000, a pipeline in Nigeria exploded, killing about 
                250 villagers. Fires burned out of control about 20 km from the 
                town of Jesse. </li>
              <li>On 27 January 2002, at least 600 people were drowned and thousands 
                were rendered homeless after multiple bomb explosions at a Nigerian 
                military armoury, triggered by an accidental fire.Mass panic ensued.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Civil strife and conflicts (some related to community land resource 
              ownership) </i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>On 4 June 1999, ethnic clashes flared up in Nigeria's southern 
                oil industry hub of Warri. Dozens of people were reported dead 
                in six days of fighting. </li>
              <li>On 19 July 1999, at least 60 people died in clashes between 
                Hausa and Yoruba tribes near Lagos. </li>
              <li>On 26 July 1999, troops were sent to Kano after at least 60 
                people were killed in renewed ethnic clashes in northern Nigeria.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Property rights and unequal sharing of benefits from natural 
              resources </i> </p>
            <ul>
              <li>On 1 January 1999, at least 19 people died in clashes in Nigeria's 
                oil region after an ultimatum to oil firms to leave ethnic Ijaw 
                areas. </li>
              <li>On 3 June 1999, local youths set fires at four separate points 
                on the Warri-Kaduna products pipeline near the village of Adeje, 
                after police arrested suspected product thieves. The number of 
                dead was undetermined.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Rural and urban poverty which lead people to take deadly risks 
              to get money </i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>On 18 October 1998, fire engulfed more than 2 000 villagers 
                who were scrambling for petrol near a ruptured pipeline in Jesse, 
                outside Warri. Nearly 1 000 people were killed. </li>
              <li>14 March 1999, at least 50 villagers who were scooping up gasoline 
                from a broken products pipeline at Umuichieichi-Umungbede village 
                in Abia state were burned to death after an explosion.</li>

<p>Although natural disasters cannot be prevented, sustainable utilization and 
  management of the environment can increase coping capacities at community level. 
  An effective management regime would include: economic policies which encourage 
  smallholder agricultural production; the enforcement of relevant laws and regulations; 
  incentive measures which encourage agricultural and biodiversity conservation 
  at community level; and integrated and coordinated planning. The integration 
  and implementation of sustainability strategies at community and national levels 
  would enhance coping capacities by reducing dependency on aid. Sustainability 
  strategies would develop and support an enabling environment for households 
  and communities, and would improve forecasting abilities which could forestall 
  the potential of environmental events to translate into environmental disasters.</p>
