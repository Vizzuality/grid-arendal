<h3>COASTAL EROSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN CENTRAL AFRICA </h3>
<p>Population densities in coastal urban centres in Central African countries 
  are increasing under the dual pressure of population growth and migration. Major 
  coastal cities include Douala in Cameroon (population 1.6 million in 2000) (UNCHS 
  2001), and Libreville in Gabon (population approximately 400 000 in 1993, around 
  50 per cent of the total population of Gabon) (World Bank 1997). Migration to 
  the coast is prompted by opportunities for agriculture (fertile soils and favourable 
  climate) and employment (large number of industries based on the coast). The 
  resulting conversion of natural habitat to urban settlements and agricultural 
  plantations, together with poor resource management practices inland, has accelerated 
  rates of coastal erosion and this is now a significant problem in Central Africa. 
  The rate of coastal erosion in Gabon, for example, is reported as having reached 
  around 10 m per year as a result of clearance of mangrove forests (ESA-ESRIN 
  1996). Erosion is accelerated by construction of dams upstream of the coastal 
  zone. Dams reduce the sediment load in rivers reaching the coastal areas and 
  control their flow patterns, thereby increasing their erosive potential.</p>
<p>Development of coastal infrastructure and poor design and management of coastal 
  cities lead to clearance of natural, stabilizing vegetation and increased exposure 
  to wind and water erosion, thus contributing to destabilization of the sands 
  and soils in the coastal zone. Mining of dunes also destabilizes the coastal 
  zone and enhances the potential for erosion by changing patterns of erosion 
  and deposition. Eroded material is washed out to sea where it settles out along 
  shipping routes which then have to be dredged to prevent grounding of ships, 
  particularly oil tankers (ESAESRIN 1996).</p>
<p>In oil producing states, the development of canals for oil transportation is 
  an additional modification to the coastline that has contributed to altered 
  patterns of erosion and accretion of material.</p>
<p>Coastal erosion also renders Central Africa's coastal settlements and economic 
  activities more vulnerable to sea level rise resulting from global climate change. 
  Impacts include intrusion and contamination of freshwater sources by seawater, 
  flooding, damage to infrastructure and displacement of populations. Cameroon 
  and Gabon have low-lying lagoonal coasts which support large and growing populations, 
  as well as some unique habitats for fisheries and waterfowl habitat. Sea level 
  rise would aggravate existing problems of coastal erosion and increase the risk 
  of saltwater intrusion into surface and groundwater resources (IPCC 1998).</p>
<h4>Mitigation of coastal erosion and climate change in Central Africa</h4>
<p>Cameroon has signed the Declaration for Environmentally Sustainable Development 
  of the Large Marine Ecosystem of the Gulf of Guinea (Accra Declaration), pledging 
  political commitment to environmentally sustainable development in the Gulf 
  of Guinea. One means of enhancing environmental conditions in the Gulf is to 
  establish ICZM plans and institutions to implement policy at national level. 
  Another is to increase existing efforts to prevent and mitigate the effects 
  of coastal erosion and sea level rise, funded by international donor agencies 
  and to be implemented within the framework of the Gulf of Guinea Large Marine 
  Ecosystem Programme (see <a href="123.htm#enhancing">'Enhancing coastal and 
  marine environmental quality in Western Africa'</a> and <a href="#box2c5">Box 
  2c.5</a>). The Accra Declaration calls for improved sharing of information and 
  coordination of activities between member countries (Cameroon, and the Western 
  African States of Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo). The Declaration 
  was signed in 1998, but is not legally binding and progress has been slow. Three 
  MPAs have been established along the Central African coast with the aim of protecting 
  areas of natural habitat from modification, overharvesting, and pollution (WCMC 
  1999). As elsewhere in Africa, lack of resources and weak institutional structures 
  contribute to frequent infringement of MPAs by commercial and artisanal operations.</p>

            <p>The Gulf of Guinea coastal area (from Guinea- Bissau to Gabon) 
              is one of the world's most productive marine regions, supporting 
              80 million inhabitants through use of the fisheries, habitat, and 
              energy resources. Rivers and lagoons serve as important waterways 
              for the transportation of goods and people. The Gulf is also rich 
              in petroleum deposits, and is important globally for its marine 
              biological diversity. Unfortunately, pollution from residential 
              and industrial sources has resulted in habitat degradation, loss 
              of biological diversity and productivity, and risks to human health. 
              Coastal erosion, resulting from urbanization and clearing of mangroves 
              constitutes a further threat to the ecosystem. Large oil and gas 
              deposits make a major contribution to the region's economy, but 
              also bring additional habitat modification and pollution risks.</p>
            <p>Regional cooperation has been successful in addressing some of 
              these environmental stresses within the framework of the Gulf of 
              Guinea Large Marine Ecosystem Programme, funded by UNDP, GEF, and 
              NOAA. The programme includes the Industrial Water Pollution Control 
              and Biodiversity Conservation in the Gulf of Guinea project, in 
              which all of the programme countries have participated. This aims 
              to improve the health of the coastal waters by strengthening institutional 
              capacities for pollution prevention and remediation, developing 
              an integrated information management system, establishing a region-wide 
              ecosystem monitoring and assessment programme, identifying measures 
              to prevent and control pollution, and developing policies and strategies 
              for sustainable development of the Gulf's resources.</p>
            <p>The project has been successful in building capacity within institutions, 
              designing a regulatory policy to conserve fisheries resources, rehabilitating 
              mangroves, establishing regional effluent regulations, and in getting 
              all countries to adopt a regional integrated coastal areas management 
              programme.</p>
