<h3>RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN AFRICA </h3>
<p>African countries have responded to the challenges of environmental change 
  by ratifying international agreements, participating in regional and sub-regional 
  initiatives and programmes, and by developing National Environmental Action 
  Plans (NEAPs), Integrated Resource Management Plans (IRMP), Environmental Impact 
  Assessment (EIA) regulations, and other relevant legislation. Such responses 
  are important as they set the framework at the highest level for integration 
  of environmental issues into national governance and establish the boundaries 
  of and administrative capacity for action at national and sub-national levels. 
  African countries have some of the most advanced and coherent policies for environmental 
  management in the world and some exemplary models of public participation in 
  policy formation and decision making. However, Africa's nations must not be 
  allowed to rest on their laurels. They should be encouraged by the international 
  community to put such policies and models into practice, to monitor their effectiveness, 
  and to enforce their objectives. This will require the allocation of financial 
  resources, equipment, trained personnel, monitoring systems, administrative 
  frameworks and institutions, and the enforcement of regulations through economic 
  incentives and disincentives.</p>
<p>Regional responses include development and signature of the Lagos Plan of Action, 
  the Lusaka Agreement, the Abidjan and Nairobi Conventions, and the Accra Declaration. 
  Although some of these have experienced initial difficulties in implementation, 
  they nonetheless testify to the political recognition of the need to improve 
  environmental conditions, and to commitment to such improvement. Initiatives 
  aimed at sustainable development of shared resources-such as the Nile Basin 
  Initiative, the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Lake Victoria Environmental 
  Management Plan-are evidence of the foresight of governments and of their commitment 
  to equitable access and use of resources and to sound environmental management. 
  Furthermore, these actions set precedents for additional cooperative arrangements 
  in the areas of research, management, and mitigation of adverse impacts.</p>
<p>In addition, environmental education and awarenessraising campaigns have been 
  successfully implemented in many African countries, as evidenced by the growing 
  prominence given to environmental issues in decision making at national and 
  community level. These are positive steps, in that greater awareness in all 
  sectors of the population facilitates mainstreaming of environmental issues 
  into all activities and decisions. Creation of incentives, such as markets for 
  recycled materials and subsidizing of unleaded fuel, are urgently required to 
  sustain this momentum and turn awareness into action.</p>
