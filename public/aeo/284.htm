  Africa</i></p>
<p>The pressure on water resources increases with population growth. There is 
  a rise in water demand for agricultural and industrial production, and for the 
  urban population. The Sahelian areas are abandoned to desert encroachment. There 
  are many conflicts, linked to water issues, between breeders and agriculturists.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Eastern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Freshwater supply remains the main focus of the governments of this sub-region. 
  Measures are undertaken and investment is targeted to reduce the problems in 
  the deficit areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Increased 
  incomes from the industrial sector makes these investments possible. The concept 
  of rainfall harvesting is actively promoted in the countries of Uganda, Rwanda, 
  Burundi, Kenya and Ethiopia, where precipitation is adequate. This increases 
  freshwater access in rural areas.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Northern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>If a large increase in population is translated into higher demands for resources, 
  water is one of the most directly affected resources. In the Market Forces scenario, 
  competition for water between various sectors, especially the agricultural and 
  industrial sectors, increases, as each sector tries to manage the very limited 
  resources available. The problem of water scarcity in this sub-region only gets 
  more acute. Unsafe exploitation of groundwater resources, due to overabstraction 
  and pollution, reaches its worst levels in 2032, especially in Egypt and Libya. 
  Sea water intrusion along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea becomes a major 
  water-quality problem, and a threat to the sustainability of shallow groundwater 
  wells. Water reuse is on the increase, but the quality of the reused water poses 
  serious risks to the environment. Water recycling is not yet widely implemented, 
  due to the high cost of treating the water. The number of desalination plants 
  along the long coasts increases, but the technology is still only feasible for 
  wealthy industries, such as tourism. Water, the scarcest resource in the subregion, 
  becomes one of the factors which limits further development. A serious review 
  of the integrated water resources management programmes of the Northern African 
  countries is called for, in order to rescue the badly hit vital resource.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Southern 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>The demand for water continues to rise in response to population growth and 
  industrial development. Groundwater continues to be the dominant source of water 
  for rural people. Due to the high demand for water, wetlands continue to be 
  threatened, not only by human factors, but also by natural factors such as drought. 
  The beginnings of a sub-regional water strategy is a positive trend, which sees 
  growth in watersharing arrangements between water-rich and waterpoor countries. 
  However, the water transfers and the increased use of water storage could have 
  a negative impact on the environment. As more dams are built, there are fewer 
  natural rivers, and a substantial loss of habitat. As such, the next 30 years 
  sees: a drop in both river and dam water levels; damage to floodplains, due 
  to loss of annual flooding; and disruption to estuaries, when the mix of fresh 
  and salt water changes.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>Western 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>Most of the countries of Western Africa have a fairly good supply of freshwater. 
  Existing bodies of water are regularly supported by good annual rainfall. More 
  sophisticated management techniques and measures ensure the all-year availability 
  of freshwater in most of this sub-region. Of course, the countries that are 
  being encroached upon by the Sahara Desert apply more resources, which are assessed 
  from investments in the integrated economies of the sub-region.</p>
<p><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> <i>West 
  Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Ocean Islands Freshwater quality declines in the middle-income countries, as 
  investment in public sector services declines, and as the richer groups concentrate 
  in safe water areas or have their own purification systems. Water in the poorer 
  countries becomes a scarce commodity. Maintenance of water pumps is reduced, 
  and the growing population creates more pollution of existing water sources.</p>
