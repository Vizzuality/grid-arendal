<h2>WESTERN AFRICA</h2>
<p>Most Western African countries are well-endowed with freshwater, except for 
  those bordering on the Sahel, which frequently experience drought. Accessibility 
  to freshwater and its integrated management nonetheless remain major concerns 
  in western Africa. Inappropriate management of freshwater, and competition between 
  user groups, limit efforts by governments and the international community to 
  encourage economic development and to improve the standard of living in western 
  Africa. There are also rising concerns over freshwater quality, in terms of 
  pollution from domestic effluents and industrial wastewater, particularly in 
  the coastal zone.</p>
<h3>AVAILABILITY OF FRESHWATER IN WESTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>With the exception of Cape Verde, all the countries in the sub-region share 
  surface water resources with one or more other countries. The sub-region is 
  drained by three major basin systems. The Niger basin drains an area of 2 million 
  km<sup>2</sup> (33 per cent of the total surface area of the sub-region), and 
  involves 9 of the 16 subregional countries, including Cameroon and Chad. Other 
  important basins are: the Senegal basin, shared by four countries; the Gambia 
  basin, shared by three countries; the Bandama basin in Côte d'Ivoire; the Comoe 
  basin, shared by four countries; and the Volta basin, shared by five countries. 
  The sub-region's freshwater resources are unevenly distributed between countries. 
  Liberia, for example, has internal renewable water resources of more than 63 
  000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr, and Mauritania has only 150 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/yr 
  (UNDP and others 2000). Temporal variation in rainfall is common throughout 
  the subregion, but only those countries in the northern Sahelian zone (Mali, 
  Mauritania, and Niger) regularly experience drought, whilst countries in the 
  wetter coastal belt are periodically affected by floods.</p>
<p>Three major types of groundwater aquifers are observed in the region, namely: 
  basement aquifers; deep coastal sedimentary aquifers; and superficial aquifers. 
  The availability of groundwater varies considerably from one type of substrate 
  to another, and according to the local levels of precipitation and infiltration, 
  which determine the actual recharge. In Mauritania, for example, internal renewable 
  groundwater resources are estimated at 0.3 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (FAOSTAT 1997), 
  and these are important sources of water for domestic use, irrigation and livestock 
  watering. About 400 000 people live in the 218 oases, and are dependent on 31 
  400 wells, extracting the water manually (FAOSTAT 1997). The water is used to 
  irrigate 4 751 ha of palm trees, with 244 ha of annual crops under them (FAOSTAT 
  1997).</p>
<p>Six Western African countries are expected to experience water scarcity by 
  2025, namely: Benin; Burkina Faso; Ghana; Mauritania; Niger; and Nigeria (Johns 
  Hopkins 1998). Climate change is predicted to bring about reduced rainfall and 
  increased evaporation in the areas to the north, advancing the rate of desertification 
  in the Sahel (IPCC 2001). Countries in the coastal zone may experience more 
  intense rainfall and increased run-off. Combined with existing high rates of 
  deforestation and degradation of vegetation cover, this could have serious consequences 
  for soil erosion and agricultural productivity.</p>

<h4><a name="fig2e10"></a>Access to freshwater resources in Western Africa</h4>
<p>Demand for water has been steadily increasing in all sectors, as a result of 
  population growth; commercial agricultural expansion; and industrial development. 
  Current total withdrawal of water for domestic, industrial and agricultural 
  consumption is 11 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, and demand for water from all sectors is 
  expected to increase to some 36 km<sup>3</sup>/yr by 2025, as shown in <a href="#fig2e10">Figure 
  2e.10</a> (UNDP and others 2000, Shiklomanov 1999).</p>
<p>The Volta and Niger rivers have been dammed to supply water for irrigation 
  and domestic consumption, as well as to generate hydroelectric power. However, 
  this has created problems of accelerated erosion in the coastal zone, as well 
  as marginalization of pastoralists, who are dependent on seasonal floods (for 
  example, Acreman 1999). Despite agriculture being the largest water user, accounting 
  for 70 per cent of all withdrawals in the sub-region in 1995 (Shiklomanov 1999), 
  irrigation potential remains largely untapped, especially in the Sudano-Sahelian 
  zone, where only 16 per cent (5.3 million ha) of potentially irrigated lands 
  have been developed (Falloux and Kukendi 1988).</p>
<p>Access to piped water and sanitation also remains low, despite considerable 
  improvements during the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade 
  (1981-1990). In 2000, total water supply coverage was highest in Senegal (78 
  per cent) and lowest in Sierra Leone (23 per cent), with most urban areas in 
  the sub-region better supplied than rural areas (WHO/UNICEF 2000).</p>
