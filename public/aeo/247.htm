<h2>ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS TO HUMAN VULNERABILITY </h2>
<p>The economy is both a pressure and a victim of environmental change. The overexploitation 
  of resources for economic growth may cause environmental change, and such change 
  may, in turn, negatively impact economic performance. The 1991-92 drought which 
  hit most of Southern Africa forced the Zimbabwe stock market to decline by 62 
  per cent, causing the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to describe the 
  country as the worst performer out of 54 world stock markets. The country's 
  manufacturing sector declined by 9.3 per cent in 1992. Research shows that drought 
  caused a 25 per cent reduction in the volume of manufacturing output, and a 
  6 per cent reduction in foreign currency receipts. In South Africa, a model 
  developed by the Reserve Bank of South Africa indicated that the 1991-92 drought 
  had a net negative effect of at least US$112.4 million on the current account 
  of the balance of payments. It is estimated that about 49 000 agricultural and 
  20 000 jobs in nonagricultural sectors were lost as a result of the 1991-92 
  drought (Benson and Clay 1994).</p>
<p>There are both direct and indirect economic implications of human vulnerability 
  to environmental change which involve costs. Direct costs are dramatically illustrated 
  when losses resulting from the impacts of floods, earthquakes, wind storms or 
  fires on the infrastructure and property of the affected communities are evaluated 
  and calculated against the expenditure required to rebuild or repair lost capital 
  assets, and to provide aid and basic services to affected people. The economic 
  impacts of overharvesting natural resources, such as fish or timber, can result 
  in vulnerability as these resources, on which people depend for their livelihoods, 
  become scarce. Because the affected population has become vulnerable and has 
  lost coping capacities, such costs are usually taken up by governments, relief 
  agencies, donors and, in many cases, nearby sympathetic communities usually 
  give assistance, especially in kind.</p>
<p>At the micro-economic level, the impacts of adverse environmental change on 
  human vulnerability, as individuals and households become economically insecure, 
  result from the following: reduced productivity and production; reduced income; 
  reduced reserves; reduced purchasing power; increased demand for subsidies, 
  aid and assistance; reduced capability to pay taxes; increased indebtedness; 
  and poverty, food insecurity and health problems.</p>
<p>At the macro-economic level, the impacts of adverse environmental change follow 
  on directly from the micro-economic impacts. They include: reduced taxes to 
  the treasury; increased budget deficits; decreased social spending; increased 
  foreign aid dependency; decreased debt repayment; decreased competitiveness; 
  decreased foreign exchange; and overall poor economic performance.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has low overall economic performance, including low industrial 
  performance. The factors which contribute to the poor performance of Africa 
  and which render most of the population vulnerable to environmental change have 
  been summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> low levels of private investment due to macroeconomic instability, inadequate 
    legal systems and conflict; </li>
  <li>high tax and import duty rates which discourage foreign investment; </li>
  <li>bad governance and corruption; </li>
  <li>high levels of debt and dependence on foreign assistance; </li>
  <li>low rates of return on capital and labour; </li>
  <li>low overall productivity rates; </li>
  <li>over-valued exchange rates; </li>
  <li>poor infrastructure; and </li>
  <li>insufficient competition and monopolistic structures. (World Bank 2001a)</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be noted that the results of the above are not linear, because they 
  involve complex economic and social processes.</p>
<p>The data in <a href="#tab34">Table 3.4</a> illustrate the situation with regard 
  to dependence on foreign assistance, foreign investment and debt servicing, 
  which decrease export earnings.</p>

<p>Many African countries have persistently faced social and economic difficulties 
  since independence. Although some countries in the region depend on mineral 
  resources for their foreign exchange earnings, most of the countries rely principally 
  on agriculture which has, and continues to be, the single largest employer of 
  the population. Economic growth for most African countries has been sluggish 
  or negative and, in most instances, has impacted heavily on the welfare of the 
  people.</p>
<p>The international community has a considerable and varied involvement in social 
  and economic development in Africa. Most sub-Saharan African countries have 
  been affected by macro-economic disequilibrium, with inflation and unsustainable 
  current account deficits (Benneh and others 1996). In most countries, the balance 
  of investment has shifted to the towns, while the productive sectors of their 
  economies have continued to depend largely on the rural areas, because of their 
  dependency on agriculture.</p>
<p>While micro-economic and macro-economic problems contribute to environmental 
  change and human vulnerability, the situation is exacerbated by unresponsive 
  governance. Inappropriate domestic spending and bureaucratic inefficiencies 
  have added to the economic burden on people and the environment.</p>
