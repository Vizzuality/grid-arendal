<p>Policy responses relating to environmental governance include the decentralization 
  of management responsibilities from central to lower levels of government. They 
  also include involvement of communities in the planning and management of environmental 
  resources. In theory, and at least in the long term, decentralized environmental 
  management should be seen as the right thing to do. However, in the short term-since 
  many African governments have inadequate capacity for environmental management 
  at the centre-it is likely that this constraint will be even more pronounced 
  at lower levels of governance. There is, therefore, a need to identify mechanisms 
  for the meaningful decentralization of environmental management responsibilities, 
  including building capacity at the lower levels of administration.</p>
<p> 
<h3>IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE</h3>
<p>The history of the management of environmental goods and services indicates 
  that the 'command and control' approach (i.e. regulations and controls introduced 
  and operated by central authorities) has not been very effective unless accompanied 
  by a strong level of compliance enforcement. African countries, in search of 
  alternative approaches for better environmental management, are increasingly 
  beginning to consider economic instruments (incentives and disincentives) as 
  a tool for promoting appropriate behaviour and attitudes towards the environment. 
  However, if economic instruments are to be applied appropriately and effectively, 
  the value of environmental goods and services (among other things) needs to 
  be established, even if not very precisely, through economic evaluation of natural 
  resources. Knowledge of these values would assist political leaders in the making 
  of informed decisions as to the mechanisms needed for environmental protection 
  and for conservation of natural resources. The use of economic instruments also 
  requires that appropriate management institutions be put in place and that attitudes 
  change, something which will very probably take longer to achieve. A practical 
  approach would, therefore, be to use mixes of economic instruments and of the 
  command and control approach, adapted to individual African countries.</p>

<p><a name="img54"></a>As part of the NEAP process, African governments have developed 
  strategic action plans to facilitate the implementation of environmental policies. 
  Sectoral and cross-sectoral action plans have also been prepared (for example, 
  National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans). African countries have devoted 
  a lot of effort to the preparation of strategies and action plans. Unfortunately, 
  most of the activities specified in plans remain on paper, largely because of 
  low levels of implementation funds. There is a clear need for governments to 
  demonstrate their commitment to the environment through better allocation of 
  budgetary resources. Moreover, there is often a feeling that some strategies 
  and action plans are prepared as a direct response to the need to fulfil global, 
  regional and subregional agreements, and not as a result of careful consideration 
  of national priorities or through consensus reached with national stakeholders.</p>
<h3>PREPARATION OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLANS</h3>
<p>Regional, sub-regional, national and sub-national management plans have been 
  developed for natural resource conservation and environmental protection as 
  part of the response to combat environmental degradation. Whether for forestry, 
  biodiversity, wetlands or wildlife, governments and NGOs have prepared resource 
  management plans, sometimes with the full support and participation of local 
  communities. However, both their levels of implementation and their impacts 
  have been lower than anticipated. This begs the question as to whether such 
  plans are too ambitious, inappropriate, or have overlooked some critical assumptions. 
  In most cases, implementation of resource management plans is assumed to be 
  the responsibility of government and, given that the resource envelopes available 
  to governments are meagre and uncertain, it is not surprising that implementation 
  of such plans has suffered in the past. There is, therefore, a need to identify 
  innovative ways of relieving African governments of some of the responsibilities 
  of financing the implementation of resource management plans. For example, a 
  national NGO or community-based organization could be given a lease to manage 
  a given resource area (such as a wildlife protected area) on behalf of the government, 
  in a win-win partnership. African states could also pool resources and cooperate 
  in the preparation and implementation of natural resource management plans, 
  especially transboundary ones, where there are mutual benefits to be derived.</p>
