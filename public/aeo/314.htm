<h5>Coastal and marine resources</h5>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, there is less pressure on coastal zones 
  and lagoons. Effective integrated management leads to the sustainable use of 
  coastal and marine resources, and the sustainable use and management of marine 
  resources.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>The issue of coastal and marine erosion is reduced, as a result of to national 
  and regional policies. However, the reconstruction of damaged areas requires 
  some time.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>The coastal and marine environments are very valuable resources to Northern 
  Africa, and are well protected and managed. In the Great Transitions scenario, 
  laws regulating coastal areas are issued, and are strictly enforced. New developments 
  in sensitive areas are totally banned, and tight control is imposed on developments 
  in other areas. Protection measures include: the prohibition of any direct disposal 
  of all types of waste in the sea; rejecting licenses for projects which cause 
  sedimentation or erosion of shorelines; and issuing guidelines to boats, divers 
  and fishermen regarding safe practices in territorial waters and the protection 
  of marine life. Despite the fact that water tourism is encouraged, strict guidelines 
  for the development and management of tourism establishments in coastal areas, 
  issued in order to minimize their impacts on the coastal environment, are willingly 
  enforced.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the rates of coastal erosion are greatly 
  reduced, thanks to effective national, regional and global policies. Greater 
  environmental awareness results in the sustainable harvesting of marine resources, 
  although more time is required to replenish stocks.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>A sub-regional policy is enforced, which provides that landlocked countries 
  are as entitled to the Atlantic coast as are those actually adjoining the coast. 
  Under this policy, there is a collective responsibility: to protect the ocean 
  and waterways; to police the high sea for vessels which carry and dump hazardous 
  waste; to control fishing; to build environmentally friendly harbors; and to 
  keep beaches clean for tourism.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, a regional integration movement is revived 
  to save the marine and coastal livelihoods of in-shore fisherman. There is a 
  reawakening of interest in the development of deep-sea fishing, with the inauguration 
  of the regional shoal world integrated satellite monitoring system (SWIMS), 
  promoting fisheries and protecting endangered fish species. Equipment for detecting 
  shoal size, species mix, age and edibility has the capacity to filter metal 
  and plastic from the sea floor. This transforms coastal areas which were unregulated 
  dumping grounds for domestic and industrial waste in the sub-region.</p>
