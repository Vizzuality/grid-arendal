  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>Dualism (modern law and traditional law) in the area of land management increases 
  the pressure on land, and leads to land use conflicts in the cities as well 
  as in the countryside. The long and expensive procedures to obtain certificates 
  of occupancy for land induce real estate to drift into illegality. In high-density 
  localities, there is mass movement of people to settle elsewhere, thus sparking 
  off conflicts with the other ethnic groups. The élites increasingly invest in 
  the development of farms, in order to combat food insufficiency resulting from 
  these movements.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, land degradation outside the fortress is rampant, 
  due to overcrowding and insecure land tenure. Investment in land improvement, 
  especially outside the fortress, is very limited. Soil erosion accounts for 
  more than 90 per cent of environmental degradation in this sub-region by 2020 
  (in 2002, it accounts for about 80 per cent).</p>
<p>The land reform programmes which five countries in sub-region-namely, Uganda, 
  Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea-were pursuing are abandoned. The poor are 
  driven off the prime land into more fragile areas, such as wetlands, steep slopes 
  and semi-arid zones. Conflicts over resource use and access increases, particularly 
  in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Northern Kenya).</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>Land is overexploited and, eventually, degraded by the poor sectors of society. 
  The élite-controlled governments focus on those resources that are vital to 
  their success and well-being, with land being left mainly to the poor. With 
  the exception of relatively small areas that are well preserved by and for the 
  élite, most of the land resources are degraded, due to unsustainable practices. 
  Land use planning has become almost nonexistent, and ad hoc development spreads. 
  Allocation and access to land becomes grossly inequitable.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, in southern Africa, where land reforms are 
  either being implemented or contemplated, radical change in land ownership occurs. 
  Previously disadvantaged members of society are given the opportunity to own 
  land, but they have limited knowledge of farm operations and a lack of resources 
  to acquire inputs. As a result, land is degraded further, as a result of inappropriate 
  farm practices, while food production declines because of lack of necessary 
  inputs. On the other hand, the politically élite are better resourced, but their 
  focus is on cash farming, and this has serious implications for food security.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>The landed class acquires more and more land for commercial farming. In the 
  process, the peasant or subsistent farmers are displaced, and are forced to 
  become farm workers. The big farm owners and their families barricade themselves 
  in their luxury farm homes, protected by security guards and dogs.</p>

  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Land is devastated by warfare, civil strife, and reversion to subsistence agriculture. 
  Soil erosion continues to be a major problem, as a result of massive deforestation 
  in all areas. Some 80 per cent of the urban settlement areas of the Seychelles 
  are lost through sea level rises of two metres. Millions of hectares in Madagascar 
  are flooded by Indira, and fall out of use through civil war. Vast unplotted 
  areas of land are thought to have been laid with mines.</p>
