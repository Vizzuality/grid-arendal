<a name="img31"></a>The environment is always in a state of flux and has, therefore, 
always impacted on people and the way they live. The history of humankind abounds 
with examples of environmental change which have affected civilizations, or which 
have provided lasting lessons as to how people have been impacted by such change. 
<p>In an early example, the pioneering organized foodproducing systems in the 
  Nile Valley, under the civilization which ruled ancient Egypt for two and a 
  half millennia from about 5 000 years ago, collapsed after its population peaked. 
  A decline in food production was experienced due to environmental change as 
  a result of massive flooding of the River Nile, which was catastrophic downstream. 
  The river was also transformed over 500 years as heavy rains in the upper catchment 
  area produced more vegetation, reducing erosion and sediment carried downstream. 
  This led to the reduction of the floodplain, and quantities of plant foods declined. 
  'The levels to which the human population had soared could not be sustained, 
  and the pressure on resources mounted inexorably. Competition for food intensified, 
  doubtless provoking conflict of which the massacre at Jebel Sahaba is probably 
  an extreme example' (Reader 1997).</p>
<p>A more recent example involves climate variability, an issue highlighted by 
  the WCED, which reported that: 'human overuse of land and prolonged drought 
  threaten to turn the grasslands of Africa's Sahel region into desert. No other 
  region more tragically suffers the vicious cycle of poverty leading to environmental 
  degradation, which leads in turn to even greater poverty' (WCED 1987).</p>

<p>Africa's biophysical and socio-economic characteristics, and the complexity 
  of its cultural diversity, are some of the factors or driving forces which contribute 
  to environmental change which, in turn, impacts on human vulnerability and security. 
  The Africa region is characterized by diverse patterns of elevation, geology, 
  climatic variability and vegetation types. Millions of people in most parts 
  of Africa are directly dependent on natural resources of the physical environment. 
  They are, therefore, more vulnerable to environmental change than people in 
  other regions of the world. It is important to note that people in all regions 
  in the world are vulnerable in one way or another to environmental change, but 
  that their coping capacity is different. For example, in 1999, between two and 
  three times as many disaster events were reported in the United States than 
  in India or Bangladesh. However, there were 14 times more deaths in India and 
  34 times more deaths in Bangladesh than in the United States in that year. Equally 
  surprising is the fact that lightning causes more deaths in an average year 
  in the United States than do floods, forest fires or tornadoes.</p>
<p>Environmentally unsustainable and inappropriate practices, such as unsuitable 
  agricultural methods, deforestation and water pollution, are the major humaninduced 
  causes of vulnerability to environmental change. These are exacerbated by the 
  impacts of climatic variations and interacting with the unique biophysical dynamics, 
  thereby reducing coping capacities for most of the people who are already living 
  in environmentally fragile areas.</p>

            <p>In 1994, the UN Human Development Report introduced the concept 
              of human security, predicating it on the dual notion of, on the 
              one hand, safety from chronic threats of hunger, disease and repression 
              and, on the other hand, protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions 
              in daily life. Environmental insecurity became shorthand for the 
              dimension of human insecurity induced by the combined effects of 
              natural disasters and mismanaged environmental endowment.</p>

<p><a name="box33"></a>For the purpose of this chapter, human vulnerability/security 
  (see <a href="#box33">Box 3.3</a>) is considered as a continuous variable, whereby 
  vulnerability is the negative part of the continuum and security is the positive 
  part. The two major constituent themes of human vulnerability are exposure to 
  environmental hazards (or contingencies, shocks and stresses) and the coping 
  capability of people which assures them of security. </p>
<p>People who have more capability to cope with extreme events or stresses are 
  at lesser risk and are, therefore, more secure. The stresses to which an individual 
  or household, or a broader social or geographic sub-region or region, are subjected 
  are reflected in the state of helplessness or the lack of means to cope with 
  risks, shocks, stresses or demands (Edralin undated). For example, many African 
  countries in arid and semi-arid areas depend on food aid during some parts of 
  the year. In 2000, for example, 8 million people in Ethiopia faced severe food 
  shortages and had to depend on food aid (ELCA 2000). This was mainly due to 
  adverse weather conditions and the impact upon food production.</p>

<p><a name="fig31"></a>Human vulnerability/security is a continuum which is characterized 
  by situations which range from the undesirable state of vulnerability and its 
  characteristics to the desirable state of security and its characteristics, 
  as depicted in the <a href="#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>.</p>
<p>The human vulnerability/security continuum shows how vulnerability and security 
  are defined in terms of coping capacity. Coping capacity increases as you move 
  from the state of vulnerability towards security and vice versa, along the continuum. 
  People, as individuals or as a community, will be at different stages of the 
  vulnerability/security continuum depending on the socio-economic situation of 
  each individual or group.</p>
<p>Individuals or groups within the vulnerability/ security continuum can be classified, 
  in very simple terms, as falling under one of four categories along the gradations 
  of the continuum: </p>
<ul>
  <li>high risk and low coping capacity; </li>
  <li>high risk and high coping capacity; </li>
  <li>low risk and low coping capacity; or </li>
  <li>low risk and high coping capacity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Most African countries fall under the category of high risk and low coping 
  capacity. This is because most countries in Africa over the past 30 years have 
  been at high risk of, for example, floods, earthquakes, lava flows, fires, droughts, 
  civil strife, and armed conflicts and wars, which have increased poverty, exacerbated 
  serious health problems and resulted in hunger. These disasters have displaced 
  populations across national borders and internally, contributing to further 
  environmental degradation, and leading to more vulnerability and insecurity. 
  The impacts have mostly affected the poor, who have low coping capacities.</p>
<p>The high risk and high coping capacity scenario is very rare in Africa. The 
  United States falls under this scenario. Some areas of the United States are 
  at high risk from earthquakes, for example, but impacts, particularly in terms 
  of human casualties, are low. Only pockets of Africa fall under the low risk 
  and low coping capacity. Where natural causes of risks are absent, human-induced 
  changes will be present to make people vulnerable. In any circumstances in Africa 
  for now, the scenario of low coping capacities exists. The low risk and high 
  coping capacity scenario is the ideal.</p>
<p>Vulnerability is also a reflection of human capacity to cope with risks or 
  shocks. Those who are least vulnerable cope the best and enjoy security, while 
  the opposite applies to those households, communities or broader populations 
  who are most vulnerable and who stand to lose the most from the effects of environmental 
  change and other risks, shocks or stresses. Coping strategies have many dimensions, 
  from the traditional to the scientific. Traditional communities in Africa have, 
  for millennia, adapted to environmental change in different ways, including 
  shifts in livelihood activities according to seasons and changes in the environment. 
  They have also managed resources in a sustainable manner, adopting various management 
  regimes to avoid overexploitation and to enhance their own food security (see 
  <a href="#box34">Box 3.4</a>).</p>

            <p>The fisherman who throws some of his catch into the sea after a

              he has, as a member of the community, in ensuring that the fish 
              population in the sea is not depleted. He, therefore, throws some 
              of the live fish back into the sea so that they may continue to 
              breed. And so each time he goes fishing, there will be fish in the 
              sea.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the fisherman is expressing gratitude to Bosompo, 
              the divinity of the sea, for giving him some of his fish. If the 
              fisherman does not give back some of his catch to Bosompo, he will 
              feel that he has been negligent of an important cultural value-gratitude. 
              The fisherman's action is based on the proverb:'Bosompo ankame wo 
              nam a,wo nso wonkame no abia'-'If the divinity of the sea does not 
              begrudge you of his fish, you do not begrudge him of your catch.'</p>
            <p>And so,while the fisherman is expressing gratitude in conformity 
              with a cultural value dating from antiquity, he is also expressing 
              a concern for the environment by ensuring that there continue to 
              be fish in the ocean and by acknowledging that human beings are 
              responsible for their environment.</p>

<p>Human vulnerability/security is a complex phenomenon with many interacting 
  dimensions with respect to environmental change, and the resulting human responses 
  and ability to cope with the impacts of such change. For example, desertification 
  and drought are directly linked to poverty, food and water shortages, conflict 
  and mass migration. They increase the risk of fire, decrease the availability 
  of fuel and limit access to health care. Health effects can include malnutrition, 
  the failure of babies to develop properly, iron and Vitamin A deficiency, infections, 
  blindness and anaemia (Diallo 2000). Women and children are particularly vulnerable. 
  In Africa, 49 per cent of the deaths among children under 5 years of age are 
  associated with malnutrition. A WHO estimate put the number of such deaths in 
  Africa at 3.8 million in 1999 (WHO 2000). As water sources dry up, people are 
  forced to use heavily polluted water, leading to severe epidemics. In particular, 
  desertification and droughts can increase water-related diseases such as cholera, 
  typhoid, hepatitis A and diarrhoeal diseases (Menne 2000).</p>

<p><a name="box35"></a>The dimensions of human vulnerability analysed in this 
  chapter also include social and economic aspects, that is, poverty, food security, 
  health, civil strife/conflicts, economic dimensions and governance. These complex, 
  interacting dimensions of vulnerability to environmental change can act either 
  as the constituent elements of vulnerability or, depending on the coping capacities 
  (see <a href="#box35">Box 3.5</a>) and resilience of an affected population, 
  can result from, or be exacerbated by, environmental change. Interventions addressing 
  human vulnerability to environmental change must be translated into integrated 
  responses which reflect the inter-sectoral nature and processes of the causes 
  and states of vulnerability. Because human security depends on the effectiveness 
  of sustainable environmental management and the reduction of human vulnerability 
  to environmental change and threats, responses aimed to address disasters should 
  be quick, adequate and coordinated (UNDP 1994).</p>
<p>The poor are especially vulnerable to degradation of natural systems. Both 
  the global and the local consequences of environmental damage directly affect 
  poor people. Global concerns, such as changes in the Earth's atmosphere, are 
  critical to the livelihoods of poor people, and their consequences last longer 
  than first assumed. For example, a rate of climate change is likely to cause 
  widespread economic, social and environmental degradation over the next century. 
  Therefore, the poorest people in Africa and other developing regions are certain 
  to suffer the most due to failing harvests, growing water shortages and rising 
  sea levels.</p>
