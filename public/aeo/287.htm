<h3>THE POLICY REFORM SCENARIO</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The beginning of the millennium saw a renewed commitment to address issues 
  of sustainability and the environment. A consensus emerged on the urgent need 
  to temper what had come to be called the Market Forces scenario, with policies 
  to secure environmental resilience and to sharply reduce poverty. The Policy 
  Reform scenario is not a radical deviation from the Conventional Development 
  scenario. The emphasis on economic growth, trade liberalization, privatization 
  and modernization endures. The integration of the global economy proceeds apace, 
  as poorer regions converge very gradually toward the model of development of 
  the rich countries. The values of individualism and consumerism persist, transnational 
  corporations continue to dominate the global economy, and governments modernize 
  their economies and social welfare structures. The defining feature of the Policy 
  Reform scenario is the emergence of the political will to constrain market-driven 
  growth with a comprehensive set of sustainability policies.</p>
<p>The Policy Reform scenario is based on a set of social and environmental goals 
  adopted by the international community. These guidelines are adjusted periodically 
  in light of new information. Social and environmental targets are set at global, 
  regional and national levels, and include a mix of economic reform, regulatory 
  instruments, voluntary actions, social programmes and technology development.</p>
<p>Unlike the Market Forces scenario, the Policy Reform scenario tempers market-driven 
  prescriptions with strong social and environmental policies. It thrives on the 
  harmony between different stakeholders and otherwise divergent policies. It 
  is consistent with development which the Managing Director of the IMF, Michel 
  Camdessus, said not only promotes liberalization of trade and capital movements, 
  but also emphasizes transparency, accountability, democratic governance, fighting 
  corruption, alleviating poverty, gender equality, increasing aid, debt relief 
  and market access to developing countries (Raghavan 2000).</p>
<p>The assumptions of the Policy Reform scenario may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is similar in many ways to the Market Forces scenario. </li>
  <li>It is based on a set of social and environmental goals adopted by the international 
    community, and set at global, regional and national levels. </li>
  <li>There is an emergence of the political will to constrain and to guide market-driven 
    growth with a comprehensive set of sustainability policies. </li>
  <li>Policy initiatives for achieving goals are regionally differentiated, but 
    include a mix of economic reform, regulatory instruments, voluntary actions, 
    social programmes and technological development. </li>
  <li>The 'western' model still prevails, and 'western' values still spread.</li>
  <li>There is less trust in automatic positive results from markets, and more 
    emphasis on targeted policies.</li>
</ul>
