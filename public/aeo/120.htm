<h2><a name="img2c11"></a>WESTERN AFRICA </h2>
Coastal erosion and the risk of sea level rise are the most serious issues facing 
coastal countries in Western Africa. However, there are also concerns over unsustainable 
harvesting patterns and rising levels of pollution. 
<h4>Economic, social and ecological value of coastal and marine environments in 
  Western Africa</h4>
<p>The coast of Western Africa spans a broad range of habitats and biota, including 
  the pristine islands of the Bijagos Archipelago and the islands of Cape Verde. 
  Ecosystems and resources are diverse, including abundant mangrove forests, sandy 
  beaches, lagoons, coastal wetlands, and plentiful fisheries. Nearly 200 fish 
  species were recorded in the area between 1950 and 1994 and there are a total 
  of 22 local countries and 25 foreign fishing nations (FAO 1997). It is estimated 
  that over half a million people in Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal depend 
  directly on fisheries for incomes and food supply (IPS 2001). There are approximately 
  6.5 million hectares of mangroves (mainly <i>Rhizophora spp.</i>) along the 
  coast of Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria, providing habitat for fish, 
  crustaceans, molluscs and water birds (Akpabli 2000)</p>
<p>Storm surges are common along the coast, and patterns of erosion and accretion 
  are highly dynamic. The protection afforded by the mangroves and other coastal 
  wetlands is therefore vital in stabilizing the coastal zone and enabling infrastructure 
  and development.</p>
<p>There are abundant oil and gas reserves off the Western African coast, especially 
  around the Niger Delta, as well as mineral deposits (including placer minerals 
  in Sierra Leone) and abundant sand, gravel and limestone, as well as opportunities 
  for shipping and tourism activities.</p>
<p>Population pressures are among the factors that have and will continue to contribute 
  to substantial resource degradation in the coastal zones of Western Africa. 
  For example, in Ghana, 35 per cent of the population live on the coast, and 
  60 per cent of industry is concentrated in the Accra-Tema metropolis (Chidi 
  Ibe 1996). In Nigeria, about 20 million people (22.6 per cent of the country's 
  population) live along the coastal zone, and 13 million people live in the coastal 
  capital of Lagos which is also the centre for 85 per cent of the country's industrial 
  activity (UNCHS 2001, Chidi Ibe 1996). The coastal region of Dakar (Senegal) 
  is home to about 4.5 million people (66.6 per cent of Senegal's population) 
  and 90 per cent of the country's industries (IPCC 1998). The coastal population 
  in Western Africa is likely to rise to about 20 million by 2020, through growth 
  of existing coastal populations and migration from inland areas (Snrech, Cour, 
  De Lattre & Naudet 1994).</p>
<p>Traditionally, opportunities for agriculture and employment in the more humid 
  coastal areas have encouraged steady migrations from the Sudano- Sahelian area 
  towards the coast. Much of the coastal rain forest has been cleared to make 
  way for agricultural plantations and urban development and what remains is decreasing 
  at an annual rate of between 2 and 5 per cent (World Bank 1996b). Fragile coastal 
  ecosystems, such as the stretch of coast between Accra (Ghana) and the Niger 
  Delta (Nigeria), are under further stress because of increasing demand for resources 
  compounded by industrial and urban development and their associated pollution 
  loads.</p>
