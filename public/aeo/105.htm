<h2>EASTERN AFRICA </h2>
<p>The issues facing the coastal Eastern African countries are erosion and pollution 
  of coastal and marine environments, as well as harvesting pressures resulting 
  from rapid population growth in the coastal zone and expansion of the tourism 
  industry. Rises in sea level and in temperature resulting from global climate 
  change are also emerging as issues of concern.</p>
<h3>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS IN 
  EASTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The Eastern African coast supports a diversity of ecosystems including dry 
  coastal forests, coastal dunes, floodplains, freshwater and saltwater marshes, 
  mangrove forests, coral reefs, lagoons, sandy beaches and rocky shores. These 
  support a rich and diverse resource base, including fish and seafood, construction 
  materials, energy sources, wildlife habitat and tourism opportunities, as well 
  as industrial and transportation activities.</p>
<p>The Red Sea coral reefs off the coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia are 
  in good, often pristine, condition with 30-50 per cent live coral cover and 
  the richest diversity of coral and other reef species in the entire Indian Ocean 
  (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 2000).</p>
<p>Rich mangrove forests not only protect the shoreline from storm surges and 
  buffeting by ocean swell, but are also breeding grounds for many species of 
  waterbirds. Along the coast of Kenya and southern Somalia, mangroves support 
  commercial crab, oyster, and mullet fisheries, as well as artisanal harvesting 
  of these and other species. These are extremely important to local economies 
  and to many communities where fish is almost the sole source of animal protein 
  (FAO 1997).</p>
<p>The natural assets of the Eastern African coast make it an ideal tourist destination. 
  Kenya's tourism industry is the country's second largest earner of foreign exchange, 
  contributing 19 per cent to GDP (World Bank 2000). In addition, the larger scale 
  fisheries and associated industries provide a valuable source of foreign exchange 
  and make a significant contribution to GDP.</p>
