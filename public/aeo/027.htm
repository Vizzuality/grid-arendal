<h4>Sub-regional policy responses and actions</h4>
<p>Many of Africa's policy responses to the environmental issues and challenges 
  of the 1972 Stockholm Conference and the 1992 Earth Summit are found in the 
  various sub-regional frameworks and agreements that have been developed since 
  1972. These responses are based on sub-regional political and economic groupings 
  and priorities.</p>
<h5>Central Africa</h5>
The Central African sub-region has a number of economic units, namely: the Economic 
and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC); the Economic Community of Central 
African States (ECCAS); the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC); and the African 
Timber Organization (ATO). The primary aim of these organizations is to promote 
economic cooperation and sound environmental management in the sub-region. In 
the past three decades, Central Africa has also seen the emergence of intergovernmental 
organizations responsible for the development and management of shared rivers 
in the sub-region. However, the performance of these institutions remains far 
below their potential. Part of the underperformance of the sub-region's institutions 
relate to governance. Furthermore, much of Central Africa is, or has been, involved 
in civil war at one time or another, and this has affected the progress of policy 
responses. Poverty and lack of cooperation have also combined to affect the progress 
and success of sub-regional efforts. 
<h5>Eastern Africa</h5>
<p>In Eastern Africa, policy responses have largely been based on ecosystems, 
  rather than political and economic groupings. A number of sub-regional initiatives 
  have been developed and implemented, including: the Eastern Africa Biodiversity 
  Support Programme; the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI); the Eastern Africa Wetlands 
  Programme; Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM); and the Lake Victoria 
  Global Environment Facility (GEF) Project. The Eastern African Convention on 
  the Protection of Coastal and Marine Environment has been very important in 
  bringing together the coastal countries of the sub-region to discuss and address 
  issues of common interest. The Nile Basin Initiative is one of the most successful 
  regional initiatives. It has 21 projects, whose main focus is: integrated water 
  resources planning and management; capacity building; training; harmonization 
  of legislation; and environmental protection. Famine and civil strife have slowed 
  down the progress of Eastern Africa's environmental policy responses. Despite 
  the presence of the East Africa Economic Community (EAEC), regional integration 
  and cooperation in Eastern Africa has been weak. The frameworks for cooperation 
  are generally limited in the sub-region. </p>
<h5>Northern Africa</h5>
<p>In <i>Agenda 21</i>, UNCED adopted the river basin as the unit of analysis 
  for integrated water resources management (IWRM). Since then, Northern African 
  has started to create an enabling environment for IWRM, including formulation 
  of the legal framework governing the development and preservation of freshwater 
  resources and of the institutional framework for conducting this approach.</p>
<p>At the multinational level, the NBI is an excellent example of cooperation 
  within the framework of IWRM between and among the ten Nile riparian states. 
  The Joint Authority for the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer is another example of cooperation, 
  between Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan (CEDARE 2000).</p>
<h5>Southern Africa</h5>
<p>The SADC formulated a Regional Policy and Strategy for Food, Agriculture and 
  Natural Resources in the 1990s. The main aim of this regional policy and strategy 
  is to ensure the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources, and their 
  effective management and conservation. It incorporates environmental considerations 
  in all policies and programmes, and integrates the sustainable use of natural 
  resources with development needs. Other environmental policies that have been 
  put in place in the sub-region include: the SADC Wildlife Policy; the SADC Wildlife 
  Protocol; the Forestry Sector Policy and Development Strategy; the Protocol 
  on Shared Watercourse Systems; the Southern African Power Pool; and the Southern 
  Africa Trade Protocol. Running parallel to these initiatives are other important 
  sub-regional responses, including: the SADC Environmental Information Systems 
  Programme; the SADC Wetlands Conservation Programme; the SADC Environmental 
  Education Programme; and the Southern Africa Biodiversity Support Programme. 
  Although regional frameworks for coordination and cooperation exist on paper, 
  their implementation on the ground has been weak, as a result of lack of funding 
  and institutional problems.</p>
<h5>Western Africa</h5>
<p>ECOWAS brings together Western African countries as a single grouping and sub-region. 
  Most of the policy responses to environmental issues in Western Africa have 
  been at the national level. However, a few initiatives have been taken, based 
  on river basins and ecosystems. These include: the creation of river basin authorities 
  in the Senegal, Gambia and Niger basins; and the West Africa Wetlands Programme, 
  supported by the IUCN and Wetlands International. One of the oldest African 
  intergovernmental organizations, the Niger River Basin Authority, is in Western 
  Africa. The main aim of this authority, and of numerous others in the sub-region, 
  is to promote cooperation among member countries and to ensure integrated development 
  in the river basins.</p>
<h5>West Indian Ocean Islands</h5>
<p>Policy responses are few in the West Indian Ocean Islands sub-region, with 
  the exception of an environmental education programme. An ICZM programme, a 
  five-year project supported by the European Union, is being implemented. The 
  goal of the programme is to enable the sustainable development of coastal zones. 
  In addition to this programme, other sub-regional projects, funded by GEF, include: 
  the Western Indian Ocean Marine Biodiversity Conservation programme; the transboundary 
  Diagnostic Analysis and Strategic Action Plan for Marine and Coastal Environments; 
  and the Western Indian Ocean Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project. Due to 
  the isolated nature of the countries in this sub-region, environmental responses 
  at the sub-regional level are few. Apart from the common problem of the seas, 
  there are few common agendas. Funding is also a problem within the sub-region.</p>
<h4>National responses and actions</h4>
<p>Africa's policy responses to environmental concerns are most pronounced at 
  the national level. The policy responses vary from one country to another, depending 
  on the priority environmental issues. In most countries, the responses take 
  the form of: policy frameworks; resource use planning regulations; public awareness 
  programmes; and the promotion of private sector involvement in natural resources 
  management issues.</p>
<p>National Environment Action Plans (NEAPs), National Conservation Strategies 
  (NCSs), National Plans of Action to Combat Desertification (NPACDs), National 
  Tr opical Forestry Action Plans (NTFPAs), Country Environmental Strategy Papers 
  (CESPs), National Energy Assessments and Country Programmes for the Phasing 
  out of Ozone-Depleting Substances under the Montreal Protocol are playing significant 
  roles in integrating environment and development in many African countries. 
  At present, about 80 per cent of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa are involved 
  in the NEAP process, and other countries are preparing or implementing similar 
  kinds of environmental strategies (World Bank 1995).</p>
<p>Success stories continue to be seen in Africa, especially with regard to moving 
  towards strengthening the institutional frameworks that deal with the environment. 
  High-level coordination for environmental management has been created in some 
  countries, such as: Benin, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, 
  Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, the Gambia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
  EIAs have also been implemented in many countries, and EIA guidelines and procedures 
  are being prepared as a follow-up to appropriate legislation.</p>
