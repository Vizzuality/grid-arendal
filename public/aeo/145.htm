<h4>Towards sustainable management and conservation of forests and woodlands in 
  Western Africa</h4>
<p>European settlers built the foundation for modern management of forests in 
  almost all of the countries of the sub-region. When these countries gained their 
  independence (about 40 years ago), they inherited forest and wildlife resource 
  management systems institutionalized in the form of state-owned protected areas. 
  Forest in protected areas ranges from 77 per cent in Niger to 1 per cent in 
  Guinea-Bissau and Liberia (FAO 2001a). Conservation International has been largely 
  instrumental in developing and implementing management programmes aimed at conserving 
  the fragmented Upper Guinea Forest hotspot. Activities have included environmental 
  assessments and prioritization of conservation needs, building capacity in natural 
  resources management agencies, employment creation for local communities in 
  ranger activities, and tourism development (Conservation International 2001). 
  Other responses include large-scale reforestation programmes, although these 
  have encountered difficulties in implementation. New approaches built around 
  'grass-roots projects' have been introduced in some countries, putting more 
  emphasis on community-level enterprises (Compaoré, Issaka & Yacouba 2000). Re-introduction 
  and mainstreaming of indigenous forest conservation practices have also been 
  successful in some parts of Western Africa (see <a href="#box2d8">Box 2d.8</a>).</p>

            <p>In Sierra Leone, farmers normally leave tree cover at a distance 
              of 3-5m from footpaths in order to maintain a continuum of shade 
              for those using the paths during the peak of the hot season from 
              March to April. Also, the clearing of a farm site normally excludes 
              forest fringe vegetation in order to encourage wildlife and fish 
              reproduction, and also to define a boundary between common property 
              and farmers' fields. These practices could form the basis for the 
              use of traditional knowledge in forestry in development modern strategies 
              for conservation.</p>

<p>From the 1980s, the sub-region saw the appearance of projects related to the 
  management of natural forests through the preparation and implementation of 
  Forest Management Plans and Strategies. Also, in response to the Tropical Forest 
  Action Plan, many Western African countries have initiated major forestry sector 
  reviews in the past 10 years. Criteria and indicators for sustainable forest 
  management are being developed and implemented in all Western African countries 
  with the exceptions of Benin, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, coordinated by the ATO. 
  Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Togo have some of their forests under management 
  plans (FAO 2001a). In October 2000, the ATO announced its intentions to coordinate 
  a common system of certification for timber and forest products, to ensure customers 
  that the timber has come from sustainably managed forests.</p>
<p>Policy measures to reduce the pressures on forests and woodlands from fuelwood 
  collection and charcoal production include the development and expansion of 
  energy generation from renewable resources (such as hydropower and solar power), 
  as well as through centralized power generation from fossil fuels using cleaner 
  technologies. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developing countries in Africa will 
  receive funds for development and adoption of cleaner technologies as well as 
  for tree-planting and afforestation programmes.</p>
