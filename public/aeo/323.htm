<p><a name="img53"> </a>The majority of African states have ratified the MEAs 
  that are of relevance to the region, at both global and regional levels. MEAs 
  are recognized as the primary instruments for state commitment to the pursuit 
  of sustainable development (UNEP/ SIDA 1996). The main MEAs of the past two 
  decades have covered areas of critical importance for the management of environmental 
  resources. They include: new and additional resources for environmental programmes; 
  technology transfer; mechanisms for addressing vital matters such as the loss 
  of biological diversity and poverty alleviation; and institutional frameworks 
  for dealing with environment and development concerns (UNEP/SIDA 1996). Although 
  the various global agreements clearly give grounds for hope where management 
  of the environment is concerned, actual achievements have been very limited 
  (UNEP/SIDA 1996). The agreements signify a collective will to address environmental 
  problems, but many African countries have been unable to benefit from the full 
  potential offered by the global MEAs, and have even found themselves unable 
  to effectively implement the necessary provisions of the MEAs they have ratified 
  (UNEP/SIDA 1996). Furthermore, even regional and subregional environmental agreements 
  have been difficult to operate, largely due to lack of adequate and sustainable 
  financial and human resources. Examples are the Abidjan and Nairobi conventions. 
  Both of these were developed in the 1980s under the auspices of UNEP's Regional 
  Seas Programme. However, the Nairobi Convention took 11 years to come into force 
  and neither convention succeeded in establishing a fully </p>
<p>operational Regional Coordinating Unit (RCU). Under impetus from African governments, 
  UNEP is now taking steps to compensate for these delays and shortcomings and 
  a Joint Secretariat for the conventions has been set up to coordinate and build 
  synergies between ongoing projects and programmes in Central, Western and Eastern 
  Africa. But success has also been achieved, when financial assistance has been 
  made available. An example is the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Launched in 1999, 
  the NBI is an initiative on the part of the riparian countries to establish 
  a basin-wide framework to fight poverty and promote economic development in 
  the Nile Basin area. The Nile Basin is home to around 160 million people and, 
  although it has a rich natural endowment of high mountains, tropical forests, 
  woodlands, lakes, savannas, wetlands, arid lands and deserts, it is characterized 
  by poverty, instability and environmental degradation. Furthermore, its population 
  is expected to double in the next 25 years placing, increasing the stress on 
  water and other natural resources. The NBI is based on a shared underlying vision, 
  'to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable utilization 
  of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources.</p>
<p>And, finally, there are more than 500 multilateral agreements in existence 
  and, while African countries are not signatories to them all, the sheer number 
  of agreements is too great to be managed by African countries with small economic 
  bases.</p>

<p>African states are participating actively in various international fora aimed 
  at developing collective responsibility for the environment. This is the case 
  of the MEAs, which the majority of African countries have ratified under impetus 
  from AMCEN and with technical support from UNEP. The decision of African states 
  to establish AMCEN was a key enabling factor for improvement of environmental 
  management in Africa and for successful policy response. AMCEN's efforts have 
  been further strengthened by sub-regional organizations devoted to economic 
  cooperation and environmental management.</p>
Considering the number of regional and subregional groupings, Africans appreciate 
the contributions of these organizations to economic development and environmental 
management. Unfortunately, many of them lack financial sustainability. It is, 
therefore, critical that suitable institutional capacity-building and financial 
mechanisms be developed for these organizations. 
<h3>INTRODUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS</h3>
<p>Perhaps the greatest effort in policy responses to combat environmental degradation 
  in Africa has been in the area of environmental policy and legal reform. Not 
  long ago, most African countries had limited institutional instruments for environmental 
  management, or had instruments that were outdated or sectoral and, therefore, 
  narrowly focused. The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) processes adopted 
  by some African countries have allowed them to formulate relevant environmental 
  policies and to enact new laws. New environmental policies have also provided 
  guidance for the formulation or review of sectoral policies and, subsequently, 
  of laws.</p>
<p>There are a great many policies, laws and regulations in place in most African 
  countries which, at first sight, should provide a sufficient basis for sound 
  environmental management. More could be formulated or drafted if need be, although 
  more policies does not necessarily mean better environmental management. However, 
  the fact that Africa's environment continues to deteriorate in spite of such 
  a substantial body of policies, laws and regulations may be an indicator of 
  a low level of implementation and, particularly, of enforcement. The sectoral 
  approach to environmental management often results in contradictory laws. However, 
  other problems, such as inadequate finances and human resources capacity, hinder 
  effective implementation.</p>
<p>Although African states have improved the policy framework for more effective 
  management of the environment, there is need for more. For example, there is 
  a need to develop policies governing the management of transboundary resources, 
  and a need to ensure that the policies of neighbouring countries are in harmony 
  with one another. Other policy gaps include frameworks for access to genetic 
  resources and the management of indigenous knowledge.</p>

<p>New environmental laws have also facilitated the creation of institutions responsible 
  for coordinating, supervising and monitoring environmental management in African 
  countries. Horizontally, these relate to the various sectoral agencies of government; 
  vertically, they relate to lower levels of government and civil society. African 
  countries are investing heavily in building the institutional capacity for better 
  environmental management. New institutions have been created and, sometimes, 
  old ones rehabilitated. However, many of these countries are experiencing significant 
  shortages of skilled personnel, partly as a result of the 'brain drain'. Some 
  of the poorer countries, such as Uganda, have embarked on Universal Primary 
  Education (NEMA 2001), but such commendable efforts will take time to yield 
  results. There is, therefore, a need to provide training opportunities for those 
  in the relevant institutions to fill the skills gap in the short and medium 
  terms. African countries will also need to address the 'brain drain' issue, 
  by offering their trained personnel meaningful employment opportunities and 
  better working conditions.</p>
<p>While the new national institutions for environmental management represent 
  significant improvements over the previous ones, the viability of some of them 
  is questionable because of heavy reliance on external financing. A number are 
  currently being financed through Official Development Assistance (ODA) from 
  bodies such as the World Bank. Mechanisms are therefore needed to make these 
  institutions financially self-sustaining. Also, by their very nature as national 
  institutions, the new agencies have a limited capacity to address sub-regional 
  and crossborder environmental issues. While sub-regional environment and development 
  organizations such as the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development 
  (IGAD) exist, they too are, to some extent, limited by their mandates. Africa 
  needs a strong institution that can negotiate, lobby and monitor and, at the 
  same time, encourage harmonization of environmental management approaches. Such 
  an institution, which could possibly be an arm of AMCEN, currently does not 
  exist.</p>
