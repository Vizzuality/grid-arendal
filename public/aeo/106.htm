<h3>COASTAL EROSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN EASTERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Erosion is a common phenomenon along the Eastern African coast (UNESCO 1997, 
  Ngoile 1997). Human activities, including beachfront developments, and mining 
  of sand, coral and lime, contribute to accelerated rates of erosion. Activities 
  inland-such as clearing and draining water catchments and river basins for agriculture 
  and aquaculture, and clear-felling of coastal and inland forests-are additional 
  causes of accelerated erosion.</p>
<p>Residential areas have expanded and commercial developments such as hotels 
  and resorts have been constructed rapidly and widely along the coast of Eastern 
  Africa, from southern Sudan to Kenya, often without adequate planning or provision 
  of basic services such as waste disposal and sanitation. Many developments are 
  concentrated on beaches and sea fronts, to benefit from the clean beaches, clean 
  lagoon waters, and healthy coral reefs, and to attract as many visitors as possible. 
  Excavation of sand, limestone, coral stone, and other building materials, as 
  well as clearance of natural habitat to make way for urban and commercial developments 
  contribute to coastal erosion. Coastal development in Somalia has been suspended 
  after the collapse of the government, but as peace and stability return, it 
  is expected that coastal development will be accelerated (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 
  2000).</p>
<p>Erosion in one area leads to accretion of material in other areas, resulting 
  in shifting coastal features (e.g. dunes, beaches, cliffs, and shoreline). For 
  example, the Tana Delta and Sabaki Estuary (Kenya) have accreted extensive coastal 
  plains due to coastal drift and the high sediment loads carried by the Tana 
  and Sabaki Rivers. These high sediment loads are a result of poor land use practices 
  in their upper catchments and high rates of soil erosion from their agricultural 
  lands. Such a high rate of sediment discharge is threatening the ecological 
  integrity of marine and coastal habitats such as mangroves, seagrass meadows 
  and coral reefs. In addition, the high concentrations of silt in river water 
  make the rivers unattractive for recreational purposes and limit the extent 
  to which the water can be used for other purposes (UNEP 1998a). Furthermore, 
  dams upstream on the Tana River have reduced water flows reaching the delta 
  and lowered frequency of flooding, causing die-off in coastal forests (International 
  Rivers Network 1995-2000).</p>
<p>Coastal erosion also threatens the breeding and nursery grounds of marine species, 
  some of which are listed as endangered. Five sea turtle species recorded in 
  the Western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, and the cetacean <i>Dugong dugon </i>are 
  threatened with extinction because of loss of breeding and nursery grounds (IUCN 
  1998). The breeding sites for turtles have been excavated, built on, or simply 
  washed bare.</p>
<p>The impacts of erosion and shoreline retreat in Eastern Africa are likely to 
  be compounded by sea level rise resulting from global climate change. Sea level 
  rise will increase the intrusion of seawater and flooding as most of the low-lying 
  coastal plains are just a few metres above the highest spring tide water level 
  (Okemwa, Ntiba & Sherman 1995). A rise of one metre would result in damage to 
  or loss of infrastructure and natural habitats, which in turn would reduce economic 
  potential of tourism and other commercial ventures and displace hundreds of 
  thousands of people, especially in coastal cities such as Mombasa (IPCC 1998).</p>
<p>Sea temperatures are also predicted to increase in certain areas under the 
  effects of global climate change and this would stress coral reef ecosystems 
  and the economic activities that they support (IPCC 2001b). For example, the 
  El Niño disturbances of 1998 caused sea temperatures in the Western Indian Ocean 
  to rise by 1-1.5&deg;C, and between 50 and 90 per cent of the corals off the 
  Kenyan coast were killed through bleaching. The surviving corals had recovered 
  significantly by 1999 but damaged areas were still not re-colonized (Obura and 
  others 2000). Over 30 per cent of the coral in Djibouti was killed by bleaching 
  as a result of the same El Niño event (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 2000).</p>
<p>The negative impacts of aggravated coastal erosion include loss of investments, 
  loss of agricultural lands, loss of critical habitats, and loss of employment 
  opportunities. Governments and investors have to spend large sums on mitigating 
  processes and the potential for tourism is reduced because recreation sites 
  are lost. Cleared mangrove swamps and destroyed coral reefs also expose coastal 
  areas to inundation or contamination from seawater.</p>
<h4>Mitigation of coastal erosion in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>The Nairobi Convention covers, among other things, regulation and minimization 
  of ecological damage from dredging and land reclamation, and introduces a requirement 
  for prior assessment of environmental impacts to control and coordinate urban 
  and industrial development and the development of tourism. All countries in 
  Eastern Africa are party to the Convention and, now that the difficulties in 
  its implementation (i.e. legal and institutional arrangements), have been overcome, 
  regulation of coastal development and mitigation of erosion will be priority 
  action areas.</p>
<p>At the local level, private developers are putting up defensive structures 
  such as sea walls and groynes. However, in some cases these have actually increased 
  rather than slowed rates of erosion (Anon 1996) and mangrove and reef rehabilitation 
  projects are now recognized as more effective long-term measures.</p>
