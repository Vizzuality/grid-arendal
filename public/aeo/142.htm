<h4>Towards sustainable management and conservation of forests and woodlands in 
  Central Africa</h4>
<p>The importance of forests and forest resources in Central Africa has led stakeholders, 
  especially governments, the international community and NGOs, to intensify measures 
  for forest resource conservation and sustainable management. Countries in the 
  sub-region have engaged in re-forestation programmes in places where deforestation 
  has occurred, and in forest regeneration and rehabilitation where there has 
  been degradation. Unfortunately, data are not available to show the extent of 
  such actions. Further measures include the protection of forests through the 
  establishment of protected areas, the extent of which varies from a total of 
  27 per cent of forest and woodland area in Chad to 9 per cent in DRC (FAO 2001a). 
  Regional cooperation in protection of forests has also been strengthened in 
  recent years through the Yaounde Forest Summit and Yaounde Declaration (<a href="#box2d7">Box 
  2d.7</a>).</p>

            <p>The Yaoundé Forest Summit, held in Cameroon in March 1999, was 
              a major event in cooperation between Central African countries towards 
              tropical forest conservation. The Summit produced the Yaoundé Declaration, 
              signed by Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, DRC, 
              Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. The Declaration is a 12-point plan 
              of action for sustaining Central African forests, through commitments 
              such as the creation and extension of protected forest areas, and 
              plans to combat illegal logging and poaching. In December 2000, 
              the heads of state of these nations met again, and plans were put 
              in place to establish a transborder park, between Cameroon, Central 
              African Republic, and Congo. The Sangha park, as it will be called, 
              is the fusion of existing protected areas in the three countries, 
              and the production forests and hunting zones that surround them, 
              totalling one million hectares. This is the first park of its kind 
              in Central Africa, and will help to effect harmonisation of national 
              forest policies, policing, research, and monitoring.</p>

<p>With the exception of Chad, all of the countries of Central Africa are members 
  of the ATO and have developed criteria and indicators for sustainable forest 
  management under its auspices. Chad has developed criteria and indicators through 
  the Dry Zone Africa process. Other sub-regional initiatives include the Central 
  African Regional Environmental Programme (CARPE), a long-term initiative on 
  the part of the USAID which aims to address the issues of deforestation and 
  biodiversity loss in the Congo Basin forest zone. CARPE works with all governments 
  in the sub-region, as well as American private voluntary organizations and appropriate 
  federal agencies. Its 5-year pilot programme has been designed to gather and 
  disseminate baseline information on forest resources, and to characterize and 
  prioritize the threats to forests and opportunities for their sustainable management. 
  It also aims to strengthen the capacity of decision makers in sustainable forest 
  management.</p>
<p>Ecosystèmes Forestiers d'Afrique Centrale (ECOFAC) is another sub-regional 
  programme that seeks to reconcile development and conservation of the natural 
  environment by working closely with local communities and stakeholders. So far 
  significant work has been channelled into developing botanical inventories and 
  documenting information on forest dynamics (productivity, mortality, regeneration, 
  and phenology). These data provide a baseline for understanding of how the ecosystem 
  functions and for implementation of sustainable resource development. ECOFAC 
  has also worked extensively with indigenous groups and studied their interactions 
  with the environment, as well as pressures on the forest resources exerted by 
  various groups and activities.</p>
<p>Many countries in the region have revised their forest policies, and/ or developed 
  National Environmental Action Plans or Biodiversity Conservation Strategies. 
  However, their success is dependent on the commitment of political will, financial 
  resources, trained staff, and equipment to enforce the new regulations and protection 
  measures. Effects of these responses include an increase in the availability 
  of information on sustainable forest management, raised awareness of forest 
  issues, limited reforestation efforts, and the extension of protected areas.</p>
