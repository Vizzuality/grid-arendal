<h2>ADDRESSING HUMAN VULNERABILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE </h2>
<p>Increasing human vulnerability due to environmental change is a threat to sustainable 
  social, economic and environmental development. Governments and institutions 
  in Africa have adopted various measures in the past 30 years to deal with issues 
  which contribute to environmental change. These have ranged from political and 
  social measures to economic and environmental measures. At the political level, 
  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) spearheaded the decolonization of the 
  region, facilitating independence to many countries and, in so doing, making 
  natural resources more accessible to millions of people. For example, the elimination 
  of apartheid in South Africa in 1994 helped to reduce the marginalization of 
  most of the people to the abundant resources in their own country. As a result 
  of apartheid, the white farmers, who make up only 5 per cent of the population, 
  own 87 per cent of the land (Moyo 2000). The mean amount of land held per person 
  in South Africa is slightly more than 1 ha for blacks and 1 570 ha for whites 
  (SADC Regional Human Development Report 2000). This situation has to change 
  if sustainability is to be achieved. The South African government is committed 
  to buying land and resettling the landless.</p>
<p>Other measures have been adopted to enhance sustainable development and to 
  help to reduce the vulnerability of the population, including: investment in 
  human resources; trade liberalization; review of outdated laws; and strengthening 
  institutions at different levels. Such measures have been supported at national, 
  sub-regional, regional and global levels. In terms of environmental management, 
  together with other regions, African countries have adopted <i>Agenda 21</i>-the 
  blueprint for sustainable development-and various multilateral environmental 
  agreements (MEAs). <a href="#box315">Box 3.15</a> outlines some <i>Agenda 21 
  </i>principles which are relevant to human vulnerability.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Principle 6:The special situation and needs of developing countries, 
                particularly the least developed and those most environmentally 
                vulnerable, shall be given special priority. International actions 
                in the field of environment and development should also address 
                the interests and needs of all countries. </li>
              <li>Principle 8:To achieve sustainable development and a higher 
                quality of life for all people, states should reduce and eliminate 
                unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and promote 
                appropriate demographic policies. </li>
              <li>Principle 15: In order to protect the environment, the precautionary 
                approach shall be widely applied by States according to their 
                capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible 
                damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as 
                a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental 
                degradation. </li>
              <li>Principle 18: States shall immediately notify other States of 
                any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely to 
                produce sudden harmful effects on the environment of those States. 
                Every effort shall be made by the international community to help 
                States so afflicted.</li>

<p>The latest initiative adopted by African leaders in 2001 is the New Partnership 
  for Africa's Development (NEPAD), whose long-term objective is to 'eradicate 
  poverty ... and to place African countries, both individually and collectively, 
  on a path of sustainable growth and development and thus halt the marginalization 
  of Africa in the globalization process.' Under NEPAD, African political leaders 
  have pledged to work both individually and collectively for peace, security, 
  democracy, good governance, human rights and sound economic management, all 
  of which are the conditions for sustainable development.</p>
<p>The African leaders also recognize that the range of issues necessary to nurture 
  the region's environmental base is vast and complex. They emphasized the need 
  for 'a systematic combination of initiatives to develop a coherent environmental 
  programme ... It is also recognized that a core objective of the (NEPAD) environment 
  initiative must be to help in combating poverty and contributing to socio-economic 
  development in Africa. It has been demonstrated in other parts of the world 
  that measures taken to achieve a healthy environmental base can contribute greatly 
  to employment, social and economic empowerment, and reduction of poverty' (NEPAD 
  2001).</p>
<p>NEPAD targets a number of areas for action. These include: combating desertification; 
  wetland conservation; global warming; environmental governance; and financing.</p>
