<h3>LAND RIGHTS </h3>
<p>The issue of land rights in Africa is a highly complex and sensitive social 
  and political issue, closely linked with poverty and land degradation issues. 
  The following terminology is applied throughout this review to avoid ambiguity 
  or confusion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'land rights' include rights over access to land and resources;</li>
  <li>'land tenure' refers to the conditions and institutional arrangements under 
    which land is held;</li>
  <li>'land reform' encompasses reform of land rights and policies, as well as 
    land redistribution or the physical reallocation of land; and</li>
  <li>'land restitution' refers to the restoration of land to indigenous people, 
    following alienation under colonialism or apartheid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional land tenure systems in Africa were developed in accordance with 
  variations in physical conditions and cultures, although they were largely centred 
  on communal access to resources and sharing of benefits. Tenure was rarely recorded 
  or registered, and land rights were largely allocated through inheritance or 
  other regulatory and distributive mechanisms. Traditional systems offer more 
  security of tenure than is often recognized by supporters of individual tenure 
  systems, although women generally have lower status than men (Cleaver and Schreiber 
  1994). The insecurity of women in this regard is illustrated in <a href="#box2f2">Box 
  2f.2</a>. In pastoral communities, land may be under tenure or may be open access. 
  Here, access is regulated according to seasonal abundance of resources, and 
  is determined by traditional governance systems. The mobility of pastoral communities 
  buffers against climatic variability and provides them with greater food security.</p>

            <p>In most parts of Africa, both modern and traditional laws favour 
              patriarchal ownership of land and control of resources.Women may 
              be granted access to resources through their fathers or husbands 
              on a temporary basis but, if they become widowed, they may be forced 
              to leave their land. There is also a financial bias towards male 
              ownership, as women tend to have lower incomes than men and, therefore, 
              may not be able to afford to purchase land, or to acquire access 
              to credit schemes.Women are also discriminated against in the quality 
              of land they have access to, and often have marginal and remote 
              land.</p>
            <p>However, with land reform efforts progressing in many African countries, 
              access to land, ownership and registration systems are helping to 
              shift the balance of equity in recognition of the rights of vulnerable 
              groups, including women and minority, ethnic or nomadic groups.</p>

<p>However, colonial regimes and newly independent governments perceived traditional 
  tenure and access systems to be insecure and poorly suited to commercial, settled 
  agricultural development and conventional economic growth (Cleaver and Schreiber 
  1994, Toulmin and Longbottom 1997). Thus, land largely became the property of 
  the state, and was then redistributed with discrimination along lines of wealth, 
  race or gender (Cleaver and Schreiber 1994). Resulting conflicts between traditional 
  and contemporary tenure and access policies have frequently led to the mismanagement 
  of resources and to conflicts between user groups. In the Western Indian Ocean 
  state of Comoros, for example, there are three types of land tenure system in 
  place: traditional, colonial and Islamic (RFIC 1998). The best land is reserved 
  for commercial crops which are mainly for export, whilst small-scale and subsistence 
  farmers are left with less productive, even marginal areas, such as steep slopes. 
  Without proper terracing, these areas are prone to soil erosion (COMESA 2001). 
  Extreme inequity in land distribution is seen in South Africa, where access 
  to land averages just over 1 ha/capita for black farmers and 1 570 ha/capita 
  for white farmers (SARIPS 2000). A further complication affecting access rights 
  and food security across Africa is that of population growth, resulting in greater 
  and greater land fragmentation under the traditional system of inheritance and 
  sub-division. As each successive generation inherits a smaller and smaller parcel 
  of land, average farm size per household is declining, thus contributing to 
  food insecurity.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, governments have realized that centralized management 
  of land resources is also inappropriate, and processes of land reform are underway 
  in many countries. Individual land titling may be appropriate, for example, 
  in urban areas but, in pastoral areas, communal ownership may be a more viable 
  alternative. Legal recognition of traditional landuse practices could be a means 
  of avoiding the overexploitation of resources associated with lack of ownership 
  and accrual of benefits (the 'tragedy of the commons'). Mozambique is one of 
  the countries where demarcation of community lands is being undertaken and, 
  in Tanzania, the Village Land Act provides for collective land ownership for 
  pastoralists (DFID 1999). Protection of sacred forests through community ownership 
  and management is also emerging as a successful model of forest conservation 
  (Alden Wiley 2000). Uganda's 1998 Land Act attempts to integrate traditional 
  and contemporary tenure and access policies, allowing: legal registration of 
  traditional land rights; representation of traditional authorities in dispute 
  resolution; and the formation of communal land associations. However, there 
  is still confusion among the public over their rights, and implementation has 
  been restricted through lack of resources (DFID 1999).</p>

<p>Another key element in the discussion of land reform processes is the effect 
  of different tenure systems on investment in resource management and on productivity. 
  Evidence of subsistence level production being less efficient is still inconclusive, 
  and comparisons are complicated by existing market failures and by inequities 
  in market access. The role of the private sector needs to be explored further, 
  and a clear strategy of land use and production needs to be developed and understood 
  by all participants before implementation. Otherwise, there is a risk of collapse 
  in production during a transition period (DFID 1999).</p>
<p>Other issues for concern and for continued discussion include: the means for 
  developing effective, legitimate institutions for the management of land rights; 
  the implementation of market-based instruments for the redistribution of land; 
  the question of land restitution; and the continuing marginalization of women, 
  indigenous peoples, and pastoralists or huntergatherers (DFID 1999). The role 
  of the state in facilitating or administrating land reform is also under the 
  spotlight, particularly in Zimbabwe, where the land issue has become the central 
  campaign issue between political parties (Moyo 2002).</p>
<p>Delays in reform have been considerable, and governments continue to hold legally 
  defined de jure ownership rights over much of rural Africa. By contrast, and 
  often as a consequence, rural communities and individuals exert de facto rights 
  to land and resources, based on claims to traditional land rights, and in protestation 
  over slow reforms (Cousins 2000). In some countries, most notably, southern 
  African countries, where there was extreme inequity in access to and ownership 
  of land and resources, the process of reform has been catalysed by demonstrative 
  and, in some cases, violent action. In Zimbabwe, for example, there have been 
  several violent clashes over illegal land occupation (for example, Drimie and 
  Mbaya 2001).</p>
<p>Land reform is a highly contested and sensitive issue, requiring an appropriately 
  sensitive approach. Policies must consider country-specific situations and objectives, 
  within an overall development context. Policies will necessarily be developed 
  through several iterations, with the involvement of all stakeholders, particularly 
  those most marginalized (Drimie and Mbaya 2001).</p>
<p>The following sections give further details of specific issues and policies 
  relating to land resources in each of the African sub-regions. </p>
