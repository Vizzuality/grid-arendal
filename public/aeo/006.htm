<h1 class="prelims">SYNTHESIS</h1>
<p>The <i>Africa Environment Outlook </i>(AEO) report provides a comprehensive 
  and integrated analysis of Africa's environment. AEO contains a detailed assessment 
  of the current state of the environment in the region, indicates discernible 
  environmental trends and examines the complex interplay between natural events 
  and the impacts of human actions on the environment. Against this background, 
  the report analyses the effects of environmental change in terms of human vulnerability 
  and security, presents a set of scenarios for Africa's future and gives recommendations 
  for concrete policy actions to steer the region, ultimately, towards the most 
  favourable of those scenarios.</p>
<h3>ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>1972-2002 The historical focus of AEO is the 30-year period since the United 
  Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1972. 
  However, much of the degradation of Africa's environment today is part of a 
  legacy from less favourable times, including the periods of the slave trade 
  and colonialism. The historical scope of AEO therefore widens to discuss that 
  legacy, and to show how the march of history has often overshadowed traditional 
  African ways of life and knowledge that were inherently more respectful of the 
  environment than some modern forms of development.</p>
<p>The 'winds of change' that began to blow across Africa in the early 1960s and 
  the gathering momentum of African countries' struggle for independence are also 
  described. An understanding of this process is vital to appreciate the emergence 
  of a common African will to address the problems of environmental change and 
  sustainable development.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, it was largely as a result of the 1972 Stockholm Conference that 
  environmental concerns moved centre stage in the social and political debate 
  in most parts of the world, and its conclusions helped to set the modern environmental 
  agenda in Africa as elsewhere. But the conclusions of the Stockholm Conference 
  have, perhaps, special significance for Africa. First because they state firmly 
  that a healthy environment is not only a fundamental right but that it is one 
  that cannot be attained while apartheid, racial segregation or colonial domination 
  persist, and second because they call for the earth's resources to be protected 
  for the benefit of present and future generations. Such a call had immediate 
  relevance for a region that was throwing off colonial ties and where many people 
  are poor and therefore rely directly on natural resources for their livelihood. 
  AEO traces the efforts made by African organizations, governments and institutions 
  throughout the focus period to meet the challenge of that call, to translate 
  a common will into careful, planned and appropriate management of Africa's huge 
  wealth of natural resources, and to set the region on a course for sustainable 
  development.</p>
<h3>STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>1972-2002 The causes of environmental change up to 2002 are examined, including 
  those relating to policy and governance. The impacts of environmental change 
  on the functioning of ecosystems and on social and economic development are 
  also considered, in seven major areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b>Atmosphere: 
  </b>Africa is extremely vulnerable to climate variability and climate change. 
  Variations in rainfall patterns have led to incidences of drought and flooding, 
  often with disastrous consequences for populations and for the environment. 
  The predicted consequences of global climate change-worsening impacts of drought, 
  desertification, flooding, and sea level rise-may well worsen the situation 
  of Africa's people, even though the region's greenhouse gas emissions are, on 
  the whole, negligible. Analysis of the consequences of activities such as deforestation, 
  inappropriate coastal development, and poor land management shows that these 
  can exacerbate the effects of climate variability and climate change. Air quality 
  is an emerging issue of concern in many parts of Africa, especially in expanding 
  urban areas where concentrations of population, industry and vehicles are increasing 
  air pollution.</p>
<p><b><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b>Biodiversity: 
  </b>Africa's biological resources are declining rapidly as a result of habitat 
  loss, overharvesting of selected resources, and illegal activities. Formal protection 
  has been strengthened at the national and international level over the past 
  30 years. However, additional measures are required including additional research 
  and documentation, particularly of indigenous knowledge, implementation of strategies 
  for sustainable harvesting and trade, wider involvement of stakeholders, and 
  more equitable sharing of benefits.</p>
<p><b><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b>Coastal 
  and marine habitats: </b>Coastal and marine habitats and resources in Africa 
  are under threat from pollution, overharvesting of resources, inappropriate 
  development in the coastal zone, and poor inland landmanagement. Oil pollution 
  is a major threat to resources, habitats, and economies along the African coastline. 
  Policies and regulations for sustainable coastal development and use of marine 
  resources are in place but require sustained resources such as trained personnel, 
  equipment, financial resources, and more effective policing, monitoring, administration 
  and enforcement.</p>
<p><b><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b>Forests: 
  </b>Africa has the fastest rate of deforestation anywhere in the world. In addition 
  to its ecological impacts, deforestation also means definitive loss of vital 
  resources causing communities to lose their livelihoods and vital energy sources. 
  Political commitment to protection of indigenous forests, sustainable harvesting 
  practices, and community ownership require strengthening. Development of alternative 
  energy sources is also a priority.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b><b>Freshwater: 
  </b>Lack of availability and low quality of freshwater are the two most limiting 
  factors for development in Africa, constraining food production and industrial 
  activities, and contributing significantly to the burden of disease.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b><b>Land: 
  </b>Degradation of soil and of vegetation resources is largely a result of increasing 
  population pressures, inequitable land access and tenure policies, poor land 
  management, and widespread poverty. The results are declining agricultural yields, 
  affecting economies and food security; desertification of arid areas, raising 
  competition for remaining resources; and increased potential for conflict. Land 
  tenure reform, international cooperation, and integration of land resource management 
  with development goals are required.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet.gif" width="9" height="8" vspace="1"> <b></b><b>Urbanization: 
  </b>Although most Africans currently live in rural areas, the region's rates 
  of urbanization are among the highest in the world. Poor economic growth and 
  low investment in infrastructure have left provision of housing and basic services 
  in urban areas lagging far behind rates of inward migration, resulting in a 
  proliferation of informal settlements in urban Africa.</p>
