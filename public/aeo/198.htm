<h3>EXTENT AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CULTIVATION AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN 
  WESTERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Total land area under crop cultivation in the sub-region has grown from 51 
  million ha in 1970 to 66 million ha in 2000 (FAOSTAT 2001). Absolute crop production 
  has also increased, whereas per capita production was the same in 2000 as it 
  was in 1970, having declined until 1985, and then recovered, as shown in <a href="#fig2f16">Figure 
  2f.16</a>. Livestock production has also increased in absolute terms, although 
  per capita production increased between 1975 and 1985, and then declined to 
  below 1970 levels (see <a href="#fig2f17">Figure 2f.17</a>).</p>
<p>Whilst there has been an overall increase in the daily per capita calorie supply 
  in western Africa (from an average of 2 252 calories/capita/day in 1970 to 2 
  612 calories/capita/day in 1999), Liberia and Sierra Leone have seen declines 
  (FAOSTAT 2001). This is probably due to supply and distribution disruptions, 
  as a result of the civil wars in these countries. Conflicts and climatic variability 
  have also been the cause of western African countries being food-deficit countries, 
  and among the most food insecure in the world (Staatz, Diskin and Estes 1999). 
  These countries have been dependent on food imports and aid, and are likely 
  to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. For example, Sierra Leone was 
  a net exporter of rice in the 1960s but, by 2001, was importing it at an approximate 
  cost of US$22 million a year (Verheye 2001). The food situation in 2001 was 
  also particularly severe in Burkina Faso, Liberia and Niger, where the FAO was 
  warning of the need for food aid (FAO 2001d).</p>
<p>Efforts to improve food security have been instigated at the sub-regional and 
  national levels. For example, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) 
  is currently developing a Western Africa Strategy, in order to determine priority 
  needs and areas of assistance (Staatz and others 1999). A further subregional 
  response has come from the CILSS and the Club du Sahel. The Club du Sahel is 
  a donor group of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
  which interfaces with CILSS. It was established after the 1972-73 drought, in 
  order to ensure that the disaster was not repeated. Together, these institutions 
  developed a Charter for Food Aid to the Sahel in 1990. The charter, the first 
  of its kind, provided guidelines for improving food aid practices, and integrating 
  foreign assistance into long-term food security objectives. The three main focus 
  areas are: enhancing understanding of the food situation; coordination of donations; 
  and provision of food aid (OECD/ Club du Sahel 2001). Mali and Niger have established 
  wellfunctioning early warning systems (EWS), whereas other countries are experiencing 
  start-up problems. Lack of coordination between donors, and confusion over requests 
  for aid, have also been experienced in some countries (OECD/ Club du Sahel 2001).</p>
