<p>Natural habitats in Africa are being degraded or lost owing to a number of 
  'proximate' and 'ultimate' (or root) causes. Proximate causes include clearing 
  for alternative land uses (mainly agriculture and human settlements) and overharvesting 
  of resources (most notably timber in the forests of Central and Western Africa). 
  Over 211 million hectares of African forest have been lost since 1970, amounting 
  to almost 30 per cent of the original extent. In the same period, the land area 
  under cultivation has increased by 36 million hectares, or 21 per cent (FAOSTAT 
  2000). Other threats to terrestrial habitats include bush fires which are commonly 
  used in agriculture to prepare the soil but which can get out of control and 
  destroy large areas of forest or woodland. On the other hand, fire (along with 
  grazing) is also considered to be one of the most important factors determining 
  the structure of savanna ecosystems (Gichohi, Gakahu & Mwangi 1996).</p>
<p>Coastal habitats are being reduced by proximate causes such as overharvesting 
  of resources, physical alterations and urban and industrial developments, siltation, 
  pollution, introduction of alien species, and global climate change (Martens 
  1995). Inland wetland areas have suffered in the same way, with additional problems 
  stemming from drainage for conversion to agriculture and salinization of soils 
  due to irrigation, as well as overextraction of water from lakes or the rivers 
  feeding them (Harper & Mavuti 1996).</p>
<p>The ultimate causes of habitat loss in Africa are human population growth and 
  the resulting demand for space, food and other resources; widespread poverty; 
  a dependence on natural resources; and economic pressures to increase exports, 
  particularly of agricultural produce, timber and mineral products. A lack of 
  awareness of the value of wild biological resources, lack of knowledge of biodiversity 
  and of how to apply that knowledge, and failure to enforce conservation policies 
  have also contributed to a decline in area of natural habitat. For example, 
  development and expansion of settlements, infrastructure and logging activities 
  have not, until recently, been coordinated with respect to natural habitat or 
  sensitive ecosystems and were not subject to environmental impact assessment 
  requirements. In some cases, protected areas have been established without consultation 
  of local people, without their consent and, frequently, without being based 
  on rigorous biological inventory studies. This has led to protected areas which 
  are not only less effective in their contribution to conservation but which 
  have also failed to earn the respect of local communities. In some cases, communities 
  have encroached on the protected areas, in others they have deliberately raided 
  resources (FAO 1995, Fay, Palmer, & Timmermans 2000). Weak legal and institutional 
  structures, corruption, conflict and civil strife, as well as market factors, 
  can also contribute indirectly (or even directly) to habitat degradation and 
  loss (Martens 1995, Rodgers, Salehe & Olsen 2000).</p>
<p>Loss of habitat threatens biodiversity at all levels, from the 'ecosystem' 
  to the 'genetic'. Three main processes are at work, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reduction in the total size of habitat;</li>
  <li>fragmentation of habitat; and</li>
  <li>change in the structure or characteristics of the habitat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plant and animal communities need habitats that are of sufficient size to provide 
  food and water and to find a mate or nesting site. If the total size of a habitat 
  is reduced, the sizes of the populations of many species, particularly large 
  mammals and top predators, are forced to decline. In some cases, population 
  sizes have reached the minimum viable population, that is to say the lower limits 
  beyond which the species will not be able to breed successfully (Gilpin & Soule 
  1986).</p>
<p>Fragmentation of habitats is a particular problem for large animals and top 
  predators which require extensive ranges. Even if the total area of a natural 
  habitat is large, some species may still be threatened if it is divided into 
  fragments that are too small or are lacking in some vital components (Harris 
  1984, Gilpin & Soule 1986, Skole & Tucker 1993). This factor has not always 
  been taken into account when creating protected areas, and migration routes 
  of large herbivores have been cut off, preventing them from finding adequate 
  food or water resources in times of stress.</p>
<p>Fragmentation and selective harvesting can also change the nature of a habitat, 
  making it unsuitable for certain species. Forests, for example, have distinct 
  'edge species' and 'interior species'. Edge species are those that are suited 
  to conditions at the edge of the forest (where there is typically more exposure 
  to light, wind, and predation), interior species are more suited to conditions 
  inside the forest. Reduction of forest area or size of forest patches increases 
  the ratio of edge to interior, and thus changes the species composition (Lovejoy, 
  Bierregaard, Rylands, Malcolm, Quintela, Harper, Brown, Powell, Powell, Schubart 
  & Hays 1986). Too much edge threatens interior species and natural forest dynamics 
  can collapse.</p>
