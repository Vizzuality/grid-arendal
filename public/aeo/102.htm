<h3>POLLUTION OF NORTHERN AFRICA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT </h3>

<p>The Mediterranean and Red Seas are particularly sensitive to pollution because 
  they are semi-enclosed basins with straits leading to the Atlantic and Indian 
  Oceans respectively, and through which replacement of seawater is slow. They 
  also have high evaporation rates and relatively low run-off from the arid lands 
  surrounding them. Exchanges of freshwater and seawater are therefore low in 
  these basins and dilution is limited, meaning that pollution entering the basins 
  is likely to become concentrated over time.</p>
<p>In the Red Sea, there is a high risk of marinebased pollution including phosphate 
  poisoning, industrial pollutants, sewage, solid waste and other contaminants 
  related to tourism activities, dumping of general and hazardous wastes from 
  ships, and leaks and spills of oil. Over 100 million tonnes of oil are transported 
  through the Red Sea annually and both regulation of maritime traffic and maintenance 
  of navigational aids are inadequate (World Bank 1996a). As a result, there have 
  been over 20 oil spills along the Egyptian Red Sea coast since 1982 (Pilcher 
  & Alsuhaibany 2000). Offshore oil leaks and spills from the oil industry are 
  another threat to human and coastal and marine resources in the Northern Red 
  Sea, and Suez Gulf area.</p>
<p>An emerging issue of concern is the increasing presence of Red Sea fish and 
  algal species in the Mediterranean basin, transported via ballast water of cargo 
  ships passing through the Suez Canal (FAO 1997). Introduction of such alien 
  species could potentially disturb the balance of species in the Mediterranean 
  ecosystem.</p>
<p>Domestic and agricultural wastes contribute to pollution in Northern Africa's 
  coastal zone, with sewage being the major cause for concern, followed by persistent 
  organic pollutants (POPs) from pesticide residues, then heavy metals and oils, 
  predominantly from industrial effluents. Sewage discharge and agricultural run-off 
  into coastal waters are causing eutrophication and algal blooms have been reported 
  on the coral reefs of the Sudanese coast (Pilcher & Alsuhaibany 2000).</p>
<p>Egypt has a flourishing tourism industry with sites such as Hurghada and Sharm 
  el Sheikh well developed and expanding rapidly. However, some reports suggest 
  that these and other resorts, such as the Ras Mohammad National Park, are experiencing 
  pollution and reef degradation caused by levels of tourism and infrastructure 
  that are too intensive for these sensitive habitats (UNEP 1997). </p>
