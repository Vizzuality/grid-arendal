  Africa </i></p>
<p>With stagnant to declining economic growth, Africa remains essentially a subsistence 
  economy. Land resources, however, have been subjected to increasing pressure, 
  as a result of population increase and climate change. There is declining productivity 
  in grazing and agricultural lands, due to a combination of: inequitable land 
  distribution; poor farming methods and unfavourable land tenure; ownership systems; 
  and inefficient irrigation systems. The rapidly increasing populations of humans 
  and animals translate into overexploitation of water, land, forest and pasture 
  resources, through overcultivation, overgrazing, deforestation and poor irrigation 
  practices.</p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, indigenous African farming systems and cultivation 
  techniques -adapted to local ecological conditions and sensitive to the preservation 
  of fragile natural resources-collapse, except in pockets here and there. Meanwhile, 
  agriculture practices that are not adapted to the fragile African soils significantly 
  degrade the land and reduce its productivity. The rapid impoverishment of rural 
  traditional systems results in the abandonment of relatively benign methods 
  of exploitation of nature, and in their replacement with aggressive methods, 
  which assume that natural resources are limitless. With stringent economic conditions, 
  and denied access to land, poor peasants cultivate marginal land, leading to 
  declining productivity. Resilience to environmental and social changes deteriorates 
  outside of the fortresses, contrary to the situation inside the enclaves.</p>
<p>The pressure on land, vegetation and water supplies has made Africa increasingly 
  prone to food security crises. Dramatic increases in populations, combined with 
  increased land degradation, has resulted in the decline of per capita food production. 
  Annual population growth has exceeded increases in food production, creating 
  a chronic food crisis for the poor, and widening the food gap. In the bubbles 
  of élite, the situation is the reverse. Food production exceeds the needs of 
  the small élite population. In the Fortress World scenario, a positive survival 
  practice of urban poor is the increasing practice of urban agriculture-the production 
  of food and non-food crops, and animal husbandry, in built-up areas. However, 
  most urban agriculture remains largely unrecognized and unassisted, if not outlawed 
  or harassed.</p>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, environmental refugees and conflict-displaced 
  people migrate to areas of greater food availability-mainly where they can receive 
  food aid. However, with emergency aid decreasing, it becomes inevitable for 
  rural people to migrate to towns or cities, considerably swelling the numbers 
  of the urban poor. In general, the élite become the class of resource-extractors, 
  driven by the global market economy, and impoverishing both the environment 
  and subsistence resources for rural people.</p>
<p>The chaos and weakness of systems of governance precipitate insecure land tenure 
  as the norm for those outside the fortress, thus providing no incentive for 
  sustainable land management. In contrast, the élite secure land tenure for their 
  land. Thus, their land is preserved and properly managed, using modern and enhanced 
  agriculture systems.</p>
