<h4>Management of pollution and waste in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>The volume of solid wastes generated by urban centres in Eastern Africa has 
  been increasing, mainly as a result of growing urban population, concentration 
  of industries in the urban areas, consumption patterns of residents, and inadequate 
  finances and facilities to manage waste collection and disposal. There is thus 
  a wide variation in solid waste generation. Recent data were not available for 
  all cities in the sub-region but, in 1993, solid waste generation ranged from 
  6 kg/capita/day in Kampala to 1.4 kg/capita/day in Bujumbura and 0.6 kg/capita/day 
  in Kigali (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNDP, UNEP & World Bank 1998). Percentages of 
  households benefiting from garbage collection services also varied, from 47 
  per cent in Nairobi to 20 per cent in Kampala, and just 2 per cent in Addis 
  Ababa (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNDP, UNEP & World Bank 1998).</p>
<p>Proper collection and disposal of solid waste is necessary in order to avoid 
  environmental pollution problems such as pollution of surface water bodies and 
  of the ambient atmosphere, through burning or decomposition. In Kenya, an increasing 
  amount of plastic materials has been observed among solid wastes. This is a 
  problem, as plastics block the drainage systems leading to frequent flooding 
  in urban areas. In Bujumbura, 33 per cent of solid wastes are deposited in open 
  dumps, 27 per cent is burned openly, and only 15 per cent finds its way to sanitary 
  landfill (UNCHS 2001c). A similar pattern is observed in Addis Ababa where 10 
  per cent is deposited in sanitary landfill, 21 per cent is dumped openly, and 
  the remainder is unaccounted for (UNCHS 2001c). In Kigali a staggering 84 per 
  cent of solid waste is burned openly, giving rise to unpleasant and sometimes 
  toxic fumes (UNCHS 2001c). On the outskirts of Kampala, large volumes of wastes 
  are dumped at Lweza and Lubigi, which were originally wetlands, and Uganda's 
  only recognized landfill, at Mpererwe, is actually managed as a dumpsite rather 
  than as a designated sanitary landfill (Ngategize and others 2000).</p>
<p>Policy failures in the past have contributed to poor waste collection and management 
  because most urban authorities would not allow private sector involvement in 
  waste management. There are also inadequate facilities for recycling materials 
  such as paper, aluminium, and glass, and inadequate measures in the re-use of 
  recycled containers that may have contained harmful substances. Moreover, there 
  is an overall lack of awareness and limited community participation in the management 
  of solid wastes (Ngategize and others 2000). In response to this, the government 
  of Uganda enacted the Environment Statute (1995) and regulations (1999) to address 
  solid waste management. However, there is still no national waste management 
  policy in Uganda, although a draft action plan for municipal solid waste management 
  was developed in 1999 (NEMA 2001). The City of Kampala privatized its solid 
  waste management functions recently and, in June 2000, eleven companies were 
  operating and their contribution to waste management was increasing steadily 
  (Ngategize and others 2000). Nairobi City Council opted to privatize its solid 
  waste management in 1997 when it was recognized that solid waste generation 
  was outstripping capacity to collect and treat the waste (UNCHS 1998). By 1998 
  improvements to waste management had been noted, although some areas were still 
  inadequately serviced or unserviced (UNCHS 1998).</p>
<p>Long-term data on levels of air pollution in urban centres in Eastern Africa 
  are not available. However, emissions from vehicles, industries, and domestic 
  consumption of coal, wood, charcoal, and other fuels cause localized smog and 
  pose risks to human health. Additional sources of air pollutants include waste 
  dumps which emit methane, sulphur oxides, and carbon dioxide. There are growing 
  numbers of motorized vehicles in the major urban centres, and many of the vehicles 
  on the roads are old and inefficient (MoWTC 2000). In addition, leaded petrol 
  is still widely used and traffic congestion is a common occurrence because transport 
  networks have not been upgraded to keep pace with the increasing numbers of 
  vehicles (NEMA 2001). Vehicular emissions account for 95 per cent of atmospheric 
  lead concentrations in Kampala, and residents of urban areas have higher levels 
  of lead in their blood than those exposed to less traffic (NEMA 2001). Air quality 
  standards for all major pollutants have been established for most countries 
  in Eastern Africa, but lack of resources renders enforcement below optimum levels.</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Entebbe, Gulu, Iganga, Jinja, Kampala, Masindi District, and Njeru in Uganda, 
  and Nakuru and Thika in Kenya, are members of the African Sustainable Cities 
  Network, and have been working towards capacity building for improved environmental 
  planning and management, and implementation of sustainable urban development 
  strategies in partnership with stakeholder groups.</p>
<p>Jinja, Uganda, is a highly industrialized and agricultural centre on the shores 
  of Lake Victoria. As a result of these developments, and the attraction of the 
  source of the Nile, Jinja has experienced rapid population growth, with consequent 
  pressure on the environment. Inadequate housing, waste collection and disposal 
  and electricity supply result in pollution of air, water and soil, excessive 
  vegetation removal, and eutrophication and siltation of waterways. The local 
  environmental action plan, developed through the ASCN programme, has encouraged 
  greater public participation in local issues and programmes. Through the system 
  of decentralization, considerable power and decision making has been devolved 
  to local communities, who now have the right to be involved in planning and 
  managing their own affairs (ICLEI 2001).</p>
<p>The town of Nakuru in Kenya has developed a Local Agenda 21 framework to build 
  a long-term vision in partnership with stakeholders, and to combine urban development 
  with sustainable environmental practice. Nakuru is situated between two environmentally 
  sensitive areas, the Menengai crater and Lake Nakuru National Park and is a 
  rapidly growing town with growth based on based on agricultural development 
  and services, tourism, and administration. There are also plans to strengthen 
  the functions of the Municipal Council and to stimulate innovative partnerships. 
  Plans are to be implemented on the basis of partnerships between local communities 
  and the municipality (ICLEI 2001).</p>
<p>In Addis Ababa, a programme is underway to build capacity in urban planning 
  and management and to reduce urban poverty. The programme is jointly implemented 
  by the Ethiopian Ministry of Works and Urban Development, Addis Ababa City authorities, 
  Ethiopian Civil Service College, UNDP, and UNCHS. The objective is to develop 
  an urban development strategy and operational guidelines for municipalities, 
  focusing on urban management, housing development, integrated infrastructure 
  development, municipal finance management and upgrading of institutional capacity 
  (UNCHS/ROAAS 2001).</p>
