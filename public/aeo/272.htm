<h4>Governance</h4>
<p>It is impossible to achieve economic development without good governance. Since 
  independence, African countries have been subjected to various forms of government, 
  including: communism and socialism in Tanzania and Ghana; various forms of democracy 
  in Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya and Nigeria; and quasi-military rule in many other countries. 
  Chazan and others (1992) provided a six-fold classification, with the following 
  categories of governance: administrative hegemonic; pluralist; party mobilizing; 
  party centralist; personal coercive; and populist. <a href="#tab41">Table 4.1</a> 
  indicates the countries which fell into these groups. The 1960s, 1970s and early 
  1980s were periods of serious unrest in many African countries, and times when 
  the role of governance was seriously called into question. The near-total breakdown 
  of services, the increasing pauperization of the people, and the complete breakdown 
  of law and order in some countries are continuing evidence of this unrest.</p>

<p>Post-colonial changes in government were achieved through military interventions 
  and through various forms of elections, many of which were merely symbolic and 
  not designed to effect serious changes in the structure of governance. Thus, 
  some involved competitions for office within a single party, while others involved 
  limited multi-party participation. Only in very rare cases were elections designed 
  to provide a mechanism for the simultaneous turnover of both leaders and regime.</p>
<p>Military interventions in governance led to various forms of instability, and 
  to the rise of insurgencies, riots, and ethnic rife and rivalries. Military 
  expenditures increased, and accounted for significant per centages of the GDP 
  of these countries (UNIDIR 1991). The lack of focus in governance led to a breakdown 
  of many government institutions and to wasteful duplication of efforts in the 
  development process.</p>
<p>The international community intervened in many ways, including attempts to 
  sanitize national economies through suggestions and recommendations by the IMF 
  and the WB. There was also the influence of multinational and transnational 
  companies, some of which are financially stronger than many African national 
  economies. The effects of these organizations were so pervading that, in some 
  countries, they seemed to run parallel governments. There is no doubt today 
  that African economies need some streamlining or restructuring. What most people 
  do not agree about is not if and when this will be done, but how and by whom 
  it will be done.</p>
<p>Good governance in Africa is challenged by various issues, including the collapse 
  of the state in countries where governance has already been weakened by strife, 
  and where governments hardly have the capacity to govern and to maintain law 
  and order. In spite of the fact that African leaders have adopted democracy 
  as a key element of their agendas over the past decade, the democratic process 
  remains challenged. Narrow political considerations, personalized power and 
  corruption have undermined the process of democracy and responsive governance. 
  Inequity in social, economic and political systems, including gender inequity, 
  has been a barrier to achieving good governance. This has resulted in notably 
  increasing disparities between rich and poor in terms of income and capabilities, 
  and in the marginalizing of women in governance.</p>
<p>Poverty remains widely spread in Africa. As such, poverty alleviation represents 
  the greatest challenge to good governance. There is also the challenge of how 
  to manage effectively financial and natural resources, promoting decentralization 
  based on trust, transparency, accountability and capacity.</p>
<p>Corruption and the theft of public funds are some of the problems which have 
  blighted the region's governance record. Many Africans wonder how much of their 
  stolen funds, hidden somewhere in western banks, could make a difference in 
  terms of debt repayments and financing the region's renaissance. But, for the 
  second time, the winds of change blew across the region, as the majority of 
  people demanded greater accountability from their elected leaders. They called 
  for transparency and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Institutional reforms emerge as people begin to develop new forms of social 
  consciousness and as they move to prevent the violation of human rights. When 
  this happens, civil societies emerge in large numbers, and their influence increases 
  and serves as a check on the excesses of national governments. Local participation 
  in decision making also increases considerably. Efforts are made to reduce conflict-in 
  countries where conflicts presently exist-by assisting with the provision of 
  basic services and by breaking the poverty trap.</p>
