<h2><a name="img2c5"></a>WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h2>
<p>Small oceanic islands, such as those in the Western Indian Ocean, experience 
  problems in controlling and regulating activities in their relatively extensive 
  EEZ, making them vulnerable to overexploitation of their marine resources, particularly 
  deep-water fisheries. In addition, land- and marine-based sources of pollution, 
  associated with rapidly growing coastal populations, development of tourism 
  and oil transportation by sea, are a further cause for concern over the state 
  of the coastal and marine environments.</p>
<p>The Western Indian Ocean Islands are also experiencing accelerated rates of 
  coastal erosion resulting from poor coastal planning and development, exacerbating 
  their vulnerability to climate-changerelated sea level rise which threatens 
  to inundate large areas of land and displace large populations. Sea temperature 
  rises in the Western Indian Ocean, also associated with global climate change, 
  may cause bleaching of the exceptionally biologically rich and economically 
  important coral reefs.</p>
<h3>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS IN 
  THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>The oceanic islands of Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles have 
  evolved in isolation from continental Africa, and were colonized by humans only 
  relatively recently. They are therefore unique in their physical characteristics 
  and in terms of the biological communities they support. The fringing coral 
  reefs and the reefs surrounding the islands include the Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles), 
  one of the most spectacular reefs in the world and a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>All the islands support well-developed tourism industries which are important 
  sources of income and foreign exchange. Coastal tourism is, for example, the 
  mainstay of the economy in Seychelles, contributing 46-55 per cent of GDP, 70 
  per cent of foreign income, and employing 20 per cent of the population (International 
  Ocean Institute 2001).</p>
<p>There are also extensive seagrass beds, mangroves, diverse fisheries and seafood 
  species, and lagoons. These resources mainly support artisanal fishermen (about 
  90 per cent of all fish landings are from smallscale operators (International 
  Ocean Institute 2001). The majority of fish landed in the Western Indian Ocean 
  Islands are from coastal waters, and molluscs, prawns, shrimp and lobster are 
  important economically and in local diets. Mauritius and Seychelles are also 
  exploiting open sea tuna fisheries on a more commercial scale, and shrimp fisheries, 
  which have a high potential for foreign exchange earnings from export, are growing 
  in importance in Madagascar.</p>
