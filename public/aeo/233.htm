<h3>PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE ACTION </h3>
<p>Priorities for action include strengthening of existing mechanisms by investment 
  in equipment and personnel, as well as enhancement of coordination between government 
  departments and other related organizations, so that environmental and development 
  issues are integrated into all decision making at the national and sub-regional 
  level. <a href="321.htm">Chapter 5</a> offers a more comprehensive and integrated 
  analysis of policy options and makes specific recommendations. However, some 
  broad outlines for progress can be extracted from the analysis presented in 
  this chapter, these include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using climate change fora to exert pressure on the international community 
    to implement the proposed mechanisms for emissions trading, reforestation 
    schemes, and cleaner development, measures from which everyone stands to gain 
    economically and environmentally.</li>
  <li>Implementation of national and sub-regional action plans developed under 
    the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries 
    Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa 
    (UNCCD).</li>
  <li>Strengthening of hazard monitoring programmes and early warning and response 
    systems to effectively mitigate and cope with the impacts of extreme events, 
    increase food security, and maintain healthy ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Diversification of economies to alleviate dependence on agricultural production, 
    forestry, fisheries, and other natural resources. In particular, new economic 
    activities should focus on valueaddition to the natural resources that are 
    exported, to ensure that maximum benefit accrues to Africa (in terms of employment, 
    skills development, income, and foreign exchange).</li>
  <li>Advancing trade negotiations to create a more equitable and operational 
    international market for African products.</li>
  <li>Radical reforms to the energy and transport sectors, including: development 
    and adoption of appropriate clean technologies (to alleviate dependence on 
    wood and fossil fuels without increasing emissions of GHGs, removal of subsidies, 
    promotion of unleaded fuels and conversion to cleaner fuels, and upgrading 
    of public transport systems.</li>
  <li>Integration of natural resources management programmes, such as ICZM and 
    IWRM programmes. In particular, development of administrative frameworks is 
    required to improve coordination between departments responsible for coastal 
    planning, development, and use of resources. Measures to manage demand also 
    need to be established and implemented so that rates of consumption of resources 
    are brought down to sustainable levels. This can be done through financial 
    incentives such as true-cost pricing. In addition, an effective system for 
    enforcing regulations is required.</li>
  <li>EIAs should be conducted as part of proactive and holistic development planning. 
    These should be integrated into an overall development plan for a region or 
    area, so that cumulative impacts of all developments are considered and habitat 
    loss and fragmentation are minimized. Highest priority should be given to 
    improved urban planning, provision and maintenance of basic infrastructure 
    and services, and to innovations in design to meet the demand for housing 
    sustainably.</li>
  <li>Valuation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in forests 
    and woodlands, and economic reforms to the forestry sector, so that the true 
    value of forests and woodlands is reflected in the prices, and so that harvesting 
    rates are adjusted accordingly.</li>
  <li>Sustained participation by all stakeholders in management of natural resources, 
    through open and transparent governance systems, involvement in community-level 
    projects, and representation in regional resource management programmes such 
    as river basin management or management of protected areas.</li>
  <li>Strengthening of national efforts to meet the objectives of the United Nations 
    Convention on Biological Diversity, including establishment of strategies 
    for sustainable resource use, from within and outside of protected areas. 
    In addition, indigenous knowledge and intellectual property rights need to 
    be protected so that the development potential of African resources can be 
    realized with benefits accruing to African countries and communities. Tighter 
    trade restrictions need to be enforced to sustain the progress made in reducing 
    poaching and illegal trade.</li>
  <li>Reform of tenure and access policies is a priority for nearly all African 
    countries. Improving security of tenure encourages sound environmental management 
    practices and sustainable production levels. Tenure reform will also raise 
    the status of women and other disadvantaged groups, giving them equal opportunities 
    and raising social development standards.</li>
  <li>Above all, these activities must be integrated into development and poverty-alleviation 
    strategies, so that economic, social and environmental development priorities 
    do not compete with one another, but are rather considered simultaneously 
    and are addressed through mutually beneficial means.</li>
