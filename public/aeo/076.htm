<p>In 1999, Kenya enacted a very comprehensive Environmental Management and Co-ordination 
  Act. Under this Act, the new guidelines for environmental impact assessment 
  (EIA), will contain a provision for the inclusion of traditional holders of 
  knowledge in a technical advisory committee for the EIA process. The EIA will 
  take into account the potential impacts of projects on local cultures and the 
  views of local communities in the assessment process as well as in the review 
  process (Berger & Mugo 2001). Uganda has also formulated a national policy on 
  Indigenous Knowledge, under the World Bank's Programme on Indigenous Knowledge 
  in Africa.</p>
<p>Kenya has established a wide range of institutions for the managemnt of biodiversity. 
  These research institutions specialise in areas such as agriculture and livestock, 
  as well as monitoring and research in forestry, fisheries, wildlife and rangelands. 
  The National Museums of Kenya (NMK) houses a Centre for Biodiversity, as well 
  as the East Africa Natural History Society, and the Kenya Research Centre for 
  Indigenous Knowledge. NMK is also affiliated with the Institute for Primate 
  Research. The Kenya Wildlife Service is the major body whose madate is the conservation 
  and management of wildlife and Kenya's National Park system.</p>
<p>Because most of Kenya's wildlife exists outside of its National Parks, Kenyans 
  have been experimenting with a range of community and private initiatives to 
  set up tourism or ecotourism enterprises on their land. These ventures may involve 
  the setting aside of game viewing areas on large private ranches, or on group 
  ranches, and sometimes collaboration between groups and individual ranchers 
  to increase the total area of land available for conservation and ecotourism 
  activities. Il Ngwesi, a 16 500 acre group ranch in the northern area of Kenya, 
  opened a small lodge in 1996, grossed US$40,000 in 2000 and is expecting more 
  than double that in 2001 (Johnstone, 2001). The Mara Conservancy, in the Trans 
  Mara area of Kenya, is a new initiative aimed at ensuring that the local community 
  actually receives the proceeds from tourism activities carried out in their 
  area. Several group ranches have subcontracted a private company to manage their 
  game viewing area, collect entry fees, reinvest a proportion into the infrastructure 
  of the reserve, and pay the rest into the community (Daily Nation, 13 December 
  2001).</p>
<p>Ecotourism and conservation enterprises can be part of an effort by pastoral 
  communities to stop the sub-division, sale and subsequent encroachment of settlement 
  onto their common grazing land, which interferes with their traditional livelihood 
  activities. Some of the Maasai residents of a former conservation area located 
  next to Nairobi National Park (and part of the wildlife dispersal area) are 
  attempting to reintegrate use of the riverine forest and grazing land to attract 
  tourists and dissuade members of the scheme from selling off small plots of 
  land for settlement (Ole Kaasha 2001). On a different tack, the Loita Maasai 
  of Kenya responded firmly to attempts to include the sacred Loita Forest as 
  part of the Maasai Mara game reserve, to be developed for tourism. As part of 
  a series of efforts to prevent the alienation of this forest and the loss of 
  its biodiversity, the Loita Maasai went to court to seek legal entitlement, 
  invoking Article 8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Stephenson 
  1999).</p>
<p>Other conservation measures include the reintroduction of species to areas 
  from which they had formerly been eradicated, and management of wildlifelivestock 
  interactions. For example giraffes were successfully re-introduced from Kenya 
  into Kidepo Valley National Park, Uganda, and there are plans underway to re-introduce 
  black rhino to Uganda. In July 2001, the Kenya Wildlife Service translocated 
  56 elephants from the Sweetwaters Rhino Sanctuary in Laikipia district, to Meru 
  National Park. Meru's elephant herds were decimated during the 1960s and 1970s. 
  This is the sixth major operation of this kind in Eastern Africa since 1996, 
  and is one way that the KWS is handling wildlife-human conflicts (Situma 2001). 
  The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme, the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group 
  and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization have started a programme 
  to vaccinate dogs against rabies, canine distemper and canine parvovirus in 
  and around the Bale Mountains National Park. The programme will not only help 
  curb the spread of diseases that are a threat to this critically endangered 
  species, but it will also benefit local communities, by reducing the number 
  of deaths of humans and their livestock from rabies. Another initiative is to 
  encourage responsible dog ownership, and the neutering of both male and female 
  dogs (Laurenson and others 1998, Vigne 1999).</p>
