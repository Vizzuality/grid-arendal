<h3>EXTENT AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CULTIVATION AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN 
  NORTHERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>The total area under cultivation in the sub-region has grown from approximately 
  35 million ha in 1970 to more than 45 million ha in 1999 (FAOSTAT 2001). Sudan 
  has witnessed the most dramatic expansion (from 11 million ha in 1970 to 17 
  million ha in 2000), although there are still large areas of land with potential 
  for cultivation, which have not yet been exploited (FAOSTAT 2001). For other 
  countries, most or all arable land is under cultivation, due to significant 
  technological and engineering developments. These include: the construction 
  of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River in Egypt; the Al-Salam canal development, 
  which diverts water from the Nile River to Sinai, Egypt; and the great covered 
  human-made river in Libya (Hegazy 1999). In other countries, the potential for 
  expansion has been limited by: availability of water resources; inequity of 
  land resource distribution; availability of capital investment; human resources; 
  supply of energy; and prevailing soil characteristics.</p>
<p>The percentage of cultivated land that is irrigated has also expanded considerably 
  over the past 30 years, from 6 million ha in 1970 to nearly 8 million ha in 
  1999 (FAOSTAT 2001). Irrigated area as a percentage of agricultural area varies 
  from 100 per cent in Egypt to about 15 per cent in Morocco and Sudan, where 
  rainfed agriculture is more reliable (FAOSTAT 2001). This expansion has been 
  outstripped by population growth, however, as shown by declining area of cultivated 
  land per capita, which fell from 0.59 ha/capita in 1970 to 0.33 ha/capita in 
  1990 (calculated from FAOSTAT 2001). Total crop and livestock production has 
  also increased over the past decade but, again, the rapid increase in population 
  has resulted in a net decline in per capita production, as shown in <a href="#fig2f6">Figure 
  2f.6</a> and <a href="#fig2f7">Figure 2f.7</a> (FAOSTAT 2001).</p>
<p>Intensification and expansion of food production have contributed to food self-sufficiency 
  and food security in the sub-region. However, imports far exceed exports, and 
  the gap between imports and exports is growing (Miladi 1999). Northern Africa 
  has high selfsufficiency in vegetables, fruits and tuber crops (more than 97 
  per cent) but, for sugar, cereals and plant oils, self-sufficiency rates are 
  33.2 per cent, 57.3 per cent and 62.7 per cent respectively (Arab League 1999).</p>
