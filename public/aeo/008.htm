<h3>CALL TO ACTION</h3>
<p>Most African countries face many challenges, such as the need to reduce poverty 
  and improve the quality of life of their people and to improve the state of 
  the environment. These need to be addressed from a policy perspective in order 
  for the region to move closer to sustainable development.</p>
<p>A key aim of AEO is to recommend 'achievable action items' to AMCEN, as Africa's 
  environmental body, and to other relevant policy officials. Urgent actions are 
  required to reverse the current trend in environmental degradation in Africa. 
  The key issues for action are poverty reduction and reversal of the direct causes 
  of environmental degradation, by addressing environment and development together. 
  There are also a number of cross-cutting issues that affect Africa's quest for 
  sustainable development.</p>
<p>Specific actions are summarized below in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eradicating poverty</li>
  <li>Halting and reversing environmental degradation</li>
  <li>Promoting actions on crosscutting issues.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Eradicating poverty</h4>
<p>Poverty is a complex issue requiring a multi-dimensional approach and there 
  is no uniform solution to its eradication. In Africa, poverty is considered 
  to be both an agent and a consequence of environmental degradation. Because 
  poverty reduction is pivotal to sustainable development, African countries are 
  called upon to direct attention and resources to poverty challenges in the region 
  through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>endorsement and promotion of principles of sustainable development;</li>
  <li>acceleration of industrial development;</li>
  <li>securing food-self sufficiency and food security; and</li>
  <li>reversing the health crisis, including overcoming the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Halting and reversing environmental degradation</h4>
<p>The problems of socio-economic development in Africa are inextricably linked 
  to people, resources and the environment. Environmental conservation thus relates 
  directly to the structure and functioning of the economy given that the majority 
  of African people derive their livelihood directly from natural resources. The 
  region is, however, losing its resources at relatively rapid rates, thereby 
  leaving millions of people vulnerable to adverse environmental change. Future 
  strategies and actions aimed at halting and reversing environmental degradation 
  must include and prioritize:</p>
<ul>
  <li>halting and reversing desertification and land degradation;</li>
  <li>conservation and management of biodiversity and forest resources, including 
    wetland and crossborder ecosystems;</li>
  <li>climate change mitigation and improvement of air quality;</li>
  <li>improvement of access to and quality of freshwater resources;</li>
  <li>conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems and resources; and</li>
  <li>promotion of environmentally-sound management of toxic wastes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Promoting action on cross-cutting issues</h4>
<p>A number of cross-cutting issues require urgent attention in Africa in order 
  to halt and reverse environmental degradation and reduce vulnerability. These 
  are wide-ranging and must include such important areas as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>mobilization of domestic and international financial resources for sustainable 
    development;</li>
  <li>promoting trade;</li>
  <li>promoting peace building, good governance and human rights;</li>
  <li>enhancement of scientific and technological base;</li>
  <li>accelerating regional cooperation and integration;</li>
  <li>promoting the role of civil society; and</li>
  <li>promoting the development of human resources.</li>
</ul>
