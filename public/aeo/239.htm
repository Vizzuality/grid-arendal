<h4>Impacts of freshwater mismanagement and pollution</h4>
<p>In terms of freshwater, at least 13 countries suffered water stress or scarcity 
  (less than 1 700 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/a and less than 1 000 m<sup>3</sup>/capita/a 
  respectively) in 1990. The number is projected to double by 2025 (PAI 1995). 
  While 62 per cent of people in the region had access to an improved water supply 
  in 2000, rural Africans spend much time searching for water as water sources 
  become more distant and harder to locate. A total of 28 per cent of the global 
  population without access to improved water supplies live in Africa (WHO and 
  UNICEF 2000). </p>
<p>Freshwater and groundwater pollution is a growing concern in many areas, further 
  limiting access to safe water. Poor water quality leads not only to water-related 
  diseases, but also reduces agricultural production, meaning that more foodstuffs 
  and agricultural products must be imported. Poor water quality also limits economic 
  development options, such as water-intensive industries and tourism, a situation 
  that is potentially disastrous to developing countries in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="img34"></a>Droughts are probably the most serious factor in terms 
  of human vulnerability to environmental change. Eastern Africa, for example, 
  has suffered at least one drought per decade for the past 30 years (CRED-OFDA 
  2000). In the 1970s in Ethiopia, drought killed 400 000 people, and about 1.2 
  million others were displaced. About a decade later, in 1984-85, a total of 
  7.8 million Ethiopians were affected, causing 1 million deaths. For a region 
  which is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, drought is an ill omen. In times 
  of drought, for example, a drop in water levels in dams and rivers may affect 
  the concentration of sewage and other effluent in rivers, resulting in outbreaks 
  of diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentry and cholera. Reduced water flows during 
  droughts also decrease the capacity of rivers, streams and swamps to dilute 
  agro-chemicals and fertilizers in fields, adversely affecting soil ecosystems 
  and potential agricultural production. These drought-related problems are likely 
  to increase under projected climate change, although vulnerabilities and control 
  measures will affect the impact (IPCC 1998).</p>
<p>The poor are usually the most affected by flood or drought-induced crop failure. 
  Malnutrition and famine have resulted from both droughts and floods, and food 
  imports and dependency on food aid associated with this have contributed to 
  limiting the economic growth of affected countries. For example, in the Horn 
  of Africa, where 76 per cent of the population is classed as agricultural, there 
  is an important connection between food security and poverty (FAO 2001) because, 
  for the majority of the poor, agriculture is the main source of livelihood. 
  Several processes of environmental vulnerability are at play in the Horn of 
  Africa: drought, which causes widespread periodic famine in the region; localized 
  floods; and the threat of locust swarms (FAO 2001). Power generation, which 
  drives economic activity, is also affected by episodes of drought, leading to 
  load shedding or power outages.</p>
<p>Floods also contribute to the vulnerability of people in Africa. In Southern 
  Africa, for example, the devastating floods of 1999-2000 affected more than 
  150 000 families (Mpofu 2000). Mozambique alone lost US$273 million in physical 
  damage, US$247 million in lost production, US$48 million in lost exports and 
  US$31 million in increased imports as a result of the flooding (Mozambique National 
  News Agency 2000). Degradation of wetlands, such as the Kafue wetlands in Zambia, 
  damming of rivers, deforestation and overgrazing lowered the environment's ability 
  to absorb excess water, and magnified the impact of the floods (Chenje 2000, 
  UNDHA 1994). Poor water supply and sanitation led to high rates of water-related 
  diseases such as ascaris, cholera, diarrhoea, dracunculosis, dysentery, eye 
  infections, hookworm, scabies, schistosomiasis and trachoma. About 3 million 
  people in Africa die annually as a result of water-related diseases (Lake and 
  Souré 1997). In 1998, 72 per cent of all reported cholera cases in the world 
  were in Africa.</p>
