<h4>Towards sustainable urban settlements</h4>
<p>The two most influential movements over the last 30 years for improving conditions 
  in urban settlements have been the creation of the United Nations Commission 
  for Human Settlements (Habitat) (UNCHS) and Local Agenda 21.</p>
<p>Habitat was established in October 1978 to provide leadership and coordination 
  for the activities of the United Nations in the field of human settlements. 
  Habitat's mission is to promote socially and environmentally sustainable development 
  of human settlements and the achievement of adequate shelter for all. The Habitat 
  Agenda was adopted as the global plan of action for achieving this mission at 
  the Habitat II Conference, held in Istanbul, Turkey, in June 1996. In the lead 
  up to the Conference, African Ministers responsible for housing and urban development 
  met in Kampala, Uganda. They recognized the need for urbanization in relation 
  to economic development, but stressed the need to improve rural facilities and 
  rural-urban linkages to slow the rate of urbanization. They also endorsed the 
  decisions of the Dakar Declaration to involve stakeholders, build capacity in 
  urban authorities, establish enhanced urban environmental management, and develop 
  and implement national environmental action plans.</p>
<p>The other framework for action, the Local Agenda 21 programme, is expressly 
  called for in Agenda 21 (Chapter 28) which encourages local authorities to enter 
  into dialogue and to develop a process that is specifically designed to help 
  achieve sustainable development at the local level, in the same way as Agenda 
  21 promotes this at the national and global level.</p>

            <p>African cities have been setting standards internationally for 
              their progress in achieving sustainable growth and improving living 
              conditions. The 1998 Global 100 Best Practices List, drawn up by 
              the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements to recognise various 
              elements of urban development, contained eight African projects, 
              and two award winning projects, one from Angola and one from Sudan. 
              These best practices encompassed environmental management, children 
              and youth centres, infrastructure development, sustainable community 
              design and architecture, and poverty eradication.</p>

<p><a name="box2g1"></a>Although implementation of the Habitat Agenda and of Agenda 
  21 has been constrained, largely by lack of funding, many African cities have 
  made remarkable achievements (see <a href="#box2g1">Box 2g.1</a>). These include 
  the revision or formulation of constitutions and national legislation to promote 
  the right to adequate shelter-almost 80 per cent of African countries now legally 
  recognize this right (UNCHS 2001b). Thirteen out of 29 African countries recently 
  studied recognize women's rights to own property, and more are revising or developing 
  policies to this effect (UNCHS 2001b). Environmental policies are also being 
  overhauled, and many African countries now require environmental impact assessments 
  to be conducted prior to new developments such as housing, commercial development 
  or road construction. Integrated water policies and waste management strategies 
  are being developed, and municipal services are also being privatized in many 
  urban centres, in an effort to improve coverage and maintenance. Effluent standards 
  and tighter controls on waste management are also being developed and implemented 
  to encourage responsible waste disposal. Housing programmes, subsidies for low-income 
  families, poverty alleviation programmes, and decentralization strategies are 
  additional measures being used to relieve the social, economic, and environmental 
  burden currently concentrated on urban areas.</p>
<p>In 1995, officials from concerned African cities met and formed the African 
  Sustainable Cities Network (ASCN), to build capacity in participatory environmental 
  planning within local authorities. The members started the process with an environmental 
  management needs assessment, followed by a phased programme of education and 
  training, establishing a framework for implementing new national environmental 
  policies, and creating local sustainable development strategies. By June 2000, 
  31 African cities had joined the network and had embarked on activities (ICLEI 
  2001).</p>
