<p>Coastal erosion has been recognized as one of the most crucial issues along 
  the coast of Western African with erosion rates of 23-30 m per year being recorded 
  in some areas (Smith, Huq, Lenhart, Mata, Nemesova & Toure 1996). Mining of 
  sand and gravel from estuaries, beaches, and directly from the continental shelf 
  contributes to coastal erosion and shoreline retreat. In some cases, construction 
  of ports and harbours perpendicular to the littoral zone can cause acute down-drift 
  erosion and this has been experienced in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, 
  Nigeria and Togo. The Bight of Benin, off the coast of Guinea, is an area particularly 
  affected by erosion resulting from the construction of jetties and large harbours 
  with breakwaters extending into the sea, dredging activities, and the extraction 
  of sand for construction (Wellens- Mensah 1994). Accentuated erosion has also 
  been documented in the Niger Delta. This is one of the impacts of offshore oil 
  production, causing subsidence of the continental shelf and effectively raising 
  the sea level (Chidi Ibe, Awosika, Ihenyen, Ibe & Tiamiyu 1985).</p>
<p>Construction of the Akosombo Dam in Ghana and the Kainji Dam in Nigeria has 
  lowered the sediment loads in rivers that reach the coast by up to 40 per cent, 
  making less sediment available to replace that eroded or extracted in the coastal 
  zone (Wellens-Mensah 1994). As a result, coastal erosion east of Accra has been 
  accelerated, reaching a rate of 6 m/yr. In Togo and Benin, coastal retreat has 
  exceeded 150 m over the past 20 years and is threatening the potential for future 
  development in the coastal zone (UNEP 1999b).</p>
<p>Climate change scenarios for the sub-region predict increases in frequency 
  and intensity of tidal waves and storm surges which will exacerbate erosion 
  problems by moving greater amounts of coastal material (Allersman and Tilsmans 
  1993). Predictions also include a rise in sea level of one metre which would 
  result in land loss of 18 000 km<sup>2</sup> along the Western African coast. 
  Major cities such as Banjul, Abidjan, Tabaou, Grand Bassam, Sassandra, San Pedro 
  Lagos, and Port Harcourt would be inundated, with damage to infrastructure, 
  and displacement of populations (Jallow, Barrow & Leatherman 1996, ICST 1996; 
  Awosika, Chidi Ibe & Schroeder 1993). Inundation of Dakar, in Senegal, for which 
  conditions are described above, would also create a significant problem of relocation 
  and resettlement (Dennis, Niang-Diop & Nicholls 1995).</p>

<p><a name="img2c12"></a>Natural habitats and resources are also at risk from 
  sea level rise. Mangroves, for example, constitute an important resource as 
  they stabilize coastal lands, prevent erosion and provide breeding grounds and 
  sheltered habitats for many species and provide raw materials for medicine, 
  food, and construction to the local communities. Inundation of these habitats 
  would displace many species and disrupt the economic activities they support.</p>
<p>Sea level rise of more than one metre would flood over 15 000 km<sup>2</sup> 
  of the Niger Delta and force up to 80 per cent of the population to higher ground, 
  with consequent damage to property estimated by the IPCC at US$9 000 million 
  (World Bank 1996b, Leatherman & Nicholls 1995). The Niger Delta encompasses 
  wetlands and lagoons that are the spawning grounds for commercial shrimp and 
  oysters, and bait-fish for the large tuna industry. It also contains 1 300 oil 
  wells responsible for 90 per cent of Nigeria's oil exports and foreign exchange 
  earnings (French, Awosika & Ibe 1995). Flooding would disturb these habitats 
  and economic activities and could worsen problems associated with oil pollution.</p>
<h4>Mitigation of coastal erosion and climate change in Western Africa</h4>
<p>Coastal protection measures to date have included piecemeal construction of 
  groynes, sea walls and other physical barriers, often at high costs and, in 
  many cases, further contributing to the problem rather than curbing it (Wellens-Mensah 
  1994). An integrated, holistic framework for preventing coastal erosion is required 
  to address the causes of erosion inland as well as those in the coastal zone. 
  As erosion accelerates under sea level rise, considerable financial resources 
  will need to be accessed and allocated, for example to build sea walls along 
  the Barrier Coast (near Lagos). Protection of the oil wells in the Niger Delta 
  will be another significant cost (French and others 1995). New drilling technologies 
  may have to be developed and harbours will require upgrading, to maintain their 
  functionality.</p>
