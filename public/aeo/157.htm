<h4>Access to freshwater in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Even where freshwater is potentially available, it is not always accessible. 
  In Ethiopia, for example, despite an extensive network of lakes and rivers, 
  only 24 per cent of the country's population has access to clean water, and 
  only 13 per cent in the rural areas (WHO/UNICEF 2000). In Djibouti, by contrast, 
  water supply and sanitation coverage is 100 per cent in both urban and rural 
  areas (WHO/UNICEF 2000). A significant barrier to the effective development 
  of water storage, treatment and supply has been the fragmentation of responsibilities 
  amongst government departments, as illustrated by the Ethiopian example (see 
  <a href="#box2e5">Box 2e.5</a>).</p>

            <p>Until the early 1990s, there were eight public agencies involved 
              in the development and provision of water resources in Ethiopia. 
              The National Water Resources Commission was responsible for irrigation. 
              The Water Resource Development Agency was responsible for the design, 
              implementation and operation of largeand medium-scale irrigation 
              projects. The Irrigation Development Department within the Ministry 
              of Agriculture was entrusted with the planning and construction 
              of small-scale irrigation. Feasibility studies and planning of irrigation 
              schemes was undertaken by the Ethiopian Valleys Development Studies 
              Authority and the Water Well Drilling Agency, which took over from 
              the Valleys Development Agency and the Development Projects Studies 
              Authority. The Ethiopian Water Works Construction Agency constructed 
              all water project infrastructure, and the Water Supply and Sewerage 
              Authority supplied water services and sanitation for urban and rural 
              settlements. Not surprisingly, there was often a great deal of duplication 
              of effort and wastage of resources among these myriad, autonomous 
              and semi-autonomous agencies. There was also incomplete geographical 
              coverage of water service provision. In 1994, the Ministry of Water 
              Resources was established as a single, unified public agency responsible 
              for water development in Ethiopia.</p>

<h4>Improving availability and access to freshwater in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>The major international programmes for water resources management in the sub-region 
  are the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Programme (LVEMP) and the Nile 
  Basin Initiative. The LVEMP was established in 1995, with funding from GEF. 
  The focus was primarily on: fisheries management; pollution control; control 
  of invasive weeds; and catchment land use management. The achievements to date 
  include: bio-control of water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes); involvement of 
  local communities in fisheries research and management; and afforestation in 
  the surrounding catchment.</p>
<p>At the national level, policy responses include: revision of water resources 
  development policies; improved reticulation and treatment; and greater involvement 
  of stakeholders in water management and supply. In Kenya, water and sanitation 
  schemes have been commercialized in pilot areas in Kericho, Eldoret and Nyeri. 
  These pilot studies will test whether privatization contributes to meeting the 
  goals of the Kenyan Water Act (Cap. 372), namely, to enhance the provision, 
  conservation, control, apportionment and use of water in Kenya. The international 
  donor organization, SIDA, is also providing support to the government of Kenya 
  to produce a new water policy that will support the rights of villages to own 
  and run their own water systems (SIDA 2000).</p>
<p>Uganda's long-term goal for the water sector is a system of full cost-recovery 
  for services provided, but with the provision of cross-subsidized safe water 
  services for low-income groups. The responsibility for water supply in urban 
  areas has been decentralized away from the national Water Development Department, 
  to local authorities. Safe water and sanitation facilities in Uganda have been 
  improved, although rural supply rates (less than 50 per cent of the population) 
  lag behind urban supply rates (60-75 per cent) (NEMA 2001). A National Wetlands 
  Policy was formulated and passed by the Ugandan government in 1994, calling 
  for, amongst other things: capacity building for wetlands management; public 
  awareness; and wetlands resource assessment. Where housing construction design 
  permits, rainwater is also being harvested.</p>
<p>In 2001, Ethiopia initiated a process to develop a sectoral strategic action 
  plan for the realization of the objectives of the national water policy. The 
  strategy prioritizes the interest and roles of different stakeholders, who are 
  invited to make inputs to the strategy development.</p>
