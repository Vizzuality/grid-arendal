<h4>Environmental consequences</h4>
<h4><i>Atmosphere</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, the increased economic activity across Africa-spearheaded 
  by Côte de Ivoire, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa-sees the number of least 
  developed countries in the region go down to just five, compared to 33 at the 
  beginning of the century. Increased manufacturing leads to serious problems 
  of air and water pollution. Governments introduce stringent measures to curb 
  such pollution, including the polluter pays principle and trade-in pollution 
  permits. The polluter pays principle is strictly enforced, and companies start 
  to introduce selfpolicing measures. These measures subsequently see pollution 
  gradually decrease as the permits increasingly become more expensive, thus making 
  the products of polluters more costly and less competitive.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>The harmonization of regulations allows for pollution control, but the sub-region 
  continues to suffer the consequences resulting from pollution from the north. 
  The development of an air pollution observatory helps to intervene with regards 
  to levels of pollution.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa</i></p>
<p>The issue of atmospheric pollution takes centre stage as public health policies 
  become strict and assertive. Vehicle emissions are strictly regulated and alternative 
  sources of energy, such as solar power, is promoted. The Montreal Protocol on 
  ozone-depleting substances (ODS) is enforced throughout the sub-region, with 
  the customs departments strictly monitoring the illegal movement of such substances. 
  The use of methyl bromide is phased out in the flower industry.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, governments take good steps towards improving 
  and preserving air quality in this sub-region. More people switch from using 
  private cars to using better and reliable public transport services. Vehicles 
  which run on natural gas are offered lower licensing fees. Solar energy is used 
  in tourism and housing developments, because the units are manufactured locally 
  and, hence, become affordable. The emission of greenhouse gases from industry, 
  power generation and some agricultural activities is controlled through government-set 
  regulations. The cooling and air-conditioning industries are banned from using 
  CFCs and other environmentally harmful products. The overall improvement in 
  air quality has positive effects on public health.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa</i></p>
<p>Improvements in early warning systems result in the subregion being better 
  prepared to handle climate variability. The impacts of climate variability become 
  very much reduced, as a result of new technologies producing seed varieties 
  which can withstand variable climatic conditions, and also as a result of better 
  housing.</p>
<p><i><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/aeo/images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, as a result of years of scientific research 
  and successes elsewhere, a 'clean air' policy is institutionalized-at the level 
  of the home, workplace and community, and across national borders-through education, 
  broad consultation and encouragement, led by government. All major environmentally 
  harmful products which cause air pollution are banned or controlled. Vehicle, 
  aircraft and air conditioning gases, gases for home use and other gases are 
  controlled. Industrial pollution remains at current levels of manageability. 
  The major oil producing country, Nigeria, leads the 'clean air' campaign by 
  putting adequate measures in place. Major petroleum refineries in the sub-region 
  are modernized, and use processing methods which have very few pollutants.</p>

<p>Pollution levels are reduced in intensity, but careful monitoring shows that 
  they are now extending into more urban areas as the use of motor vehicles increases.</p>
