<h4>Social issues</h4>
<p>Although improvements in social indicators have been sustained across the globe, 
  Africa has lagged behind other world regions. Half of the population in Africa 
  lacks access to health services. In rural Africa, about 65 per cent of the population 
  are without access to adequate water supply, and 73 per cent are without access 
  to adequate sanitation. In urban areas, about 25 per cent and 43 per cent of 
  the population are without access to adequate water supply and sanitation, respectively 
  (World Commission on Water 2000). The average adult illiteracy rate stands at 
  42 per cent. Life expectancy, which has steadily increased over the past decade 
  to an average of 54 years, is expected to fall by 17 years as a result of the 
  HIV/AIDS epidemic in many countries (ECA 2000). Health challenges are monumental 
  in a region with the highest rates of fertility, maternal and childhood mortality, 
  malnutrition, two-thirds of the world's known AIDS cases and 90 per cent of 
  the world's annual malaria fatalities, and where half of the female population 
  is illiterate.</p>
<p>Social development in African countries manifests in many dimensions, which 
  cut across poverty and the declining standards of living, as well as issues 
  of access to facilities and social security. On the one hand, there are issues 
  of the provision and maintenance of basic human services and, on the other hand, 
  issues of the consequences of the failure to do these successfully. When they 
  became independent, most African countries inherited a system where government 
  was absolutely responsible for providing these services and amenities, at almost 
  no direct cost to consumers. Over the years, the ability of governments to meet 
  the demands for providing basic services and utilities has decreased tremendously, 
  and the effect has been one of aggravating social conditions in which nationals 
  live. According to the latest UN figures, African nations rank, on average, 
  lower than any other continent on the Human Development Index (HDI). Furthermore, 
  more than 70 per cent of the countries in Africa rank 'low' on this index. In 
  some cases, the HDI has suffered decreases, rather than improvements, over the 
  years. Moreover, there are also great inequalities in the distribution of income, 
  opportunity and social welfare.</p>
<p>Many countries have programmes which directly address these inequalities, while 
  some have formulated development strategies designed to alleviate the problems 
  of poverty and inequities. These inequalities remain today and, in some cases, 
  manifest themselves in more serious forms than in the early days of independence. 
  Compared with the rest of the world, social indicators show Africa as the least 
  developed region, even though there are instances where improvements have been 
  made, for example, in the areas of health, birth and deaths, fertility and educational 
  development. In the area of educational development, the level of literacy has 
  risen considerably in the region, and the quality of trained personnel has equally 
  improved. African countries have witnessed the phenomenon of 'brain drain', 
  whereby the best-trained of its manpower resources migrate into developed countries.</p>
<p>Poverty remains both a cause and an effect of environmenta1 degradation, and 
  is the main social and economic challenge for Africa. Poverty can be reduced, 
  either by increasing economic growth or by reducing inequity. For Africa to 
  cut poverty in half by 2015, it will require an average annual GDP growth rate 
  of 7 per cent. Although there has been significant progress in education in 
  Africa over the past two decades, there is much to be done. Primary school enrollment 
  in 16 countries is less than 60 per cent, and there are more children aged 6-11 
  years out of school than was the case in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Although African women have made tremendous progress over the past four decades, 
  there is still a gap between rhetoric and action in order to maintain the momentum 
  of this progress in Africa. Economic and legal barriers, associated with social 
  discrimination, continue to prevent women in Africa from improving their status 
  and productivity, and from achieving their full potential.</p>
