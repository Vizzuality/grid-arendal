<h1 class="prelims">THE AEO PROJECT</h1>
<h3>ORIGINS</h3>
<p>The Eighth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment 
  (AMCEN) which was held in Abuja, Nigeria in April, 2000 approved AMCEN's medium-term 
  programme, a key element of which was the production of the Africa Environment 
  Outlook report. This decision was affirmed at the AMCEN Inter-sessional Committee, 
  which met in Malmo, Sweden in May 2000. In response to this, the AMCEN Secretariat-the 
  United Nations Environment Programme Regional Office for Africa (ROA)-in collaboration 
  with the Division of Early Warning and Assessment (DEWA) embarked on a process 
  to produce the Africa Environment Outlook report.</p>
<h3>THE AEO PROCESS</h3>
<h5>Partnership</h5>
<p>The AEO report process has been based on wide consultation and participation 
  between UNEP and various partners in the Africa region. It therefore reflects 
  a variety of sub-regional perspectives and priorities. The AEO process involves 
  partnership with six collaborating centres (see page v) responsible for producing 
  subregional state of the environment and policy retrospective reports for Central 
  Africa, Eastern Africa, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, Western Africa and 
  the Western Indian Ocean Islands. These centres engaged individual and institutional 
  experts at the national and sub-regional level to provide inputs into the process.</p>
<p>Experts from specialized organizations were also involved in providing inputs 
  for sections of the report and in its review to ensure sub-regional balance, 
  scientific credibility, and comprehensiveness. They include, among others, The 
  UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), African Development Bank (ADB), the 
  Organisation for African Unity (OAU), Southern African Development Community 
  (SADC), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Economic Community 
  of West African States (ECOWAS), Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought 
  Control in the Sahel (CILSS), AMU and the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC).</p>
<h5>Sources of information</h5>
<p>In compiling the sub-regional inputs, national level information and data sources 
  were used. These data sources were then compared and harmonized with data available 
  from regional sources such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 
  UN Development Programme (UNDP), Africa Development Bank (ADB), The World Bank 
  and the World Resources Institute and others. A meeting of experts from the 
  Collaborating Centres took place to agree on harmonization of information and 
  standardization of data sources, to ensure consistency in the report.</p>
<h5>Capacity building</h5>
<p>The AEO report process has also successfully built capacity in state of the 
  environment reporting, policy analysis, scenario development and integrated 
  reporting, at national, sub-regional and regional levels in Africa. Capacity-building 
  workshops were organized at sub-regional level for national experts and NGOs 
  on the methodologies of state of the environment/policy retrospective reporting 
  using the State, Pressure, Impacts and Responses (PSIR) framework, including 
  methods of data management. A scenario development workshop was also held.</p>
<h3>THE AEO REPORT</h3>
<p>Africa Environment Outlook is the first comprehensive integrated report on 
  the African environment. The AEO assessment methodology is derived from UNEP's 
  cutting edge Global Environment Outlook (GEO) Process. The Africa Environment 
  Outlook (AEO) Process was initiated incorporating key attributes of the GEO 
  process, such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use of sound data, information and science;</li>
  <li>incorporation of regional and sub-regional perspectives;</li>
  <li>inclusion of multi-stakeholder perspectives;</li>
  <li>identification of priority and emerging issues such as human vulnerability 
    to environmental change;</li>
  <li>provision of early warning of impending threats;</li>
  <li>orientation toward sustainable development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why integrated environmental assessment reporting?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is a process of identifying environmental trends and conditions integrated 
    with the assessment of key driving forces while identifying leverage points 
    to decision makers.</li>
  <li>It goes beyond the scope of traditional state of the environment reporting 
    (SOE) which falls short of integrating the assessment of key driving forces 
    and policies that cause or influence environmental trends.</li>
  <li>It answers four consecutive questions that are key to effective decision 
    making. They are;<br>
    1. What is happening to the environment?<br>
    2. Why is it happening<br>
    3. What can we do and what are we doing about it?<br>
    4. What will happen if we don't act now?</li>
  <li>It brings together information and insight that is usually dispersed across 
    disciplines and institutions.</li>
  <li>It is a tool to aid communication between science and policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Africa Environment Outlook </i>aims to provide comprehensive, credible environmental 
  information in a way that is relevant to policy making. The structure, which 
  combines comprehensive environmental information with policy analysis, within 
  an overall context of socio-economic conditions and development imperatives, 
  is thus ideally suited to this purpose.</p>
<p>It provides recommendations for international cooperation and action and thus 
  can be used by subregional organizations and national environment departments 
  in developing national policies and international agreements.</p>
<p>The AEO report responds directly to Agenda 21, Chapter 40, which states:</p>
<p><i>'While considerable data already exist, as the various sectoral chapters 
  of Agenda 21 indicate, more and different types of data need to be collected, 
  at the local, provincial, national and international levels, indicating the 
  status and trends of the planet's ecosystem, natural resource, pollution and 
  socioeconomic variables. The gap in the availability, quality, coherence, standardization 
  and accessibility of data between the developed and the developing world has 
  been increasing, seriously impairing the capacities of countries to make informed 
  decisions concerning environment and development.</i></p>
<p><i>'There is a general lack of capacity, particularly in developing countries, 
  and in many areas at the international level, for the collection and assessment 
  of data, for their transformation into useful information, and their dissemination. 
  There is also need for improved coordination among environmental, demographic, 
  social and developmental data and information activities.'</i></p>
