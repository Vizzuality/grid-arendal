<h3>THE FORTRESS WORLD SCENARIO</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In the Fortress World scenario, the failure of the world to heed the need for 
  strong policy reforms on the environment leads to a state of complacency, with 
  governments retreating from social concerns and responsibilities. In such a 
  situation, development declines as poverty rises. Environmental conditions deteriorate 
  as pollution, climate change, land change and ecosystem degradation interact 
  to amplify the crisis. Environmental degradation, food insecurity and emergent 
  diseases foster a vast health crisis. Free market values are unable to constrain 
  environmental externalities. The affluent minority is alarmed by rampant migration, 
  terrorism and disease, and reacts with sufficient cohesion and strength to impose 
  an authoritarian 'Fortress World', where they flourish in protected enclaves 
  in rich nations and also in strongholds in poor nations. The fortresses are 
  bubbles of privilege amidst oceans of misery. The élite halts barbarism at its 
  gates, and enforces a kind of environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>At the African regional level, at the turn of the 21st century, there was optimism 
  about the future of Africa. The region's countries have made significant economic, 
  social and political progress over the past decade and, particularly, over the 
  past four years. However, such optimism, and the improvements made, are fragile. 
  Great challenges haunt the African future, and the threat of reversal of any 
  progress made is, in many cases, real. Among the challenges threatening the 
  sustainability of progress in Africa are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fast population growth, and rampant migration and urbanization;</li>
  <li>the spread of poverty (about 50 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan 
    Africa, and 20 per cent in North Africa, reside in absolute poverty);</li>
  <li>vulnerability to adverse external shocks, such as the 1997-98 Asian crisis;</li>
  <li>failure to recapitalize Africa;</li>
  <li>policy reversal;</li>
  <li>weak overall governance, and conflicts;</li>
  <li>the spread of diseases, including HIV/AIDS and malaria; and</li>
  <li>foreign and domestic debt, and debt servicing. With these challenges, African 
    countries are led to</li>
</ul>
<p>the emergence of a Fortress World scenario, in which African societies are 
  split into two groups: a small group of élite and public officials, who live 
  in a relatively prosperous conditions, but in a highly protected world; and 
  a poor majority, deprived of basic services and rights. The irony of a fortress 
  world crisis is the suffering, hardship and impoverishment incurred by the vast 
  majority of people at a time when a minority of élites live modern, prosperous 
  lives. The fortress world is a grim outlook for the future, in which social 
  and environmental problems lead increasingly to the authoritarian 'solutions' 
  of a minority of affluent people. Under such circumstances, members of the élite 
  organize themselves to live in protected enclaves, while the poor majority outside 
  of this fortress have few options and resources. A fortress world in Africa 
  could eventually lead to the complete breakdown of society, and also to the 
  emergence of new paradigms for a brighter future.</p>
<p>The assumptions of the Fortress World scenario may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing social and environmental problems lead to authoritarian 'solutions'.</li>
  <li>Members of the élite live in protected enclaves. These may or may not involve 
    a physical wall, and they may be within a country or between countries.</li>
  <li>Those in the fortresses reap the benefits of globalization. Those outside 
    the fortresses have few options and few resources, and are excluded from the 
    privileges of the élite.</li>
  <li>Components of the environment may actually improve under this scenario, 
    because valuable environmental resources are controlled by the élite.</li>
  <li>This improvement is not necessary unsustainable, but it may not be feasible 
    to maintain it for an indefinite time.</li>
</ul>
