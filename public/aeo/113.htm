<h2>SOUTHERN AFRICA </h2>
<p>The major issue for coastal countries of Southern Africa is the depletion of 
  fish stocks by unsustainable levels of harvesting. There are also increasing 
  incidences of pollution from activities on land and from oil spills and potential 
  impacts from sea level rise including inundation of major coastal settlements 
  with associated damage to ecosystems, infrastructure and displacement of populations.</p>
<h3>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS IN 
  SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>The Southern African coastline extends from Angola on the west (Atlantic) coast 
  to Tanzania on the east (Indian Ocean) coast. The coast is rich in fish, seafood, 
  mangroves and coral reefs as well as oil, diamonds and other mineral deposits. 
  The long sandy beaches and warm waters of the Indian Ocean create good opportunities 
  for tourism, and the many deep-water ports along the Southern African coast 
  present opportunities for industry and export.</p>
<p>These coastal resources are important economically, at the subsistence level 
  and commercially. In South Africa, for example, the annual revenue from coastal 
  resources has been estimated at more than US$17 500 million (approximately 37 
  per cent of South Africa's GDP). This includes revenues from transport and handling 
  of cargo, tourism and recreation, and commercial fishing industries (DEA&T 1998). 
  Mangrove forests along the east coast, from Tanzania to northern South Africa, 
  support a diversity of tree species that are used for furniture, firewood, building 
  dugout canoes, and of which the leaves are collected for animal fodder. Plants 
  are also used for medicinal purposes-<i>Xylocarpus granatum</i>, for example, 
  is said to cure stomach problems and hernia (Sousa 1998). Mangrove forests also 
  provide important nursery grounds and habitats for crustaceans and fish, exploited 
  by artisans and commercial fishermen alike. Estimates of the value of the shrimp 
  fisheries of the Sofala Bank (Mozambique), for example, are as high as US$50-60 
  million per year (Acreman 1999), or about 40 per cent to the country's net foreign 
  exchange earnings (Sousa 1997). The mangrove forests also protect the coastline 
  from storm surges and other natural hydrological influences such as high-amplitude 
  tidal ranges and disturbances resulting from currents (Tinley 1971).</p>
<h3>COASTAL EROSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
<p>Sea level rise as a result of global climate change would cause inundation 
  of the extensive mangroves of Mozambique and Tanzania and these would retreat, 
  thus increasing rates of erosion of the shoreline. The coastal lagoons of Angola 
  would also be inundated. Sea level rise is also a major threat to low-lying 
  coastal urban centres and ports, such as Cape Town, Maputo, and Dar es Salaam. 
  Its impacts could result in a loss of income from coastal industries and port 
  activities throughout the sub-region, as well as loss of opportunities for development 
  of tourism (IPCC 1998). In Tanzania, a sea level rise of 0.5 m would inundate 
  over 2 000 km<sup>2</sup> of land, costing around US$51 million and a rise of 
  1.0 m would inundate 2 100 km<sup>2</sup> of land and erode a further 9 km<sup>2</sup>, 
  resulting in costs of more than US$81 million (IPCC 1998).</p>
<p>The coral reefs off the coasts of Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania are 
  under threat of bleaching due to sea temperature rise resulting from El Niño 
  events and global climate change. In 1998, the El Niño induced sea temperature 
  rise of around 1&deg;C caused the death of up to 90 per cent of the corals in 
  the subregion (Obura and others 2000).</p>
<h4>Mitigation of the effects of climate change Southern Africa's coastal zone</h4>
<p>All countries of the sub-region, with the exception of Angola, have ratified 
  the UNFCCC but, as most of them (with the exception of South Africa) contribute 
  negligible amounts to global carbon dioxide emissions, more immediate mitigating 
  measures are required. Construction of physical barriers is a short-term measure 
  which has been implemented, but relocation of human settlements and industry 
  could also be considered.</p>
