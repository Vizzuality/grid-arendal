<a name="img310"></a>Most sub-Saharan African countries have been affected by 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) Structural Adjustment 
Programmes (SAPs) of economic reform, with varying results for their economies 
and varying effects on the poorest people (Benneh and others 1996). Adjustment 
policies have been characterized by: 
<ul>
  <li> removal by governments of subsidies on essential services, such as education, 
    health and transport; </li>
  <li>reduction of the civil service labour force through retrenchments; </li>
  <li>removal of subsidies on agricultural inputs; and </li>
  <li>liberalization of commodity prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the policies introduced as a result of SAPs have tended to impact negatively 
  on the economic situation, human livelihood conditions, human vulnerability 
  and coping capacities in Africa, but at different scales, and with considerable 
  differentiation between countries, affected sectors and populations. The WCED 
  noted in 1987 that: 'most of the world's poorest countries depend for increasing 
  export earnings on tropical agricultural products that are vulnerable to fluctuating 
  or declining terms of trade. Expansion can often be achieved at the price of 
  ecological stress' (WCED 1987). In Southern Africa, for example, SAPs have resulted 
  in major job losses in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, increasing 
  poverty levels and pressure on the environment (Chenje 2000). Overall, people 
  in these countries have become more vulnerable, both socially and economically, 
  because degraded environments are producing fewer resources.</p>
<p>SAPs also increase vulnerability to disaster in urban areas which are not necessarily 
  disaster-prone by nature. The SAPs contribute to accelerated urbanization, population 
  movement and population concentration, which make low-income urban dwellers 
  more vulnerable to the impacts of disasters (Hamza and Zetter 1998). Liberalization 
  of pricing systems and intensified exports have translated into forest losses 
  in Côte d'Ivoire, where rising cocoa production has been the primary source 
  of decreased forest cover-which has been reduced from 12 million ha in 1960 
  to 3.9 million ha at present. Similarly, in Cameroon, the IMF encouraged the 
  government to reduce export taxes on forest products, to devalue the local currency 
  and to cut government jobs. The lack of financial resources and personnel to 
  enforce forest protection, combined with few incentives for appropriate forest 
  management and land use, resulted in a 49.6 per cent increase in lumber exports 
  between 1995 and 1997, and the wholesale destruction of one of Cameroon's most 
  valuable environmental resources (FOE 2000).</p>
