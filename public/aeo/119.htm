<h3>POLLUTION OF CENTRAL AFRICA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT </h3>
<p>Marine pollution is a cause for concern in Central Africa, especially in the 
  Gulf of Guinea extending from Guinea- Bissau in Western Africa to Gabon, and 
  in the nearshore waters of oil-producing states. Sources of pollution include 
  offshore oil exploration, coastal industries and oil refinery activities, urban 
  solid wastes and sewage from coastal towns, and illegal activities including 
  dumping of wastes at sea. Marine pollution disturbs habitats, disrupts functioning 
  of ecosystems and causes loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>The significant oil reserves off the coast of Gabon have been exploited and 
  have contributed to the country's economic growth. But they have also contributed 
  to the risk of pollution by oil and hydrocarbons from spills, leaking valves, 
  corroded pipelines, ballast water discharges, and productionwater effluents 
  (Chidi Ibe 1996). Diesel and other toxic chemicals are present in drilling fluids, 
  adding to the burden of pollution from oil exploration and exploitation. Heavy 
  metals are also associated with oil extraction. These are both toxic to marine 
  life and, because they accumulate in the food chain, ultimately pose a threat 
  to human health through consumption of fish and seafood (Chidi Ibe 1996). Tar 
  balls have appeared on the beaches of Pointe Noir, the economic capital of Congo, 
  and residents of the coastal zone have complained of pollution and an oily aftertaste 
  in locallycaught fish (Pabou-M'Baki 1999).</p>
<p>Domestic sewage and agricultural effluents are additional significant sources 
  of marine pollution. This form of pollution arises because the rates of urban 
  and industrial development in the coastal zone exceed the capacity of municipal 
  wastewater treatment facilities. In some cities along the coast of the Gulf 
  of Guinea, less than 2 per cent of households have water supply and sanitation 
  (UNIDO 2000).</p>

<h4><a name="img2c10"></a>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality in 
  Central Africa</h4>
The Gulf of Guinea Large Marine Ecosystem Programme has been successful in establishing 
regional effluent regulations and standards, and an industrial waste management 
programme has been piloted. Cameroon has been an active participant in the programme, 
establishing a National Steering Committee and adopting a regional Integrated 
Coastal Area Management Programme that lays the foundations of environmental policy. 
A waste management programme will also be implemented in Cameroon in the near 
future (UNIDO 2000). Additional measures to combat marine pollution in the sub-region 
include signing and ratification by Central African countries of the 1976 MARPOL 
Convention on preventing dumping of wastes at sea, and the Montego Bay Convention 
on the Law of the Sea. 
<p>The Abidjan Convention, to which all coastal Central African countries are 
  party, calls for cooperation in combating pollution in cases of emergency through 
  early warning of emergencies, and cooperation in clean up, as well as mitigation 
  activities. As a follow up to signing of the Convention, a Regional Workshop 
  on Oil Spill Preparedness, Response and Cooperation for West and Central Africa 
  was held in Luanda, Angola, in November 2000. The focus of this was to generate 
  and facilitate communication and links within the WACAF region. A series of 
  conclusions and recommendations were drawn up at the workshop focusing on improving 
  national and regional cooperation (IPIECA 2000).</p>
<h5>Towards ICZM in Central Africa</h5>
<p>Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and 
  Sao Tome and Principe are all members of the UNEP Regional Seas Programme for 
  West and Central Africa, and are party to the Abidjan Convention. Although this 
  has facilitated the development of ICZM policies and programmes at the national 
  level, many countries have nevertheless experienced slow progress. The institutional 
  structures and capacity for effective coordination and holistic integration 
  of marine and coastal ecosystem issues into development planning and environmental 
  management remain weak. Political commitment and financial resources also need 
  to be augmented. Programmes to raise awareness among the public and among other 
  stakeholders have also been initiated, but funds, staff and equipment are required 
  to implement regulations and environmental protection activities.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme involves the Central African 
  countries of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic 
  of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe. The aim of 
  this programme is to reduce poverty in coastal and inland fishing communities. 
  It is heavily dependent on the participation of communities and sharing of benefits 
  among the 7 million people whose livelihoods depend directly on the use of marine 
  and freshwater resources. Communities will be involved in environmental and 
  economic assessments, and the programme will include extensive public awareness 
  activities to improve communication and cooperation on sustainable development 
  (FAO 1999).</p>
