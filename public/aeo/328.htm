<h2>PROPOSALS FOR ACTION </h2>
<p>A key aim of the AEO process has been to identify 'achievable action items' 
  for recommendation to policy officials, and to AMCEN as Africa's environmental 
  body. Urgent actions necessary to reverse the current trends in environmental 
  degradation in Africa have been derived from the recommendations and analyses 
  presented in the preceding chapters of this report. These actions are detailed 
  below in the form of a 31-point list. They are summarized in a matrix presented 
  in <a href="335.htm">Annex 3</a>. Actions are grouped in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reducing poverty;</li>
  <li>arresting environmental degradation directly; and</li>
  <li>promoting cross-cutting actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of the recommended actions is principally the responsibility 
  of African governments, with technical assistance from AMCEN and sub-regional 
  organizations. In turn, African governments, AMCEN and the sub-regional organizations 
  may enter into partnerships with sub-regional, national and international organizations, 
  to further facilitate implementation.</p>
<h3>REDUCING POVERTY</h3>
<p>Poverty is a complex multidimensional problem. In Africa, poverty is one of 
  the drivers of environmental degradation, largely because the poor have limited 
  choices and depend heavily on the natural resource base. There is no uniform 
  solution to the problem of poverty. Country-specific programmes to tackle poverty, 
  and sub-regional, regional and international efforts supporting national efforts, 
  are needed. At national level, a specific anti-poverty strategy is, therefore, 
  one of the basic conditions for ensuring sustainable development. Many African 
  countries have prepared and are implementing poverty reduction strategies and 
  plans.</p>
<p>Actions which are directly relevant to the environment, and which are imperative 
  if Africa is to reduce poverty, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Endorsement and promotion of the principles of sustainable development<br>
    </b>The African Union in general and, where the environment is concerned, 
    AMCEN in particular, need to persuade the global community to adopt the <i>New 
    African Initiative</i>-a recovery plan in the <i>New Partnership for Africa's 
    Development</i> (NEPAD)-as the framework for sustainable development in Africa, 
    and to accelerate setting up of the necessary mechanisms of the World Solidarity 
    Fund (WSF). National governments also need to increase efforts towards attaining 
    the poverty reduction goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
    December 2000. In the Declaration, world leaders agree among other things, 
    to set specific targets to halve the proportion of people who live in extreme 
    poverty, and to reach development goals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Acceleration of industrial development </b><br>
    Acceleration of industrial development is necessary to provide employment 
    and to raise the financial resources needed to stimulate economic growth. 
    In this respect, regional cooperation is required in order to raise the industrial 
    productivity and competitiveness of African states to international levels. 
    National efforts should also be devoted to promoting the development of micro-, 
    small- and medium-sized enterprises. The focus should be on agricultural commodities 
    and natural resources, in order to add value to Africa's traditional exports. 
    However, any national industrialization strategy must be environmentally sustainable 
    and must not be a contributor to further environmental degradation.</li>
</ul>

    </table>
    <b><a name="img57"></a>Increase of sustainable agricultural production </b><br>
    National governments must increase financing for the agricultural sector. 
    Regional and international support is needed for implementation of the UNCCD. 
    Similarly, regional and international support is needed to persuade the developed 
    countries to remove agricultural subsidies which are currently blocking entry 
    of African agricultural products into their markets, and which are encouraging 
    the dumping of products onto the African market. Regional support is needed 
    to convince the developed countries to apply the precautionary principle to 
    genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which have unknown, but potentially 
    dangerous, consequences for agricultural production in Africa. African governments 
    should also promote sustainable agricultural production techniques to avoid 
    the adverse impacts of the sector on the environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of human health, well-being and development </b><br>
    African governments must ensure greater access to affordable primary and secondary 
    health care and medical technology. They also need to improve environmental 
    and social conditions, which are responsible for spreading diseases, and to 
    build the capacity of local communities to improve their living conditions. 
    International partnership is required to make both preventive and curative 
    health care available. Regional and sub-regional technical assistance and 
    national efforts are needed to provide access to medicine at affordable prices, 
    while promoting public health and nutrition. National governments need to 
    empower African women in social and economic development, and to strengthen 
    the skills of the region's youth. Regional and sub-regional technical assistance 
    is also required to complement national efforts in promoting human-resource 
    development and capacity building, including universal primary and secondary 
    education.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Advocacy for better terms of trade <br>
    </b>Regional lobbying is needed to support the efforts of African governments 
    in persuading developed countries to open up their markets, and to eliminate 
    subsidies on agriculture, textiles and other export products competing with 
    those of the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Generation of increased domestic financing for sustainable development 
    </b><br>
    Efforts are required at all levels-national, subregional, regional and international-to 
    promote foreign direct investment in Africa. The developed countries and the 
    Bretton Woods institutions should cancel Africa's external debt. Efforts should 
    also be intensified to persuade developed countries to adhere to the United 
    Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for ODA, and to ensure that Africa gets 
    its fair share. New partnerships with UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank are needed 
    to increase the resources available, and to improve on operational and project 
    implementation procedures of the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improvement of infrastructure and sustainable human settlement patterns 
    in Africa </b><br>
    Improvements are needed in infrastructure and sustainable human settlement 
    patterns in Africa, in order to reduce congestion and pollution. National 
    governments need to improve access to, and the affordability and reliability 
    of, infrastructural services. African governments need the support of AMCEN 
    in mobilizing external resources for implementation of the Habitat Agenda 
    and the declaration of the 25th United Nations Special Session, to achieve 
    sustainable human settlements in Africa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improvement of the scientific and technological base in Africa </b><br>
    AMCEN needs to identify scientific and technological gaps, particularly relating 
    to environmental management, and should guide African governments in accessing 
    appropriate indigenous and external technologies in order to enhance environmental 
    management and economic development.</li>
