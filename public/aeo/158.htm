<h3>WATER QUALITY IN EASTERN AFRICA</h3>

<p><a name="img2e4"></a>A further environmental issue concerning the freshwater 
  resources of eastern Africa is pollution from domestic, agricultural and industrial 
  sources. Low levels of water supply and sanitation, and overburdening of municipal 
  services, create situations where untreated sewage is discharged directly into 
  watercourses, particularly in areas surrounding informal settlements. For example, 
  in Mombasa, the domestic sewerage system was designed to serve about 17 per 
  cent of the current population. The outfalls for both domestic sewage and stormwater 
  run-off are located in the Kilindini and Tudor Creeks, and sludges from septic 
  tanks and pit latrines are usually disposed of at the Kibarani dumpsite on the 
  shores of Makupa Creek (UNEP 1998). </p>
<p>Poor agricultural practices contribute to the pollution of freshwater sources 
  in two ways. Firstly, the increasing use of agrochemicals contributes to the 
  pollution of both surface water and groundwater, through run-off. These chemicals 
  either cause eutrophication (by increasing the nitrogen and phosphorous loads 
  in water bodies), or are toxic to flora and fauna. Unsustainable farming practices 
  and overgrazing increase the susceptibility of the soil to erosion. Increased 
  sediment loads in rivers, in turn, contribute to siltation in dams and lakes, 
  and the smothering of habitats, flora and fauna. Lake Victoria, for example, 
  has become the recipient of increased concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous, 
  washed down from the surrounding plantations of tea and coffee. This has led 
  to the invasion and rapid domination of the water hyacinth, <i>Eichornia crassipes</i>, 
  which has formed dense mats, blocking navigation channels and choking boat engines. 
  Other adverse impacts of the weed include modification of aquatic and wetland 
  environments, through changing the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved 
  oxygen, as well as reducing the light penetrating below the surface of the lake 
  and releasing toxins. It also reduces the quality of water for drinking and 
  domestic use, and provides an ideal habitat for disease carriers, such as mosquitoes. 
  The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Programme is implementing biological, 
  chemical and mechanical means of controlling the spread of the weed, and the 
  Kisumu Innovation Centre-Kenya (KICK) has initiated marketing a number of crafts 
  made from the weed (Olal, Muchilwa and Woomer 2001).</p>

<p>In 2001 Lake Nakuru and Lake Bogoria in Kenya experienced large numbers of 
  deaths among the flamingos for which the lakes are famous. Pollution by heavy 
  metals is suspected to be the primary cause of these deaths, resulting from 
  contamination of the lakes by sewage, industrial effluent and organochlorines, 
  which are present in agricultural run off (Environment News Service 2001). Industrial 
  developments, particularly in urban centres and along the coast, have inadequate 
  or expensive wastewater treatment facilities and, therefore, discharge of effluents 
  directly into rivers and estuaries is common. The growing level of industrialization 
  in greater Mombasa, for example, is causing considerable concern as a result 
  of effluent discharge. Complex organic compounds and heavy metals may be contained 
  in effluents and spillages from commercial industries and textile mills, which 
  are located along the coast and banks of the Mombasa, Kilindini, and Port Reitz 
  creeks (Mwangi and Munga 1997). A decline in the quality of freshwater creates 
  even greater stress for water supply schemes. It can also limit industrial, 
  domestic and agricultural water use, and it contributes to the prevalence of 
  waterborne diseases.</p>
<h4>Improving water quality in Eastern Africa</h4>
<p>Responses aimed at improving water quality and at mitigating the environmental 
  impacts of poor quality water include the promulgation by several countries 
  in East Africa of water quality standards and effluent controls. A Water Action 
  Plan, providing a framework for the protection and development of Uganda's water 
  resources, was prepared in 1994, based on the guiding principles of IWRM established 
  at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. 
  Uganda's Water Statute, incorporating many of the recommendations from the Water 
  Action Plan, was promulgated in 1995, and regulations for the control of Water 
  Resources, Water and Sewerage and Wastewater Discharges were issued in 1998. 
  A draft National Water Policy is currently being reviewed prior to submission 
  to The Ugandan government for approval (NEMA 1999). Wetland rehabilitation is 
  also underway, in order to improve water quality and ecological functionality 
  (See <a href="#box2e6">Box 2e.6</a>).</p>

            <p>Wetlands in Kampala are used by the city council as dumping sites 
              for municipal waste. The associated pollution has rendered these 
              areas unsuitable for wildlife or human settlement. Resultant flooding 
              in the city has led to: the interruption of transport and communications 
              services; loss of property; and outbreaks of waterborne diseases. 
              Kampala is also experiencing increasing numbers of problematic Marabou 
              storks. These birds are wetland species, which have been forced 
              into the city as scavengers, due to the loss of their natural habitat. 
              The storks live on the top of buildings, and constantly dirty the 
              city's streets and roads.</p>
            <p>Education and improved town planning are recommended as solutions 
              to the growing problems of wetland destruction and its consequences, 
              together with improved wetland protection and management. Additional 
              measures include the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International 
              Importance, and cooperation in environmental pollution control under 
              the auspices of IGAD.</p>

<p>Ethiopia's water supply and sanitation sector shows an encouraging participation 
  of communities, for example, through the contribution of beneficiary communities 
  in the development and construction of water supply schemes and sanitation facilities 
  (WHO/UNICEF 2000). Under the Africa 2000 initiative, launched in 1996, a study 
  on low-cost latrine technology options was carried out in 1997, and a study 
  on the impact of water and sanitation-related diseases on development is also 
  nearly complete. Several health education trainers have completed their training 
  and are being deployed.</p>
<p>Kenya's government has formulated a comprehensive water supply, demand and 
  management policy, which was approved by the government in 2001. The policy 
  outlines methods to improve water supply, methods for regulation, pricing and 
  ways to enlist the participation of other stakeholders.</p>
