<h3>COASTAL EROSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS </h3>
<p>The coastlines of all the Western Indian Ocean Islands are threatened by erosion. 
  Coastal erosion and destruction of natural habitats such as mangroves and coral 
  reefs in many parts of the sub-region are the major threats to sustainable use 
  of resources and development in the coastal zone. Erosion is primarily a result 
  of uncoordinated and inappropriate developments in the coastal zone, due to 
  rapid population growth and development of the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Mining of sand, coral, limestone and shells is depleting the buffer zone provided 
  by the coral reefs and, as a result, the shores are more exposed to wave action, 
  storm surges, and inundation. For example, in Mauritius a million tonnes of 
  coral sand are excavated every year, by hand, and transported with dugout canoes 
  (Bigot, Charpy, Maharavo, Abdou Rabi, Paupiah, Aumeeruddy, Villedieu & Lieutaud 
  2000). Sand mining also has noticeable impacts in Comoros and is creating major 
  problems in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Fishermen using dynamite, walking on the coral reef and using nets out of season 
  contribute to a level of coral destruction that is out-pacing the coral's natural 
  capacity for regeneration. The situation is fragile and political commitment 
  is needed to ensure that action is taken to arrest the decline in quality of 
  the coral reefs, to restore the damage done, and to establish effective monitoring 
  systems.</p>
<p>One of the most serious impacts of coastal erosion is increased vulnerability 
  to the rise in sea level that will result from global climate change. The IPCC 
  predicts an average sea level rise of up to one metre by the year 2100 (IPCC 
  2001a). In the Western Indian Ocean Islands, this would flood natural habitats 
  such as mangroves, and contaminate habitats further inland with saltwater, changing 
  the ecological conditions and biological composition. Precious groundwater resources 
  may also be lost through saltwater intrusion.</p>
<p>In Seychelles, a one-metre sea level rise would submerge many of the islands 
  and result in a loss of 70 per cent of the land area (Shah 1995, Shah 1996). 
  Mauritius is estimated to fare better, losing less than one per cent of its 
  land. (IPCC 1995). This would, nevertheless displace around 3 000 people and 
  even small losses of beach area could have detrimental impacts on tourism and 
  fisheries activities.</p>
<p>Global climate change also brings a threat of change in sea temperature and 
  increasing frequency and intensity of cyclones or tropical storms. In 1998, 
  the coral reefs of the Western Indian Ocean were subjected to intensive bleaching 
  from an El Niño-induced sea temperature rise and up to 30 per cent of the coral 
  in Comoros and 80 per cent in Seychelles were killed (PRE/COI 1998). Initial 
  assessments of the economic costs of this coral bleaching were between US$700 
  million and US$8 000 million (Wilkinson, Linden, Cesar, Hodgson, Rubens & Strong 
  1999), although recovery has been observed in Mauritius and Rodrigues.</p>
<p>Loss of habitat and food supply has caused depletion of fish populations dependent 
  on coral throughout the sub-region and this may reduce the aesthetic quality 
  of the environment essential for development of sustainable tourism. In addition, 
  the decrease in income from fishing and the loss of fish in local diet may affect 
  human health (UNEP 1999a).</p>
<h4>Mitigation of effects of climate change in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>In view of the predicted sea temperature rises which will become more common 
  as global temperatures increase, mitigation efforts to protect coral reefs must 
  include reductions in GHG emissions (Reaser, Pomerance & Thomas 2000). All of 
  the Western Indian Ocean countries have signed the UNFCCC and Seychelles has 
  signed the Kyoto Protocol. However, these countries contribute negligible amounts 
  to global GHG emissions and it is therefore important that major GHG contributors 
  be held to their commitments if the world's coral reefs are to be protected.</p>
<p>Another key component for protection against future damage to reefs is monitoring 
  and improved understanding of the ecological system and of natural and human 
  influences on it. Sea level changes are being monitored carefully in the sub-region, 
  and Madagascar and Mauritius have set up Cells for Monitoring and Analysis of 
  Sea level (CMAS), as part of the IOC-UNEPWMO pilot project on sea level changes 
  and associated coastal impacts. These cells will cooperate with others in the 
  Western Indian Ocean (from Bangladesh to Kenya), sharing data and identifying 
  common problems. The ultimate aim is to develop a framework for data collection 
  and analysis which will provide understanding of variability and allow assessment 
  of trends (Sheyte 1994). Information and recommendations should be integrated 
  into regional and sectoral development policies and action plans (CSD 1999).</p>
