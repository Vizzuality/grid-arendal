<h3>COMBATING DESERTIFICATION </h3>
<p>The region has been in the forefront in terms of pushing for an international 
  response to drought and desertification. The result was the adoption and ratification 
  of the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD). Since the CCD came into effect 
  in 1996, countries (see <a href="#box316">Box 3.16</a> on the example of Mauritania) 
  and sub-regions have adopted action programmes to combat desertification. In 
  Southern Africa, for example, where general overdependence on natural resources 
  has been identified as the root cause of desertification, the action programme 
  involves strengthening environmental capacities, enhancing public awareness 
  and mobilizing their active participation in combating desertification, land 
  degradation and the effects of drought (SADC-ELMS 1997). <a href="#fig32">Figure 
  3.2</a> illustrates the main causes of desertification.</p>

            <p>In parts of Mauritania, villagers face two major environmental 
              hazards: encroaching sand dunes which take over and destroy vegetation, 
              causing desertification; and lack of water for household consumption 
              and irrigation for agricultural production. Both situations render 
              populations vulnerable by increasing poverty, and leading to food 
              security and health problems, and they can cause civil unrest and 
              strife.</p>
            <p>The government has adopted policy measures to address the situation 
              through the Mauritania-Agricultural Rehabilitation Programme, supported 
              by external funding from the International Fund for Agricultural 
              Development (IFAD), and these are yielding good results. Sand dunes, 
              which are engulfing planted areas and which are threatening to engulf 
              villages, are being brought under control in order to reduce environmental 
              impacts and to make the population more secure.</p>
            <p>The acute problem of water availability for household needs and 
              agricultural irrigation is also being solved within the same project.Wells 
              are being sunk where water is available in order to satisfy household 
              and irrigation needs, and water is also being pumped from the Senegal 
              River for irrigation. The implementation of the policy is helping 
              to alleviate poverty, and to improve the food security problem and 
              health of the population, thus increasing their coping capacities.</p>

<h3>POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p>Countries throughout the region have adopted various initiatives and programmes 
  to alleviate poverty. As already highlighted, poverty is a major factor in increased 
  human vulnerability to a stressed environment. Many national, regional and international 
  organizations are involved in poverty alleviation programmes in Africa. For 
  example, the African Development Bank (ADB) has developed a five-year programme 
  which makes poverty alleviation and lasting development in Africa priority issues. 
  The ADB's objective is to reduce poverty by half by 2015. According to ADB statistics, 
  40-45 per cent of the region's population live in absolute poverty, and 30 per 
  cent are classified as extremely poor, including 70 per cent of women. The ADB 
  will focus action on several major areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>agricultural and rural development, since the majority of the people in 
    Africa live in rural areas; </li>
  <li>human capital development, through addressing health and education problems; 
  </li>
  <li> 'transversal sectors', which include the environment, gender equality and 
    governance; </li>
  <li>regional integration, which the bank emphasizes as the only means to secure 
    African integration in the world economy and among other groupings; and </li>
  <li>the promotion of the private sector as an engine of growth, job creation 
    and exports. (Kabbaj 2000).</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, African environment ministers issued a statement, following an October 
  2001 African Preparatory Conference for the World Summit on Sustainable Development. 
  In the statement, poverty eradication was identified as a priority area for 
  action (see <a href="#box317">Box 3.17</a>).</p>

            <p>Although Africa is an indispensable resource base which has been 
              serving humanity for many centuries, poverty in Africa stands in 
              stark contrast to the prosperity of the developed world. The process 
              of globalization has further marginalized Africa, and this has contributed 
              to the increasing incidence of poverty in the region. It is in this 
              regard that the New African Initiative calls for the reversal of 
              this abnormal situation by changing the relationship which underpins 
              it. Achieving the poverty reduction goals of the Millennium Declaration 
              is a joint responsibility of the North and South. It requires the 
              adoption of a comprehensive approach which addresses the key priority 
              areas, including: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>the removal of obstacles which prevent access to exports from 
                developing countries to the markets of developed countries; </li>
              <li>debt reduction/cancellation; </li>
              <li>a review of the conditionalities of the IMF and the WB; </li>
              <li>promoting industrial growth, especially through small- and medium-sized 
                enterprises; </li>
              <li>ensuring access to sources of energy at affordable prices, particularly 
                in rural areas; </li>
              <li>promoting micro-finance; </li>
              <li>enhancing access to basic health services; </li>
              <li>sustainable rural development; </li>
              <li>agricultural development and food security; </li>
              <li>greater access to safe water and sanitation; </li>
              <li>reducing the vulnerability of our people to natural disasters 
                and environmental risks; and </li>
              <li>access to and improved standards of education at all levels.
