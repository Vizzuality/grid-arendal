<h3>ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION DIRECTLY </h3>
<p>The environment is the basis of human health, wealth, well-being and security. 
  The majority of Africans derive livelihoods directly from the natural resources 
  of the environment. Humankind in general has also benefited significantly from 
  Africa's natural resources, and from environmental services, such as carbon 
  sequestration. However, deterioration of the environment in many parts of Africa 
  over the past three decades has left millions of people more vulnerable to adverse 
  environmental change than before. The African countries affected need to halt 
  and, where possible, even reverse the current trend in environmental degradation.</p>
<p>If environmental degradation in Africa is to be halted and reversed, the following 
  actions are imperative for the region.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="right" width="300">

    <b><a name="img58"></a>Reduction and halting of activities that lead to land 
    degradation</b><br>
    Efforts at national and sub-regional levels should be focused on promoting 
    campaigns of environmental information, education and communication. African 
    governments, for their part, need to ensure that they are in a position to 
    implement the UNCCD in a timely and effective manner and, together with AMCEN, 
    they need to ensure that the UNCCD is acknowledged as a sustainable development 
    convention. National governments (with technical help from AMCEN if necessary) 
    and sub-regional organizations should prepare sound land use policies and 
    plans, where these do not exist. National governments also need to improve 
    systems that address gender considerations, where these, too, are lacking. 
    They also need to put in place mechanisms to protect Africa's cultural and 
    historical heritage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Conservation and sustainable management of Africa's rich biodiversity</b> 
    <br>
    The current 'ecosystem approach' to biodiversity conservation is too narrow. 
    More comprehensive regional, sub-regional and national efforts are needed 
    to promote both an ecosystems and landscape approach, with an emphasis on 
    sustainable development in a wider context Similarly, African governments-with 
    the technical assistance of AMCEN and sub-regional organizations, where necessary-need 
    to develop and implement national legislation for the protection of the rights 
    of local communities, farmers and breeders, and for the regulation of access 
    to biological resources and biosafety, in line with the OAU Model Law. Subregional 
    groupings and national governments must also endeavour to rehabilitate degraded 
    wetland areas. AMCEN's technical assistance will also be required to strengthen 
    the Lusaka Agreement, in order to facilitate implementation of the provisions 
    of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and 
    to safeguard the conservation of eastern and southern African wildlife. Where 
    there has been extensive poaching in wildlife protected areas, the relevant 
    sub-regional organizations and national governments should carry out rehabilitation 
    work through species re-introduction and habitat restoration. National governments, 
    with the technical assistance of AMCEN, should document and disseminate indigenous 
    knowledge and practices that are applicable to conservation. Given that Africa's 
    biodiversity is not fully understood, regional groupings and national governments 
    should, with international assistance, make biodiversity inventories and document 
    significant landraces (types of seeds used in traditional agriculture). National 
    governments should promote the establishment of ex-situ conservation facilities 
    for rare, vulnerable and endangered species. They should also, through sub-regional, 
    regional and international partnerships, promote the conservation of agricultural 
    biodiversity, the backbone of rural livelihoods and the engine of economic 
    growth in many parts of the Africa region. Such efforts should include the 
    promotion of <i>in-situ</i> conservation of landraces of important agricultural 
    crops.</li>

    <b><a name="img59"></a>Reduction of high rates of deforestation in parts of 
    Africa</b><br>
    National governments need to devote and access additional financial resources 
    and technology to implement the provisions of the International Panel on Forests 
    (IPF)/International Forest Forum (IFF) of the United Nations Forum on Forests 
    (UNFF). Similarly, African governments need to promote access to affordable 
    energy for sustainable development, especially in rural areas. They should 
    also promote research on and development of clean energy technologies, efficiency 
    of energy supply and usage, and efficient uptake of renewable resources. The 
    West Indian Ocean Island States of Africa need to revitalize the Barbados 
    Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing 
    States. AMCEN should, through technical assistance, contribute to strengthening 
    of the operations of the African Timber Organization (ATO), and should support 
    the Yaounde Declaration. National governments should promote collaboration 
    in forest management between forestry authorities and local communities. They 
    should also review the pricing of forest products to reflect their true economic 
    value, in order to provide better earnings, discourage wasteful exploitation 
    and promote more efficient utilization of non-wood forest products. African 
    governments need to rehabilitate degraded forest areas. They also need to 
    attract private sector investment to forestry. AMCEN needs to guide African 
    states in researching and documenting the medicinal values of their forests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mitigation of the adverse impacts of climate change and other atmospheric 
    conditions </b><br>
    AMCEN should be an advocate for finalization of the Kyoto Protocol. African 
    governments need to lobby the global community to operationalize the Climate 
    Change Fund (CCF) for developing countries, as well as the Special Fund for 
    least developed countries. Similar assistance is required to facilitate African 
    countries' access to the adoption of cleaner technologies, in order to reduce 
    industrial emissions. Africa needs combined efforts at regional, sub-regional 
    and national levels to establish climate modelling programmes and early warning 
    of rainfall variations. African governments also need to: ratify the United 
    Nations Motor Vehicle Emissions Agreement; improve enforcement of emission 
    standards and regulations; and promote the use of unleaded gasoline. The latter 
    would be an expensive option for Africa, but it has environmental benefits 
    and, therefore, a positive cost-benefit ratio. AMCEN should facilitate the 
    north-south exchange of experience and knowledge between experts and provide 
    for the transfer of know-how between African countries. IGAD countries, with 
    technical assistance from AMCEN, should support and make operational the Strategy 
    for the Elimination of Hunger in the Horn of Africa, an area experiencing 
    extreme levels of rainfall variation, in terms of both amount and frequency. 
    Through partnerships at international, regional and sub-regional levels, African 
    states need to improve their understanding of the likely social impacts of 
    atmospheric pollution and to quantify them.</li>

    <a name="img510"></a><b>Improvement of waste management practices </b><br>
    Partnerships are required to put in place the funding and capacity required 
    for effective management of non-hazardous wastes. AMCEN should make recommendations 
    to counter the export of obsolete capital goods and equipment to Africa. Through 
    partnerships at international, regional and subregional levels, African governments 
    should implement the various conventions governing the generation, storage, 
    transport, and transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes, including 
    radioactive wastes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Promotion of environmentally sound management of chemical products </b><br>
    African states need to establish partnerships to support the management of 
    chemical products, in accordance with Chapter 19 of Agenda 21, and the Rotterdam 
    and Stockholm conventions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improvement of access to and quality of freshwater resources </b><br>
    Recognizing the limited financial resources at their disposal, African governments 
    need to promote public-private partnerships in water resource management. 
    They also need to: develop appropriate standards for water quality; promote 
    the use of economic instruments (incentives and disincentives) for water resource 
    management, including the application of the polluter pays principle; and 
    introduce appropriate water pricing policies and mechanisms. International 
    partnerships, such as the Nile Basin Initiative, are required to support regional 
    and sub-regional water resource management bodies. National governments, with 
    the assistance of sub-regional organizations, should inventory important water 
    catchments and develop guidelines for their sustainable utilization. They 
    should also promote integrated water resource management and development as 
    a standard practice. African governments, through sub-regional and international 
    support, should improve general access to freshwater resources. AMCEN should 
    promote the popularization of environmentallysound, low-cost technologies 
    for water harvesting. African governments should also address water quality 
    issues. In particular, where necessary, they need to establish, and subsequently 
    enforce, national effluent discharge regulations and standards. They should 
    also increase investments in sewerage management, in order to improve freshwater 
    quality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Improvement of living conditions in urban areas <br>
    </b>African governments need to plan urban development appropriately for sustainable 
    development. Furthermore, they need to formulate appropriate human settlement 
    and waste management policies, laws and regulations, and to promote private 
    sector participation in improving urban infrastructure and the provision of 
    municipal services. African governments should also fulfil their national 
    obligations under the Habitat Agenda, and should prepare integrated water 
    and waste management strategies and action plans.</li>
