<h4><i>Marine and coastal environment</i></h4>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa</i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, flexible laws allow for the involvement of new 
  economic operators in coastal areas. The pressure on coastal and marine resources 
  increases, although their exploitation has real economic impacts.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>The Policy Reform scenario redirects the focus in this sub-region regarding 
  the issue of marine pollution. The countries of Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and 
  Eritrea develop stringent pollution control regulations in order to deal with 
  effluent discharge and agricultural run-offs. The cost towns are obliged to 
  put in place pretreatment facilities for industrial and domestic sewers.</p>
<p>International laws concerning territorial rights in the sea are enforced, in 
  order to eliminate piracy and illegal fishing. Marine productivity gradually 
  increases, making it the top contributor to the GDP of the four countries of 
  this sub-region.</p>
<p> <i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>The success of the Policy Reform scenario in redistributing the large populations 
  of Northern Africa, such that population densities do not increase or are sometimes 
  lowered, shows its benefits on coastal areas. The countries of Northern Africa 
  take necessary measures for reducing marine pollution, by developing infrastructure 
  for treating wastewater before it is disposed of in the sea. Laws and regulation 
  are issued or revised in order to protect the coastal areas and water bodies 
  from unplanned development and the associated environmental impacts. EIAs are 
  mandatory for projects with potential impact on coastal and marine resources. 
  Field inspection by specialized government agencies ensures that such projects 
  follow the mitigation measures proposed in their EIAs. Many new coastal areas 
  and inland water bodies are declared as protectorates, with emphasis on the 
  ecosystem in the Red Sea.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Policy Reform scenario, the notoriety about Western African beaches 
  being used for dumping wastes is now a thing of the past. With increased sanitation, 
  and proper rubbish disposal policies and programmes, the beaches have become 
  places for pleasure. Massive tourist enterprises, interspersed with coastal 
  and marine industries, can be seen along the coast. International conventions 
  opposed to the dumping of hazardous wastes are respected.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands</i></p>
<p>Erosion protection schemes reduce overall levels of loss of coastline from 
  natural processes, but littoral urban development and ever-expanding tourism 
  affect the natural terrain and its ecology. Reestablishing in-shore fishing 
  proves more protracted than envisaged, because of continual infringement of 
  closed season rules, and the use of fine nets for coastal fishing in small boats. 
  Deep-sea protection arrangements prove satisfactory, but the sub-region is slow 
  to respond to opportunities, with continual haggling over the internal division 
  of territory, and the sharing of protection and development costs.</p>
