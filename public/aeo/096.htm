<h3>HARVESTING OF COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES </h3>
<p>Marine and coastal fishery resources are extremely important in Africa, both 
  to national economies and to the livelihoods of local communities. In the late 
  1990s, fishing contributed over 5 per cent to GDP in Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, 
  Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, and Seychelles, and the shrimp fishery 
  on the Sofala Bank in Mozambique contributed 40 per cent of Mozambique's foreign 
  exchange (FAO 1997). From 1973 to 1990, fish supplied an average 20 per cent 
  of the animal-protein intake of the population in sub- Saharan Africa (FAO 1996). 
  Improvements in refrigeration and transport technologies have increased the 
  availability of fish and shellfish to inland population centres and to international 
  markets and this has pushed up prices, especially for species such as lobster 
  and prawns. Population increases, both inland and in coastal centres, have also 
  contributed to increasing demand for fish and seafood. In addition, technological 
  developments in commercial boats and nets and in fishing techniques over the 
  past 30-40 years have increased the potential volume of fish catches and contributed 
  to depletion of fish stocks (Chenje & Johnson 1996). According to the most recent 
  data from the FAO, exploitation of fish stocks increased between 1974 and 1999, 
  by which time at least 70 per cent of fish stocks worldwide were considered 
  fully or overexploited (FAO 2000). <a href="#fig2c3">Figure 2c.3</a> shows the 
  fish catch from African waters in the 1972-2002 period.</p>

<p><a name="fig2c3"></a>Certain methods of harvesting can also be destructive 
  and a cause of depletion of marine and coastal resources. For example, dynamite 
  fishing is still practised in the coastal zone of Eastern Africa where it damages 
  coral reefs and has resulted in declines in the fisheries in these areas. The 
  practice has, however, been eliminated from some protected marine areas, thanks 
  to good conservation and educational measures (WWF 2001a). Bottom trawling is 
  also a destructive method which disturbs benthic (seabed) communities and drags 
  up accumulated material such as sand, rocks, plants and non-target animal species, 
  all of which are regarded as waste and are dumped elsewhere.</p>
<p>Overfishing by foreign fleets is another significant factor in the decline 
  of African fish stocks, particularly along the west African coast. For example, 
  the European Union (EU) pays around US$234 million in subsidies for EU boats 
  to have access to Mauritanian waters (WWF 2001b). African governments originally 
  saw fishing by foreign fleets as an easy means of earning foreign exchange, 
  but overfishing has made it a serious threat which depletes fish stocks and 
  forces local smallscale fishermen to endanger their lives by fishing further 
  and further out to sea, or to fish in protected areas such as marine national 
  parks. The impacts of overharvesting of fishery resources include the suppression 
  of local livelihoods, reduced capacity to meet food requirements and reduced 
  potential for economic returns on exports. Over the past 30 years, availability 
  of fish per capita in Africa as a whole has declined and, in some countries 
  (e.g. Ghana and Liberia), the average diet contained less fish protein in the 
  1990s than it did during the 1970s (FAO 2000).</p>
<p>An outlook study over the next ten years predicts that local supplies of fish 
  may continue to decline in Africa (FAO 2000). The reasons for this include lack 
  of resources for enforcing controls on fishing in overexploited multi-species 
  fisheries, particularly those exploited by numerous companies from all over 
  the world. In addition, any aquaculture developments are likely to focus on 
  high-value products and, therefore, concentrate mainly on export markets.</p>
<h4>Sustainable harvesting of coastal and marine resources</h4>
<p>Declining catches, together with a decrease in the mean sizes of fish caught, 
  have led to calls for the protection of line fish stocks in some African countries. 
  Management measures have been introduced including minimum size limits, bag 
  limits, use of appropriate fishing gear, and closed seasons.</p>
<p>International agreements-between African countries and between African and 
  European or other international fisheries-also have an important role to play 
  in attaining sustainable harvesting of coastal and marine resources. For example, 
  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)- which came 
  into force in 1994-defines world coastal boundaries, development rights, the 
  extent of EEZs, and covers research and policing issues. Thirty-six African 
  countries have signed the Convention, and are thus obliged to protect and preserve 
  the marine environment by cooperating regionally and internationally, and to 
  adopt policies and regulations to deal with land-based sources of marine pollution. 
  Many of the provisions of the Convention are legally binding and an international 
  tribunal has been established to resolve disputes over resources in international 
  waters.</p>
<p>In spite of such agreements, African countries are still experiencing exploitation 
  of their resources by foreign fishing fleets. For example, the large stocks 
  of small pelagic (open sea) species off the north-west and south-west coasts 
  could be harvested at a low cost and could constitute an adequate replacement 
  in local African diets for the exported high-value products. Countries along 
  the Gulf of Guinea should develop joint strategies with countries in north-west 
  and south-west Africa to exploit these stocks as a source of cheap and nutritious 
  fish for local consumers. Existing regional fishery management organizations 
  would provide an institutional mechanism for coordinating national policies 
  in this area.</p>
