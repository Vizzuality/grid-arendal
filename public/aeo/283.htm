<h4><i>Freshwater</i></h4>

  Africa</i></p>
<p>As a consequence of the growing numbers of people in Africa, the availability 
  of water, both absolutely and per capita, declines overall (although accessibility 
  in urban areas increases whilst, in rural areas, it generally decreases). This 
  population increase is coupled with greater urbanization (people in urban areas 
  use more water per capita than those in rural areas), and greater demand for 
  water for agricultural and industrial development. Demand for water increases 
  across all sectors of the economy, leading to further water scarcity. There 
  is more competition and conflict over available freshwater, both between economic 
  sectors and, in some cases, between countries which share a common water source.</p>
<p>In an attempt to meet the rising demand for water, more dams are built and 
  more boreholes are established. There is a marginal increase in the proportion 
  of water that is recycled. The increased extraction of groundwater results in 
  a decline in groundwater levels. Contamination of groundwater- caused by leaching 
  of agricultural and industrial chemicals, and human and animal waste-causes 
  deterioration in groundwater quality. The area of land under irrigation increases, 
  supplied from both stored surface water and groundwater sources but, in some 
  cases, inappropriate irrigation techniques result in salinization of the soil, 
  eventually causing the land to be abandoned.</p>
<p>In the absence of sound environmental management, water pollution-generated 
  through increased industrial and agricultural activity-leads to higher incidences 
  of eutrophication and the spread of water weeds, such as water hyacinth (Eichornia 
  crassipes) and water cabbage (Pistea stratiotes). Microbial contamination also 
  increases, as does the incidence of waterborne diseases, particularly as more 
  still and stagnant water bodies are created. Reductions in land cover result 
  in more run-off, erosion and, eventually, sedimentation of rivers. </p>
