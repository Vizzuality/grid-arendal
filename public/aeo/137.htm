<h3>FOREST COVER AND QUALITY IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>It has been estimated that up to 85 per cent of the original forest cover of 
  the Western Indian Ocean Islands has been lost (WCMC 1994). There has been a 
  steady decline over several decades with deforestation between 1990 and 2000 
  of less than 1 per cent per year for most islands. Comoros is an exception with 
  deforestation rates exceeding 4 per cent per year (FAO 2001a). The major causes 
  of deforestation are clearance to make way for shifting subsistence agriculture, 
  for commercial plantations or for industry and residential areas. For example, 
  there are now extensive coconut plantations in Seychelles as well as a relatively 
  large planted forest estate of Casuarina and Albizia. Other introduced species 
  are commercially exploited (sometimes illegally) for the distillation of ylang 
  ylang perfume or for furniture making. Forest fires are a threat in some areas 
  and burning of forests to create cattle pasture can also cause deforestation. 
  The risk of fire and drought may be augmented by increasingly long dry seasons 
  resulting from climate change. Causes of forest degradation include selective 
  harvesting of wood for fuel and ornamental plant and animal collections.</p>
<p>Total fuelwood demand in the sub-region is currently estimated at 10 million 
  m<sup>3</sup>, and is projected to rise to 18 million m<sup>3</sup> over the 
  next 30 years (FAO 2001b). More sustainable production methods must be established 
  and affordable alternative energy sources must be made available if further 
  deforestation and forest degradation are to be prevented.</p>
<p>The loss of natural forest areas has precipitated the near extinction of tree 
  species such as Tatamaca, Ebony and Baobab, common 50 years ago. Loss of forest 
  has also depleted natural habitats for a wide variety of plants, insects, birds 
  and wild animals (UNEP 1999). In Madagascar, the demise of a specific group 
  of seed dispersers may have resulted in the decline of tree regeneration in 
  an entire forest ecosystem-one study concluded that regeneration of the dry 
  deciduous forest with all of the primary forest tree species in the western 
  part of the country depends on the presence of a particular species of lemur 
  (Eulemur fulvus) (Ganzhorn and others 1999). The prolific invasion by shrubs, 
  bushes and exotic species such as Chinese guava, privet, liane cerf and poivre 
  marron is also evidence of habitat degradation throughout the sub-region's forests 
  and woodlands. Soil erosion on steep slopes in areas that were previously mountainous 
  forests is now causing siltation of fresh water ecosystems, lagoons and water 
  reservoirs throughout the sub-region causing drying of watercourses. This is 
  especially prevalent in Comoros. These changes in ecosystems are contributing 
  to climate change and loss of cultural heritage, and are threatening local livelihoods 
  (UNEP 1999).</p>
<h4>Towards sustainable management and conservation of forests and woodlands in 
  the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>Madagascar has 4 per cent of the forest area in National Parks (FAO 2001a) 
  and Seychelles has the bestpreserved area of natural forest at the Morne Seychellois 
  National Park. Some forest sites in Mauritius that are heavily infested with 
  alien plants have been designated as Conservation Management Areas, and removal 
  of exotic species has been attempted. This is a lengthy, resource-intensive 
  process, requiring the continued commitment of resources to ensure that progress 
  is not reversed. Mauritius and Seychelles have also joined the Dry Zone Africa 
  process to establish criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management.</p>
<p>Other responses in the sub-region have included attempts at reforestation, 
  but these have been inadequate (UNEP 1999). For example, only 500 hectares of 
  cleared forest was reforested in the Comoros during the 1990s and many of the 
  trees planted were utilized before maturity. In Madagascar, there were attempts 
  at reforestation during the 1970s, to provide wood for fuel, crafts, and industry 
  but efforts were not sustained, and these areas have also been depleted (UNEP 
  1999). Commercial forest plantations are also limited. Seychelles has the largest 
  area of plantations, at 11 per cent of its land area; Madagascar's plantations 
  cover just 2 per cent of its land (UNEP 1999).</p>
<p>In 1998, wood production in all Western Indian Ocean Island countries was insufficient 
  to meet domestic demand and imports of wood products exceeded exports (FAO 2001a). 
  More needs to be done to protect the little remaining natural endemic forest 
  and to enforce the forest protection legislation available in all the countries 
  of the sub-region (UNEP 1999). Several international conservation organizations 
  have been active in the region, conducting research, mapping, and making biological 
  inventory studies, as well as providing baseline information for the establishment 
  of new protected areas and assisting with policy development for sustainable 
  natural resource use. These and other efforts to bring together social and economic 
  development imperatives and environmental issues need further strengthening 
  and development.</p>
