<p>Pollution and wastes are often concentrated in urban centres due to the high 
  population densities and generally higher consumption patterns relative to rural 
  areas. This presents a visible challenge for urban planners and managers in 
  selecting landfill sites so as to minimize impacts on the environment and human 
  health. Solid waste production and management and air pollution are the issues 
  of greatest concern in African towns and cities.</p>
<p>Urban centres in developing countries are experiencing high and growing levels 
  of air pollution due to their rapid rates of growth and to industrial development. 
  The major sources of air pollution are vehicle exhausts, industrial emissions, 
  and domestic use of wood, coal, paraffin or refuse for heating and cooking. 
  Lead pollution from vehicles is also causing great concern and, in some cities, 
  it combines with dust and sand or gets trapped near the ground due to temperature 
  inversions. Some cities have introduced incentives for conversion to non-leaded 
  fuels, or have encouraged the sale of newer, cleaner vehicles. In dense, informal 
  settlements, the use of traditional fuel sources contributes to rising ambient 
  levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone and suspended 
  particulate matter. Exposure to these pollutants is associated with increased 
  risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), particularly among children. These 
  conditions are compounded by inadequate affordable health care for poorer urban 
  residents. Electrification of households, promotion of low-smoke fuels, and 
  improved ventilation of houses are some of the measures that have been adopted 
  to reduce health risks.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, each person in the developing countries was generating, 
  on average, 200 kg of solid waste per year (UNCHS 2001b), but this is increasing 
  with increasingly affluent lifestyles, as well as (to a lesser extent) population 
  growth. The amount of waste generated far exceeds the capacities for waste collection, 
  treatment and disposal of most municipalities and only one-third of the waste 
  generated in African cities is disposed of via formal disposal routes (UNCHS 
  2001b). Lack of suitable landfill sites, and rapid filling of existing ones 
  is a problem experienced by many municipalities. As a result solid waste is 
  often dumped or burned formally by the municipality. In Comoros, for example, 
  domestic waste is dumped directly on the beaches (UNEP 1998), and in Kampala 
  (Uganda) the municipality has designated several wetlands as dumping grounds 
  (NEMA 1999). Inappropriate dumping of solid waste poses a threat to human health 
  through contamination of water supplies by harmful leachates; causes blockages 
  in drainage channels exacerbating the effects of flooding; and is hazardous 
  to wildlife. Burning of solid waste contributes to ambient air pollution by 
  emission of toxic fumes.</p>
<p>Lack of integrated waste management policies, inadequate funds and low access 
  to appropriate, affordable technologies, and lack of incentives for alternative 
  waste treatment and disposal have all contributed to this situation. For example, 
  in 1999, only seven of the 90 garbage trucks in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, 
  were operating, because there were insufficient funds for training of personnel 
  and equipment maintenance (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
<p>Waste recovery and recycling in Africa is limited to 2 per cent of all waste 
  generated in the region (UNCHS 2001b) due to lack of economic incentives and 
  markets for recycled materials. The most commonly recycled materials are paper, 
  textiles, glass, plastic, and metal. However, opportunities for income generation 
  through recycling in the informal sector are gaining recognition, and several 
  African cities have projects underway for waste collection, sorting, and sale 
  to commercial composting and recycling operations. Some cities have piloted 
  industrial waste recycling by, for example, using wastes and effluents for electricity 
  production. Furthermore, a large percentage of urban waste is organic matter 
  that can be used as compost for urban agricultural development (Asomani- Boateng 
  & Haight 1999).</p>
