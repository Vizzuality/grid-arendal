<h3>LAND RIGHTS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA </h3>
<p>Access to land and resources in southern Africa is perhaps the most socially 
  and politically sensitive issue, now being entangled in environmental and political 
  agendas. Minority individual tenure and state-based conservation practices were 
  imposed on land which was traditionally owned by indigenous people, and most 
  of the black populations were removed and confined to areas insufficient in 
  extent or quality to meet production requirements, as detailed in <a href="#box2f5">Box 
  2f.5</a>. Although colonial and post-colonial apartheid policies have largely 
  been replaced, or are in the process of transformation, ownership and access 
  to resources is now largely determined by economic status, with commercial farmers 
  occupying the best farmland and contributing most visibly to the economies. 
  For example, in Zimbabwe, a minority of 4 500 mainly white commercial farmers 
  control more than 33 per cent of the country's prime agricultural land.</p>

            <p>Colonial policies on land tenure and access influenced patterns 
              of land use and management in several ways in southern Africa. Shifting 
              cultivation was seen as destructive to forests, for example, and 
              legislation creating forest reserves was passed, leaving farmers 
              with little option but to intensify production from existing cultivated 
              or grazing areas. The traditional communal land tenure system was 
              perceived to be insecure and a further cause of environmental degradation 
              and, therefore, land was either leased from the state or privatized. 
              It has since been acknowledged that state or private ownership can 
              be just as harmful to the natural resource base, and extensive land 
              tenure reforms are underway, with a greater recognition of indigenous 
              rights and practices, as well as a greater appreciation of the role 
              of women in agriculture.</p>

<p>Land inequities were, until recently, most extreme in South Africa, where some 
  70 000 white farmers owned 87 per cent of the arable land, and 2 million black 
  subsistence farmers were restricted to 13 per cent of the land (Moyo 1998). 
  The imposition of state-controlled institutions significantly undermined the 
  traditional and cultural institutional structure for resource management, thereby 
  alienating the indigenous people from their cultural and governance aspirations. 
  Traditional tenure security was effectively eroded, and CBNRM came under threat. 
  Inequitable access to land underlies the food and agricultural problems facing 
  southern Africa today, and their impact on poverty. Botswana's Tribal Land Act 
  (1968) facilitated the conversion of tribal land to individual lease for residential, 
  arable or grazing purposes (DFID 1999). This has led to the expansion of commercial 
  cattle ranching, which contributes to vegetation and soil degradation, and to 
  the marginalization of traditional hunter-gatherer communities, such as the 
  Bushmen. The traditional authority of the chiefs has been replaced by a Land 
  Board and its Board Secretariat, a Technical Committee and Land Officers (DFID 
  1999). Land Rights issues in southern Africa are manifest in increasing pressure 
  on resources, land-based conflict, and pressure for rural development and land 
  reform. In Zimbabwe, the conflict over land encompasses ancestral claims, claims 
  by veterans of the independence war and gender imbalances.</p>
<p>In response, most countries of southern Africa are developing new policies, 
  through reorganization and transformation, in order to address the needs of 
  previously disadvantaged masses. A number of strategies were adopted, in order 
  to achieve the objectives of land reform, including land redistribution and 
  resettlement programmes. For example, in Zimbabwe, the government plans to acquire 
  5 million ha of the total 11.3 million ha of land belonging to the commercial 
  sector, in order to complete its resettlement programme. Following land identification 
  and planning, selected groups are to be resettled according to six different 
  models, covering mixed farming, specialized farming and ranching (Government 
  of Zimbabwe 1998). However, there have been significant delays and, of the targeted 
  160 000 families aimed for resettlement, only 60 000 had been resettled by 1988 
  (African Development Bank 1993). Other policy instruments that have been used 
  include five-year national development plans to reorganize communal areas by 
  agricultural potential. These plans presented options for sustainable and viable 
  agricultural production, in an attempt to alleviate fears of falling agricultural 
  productivity levels and economic recession.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the land reform process has attempted to provide for tenure, 
  use and access rights that are either individual or group-based, with existing 
  or new community organizations qualifying for such rights on the basis of demonstrable 
  public support. Land Rights Officers are proposed, in order to ensure the participation 
  of all stakeholders in decision making, and Land Rights Boards will arbitrate 
  in the event of disputes and will make recommendations to the Minister (DFID 
  1999). Implementation is in the early stages, however, and assessments of effectiveness 
  would currently be premature. In Mozambique, the 1998 Land Law is beginning 
  to be implemented, following an extensive public awareness and discussion programme. 
  Surveys to register land rights have commenced in certain areas, and verbal 
  testimony to tenure under customary law is sufficient to register tenure rights 
  under the new law (DFID 1999).</p>
<p>In many countries, land reform processes have been strengthened by the creation 
  of central agencies, such as government departments for land, agriculture, local 
  government and resource development. These institutions provide land, credit 
  facilities, and a range of technical and professional services.</p>
<p>The current mixture of land tenure systems allows varying degrees of access 
  to resources by women. Under the private freehold system, women have rights 
  to access land, but very few of them have the resources to purchase such land 
  on the open market. On the other hand, communal land held under the traditional 
  or customary system allows women secondary access through marriage but, as soon 
  as the marriage breaks, they lose the right to cultivate lineage land (SARDCWIDSAA 
  2000). However, through processes of land reform, liberalization and improved 
  status of women, women are slowly beginning to control a sizeable proportion 
  of rented, purchased and allocated land.</p>
