<h2>POLICY RESPONSES AND ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>The history of social, economic and environmental development presented in 
  <a href="010.htm">Chapter 1</a> demonstrates that African countries have risen 
  to the challenge of environmental degradation. They have developed a collective 
  will to address environmental and related issues, and have created institutions 
  to translate that will into concrete results. Some milestones in this process 
  are recapitulated below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 1968, African governments signed the Algiers Convention on the conservation 
    of nature and natural resources.</li>
  <li>Efforts to use and manage natural resources in a sustainable manner doubled 
    after the 1972 United Nations Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment.</li>
  <li>In 1980, under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), 
    an extraordinary summit of African heads of state and governments led to the 
    adoption of the <i>Lagos Plan of Action</i>-Africa's blueprint for economic 
    development, which helped to highlight the challenges facing the region.</li>
  <li>In 1985, African countries established the AMCEN which, over the past 15 
    years, has made concrete achievements in providing region-wide leadership, 
    awareness raising and consensus building on global and regional environmental 
    issues, and in enhancing the skills necessary for African governments to manage 
    their environment and participate in global environmental negotiations (UNEP 
    2000). In spite of these achievements, AMCEN's leaders realize that the environmental 
    challenges facing Africa are immense and are becoming increasingly complex. 
    Meeting these challenges will require more human and financial resources, 
    increased global, regional and subregional cooperation and efforts by individual 
    African states, which must be combined with a strong political will, commitment 
    and good governance (UNEP 2000).</li>
  <li>In 2001, African heads of state agreed to transform the OAU into the African 
    Union. They also agreed on the <i>New African Initiative</i>, a plan of recovery 
    forming part of the<i> New Partnership for Africa's Development</i> (NEPAD). 
    This was a milestone in the quest for a new path to sustainable development 
    (AMCEN 2001).</li>
  <li>During the 55th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (September 
    2000), African governments endorsed the six fundamental values which should 
    underpin international relations in the 21st century, namely: freedom, the 
    equality of nations, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared 
    responsibility (AMCEN 2001).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the regional and sub-regional initiatives mentioned above, there 
  have also been country level efforts, a summary of which is presented in Annex 
  1. In their efforts to address environmental degradation, African countries 
  have focused on a range of policy responses. These are examined individually 
  below. Some failures and weaknesses in their implementation are analysed in 
  <a href="334.htm">Annex 2</a>.</p>
<h3>INTRODUCTION OF MACROECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES</h3>
<p>Governments use policies to influence the structure and operation of economies, 
  with the aim of attaining goals and targets for development and economic growth. 
  To do this, they use economic, financial, legal and institutional instruments 
  to encourage or to discourage particular types of economic activities at macroeconomic 
  or sectoral levels (Mogaka and others 2001). For example, macroeconomic policies 
  are used throughout Eastern and Southern Africa to manipulate exchange rates, 
  money supply and interest rates in order to achieve economic growth, to stimulate 
  employment and investment, and to generate foreign exchange. Agricultural policies 
  in the sub-regions, on the other hand, have long made use of combinations of 
  subsidies, taxes and credit arrangements to promote the goals of food security, 
  increased export earnings and rural income generation (Mogaka and others 2001).</p>
<p>African states have endorsed poverty reduction as a priority goal, the foundation 
  of which is sound macroeconomic policies and strategies, ensuring both sustainable 
  broad-based economic growth and macroeconomic stability. They have also become 
  more outward-looking and have put in place trade liberalization policies, structural 
  reforms in agriculture, and monetary policies that aim at maintaining low inflation, 
  a stable exchange rate, lower interest rates and fully convertible currencies. 
  Collectively, these responses are aimed at making Africa a part of the global 
  village. The perceived benefit of greater globalization is the reduction of 
  poverty in Africa.</p>
<p>Food insecurity is a measure of poverty. <a href="#tab52">Table 5.2</a> shows 
  that many countries have improved their daily per capita calorie intake, although 
  some sub-Saharan countries have done the opposite. The situation is similar 
  for per capita protein and fat supply, further strengthening the argument for 
  greater attention to poverty reduction.</p>

            <p>About 40 per cent of Tanzania's land area is covered by forests 
              and woodlands.Macroeconomic reforms introduced over the past two 
              decades have impacted on these forest and woodland resources. Research 
              on this subject has led to the conclusion that deforestation in 
              Tanzania is not linked to issues of forestry alone; it is intimately 
              related to questions of public policies, and economic and social 
              forces.</p>
            <p>The effects of structural adjustment on Tanzania's forests and 
              woodlands have been particularly intense. In the late 1980s and 
              1990s, a series of economic reforms was introduced in response to 
              a series of economic crises. These reforms aimed at restoring balances 
              in the economy and at creating a basis for sustainable growth by 
              liberalizing key markets from excessive state control. The agricultural 
              sector was a major focus of these reforms. The role of the state 
              in the marketing of outputs and inputs was diminished considerably 
              with the private sector assuming an increased role. At the same 
              time, an increasingly liberalized economic environment was accompanied 
              by a devaluation of the local currency, and a considerable increase 
              in inflation rates. These and other conditions led to a decline 
              in per capita income and a rise in the cost of living, making it 
              increasingly difficult for both urban and rural dwellers to make 
              ends meet. They also had major impacts on the way in which land 
              and other natural resources were used. Examples are given below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Devaluation increased the price of imported inputs, agro-chemicals 
                and machinery. As these became more expensive, farmers reduced 
                or abandoned their use, accelerating extensive agriculture which 
                required the clearing of woodland and forest to increase production.</li>
              <li>Removal of price controls and parastatal subsidies created more 
                space for trading in crops, which translated into a greater market 
                demand for crops, and greater production. Since the private sector 
                has failed to assume many of the more extension-based roles of 
                government, many farmers remain uninformed about sustainable farming 
                practices and agricultural expansion has often occurred at the 
                expense of the environment.</li>
              <li>Falling yields, linked to poor extension and farming practices 
                and to relatively higher costs of inputs, have encouraged farmers 
                to expand production through extension, often into forests and 
                woodlands.</li>

<p><a name="img52"></a>Some macroeconomic policies have had negative effects, 
  exacerbating poverty instead of reducing it. For example, during the 1980s, 
  most of the countries of Eastern and Southern Africa faced economic stagnation, 
  declining growth, and increasing public sector and trade deficits. These worsening 
  economic conditions, and the economic stabilization and structural adjustment 
  measures introduced in the 1990s to overcome them, resulted in considerable 
  contraction of the economy, a decline in rural living standards, and a fall 
  in income and employment (Mogaka and others 2001). As is often the case, increased 
  poverty made people more reliant on natural resources to meet their daily needs 
  or to generate income, and this increased pressure led to overexploitation of 
  resources. In other words, macroeconomic policies exacerbated poverty in the 
  two sub-regions and contributed to further environmental degradation. This was 
  certainly the case in Tanzania, where structural adjustments had a negative 
  impact on the forest sector (see <a href="#box53">Box 5.3</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to macroeconomic policies, African states have introduced sectoral 
  policies aimed at stimulating output, employment and income and, hence, poverty 
  reduction. However, using economic instruments to stimulate sectors can be accompanied 
  by risks to the environment. There are incidences of this in Africa, including 
  promotion of the energy sector and urban development, with a risk of overexploitation 
  of forest resources; promotion of the agriculture, mining and infrastructure 
  sectors, leading to woodland and forest clearance; and promotion of industrial 
  and manufacturing sectors, which generate wastes and pollutants that undermine 
  environmental quality. <a href="#tab53">Table 5.3</a> illustrates sectoral economic 
  policy incentives and disincentives for sustainable forest utilization and management 
  in Zambia.</p>
<p>Economic instruments in support of agricultural policy goals are, arguably, 
  those that have had the most detrimental effect on the environment. Agriculture 
  has long been promoted as a key sector for development and growth in Africa, 
  and for pursuit of national goals of food security, rural income generation 
  and export earnings. The range of economic instruments used in support of the 
  sector is well-documented, and has mostly involved manipulating of fiscal, financial, 
  price and market mechanisms. Examples are: imposition of relatively lower tax 
  rates on agricultural land uses (Barnes and de Jager 1995); subsidies to inputs; 
  government intervention in marketing; preferential credit arrangements; relief 
  on taxes and duties; and high spending on research, extension, development and 
  marketing (Mogaka and others 2001). Use of such mechanisms has led to an artificial 
  inflation of the profitability of agriculture and has often encouraged the spread 
  of farming activities at the expense of the environment (Mogaka and others 2001).</p>

<p>Therefore, when African states introduce macroeconomic and sectoral policies 
  aimed at reducing poverty, they must take care to ensure that none of the planned 
  improvements in economic growth are at the expense of the environment. This 
  is particularly relevant as African governments embark on the modernization 
  of agriculture as a means of reducing poverty and for overall modernization 
  of their economies.</p>
<p>Apart from macroeconomic and sectoral economic policies, social policies can 
  also have significant consequences for environmental management. For example, 
  the underlying cause of much of Africa's widespread poverty is the high rate 
  of population growth, and it is poverty that forces people to overexploit their 
  natural resources and thus degrade their environment. Social policies that tackle 
  the underlying cause of poverty therefore indirectly support environmental improvement. 
  Family planning and other population growth control strategies have been introduced 
  in some African countries and are beginning to yield positive results (UNDP 
  2000). Better education can also provide a way out of the poverty trap, and 
  there are efforts in African countries to ensure 'free education' for the young 
  to attain the goal of universal literacy.</p>
<p>In some countries, the health policies introduced have emphasized preventive 
  rather than curative strategies. <a href="323.htm#fig51">Figure 5.1</a> and 
  <a href="323.htm#fig52">Figure 5.2</a> show the impacts of policy responses 
  that improve accessibility to safe water and sanitation services. In both cases, 
  there is a direct inverse relationship between infant mortality and the increasing 
  percentage of the population that has access to safe water and sanitation. Removing 
  unhealthy environmental conditions can therefore contribute to reducing vulnerability 
  to disease (see <a href="234.htm">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
