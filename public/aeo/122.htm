<h3>HARVESTING OF COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES IN WESTERN AFRICA </h3>

<p><a name="fig2c6"></a>Small pelagic fish-herring, sardines and anchovies- are 
  the most abundant species in the fisheries off the Western African coast and 
  these represented almost half of all catches in 1994 (see <a href="#fig2c6">Figure 
  2c.6</a>). Catches have increased on average by 20 per cent per year since the 
  1950s under the impetus of national fisheries development policies. Total catches 
  of demersal stocks on the Mauritania continental shelf fell by almost twothirds 
  between 1984 and 1992, which could reflect a change in fishing strategy. In 
  Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia, demersal resources are considered to be 
  fully exploited or overexploited. In Cape Verde waters, the most important resource 
  is tuna, and recent data indicate that fisheries' resources in Cape Verde are 
  not fully exploited. In the west and central Gulf of Guinea, potential shrimp 
  catches have been estimated at 4 700 tonnes, which is above the maximum sustainable 
  yield (FAO 1997).</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, market forces have driven foreign fleets to fish in these 
  waters, to the detriment of catches by local countries. For example, fishing 
  agreements between African nations and the EU have been poorly negotiated because 
  African governments are in need of the foreign exchange and income capital. 
  Not only have commercial fishery stocks been drastically reduced, but other 
  species such as dolphins, sharks and turtles have also been affected and their 
  numbers are now declining (WWF 2001b).</p>
<h4>Sustainable harvesting of coastal and marine resources in Western Africa</h4>
<p>Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo are party to the UNCLOS which 
  protects national and international fishing rights and exploitation zones. However, 
  additional resources are required to enforce these regulations and to prosecute 
  law-breakers. Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Senegal have taken additional action 
  to protect their fisheries and Mauritania is banning all fishing except traditional, 
  non-motorized boat fishing by local communities in the Banc d'Arguin National 
  Park. Guinea- Bissau is establishing the Joao Viera/ Poilao National Park in 
  the Bijagos Archipelago, as a refuge for green turtles, dolphins, sharks, rays, 
  and migratory waterbirds. Senegal is also expected to establish marine protected 
  areas in the near future (WWF 2001b). These are in addition to the 25 existing 
  MPAs established to reduce pressures on natural resources from overharvesting, 
  pollution, and modification of the physical characteristics of the coastline. 
  However, enforcement of protection regulations in most MPAs has been limited 
  by lack of resources.</p>
