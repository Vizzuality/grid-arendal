<h5>Urban areas</h5>
<p> <i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the proportion of people living in urban 
  environments increases. However, there are also marked increases in access to 
  water and sanitation. There is a marked decrease in people living below the 
  poverty line, and in people living in urban slums and unplanned settlements. 
  There is also a greater control of waste management.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Central Africa </i></p>
<p>Urban areas continue to grow, albeit under much greater control. The involvement 
  of non-governmental actors is important, and improves urban management (access 
  to land use, housing and social infrastructure dispositions). The system of 
  revamping this sector functions, and reduces its effects on health.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Eastern Africa </i></p>
<p>Nearly 50 per cent of the population in this sub-region are living in urban 
  areas, attracted by increased employment opportunities and availability of services. 
  The social infrastructure is overstretched for the next 30 years, as investment 
  in infrastructure development continues to lag behind the population increase. 
  The housing shortfall currently stands at about 35 per cent (Habitat 2000) but, 
  in the Great Transitions scenario, this certainly reduces, with more involvement 
  of the private sector in the housing industry, despite the influx of people 
  to urban centres.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Northern Africa </i></p>
<p>In the Great Transitions scenario, the equitable distribution of public expenditure 
  amongst urban areas, and the emphasis on underdeveloped areas, brings them to 
  the same status. As the economic situation improves and many services become 
  privatized, more people have access to and can afford the services. Unleaded 
  petrol and natural gas widely replace other fossil fuels, as polluting industries 
  are moved out of urban areas to newly and specially developed areas, where planning 
  has taken environmental issues into consideration. Advancement in technology 
  means that environmentally harmful equipment, such as air conditioning units, 
  are replaced with new, safer technologies.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Southern Africa </i></p>
<p>Urban growth continues, but in a more planned fashion, as more people become 
  aware of the human risks and environmental dangers of shanty settlements. This 
  awareness is supported by growth in incomes, which enable many to afford decent 
  housing.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  Western Africa </i></p>
<p>Balanced and planned development activities and programmes in both urban and 
  rural areas stem urban migration. Pressure on urban services is reduced. Rural 
  areas experience a flow of former urbanites, especially retirees and young professionals, 
  who are gainfully employed or re-employed in their own localities and communities.</p>
<p><i><img src="images/bullet_blue.gif" width="5" height="5" vspace="3"> 
  West Indian Ocean Islands </i></p>
<p>Urban regeneration programmes enrol groups of people in public works programmes. 
  These lead to social education which transforms destructive tendencies to productive 
  avenues for urban governance and the provision of services. Religious retreats-established 
  in earlier years by fundamentalist groups of all persuasions, who were prepared 
  to fight to the death for the preservation of rights-are transformed into business, 
  educational and development retreats for reflection and social development projects.</p>
