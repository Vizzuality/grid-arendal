<h4>Management of pollution and waste in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>Cities tend to be areas of high population concentration, high economic status 
  and high levels of activity and therefore also consume natural resources from 
  their vicinity and from distant sources. In doing so they generate large amounts 
  of waste that are disposed of within and outside the urban areas. In Egypt, 
  Morocco, and Tunisia, solid waste generation in 1993 averaged 0.5-0.6 kg/capita/day 
  (UNCHS quoted in WRI, UNDP, UNEP & World Bank 1998).</p>
<p>The effectiveness of management of municipal waste in the sub-region varies 
  from country to country and, in some places, large amounts of wastes are not 
  deposited in sanitary landfill sites but are dumped in the open. In Tripoli, 
  for instance, 65 per cent of waste is dumped in the open, in Ismailia (Egypt) 
  80 per cent is dumped, and in Casablanca, 90 per cent (UNCHS 2001c). With extremely 
  warm temperatures, such waste tends to decompose rapidly, causing serious health 
  risks and nuisance (Kanbour 1997). Open burning of waste is an informal disposal 
  method used where waste collection services are inadequate, and it contributes 
  to the problem of urban air pollution. Unmanaged disposal of waste affects human 
  health, causes economic losses, and damages the physical and biological environments. 
  For example, it has led to problems such as pollution of water sources and offensive 
  odours, as well as an increase in disease vectors, pests, and scavengers. Health 
  risks also translate into economic losses with sick employees staying away from 
  their jobs and increasing the burden on public health care.</p>
<p>There are, however, successful examples of hygienic dumping and recycling of 
  waste in many countries in the sub-region. For example, Tripoli recycles 20 
  per cent of its solid waste, Tunis 5 per cent (UNCHS 2001c). In Egypt, waste 
  is also recycled through the informal sector, by the 'Zaballeen'-informal sector 
  garbage collectors who have been providing a door-to-door waste collection service 
  since the 1960's covering wide areas, especially in Cairo. They collect mainly 
  domestic waste and recycle up to 80 per cent of what they collect. Their activity 
  has recently been somewhat formalized by the government (UNCHS 1999). In rural 
  Egypt, there are organizations that promote environmental awareness among women, 
  distributing plastic bags so they could collect their garbage, while youths 
  are given the task of taking them to a designated collection point. Such schemes 
  can have equal success in urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="img2g3"></a>The high content of organic matter in waste has also created 
  interest among some municipal governments in the sub-region, and several composting 
  plants are already in operation producing compost fertilizers and soil conditioners 
  (Kanbour 1997). Whilst there are still no effective legal and institutional 
  frameworks for implementation of solid waste management at national level, the 
  issue has been given national priority in most countries in the sub-region. 
  Privatization of solid waste management has recently been introduced in the 
  sub-region as a way of overcoming the lack of finance and capabilities of local 
  governments and, in many areas, this has been more efficient and cost effective 
  in delivering services, especially in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco.</p>
Crowded cities in Northern Africa have also seen a significant increase in the 
number of motor vehicles and traffic congestion, creating additional problems 
of air pollution. In large cities, the situation is compounded by the presence 
of heavy industries surrounding residential areas and adding to the types and 
quantities of pollutants. In Tunis, many factories responsible for the worst air 
pollution were transferred to the outskirts of the city and air quality has improved, 
although at peak traffic times smog is still a problem (UNCHS 2001c). In Egypt, 
environmental legislation introduced in 1994 imposed strict regulations and penalties 
for polluting industries. Conversion to unleaded fuel for vehicles was also initiated. 
Within one year, the level of airborne lead in some of Cairo's most polluted areas 
had decreased by up to 88 per cent (USAID 2001). Urban transport reform is still 
a priority in the region, however, not only in terms of promoting more fuel efficient 
and cleanerfuelled vehicles, but also of upgrading roads and public transport 
systems to reduce congestion. 
<h4>Towards sustainable urban development in Northern Africa</h4>
<p>Meeting the challenges raised by the urban environment requires concerted government 
  action at all levels, in partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
  private enterprises, communities, and citizens. Institutional structures, together 
  with policies and frameworks, have been established in Northern African countries. 
  For example, the high population growth and urbanization rates experienced by 
  Libya in the 1970s and 1980s prompted the establishment of a Public Authority 
  for Environment, a centralized agency with presence in all major centres for 
  protection and cleansing of the environment. Solid waste disposal sites have 
  been established and are managed by the Public Authority, and some waste is 
  now recycled and used as inputs to industrial processes. Attention is also focused 
  on the provision of drinking water and maintenance of air quality (UNCHS 2001c). 
  In Tunis a department dealing with environmental issues has been created within 
  the municipal administration. It is critical that such efforts be maintained, 
  in order to continue to improve the social and environmental conditions in urban 
  areas, in the face of rapid population growth, urbanization, and development.</p>
