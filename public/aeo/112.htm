<h3>POLLUTION OF THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS' COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT

<p><a name="img2c6"></a>Increasing quantities of domestic and industrial waste 
  discharged without treatment into coastal waters have seriously affected coastal 
  and marine areas. This is a priority concern because of the high level of economic 
  dependence on tourism and other uses of coastal and marine resources. Coastal 
  populations are increasing and, in general, most of the countries in the sub-region 
  suffer from a lack of planning for urban development and for development of 
  tourism. Many informal settlements have grown up as a result of this situation 
  (UNEP 1998b). Approximately 41 per cent of the coastline of Mauritius has now 
  been developed for urban use, tourism or industrial purposes. These developments 
  are overloading existing wastewater and sewage treatment services, and the rate 
  of development of new infrastructure has not kept pace with rates of population 
  influx. For example, Seychelles treats only a fraction of its wastewater (19 
  per cent of domestic wastewater in 1995), and only eight hotels had sewage treatment 
  plants in 1997 (Shah 1995, Shah 1997). In Mauritius, two thirds of coastal residents 
  discharge their waste into the sea and in Comoros there are no wastewater treatment 
  facilities (UNEP 1999a).</p>
<p>Agricultural run-off, containing large volumes of silt, fertilizer and chemical 
  residues, further contributes to pollution problems by smothering habitats, 
  poisoning some species, and encouraging the proliferation of algal blooms which 
  in turn cause further loss of flora and fauna (PRE/COI 1998). Smothering of 
  seagrass beds, for example, results in loss of shelter, food, and nursery grounds 
  for important and valuable fish, shellfish, dugong and turtles (UNEP 1999a).</p>
<p>Industrial developments in the coastal zone include large fish processing plants, 
  tanneries, sugar refineries and shrimp farms. Many of these do not have wastewater 
  treatment facilities and discharge their wastes directly into the ocean (UNEP 
  1999a).</p>
<p>The increasing use of motorized vessels rather than human or sail-power for 
  fishing and pleasure craft is increasing pressure on the environment by causing 
  oil slicks and by direct physical damage from boat propellers.</p>
<p>There is also a high risk of major oil spills, given that 30 per cent of all 
  oil exports from the Near East pass through the sub-region (Salm 1996). This 
  high level of transport traffic also exposes the marine and coastal environments 
  to oil pollution through discharge of ballast water and oil leaks.</p>
<p>Commercial and domestic pollution of lagoons and coastal waters throughout 
  the sub-region has reduced the numbers and variety of fish available for local 
  consumption. This in turn has resulted in overexploitation of the remaining 
  stocks of certain popular species, causing collapse of the coral reef ecosystems 
  and reducing tourism opportunities (UNEP 1999a). Protected and endangered species 
  found in the region, such as marine turtles, dugongs, whales and dolphins, are 
  reportedly declining as a result of increasing levels of waste, notably plastics, 
  and of overfishing and predation by humans and other predators (UNEP 1998b).</p>
<h4>Enhancing coastal and marine environmental quality in the Western Indian Ocean 
  Islands</h4>
<p>All of the Western Indian Ocean Islands have signed the Nairobi Convention, 
  but effective actions for controlling pollution are yet to be implemented. The 
  Indian Ocean Commission has developed a five-year action plan for a Regional 
  Environmental Programme that concentrates on monitoring of coral reefs and ecotoxicology, 
  development of an environmental information system, and ICZM pilot projects. 
  The Regional Environmental Programme has established an agreement and a framework 
  for cooperation, as well as a proposed cooperation policy.</p>
<p>At the national level, Mauritius has introduced control of marine pollution 
  into its national law, as part of its obligation's under the UNCLOS. The island 
  has also drafted regulations to control pollution by oil, noxious liquid wastes, 
  harmful packaged substances, sewage and garbage, thus implementing the Convention 
  on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) (UNEP 1999a). The provisions 
  of the Convention would be strengthened by ratification by other Western Indian 
  Ocean Islands. Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles have all developed 
  National Environmental Action Plans, and Seychelles and Mauritius have Environmental 
  Protection Acts (UNEP 1999a). Provision of port reception facilities for oily 
  and other wastes (as required under MARPOL) is recommended, to enhance response 
  capacities to oil spills. Additional resources should be sought to improve equipment, 
  training, and financial resources for emergency response activities.</p>
<p>At the local level, schools and NGOs have been involved in coastal protection 
  and beach cleaning campaigns to prevent refuse, especially plastic bottles, 
  being washed out to sea.</p>
<h5>Towards ICZM in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h5>
<p>The Indian Ocean Commission's Regional Environmental Programme has been instrumental 
  in helping the subregion's countries to develop and implement Environmental 
  Management Plans and sustainable development policies. These include measures 
  such as coordination of development in the coastal zones and requirements for 
  assessments of environmental impacts prior to certain developments being undertaken.</p>
<p>Programmes to reduce coastal erosion have been implemented in Seychelles and 
  in Mauritius, with limited success. An approach combining construction of physical 
  defences, relocation of populations and industries, and adoption of new building 
  designs is likely to be most effective (Commonwealth Secretariat 1997).</p>
<p>Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles are parties to the UNEP Regional 
  Seas Programme for Eastern Africa, for which the Regional Coordinating Unit 
  is in Seychelles. The mission of the Eastern African Regional Coordinating Unit 
  is <i>'to provide leadership and encourage partnerships by inspiring, informing 
  and enabling nations and people of the Eastern African Region and their partners 
  to protect, manage and develop their Marine and Coastal Resources in a sustainable 
  manner.'</i> The components of an Action Plan for Eastern Africa provide a framework 
  for comprehensive action at the sub-regional and national level and activities 
  are designed to help the governments of the sub-region strengthen their environmental 
  management processes (UNEP 2001).</p>
<p>The objectives of the Action Plan for Eastern Africa are to promote sustainable 
  development through development of appropriate legislation, pollution prevention, 
  protection of the sub-region's living resources, strengthening of institutional 
  coordination and activities, capacity building, and raising awareness. Particular 
  attention is paid to assessment of causes and impacts of coastal and marine 
  environmental degradation, and adoption of financial arrangements for successful 
  and sustained implementation (UNEP 2001). </p>
