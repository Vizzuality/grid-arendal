<h2>WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h2>
<p>Forty-eight per cent of the population of the Western Indian Ocean Islands 
  lives in urban areas. The least urbanized countries are Madagascar (30 per cent) 
  and Comoros (33 per cent) (UNCHS 2001a). Seychelles is the most urbanized, at 
  63 per cent, followed by Mauritius at 41 per cent (UNCHS 2001a). Annual urban 
  population growth rates in the sub-region in the past thirty years have ranged 
  from one per cent in Mauritius to over five per cent in Comoros and Madagascar 
  (UNDP 2000). Urban growth rates over the next 15 years are expected to average 
  2.8 per cent per year, ranging from 4.5 per cent in Madagascar and 4.1 per cent 
  in Comoros to under 2 per cent in Mauritius and Seychelles (UNCHS 2001a).</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>The major factors encouraging rural-urban migration are the search for improved 
  standards of living, employment and educational opportunities, and for access 
  to communications and trade. In Mauritius, for example, economic growth averaged 
  7.7 per cent per year between 1985 and 1989 and 5.2 per cent per year between 
  1990 and 1999, with yearly growth in exports of 15.5 per cent and 6.4 per cent 
  over the same periods (World Bank 2001a). The port and capital city, Port Louis, 
  has facilitated this development through harbour operations, and, as a consequence, 
  has attracted numerous industries. In Seychelles, 90 per cent of the population 
  lives on the principle island of Mahe, with the majority (71 000 people) living 
  in the capital Victoria where the country's main economic activity, tourism, 
  is based.</p>
<h3>URBAN AREAS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ISLANDS</h3>
<p>The high rate of urbanization means that urban environments and infrastructure 
  providers are under extreme pressure to deliver goods and services. In addition, 
  many urban centres are located on the coast, where there are risks of environmental 
  disturbance, erosion, and pollution. The large and growing number of tourists 
  coming to the islands is also pushing up the demand for housing and infrastructure, 
  and land is being reclaimed and coastal wetlands drained. In Seychelles, for 
  example, coastal sand dunes are now being used for construction and land is 
  being reclaimed from the sea with irreparable damage to the reefs, wetlands, 
  marine and land eco-systems (UNEP 1999).</p>
<h4>Unplanned settlements in the Western Indian Ocean Islands</h4>
<p>Data on adequacy of shelter are only available for Mauritius, where most residents 
  are owners of their properties, and dwellings are of conventional type (UNCHS 
  2001c). The majority of towns and cities in the sub-region are growing faster 
  than the provision of infrastructure and there are shortfalls in water supply, 
  sanitation, waste disposal, roads and communications infrastructure, as well 
  as in health and educational facilities. However, the Western Indian Ocean Islands 
  fare better than many African countries, with all urban residents in Mauritius 
  and nearly all in Comoros enjoying access to improved water and sanitation (WHO/UNICEF 
  2000). In Madagascar 85 per cent of the urban population has access to water 
  supply and 70 per cent has access to some form of improved sanitation (WHO/UNICEF 
  2000).</p>
<p>Where these services are lacking, the urban population relies on septic tanks, 
  and pit latrines. If not properly managed (especially in informal settlements) 
  these can contaminate groundwater, and untreated domestic sewage-together with 
  storm water run-off from impermeable surfaces in urban areas-can threaten drinking 
  water supplies and the quality and safety of coastal waters. The result is a 
  risk to biodiversity and human health from enhanced breeding and transmission 
  of intestinal parasites, pests, and bacteria. Many of the urban developments-grown 
  from villages and concentrated along the coastlines- discharge their liquid 
  and solid wastes directly into the sea. For example, there are no waste management 
  facilities in Comoros (UNEP 1998).</p>
