<p>Although a number of regional, sub-regional and national organizations are 
  involved in various aspects of environmental management, research capacity in 
  this area is relatively weak, especially at sub-regional and national levels. 
  Research organizations lack sustainable sources of funding and there are, in 
  many cases, inadequate incentives for African researchers to engage in more 
  meaningful research, including research into the state of the region's environment, 
  and preparation of various scenarios for sustainable development paths and modelling 
  of vulnerability parameters. If such incentives are not provided, Africa will 
  continue to experience a 'brain drain' and will remain a technological backwater 
  condemned to 're-invent the wheel'. There is also room for the private sector 
  and civil society to participate in enhancing the knowledge base for sound environmental 
  management in African countries.</p>
<p>African states have a wealth of indigenous knowledge, some of which has been 
  used in the past to cope with natural disasters, and which could still be used 
  to address present and future environmental challenges. However, value must 
  first be attached to this heritage, and the issues of its ownership and of protection 
  of the associated intellectual property rights must also be addressed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the technologies that African countries require 
  to promote sustainable development in general, and to reduce poverty and enhance 
  environmental management in particular, are available globally. However, the 
  terms and conditions of access to these technologies do not appear to be favourable 
  to African countries, despite the provisions of Agenda 21. </p>

      <p>It was agreed at UNCED (the 1992 'Earth Summit') that, in order to facilitate

        states with appropriate technologies on affordable terms. Only limited 
        success has been achieved in this area so far, because many development

<p>African countries, for their part, should cease to 'reinvent the technological 
  wheel', and should invest in the development or adaptation of suitable technologies 
  and techniques. They should also address the subject of indigenous technologies. 
  That is to say, African countries should inventory, document and disseminate 
  information on available indigenous technologies that are appropriate to and, 
  by their very nature, affordable for environmental management.</p>
