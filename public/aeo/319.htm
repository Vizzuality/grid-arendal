<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The goals of sustainable development are summarized in Our Common Future, or 
  the Brundtland Commission, which states that we must meet 'the needs of the 
  present gen-eration without compromising the ability of future generations to 
  meet their own needs'. These needs could be economic, political, socio-cultural 
  and ecological. Thus, the management of the environment has always presented 
  people with many problems and challenges, largely because of its complex nature, 
  and of the com-plex interactions and relation-ships within it. Furthermore, 
  since environmental management valueladen, there is usually more than one way 
  of conceptualizing and expressing the value of the environment and its resources. 
  The result is that environmental management normally requires that we deal with 
  several elements of the envi-ronment, and with several perspectives reflecting 
  the different concepts and perceptions held by dif-ferent societies, belief 
  systems and interests.</p>
<p>We have constructed scenarios from: our understanding of current conditions 
  and driving forces; a vision of the future; and a coherent story of a process 
  of change, leading to that future. We have used both imagination and science 
  as ingredients for generating effective scenarios, and we have made quantitative 
  assumptions across a range of dimensions: eco-nomic growth and struc-ture, popula-tion, 
  technology, resources and the environment. We have used the scenarios to take 
  the inherent uncertainty in future development as the point of departure, and 
  to seek to formulate plausible stories about alternative possibilities that 
  can emerge from current conditions and driving forces.</p>
<p>As a first step in scenario development, we need to be able to calibrate relationships 
  between the more discerning vari-ables or driving forces with what occurs in 
  real-life situations. While data currently preclude a full investigation along 
  these lines, they are undoubtedly necessary for the future development of scenarios. 
  However, for studies which link vulnerability to scenario development, we need 
  to be able to define the stress variables, such as people under stress for water 
  or people living within a certain distance of a potentially dangerous hazard.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there seems to be no time more opportune than now to discuss 
  issues that affect the sustainability of the African environment. The reasons 
  are many, but perhaps most important is that there is a unity of purpose in 
  the minds of African leaders on the urgent need to eradicate poverty from the 
  region and to give development a much-needed direction. For instance, NEPAD 
  seeks 'to build on and celebrate the achievements of the past, as well as reflect 
  on the lessons learned through painful experience, so as to establish a partnership 
  that is both credible and capable of implementation. Africa must not be the 
  wards of benevolent guardians; rather they must be the architects of their own 
  sustained upliftment' (authors' emphasis). Furthermore, NEPAD centres around 
  African ownership and management, issues that were considered germane to development 
  of a Great Transitions scenario.</p>
