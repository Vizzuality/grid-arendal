            mining, cities and other infrastructure developments in the next 30 
            years unless urgent action is taken.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Latin 
            America and the Caribbean region is likely to be the hardest hit with 
            more than 80 per cent of the land affected, closely followed by Asia 
            and the Pacific region. Here, over 75 per cent of the land may well 
            be affected by habitat disturbance and other kinds of environmental 
            damage as a result of rapid and poorly planned infrastructure growth.</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Meanwhile 
            more than half the people in the world could be living in severely 
            water-stressed areas by 2032 if market forces drive the globe's political, 
            economic and social agenda.</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>West 
            Asia, which includes areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, is likely 
            to be the worst affected with well over 90 per cent of the population 
            expected to be living in areas with "severe water stress" by 2032.</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>However, 
            the proportion of hungry people in the world appears set to fall. 
            Under one future scenario hunger declines to as little as 2.5 per 
            cent of the global population by 2032 - in line with the United Nations 
            Millennium Declaration goals.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Concerted 
            action involving governments, industry and individual citizens could 
            also deliver deep cuts in emissions of the gases linked with global 
            warming. Levels of carbon dioxide could, with sufficient public and 
            private will, begin stabilizing in the atmosphere by 2032.</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>These 
            are just some of the striking findings from the United Nations Environment 
            Programme's  (UNEP) ground-breaking Global Environment Outlook-3 (GEO-3) 
            report. The study takes a unique look at the policies and environmental 
            impacts of the past 30 years. It then outlines four policy approaches 
            for the next three decades (Choices for the Future section of the 
            news release) and compares and contrasts the likely impacts on people 
            and the natural world.</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Over 
            1 000 people, many from a global network of collaborating centres, 
            have contributed to the preparation of GEO-3. The report says the 
            planet is at a crucial cross-roads with the choices made today critical 
            for the forests, oceans, rivers, mountains, wildlife and other life 
            support systems upon which current and future generations depend.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>GEO-3 
            concludes that a great deal of environmental change has already taken 
            place in the past 30 years since the 1972 Stockholm conference which 
            led to the creation of UNEP.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Improvements 
            have occurred in areas such as river and air quality in places like 
            North America and Europe. The international effort to repair the ozone 
            layer, the Earth's protective shield, by reducing the production and 
            consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is another notable success. 
            But generally there has been a steady decline in the environment, 
            especially across large parts of the developing world.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The 
            declining environmental quality of planet Earth and the apparent increase 
            in strength and frequency of natural hazards such as cyclones, floods 
            and droughts are intensifying peoples' vulnerability (GEO-3 Chapter 
            3) to food insecurity, ill health and unsustainable livelihoods, says 
            the report.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The 
            poor, the sick and the disadvantaged, both within societies and in 
            different countries and regions, are particularly vulnerable. Everyone 
            is vulnerable to some extent to environmental threats but there is 
            evidence that the gap between those able and those unable to cope 
            with rising levels of environmental change is widening.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It 
            is estimated that the number of people affected by disasters climbed 
            from an average of 147 million a year in the 1980s to 211 million 
            a year in the 1990s. Global financial losses from natural disasters 
            were, in 1999, estimated to cost over US$ 100 billion.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The 
            level of weather-related disasters has climbed with some experts linking 
            this to climate change due to human-made emissions. In the 1990s, 
            90 per cent of those killed were victims of events such as floods, 
            windstorms and droughts.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Indeed 
            behind nearly all the assessments and forecasts outlined in the report 
            lies the spectre of global warming and its potential to wreak havoc 
            on weather patterns over the coming decades.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>GEO-3 
            says environmental degradation is also costing countries in other 
            ways. India, for example, is losing more than US$ 10 billion annually 
            or 4.5 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with human-induced 
            land degradation alone causing productivity losses of around US$ 2.4 
            billion.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Declining 
            environmental quality is also a rising health risk. Sewage pollution 
            of the seas "has precipitated a health crisis of massive proportions", 
            says the report.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>For 
            example, the eating of contaminated shellfish is causing an estimated 
            2.5 million cases of infectious hepatitis annually, resulting in 25 
            000 deaths and a further 25 000 people suffering long-term disability 
            due to liver-damage.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>GEO-3 
            concludes that one of the key driving forces has been the growing 
            gap between the rich and poor parts of the globe. Currently, one-fifth 
            of the world's population enjoys high, some would say excessive, levels 
            of affluence. It accounts for nearly 90 per cent of total personal 
            consumption globally. In comparison, around 4 billion people are surviving 
            on less than US$ 1 to $ 2 a day.</span></p>

            World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD)</span></b></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Klaus 
            Toepfer, Executive Director of the UNEP, speaking at the launch taking 
            place in London, United Kingdom, said: " I must pay tribute to the 
            scientists and experts who have made this assessment possible. GEO-3, 
            like its two predecessors, is truly a unique collaborative accomplishment. 
            The latest report gives us even more pause for thought as it looks 
            out 30 years to four possible futures. We can never know for certain 
            what lies before us, the future is another country. But we know enough 
            now to see how our actions or lack of actions might shape the environment 
            and the inhabitants of this extraordinary blue planet by 2032.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"GEO-3 
            is neither a document of doom and gloom or a gloss over the acute 
            challenges facing us all. It is the most authoritative assessment 
            of where we have been, where we have reached and where we are likely 
            to go. The facts in the report underline the huge amount of knowledge 
            that has now been accumulated about the condition of Earth. It also 
            highlights the successes of governments, industry, the public and 
            others in trying to restore and sustain its damaged and beleaguered 
            freshwaters, lands, wildlife, oceans and atmosphere, especially in 
            those continents and countries that can afford it," he said.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"We 
            now have hundreds of declarations, agreements, guidelines and legally 
            binding treaties designed to address environmental problems and the 
            threats they pose to wildlife and human health and well being.  Let 
            us now find the political courage and the innovative financing needed 
            to implement these deals and steer a healthier, more prosperous, course 
            for planet Earth. Ten years ago, governments met in Rio for the Earth 
            Summit. In just three months, we have the World Summit on Sustainable 
            Development (WSSD) in South Africa. This is a summit for sustainable 
            development, but it is also a summit for the environment. Environment 
            for Development is UNEP's motto, for without the environment there 
            can never be the kind of development needed to secure a fair deal 
            for this or future generations. We need concrete actions, we need 
            concrete timetables and we need an iron will from all sides. It cannot 
            be the responsibility of politicians alone. We are all shareholders 
            in this enterprise. Only then can the promises made in Rio turn into 
            a reality," said Mr Toepfer.</span></p>

            ha. Excessive and poorly managed irrigation can degrade soils through 
            impacts such a salinization - a build up of salts. Over 10 per cent, 
            between 25 and 30 million ha, of the world's irrigated lands are classed

          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Soil 
            erosion is a key factor in land degradation. Around 2 000 million

            or an area bigger than the United States and Mexico combined, is now

            one-sixth of this, a total of 305 million ha of soils are either "strongly
