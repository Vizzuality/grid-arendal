      <p>The world economy has, on aggregate, expanded considerably over the past 
        three decades, despite significant fluctuations. World gross national 
        product (GNP) more than doubled from approximately US$14 300 billion in 
        1970 to an estimated US$29 995 billion in 1999 (Costanza and others 1997, 
        World Bank 2001). However, these figures do not include the value of environmental 
        goods and services which are critical to the Earth's life-support systems, 
        and contribute to human welfare but are outside the market. An estimate 
        of the economic value of these ecosystem services is between US$16 000 
        billion and US$54 000 billion a year, with an average of US$33 000 billion 
        a year. This estimate should be considered a minimum because of the nature 
        of the uncertainties (Costanza and others 1997).</p>

      <p><a name="fig34b"></a>The world economy grew by 3.1 per cent annually 
        in real gross domestic product (GDP) between 1980 and 1990, and 2.5 per 
        cent annually between 1990 and 1998, with annual per capita growth rates 
        of 1.4 and 1.1 per cent respectively (UNCTAD 2000). There has, however, 
        been significant regional variability over this period, with by far the 
        highest growth rates in Asia and the Pacific, which contains more than 
        half the world population. Per capita GDP (in constant US$1995) almost 
        doubled in Northwest Pacific and East Asia during 1972-99, growing by 
        an annual average of 2.4 per cent a year (compiled from World Bank 2001); 
        by contrast, it fell in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite global economic growth, 
        the gap between rich and poor has widened both between developed and developing 
        countries and within countries, particularly in Latin America and sub-Saharan 
        Africa (UNDP 2001). Per capita incomes have risen only marginally in most 
        regions, with the exceptions of Europe and North America (see figure right). 
        Currently 3.5 billion people in low-income countries earn less than 20 
        per cent of the world's income, while the 1 billion people living in developed 
        countries earn 60 per cent (UN 2000). The ratio between income earned 
        in countries with the richest 20 per cent of the population, compared 
        to the world's poorest 20 per cent, has also widened - from 30:1 in 1960, 
        to 60:1 in 1990, to 74:1 in 1997 (UNDP 1999).</p>
      <p>Growth in use of energy (see box) and transport are both indicators of 
        economic development, and both have severe impacts on the environment. 
        Private vehicular transportation has become an entrenched lifestyle choice 
        among those who can afford it. Since the 1970s, about 16 million new vehicles 
        have come onto the world's roads annually (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and 
        WRI 1998) and passenger cars account for 15 per cent of total global energy 
        consumption (Jepma and others 1995). </p>

            <p>Energy is a key to socio-economic development. It is also central 
              to achieving the economic, social and environmental goals of sustainable 
              development. Harnessing energy has dramatically expanded people's 
              choices, allowing those with access to enjoy unprecedented productivity, 
              mobility and comfort. But the per capita use of electricity illustrates 
              a major energy divide. The OECD annual average of 8 053 kilowatt-hours 
              (kWh) per capita is nearly 100 times greater than in the least developed 
              countries where it is only 83 kWh per capita (UNDP/UNDESA/WEC 2000). 
            </p>
            <p>The annual growth rate in total energy use between 1972 and 1999 
              averaged 2 per cent a year but this decreased from 2.8 per cent 
              in the 1970s to 1.5 per cent in the 1980s and 2.1 per cent in the 
              1990s (IEA 1999). This decrease was due to weak economic performance 
              in the transition economies in Europe in the 1990s, compounded by 
              the global financial crisis of 1997-98 (UNDP/UNDESA/WEC 2000). </p>
            <p>The human benefits of energy production and consumption frequently 
              have an environmental downside, which may in turn threaten human 
              health and quality of life. Impacts on atmospheric composition, 
              deforestation leading to soil erosion and siltation of water bodies, 
              the disposal of nuclear fuel waste, and occasional catastrophic 
              accidents such as Chernobyl are some of the widely recognized problems. 
            </p>
            <p>Globally, per capita consumption has changed relatively little 
              over the past 30 years although total consumption grew by some 70 
              per cent during 1972-99. At the regional level, per capita consumption 
              has fallen in North America, the greatest consumer, and risen most 
              sharply in West Asia. Reducing fossil fuel energy consumption in 
              areas of high consumption, and achieving more balanced per capita 
              consumption within and between countries, are environmental imperatives 
              for the 21st century.</p>

      <p>Inequalities in income are also reflected in similar disparities in material 
        consumption (see 'The Ecological Footprint'). It has been estimated that 
        the richest 20 per cent of the world's population accounts for 86 per 
        cent of total private consumption expenditure, consumes 58 per cent of 
        the world's energy, 45 per cent of all meat and fish, 84 per cent of paper, 
        and owns 87 per cent of cars and 74 per cent of telephones. Conversely, 
        the poorest 20 per cent of the world population consumes 5 per cent or 
        less of each of these goods and services (UNDP 1998).</p>

            <p>The Ecological Footprint is an estimate of human pressure on global 
              ecosystems, expressed in 'area units'. Each unit corresponds to 
              the number of hectares of biologically-productive land required 
              to produce the food and wood people consume, the infrastructure 
              people use, and to absorb the CO<sub>2</sub> produced from burning 
              fossil fuels; thus the footprint takes into account the total impact 
              people have on the environment. </p>
            <p>The world's Ecological Footprint is a function of population size, 
              average per capita consumption of resources, and the resource intensity 
              of the technology used. During 1970-96, the world's Ecological Footprint 
              rose from about 11 000 million area units to more than 16 000 million 
              area units. The world average footprint remained fairly constant 
              during 1985-96 at 2.85 area units per capita.</p>

      <p>For many developing countries poverty, unemployment and low productivity 
        are major concerns. In developing countries as a whole, the informal sector 
        provides 37 per cent of employment, and as much as 45 per cent in Africa 
        (UNCHS 2001). In the 1980s, structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) were 
        introduced by the World Bank to correct underlying economic imbalances 
        and improve economic efficiency through reforms. SAPs have had economic, 
        social and environmental impacts, including negative impacts on social 
        stability and environmental sustainability (Reed 1996). Poverty, unemployment 
        and falling standards of living also emerged as significant problems for 
        countries in economic transition in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>One critical issue is that of external debt which stood at US$2 572 614 
        million in 1999 (World Bank 2001). The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
        (HIPCs) initiative was launched in 1996 and by November 2001 debt-reduction 
        packages totalling US$36 000 million had been committed to 24 countries 
        (mainly in Africa) (IMF 2001). However, there has been some disappointment 
        with the initiative, and many of the countries receiving HIPC debt relief 
        still spend more on debt servicing than on basic education or health (Oxfam 
        2001).</p>
