      <p><a name="fig282"></a>In Europe, the most common natural disasters are 
        storms and floods, although earthquakes do occur in some countries. Storms 
        and floods are also the most costly in terms of economic and insured losses. 
        The windstorms Lothar and Martin that occurred in December 1999 caused 
        an estimated €5 billion damage to crops, forests and infrastructure while 
        the cost of flood damage between 1991 and 1995 has been estimated at €99 
        billion. One of the worst years ever in terms of flood damage was 2000, 
        accounting for almost one-quarter of the total US$10.6 billion insured 
        costs (Swiss Re 2001). In recent years, many European countries have experienced 
        abnormally high precipitation intensity and duration, especially in winter 
        months, which has led to floods in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
        Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. 
        Between 1971 and 1996, 163 major floods occurred in Europe. The main factors 
        that induce or intensify floods and their impacts include climate change, 
        land sealing, changes in the catchment and floodplain land use, population 
        growth, urbanization and increasing settlement, roads and railways and 
        sometimes hydraulic engineering measures (EEA 2001a).Forest fires and 
        droughts are a problem in the southern countries along the rim of the 
        Mediterranean (Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia and Spain) and 
        fires are also common in the Siberian region of the Russian Federation 
        where economic recession has caused a severe decline in the response capacity 
        of local authorities and forest fire teams. Each year, hundreds of thousand 
        of hectares of taiga forest are lost due to fires. Around 80 per cent 
        of forest fires are a result of people’s ignorance of fire safety rules. 
      </p>
      <p>The average annual number of natural disasters appears to be increasing 
        and since the late 1980s there has also been an increase in the impacts 
        of these disasters and their related economic losses — at least in the 
        European Union (EEA 1999). For example, at the French–German border, the 
        floodwaters of the Rhine rose more than 7m above flood level about once 
        every 20 years between 1900 and 1977. Since 1977, that level has been 
        reached on average once every other year (UWIN 1996). Actions and measures 
        are taken at both national and regional level to reduce the impacts of 
        natural disasters (see box), though there is no targeted policy. Integrated 
        land-use planning can, to some extent, prevent impacts on humans. Emergency 
        response plans have been produced throughout the European Union to react 
        to various natural disasters, but these appear to be ad hoc, generally 
        not tested, and are considered unlikely to work well in practice (EEA 
        1999).</p>

          <td> 
            <p>In January 1998, the 12th Conference of Rhine Ministers adopted 
              an Action Plan on Flood Defence to be implemented over 20 years. 
              The most important aims of the plan are to reduce damage by up to 
              10 per cent by the year 2005 and by up to 25 per cent by 2020. Extreme 
              flood levels downstream of the regulated Upper Rhine are to be reduced 
              by up to 30 cm by 2005 and by up to 70 cm by 2020. These ambitious 
              targets are likely to be reached only through an integrated managerial 
              approach at local, national, regional and international levels.</p>
            <p>Over the past two centuries, the Rhine has lost more than 85 per 
              cent of its natural floodplains to buildings and agriculture. There 
              were severe floods in 1993 and 1995. The assets that could be affected 
              in areas at flood risk may amount to €1 500 billion. Countermeasures, 
              such as the preservation and expansion of floodplains, and improved 
              water storage in the entire catchment area, must aim at the ecological 
              improvement of the Rhine, its valley and catchment area.</p>
