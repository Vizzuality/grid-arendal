      <p><a name="fig370"></a>These changes in energy use, along with shifts in 
        fuel use, are reflected in gaseous emissions, notably of carbon dioxide 
        (see chart right). There are some striking differences between scenarios 
        and subregions. The growth in emissions is quite significant in all regions 
        in <i>Markets First</i>, with transport contributing a major share. The 
        economic difficulties in <i>Security First</i> for Eastern Europe result 
        in approximately the same level of emissions as in <i>Policy First</i>, 
        where more proactive policy action prompts improved energy use and a switch 
        to noncarbon fuels. In a <i>Sustainability First</i> situation, strong 
        policy actions and changes in lifestyles, including the willingness of 
        more people to shift to public transport, achieve significant reductions, 
        heralding a turning-point in the battle to reduce human-induced climate 
        change.</p>
      <p>Land use change in Europe is affected by decisions related to spatial 
        planning of development and transportation policies. It is also driven 
        by the evolution of agricultural policy, including changes in agricultural 
        trade regimes and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. In the 
        <i>Markets First</i> scenario, the built-up area grows over time in Western 
        Europe (see below). Elsewhere, population decline leads to a stable or 
        modest decrease in the total built-up area in <i>Markets First</i> and 
        throughout the region in <i>Policy First</i> and <i>Sustainability First</i>, 
        where already compact settlement patterns combine with lower population 
        growth to reduce the need for expansion of built-up areas. In <i>Security 
        First</i>, rising populations and more sprawling settlements trigger sizeable 
        growth of built-up areas in Western Europe but little increase in the 
        rest of the region.</p>

      <p>At the same time, continued development of roads, plantations and other 
        human works will lead to the extension of infrastructure throughout the 
        region and in all scenarios, with a general increase in levels of impact 
        (see chart above). Even so, careful policies - including restrictions 
        on the siting of infrastructure - can help to lessen the effect of this 
        expansion. This potential is most evident in Eastern Europe. In <i>Markets 
        First</i> and <i>Security First</i>, rising pressures to develop resources 
        and infrastructure reduce remaining biodiversity. Impacts include loss 
        of reindeer and wolf populations and of many insects and plants adapted 
        to farmed conditions. To restore lost habitat, particularly where lost 
        agro-ecosystems and wetlands are concerned, would require <i>Sustainability 
        First</i> conditions.</p>
      <p>These pressures play a role in determining landbased biodiversity in 
        the region. Europe must also contend with the effects of changing climate 
        conditions, including those determined by greenhouse gas emissions that 
        have already occurred. Overall, differences between the various scenarios 
        by 2032 are small, owing to the delayed effect of climatic changes over 
        foregoing decades. Furthermore, in the short term, the greater regional 
        and global reductions in sulphur oxides and other pollutants seen in <i>Policy 
        First</i> and <i>Sustainability First</i> actually result in faster climate 
        change, increasing the pressure on ecosystems. However, present-day initiatives 
        such as the EU's Natura 2000 take effect and pan-European networks of 
        protected areas and green corridors are launched to protect biodiversity 
        more effectively in <i>Sustainability First</i> and possibly in <i>Policy 
        First</i>, too. Effective action to rehabilitate former agricultural land 
        as additional habitats for wildlife also plays an important role. This 
        is reflected in the somewhat better results for the Natural Capital Index 
        (see chart below) in <i>Sustainability First</i>.</p>
      <p>Shifts in agriculture, along with improved technologies, management practices 
        and shifts in crop choices reduce overall water demand in agriculture 
        in all scenarios other than <i>Security First</i>. Under the <i>Markets 
        First</i> scenario, however, economic development still leads to sharp 
        increases in overall water demand, especially in Eastern and Central Europe. 
        With these increases comes expansion of areas in the severe water stress 
        category. Overall demand in a <i>Security First</i> scenario is similar, 
        with the greater population by comparison with <i>Markets First</i> somewhat 
        offset by reduced economic activity.</p>

      <p>The situation is very different under the <i>Policy First</i> and <i>Sustainability 
        First</i> scenarios, where structural changes lead to reductions in water 
        withdrawals in all sectors across Europe. Through these continuing efforts 
        to save water, some of the river basins that currently experience severe 
        water stress, no longer do so under these scenarios. With this advance, 
        the number of people who live in areas with severe water stress drops 
        significantly. These changes are most dramatic in <i>Sustainability First</i>, 
        where declines in meat consumption augment policies, such as water pricing, 
        introduced in the other scenarios. Differences in the amount of wastewater 
        that is purified and industrial recycling of water amplify the differences 
        between the scenarios. These changes are reflected in the number of persons 
        subject to water stress in the sub-regions across the different scenarios 
        (see charts below). Potential problems related to water stress in <i>Policy 
        First</i> and <i>Sustainability First</i> are reduced by full implementation 
        of the Water Framework Directive and agreements regarding regional seas. 
        Meanwhile, these problems intensify in a <i>Security First</i> world, 
        leading to conflict over water and contamination from uncontrolled industrial 
        activity and the inability to deal with the legacies of former lax policies.<br clear="all">
