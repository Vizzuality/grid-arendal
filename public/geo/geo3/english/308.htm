      <p><a name="fig176a"></a>The Arctic holds much of the world's freshwater 
        supply and its landscape is dominated by freshwater systems. The two main 
        permanent ice fields are the ice pack of the Arctic Ocean (8 million km<sup>2</sup>) 
        and the Greenland ice cap (1.7 million km<sup>2</sup>), which together 
        hold 10 per cent of the world's freshwater. The Greenland ice cap produces 
        about 300 km<sup>3</sup> of icebergs a year. The Arctic has several of 
        the world's largest rivers. They pour 4 200 km<sup>3</sup> of freshwater 
        into the Arctic Ocean annually along with about 221 million tonnes of 
        sediment (Crane and Galasso 1999, AMAP 1997).</p>
      <p>Low temperatures, low nutrient, short light availability and a brief 
        growing season limit the primary productivity of Arctic freshwater systems. 
        This in turn restricts the animal life that can be supported. Nevertheless, 
        the river systems are heavily populated by several fish species such as 
        the Arctic charr, and the North Atlantic and Pink salmon. In recent years, 
        the overall warming trend plus increased recreational and commercial fisheries 
        use have put pressure on these populations. Accidental introduction of 
        alien species and increased fish farming is another source of concern 
        (Bernes 1996). Eutrophication is a recent problem in several lakes in 
        Scandinavia where human settlements have raised nutrient levels.</p>
      <p>Northbound rivers are major pathways of pollutants from sources far inland, 
        especially in the Russian Federation. In the spring, these contaminants 
        are deposited into the freshwater systems and eventually into the marine 
        environment and can be transported thousands of kilometres from their 
        sources via the Arctic's marine circulation patterns. Contaminants include 
        chemicals from agricultural, industrial and petroleum production, radionuclides 
        from nuclear testing and military activities, and water soluble salts 
        (Crane and Galasso 1999). The Arctic countries adopted a circumpolar Regional 
        Programme of Action for Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment against 
        Land-based Activities (based on the Global Programme of Action for the 
        Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities) as well 
        as National Programmes of Action in some countries, including the Russian 
        Federation. These instruments are too recent to assess long-term effectiveness 
        (PAME 1998).<br clear="all">

      <p><a name="fig176b"></a>Opposition to damming is strong in the Nordic countries. 
        During 1975-2001, the Cree people fought the government of Quebec over 
        environmental damage to their lands. In a surprise move in October 2001, 
        however, the Cree reversed their stand and signed an agreement in principle 
        to allow the government of Quebec to build another large power development 
        project on the Eastmain-Rupert river system in exchange for a cash settlement. 
        In 2000, a hydroelectric power project that would have flooded an important 
        wetland was rejected (Arctic Bulletin 2001). In 2001, Iceland's National 
        Planning Agency rejected plans for a hydroelectric power project that 
        would have dammed two of the three main rivers flowing from Europe's largest 
        glacier and destroyed a vast wilderness.</p>
      <p>Since the 1970s, surface air temperatures appear to have increased on 
        average 1.5°C per decade over continental Siberia and western portions 
        of North America, both of which are major sources of freshwater into the 
        Arctic basin. The opposite trend is occurring in Greenland and Canada's 
        eastern Arctic where there is a negative trend of -1°C per decade (AMAP 
        1997). The warming trend has resulted in thawing of the continuous permafrost 
        in Alaska and northern Russia (Morison and others 2000, IPCC 2001).</p>
      <p>Arctic countries have partially responded to threats to their freshwater 
        systems by establishing protected areas and designating important wetland 
        areas under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Nearly 
        half the protected area in the Arctic is the Greenland ice cap and glaciers 
        which store freshwater.</p>
