      <p>West Asia also faces increasing pressures on its biodiversity. Infrastructure 
        expands in all scenarios (see chart below), destroying and fragmenting 
        the region's ecosystems. These pressures lead to steady decline in populations 
        of wild species, a growing list of threatened species and an overall and 
        continual loss of biodiversity. These trends are counteracted to some 
        degree in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>circumstances 
        by implementing land use management plans to reduce human pressures on 
        natural ecosystems. Other counter measures include legislation protecting 
        biodiversity and endangered species as well as regulating the introduction 
        of foreign and genetically modified organisms. Only slower economic growth 
        in <i>Security First </i>keeps the expansion of infrastructure and its 
        impacts below that of <i>Markets First</i>.</p>
      <p>Other problems, particularly climate change, join with these pressures 
        to diminish natural capital in the region in all scenarios. In <i>Policy 
        First</i>, present efforts to enlarge protected areas continue and may 
        reach international targets. In addition, regional cooperation and transboundary 
        reserves are established between neighbouring countries. Public awareness 
        is stimulated through botanical gardens and museums. These efforts go 
        further in <i>Sustainability First </i>where there is greater local control 
        of resources. The extent of protected areas reaches target levels, halting 
        depletion of biological resources. Furthermore, the region witnesses an 
        increase in cooperative regional research, investment and sustainable 
        use of genetic and biological resources through the use of advanced technology. 
        However, even here the efforts are not enough to fully counteract the 
        effects of changing climate (see chart).</p>

        that the losses to natural capital are somewhat less than in <i>Policy

        of foreign and genetically modified species carries on unregulated, posing 
        a major additional threat to indigenous species in the region. Moreover, 
        efforts already under way become increasingly ineffective under declining 
        economic and environmental conditions and food insecurity. Significantly, 
        many indigenous biological resources in the region could be completely 
        lost.</p>

      <p><a name="fig387"></a>Differences in population growth, urban planning 
        and zoning, rural area development and the situation of refugees all influence 
        the level, type and impact of urbanization across the region. Rapid unplanned 
        urbanization and high population concentrations caused by rapid population 
        growth, rural to urban migration and the increase in refugee numbers are 
        factors in both <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security First</i>. All have 
        negative environmental and health consequences in terms of local air pollution 
        (see chart), add to waste production and encourage encroachment on limited 
        agricultural and recreational areas. Basic healthcare, sanitation and 
        infrastructure facilities fail to cope.</p>
      <p>More effective urban planning and zoning prevail in <i>Policy First </i>and 
        <i>Sustainability First </i>scenarios. Rural to urban migration is reduced 
        conspicuously by well-planned integrated development of rural areas. In 
        <i>Sustainability First</i>, rural area development includes environmental 
        considerations to minimize encroachment and loss of agricultural and recreational 
        lands, stimulating some reverse migration. Finally, in the Mashriq, the 
        environmental and health problems associated with refugee centres are 
        solved as part of the resolution of conflicts in the region.</p>
      <p>Associated with the differences in land use and freshwater management, 
        as well as other developments, the scenarios also differ in their implications 
        for coastal and marine areas. Under the <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>scenarios, member states in the Arabian Gulf ratify the Convention 
        for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) 73/78 and other 
        established protocols, establish waste oil reception facilities and declare 
        the Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
        (ROPME) Sea Area a Special Area, which reduces oil pollution significantly. 
        The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
        from Land-Based Activities is strictly implemented, controlling and significantly 
        reducing sewage releases into the sea.</p>

      <p>These environmental trends, along with more broadly distributed economic 
        growth and effective social policies, are reflected in the incidence of 
        hunger in the region (see charts above). In both <i>Markets First </i>and 
        <i>Security First</i>, the levels of hunger are still near 10 per cent 
        in 2032. In the <i>Markets First </i>scenario, relatively high inequality 
        persists, limiting the improvements that can be achieved from economic 
        growth. In the <i>Security First </i>scenario, divergent income distributions 
        worsen the situation even more. Combined with the population growth, the 
        numbers of persons experiencing hunger increase by half in <i>Markets 
        First </i>and approximately double in <i>Security First</i>. In <i>Policy 
        First </i>and <i>Sustainability First</i>, a combination of relatively 
        high economic growth and comparatively equitable income distributions 
        leads to a sharp drop in the percentage hungry, as well as in the total.</p>

                planning reduce impacts of drought, in turn enhancing the efficiency 
                of water use, resource protection and water resources augmentation.</li>
              <li>Major institutional reforms further consolidate the authority 
                of water resources management bodies. Previous policy shifts in 
                favour of 'demand management and conservation' ease the way for 
                additional measures to eke out water supplies.</li>
              <li>More freshwater is made available by desalination technology 
                in the GCC countries, increasingly using alternative and renewable 
                energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to run desalination 
                plants.</li>
              <li>There is widespread application of biotechnology to crop production, 
                to boost drought resistance and yields.</li>
              <li>More equitable sharing of surface and groundwater resources 
                is achieved as riparian countries sign and ratify treaties to 
                that effect. This process is helped by the resolution of the Arab-Israeli 
                conflict.</li>

            <p><b>The lessons</b><br>
              Developments not directly related to the environment, such as improvements 
              in regional cooperation, can have a major impact on environmental 
              issues. Similarly, the ways in which one environmental issue is 
              tackled can have significant impacts on others, for instance the 
              choice of renewable energy sources to power desalinization works 
              reduces fossil-fuel burning. Experience and adoption of a mixed 
              set of policy instruments allows greater flexibility to react swiftly 
              in times of unexpected and increased environmental stress.</p>
