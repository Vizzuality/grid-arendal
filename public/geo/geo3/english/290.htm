      <p>Overloading with organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in the 1970s 
        and 1980s resulted in eutrophication of seas, lakes, rivers and groundwater 
        throughout Europe. The main source of nitrogen is fertilizers in run-off 
        from agricultural land. Most phosphorus comes from households and industry 
        wastewater, though in areas with intensive agriculture in Western Europe, 
        phosphorus from agriculture approaches 50 per cent of the total load (EEA 
        2001). In Western Europe, fertilizer consumption has fallen since the 
        mid-1980s but eutrophication has continued due to increased nutrient run-off 
        from intensive livestock production. In CEE, use of agrochemicals has 
        declined markedly since the early 1990s, resulting in a reduction of nitrogen-phosphorus 
        fertilizer use by about 50 per cent (Czech Republic 1999, Republic of 
        Hungary 1999).</p>
      <p>Pollution of groundwater is another serious problem, mainly associated 
        with nitrates and pesticides from agriculture (EEA 1998). In the Russian 
        Federation alone, more than 2 700 sources of groundwater were identified 
        as polluted in 1999 (RFEP 2000).</p>
      <p>Phosphorus discharges from urban wastewater treatment plants in Western 
        Europe have fallen significantly (50-80 per cent) since the early 1980s, 
        largely due to the huge increase in treatment of wastewater (ETC/WTR 2001) 
        and wide-scale introduction of phosphorus-free detergents. By the end 
        of the 1990s, 90 per cent of Western Europeans were connected to sewers 
        and 70 per cent to wastewater treatment plants (ETC/WTR 2001). In CEE, 
        however, 30-40 per cent of households were not yet connected to sewers 
        by 1990 and treatment was inadequate (EEA 1999c). Since 1990, most Accession 
        Countries have started to invest heavily in sewage collection and treatment 
        but its high cost is one of the major financial issues in the accession 
        process (Republic of Slovenia 1999). In the Eastern European countries 
        of the former Soviet Union, little has been done to improve wastewater 
        treatment.</p>
      <p>Many lakes that had high phosphorus concentrations in the early 1980s 
        have lower concentrations today. However, only slight changes in phosphorus 
        concentrations have been observed in initially less-affected lakes (EEA 
        2000). This is mainly due to accumulation and (delayed) release of phosphorus 
        from lake bottoms or continued contamination from small, scattered dwellings 
        and from agricultural sources. Overall, water quality in many European 
        lakes is still poor (ETC/WTR 2001). Heavy pollution in Western European 
        rivers such as the Rhine has declined significantly since 1980 (ETC/WTR 
        2001) but improvements have been less significant in southern and Central 
        Europe. In Eastern Europe, the situation is different. In the Russian 
        Federation and Ukraine, the two most industrialized countries of the former 
        Soviet Union, discharge of polluted water into rivers increased in the 
        second half of the 1980s and in the 1990s, despite an alleged clean-up 
        campaign for the Volga and Ural rivers as early as 1972 (see box below).</p>

          <td>In the early 1970s, funds of 1.2 billion roubles were allocated 
            for a clean-up plan for the Volga and the Ural rivers (Bush 1972) 
            - one of the first publicly announced projects to clean up industrial 
            rivers and safeguard the water supply. Many ministries were charged 
            with negligence or slowness in implementing measures to correct the 
            problem and with failing to make full use of the capital investment 
            allotted for water protection measures. The authorities were given 
            until 1980 to implement the measures needed to ensure a complete end 
            to the discharge of untreated wastewater into the Volga-Ural river 
            basins. However, by the end of the 1980s, the pollution level of the 
            Volga and its tributaries was still assessed as 'extremely high', 
            and it continued to increase in the 1990s.</td>

      <p>Poor water quality impacts human health. In Europe, however, outbreaks 
        of water-borne diseases affecting less than 20 per cent of the supplied 
        population are rarely detected. Even so, occasional outbreaks of water-borne 
        diseases such as gastrointestinal infections, affecting much of the population, 
        are reported across Europe, even from countries with high standards of 
        supply (WHO 1999). Lead from old distribution pipes and, in Eastern Europe, 
        contaminated wells can affect the neuro-behavioural development of children 
        (EEA/WHO 1999).</p>
      <p>At sub-regional level, various EU Directives tackle water quality issues. 
        Implementation of the Drinking Water and Nitrate Directives has been unsatisfactory 
        in most member states, although the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive 
        has led to a decrease in organic matter discharges by two-thirds and in 
        nutrients by one-half (ETC/WTR 2001). Further improvements are likely 
        as more countries invest in new infrastructure to comply with the objectives 
        of the Directive. The same will be true for Accession Countries in Central 
        Europe.</p>
      <p>The mixed success of these measures can be related to the absence of 
        integrated policies for water management. Policy development currently 
        focuses on sustainable watershed management and freshwater protection 
        through integration of quantity and quality aspects. Integration may be 
        improved by the Water Framework Directive which aims to achieve good surface 
        water status in all European water bodies by 2015 and addresses the issue 
        of integrated management of water resources at the catchment level (EEA 
        1999a).</p>
