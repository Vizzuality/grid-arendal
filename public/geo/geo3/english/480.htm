      <p>Along with natural disasters, the region has been plagued with wars. 
        Since the beginning of the 20th century, the region has witnessed the 
        1948 Arab-Israeli war, the 1967 Six-Day war, the 1973 October war and 
        the Israeli invasion of Southern Lebanon in 1982. In the 1980s and 1990s, 
        the first and second Gulf wars caused major environmental problems. Environmental 
        pollution was a major impact. Fires were set deliberately in forests, 
        and water resources were polluted and/or destroyed. Artillery fire destroyed 
        land resources. Marine resources were polluted as well as the atmosphere 
        from oil well fires and soils were contaminated by oil spills during the 
        second Gulf War.</p>
      <p>Wars create refugees. In the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, 
        more than 750 000 Palestinians were left landless and homeless. A second 
        wave of approximately 350 000 Palestinians and more than 150 000 Syrians 
        became refugees at the end of the Six- Day War. Towns and villages in 
        Palestine and Golan Heights were depopulated and destroyed. Today, there 
        are about 3.8 million refugees in 59 camps registered with the United 
        Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA 2002). Palestinian refugees are 
        scattered in a number of countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. 
        Most live in poor conditions, putting additional stress on already limited 
        natural resources.</p>

            <p>Increases in nutrient concentrations in the Gulf have often been 
              concentrated in the Kuwait Bay and the area around the outfall of 
              the Shatt-Al-Arab river, and they have been cited as the cause of 
              a number of eutrophication incidents. A major red tide and an associated 
              fish kill occurred in 1999. The main conclusion of that incident 
              was that unless pollution levels were reduced drastically, eutrophication 
              conditions would worsen, causing more fish kills.</p>
            <p>The 1999 event was one of a series. In 1986, tonnes of fish as 
              well as other marine animals, including 527 dolphins, 7 dugongs, 
              58 turtles and more than 10 000 cuttle fish, had been found dead 
              along the shores of the Gulf. During 1990 and 1991, 137 sea turtles 
              were found dead along the Omani coast. In 1993, a fish kill was 
              observed two months after the sinking of a Russian merchant vessel 
              carrying chemicals. Similar phenomena were reported along the coasts 
              of Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab 
              Emirates between 1993 and 1998.</p>
            <p>Kuwait Bay has experienced a series of changes over the years, 
              including the release of both treated and untreated sewage and oils 
              and untreated wastes from sources connected directly to the storm 
              water network. Two commercial ports and several marinas, three power 
              stations, a commercial fish farm in the middle of the bay, and an 
              artificial river in Iraq into which sewage and agriculture run-off 
              from the newly drained marshes are released, exert pressure on the 
              bay.</p>
            <p>Another source of nutrients is wind-blown soil carried by the predominant 
              northwesterly winds, which has increased over the past few years 
              due to the shrinking marshlands in Iraq. The linkage between the 
              marshes and the Gulf through the Shatt Al-Arab and its tributaries 
              has allowed fish to migrate. In August-September 2001, more than 
              3 000 tonnes of fish, predominantly mullet, died. The pathogen identified, 
              Streptococcus iniae, could have originated from sewage or contaminated 
              fish-feed. The same species was reported in Bahrain in 1999 when 
              there was massive mortality in rabbitfish populations. The combined 
              effects of elimination of the Iraqi marshes as a natural wastewater 
              treatment system and the continued input of organic matter from 
              anthropogenic activities coupled with arid conditions have created 
              a recipe for disaster, transforming the Gulf into a soup ready to 
              provide a perfect media for bacterial and algal blooms.</p>
