      <p>The annual rate of change in total forest area (land with at least 10 
        per cent tree cover and 0.5 ha area) from 1990 to 2000 for the whole of 
        Africa was estimated to be -0.74 per cent, equivalent to losing more than 
        5 million ha of forest a year, an area roughly the size of Togo and the 
        highest rate of any region. Countries with the highest annual deforestation 
        rates are Burundi (9.0 per cent), Comoros (4.3 per cent), Rwanda (3.9 
        per cent) and Niger (3.7 per cent). In terms of area deforested during 
        1990-2000, Sudan tops the list with 9.6 million ha, followed by Zambia 
        (8.5 million ha), Democratic Republic of Congo (5.3 million ha), Nigeria 
        (4.0 million ha) and Zimbabwe (3.2 million ha). Only seven countries increased 
        their forest areas over the same period (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>Economic development strategies and lax implementation of forest protection 
        regulations are the principal pressures on forest resources. Governments 
        in Western and Central Africa have given concessions to private firms 
        for logging selected species. The timber is mostly exported to earn foreign 
        exchange. In countries such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo 
        and Sierra Leone political instability and war have further contributed 
        to deforestation. Forest clearance has negative economic impacts through 
        loss of future export opportunities, tourism revenue and pharmaceutical 
        development options. The annual cost of deforestation in Uganda has been 
        conservatively estimated at US$3-6 million (NEMA 2000). </p>
      <p>Weak and ineffective policies have contributed to forest clearance. In 
        Eastern Africa, for example, forestry departments throughout the 1980s 
        were given a low priority, resulting in weak or outdated policies, laws 
        and regulations governing forest management. In Southern Africa, most 
        forestry policies and laws were enacted in the 1970s, and have since become 
        obsolete with small and non-deterrent fines for non-compliance. Policy 
        failures in Western Africa include lack of attention to developing alternative 
        energy sources, inadequate funding of forestry departments, lack of support 
        for private investment in sustainable forest management and reforestation, 
        and out-dated concepts of forest conservation and community participation. 
        However, levels of awareness on forestry issues have been greatly raised 
        through international lobbying, extension services and the activities 
        of NGOs. Several countries are now correcting these institutional weaknesses, 
        and forest policies are being reviewed, revised or redrafted. Communities 
        have become more involved in policy making, as well as in implementing 
        forest management strategies. International cooperative initiatives have 
        been developed in Southern and Central Africa (FAO 2001b). </p>
      <p>Clearing of forests for agriculture has played a significant role in 
        deforestation. In Northern Africa, 13 per cent of forest cover was lost 
        during 1972-92, and in Nigeria deforestation of riparian forests and savannahs 
        for agricultural development was estimated at more than 470 000 ha a year 
        during 1978-96 (DoF Nigeria 1996). In Africa as a whole, 60 per cent of 
        the tropical forest cleared between 1990 and 2000 has been converted into 
        permanent agricultural smallholdings (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>Some large-scale reforestation programmes have been implemented but most 
        have introduced monocultures without the biological diversity of the natural 
        forests they replace. While some of the more arid countries have increased 
        the size of their forests, reforestation programmes have done little to 
        slow deforestation rates, particularly in moist tropical forests (ADB 
        2000, FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p> Another response has been to designate forests as protected areas. Some 
        11.7 per cent of African forests have protected area status (FAO 2001a). 
        While the establishment of protected areas has increased the availability 
        and quality of information on forest resources, promoted public awareness 
        and created refuges for endangered species, these areas will meet their 
        objectives only if protection measures are enforced (see box). </p>

            <p>In Mt Elgon National Park, on the Uganda/Kenya border, agricultural 
              encroachment in the 1970s and 1980s laid bare more than 25 000 ha 
              of virgin forest. In Kibale National Park, Uganda, encroachers cleared 
              more than 10 000 ha of forest. In Mabira Forest Reserve, the Kanani 
              Cooperative Farmers Society entered the forest in 1975. The district 
              administration perceived them as a self-help project rather than 
              as encroachers, and gave cultivation permits to 115 of their members. 
              The permits specified that no more forested land should be cleared, 
              valuable timber tree species should be preserved, and no buildings 
              should be erected. Regulations were not enforced and by 1981 more 
              than 1 800 people had moved in and degraded more than 7 200 ha of 
              the reserve. </p>
            <p>In Kenya, between 1995 and 2000, the whole of the indigenous forest 
              in the Imenti Forest Reserve on the slopes of Mt Kenya was illegally 
              converted into cropland. Designated as a forest reserve since 1932, 
              under which no clearance activities were permitted, forest policies 
              clearly failed to provide adequate protection. Landsat images below 
              show loss of forest (red); each image is about 20 km wide. </p>

      <p>Commercial forestry management has evolved towards a more sustainable 
        philosophy. The forest ecosystem is becoming the focus of management, 
        rather than timber extraction, and non-timber forest resources are given 
        consideration. In Southern Africa, there is a growing realization of the 
        importance of trade in forest products from sustainably managed forests, 
        and a small proportion of forests in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe 
        have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>Community-based forest management schemes are also being established, 
        with considerable benefits to community income levels and forest conservation. 
        In Eastern Africa, agroforestry schemes are being introduced to meet the 
        dual need for agricultural production and tree products from smallholdings. 
        In Kenya, afforestation and reforestation at household and commercial 
        scale have been able to supply people with fuelwood, poles, sawn wood, 
        wood-based panels, and pulp and paper. </p>
