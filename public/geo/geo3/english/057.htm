      <p>The 1990s were characterized by the search for increased understanding 
        of the concept and significance of sustainable development. This was accompanied 
        by accelerating trends towards globalization, particularly with regard 
        to trade and technology. The conviction grew that there were an increasing 
        number of global environmental problems that required international solutions. 
        The profile of environmental issues was also increasing in the South as 
        new organizations began demanding diagnoses and solutions for developing 
        countries. The Regional Environmental Centre was established in Hungary 
        in 1990 to address environmental issues in post-Soviet Central Europe. 
        There was significant action by private industry to put its house into 
        better environmental shape and explosive growth in the use of the Internet 
        and electronic communications.</p>
      <p>The decade started badly for the environment with the loss of thousands 
        of lives in the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict and a partial black-out over 
        some of the area as millions of barrels of oil were wilfully ignited (Bennett 
        1995). For West Asia, this was a major environmental catastrophe. An oil 
        slick - caused by the release of between 0.5 million to 11 million barrels 
        of crude oil - is reported to have killed 15 000-30 000 sea birds. In 
        addition, about 20 per cent of mangroves in the Persian Gulf were contaminated 
        and 50 per cent of coral reefs affected (Island Press 1999). The atmosphere 
        was not spared either: about 67 million tonnes of oil were burnt, producing 
        about 2.1 million tonnes of soot and 2 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide 
        (Bennett 1995).</p>

      <p><a name="fig14"></a>Elsewhere, while technical progress was transforming 
        industrialized society, few in the developing world were benefiting. The 
        death toll from infectious diseases (such as AIDS, malaria, respiratory 
        diseases and diarrhoea) was 160 times greater than the number killed in 
        1999 from natural disasters, including earthquakes in Turkey, floods in 
        Venezuela and cyclones in India (IFRC 2000). The International Federation 
        of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported that a 1995 survey of 
        53 countries showed a 15 per cent decline in health spending per person 
        following economic structural adjustment.</p>
      <p>By 1997, near the end of the 20th century, some 800 million people (nearly 
        14 per cent of the world population) not only went hungry every day but 
        also lacked the basic skills of reading and writing essential to sustainable 
        development (UNESCO 1997).</p>
      <p>In terms of governance, events of the late 1980s continued to influence 
        political developments across the globe. No region was immune as dictatorships 
        and military regimes in Africa and Latin America were voted out of power, 
        and the single party governments in some European countries were relegated 
        to opposition benches by a restless electorate. The people had begun to 
        exercise their right to elect their leaders and demand accountability. 
        Despite this radical change in terms of governance, there was little immediate 
        impact on the environment in most countries. In the countries of the former 
        Soviet Union, however, economic recession helped reduce waste emissions 
        and energy consumption. Whether such effects will prove only temporary 
        remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>At the institutional level, ideas that had taken shape during the late 
        1980s, such as multistakeholder participation and increased accountability 
        on environmental and social matters, were given a higher profile by a 
        number of international events. The first of these was a ministerial conference 
        on the environment held in Bergen, Norway, in May 1990, where such ideas 
        were first formally endorsed. This conference was convened to prepare 
        for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED or the Earth 
        Summit) that was held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
