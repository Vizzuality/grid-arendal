      <a name="fig288"></a>The disruption and intensification of the Earth's water 
      cycle is believed to be one of the most fundamental effects of climate change 
      (White House 2000). Changes may already be occurring in North America's 
      hydrological conditions, as demonstrated by the increase in average annual 
      precipitation over the past 30 years (see figure). In the United States, 
      the average amount of moisture in the atmosphere increased by 5 per cent 
      per decade between 1973 and 1993 (Trenberth 1999). Most of the increase 
      has been due to heavier precipitation events resulting in floods and storms 
      (O'Meara 1997, Easterling and others 2000). 
      <p>During the 1960s and 1970s, more than 90 per cent of the natural disasters 
        in the United States were the result of weather or climate extremes (Changnon 
        and Easterling 2000). Flooding is natural and essential to the health 
        of watersheds but floods can also be destructive and cause economic damage 
        (see box bellow). In response to these events, the United States introduced 
        the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the 1974 Disaster Relief 
        Act. Many of the separate and fragmented responsibilities of parallel 
        state and local level disaster programmes were merged in 1979 under the 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA 1999). In 1975, Canada introduced 
        the Flood Damage Reduction Program (FDRP) and, in 1988, it established 
        Emergency Preparedness Canada (EPC) (EC 2000). These programmes provided 
        better flood mitigation, preparation, response and recovery measures.</p>
      Evidence shows that deaths and damage from floods have increased sharply 
      since the early 1970s (USGRP 2000). More people and their settlements are 
      exposed tofloods because of population increase and concentration, and increasing 
      affluence (Easterling and others 2000). A tendency to settle in flood-prone 
      areas is also influenced by a perception that risk has been lowered by protective 
      structures such as dams, dykes and diversions, and because of the availability 
      of disaster relief (Brun and others 1997, Bruce and others 1999). 
      <p>Structures that prevent rivers from flooding often provoke extremely 
        damaging floods when water eventually overflows (see box below). In the 
        1990s, the United States, which is subject to more frequent and severe 
        weather events than Canada, began to encourage non-structural approaches 
        to flood prevention such as resettlement projects and wetland restoration. 
        In Canada, settlement in flood-prone areas has been discouraged through 
        mapping and the designation of more than 320 flood risk areas (EC 1998b). 
        Canada established the Office of Critical Infrastructure and Emergency 
        Preparedness (OCIPEP) in 2001 to develop and implement a more comprehensive 
        approach to disaster prevention (OCIPEP 2001).</p>

            <p>The 1993 Mississippi flood, which submerged 75 towns and killed 
              48 people, cost US$10-20 billion, surpassing all previous US floods 
              in terms of economic losses, area, duration and amount of flooding 
              (Dalgish 1998, USGCRP 2000). It was the result of record-breaking 
              spring rains in the midwest, a larger than usual snow cover, and 
              high soil moisture content - but levees and dykes also confined 
              the river to its channel, helping increase the flood crest (Dalgish 
              1998). In 1996, Canada experienced its most destructive and costly 
              flood in the Saguenay River valley in Quebec. Nearly 126 mm of rain 
              fell in 48 hours, resulting in 10 deaths and about US$750 million 
              in damages (EC 1998b, Francis and Hengeveld 1998, EC 2001). In 1997, 
              the Red River, which flows north from the United States into Canada, 
              experienced its worst flooding in 150 years, incurring costs of 
              almost US$5 billion (IJC 2000).</p>
            <p>Floods can have significant environmental consequences. The Mississippi 
              flood, for example, damaged much of the midwest's fertile farmland 
              and altered the natural ecosystems of the region's rivers and their 
              floodplains (Dalgish 1998). Human modifications over the past century 
              led to the loss of some 85 per cent of the river basin's wetlands, 
              and changes in riparian and in-stream habitat. Wetlands and temporary 
              lakes act as storage areas for excess water and their loss increases 
              the vulnerability of the watershed to flooding (Searchinger and 
              Tripp 1993).</p>

      <p>According to some climate change models, the magnitude, frequency and 
        cost of extreme hydrological events in some regions of North America are 
        forecast to increase (USGCRP 2000). Projected effects of climate change 
        include changes in the El Niño. An uncommonly strong El Niño in 1997-98 
        is believed to account for heavy floods in Florida, California, some midwest 
        states and parts of New England (Trenberth 1999). Where rainstorms intensify 
        and flooding increases, there is greater potential for damage to lowlying 
        settlements and dock and port facilities as well as for problems with 
        water distribution and sewage systems that can have health implications 
        (EC 1999a).</p>
      <p>The International Joint Commission assists both governments in managing 
        their shared waters. In a report on the 1997 Red River flooding, it cautioned 
        that, given impending increased flooding due to climate change, a comprehensive, 
        binational strategy should be developed and implemented (IJC 2000).</p>
