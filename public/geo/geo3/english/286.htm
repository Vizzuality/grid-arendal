      <p>Over the years, water pollution has emerged as a major issue. Pollutants 
        include pathogens, organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals and toxic chemicals, 
        sediments and suspended solids, silt and salts.</p>
      <p>South Asia - particularly India - and Southeast Asia are facing severe 
        water pollution problems. Rivers such as the Yellow (China), Ganges (India), 
        and Amu and Syr Darya (Central Asia) top the list of the world's most 
        polluted rivers (World Commission on Water 1999). In cities in the developing 
        countries of the region, most water bodies are now heavily polluted with 
        domestic sewage, industrial effluents, chemicals and solid wastes. Most 
        rivers in Nepal's urban areas have been polluted and their waters are 
        now unfit for human use, while drinking water in Kathmandu is contaminated 
        with coliform bacteria, iron, ammonia and other contaminants (UNEP 2001).</p>
      <p>Water pollution has affected human health. In the Pacific Islands, especially 
        in some atoll communities, use of polluted groundwater for drinking and 
        cooking has led to health problems such as diarrhoea, hepatitis, and occasional 
        outbreaks of typhoid and cholera. Groundwater in districts of West Bengal, 
        India, and in some villages in Bangladesh, for example, is contaminated 
        with arsenic at levels as much as 70 times higher than the national drinking 
        water standard of 0.05 mg/litre. While pollution is a factor, arsenic 
        contamination is also due to natural phenomena. According to one report, 
        'With the majority of the country's 68 000 villages potentially at risk, 
        UN scientists estimate that the arsenic may soon be killing 20 000 Bangladeshis 
        a year' (Pierce 2001).</p>

      <p><a name="fig162"></a>Inadequate water supply and poor sanitation cause 
        more than 500 000 infant deaths a year as well as a huge burden of illness 
        and disability in the region UNEP 1999). Some 8-9 per cent of the total 
        Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are due to diseases related to 
        inadequate water supply and poor sanitation in India and other countries 
        (World Bank 2000). Cholera is prevalent in many countries, particularly 
        those where sanitation facilities are poor such as Afghanistan, China 
        and India (WHO 2000).</p>
      <p>Of the global population without access to improved sanitation or water 
        supply, most live in Asia WHO and UNICEF 2000, see map left). In the Southwest 
        Pacific sub-region, water supply and sanitation appear to be relatively 
        good, with 93 per cent of the population having access to improved sanitation 
        and 88 per cent to improved water supply (WHO and UNICEF 2000). These 
        figures are strongly biased by the large and well-served population of 
        Australia, however. Only an estimated 48 per cent of the Asian population 
        has sanitation coverage (WHO and UNICEF 2000) - less than in any other 
        region of the world. The situation is worse in rural areas, where only 
        31 per cent of the population have improved sanitation, compared to 78 
        per cent coverage in urban areas.</p>
      <p>During the past decade, several countries have started to address the 
        water quality problem by implementing large-scale programmes and action 
        plans to rehabilitate degraded streams and depleted aquifers. These programmes 
        are typically given legislative or statutory authority such as that provided 
        by Thailand's National Water Quality Act, the Philippine Water Quality 
        Code, India's Environment Protection Act, China's Water Law and the Republic 
        of Korea's Water Quality Preservation Act (UNESCAP 1999). Success stories 
        with respect to rehabilitation and protection of water quality of rivers 
        come from those countries where water policies promote a multisectoral 
        and multidisciplinary approach to the management of water resources.</p>

          <td>In Australia, the quality of water in many inland waterways has 
            declined due to human activities within catchments (Ball and others 
            2001). Sediments, nutrients and toxic materials as well as excessive 
            growth of aquatic weeds have affected aquatic ecosystems. Response 
            measures include the Urban Storm Water Initiative, the Industry Partnership 
            Programme and Waterwatch Australia that together aim to monitor and 
            improve the health of urban waterways. A number of state and territory-based 
            programmes have also been introduced, together with community programmes 
            such as Streamwatch and Waterwatch. In addition, local authorities 
            are developing storm water management plans for urban catchments with 
            financial support from state and territory agencies. Storm water is 
            increasingly seen as a resource to be collected and utilized rather 
            than a waste for disposal.</td>

      <p>Clean-up campaigns for rivers, canals, lakes and other water bodies have 
        become widespread. The programmes have often been successful in improving 
        water quality and, occasionally, have led to the adoption of new water 
        quality standards and water use regulations. They have also increased 
        awareness of the need to reduce pollutant loads through wastewater treatment, 
        reuse and recycling of sewage and industrial wastewater, introduction 
        of low-cost technologies, and strict control of industrial and municipal 
        effluent. There have been a number of successes in water reuse and recycling 
        in the industrialized countries of the region.</p>
      <p>Water quality has been improved in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea 
        and Singapore as a result of initiatives to address water pollution. In 
        Japan, the government has set environmental quality standards and made 
        remarkable improvements: in 1991, 99.8 per cent of water samples met standards 
        for heavy metals and toxins in Japan (RRI 2000). In 2000, the rate of 
        industrial wastewater treatment across China was 94.7 per cent (SEPA 2001). 
        Action in Singapore means that Singaporeans can now enjoy drinkable piped 
        water straight from the tap.</p>
