      <p>Water availability varies greatly, with South America being the richest 
        sub-region. Some countries suffer from water shortages, and loss of aquatic 
        biodiversity and habitats, with some Caribbean islands approaching or 
        below water scarcity levels (WWC 2000). Sharp differences also exist within 
        countries.</p>
      <p>In most Caribbean small island states, rainfall is the sole source of 
        freshwater (Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas and Barbados use desalinated 
        water). In South America, groundwater reserves are of great importance 
        and are estimated at 3 million km<sup>3</sup> (GWP 2000). Mexico is particularly 
        dependent on groundwater, which accounts for one-third of all reported 
        freshwater extraction and for two-thirds of urban drinking water (CATHALAC 
        1999, WWC 1999).</p>

      <a name="fig167"></a>Agriculture and industry are the major consumers of 
      water in the region, followed by domestic consumption. Irrigated agriculture 
      is one of the fastest expanding uses of freshwater. The amount of land under 
      irrigated agriculture increased from 10 million ha in 1970 to more than 
      18 million ha in 1998 (FAOSTAT 2001). Water withdrawals for irrigation range 
      from 56 per cent of total withdrawals in the Caribbean to 78 per cent in 
      Mesoamerica. There is a general lack of efficiency in irrigation technology 
      and practice (World Bank 1999). Some recent institutional reforms have attempted 
      to address this. In Mexico, for example, ownership of public irrigation 
      systems has been transferred to 386 Water User Associations resulting in 
      a dramatic improvement in cost recovery, system maintenance, yield and water 
      use efficiency (Saleth and Dinar 1999).
<p>Industry also uses large amounts of water. In South America, it is estimated 
        that annual industrial withdrawals reach 15 km<sup>3</sup> with 80 per 
        cent of this demand coming from Argentina and Brazil alone (ACAA 2001). 
        In Brazil, virtually all the country's electricity comes from hydropower. 
        The mining sector, especially in Chile and Peru, requires increasing quantities 
        of water. For some regions such as the Andes, this may well lead to the 
        need to import water in the near future. In Venezuela and Trinidad and 
        Tobago, the petroleum sector is an important consumer.</p>
      <p>The demand for water for domestic use is also on the increase. However, 
        inequity among users, even in water-rich countries, is rampant. Many of 
        the poor in both rural areas and urban communities have neither access 
        to clean water nor sanitation services (WWC 2000). In 1995, 27 per cent 
        of the population had either no domestic water supply or no easy access 
        to it. In the same year, 41 per cent of the water was untreated and 31 
        per cent of the population had no sewage services (PAHO 1998). By 2000, 
        85 per cent of the population had an improved water supply and 78 per 
        cent had improved sanitation coverage - but this still meant that 78 million 
        people had no access to improved water supply and 117 million had no access 
        to improved sanitation services (WHO and UNICEF 2000). Large disparities 
        also exist between rural and urban areas. Natural disasters provide an 
        additional, unexpected factor that can seriously undermine efforts to 
        improve water and sanitation services.</p>

      <p>Attempts have been made to improve water supply and sanitation in many 
        urban areas and to set tariffs that reflect the real value of water. Although 
        the efficiency of privatization and the use of economic instruments such 
        as water pricing remain highly contentious (WWC 2000), some countries, 
        such as Jamaica, have started using economic instruments (UNECLAC 2000).</p>
      <p>Limited information on water utility infrastructure and operation is 
        a major constraint in government efforts to improve regulations related 
        to the urban water sector. While the role of governments has shifted from 
        provider of a water service to regulator representing the public, many 
        governments still do not have sufficient information on water utility 
        operation, and this limits their regulatory functions. Although the rate 
        of technological change in the water sector is generally slower than in 
        other sectors, the need to transfer technology is critical to efforts 
        to save water and introduce improved control strategies.</p>
      <p>To increase the efficiency of the sanitation sector, as well as to attract 
        capital, national and international initiatives have been suggested, including 
        the creation of local or regional markets such as the Guarani Aquifer 
        project (see box below). In Brazil, there have been notable advances in 
        legislation, especially with a 1997 federal law that put in place a national 
        water resources policy and established a national water resources management 
        system.</p>

            <p>The Guarani Aquifer System is one of the world's largest aquifers, 
              covering about 1.2 million km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast of South 
              America. The permanent reserves of the system in Brazil are conservatively 
              estimated at about 48 000 km<sup>3</sup> with an annual recharge 
              of 160 km<sup>3</sup>. Groundwater extraction of about 20 per cent 
              of current annual recharge rates would be enough to supply 300 litres 
              per day per capita to 360 million inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are working together to 
              develop an integrated plan for the protection and sustainable management 
              of the system under a project funded by the Global Environment Facility 
              and the World Bank - the Project for Environmental Protection and 
              Sustainable Development of the Guarani Aquifer System. The Organization 
              of American States, other international donors and agencies are 
              also participating. Success would be an important step towards ensuring 
              long-term availability of freshwater and aquifer resources for people 
              in these countries.</p>

            <p>Community participation, a cost-sharing and cost-recovery system, 
              hygiene education and training have contributed to improving water 
              supply and sanitation in many peri-urban communities in the Honduran 
              capital of Tegucigalpa. Rapid urbanization over the past 20 years 
              increased Tegucigalpa's population to 850 000, with more than half 
              of the people living in 225 peri-urban communities. Surface water 
              is almost non-existent, and groundwater is often too deep and polluted. 
              The provision of basic services such as water and sewage systems 
              is difficult and costly.</p>
            <p>The programme on water supply for peri-urban settlements, which 
              is a partnership involving UNICEF, with the National Autonomous 
              Water and Sewage Authority (SANAA) Executive Unit for Settlements 
              in Development (UEBD) and communities, provided water supply to 
              150 000 people in 80 communities and sanitation coverage to about 
              5 000 in four communities between 1987 and 1996. One of the strengths 
              of the programme is community participation and investment. The 
              community has to provide labour and construction materials, contribute 
              financially through water tariffs and recover the full investment 
              cost. The community must establish a Water Board to collect tariffs, 
              administer the water system and take care of the operation and simple 
              maintenance activities. A cost-sharing and cost-recovery system 
              exists and this includes the use of a revolving fund: the community's 
              contribution is about 40 per cent of the cost of the water system, 
              while SANAA and UNICEF contribute 25 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.</p>
