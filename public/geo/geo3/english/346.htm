      <p>Nutrient inputs to marine and coastal ecosystems have increased dramatically 
        over the past three decades due to large increases in population density, 
        fossil fuel use, sewage inputs, livestock production and fertilizer use 
        (EC 2000). These activities release nitrogen and phosphorus, which can 
        enhance plant growth in aquatic systems and lead to oxygen depletion and 
        multiple effects on the ecosystem including destroyed fish habitat, coastal 
        pollution and harmful algal blooms (EC 1999, 2000).</p>
      <p>In many parts of North America, nutrients from non-point sources come 
        mainly from fertilizer and manure run-off. Over the past 30 years, fertilizer 
        use has increased by almost 30 per cent while a trend towards rearing 
        livestock in intensive feedlots has led to the release of large amounts 
        of manure to surface and coastal waters (Mathews and Hammond 1999). Atmospheric 
        inputs of nitrogen derived from manure, as well as from vehicles and electric 
        utility power plants, are also significant (NOAA 1998a).</p>
      <p>Since the early 1970s, anti-pollution legislation has greatly reduced 
        point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus, principally from the discharge 
        of municipal sewage and industrial wastes and the control of phosphates 
        in laundry detergents (NOAA 1998a, EC 2000). However, most municipal wastewater 
        discharged into Canada's coastal waters is still either untreated or only 
        partially treated (EC 2000). Canadian estuaries in the North Atlantic 
        are less severely affected by nutrient loading than more southerly ones 
        due in part to a cooler climate and significant flushing of coastal waters 
        (NOAA 1998b). Along the north Atlantic coast, non-point sources of nitrogen 
        are some ninefold greater than inputs from wastewater treatment plants 
        (EC 2000).</p>
      <p>In 1998, more than 60 per cent of US coastal rivers and bays were moderately 
        to severely degraded by nutrient contamination, and nitrogen was found 
        to be the single greatest environmental threat in some 'trouble' spots 
        on the Atlantic coast (NOAA 1998b, Howarth and others 2000). The US Clean 
        Water Act and the 1972 Coastal Zone Management Act directed states to 
        develop management plans for non-point contamination sources and provided 
        funding and incentives to implement them (NRC 2000). The 1987 US National 
        Estuary Program aims to minimize regional nutrient contamination (see 
        box).</p>

          <td>The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Program was set up under the US National 
            Estuary Program. It is a federal-state-local partnership to reduce 
            nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the Bay by 40 per cent. This region 
            has a population of more than 15 million people, and important commercial 
            fish and shellfish harvests, and is a major stopover for migratory 
            birds. By the late 1990s, only the phosphorus reduction goal had been 
            met. Progress in reducing nutrients is being hampered by population 
            growth and development.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Nutrient enrichment is probably a contributing factor in the recent dramatic 
        increase in the intensity, frequency and spatial extent of algal blooms 
        or red tides, causing increased economic losses and health impacts. The 
        number of coastal and estuarine locations in the United States with major 
        recurring incidents of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) doubled between 1972 
        and 1995 (US Senate 1997).</p>
      <p>The impacts of HABs can include human illness and death from eating contaminated 
        fish or shellfish, mass mortalities of wild and farmed fish, and changes 
        in marine food webs. In response to incidents of human illness from contaminated 
        shellfish, both Canada and the United States have developed testing and 
        water quality programmes to identify phytoplankton toxins and to provide 
        information about them to the public.</p>
      <p>Ocean acts in both countries (1997 in Canada and 2000 in the United States) 
        establish frameworks for improving the stewardship of North America's 
        coastal and ocean waters (EC 1999). Since 1996, the North American Commission 
        for Environmental Cooperation has been facilitating regional implementation 
        of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
        from Land-based Activities in North America (CEC 2000b).</p>
      <p>As yet, there is no regional strategy to address nutrient loading in 
        North America's coastal waters, and coordination among the various agencies 
        responsible for their management is inadequate (NRC 2000). Evidence suggests 
        that the situation can be reversed, but the need remains for increased 
        political action and changes in the activities in the watersheds and airsheds 
        that feed coastal streams and rivers.</p>
