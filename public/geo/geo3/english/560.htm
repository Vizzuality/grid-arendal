      <p>At the same time as infrastructure is expanding, changing climate affects 
        biodiversity, resulting in significant reductions in the quantity and 
        quality of natural capital in some sub-regions over the next 30 years. 
        As with other pressures, these differ significantly across the sub-regions, 
        with the most significant pressures on biodiversity occurring in South 
        and Southeast Asia under all scenarios (see above).</p>
      <p>Finally, increases in trade affect biodiversity, particularly in the 
        worlds of <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Policy First</i>. Under <i>Security 
        First </i>conditions, reductions in trade and greater control of the exploitation 
        of particular areas may actually benefit biodiversity in these areas, 
        whereas other areas suffer from lack of control.</p>
      <p>Some of these pressures on biodiversity are countered in a <i>Policy 
        First </i>world by regional cooperation to reduce illegal extraction and 
        establish more protected areas. In a world of <i>Sustainability First</i>, 
        advances in technology enable real-time identification and monitoring 
        of biodiversity assets and sensitive ecosystems. Communities are better 
        equipped with knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of environmental 
        systems, tools for strategic assessment and planning. Over time this results 
        in a greater representation of species, communities and genes within protected 
        areas. Maintenance of endemic genetic stocks provides valuable source 
        materials for biotechnology advances, captures benefits for local communities 
        and reduces opportunities for invasive species to take over.</p>

      <p>Relevant environmental trends, along with the distribution of economic 
        growth and effectiveness of social policies, are reflected in the incidence 
        of hunger in the region (see charts above). The percentage of people experiencing 
        hunger remains high in much of the region in <i>Markets First </i>and 
        <i>Security First</i>. With growing populations, this implies only slight 
        reductions in absolute numbers in the former and small increases in the 
        latter. Dramatic improvements are possible, though, as seen in the <i>Policy 
        First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>results where there are steep 
        reductions in both the percentage and the total hungry. In the <i>Policy 
        First </i>scenario this is achieved through a combination of relatively 
        high growth and more equitable income distribution. In the <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>scenario it comes about as greater equity both between and within 
        countries is reflected in rapid economic growth and a narrowing of income 
        distributions.</p>

            <p>Rapidly growing populations and economies escalate demand for food

              More irrigation and fertilizer use in rural areas, together with 
              unimpeded growth of urban centres and mega-cities, mean more competition 
              for water resources between geographic regions and economic sectors. 
              This rivalry reaches crisis proportions around 2010, when the quality 
              of surface and ground waters across the region begins to go into 
              widespread, rapid and accelerating decline. The surface water changes 
              are a reaction by aquatic ecosystems to the cumulative loading of 
              nitrogen and other organic materials from inadequately treated agricultural 
              and municipal solid waste. The impacts on groundwater arise from 
              the run-off of chemical fertilizers and pesticides from agriculture 
              as well as toxic materials from industry. The effect is enhanced 
              by the more rapid extraction of groundwater resources, resulting 
              in a further increase in the concentration of these pollutants in 
              the remaining groundwater as well as increased rates of salt water

              It can often take crisis situations to induce necessary changes 
              that lead to more sustainable practices. In any case, coping with 
              issues such as freshwater quantity and quality requires an integrated 
              perspective that recognizes interactions between sectors and the 
              potential for threshold effects in natural systems from cumulative 
              pressures. Part of this shift involves encouraging diversity in 
              agricultural and other economic systems so that when surprises and 
              crises occur, a versatile repertoire enables new strategies to be 
              formed.</p>
