      <p>The Arctic land mass is approximately 14 million km<sup>2</sup> (AMAP 
        1997), of which the Russian Federation and Canada account for nearly 80 
        per cent, the Nordic countries for around 16 per cent and the United States 
        about 4 per cent (CAFF 1994).</p>
      <p>The Arctic consists of three main sub-systems:</p>
      <ul class="polar">
        <li>the high polar desert in eastern Canada, which comprises mainly bare 
          soils and rocks with sparse plant communities;</li>
        <li>the tundra, which is a vast, open plain with continuous low vegetation 
          cover; and</li>
        <li>the forest-tundra, which is the transition zone that parallels the 
          boreal forest to the south, and consists of patches of continuous forest 
          cover interspersed with tundra-like open areas (CAFF 2001).</li>

      <p><a name="fig87"></a>Besides its living resources, the Arctic contains 
        huge deposits of oil, gas and minerals. In the Arctic regions of North 
        America, there has been a recent upsurge of mining and associated infrastructural 
        development. Likewise, in the Russian Federation - a country which covers 
        12.6 per cent of the Earth's land surface - much land has been seriously 
        degraded by mineral extraction, forestry, fires, air pollution or conversion 
        to agriculture, and erosion is widespread and increasing. In recent years, 
        approximately 70 million ha of tundra have been degraded through destruction 
        of soil and vegetative cover, resulting from prospecting, mineral development, 
        vehicular movement, construction and, at certain locations, overgrazing 
        by reindeer (OECD 1999).</p>
      <p>The Russian Federation has established a solid legislative and regulatory 
        base to respond to these threats. Unfortunately, implementation is not 
        guaranteed due to the decline in the Russian economy, especially since 
        1998. Without an infusion of financial support to implement and enforce 
        the legislative regime, the environmental situation will continue to decline 
        (OECD 1999).</p>
      <p>Along with increased resource exploitation, construction of roads and 
        other infrastructure is also changing the face of the Arctic landscape.</p>
      <p>In Norway, for example, the area of undisturbed land has been reduced 
        from 48 per cent in 1900 to 11.8 per cent in 1998. Norway is taking political 
        action and is now placing increased emphasis on preservation of wilderness 
        areas and to avoid piecemeal development (Nellemann and others 2001).</p>
      <p>Tourism is growing in the Arctic and is already an important component 
        of the economies of the north although it is still in its infancy in northern 
        Russia. In 2000, more than 1.5 million people visited the Arctic (CAFF 
        2001). There are concerns, however, that tourism is promoting environmental 
        degradation by putting extra pressures on land, wildlife, water and other 
        basic necessities, and on transportation facilities.</p>
      <p>Erosion is a serious problem in parts of the Arctic. It is caused by 
        thawing, removal of ground cover and deforestation. In Iceland, for example, 
        more than onehalf of the vegetation and soil cover has been lost since 
        the island was colonized by humans, especially in the interior, as a result 
        of deforestation and overgrazing.</p>
      <p>Arctic country governments have taken some action to protect their land 
        base. Approximately 15 per cent of the Arctic land mass is protected, 
        although nearly 50 per cent of the protected area is classified as Arctic 
        desert or glacier - the least productive part of the Arctic and the one 
        with the lowest biodiversity and habitat values (CAFF 2001).</p>
