      <p>As a result of habitat conversion and loss, 31 of the 178 ecoregions 
        in the region are in a critical state of conservation, 51 are endangered 
        and 55 are vulnerable (Dinerstein and others 1995). Most endangered ecoregions 
        are found in the northern and central Andes, Central America, the steppe 
        and winter rainfall areas of the southern cone, the Cerrado and other 
        dry forests south of the Amazon basin, and the Caribbean (Dinerstein and 
        others 1995). Myers and others (2000) located 7 of the world's 25 hot 
        spots (where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing 
        exceptional loss of habitat) in the region.</p>
      <p>The Neotropics possess 6 of the 12 countries in the world where globally 
        threatened bird species are concentrated, with Brazil and Colombia having 
        the highest numbers in this category (BirdLife International 2000). Together, 
        Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Mexico account for more than 75 per cent of 
        threatened bird species in the Americas (BirdLife International 2000).</p>

      <a name="fig137"></a>Cloud forests and other humid montane forests have 
      been identified as one of the most threatened habitat types in the region. 
      They are found where persistent cloud cover is in contact with the mountainside, 
      at altitudes of 1 000-3 000 metres and play a critical role in the provision 
      of clean water supplies to human populations in the lowlands. Humid montane 
      forests also harbour the wild relatives and gene pools of many New World 
      crops, including potatoes, maize and beans (Debouck and Libros Ferla 1995). 
      <p>The principal pressures on cloud forests are clearance for subsistence 
        and commercial agriculture by rural communities, and in some regions for 
        plantations of narcotics. Human population growth and poverty drive these 
        processes but the construction of roads and increased links to commercial 
        markets has also stimulated the production of cash crops. Other major 
        pressures include deforestation for cattle ranching, which in the past 
        has often been supported by government policies.</p>
      <p>Lowland tropical rainforests have been the focus of particular conservation 
        concern, being the habitat with the highest species richness and with 
        continuing conversion of major areas to other land uses. The Brazilian 
        Amazon is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, which once had 
        a forested area of 4 million km<sup>2</sup>. By 1998, 86.3 per cent of 
        this area remained, with 377 200 km<sup>2</sup> cleared during the preceding 
        20 years (Fearnside 1999). The mean rate of forest clearing accelerated 
        in the 1990s, and the total area affected by fragmentation, clearing and 
        edge effects is now estimated to comprise one-third of the Brazilian Amazon 
        (Laurance 1998).</p>
      <p>Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is driven by several processes. 
        A major pressure is the ten-fold population growth in the region since 
        1960 (Goodman and Hall 1990). In addition, industrial logging and mining 
        and their associated networks of roads, which make accessible new areas 
        of forest to colonizers and ranchers, have been major factors in deforestation. 
        Some 6 per cent of the region falls within the strictly protected category. 
        Major efforts have been made in the field of timber certification and 
        forest preservation to reverse the loss of biodiversity (UNEP-ECLAC 2001). 
        Human-ignited fires have also become widespread, especially in logged 
        and fragmented areas (Laurance 1998).</p>
      <p>The forests of eastern coastal Brazil are considered among the most endangered 
        habitats on earth and have been given highest priority for biodiversity 
        conservation (Bibby and others 1992). They contain 7 000 endemic plants 
        and 779 endemic vertebrates - 2.7 and 2.1 per cent of the global total, 
        respectively (Myers and others 2000). In the Bahia region, only 0.4 per 
        cent of continuous forest cover remains of the original forest area of 
        215 436 km<sup>2</sup> (Mendonça and others 1994). Threats arise from 
        coastal development and uncontrolled logging, agriculture and charcoal 
        production.</p>
      <p>Overall, more than 10 per cent of the region is currently protected (see 
        graphic below). In addition, the attractiveness of the cloud forests and 
        recognition of their values by concerned individuals has led to the creation 
        of many private forest reserves in the region, often linked to scientific 
        research programmes and ecotourism ventures. A related trend in the 1990s 
        has been the creation of community-managed montane forest reserves.</p>
      <p>A new approach to promoting montane forest conservation in the region 
        is to compensate forest owners for the environmental services their forests 
        provide to society, often financed by the collection of a small surcharge 
        on the users of water originating in the forests. Such schemes are being 
        considered in several Latin American countries and have been tested in 
        Costa Rica (Campos and Calvo 2000). Many forest conservation initiatives 
        have been developed in the Amazon, including land-use planning, the establishment 
        of protected areas linked by corridors and extractive and Amerindian reserves. 
        The largest of these is the Pilot Programme to Conserve the Brazilian 
        Rainforest, with support from the G-7 nations. However, further major 
        infrastructure, industrial agriculture, mining and logging projects are 
        currently planned for the Amazon (Laurance and others 2001).</p>

      <a name="fig138"></a>The CBD has played an important role in terms of the 
      response to biodiversity loss. While some countries have incorporated the 
      CBD's objectives in general legislation, others have done so by means of 
      sectoral laws. The former group includes Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru 
      and Venezuela. For example, Brazil established a National Programme on Biological 
      Diversity in 1994 together with an accompanying project for the conservation 
      and sustainable use of Brazilian biological diversity (PROBIO), identifying 
      priority conservation areas and actions through a series of assessments. 
      In Peru, the Law for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological 
      Diversity, which covers most CBD commitments, entered into force in 1997. 
      It is expected that the nine Caribbean countries now preparing national 
      strategies on biodiversity will implement the CBD by means of legislation, 
      development of institutional mechanisms and by providing adequate resources 
      (UNEP 2000). Countries that are modifying their sectoral laws include Cuba, 
      Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama. However, legislation for the implementation 
      of the CBD has often been developed without reference to other biodiversityrelated 
      conventions such as CITES, the Convention on Migratory Species and Ramsar.
<p>National funding programmes such as the Mexican Fund for Nature Conservation 
        have been established as part of national efforts to implement the CBD. 
        Additional sources of funding include organizations such as the World 
        Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, together with other international 
        agencies, NGOs and bilateral cooperation agencies.</p>
      <p>Between 1988 and 1999, the World Bank Group approved 74 biodiversity 
        projects in the region which were declared consistent with the goals and 
        objectives of the CBD. A substantial amount (more than US$700 million) 
        has been distributed among regional efforts to conserve biodiversity, 
        especially since 1995. As expected, most of the resources went to the 
        largest countries. Brazil alone received 56 per cent of the total but 
        this benefit has not been equally distributed among ecosystems, the majority 
        going to the Amazon and Atlantic rainforests.</p>
