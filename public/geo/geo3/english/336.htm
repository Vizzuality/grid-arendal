      <p>Global, regional and national measures are being taken to reduce the 
        input of polluting substances into marine waters. International agreements 
        such as OSPAR, HELCOM and the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) provide 
        a binding legal framework. In the OSPAR and Baltic Sea areas, for example, 
        targets have been set to reduce emissions, losses and discharges of hazardous 
        wastes with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations near background 
        values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for synthetic 
        substances by 2020 (HELCOM 1998).</p>
      <p>Some states have difficulties in implementing their obligations under 
        these agreements, and this reduces the effectiveness of regional MEAs 
        such as MAP and the Black Sea Convention. Assistance programmes from wealthier 
        states may play an important role in improving implementation and compliance 
        in relation to regional and sub-regional MEAs.</p>
      <p>Enforcement has improved significantly in some CEE countries, and the 
        introduction of economic instruments has had an impact. For example, the 
        European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has made funding 
        available for infrastructure improvements in the transition countries 
        in cooperation with HELCOM. However, the slow transformation of large, 
        polluting, state-owned enterprises continues to present obstacles.</p>
      <p>The recently adopted European Water Framework Directive provides a strong 
        instrument for the control of pollutants and monitoring in the catchment 
        and coastal areas and improvement of water quality for all EU States and 
        incoming accession States.</p>
      <p>A recent example of a non-binding agreement at the global level is the 
        Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
        from Landbased Activities (GPA). Its implementation will require new forms 
        of collaboration between governments, organizations and institutions concerned 
        with marine and coastal areas at all levels - national, regional and global. 
        Although still in its early stages, the interest and commitment shown 
        by governments in Europe are encouraging.</p>
      <p>The main challenge in coastal areas is the implementation of Integrated 
        Coastal Zone Management which aims at harmonizing the various, sometimes 
        conflicting, uses of the coastal zone. In regions such as the Baltic Sea, 
        bordered by several independent nations, transboundary and international 
        cooperation is a basic requirement.</p>

            <p>The main principles for international cooperation in preparedness 
              for and response to marine pollution incidents are defined by the 
              Emergency Protocol to the Barcelona Convention. In order to assist 
              coastal states in its implementation, the Regional Marine Pollution 
              Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea (REMPEC) was 
              established in Malta in 1976. Since 1977, REMPEC has systematically 
              collected reports on incidents causing or likely to cause pollution 
              of the sea by oil. Some 311 incidents were recorded between August 
              1977 and December 2000, 156 of which actually resulted in the spillage 
              of oil. Spill response operations in the Mediterranean between 1981 
              and 2000 were regularly conducted either by national or local authorities 
              or by the spill clean-up contractors under their supervision. To 
              date, nearly 2 000 people have participated in a training programme 
              developed by REMPEC to assist coastal states in developing their 
              own capabilities for effective responses to pollution incidents. 
              The only case that necessitated mutual assistance between neighbouring 
              countries (France and Italy) was the spill from the tanker Haven 
              near Genoa in Italy, with the loss of 144 000 tonnes of oil in 1991.</p>
