      <p>Air pollution levels in the most populated cities are amongst the highest 
        in the world, producing serious human health impacts and affecting aquatic 
        and terrestrial ecosystems. Transport is a significant, often major, source 
        of urban air pollution. The other sources include industrial emissions, 
        burning of solid and liquid fuels for power generation, and burning of 
        biomass and other fuels such as charcoal for household use. In a few cities, 
        pollution levels have decreased. For example, in Japan, high fuel prices, 
        technological advances and strict standards have reduced SO<sub>2</sub> 
        and particulate emissions, and eliminated lead emissions from transport. 
        However, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in Tokyo and Osaka have not declined 
        sufficiently because of an increasing number of vehicles. This situation 
        is common in cities with growing levels of private transport (UN-ESCAP/ADB 
        2000).</p>

      <p><a name="fig221"></a>Traffic has become a major air polluter in the big 
        cities, although most Asian countries have low per capita vehicle ownership 
        in comparison to the world average (World Bank 2000). However, the motorized 
        fleet (see bar chart) has been growing rapidly; for example, the number 
        of private motor vehicles in Sri Lanka doubled during 1975-92 (Government 
        of Sri Lanka 1994) and in India the number of cars has been doubling every 
        seven years for the past 30 years (ADB 1999). This fact, combined with 
        poor roads, fuel quality and vehicle maintenance, makes vehicular air 
        pollution an alarming issue.</p>
      <p>Many countries have developed their own air quality standards for principal 
        pollutants as well as emission standards for power plants, selected industries 
        and vehicles. To reduce pollution, many countries have introduced unleaded 
        petrol, mandatory catalytic converters and low sulphur motor fuels. Alternative 
        technologies such as electric vehicles and compressed natural gas operated 
        vehicles are also being considered, especially in India and the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran. Tax incentives for gas or battery operated vehicles 
        have been introduced in Nepal and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Except for developed countries of the Northeast Asian and parts of the 
        South Pacific sub-regions, concern over the environment began to create 
        a demand for improved environmental protection in the 1980s. The 1990s 
        have seen significant progress in establishing the institutions and policy 
        tools needed to address urgent environmental problems. However, continuous 
        growth in energy consumption and reliance on fuels such as coal and oil 
        with a relatively high carbon content will inevitably increase emissions 
        unless more aggressive policies are introduced.</p>

            Of the 15 cities in the world with the highest levels of particulate

            420 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (ESCAP/ADB 2000 and ADB 2001). Tehran has also

      <p>Indoor air pollution is often a more severe health hazard than outdoor 
        air pollution. Most rural inhabitants in the region use twigs, grass, 
        dried animal dung, crop residues, wood, charcoal and kerosene as household 
        fuels. Coupled with inadequate ventilation, this results in highly contaminated 
        indoor air. Given the high levels of harmful emissions and the number 
        of people using traditional cooking fuels - Asia produces nearly half 
        of the world's woodfuel (FAOSTAT 2001) - the scale of exposure is large. 
        Health effects include acute respiratory infection in children, chronic 
        obstructive lung disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and lung cancer in 
        women. Acute respiratory diseases are prevalent in the rural and/or hilly 
        areas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
        Lanka where indoor air pollution is high. About 40 per cent of the global 
        infantile mortality caused by pneumonia occurs in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia 
        and Nepal; many of these deaths are caused by pollutants from burning 
        traditional fuels (ADB 2001). In India, household solid fuel use is estimated 
        to cause about 500 000 premature deaths a year in women and children under 
        five. There are indications that tuberculosis and blindness may be associated 
        with indoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution is blamed for 5-6 per 
        cent of the national burden of diseases in women and children in India 
        (Holdren and Smith 2000).</p>
      <p>The key areas for intervention are: use of cleaner fuels such as low-propane 
        gas and kerosene; development of high-grade biomass fuels; improvements 
        in stove design and better dissemination of stoves; improvements in housing; 
        and improvements in environmental awareness and education. To address 
        the problem of indoor air pollution in India, around 3 million biogas 
        plants and more than 22 million improved cooking stoves have been installed 
        in rural and remote areas of the country, resulting in a saving of the 
        equivalent of 21 million tonnes of firewood per annum (Times of India 
        2000).</p>
      <p>Haze and acid rain have been the emerging regional issues over the past 
        decade, especially in Asia because of China and India's overwhelming dependence 
        on coal. Around 0.28 million ha of forest land are reported to be damaged 
        by acid rain in the Sichuan basin of China. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 
        Asia are estimated to have increased from about 26.6 to about 39.2 million 
        tonnes during 1985-1997 (Streets and others 2000). In China, a reduction 
        of 3.7 million tonnes or 15.8 per cent in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions was 
        achieved during 1995-2000 (SEPA 2001). At least two-thirds of acid depositions 
        in the region are caused by coal-fired power plants with outdated pollution 
        control equipment.</p>

            <p>In spring 1999, scientists working on the project Indian Ocean 
              Experiment (INDOEX) discovered a dense brownish pollution haze layer 
              covering most of South and Southeast Asia and the tropical region 
              of the Indian Ocean. The researchers tracked the haze over an area 
              of about 10 million km<sup>2</sup>, and believe it forms over much 
              of the Asian continent. The haze is a mixture of pollutants, mainly 
              soot, sulphates, nitrates, organic particles, fly ash and mineral 
              dust, formed by fossil fuel combustion and rural biomass burning. 
              It reduces the sunlight reaching the tropical Indian Ocean surface, 
              thousands of kilometres from its source, by as much as 10 per cent, 
              with a larger reduction over the Indian sub-continent. Simulations 
              with global climate models indicate that the haze could have major 
              impacts on the monsoon circulation, regional rainfall patterns and 
              vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>A programme called ABC (Asian Brown Cloud) has been initiated with 
              support from UNEP. The main aim of the first phase of this programme 
              is to study the impact of the Asian haze on a number of parameters, 
              including monsoon change, water balance, agriculture and health. 
              Scientists plan to establish a network of ground-based monitoring 
              stations throughout Asia to study the composition and seasonal pattern 
              of the haze. UNEP has pledged to facilitate the continued research 
              programme and, in the longer-term, to help coordinate policy responses 
              to address the problem.</p>

      <p>Haze problems are also prevalent in the region due to forest fires in 
        Southeast Asia. The most serious episode occurred in 1997, when the effects 
        of forest fires in Indonesia extended to neighbouring countries including 
        Brunei Darussalam, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand 
        (UNEP 1999). A Haze Technical Task Force was established by ASEAN Senior 
        Officials on Environment in 1995 and, in 1997, a Regional Haze Action 
        Plan was approved (ASEAN 2001).</p>
      <p>The Acid Deposition Monitoring Network (EANET), with the participation 
        of ten East Asian countries, began a preparatory phase of monitoring acid 
        deposition in April 1998. In October 2000, the network decided to begin 
        regular monitoring from January 2001 (EANET 2000). In South Asia, the 
        Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and its likely 
        Transboundary Effects, was adopted by eight South Asian countries in 1998.</p>
