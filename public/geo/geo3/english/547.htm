      <p>Actions are taken in many regions to preserve major biodiversity hotspots. 
        In Europe and North America, major efforts are made to establish large-scale 
        networks of protected areas and green corridors. Some of the most significant 
        activities hinge on the management of common resources. Ocean fisheries 
        receive greater attention. For this and other reasons, the high Arctic 
        regions and the continent of Antarctica are increasingly recognized as 
        part of a common global heritage. A fundamental revision of the Antarctic 
        legal regime sets an example for similar action in the Arctic, where indigenous 
        groups play a significant role, individually and through the Arctic Council. 
        It becomes widely accepted that the polar regions have to be maintained 
        as places apart, with special rules regarding human activity. </p>
      <p>Cooperation on these and other issues also prompts moves to address the 
        tensions at the root of many ongoing conflicts. Sometimes these conflicts 
        and their impact on other regions catalyse the formation of broad coalitions. 
        The changing nature of security threats, as evidenced in the early part 
        of the century and the pressures from businesses and other groups with 
        strong cross-national connections, push nations towards increasingly multilateral 
        efforts on many issues. At other times, the resolution and avoidance of 
        conflicts are the results of networks and policies that have been established 
        for other purposes. For example, as borders become more open and responsibility 
        shifts from the nation state both downward to more local levels and upward 
        to more multinational levels, many disputes in countries and in border 
        areas in several regions, calm down or fade away entirely.</p>

      <p>Underlying many of these shifts are policies to boost transparency and 
        accountability. These policies include more and better certification and 
        labelling requirements, often building upon efforts started by industry. 
        The Forest Stewardship Council, Global Forest Watch and Marine Stewardship 
        Council spawn similar efforts focusing on other resources. These efforts 
        in turn influence other areas of policy, such as trade, foreign debt and 
        the enforcement of multilateral environmental treaties. In the developing 
        world, a major investment programme is undertaken to strengthen capacities 
        of governments, businesses (especially small and medium enterprises), 
        NGOs and local communities to develop, access and use information. These 
        changes are reflected in increased monitoring and communication. As much 
        as any other business sector, the commercial media has shifted away from 
        a pure emphasis on profit towards establishing a broader role in society.</p>
      <p>There are also fundamental shifts in terms of how the data used to track 
        development are measured, analysed and presented. Aggregate figures that 
        hide discrepancies between, for example, genders and social groups, or 
        between urban and rural areas, give way to more disaggregated data collection 
        and reporting. The changes are highlighted by the continuing evolution 
        of the United Nations System of National Accounts, especially the shift 
        away from Gross Domestic Product as the major indicator of development. 
        Environmental, economic and social indicators track real progress at all 
        scales - business, national, regional and global - giving the public a 
        more informed basis for seeking change. New technologies also play a big 
        role, both as catalysts for, and in response to, many of these changes.</p>
      <p>Developments in information and communication technologies enable groups 
        to connect to and learn from each other, by sharing success stories, but 
        also by exposing behaviour, whether legal or illegal, existing or planned, 
        that gives cause for disquiet. These technologies also become more instrumental 
        in coordinating social, political and economic activities. They are the 
        natural medium for a new consciousness, providing a sense of immediacy 
        and unity to a diverse and pluralistic movement.</p>
      <p>New technologies play an instrumental role in progress towards goals 
        already set. Among such advances are improvements in energy and water 
        use efficiency, desalination and medical technologies and treatment. These 
        breakthroughs are closely linked to general developments in the areas 
        of nano-technology and biotechnology. Governments, businesses and other 
        private organizations stimulate much of the technological development, 
        not only by direct investment in research and development, but also by 
        offering worthwhile prizes for new developments.</p>
      <p>In the areas of biotechnology and genetic engineering, there is strong 
        awareness of potential issues related to biosafety, bioterrorism and moral 
        concerns. Biotechnology also becomes increasingly linked to biodiversity 
        research within regions. Concerns over genetic engineering continue to 
        run high, but they are eased somewhat as developments in this area take 
        on a more regional profile, both in terms of who is undertaking and benefiting 
        from the research and the raw materials used in the processes. Carefully 
        controlled studies in many regions, including Asia and the Pacific, West 
        Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa, highlight the use of 
        endemic resources.</p>
      <p>Small and large businesses, in partnership with NGOs, provide valuable 
        support in setting standards and guidelines, technology transfer and mentoring 
        programmes. They also take greater responsibility for the whole life cycle 
        of projects and products. This includes not only activities related to 
        normal practice, but also those related to infrastructure development, 
        recovery of post-consumption wastes, capacity building and preparing employees 
        and communities for periods of transition, such as when projects end or 
        operations shift to another locality.</p>
