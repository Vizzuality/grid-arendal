      <p>The quantitative results presented in this chapter were developed to 
        illustrate the narrative scenarios and to provide an indication of their 
        likely environmental implications. These results were derived using a 
        range of analytical tools, in consultation with regional experts. They 
        emphasize general trends and differences between scenarios, rather than 
        precise levels of impact. This technical annex outlines the scenario development 
        process followed for <i>GEO-3</i>, and presents summary descriptions of 
        the analytical tools employed, and the indicators presented in the chapter. 
        More extensive information, including more detailed data tables and figures, 
        is presented in Raskin and Kemp-Benedict (2002) and in a separate technical 
        report (RIVM and UNEP, in press).</p>
      <p><b>The scenario development process</b></p>
      <p>Drawing from previous work of the Global Scenario Group (see Raskin and 
        Kemp-Benedict 2002), four global storylines were designed by a core scenario 
        team of global and regional experts. An initial quantification for a small 
        set of indicators was prepared at the level of the GEO sub-regions. Teams 
        in each of the seven major GEO regions then elaborated the storylines 
        at regional level and provided input to the quantitative analyses, particularly 
        with respect to key driving forces. The results of the regional efforts 
        were used to refine the global narratives and to undertake the subsequent 
        quantitative analyses associated with the scenario narratives. Further 
        refinement of both the narratives and the quantitative analyses was achieved 
        through an iterative process involving the core scenario team and the 
        modelling groups. During the development process the work underwent two 
        formal rounds of review and was scrutinized at a special workshop with 
        a group of scenario experts from around the world.</p>
      <p><b>Quantitative analytical tools</b></p>
      <p>AIM (Asian Pacific Integrated Model) is an integrated environment-economy 
        model developed by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) 
        and Kyoto University, Japan, to assess future scenarios of socio-economic 
        development and environmental change in Asia and the Pacific as well as 
        at global level. The set of AIM modules was developed primarily for assessing 
        effects of climate change policies and climate change impacts, but it 
        can also be applied to other environmental fields such as air pollution, 
        water resources, land use change and ecosystem assessment. With externally 
        derived socioeconomic data as input, the model estimates future environmental 
        conditions of 42 countries in Asia and the Pacific. The ecosystem module 
        uses a latitude-longitude grid with a spatial resolution of 2.5 x 2.5 
        minutes to facilitate policy analyses. The model has been extensively 
        reviewed and frequently used by the IPCC. More information about AIM is 
        available at <a target="_top" href="http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/ipcc/aim/">http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/ipcc/aim/</a></p>
      <p><b>GLOBIO </b>(Global methodology for mapping human impacts on the biosphere) 
        is a simple transparent global model developed under the GLOBIO project, 
        coordinated by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), UNEP-GRIDArendal, 
        UNEP-WCMC and UNEP/DEWA. It is used to visualize, at a scale of 1 x 1 
        km, the cumulative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function of growth 
        in human resource demand and associated infrastructure development. The 
        model provides a statistical risk assessment of probability of human impacts 
        using buffer zones from infrastructure that vary with type of human activity 
        and density of infrastructure, region, vegetation, climate and sensitivity 
        of species and ecosystems. Satellite imagery is used to derive overviews 
        of cumulative impacts of ongoing development. Future scenario situations 
        are derived from data on existing infrastructure, historic growth rates 
        of infrastructure, availability of petroleum and mineral reserves, vegetation 
        cover, population density, distance to coast and projected development. 
        More information on GLOBIO can be found at <a target="_top" href="http://www.globio.info">http://www.globio.info</a>

      <p><b>IMAGE 2.2</b> (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment) 
        is a dynamic integrated assessment model for global change developed by 
        the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The 
        Netherlands. IMAGE quantifies the consequences of different future developments 
        for a broad range of environmental issues. Driving forces are modelled 
        for 17 world regions, partly via the WorldScan general equilibrium model. 
        Impacts are calculated over long time frames (typically 100 years), and 
        with a high spatial resolution (0.5 x 0.5 degree latitude-longitude grid). 
        Long historical series are used to calibrate the model and place future 
        developments in perspective. The model has been extensively reviewed and 
        frequently used by the IPCC. More information about IMAGE is available 
        at <a target="_top" href="http://www.rivm.nl/image/">http://www.rivm.nl/image/</a> and 
        in Alcamo and others (1998) and IMAGE Team (2001a and 2001b).</p>
      <p><b>PoleStar </b>is a comprehensive and flexible software tool for sustainability 
        studies developed by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Boston 
        Centre, USA. Rather than being a rigid model, the software provides an 
        adaptable accounting framework and modelling environment for mounting 
        economic, resource and environmental information and for examining alternative 
        development scenarios. PoleStar has been used in a number of international 
        assessments, including quantification of the scenarios of the Global Scenario 
        Group (GSG). Technical documentation on PoleStar and details of the GSG 
        scenarios can be found online at <a target="_top" href="http://www.seib.org/polestar">http://www.seib.org/polestar</a>

      <p><b>WaterGAP 2.1</b> model (Water - Global Assessment and Prognosis) is 
        the first global model that computes both water availability and water 
        use on the river basin scale. WaterGAP, developed by the Center for Environmental 
        Systems Research (CESR), University of Kassel, Germany, has two main components, 
        a Global Hydrology Model and a Global Water Use Model. The Global Hydrology 
        Model simulates the characteristic macro-scale behaviour of the terrestrial 
        water cycle to estimate water availability. The Global Water Use Model 
        consists of three main sub-models that compute water use for the domestic, 
        industry and agriculture sectors. All computations cover the entire land 
        surface of the globe on a 0.5 x 0.5 degree latitude-longitude grid. A 
        global drainage direction map then allows the analysis of the water resources 
        situation in all large drainage basins worldwide. For a more detailed 
        description of the model see Alcamo and others (2000) and Center for Environmental 
        Systems Research (2002).</p>
      <p><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>Any discrepancies between the GEO-3 regions and 
        sub-regions and the regions represented in data sets used to generate

      <p><b>Variables</b></p>
      <p>Variables charted or mapped in the Outlook section of GEO-3 are (in alphabetical 
        order) as follows.</p>
      <p><b>Area with high risk of water-induced soil degradation </b>indicates 
        the land area that is at high risk from water erosion under a specific 
        form of land use. The sensitivity to water erosion is computed from the 
        soil and terrain characteristics, rainfall erosivity and land cover. In 
        global terms, water erosion is the most serious form of land degradation 
        and it is irreversible. Whether erosion actually occurs depends on implementation 
        of soil conservation measures at farm and landscape levels.</p>

        risk see UNEP/ISRIC 1991</p>
      <p><b>Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide </b>presents the global 
        CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere as the net balance between 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial production, 
        deforestation and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by mature and regrowing vegetation, 
        and by the oceans.</p>

      <p><b>Carbon dioxide emissions </b>covers emissions from land use, industrial 
        production and energy use. Emissions from industrial sources include the 
        emissions from non-energy use of fossil fuels (mainly feedstocks) and 
        industrial activities. Land-use sources of carbon dioxide include burning 
        forest biomass (after deforestation) and fuelwood, and releases by waste 
        processes after disposal of consumer goods such as paper, furniture and 
        building materials.</p>

      <p><b>Change in average temperature, 2002-32.</b> Given the uncertainties 
        in the regional distribution of temperature increase, this graph is based 
        on results from four different Global Circulation Models (GCMs) in combination 
        with IMAGE 2.2. For each of the GCMs, the spatially differentiated pattern 
        of temperature change for a reference scenario (1 per cent per annum growth 
        in equivalent greenhouse gas concentration from 1990 onwards) was taken, 
        north of 66°N and south of 66°S latitude. This pattern was then scaled 
        on the basis of global average temperature changes for each of the scenarios 
        as calculated by IMAGE 2.2. Finally, the average temperature change for 
        the Arctic and Antarctic was calculated. The GCMs used are HadCM2, ECHAM4, 
        CSIRO Mk2 and CGCM1. The GCM results were taken from the IPCC Data Distribution 
        Centre for Climate Change and Related Scenarios for Impacts Assessment 
        (IPCC-DCC 1999).</p>

      <p><b>Change in selected pressures on natural ecosystems 2002-32. </b>For 
        the ecosystem quality component, see the explanation of the Natural Capital 
        Index. Values for the cumulative pressures were derived as described under 
        Natural Capital Index. The maps show the relative increase or decrease 
        in pressure between 2002 and 2032. 'No change' means less than 10 per 
        cent change in pressure over the scenario period; small increase or decrease 
        means between 10 and 50 per cent change; substantial increase or decrease 
        means 50 to 100 per cent change; strong increase means more than doubling 
        of pressure. Areas which switch between natural and domesticated land 
        uses are recorded separately.</p>

        expressed in degrees per ten years. The rate of temperature change is 
        important since sensitive ecosystems may not be able to adapt at high 
        rates. Research has shown that, at rates larger than 0.1°C per ten years, 
        extensive damage to ecosystems is probable (Vellinga and Swart 1991).</p>

      <p><b>Municipal solid waste generation </b>is an index of solid waste generation 
        from household and commercial sources. Total solid waste generation in 
        the Asia and Pacific region in the year 1995 has been allocated an index 
        value of 1. Index values for 2032 under each scenario relate to the index 
        for the base year.</p>
      <p>Source: AIM</p>
      <p><b>Natural Capital Index </b>is a measure for terrestrial and aquatic 
        biodiversity of natural ecosystems and agricultural land. The index is 
        calculated as the product of habitat area times ecosystem quality, expressed 
        as a percentage. The habitat area is taken as the percentage of remaining 
        surface of natural ecosystems. Ecosystem quality is approximated from 
        four pressure factors that are considered to have a major influence on 
        biodiversity and for which global data are available. Based on literature, 
        for each pressure factor a range is defined from no effect to complete 
        deterioration of habitats if the maximum value is exceeded over a long 
        time. Pressure factors are population density (min-max: 10-150 persons 
        per km<sup>2</sup>), primary energy use (min-max: 0.5-100 peta Joules 
        per km<sup>2</sup>), rate of temperature change (min-max: 0.2-2.0°C in 
        a 20 year period) and restoration time for exhausted agricultural land, 
        livestock area and deforested zones in re-conversion towards natural, 
        lowimpacted ecosystems (min-max: 100-0 restoration time). The proxy for 
        ecosystem quality is a reversed function of these pressures, calculated 
        as a percentage of the low-impacted baseline state. The higher the pressure, 
        the lower the quality. Finally, the percentages for habitat area and quality 
        are multiplied, resulting in a pressure-based Natural Capital Index. The 
        calculations were carried out on a detailed latitude-longitude grid, before 
        aggregation to subregions and regions.</p>

      <p><b>Potential increase in nitrogen loading on coastal ecosystems.</b> 
        At the sub-regional aggregation level employed in GEO, nitrogen loading 
        can be taken as a proxy for a wider range of land-based pollution on the 
        coastal ecosystems. The potential growth of the subregional nitrogen load 
        under each of the scenarios has been estimated by rating the change in 
        determinants such as sewage inputs and level of treatment, fertilizer 
        use and airborne emissions, on a ten-point scale.</p>

        crops in 2002.</p>

      <p><b>Population living in areas with severe water stress.</b> Water stress 
        is measured by the 'withdrawal-to-availability' ratio (wta-ratio). This 
        ratio captures how much of the average annual renewable water resources 
        of a river basin are withdrawn for human purposes in the domestic, industry 
        and agricultural sectors. In principle, the higher the ratio, the more 
        intensively the water in a river is used; this reduces either water quantity 
        or water quality or even both for downstream users. Commonly it is assumed 
        that when the wtaratio in a river basin exceeds 0.4, or 40 per cent, the 
        river basin experiences severe water stress.</p>

      <p><b>Population living with hunger</b> refers to the incidence of chronic 
        under-nutrition in developing and transitional regions (using 1995 data 
        based on FAO estimates), the incidence of food insecurity in the United 
        States and estimates for other countries based on income distribution. 
        Hunger patterns are determined in the scenarios by changes in income, 
        income distribution and population.</p>
