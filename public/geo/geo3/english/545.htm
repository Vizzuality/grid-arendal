      <p>The journey that these processes set in motion is a long one. It takes 
        many years and does not proceed without constant pressure and action from 
        many sectors of society. A profound set of changes, which were only hinted 
        at in the early years of the century, gradually unfolds, quietly most 
        of the time, not so quietly at others. People everywhere begin to embrace 
        the idea of a 'new sustainability paradigm' that promises to transcend 
        conventional values and lifestyles. This new paradigm combines a powerful 
        personal and philosophical dimension with concern over economic growth, 
        technological potential and political eventualities. </p>

      <p>Among more affluent people and groups, disenchantment with consumerism 
        sparks off a quest for more fulfilling and ethical ways of living that 
        can restore a sense of meaning and purpose to their existence. The values 
        of simplicity, cooperation and community begin to displace those of consumerism, 
        competition and individualism. More time is spent on study, art, hobbies 
        and engaging in the wider community.</p>
      <p>The success of the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in South Africa, 
        East Timor and elsewhere stimulate similar exercises in other places, 
        including less strictly political settings, such as within the tobacco 
        and chemicals industries. The positive results of the peacemaking process 
        in Northern Ireland and Bosnia enhance efforts in other regions. Dialogues 
        between the world's major religions, directly stimulated by the terrorist 
        activities against the United States and subsequent retaliation, further 
        help to create the foundation for greater understanding and cooperation.</p>
      <p>In some regions, the mood of society is a mixture of battle fatigue and 
        disgust with current leaders. Small-scale but locally significant environmental 
        disasters also have an effect on this mood. These factors combine to make 
        more people willing to explore and question fundamental beliefs.</p>
      <p>Citizens and consumers, where possible with their votes and wallets and 
        otherwise with their feet and their voices, make it clear that progressive 
        businesses and governments will be rewarded while others will be rejected. 
        At some point, a critical mass is reached, whereby activities that have 
        until now appeared isolated and of little consequence, begin to spread 
        and affect broader regions.</p>
      <p>In developing regions and amongst indigenous communities everywhere, 
        a new generation of thinkers, leaders and activists emerges to join and 
        shape the global dialogue. Many regions draw on the dual legacy of nature-conscious 
        traditional societies and ideas of visionary thinkers seeking better paths 
        for development. Cultural renaissance evolves in many regions, rooted 
        in respect for tradition and an appreciation of local human and natural 
        resources. Young people from all regions and cultures play a key role 
        in promoting these values. The increased opportunity to meet and learn 
        from others of their generation, both virtually and in person, fuels a 
        rediscovery of idealism as they join together in the project of forging 
        a global community.</p>
      <p>What is new in the current discussion is the willingness of people to 
        reflect upon the positive and negative aspects of their own actions and 
        legacies as well as those of other cultures. Many of these debates are 
        launched within the developing world, engaging an ever-expanding circle 
        of stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The notion that the prevailing market oriented wisdom is both insufficient 
        and undesirable garners more and more support. This switch is most significant 
        in North America and Western Europe, as well as among many of the affluent 
        in other regions, who have been seen as the key purveyors and beneficiaries 
        of this approach to development. At the same time, it is recognized that 
        the increasing openness and participation in governance have played a 
        key role in the advances that have improved life for many people in many 
        parts of the world.</p>
      <p>This change of heart gives rise to more measured discussions about the 
        seemingly inexorable spread of globalization in all of its forms. The 
        realization grows that, even if it were possible, it would not be desirable 
        to stem this tide completely. Around the world, from Latin America to 
        Africa to West Asia, the re-examination of history leads to new approaches 
        for dealing with the changes happening in and outside their regions. Inevitably, 
        this re-think is influenced in part by the return of many former emigrants, 
        for brief periods or permanently, who have gained experience and understanding 
        of how cultures can learn from each other without losing their own identity.</p>
