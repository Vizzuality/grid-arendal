      <p>Climatic variability and associated floods and droughts result in increased 
        risks of crop failure and therefore reduced food security, as well as 
        higher incidences of malnutrition and disease. In Ethiopia, for example, 
        the 1984 drought affected 8.7 million people, 1 million people died and 
        millions more suffered from malnutrition and famine. This drought also 
        caused the death of nearly 1.5 million livestock (FAO 2000). The 1991-92 
        drought in Southern Africa caused a 54 per cent reduction in cereal harvest 
        and exposed more than 17 million people to the risk of starvation (Calliham, 
        Eriksen and Herrick 1994). More than 100 000 people died in the Sahelian 
        drought of the 1970s and 1980s (Wijkman and Timberlake 1984). Crop failure 
        and livestock losses lead to increased dependence on imports and foreign 
        aid, reducing economic performance and the ability to cope with future 
        environmental disasters.</p>

            <p>In the past 30 years, Africa has experienced at least one major 
              drought episode in each decade. In Eastern Africa there were serious 
              droughts in 1973-74, 1984-85, 1987, 1992-94 and in 1999-2000 (DMC 
              2000). The last Sahelian drought persisted for a decade, from 1972-73 
              to 1983-84. Severe droughts were recorded in Southern Africa in 
              1967 to 1973, 1982-83, 1986-87, 1991-92 and 1993-94 (Chenje and 
              Johnson 1994).</p>
            <p>The Western Indian Ocean islands are subject to tropical storms 
              on average ten times a year during November to May. The El Niño 
              Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which affects much of Africa, has been 
              associated with more frequent, persistent and intense warm phases 
              over the past 30 years (IPCC 2001a). The 1997-98 ENSO event triggered 
              higher sea surface temperatures in the southwest Indian Ocean, and 
              flooding and landslides across most of Eastern Africa (Ogallo 2001).</p>

      <p>In 1997 and 1998, parts of Eastern Africa suffered from high rainfall 
        and flooding due to ENSO disturbances, and in 1999 and 2000 Southern Africa 
        and the Western Indian Ocean islands experienced devastating cyclones 
        and floods. Flood water is an ideal habitat for bacteria and mosquitoes. 
        In Uganda, the ENSO-induced floods of 1997-98 caused more than 500 deaths 
        from cholera, and a further 11 000 people were hospitalized (NEMA 1999).</p>
      <p>The sea temperature rise of 1.0-1.5°C due to the ENSO disturbances is 
        thought to have resulted in bleaching of up to 30 per cent of the coral 
        in Comoros, 80 per cent in Seychelles (PRE/COI 1998), and 90 per cent 
        in Kenya and Tanzania (Obura and others 2000).</p>

      <p><a name="fig219"></a>The region's vulnerability to natural disasters 
        is compounded by the anticipated impacts of global climate change. According 
        to IPCC, Africa is the most vulnerable region in terms of predicted decreases 
        in water and food security, because widespread poverty limits adaptive 
        capacity (IPCC 1998). Changes in rainfall could also have serious consequences 
        for those parts of Africa that depend on hydroelectricity.</p>
      <p>The anticipated sea level rise resulting from global climate change may 
        threaten many coastal settlements and islands including the Western Indian 
        Ocean islands. The extent of sea level rise is still uncertain but the 
        latest IPCC (2001a) estimates are in the range 10-94 cm by the year 2100. 
        Even if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized immediately, 
        sea level would continue to rise for many years. IPCC also predicts that 
        the intensity of cyclones, rain and wind will probably increase (IPCC 
        2001a), and the cyclone zone in the Western Indian Ocean could expand 
        to include Seychelles (UNEP 1999).</p>
      <p>Changes to rainfall and temperature patterns could also alter biodiversity, 
        with many species not being able to adapt or migrate to more suitable 
        areas. WWF forecasts that an anticipated 5 per cent decrease in rainfall 
        in Southern Africa will affect grazing species such as hartebeest, wildebeest 
        and zebra, threatening wildlife in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, 
        the Okavango delta in Botswana and Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. There 
        are also fears that malaria could spread to new areas such as parts of 
        eastern Namibia and northern South Africa (WWF 1996).</p>
      <p>The region's ability to adapt to climate change will depend on several 
        factors, including population growth and consumption patterns, which will 
        affect demand for food and water, and the location of populations and 
        infrastructure in relation to vulnerable coastal areas, which will determine 
        economic losses due to sea level rise. Many countries will need to change 
        their agricultural practices, particularly to reduce dependency on rainfed 
        agriculture, and to avoid cultivation in marginal areas. Rural communities 
        that currently depend on biomass for energy may be forced to seek alternative 
        sources if climate change brings about changes to vegetation type and 
        distribution.</p>
