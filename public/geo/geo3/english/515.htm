        oil crises of the 1970s, the end of China's isolation and the collapse

      <p>Some aspects of modern life might have been foreseen in general terms, 
        by extending such longterm trends as reduction in trade barriers, continual 
        technological innovation and the growing role of the service sector. Following 
        the 1972 Stockholm Conference, the emergence of a worldwide environmental 
        movement might have been anticipated and hoped for. But few, if any, recognized 
        the major regional and global issues such as acidification, stratospheric 
        ozone depletion and climate change, which have driven much of the action 
        in recent years.</p>
      <p>Moving into the future means travelling into uncharted waters. Some of 
        the way ahead is clear but there is much that cannot be mapped out, even 
        with advanced technologies. As before, there will be challenges that can 
        be prepared for but others that will seem to materialize from out of the 
        blue.</p>
      <p>How shall we proceed as a society? By placing faith in further globalization 
        and liberalization, trusting primarily in the market economy to solve 
        wider social and environmental concerns? Or by putting policy first, whereby 
        coordinated action to solve social and environmental problems balances 
        the drive for economic development? If and when troubles arise, will everyone 
        work together to address these threats, or will groups that are better 
        off focus on self-protection, creating fortress conditions that increasingly 
        exclude the 'havenots'? Or could a more visionary state of affairs emerge, 
        where radical shifts in the way people interact with one another and with 
        the world around them stimulate and support sustainable policy measures?</p>

            <p>Scenarios can be told in many ways. The two most common methods 
              used in scenario analysis have been descriptive, written narratives 
              (qualitative scenarios) and tables and figures incorporating numerical 
              data, often generated by sophisticated computer models (quantitative 
              scenarios). Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses and their 
              relative worth has been much debated.</p>
            <ul class="global">
              <li> Qualitative scenarios can explore relationships and trends 
                for which few or no numerical data are available, including shocks 
                and discontinuities. They can more easily incorporate human motivations, 
                values and behaviour and create images that capture the imagination 
                of those for whom they are intended.</li>
              <li>Quantitative scenarios can provide greater rigour, precision 
                and consistency. Their assumptions are explicit and their conclusions 
                can be traced back to the assumptions. The effects of changes 
                in assumptions can be easily checked, pointing to important uncertainties. 
                They can provide order-of-magnitude estimates of past, present 
                and future trends in, for example, population growth, economic 
                growth or resource use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In <i>GEO-3</i>, qualitative narratives take centre stage with 
              the quantitative tools playing a supporting role.</p>

      <p>There is no knowing which of these - or other - possible futures will 
        actually unfold over the next 30 years. Much of what will happen has already 
        been set in motion by policy decisions and actions that have already been 
        taken. Uncontrolled forces, both human and natural, will contribute to 
        the course of events. But informed decision-making also has a real and 
        vital role to play in the process of shaping the future.</p>
      <p>Scenario analysis can make a difference to this process. By exploring 
        an array of possible future scenarios, today's decision-makers can get 
        a clearer picture of what tomorrow might bring in terms of human well-being 
        and environmental security and what the impact of their decisions is likely 
        to be. And they can determine more accurately what it would take - and 
        what they can do - to create a more desirable future.</p>
      <p>Scenarios are descriptions of journeys to possible futures. They reflect 
        different assumptions about how current trends will unfold, how critical 
        uncertainties will play out and what new factors will come into play. 
        Since it emerged as a formal methodology in the middle of the past century, 
        scenario analysis has evolved swiftly as a tool for anticipating the future. 
        It is now generally accepted that scenarios do not predict. Rather, they 
        paint pictures of possible futures and explore the differing outcomes 
        that might result if basic assumptions are changed. Hence the relevant 
        question that scenarios can answer is not what will happen but what might 
        happen and how people could act to encourage or counteract particular 
        events and trends. As a way of exploring the unknown, scenario analysis 
        can result in surprising and innovative insights.</p>
      <p>The scenarios developed for <i>GEO-3</i> have an environmental focus 
        but recognize that the environment cannot be discussed without also considering 
        what may be happening in the social and economic spheres. The scenarios 
        therefore span eventualities in many overlapping areas, including population, 
        economics, technology and governance. Moreover, though many issues are 
        of global concern, some take on special relevance or sharper focus when 
        viewed at a regional or smaller scale. To take account of this effect 
        - and so that each can enrich the others - this chapter presents both 
        global and regional perspectives. In addition, the role of policy choices 
        in shaping the future is highlighted in the scenarios wherever possible, 
        although this influence can be hard to judge because other policies and 
        independent developments may cloud the effects of any single policy. Drawing 
        on the experience and work of other scenario initiatives, including those 
        of the Global Scenario Group (Raskin and Kemp-Benedict 2002), a set of 
        four scenarios has been developed for <i>GEO-3</i>.</p>

      <p>For each of these scenarios, an overall narrative - 'A tale of four futures' 
        - describes the future in the next 30 years in a predominantly qualitative 
        manner, providing both regional and global perspectives.</p>
      <p>The stories of the four scenarios are followed by a more detailed examination 
        of their environmental implications, drawing on quantitative data derived 
        from a number of analytical tools - and with a regional focus intended 
        to highlight particular concerns in the different regions. A brief comparison 
        of qualitative and quantitative approaches is provided in the box. For 
        more details of the <i>GEO-3</i> scenario analysis, see the <a href="584.htm">technical 
        annex</a> to this chapter.</p>
      <p>The chapter concludes with 'Lessons from the future', a discussion of 
        important lessons arising from the scenario analysis for future environmentally 
        relevant policy development. Before embarking on the journey through these 
        four possible futures, however, it is useful to know the key assumptions 
        made in constructing them and how these act as driving forces behind the 
        scenarios. These assumptions are therefore outlined in the next section.</p>
