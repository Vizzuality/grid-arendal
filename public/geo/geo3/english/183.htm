      <p>Forest governance systems are evolving rapidly, together with the respective 
        roles and responsibilities of government, the private sector, indigenous 
        communities and civil society. The concept of sustainable forest management 
        - and efforts to achieve it - continued to gain momentum around the world 
        during the past decade Broader approaches to forest management, such as 
        integrated ecosystem and landscape management, are becoming more widely 
        accepted and put into practice. These approaches recognize the dynamic 
        nature of ecological and social systems, and the importance of adaptive 
        management and collaborative decision-making. As of 2000, 149 countries 
        were engaged in nine international initiatives to develop and implement 
        criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, covering nearly 
        85 per cent of the world's forest. At least 6 per cent of the total forest 
        area in the developing countries is covered by a formal, nationally approved 
        forest management plan, lasting at least five years. Some 89 per cent 
        of the forests in industrialized countries are managed according to formal 
        or informal management plans. An FAO survey of 145 countries found that 
        96 per cent of the countries had national forest programmes in various 
        stages of development. Model and demonstration forest programmes are widely 
        used to illustrate sustainable forest management in practice (FAO 2001a). 
      </p>
      <p>The involvement of local communities in joint forest management is now 
        a significant feature of national forest policies and programmes throughout 
        the world. Faced with inadequate financial and human resources, governments 
        of developing countries are increasingly turning to local communities 
        for assistance in protecting and managing state-owned forests. In some 
        of these management schemes, the community provides the labour and protection, 
        while gaining access to areas that were once restricted. Although several 
        community-based management programmes have been successful, these systems 
        are still evolving (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>There is also growing awareness of the extent of illegal forest activities, 
        including corrupt practices, and of the immense financial, environmental 
        and social costs that these incur. Corruption, considered a taboo subject 
        until recently, is now openly discussed in major international fora and 
        is being actively tackled by governments, NGOs, the private sector and 
        international organizations Elements in the fight against crime and corruption 
        include strengthened monitoring and enforcement systems, increased transparency 
        in decision-making, simpler laws and more severe punishment (FAO 2001a). 
      </p>
      <p>At the international level, two major international initiatives followed 
        publication of the <i>1980 Tropical Forest Resources Assessment</i>. The 
        first was the establishment of the International Tropical Timber Organization 
        (ITTO) in 1983 under UNCTAD, which aimed to bring together producer and 
        consumer countries of tropical timber. ITTO works with projects and has 
        permanent committees on reforestation, industries and markets. While not 
        its original intention, ITTO has become a major platform for issues related 
        to sustainable forest management (ITTO 2000). </p>
      <p>The second was the Tropical Forestry Action Plan (TFAP). Launched in 
        1985 jointly by FAO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World 
        Bank and World Resources Institute, TFAP had four priority areas for action: 
        forestry in land use; fuelwood and energy; conservation of tropical forest 
        ecosystems; and institutions. Towards the end of 1990, TFAP came under 
        major criticism for the way it was managed. Around 1995, TFAP was revamped, 
        made more 'country driven', with a focus on strengthening of planning 
        capacity of governments, and renamed the National Forestry Action Program 
        (Sargent 1990, Persson 2000). </p>
      <p>The forest resources assessments of 1980 and 1990 provided important 
        background information for the UNCED process. The findings on deforestation 
        (15.3 million ha annually during 1980-1990) and lack of country capacity 
        in forest resources assessment were timely for framing national capacity 
        building recommendations in <i>Agenda 21</i>. The overarching principles 
        governing sustainable forest management, formulated during UNCED in the 
        <i>Forest Principles </i>and Chapter 11 in <i>Agenda 21</i>, have been 
        further elaborated during the past ten years. Three of the international 
        conventions agreed at UNCED, the UNFCCC already mentioned, the Convention 
        on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification, 
        also have important bearings on the future of forests (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>A common vision for the management, conservation, and sustainable development 
        of all types of forests has been facilitated by the Intergovernmental 
        Panel on Forests (IPF) (1995-1997) and Intergovernmental Forum on Forests 
        (IFF) (1997- 2000), both under the auspices of the United Nations Commission 
        on Sustainable Development (UNCSD). The IPF/IFF process has resulted in 
        nearly 300 agreed proposals for action and in the creation of the United 
        Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) in October 2000, a permanent high-level 
        intergovernmental body with universal membership. To support the UNFF 
        and to enhance policy coordination and international cooperation, a Collaborative 
        Partnership on Forests (CPF) was formed by 11 international forest-related 
        organizations both within and outside the UN system. The main operative 
        means of the UNFF is its multiyear programme of work and the plan of action 
        for the implementation of the IPF/IFF proposals for action. Although it 
        is possible that UNFF debates will stimulate national policies and trigger 
        action by CPF organizations, the first session of the UNFF in June 2001 
        failed to create either a clear mandate or accountability for implementing 
        the proposals for action (IISD 2001c). </p>
      <p>An important international challenge, to both South and North, is to 
        ensure sustainability of forest goods, services and biological diversity 
        in all forest types. The recognition of the importance of forest ecosystems 
        and threats to their integrity by the Stockholm Conference was an important 
        step. However, subsequent work has not halted the loss of valued forest. 
        The assessments show continued deforestation and forest degradation. The 
        concerted action required to control and reverse these trends - while 
        also addressing the poverty which is so frequently associated with communities 
        that remain dependent upon forest resources - is long overdue. Dealing 
        successfully with forests as an issue on the international agenda will 
        largely depend on the international community's ability to mobilize political, 
        financial, scientific and technical support for sustainable forest management, 
        particularly in developing countries.</p>
