      <p>The expansion of agriculture over the past three decades involved the 
        cultivation of marginal areas, or clearance of important natural habitats 
        such as forests and wetlands. Such conversion is a major driving force 
        behind land degradation. In the Western Indian Ocean islands, for example, 
        competition for land is so intense that coastal wetlands have deliberately 
        been destroyed, and inland swamps have been drained and used as construction 
        sites (UNEP 1999b). Many African rural communities survive by moving their 
        cattle and crops as subsiding floodwaters expose enriched bottomlands 
        and floodplains. More than 1.5 million people in Mali, Mauritania, Senegal 
        and Sudan depend on this resource, as do vast numbers of wild herbivores 
        (Maltby 1986). Draining wetlands for agriculture therefore threatens not 
        only habitats and biodiversity but also the livelihoods of pastoralists 
        and wildlife.</p>
      <p>Loss of natural habitats has reduced vegetation cover and exposed soils 
        to wind and water erosion. Wind and water erosion is extensive in many 
        parts of Africa with about 25 per cent of the land prone to water erosion 
        and about 22 per cent to wind erosion (Reich and others 2001).</p>
      <p>Soil erosion also causes increased rates of siltation of dams and rivers, 
        and increased risk of flooding in rivers and estuaries. In Sudan, for 
        example, the total capacity of the Roseires reservoir - which generates 
        80 per cent of the country's electricity - has fallen by 40 per cent in 
        30 years due to siltation of the Blue Nile (Conway 2001).</p>
      <p>Soil erosion reduces the productivity of land, requiring farmers to apply 
        more and more fertilizers and other chemicals that help check falling 
        productivity. However, many small-scale farmers cannot afford to buy these 
        inputs and so get low yields.</p>

      <p><a name="fig71"></a>As a result of the increasing recognition of soil 
        nutrient depletion, a soil fertility initiative for sub- Saharan Africa 
        (where the problem is particularly widespread) was established in 1996 
        (New Agriculturalist 2001). The objective is to strengthen action by the 
        participating agencies to improve productivity and increase farm incomes 
        through a combination of policy reform and technology adaptation. National 
        soil fertility action plans are currently being prepared in 23 sub-Saharan 
        countries. Organic farming systems offer considerable scope for addressing 
        soil fertility problems as well as raising farm incomes.</p>
      <p>Policies on land management have generally failed to address the root 
        causes of land degradation which stem from colonial imbalances in land 
        distribution, lack of incentives for conservation, insecure tenure and 
        the failure to provide for diversified rural production systems (Moyo 
        1998). The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) 
        points out that land degradation is intricately linked to poverty and 
        that addressing this problem requires the participation of the resource 
        users and, where appropriate, providing them with alternative livelihood 
        options. Many African nations have signed and ratified the convention, 
        and 15 countries submitted national action programmes in 2000. The Maghreb 
        Arab Union, Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community 
        of West African States and the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought 
        Control in the Sahel also submitted sub-regional plans. This has served 
        to raise public awareness about issues of environment and resource sustainability, 
        but the resources required to enforce these plans have frequently been 
        inadequate (UNCCD 2001). A recent study estimated that desertification 
        processes affect 46 per cent of Africa, and 55 per cent of that area is 
        at high or very high risk. The worst affected areas are along desert margins 
        (see map), and in total about 485 million people are affected (Reich and 
        others 2001).</p>
      <p>The success of land conservation programmes depends on several factors, 
        and is closely linked with socio-economic conditions. Improving the distribution 
        of wealth, access to resources and economic opportunities are key factors 
        (SARIPS 2000). Peace and political stability are vital to improving resource 
        and food security, as shown by the low per capita food production of countries 
        where there is conflict, and resource security is necessary to implement 
        and sustain conservation programmes. Improving extension services and 
        access to appropriate and affordable technology, rural credit schemes 
        and marketing assistance, and breaking down trade barriers are other essential 
        requirements for sustainable agricultural development. <sup></sup></p>
