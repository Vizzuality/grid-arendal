                  facing water stress and scarcity, and land degradation, are 
                  major environmental issues in the region. The rising costs of 
                  water treatment, food imports, medical treatment and soil conservation 
                  measures are not only increasing human vulnerability and health 
                  insecurity but are also draining African countries of their 
                  economic resources. The expansion of agriculture into marginal 
                  areas and clearance of natural habitats such as forests and 
                  wetlands has been a major driving force behind land degradation. 
                  The loss of biological resources translates into loss of economic 
                  potential and options for commercial development in the future. 
                  These negative changes, however, have been tempered by Africa's 
                  impressive wildlife conservation record, including a well-established 
                  network of protected areas and the region's commitment to multilateral 
                  environmental agreements. African countries also participate 
                  in many regional and sub-regional initiatives and programmes. 
                  Notable achievements include the 1968 African Convention on 
                  the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (currently 
                  being updated) and the 1991 Bamako Convention on the Ban of 
                  the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement

                  of policy measures have compounded environmental problems in 
                  many parts of the region. Biological resources have long been 
                  of subsistence importance, and have been increasingly exploited 
                  for trade. About three-quarters of known or suspected species 
                  extinctions have occurred on isolated islands in the region. 
                  Protected areas constitute only 5 per cent of the total area, 
                  compared to the IUCN benchmark of 10 per cent. Discharge of 
                  sewage and other wastes has heavily polluted freshwater. Sedimentation 
                  in rivers and reservoirs caused by large-scale deforestation 
                  has also resulted in big economic losses. Urbanization, industrialization 
                  and tourism, coupled with a growing coastal population, have 
                  degraded many coastal areas. More than 60 per cent of Asia's 
                  mangroves have been converted to aquaculture farms. Air pollution 
                  levels in some cities are among the highest in the world. While 
                  most environmental trends have been negative, positive changes 
                  have included improvement in governance by public authorities, 
                  growing environmental awareness and public participation, and

                  (for example, emissions to air); the state of biodiversity and 
                  forests has not changed greatly; and other situations have undergone 
                  marked degradation (freshwater, and some coastal and marine 
                  areas). By the 1990s, the European atmosphere had generally 
                  improved significantly. Increasing efforts to safeguard natural 
                  areas and biodiversity may signal a turnaround in species protection. 
                  Freshwater stocks are unevenly distributed, with parts of southern,

                  the rising population, increasing inequality of incomes, limited

                  economic ties between Canada and the United States. At the same 
                  time, regional environmental degradation led to an increased 
                  recognition of the interdependent nature of cross-border ecosystems. 
                  The two countries strengthened cooperative measures to address 
                  transboundary pollution, agreeing to more aggressive NO<sub>X</sub> 
                  emission controls, for example. They also undertook to conserve 
                  the continent's wetland habitats to protect waterfowl and other 
                  migratory species. The impact of introduced exotic species on 
                  biological diversity became of increasing environmental concern 
                  with the liberalization of trade.</td>

                  regions include the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, 
                  the long-range transport of air pollutants, warming associated 
                  with global climate change, the decline of several bird, mammal 
                  and fish species, and pollution of major rivers. In the Arctic, 
                  average yearly ozone levels in the 1990s had declined by 10 
                  per cent from the late 1970s, increasing the risk of snow blindness 
                  and sunburn. Climate change is expected to be more extreme in 
                  the polar regions than anywhere else. Human activities are major 
                  threats to biodiversity in the Arctic. The warming trend is 
                  reducing the ice habitat for species such as the polar bear 
                  and walrus. In the Antarctic, sealing and whaling have reduced 
                  populations in the Southern Ocean. Eutrophication is a recent 
                  problem in several lakes in Scandinavia. One of the major developments 
                  in the Arctic is public opposition to dam construction, particularly 
                  in the Nordic countries. For example, in 2001 Iceland's National 
                  Planning Agency rejected plans for a hydroelectric power project 
                  that would have dammed two of the three main rivers flowing 
                  from Europe's largest glacier and destroyed an extensive wilderness.</td>
