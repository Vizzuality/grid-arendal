      <p>Some of the global and regional environmental implications arising out 
        of the four scenarios are highlighted below.</p>
      <p>The absence of effective policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide 
        and other greenhouse gases in the <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security 
        First </i>scenarios leads to significant increases over the next 30 years. 
        However, the policy actions taken under a <i>Policy First </i>scenario, 
        notably carbon taxes and investments in non-fossil-fuel energy sources, 
        effectively curb growth in global emissions and lead to actual reductions 
        starting around 2030. The behavioural shifts under <i>Sustainability First</i>, 
        together with improved production and conversion efficiencies, result 
        in a rapid levelling off of emissions and a decline by the middle of the 
        2020s. </p>

      <p><a name="figo13"></a>Biodiversity will continue under threat if there 
        is no strenuous policy action to curb human activity. Continued urban 
        and infrastructure expansion, plus the increased impacts of climate change, 
        severely deplete biodiversity in most regions in all scenarios. Pressures 
        will also increase on coastal ecosystems in most regions and scenarios.</p>
      <p>The scenarios carry important implications for the provision of basic 
        human needs. Growing populations and increased economic activity, particularly 
        in agriculture, will lead to increased demand for freshwater in most scenarios. 
        Similarly, the demands for food and the ability to meet them in the different 
        scenarios reflect a combination of shifts in supply and demand, influenced 
        by social, economic and environmental policies. In <i>Markets First</i>, 
        even with a decrease in the percentage of the population facing hunger, 
        the total number affected changes relatively little and even increases 
        in some regions as populations grow. Under <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>the targeting of hunger reduction as a key goal, and the emphasis 
        on more balanced development between regions, help to achieve dramatic 
        reductions in the percentages and total numbers of people affected. The 
        sharp increases in most regions in <i>Security First </i>points to the 
        unsustainability of such a scenario in terms of social acceptability.</p>
      <p>In Africa, there is increasing risk of land degradation. In <i>Policy 
        First </i>and <i>Sustainability First</i>, easier access to support services 
        helps farmers to manage soils better and policies based on integrated 
        land management become commonplace in the region. At the other end of 
        the spectrum, in a <i>Security First </i>scenario, while reasonable conditions 
        are maintained in the protected areas serving the land-owning elite, the 
        high concentration of people elsewhere contribute to severe land degradation 
        and soil erosion. Similar problems arise in <i>Markets First </i>as better 
        quality agricultural land is taken over for commodity and cash crop production.</p>
      <p>Under the <i>Markets First </i>scenario in Asia and the Pacific, water 
        withdrawals are expected to increase in all sectors, leading to an expansion 
        of areas with severe water stress in South and Southeast Asia. Slower 
        economic growth under <i>Security First </i>tempers growth in demand. 
        With effective policies and lifestyle changes under the <i>Policy First 
        </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>scenarios, water withdrawals remain 
        at current levels or even decrease in most of the region.</p>
      <p>The ability of Europe to address the issues of large-scale air pollution 
        and greenhouse gas emissions will depend heavily upon developments in 
        the areas of energy use and transportation. Extremely active policies 
        to improve public transportation and energy efficiency can be expected 
        in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>worlds, but not 
        in <i>Security First </i>or even <i>Markets First </i>circumstances.</p>
      <p>Land and forest degradation as well as forest fragmentation remain among 
        the most relevant environmental issues in Latin America and the Caribbean 
        in all scenarios. Significant loss of forest area occurs in a <i>Markets 
        First </i>scenario. In a <i>Security First </i>world, the control over 
        forest resources by transnational companies that create cartels in association 
        with the national groups in power, promotes the growth of some forest 
        areas, but this is not enough to stop net deforestation. More effective 
        management ameliorates some of these problems in <i>Policy First</i>. 
        Unsound deforestation stops almost completely in a world of <i>Sustainability 
        First</i>.</p>

      <p><a name="figo14"></a>As the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, 
        North America plays a major role in determining the future climate of 
        the planet. In<i> Markets First</i>, the region's refusal to participate 
        significantly hampers international efforts to control the emissions of 
        these gases, and per capita and absolute emissions remain high. The collapse 
        of parts of the transport infrastructure and restrictions on fossil-fuel 
        vehicle ownership in <i>Security First </i>result in even greater increases 
        in emissions in this scenario. Under <i>Policy First</i>, emissions are 
        reduced through increased fuel efficiency and greater use of public transport 
        but most spectacular results are achieved in <i>Sustainability First</i>.</p>
      <p>West Asia is one of the most water-stressed regions of the world, with 
        more than 70 million people living in areas under severe water stress. 
        Under the <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security First</i> scenarios, population 
        and economic growth lead to strong increases in withdrawals for households 
        and industry, resulting in an increase in areas with severe water stress 
        and affecting over 200 million people by 2032. A range of policy initiatives 
        help to counteract additional demands related to economic growth in both 
        <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First</i>. Although total withdrawals 
        drop in both scenarios, water scarcity persists and demand continues to 
        exceed available water resources.</p>
      <p>Fish and other marine stocks are a key area of concern in the polar regions. 
        Under <i>Markets First</i>, massive increase in commercial harvesting 
        and abandonment of targeted fisheries leads to some fish populations crashing. 
        Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities cease in <i>Security 
        First </i>under direct pressure from powerful regulatory interests, but 
        controlled exploitation rises to very high levels. Total collapse of any 
        single fishery is averted under <i>Policy First </i>by enforcement of 
        stringent harvesting quotas and other regulatory systems. In <i>Sustainability 
        First</i>, fish and marine mammals are rigorously defended against overexploitation.</p>
      <p>The environmental implications of the various scenarios illustrate the 
        legacy of past decades and the level of effort that will be needed to 
        reverse powerful trends. One of the major policy lessons from the scenarios 
        is that there can be significant delays between changes in human behaviour, 
        including policy choices, and their environmental impacts, specifically: 
      </p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>Much of the environmental change that will occur over the next 30 
          years has already been set in motion by past and current actions. </li>
        <li>Many of the effects of environmentally relevant policies put into 
          place over the next 30 years will not be apparent until long afterwards.</li>
