      <p>The Mashriq and GCC countries have different sets of pollution-related 
        pressures to contend with. Whereas in the GCC countries the challenges 
        are from oilrelated industries and desalinization plants, in the Mashriq 
        the challenge is primarily from major rivers that discharge domestic and 
        municipal wastes, agricultural chemicals and hazardous industrial substances 
        into the sea.</p>
      <p>Due to heavy oil traffic in the Gulf, and the Gulf's unique geographical 
        location and sensitive biological nature, this sea could become the most 
        polluted in the world unless strict measures are implemented and enforced. 
        The Gulf and the Red Sea are the oil tanker highways of the world: more 
        than 10 000 vessels a year pass through the Straits of Hormuz, about 60 
        per cent of which are oil tankers (ROPME 1999), and some 34 offshore oil 
        and gas terminals exist in the region (UNEP 1999). About 1.2 million barrels 
        of oil are spilled in the region every year from routine discharge of 
        ballast water (UNEP 1999). Since 1996, facilities for treating oil-contaminated 
        ballast water have been established in the ROPME area, and a task force 
        involving the GCC secretariat, the International Maritime Organization, 
        UNDP, UNEP and the EU was set up through the Marine Emergency Mutual Aid 
        Centre. A regional steering committee was established and a schedule for 
        implementation of oil reception facilities is now under way (Al-Janahi 
        2001).</p>
      <p>More than 360 million tonnes of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean 
        Sea (EEA 1999) which, though constituting only 0.7 per cent of the global 
        sea surface, receives 17 per cent of global marine oil pollution (ESCWA 
        1991). Around 2 000 vessels, of which 250-300 are oil tankers, cruise 
        the Mediterranean daily. It is estimated that more than 22 000 tonnes 
        of oil entered the Mediterranean during 1987-96 as a result of shipping 
        incidents (EEA 1999).</p>
      <p>Regional wars have also contributed to the degradation of coastal and 
        marine resources. The Iran/Iraq war (1980-88) contributed 2-4 million 
        barrels of spilled oil (Reynolds 1993) and 6-8 million barrels were spilled 
        into the Gulf and the Arabian Sea during the Second Gulf War (ROPME 2000).</p>
      <p>The region has made some advances in combating accidental oil spills, 
        particularly in the PERSGA and ROPME countries but in the Mashriq countries 
        and some countries in the PERSGA region, there are no mechanisms to deal 
        with major catastrophes (UNEP and PERSGA 1997). For example, there are 
        no emergency contingency plans to deal with accidents to the 30-odd oil 
        pipelines in Lebanon (Government of Lebanon 1997).</p>
      <p>Most countries in the region have recognized pollution from land-based 
        sources as a major threat to the coastal and marine environment. Sewage 
        disposal is a major issue. Most coastal cities in the Mashriq sub-region 
        have outdated sewerage systems, and the discharge of untreated sewage 
        into coastal zones, mainly close to the major cities, continues to be 
        common practice in most of the Mashriq and some parts of the GCC countries. 
        Elsewhere, as in Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and western Saudi 
        Arabia, all sewage is treated prior to discharge and some is recycled. 
        The risk of eutrophication in semiclosed and closed areas is constantly 
        present since most of the seas in the region are oligotrophic (poor in 
        nutrients).</p>
      <p>Discharges from desalinization plants of brine, chlorine and heat continue 
        to pose another serious threat to the environment. Nearly 43 per cent 
        of the world's desalinated water is produced in GCC countries (UNEP and 
        PERSGA 1997) and the trend is increasing.</p>
      <p>Soil erosion and sedimentation pose another threat to the coastal zone. 
        With an annual estimated soil loss of about 33 and 60 tonnes/ha in Lebanon 
        and Syria respectively, the amount of eroded soil discharged into the 
        Mediterranean from both countries may reach 60 million tonnes annually 
        (EEA 1999). In the absence of adequate river basin management programmes, 
        riverine and estuarine water quality will continue to deteriorate with 
        harmful effects on public health. It is expected that, following the completion 
        of new dams in eastern Turkey, there will be a change in water quantity 
        and quality of the Euphrates River flowing into Syria and Iraq, which 
        in turn will have a major impact on the agricultural areas and estuaries 
        of the Shatt Al-Arab waterways.</p>
      <p>Although there is great variation in levels of heavy metals in the region, 
        screening tests show acceptable values in most areas (UNEP MAP 1996, ROPME 
        1999). Some countries have begun setting standards for environmental quality 
        through international and regional agreements. For example, Lebanon has 
        recently started to develop environmental and developmental indicators 
        and standards within the framework of the Barcelona Convention. Pollution 
        from land-based activities has also been incorporated into protocols in 
        both the Mediterranean and the Kuwait Action Plans.</p>
