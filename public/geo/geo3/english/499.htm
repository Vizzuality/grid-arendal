      <p>Although everyone is vulnerable to environmental impacts of some kind, 
        the ability of people and societies to adapt to and cope with change is 
        very varied. Developing countries, particularly the least developed, have 
        less capacity to adapt to change and are more vulnerable to environmental 
        threats and global change, just as they are more vulnerable to other stresses. 
        This condition is most extreme among the poorest people (IPCC 2001) and 
        disadvantaged groups such as women and children.</p>
      <p>The coping capacity of human society is a combination of all the natural 
        and social characteristics and resources available in a particular location 
        that are used to reduce the impacts of hazards (IATFDR 2001). These include 
        factors such as wealth, technology, education, information, skills, infrastructure, 
        access to resources and management capabilities. Between two and three 
        times as many disaster events were reported in the United States in 1999 
        as in India or Bangladesh but there were 14 times and 34 times more deaths 
        in India and in Bangladesh, respectively, than in the United States (UNEP 
        2000). The critical factor behind these statistics lies in the advantages 
        enjoyed by US citizens in terms of levels of coping capacity (see also 
        Chapter 2, <a href="446.htm">'Disasters'</a>). There is, therefore, no 
        direct correlation between the occurrence of extreme events and their 
        level of human impact.</p>
      <p>In many instances, coping capacity that was adequate in the past has 
        not kept pace with environmental change. This can happen when traditional 
        options are reduced or eliminated (the settlement of nomads, the introduction 
        of regulations restricting resource use that was previously free), or 
        when new threats emerge for which no coping mechanism exists, resources 
        are lacking, and technology and skills are not available.</p>
      <p>Some groups are more exposed than others to particular environmental 
        risks: urban populations are exposed to high levels of contaminant and 
        particulate pollution in the air, slum dwellers often lack the minimum 
        protective infrastructure, employees may be exposed to particular hazards 
        in the work place, and the uninformed may simply not know about the threats 
        that surround them. A wide range of social and economic factors have direct 
        and indirect bearing on human vulnerability to environmental change, including 
        poverty and inequality, and the availability of natural resources. No 
        standard framework exists for identifying all these factors.</p>
      <p>Poverty is generally recognized as one of the most important causes of 
        vulnerability to environmental threats, on the basis that the poor tend 
        to have much lower coping capacities, and thus they bear a disproportionate 
        burden of the impact of disasters, conflict, drought, desertification 
        and pollution. But poverty is not the only reason. The very young and 
        the old, women and children are often identified as especially vulnerable 
        groups. Refugees, migrants and other displaced groups lack both the physical 
        resources and social structure necessary to respond to threats although 
        paradoxically they may initially benefit from the high visibility of their 
        plight. The urban poor, on the other hand, usually live in obscurity, 
        and in times of disaster their numbers can swell enormously. The mosaics 
        of vulnerability seem so complex as to cast doubt on attempts to describe 
        patterns and estimate trends at the global or even the regional scale. 
        General or gradual economic decline can affect vulnerable groups disproportionately, 
        creating severe but largely hidden hardships (Downing and Bakker 2000).</p>
      <p>The cultural dimension is important. Indigenous communities with unique 
        lifestyles intimately adapted to local climate, vegetation and wildlife 
        may be particularly threatened by environmental change (see box below). 
        Traditionally, many indigenous communities developed highly specific coping 
        mechanisms to deal with their environments and periodic extreme events. 
        Such coping mechanisms included adaptive behaviour such as regular seasonal 
        migration or exceptional relocation in times of flooding or drought, and 
        changes in practices such as planting and gathering specific food crops; 
        for example, fruits and foods that are not usually eaten during times 
        of good harvests may be relied upon in times of crop failure. With the 
        breakdown of social patterns, and reduction of options to continue following 
        indigenous lifestyles, such coping mechanisms are also giving way or disappearing.</p>

          <td>The culture of the indigenous peoples of the Mackenzie basin in 
            northwest Canada is threatened by climate change. Over the past 35 
            years, temperatures have increased rapidly by about 1ºC a decade, 
            with significant results such as melting permafrost, increasing numbers 
            of landslips and forest fires, and decreasing groundwater levels. 
            More frequent forest fires will reduce traditionally important terrestrial, 
            aquatic and bird species. Because of a decrease in water availability, 
            muskrats have already disappeared from the Peace Athabasca delta. 
            Changes such as these in the ecosystem and resource base jeopardize 
            the sustainability of traditional lifestyles that are dependent on 
            wildlife harvested by hunting, fishing and trapping as a prime source 
            of food, income and traditional clothing.</td>

      <p>Poor and indigenous communities are considered to be more vulnerable 
        to climate-related events such as storms, floods and droughts because 
        of inadequacies in social support services and systems such as water management 
        infrastructure (IPCC 2001). They are also more affected by pests and diseases 
        - especially vector-borne, respiratory and other infectious diseases (Woodward 
        and others 1998, Braaf 1999). In addition, since many poor inhabit isolated 
        rural environments or the margins of large towns and cities, they are 
        more exposed to social problems associated with economic insecurity, inadequate 
        water supplies and lower health standards.</p>
