      <p>Some of the direct pressures leading to degradation have been agricultural 
        expansion, intensification and overgrazing in arid lands (Dregne 1986, 
        Gold 1999). These practices can cause erosion by water and wind, and chemical 
        and physical degradation (Eswaran, Lal and Reich 2001). Socio-economic 
        drivers include large federal subsidies, increasing global demand for 
        agricultural products and increased trade liberalization (MacGregor and 
        McRae 2000). </p>

            <p>The US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was enacted in 1985 and 
              expanded in 1990 to help farmers retire cropland that was environmentally 
              sensitive or susceptible to erosion for 10 years in return for rental 
              and cost-sharing payments and technical assistance. The aim was 
              to reduce erosion and excess production. As of October 1999, 12.5 
              million ha of cropland were enrolled in the CRP (Zinn 1994, H. John 
              Heinz III Center 1999).</p>
            <p>In Canada, the Permanent Cover Program (PCP), first delivered in 
              1989 by the federal Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, 
              aims to reduce soil deterioration on cropland at high risk of soil 
              damage by maintaining permanent cover of grass and trees. Although 
              the programme has limited funds, only applies for a short period 
              and restricts the amount of land each farmer can retire, some C$2-5 
              million of soil productivity has been saved by permanent cover on 
              320 000 ha of land (Tyrchniewicz and Wilson 1994, Vaisey, Weins 
              and Wettlaufer 1996).</p>

      <p><a name="fig83"></a>Lessons learned from the Dust Bowl experiences of 
        the 1930s led to the adoption of soil conservation strategies such as 
        contour ploughing, no-till methods, reduced summer fallow and increased 
        crop residues. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, both countries reported 
        on the status of their nation's soil. These reports led to the US Soil 
        and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 and Canada's 1989 National 
        Soil Conservation Program (Vaisey, Weins and Wettlaufer 1996, USDA 1996). 
        They also adopted strategies that took fragile lands out of agricultural 
        production to protect them from erosion (see box).</p>
      <p>Conservation measures have led to significant declines in erosion over 
        the past 30 years. In the United States, 30 per cent of croplands had 
        highly erosion-prone conditions in 1982 compared to 24 per cent in 1992 
        (H. John Heinz III Center 1999, Huffman 2000, Padbury and Stushnoff 2000).</p>
      <p>Data for other indices of land degradation are scarce: consistent US 
        data for the national level of organic matter, the degree of soil compaction 
        and the amount of land affected by salt are lacking (H. John Heinz III 
        Center 1999). Conservation practices in Canada appear to have led to a 
        decline in the rate of organic carbon loss from 70 kg/ha in 1970 to 43 
        kg/ha in 1990 (Smith and others 2000).</p>
      <p>Desertification has generally been stabilized over the past 30 years 
        as plant cover on rangelands has improved, and erosion and waterlogging 
        have been controlled (Dregne 1986, UNCCD 2001). In the mid- 1980s, salinization 
        was estimated to affect about 25 per cent of the irrigated land in the 
        United States, and conditions in heavily irrigated agricultural areas 
        of the dry US southwest continue to worsen (de Villiers 2000). In Canada, 
        only 2 per cent of agricultural land has more than 15 per cent of its 
        area affected by salinity (Environment Canada 1996).</p>
      <p>Historically, government agricultural policy focused on economic and 
        production goals but sustainability has guided policy reforms in the recent 
        past (MacGregor and McRae 2000). The Canadian Agri-Environmental Indicator 
        project, completed in 2000, contributed to a more informed debate about 
        agricultural sustainability, and the 1985 and 1990 US <i>Farm Bills</i> 
        led to more sustainable stewardship by farmers and landowners (McRae, 
        Smith and Gregorich 2000, NRCS 2000). In 1994, the US Task Force on Sustainable 
        Agriculture set out recommendations to achieve environmentally and socially 
        sound agricultural production and, two years later, the Federal Agriculture 
        Improvement and Reform Act was signed expanding on earlier conservation 
        themes (Gold 1999). The Canadian government set out its strategy for sustainable 
        agriculture in 1997 (AAFC 1997).</p>
