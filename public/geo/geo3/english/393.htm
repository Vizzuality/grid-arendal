      <p>The level of industrialization in West Asia is low in comparison with 
        Europe and the United States but population growth, urbanization and an 
        increase in oilrelated industries and other industrial activities have 
        resulted in air pollution 'hot spots'. In the major cities and industrial 
        compounds of West Asia, concentrations of the main air pollutants often 
        exceed WHO guidelines by a factor of two to five (World Bank 1995).</p>
      <p>The burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of atmospheric air pollution 
        and the main source of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It accounts 
        for all West Asia's commercial primary energy production which increased 
        from 665.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1972 to 974.2 mtoe 
        in 1997, while energy consumption increased from 27.0 to 229.5 mtoe over 
        the same period (compiled from IEA 1999).</p>

          <td>The cement industry, the major industrial source of CO<sub>2</sub> 
            emissions in the Mashriq sub-region, also emits large amounts of dust, 
            covering nearby vegetation, endangering human health and ecosystems. 
            In Lebanon, the cement industry is responsible for 77.2 per cent of 
            all industrial emissions (Government of Lebanon 1998). In Syria, particulate 
            emissions from one cement company near Damascus result in SPM levels 
            exceeding guidelines within a radius of 3 km. This has caused thoracic 
            and respiratory diseases among workers and nearby communities (CAMRE 
            and UNEP 1997).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The main sources of air pollution in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
        countries are oil refineries, oil gathering centres, oil platforms, petrochemical 
        and fertilizer plants, and motor vehicles. In the Mashriq countries, outdated 
        technologies especially in power generation plants, fertilizer plants, 
        smelters and cement factories have caused deterioration of air quality 
        not only in industrial sites but also in nearby settlements. Amongst the 
        air pollutants emitted, SPM is of great concern with levels well above 
        maximum allowable concentrations. The economic loss due to the impact 
        of poor air quality on human health in Syria is estimated at about US$188 
        million per year (World Bank and UNDP 1998). However, recent trends in 
        West Asia, and especially in the GCC countries, are towards adopting cleaner 
        production approaches in industry, especially in the large oil, petrochemical, 
        fertilizer and metal industries.</p>

      <p><a name="fig233"></a>The increasing number of vehicles, poor traffic 
        management, ageing cars and congested roads in major cities add to the 
        level of air pollution. Many vehicles are in poor condition and about 
        30 per cent are older than 15 years and produce significantly higher emissions 
        of hydrocarbons and NO<sub>x</sub> than new ones (World Bank and UNDP 
        1998). Furthermore, leaded petrol is still in use in many countries, compounding 
        health problems in cities and along major highways (World Bank 1995). 
        To cope with this problem, some countries have taken measures to phase 
        out leaded gasoline. Unleaded gasoline has been introduced to the GCC 
        countries and Lebanon, and is the only fuel produced in Bahrain since 
        July 2000 (BAPCO 2000).</p>
      <p>Along with atmospheric pollution caused by human activities, seasonal 
        sand and dust storms contribute to air pollution in West Asia in general 
        and along the northern coasts of the Arabian (Persian) Gulf in particular 
        (ROPME 1999). The dust storms absorb pollutants such as pesticides and 
        can transport them for long distances with adverse effects on the environment, 
        the economy and quality of life. It is estimated that the annual amount 
        of dust fall-out along the coastal area of Kuwait may reach 1 000 tonnes/km<sup>2</sup> 
        with an overall mean concentration of 200 µg/m<sup>3</sup> 
        (Khalaf and others 1980, EPA 1996).</p>
      <p>Transboundary air pollution is an emerging issue in the region. Stricter 
        measures and regulations to control emissions, to promote the use of modern 
        and efficient technologies, and towards restructuring the price of energy 
        resources must be taken to curb air pollution. Energy efficiency programmes 
        in the power, petroleum, transportation, industrial, agriculture and residential 
        sectors are needed to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions 
        of greenhouse gases.</p>
