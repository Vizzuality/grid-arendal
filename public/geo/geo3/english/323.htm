      <p>Coastal and marine habitats are being physically eroded and biologically 
        degraded through unsustainable rates of resource extraction (including 
        intensive commercial fishing, mining of sand dunes and clearing of mangrove 
        forests). The harvesting methods are also damaging, as in coral extraction 
        and the use of dynamite in fishing. Activities further inland, such as 
        damming of rivers, increased use of fertilizers and clearing of natural 
        vegetation, also affect the coastal zone. Population growth and migration 
        to the coast, together with rapidly expanding tourism and industrial activities, 
        encourage high rates of infrastructure development, modifying the physical 
        and ecological environment of the coastal zone. Lack of formal protection, 
        sustainable development policies and inadequate resources to implement 
        coastal and marine management have contributed to the pressures, although 
        the situation in many countries is now changing.</p>
      <p>Coastal drift (erosion and deposition of dunes, beaches and shoreline) 
        is a natural phenomenon but human action can alter natural patterns. Clearing 
        of forests and natural vegetation inland leads to increased soil erosion 
        and increased sediment load in rivers. Sediment is eventually deposited 
        on the seabed, smothering benthic communities and coral reefs. In contrast, 
        when rivers are dammed upstream, sediment settles before reaching the 
        river mouth, thus depriving coastal zones of sediment. In Western Africa, 
        damming of the Upper Niger, Benue and Volta rivers has altered the flow 
        reaching the Niger Delta, and local subsidence is proceeding at 25 mm 
        per year (World Bank 1996). In Ghana, construction of the Akosombo dam 
        in 1965 accelerated coastal erosion west of Accra to 6 metres per year, 
        and in Togo and Benin coastal retreat has exceeded 150 metres over the 
        past 20 years (UNEP 1999).</p>
      <p>In Northern Africa, 40-50 per cent of the population in the Mediterranean 
        countries lives in coastal areas (UNEP 1996), with population densities 
        reaching 500-1 000 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> along the Nile Delta (Blue 
        Plan 1996). In Western Africa, about onethird of the total population 
        is concentrated on a coastal band 60-km wide between Senegal and Cameroon, 
        and large-scale urban growth has occurred from Accra to the Niger Delta, 
        an environmentally sensitive portion of the African coastline.</p>

      <p><a name="fig189"></a>The coastal zone is also receiving increasing numbers 
        of tourists - in South Africa, for example, the industry grew at 7 per 
        cent a year during the late 1990s (SADC 2000). According to FAO (1998), 
        38 per cent of Africa's coastal ecosystems are under high levels of threat 
        from development-related activities. The exceptional demand for infrastructure 
        development often results in uncoordinated and poorly planned or sited 
        construction which can in turn cause habitat loss, destabilization or 
        mining of dunes for construction materials, and draining of coastal wetlands. 
        Economic costs are further inflated as governments and investors have 
        to spend large budgets on mitigation and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>The demand for fisheries resources is also increasing. The marine fisheries 
        of Africa have developed significantly over the past 30 years, and most 
        demersal stocks are now thought to be fully exploited (FAO 1996, FAO 1997). 
        The fishery sector contributes more than 5 per cent to GDP in Ghana, Madagascar, 
        Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal and Seychelles, and the 
        shrimp fishery on the Sofala Bank in Mozambique contributes 40 per cent 
        of the country's foreign exchange (FAO 1997). From 1973 to 1990, fisheries 
        supplied some 20 per cent of the animal protein intake of the population 
        of sub-Saharan Africa. However, per capita fish catch (see figure above) 
        has been fairly static since 1972, except in Southern Africa where it 
        has fallen sharply (FAO 1996, FAO 1997). The Cape rock lobster and abalone 
        catches have declined steadily since the 1950s, causing concern over the 
        sustainability of these populations and leading to the setting of annual 
        catch limits (FAO 1997).</p>
      <p>In Southern Africa, declining catches, together with a decrease in the 
        mean sizes of fish caught, have led to calls for the protection of line 
        fish stocks. Today fisheries management measures include minimum size 
        limits, bag limits, use of appropriate fishing gear, closed seasons, control 
        agreements with foreign fleets and establishment of marine reserves. In 
        Western Africa, a Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme aims to 
        develop social and human capital in fisheriesdependent communities, whilst 
        enhancing natural habitats in those communities.</p>

          <td>The Convention for the Protection, Management, and Development of 
            the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region (Nairobi 
            Convention) of 1985 is a UNEP Regional Seas Programme initiative, 
            under which the erosionassociated impacts on ecosystems and species 
            are dealt with proactively. Although all affected countries are party 
            to the convention, it is not legally binding, and has received insufficient 
            funding for application of many of the activities. National efforts 
            to regulate coastal development include the introduction of integrated 
            coastal management policies, requirements for environmental impact 
            assessments to be conducted, and establishment of marine national 
            parks. The Indian Ocean Commission has facilitated the development 
            of a Regional Sustainable Development Policy and a coral reef monitoring 
            and action programme. In Central and Southern Africa, most countries 
            have, or are preparing, Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plans. 
            Africa is the top regional recipient of GEF biodiversity funds, about 
            one-third of which are directed towards projects in coastal, marine 
            and freshwater ecosystems.</td>
