      <p>Prior to 1972, the crash of some seabird populations caused by DDT, outbreaks 
        of Minamata disease in Japan from mercury-contaminated seafood, and the 
        <i>Torrey Canyon</i> and other oil spills focused the attention of the 
        Stockholm Conference on marine pollution. Policy responses included bans 
        on production and use of some substances, regulations to reduce discharges, 
        and the prohibition of ocean dumping, as well as a significant scientific 
        effort to improve the status of knowledge about these pollutants. These 
        responses are enshrined in a number of international agreements, including 
        the 1972 London Dumping Convention and its 1996 Protocol, the 1989 Basel 
        Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes 
        and their Disposal, and the 1995 Global Programme of Action for the Protection 
        of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities. Marine pollution 
        is also an important focus of UNEP's Regional Seas Programmes that have 
        been established in many parts of the world.</p>
      <p>Globally, sewage remains the largest source of contamination, by volume, 
        of the marine and coastal environment (GESAMP 2001a), and coastal sewage 
        discharges have increased dramatically in the past three decades. In addition, 
        because of the high demand for water in urban neighbourhoods, water supply 
        tends to outstrip the provision of sewerage, increasing the volume of 
        wastewater.</p>

      <p>Public health problems from the contamination of coastal waters with 
        sewage-borne pathogens were well known in the 1970s, and in many developed 
        countries improved sewage treatment and reduction of the disposal of industrial 
        and some domestic contaminants into municipal systems have significantly 
        improved water quality. In the developing world, however, the provision 
        of basic sanitation, as well as urban sewer systems and sewage treatment, 
        has not kept pace. High capital costs, the explosive pace of urbanization, 
        and in many cases limited technical, administrative and financial capacities 
        for urban planning and management and ongoing operation of sewage treatment 
        systems are barriers to efficient sewage treatment (GESAMP 2001a). Removal 
        of these barriers, as well as alternative approaches, is urgently needed.</p>
      Recent evidence suggests that bathing in waters well within current microbiological 
      standards still poses significant risk of gastrointestinal disease, and 
      that sewage contamination of marine waters is a health problem of global 
      proportions (see box, GESAMP 2001a, WHO 1998). 
      <p>A primary concern at the Stockholm Conference was the introduction of 
        nutrients to coastal and marine waters. Human activities now account for 
        more than half of global nitrogen fixation (Vitousek and others 1997a), 
        and the supply of fixed nitrogen to the oceans has greatly increased. 
        Sewage discharges are often the dominant local source near urban areas 
        but global inputs are dominated by agricultural run-off and atmospheric 
        deposition. The highest rates of riverine transport of dissolved inorganic 
        nitrogen to estuaries from all sources occur in Europe and in South and 
        East Asia (Seitzinger and Kroeze 1998). Nitrogen levels are exacerbated 
        by widespread loss of natural interceptors such as coastal wetlands, coral 
        reefs and mangrove forests.</p>
      <p>At the time of Stockholm, agricultural nutrient run-off was 'not yet 
        a major global problem'. Most fertilizer use was in developed countries 
        but the rapid increase of fertilizer use in developing countries was already 
        foreseen (SCEP 1970). Fertilizer use has stabilized in developed countries 
        but is increasing in developing ones (Socolow 1999), a trend expected 
        to continue. Fertilizer use has undoubtedly been enhanced by widespread 
        subsidies, which reflect the high political priority of increasing food 
        production and reducing food costs.</p>

      <p><a name="fig182"></a>Atmospheric inputs, derived primarily from vehicle 
        and industrial emissions and in some areas evaporation from animal manure 
        and fertilizer, dominate anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to some coastal 
        areas. They are expected to rise with increasing industrialization and 
        vehicle use, especially in developing regions (GESAMP in prep.). Atmospheric 
        nitrogen inputs to the nitrogen-limited open oceans will also increase, 
        with potential significant impacts on primary production and the carbon 
        cycle.</p>
      <p>Marine and coastal eutrophication from elevated nitrogen inputs has emerged 
        as a worrying trend not foreseen three decades ago. There is increasing 
        evidence that blooms of toxic or otherwise undesirable phytoplankton are 
        increasing in frequency, intensity and geographic distribution (Richardson 
        1997). Severe eutrophication has occurred in several enclosed or semi-enclosed 
        seas, including the Black Sea (Zaitsev and Mamaev 1997, Balkas and others 
        1990). Elsewhere, elevated growth and subsequent decay of phytoplankton 
        has caused widespread areas of seasonally oxygendepleted water (see map 
        above). Phytoplankton blooms can have major economic impacts on fisheries, 
        aquaculture and tourism (see table below). </p>
      <p>At the time of the Stockholm Conference concerns for ocean health centred 
        on pollution by POPs (particularly DDT and PCBs), heavy metals and oil 
        (Goldberg 1976, Matthews and others 1971, UN 1972a, SCEP 1970). Some response 
        measures have been effective, for example, introduction of unleaded gasoline 
        helped to reduce lead levels in Bermuda (Wu and Boyle 1997, Huang, Arimoto 
        and Rahn 1996); national regulations and international agreements such 
        as the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) resulted 
        in the reduction of operational oil discharges from ships; and North American 
        seabird populations affected by DDT recovered after this chemical was 
        banned in the region.</p>
      <p>In other cases, improved information has clarified some concerns. High 
        levels of mercury in tuna and swordfish, for example, have been shown 
        to have natural sources; the most dramatic effects of oil spills have 
        proved to be localized and relatively transient; and heavy metal contamination, 
        except for lead and mercury, has been found to be highly localized and 
        has relatively minor impacts except at high concentrations.There are, 
        however, other continuing concerns about these pollutants. The chemical 
        residues of oil spills may have subtle long-term effects (Heintz, Short 
        and Rice 1999), and chronic, small releases cause seabird mortality and 
        other environmental effects (GESAMP in prep.). The effects of heavy metal 
        contamination can be severe and are a significant concern in the Arctic 
        (AMAP 1998).</p>

      <p>The most serious concerns globally relate to POPs, many of which are 
        transported globally via the atmosphere and are ubiquitous in the oceans. 
        There is growing evidence that long-term, low-level exposures to some 
        POPs cause reproductive, immunological, neurological and other problems 
        in marine organisms, and possibly in humans, but the evidence for widespread 
        ecological or human health impacts at current levels of contamination 
        remains equivocal.</p>
      <p>Another threat to the oceans, and in particular to living organisms, 
        is non-biodegradable litter which enters the sea. Each year, large numbers 
        of seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals are killed by entanglement 
        in or ingestion of non-biodegradable litter.</p>
      <p>Human-induced changes in the natural flow of sediment have emerged since 
        the Stockholm Conference as a major threat to coastal habitats. Urban 
        and industrial development drives the construction of residential and 
        industrial infrastructure which, depending on its nature, can alter sediment 
        flow. In addition, agriculture, deforestation and construction typically 
        mobilize sediments. Deltas, mangrove forests, beaches and other coastal 
        habitats are sustained by the supply of sediment, while other habitats, 
        such as coral reefs and seagrass beds, may be smothered or deprived of 
        light. Sedimentation is one of the major global threats to reefs, particularly 
        in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and South and Southeast Asia (Bryant and 
        others 1998, Wilkinson 2000).</p>
