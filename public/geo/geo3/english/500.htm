        locations, such as high latitudes (see box below), floodplains, river 
        banks, small islands and coastal areas, may pose more risk than others. 
        Human uses or modifications of the environment such as deforestation, 
        increasing paved areas covered by buildings and roads, and river canalization 
        have created impacts that often affect areas a long way from the source

            melanoma (skin cancer). The prevalence of this condition has increased 
            dramatically in the 20th century and has been attributed to increased 
            ultraviolet (UV) radiation resulting from ozone depletion, caused 
            mainly by industrialized countries. Changes in behaviour, such as 
            increasingly outdoor lifestyles and sunbathing, are contributory factors. 
            In the year 2000, 78.5 per cent of melanoma cases, and 73 per cent 
            of melanoma-related deaths reported worldwide, were in developed countries 
            (Ferlay and others 2001). In the United States, there has been a 1 
            800 per cent rise in reported cases of malignant melanoma since 1930. 
            One in five Americans develops skin cancer, and one American dies 
            of it every hour (US EPA 1998).</td>

      <p>Individual choices have an enormous bearing on where people live and 
        work, with the result that human vulnerability is closely related to population 
        density and distribution. Floodplains, low-lying coastal areas and volcanic 
        areas have always been favoured for settlement because of their soil fertility 
        or the availability of flat land. As populations increase and there is 
        more competition for land and resources, areas of higher potential risk 
        are increasingly being settled, such as mountains, steep slopes and locations 
        near sources of pollution. Such settlers are vulnerable to the associated 
        single or combined hazards such as landslides, flooding, volcanic eruptions 
        and toxic chemicals. Again, the poorest strata of society are often the 
        most vulnerable because they have fewer options in where to live.</p>
      <p>For various reasons, even the more affluent often choose to live or work 
        in areas prone to environmental threats or hazards. Those living along 
        the earthquakeprone San Andreas fault in California are a prime example, 
        as are those who settle in hurricane belts, on sand spits, on eroding 
        coastlines or in towns where water supplies are inadequate to meet demand. 
        Clearly, the benefits of the location (employment, job security, leisure 
        facilities) are perceived to outweigh the known risks. Measures to mitigate 
        the risks may be sought in the form of insurance or purchasing a scarce 
        commodity such as water but these options are not always appropriate, 
        available or affordable to all members of the community.</p>

            <p>Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are catastrophic discharges 
              of water resulting primarily from melting glaciers.</p>
            <p>Global warming over the past half century has led to an accelerated 
              retreat of the glaciers and enlargement of several glacial lakes 
              in the Hindu Kush and Tibetan Himalayas. In Bhutan, for example, 
              some glaciers are retreating at a rate of 20-30 metres a year. Many 
              glacial lakes are dammed by unstable moraines. Occasionally these 
              dams burst and release large amounts of stored water, causing serious 
              flooding downstream and along the river channel. The water contains 
              substantial debris and causes serious damage - often at great distances 
              from the outburst source; in Pakistan, damage has occurred 1 300 
              km from the outburst source. Such flash floods are a common problem 
              in countries such as Bhutan, China (Tibet), India, Nepal and Pakistan.</p>
            <p>In Nepal, records indicate that GLOFs occur once every three to 
              ten years. Over the past few decades at least 12 GLOFs have caused 
              major damage to infrastructure. For example, Dig Tsho glacial lake 
              in Bhutan burst on 4 August 1985, causing significant loss of life 
              and destroying the nearly completed Namche hydropower plant, as 
              well as 14 bridges.</p>

      <p>In 2002, more than 1 billion urban dwellers, mostly in Africa, Asia and 
        Latin America, live in slums or as squatters UNCHS 2001). Of the projected 
        1 billion new urban dwellers by 2010, most will probably be absorbed by 
        cities in developing countries that already face multiple problems such 
        as shortages of adequate housing, infrastructure, potable water supplies, 
        adequate sanitation and transportation systems as well as environmental 
        pollution. The urban poor, unable to afford alternatives, are frequently 
        forced to live in areas with the worst urban services and most unhealthy 
        environmental conditions, exposed to multiple hazards and increased risk, 
        their vulnerability enhanced by overcrowding.</p>
      <p>Some communities have become more vulnerable because the scarcity of 
        critical resources such as land, fresh water and forests is contributing 
        to conflicts. These environmental scarcities do not usually cause wars 
        among countries but they can generate severe social stresses within countries 
        or across borders, helping to stimulate sub-national insurgencies, ethnic 
        clashes and urban unrest. Such civil violence affects developing societies 
        particularly because they are generally more dependent on environmental 
        resources and less able to buffer themselves from the social crisis that 
        environmental scarcities cause (Homer- Dixon 1999).</p>

            <p>An estimated 30 million people depend on Lake Victoria, a lake 
              whose natural resources are under increasing stress. The population 
              on the shore has grown fast over the past century with corresponding 
              increases in the demand for fish and agricultural products. Following 
              the introduction of gill nets by European settlers at the beginning 
              of the 20th century, populations of indigenous fish species declined. 
              Many were specially adapted to eat algae, decaying plant material, 
              and snails that host the larvae of Schistosomes that cause bilharzia 
              in humans. The lake started to eutrophicate and people became more 
              vulnerable to disease.</p>
            <p>As fish catches declined, non-native species were introduced, so 
              causing further stress to indigenous fish. The greatest impact resulted 
              from the introduction of nile perch (<i>Lates niloticus</i>) in 
              the 1960s, as the basis of commercial freshwater fisheries. This 
              had repercussions on the local fishing economy and distribution 
              of wealth. Local people who previously met most of their protein 
              requirements from the lake began to suffer from malnutrition and 
              protein deficiency. Although 20 000 tonnes of fish are exported 
              annually to European and Asian markets, local people can afford 
              only fish heads and bones from which the flesh has been removed.</p>
            <p>Wetlands around the lake have been converted to grow rice, cotton 
              and sugarcane, and their function as natural filters for silt and 
              nutrients has been lost. Run-off now carries soil and excess nutrients 
              from the cultivated areas straight into the lake. The resulting 
              algal growth clouds the surface water and reduces oxygen availability, 
              seriously affecting the habitat of endemic fish species, which prefer 
              clear waters, while their predator, the nile perch, thrives in such 
              murky waters. This further aggravates food insecurity in lakeside 
              communities.</p>
            <p>Increased nutrients, much in the form of sewage, have stimulated 
              the growth of the water hyacinth (<i>Eichornia crassipes</i>), one 
              of the world's most invasive plants. This has seriously affected 
              water transport and paralysed many local fisheries. By the end of 
              1997, the 70 per cent decline in economic activity reported at Kisumu 
              port was attributable to water hyacinth choking the port and fish 
              landings. The dense cover of water hyacinth also stimulated secondary 
              weed growth, and provided habitats for snails and mosquitoes - this 
              in an area where the incidence of bilharzia and malaria is already 
              among the highest in the world.</p>
