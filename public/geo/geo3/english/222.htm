      <p class="global">The focus of conservation action has recently shifted 
        from protecting individual species to conserving habitats and ecosystems. 
        An illustration of how conservation plans are now conceived at broader 
        scales is provided by WWF International which recently developed priorities 
        for action at the scale of ecoregions (large areas of relatively uniform 
        climate that harbour a characteristic set of species and ecological communities). 
        Ecoregions of particular conservation importance include Lake Baikal in 
        Russia, the Australian Great Barrier Reef and the Atlantic forests of 
        Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
      <p class="global">Loss and degradation of habitat is the most important 
        factor causing loss of species. For example, conversion of forests or 
        grasslands into croplands results in the local extinction of plant and 
        animal species (Sala and others 2000). Worldwide about 1.2 million km<sup>2</sup> 
        of land have been converted to cropland in the past 30 years. In a recent 
        global survey, habitat loss was found to be the principal factor affecting 
        83 per cent of threatened mammals and 85 per cent of threatened birds 
        (Hilton-Taylor 2000, BirdLife International 2000). Habitat modification 
        arises from many different types of land use change including agricultural 
        development, logging, dam construction, mining and urban development.</p>
      <p class="global">Over the past three decades, major losses of virtually 
        every kind of natural habitat have occurred. For example, FAO assessments 
        show that between 1980 and 1995 forest cover in developing countries declined 
        by an estimated 2 million km<sup>2</sup> - an average annual loss of 130 
        000 km<sup>2</sup> (FAO 1999a). The most important causes of forest loss 
        included conversion toagriculture and development schemes involving resettlement. 
        As a result, habitats such as the tropical dry forests of Central America 
        have virtually disappeared (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). In terms 
        of loss of species, freshwater habitats are the most degraded, with some 
        20 per cent of freshwater species having become extinct or threatened 
        with extinction in recent decades (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). 
        The main causes of extinctions among freshwater fishes are declines in 
        habitat quality (Harrison and Stiassny 1999).</p>
      <p class="global">Dryland ecosystems, which cover more than onethird of 
        the world's land area, are particularly vulnerable to degradation. Statistics 
        indicate that more than 250 million people are directly affected by desertification 
        (UNCCD 2001). In 1977, 57 million people failed to produce enough food 
        to sustain themselves as a result of land degradation and by 1984 this 
        number had risen to 135 million (UNEP 1992). Impacts of degradation on 
        dryland biodiversity have not been comprehensively documented but substantial 
        changes have resulted from grazing of livestock, deforestation, introduction 
        of non-native species and conversion to croplands (UNEP 1995). In response, 
        the 1977 United Nations Conference on Desertification adopted a Plan of 
        Action to Combat Desertification. Despite this, assessments by UNEP (1992) 
        indicated that land degradation in many dryland areas had continued to 
        intensify. As a result the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 
        was developed, entering into force in 1996. This convention aims to promote 
        effective action through local programmes and international partnerships.</p>

      <p class="global"><a name="fig124"></a>Wetlands are areas where the water 
        table is at or near the surface of the land, or where the land is covered 
        by shallow water, and include areas of marsh, fen and peatland. Wetlands 
        play an important role in regulating water flow and are of exceptional 
        importance as habitats for large numbers of species. Wetland habitats 
        are also of high economic importance for provision of water and fisheries 
        (more than twothirds of the world's fish harvest is linked to coastal 
        and inland wetland areas). Concern about degradation and loss of wetland 
        habitats led to the development of the Convention on Wetlands of International 
        Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar) in 1971. The Ramsar 
        Convention provides a framework for national action and international 
        cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources 
        (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 1</a> for more information).</p>
      <p class="global">The designation of protected areas, such as national parks, 
        is one of the most widely used approaches for conserving habitats. In 
        addition to national parks, a total of 167 sites have now been designated 
        as natural heritage sites under the World Heritage Convention. The total 
        area of protected sites has increased continuously during the past three 
        decades from less than 3 million km<sup>2</sup> in 1970 to more than 12 million km<sup>2</sup> 
        by the late 1990s (Green and Paine 1997), indicating that there are continuing 
        efforts by governments to establish protected areas. Although the effectiveness 
        of protected areas for conserving biodiversity has been questioned, a 
        recent analysis of 93 protected areas around the world indicated that 
        most parks are successful at stopping land clearing and to a lesser extent 
        at mitigating logging, hunting, fire and grazing (Bruner and others 2001).</p>
      <p class="global">The most significant response to the biodiversity crisis 
        during the past 30 years has been the Convention on Biological Diversity 
        (CBD) which entered into force in December 1993 and had been signed by 
        182 Parties by December 2001. The convention has three main goals: the 
        conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of the components of biodiversity; 
        and sharing the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources in 
        a fair and equitable way (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 1</a>).</p>
      <p class="global">The CBD has resulted in major activity at both national 
        and international levels, and in the increased coordination of cross-sectoral 
        action within and between countries. However, major challenges remain 
        in increasing capacity to assess biodiversity and its value to people, 
        securing adequate financial resources for conservation actions, and building 
        political support for the changes necessary to ensure biodiversity conservation 
        and sustainable use.</p>
      <p class="global">It is clear from national reports that the implementation 
        of the convention is making progress in most countries, as illustrated 
        by preparation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, increasing 
        efforts to reform institutional and legislative arrangements, integration 
        of biodiversity into sectoral activities and increased recognition by 
        governments of the importance of the identification and monitoring of 
        biological diversity.</p>
      <p class="global">It is not yet possible to assess accurately the impacts 
        of the CBD on biodiversity, partly because the CBD has been in force for 
        only a short time. In addition, the parties to the convention have yet 
        to develop any globally applicable criteria and indicators by which overall 
        changes in biodiversity can be measured. It is clear that the convention 
        has had some impact at the policy level in many countries. What remains 
        difficult to assess is the depth of commitment to implementation and how 
        any such policy changes may result in changes in the state of biodiversity. 
        This issue is addressed in the strategic plan for the convention, currently 
        under discussion.</p>
