    <td class="contentText" valign="top"><!-- #BeginEditable "MainContent" -->The 
      world is now split into the haves and the havenots by four major divisions, 
      all of which continue to widen. These divisions became evident in the GEO-3 
      assessment and were addressed in the conclusions to <a href="081.htm">Chapter 
      2</a>. They are: 
      <ul class="global">
        <li>the environmental divide;</li>
        <li>the policy divide;</li>
        <li>the vulnerability gap; and</li>
        <li>the lifestyle divide.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These four divisions are a serious threat to sustainable development. 
        The environmental assessment in the preceding chapters shows that, despite 
        increased awareness of the environment, efforts to stem deterioration 
        have met with mixed results. There are notable successes and spectacular 
        failures. Over the past three decades, massive investments of human and 
        financial resources have been used to exploit the environment. On the 
        other hand, research has opened up new frontiers in terms of humanity's 
        understanding of the complex web of ecological processes.</p>
      <p>Policies have been introduced to address many of the key issues. Targets 
        have been set and met in some areas, such as the phase out of ozonedepleting 
        substances, but success has been limited in others, for example the adoption 
        of more stringent targets to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
        under the Kyoto Protocol. Many other initiatives critical to closing the 
        lifestyle divide and the success of sustainable development have been 
        identified. These include:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li><i>Alleviating poverty</i>. The international community has set a 
          target of halving by 2015 the proportion of the world population (currently 
          22 per cent) which survives on less than US$1 a day. The dayto- day 
          lives of the majority of the poor are much more closely linked to the 
          state of the environment than is the case for the better off - a healthy, 
          productive environment is one of the few stepping stones out of poverty. 
          As long as millions of the world's population remain poor, and the environment 
          stays on the periphery of mainstream policy making, sustainable development 
          will be an unachievable ideal.</li>
        <li><i>Reducing the excessive consumption of the more affluent</i>. As 
          long as the richest 20 per cent of the world population continues to 
          account for 86 per cent of total personal consumption expenditure, it 
          is unlikely that sustainable development will ever be achieved. The 
          resulting pockets of wealth in a sea of poverty heighten tensions and 
          overexploit resources.</li>
        <li><i>Improving governance</i> has become a major issue, not only at 
          the institutional and national levels, but also at the global level 
          where disparities between North and South often fuel conflict and intransigence 
          in negotiating policies for effective environmental management.</li>
        <li><i>Providing adequate funding</i> for environmental programmes is 
          a major factor. Inadequate resources have been blamed for the unsatisfactory 
          implementation of <i>Agenda 21</i>, and inaction may ultimately undermine 
          this blueprint for a sustainable future.</li>
        <li><i>Eliminating debt</i>, particularly for the Highly Indebted Poor 
          Countries, is also an important factor in a world in which debtor nations 
          often use more foreign currency to repay debts than they earn. Indebtedness 
          frequently leads to the overexploitation of the environment. As long 
          as this situation is perpetuated, many of the debtor nations are unlikely 
          to ever achieve sustainable development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many complex processes - social, economic and environmental - are at 
        play in terms of greater impacts on people as a result of environmental 
        change. Human vulnerability has been highlighted in Chapter 3, which emphasizes 
        that everyone is at risk in one way or another to environmental change. 
        The main difference is in coping capacity and ability to recover, and 
        this difference means that the poor are generally more vulnerable. This 
        vulnerability gap is undermining sustainable development. Human vulnerability 
        to environmental change encompasses the quality of the environment, threats 
        to that environment and the differing coping strategies of individuals 
        and communities in any location, country or region. Closing the vulnerability 
        gap would have a huge impact on the well-being and security of millions.</p>
      <p>Reducing and eliminating poverty are inextricably linked with sound environmental 
        management, which includes such issues as property and usage rights, the 
        provision of basic services to protect the environmental asset base, adequate 
        infrastructure, and funding for development and environment activities. 
        One way forward here would be for donors to give direct support to community-based 
        initiatives, especially those channelled towards sustainable development 
        activities, through funding channels accessible to low-income, disadvantaged 
        and vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p>Changes in consumption levels are needed by the more affluent individuals 
        and nations of the world. Prosperity is closely linked to the ability 
        to address environmental problems but it is also one of the forces behind 
        excessive consumption, which is the cause of other problems with far-reaching 
        impacts. Economic and political concerns have stalled attempts to change 
        consumption patterns through new policies or instruments. A realization 
        that changing consumption patterns does not have to curtail or prejudice 
        quality of life, and can in fact do the opposite, must be brought home 
        to the people concerned. There is sufficient evidence that this is the 
        case but no coordinated effort to get the message across has yet been 
        undertaken. Changing mindsets needs to go hand in hand with increased 
        acceptance of responsibility for environmental and social impacts, and 
        the creation of consumer ethics.</p>
      <p>The provision of financial resources is insufficient in the absence of 
        adequate capacity. Targeted capacity building and, more importantly, capacity 
        mobilization and retention to minimize the brain drain are needed for 
        more effective environmental governance and public participation. It is 
        particularly important to ensure that capacity development is a shared 
        experience rather than top-down or North-to-South instruction. With enhanced 
        capacity, developing regions may be better able to cope with environmental 
        change and disasters, which have increased their vulnerability.</p>
      <p>The following are some of the additional environment-related challenges 
        policy makers at all levels face over the coming decades:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>Large numbers of people, especially in developing countries, in both 
          rural and urban areas, still lack access to clean water and adequate 
          sanitation, good outdoor and indoor air quality, cleaner energy and 
          waste management. This continues to lead to the degradation of the natural 
          assets base, ill health and vulnerability to environmental threats.</li>
        <li>Unresolved conflicts remain over the ownership and management of common 
          property resources (such as water, air, land, forests and oceans).</li>
        <li>Highly complex environmental issues which are not yet adequately addressed 
          include the increasing prevalence of persistent toxic substances, unsafe 
          handling, disposal and dispersal of chemical and hazardous wastes, non-point 
          pollution sources, management of transboundary river systems and shared 
          water bodies, and excessive nitrogen loading.</li>
        <li>Climate change will cause inevitable damage in the medium and long 
          term (low-lying islands and coastal areas, arid and semi-arid ecosystems, 
          increased scale and intensity of environmental disasters). Developing 
          countries, particularly Small Island Developing states, are the least 
          able to adapt to events caused by climate change but are the most likely 
          to be affected by them.</li>
        <li>The global environmental impact (ecological footprint) of the developed 
          world and prosperous communities elsewhere is larger than that of the 
          poor in the developing world but future economic development and population 
          growth in the latter are likely to dramatically increase environmental 
          impacts.</li>
