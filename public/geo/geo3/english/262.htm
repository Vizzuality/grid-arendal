      <p>The Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem is structurally simplistic with a 
        small number of species. Marine biomass in the Southern Ocean can be immense 
        but species richness is generally low (Wynn Williams 1996). The benthic 
        (bottom) fish fauna of the continental and upper slope of Antarctica includes 
        213 species confined to 18 families (Eastman 2000). Seals, whales and 
        seabirds dominate the higher levels of the Southern Ocean. Knowledge of 
        Southern Ocean marine diversity is confined largely to the continental 
        shelves and slopes. Little is known about the fauna of the deep sea around 
        Antarctica.</p>
      <p>Historic sealing and whaling activities have had a significant impact 
        on these populations in the Southern Ocean, at one point threatening extinction 
        of some species. Today, strict international agreements govern the harvesting 
        of Antarctic seals (Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals) 
        and whales (International Whaling Convention, which also designated large 
        areas of the Southern Ocean as a whale sanctuary). Only limited numbers 
        of seals are taken for scientific purposes, while approximately 440 minke 
        whales are killed each year.</p>

      <p>Fish and krill (tiny planktonic crustaceans) are now primarily the targets 
        of human exploitation in the Southern Ocean. From 1969-70, when records 
        of commercial fishing began, to the end of 1998, a total of 8 739 800 
        tonnes of krill and fish had been taken from the Southern Ocean (CCAMLR 
        2000a). In 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine 
        Living Resources (CCAMLR) was established to promote the conservation 
        and rational use of marine living resources south of the Antarctic Convergence. 
        Southern Ocean fisheries are now managed within the framework of CCAMLR.</p>
      <p>Although there is uncertainty in its assessments, CCAMLR estimates that 
        the level of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in the 
        Southern Ocean - which has been a major problem for decades - had decreased 
        in 1998 but has since increased despite stronger CCAMLR measures to combat 
        IUU fishing. The high level of illegal catch of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus 
        eleginoides) in the South Indian Ocean has become a major concern as it 
        threatens the sustainability of stocks (CCAMLR 2000a). To address IUU 
        catches, CCAMLR adopted a Catch Documentation Scheme requiring all landings, 
        trans-shipments and importations of toothfish into the territories of 
        contracting parties to be accompanied by a completed catch document. In 
        2000, CCAMLR took further steps to combat IUU fishing by urging all parties 
        to avoid flagging or licensing vessels with a history of engagement in 
        illegal practices (CCAMLR 2000b).</p>
      <p>CCAMLR regulation has reduced the incidental bycatch of seabirds and 
        marine mammals in legal fisheries to low levels but illegal fishing still 
        takes its toll. For some seabird populations, long-line fisheries represent 
        a major threat. This led to the listing in 1997 of all albatross species 
        on the protected species list of the CMS. Albatross and petrel species, 
        such as the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) and the Antarctic giant 
        petrel (Macronectes giganteus), have also been listed as vulnerable in 
        the IUCN Red List (Hilton-Taylor 2000). The final draft of the Agreement 
        on the Conservation of Albatross and Petrels was recently completed in 
        Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
      <p>Changes to the distribution and composition of terrestrial flora and 
        fauna, attributable to recent warming over Antarctica, have been observed 
        over the past three decades. Composition and distribution of marine species 
        is also expected to change with a changing climate. It has been indicated 
        that the marked increase in the number of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis 
        adeliae) in the Ross Sea area in the 1980s showed remarkable synchronization 
        with the climatic variation in the same region (Taylor and Wilson 1990, 
        Blackburn and others 1990). At Palmer Station on Anvers Island, where 
        Adelie penguins are known to have nested only prior to the 1950s, gentoo 
        and chinstrap penguins are now breeding and have expanded their ranges 
        southward in the Peninsula within the past 50 years, in correlation with 
        pronounced regional warming (Emslie and others 1998).</p>
      <p>Changes in the extent and thickness of ice affect the timing, magnitude 
        and duration of the seasonal pulse of primary production in the polar 
        regions. It has been suggested that sea ice extent affects krill availability 
        which in turn may affect krill predators. Regional warming and reduced 
        krill abundance may therefore affect the marine food web (Loeb and others 
        1997). The density and abundance of minke whales has been observed to 
        be lower in seasons with warmer sea surface temperatures, fewer cold-water 
        intrusions, and smaller sea ice extent, possibly owing to the shift in 
        availability of prey (Kasamatsu 2000).</p>
      <p>Along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, springtime ozone depletion 
        can lead to a twofold increase in biologically effective UV-B radiation 
        (Day and others 1999). UV exposure affects phytoplankton, including inhibition 
        of primary production. This is a major concern in view of the phytoplankton's 
        key role in the short food chain of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The 
        spring bloom of phytoplankton coincides with the springtime ozone hole 
        and the subsequent period of high UV-B radiation. Reduction of phytoplanktonic 
        production associated with the ozone hole is estimated to be 6-12 per 
        cent (Smith and others 1992).</p>
