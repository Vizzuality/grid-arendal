      <p>Earlier chapters of <i>GEO-3</i> have outlined important and very specific 
        changes that emerged over the past 30 years, and there is no reason to 
        believe that the next 30 will be any less dynamic. Using scenarios, it 
        is possible to tell strongly contrasting but plausible stories about how 
        the world and its regions might develop in the future. None of the stories 
        requires exotic surprises to materialize and elements of each of the four 
        scenarios can already be discerned in today's world. In appreciating the 
        scenarios, it is important to realize that, in real life, they are not 
        mutually exclusive. A given region may experience all four or a combination 
        of several at once. And although the scenarios have been presented as 
        fairly uniform across the world, it is clear that not all regions have 
        experienced, are experiencing, or will experience the same developments.</p>
      <p>Examining the environmental implications casts a spotlight on the differences 
        across scenarios, regions and issues. These variations have been illustrated 
        in the narratives, the quantitative material and the differing outcomes 
        of particular events or trends.</p>

      <p><i>Sustainability First </i>implies the most positive environmental outlook 
        of the four scenarios. <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security First </i>conjure 
        up much more pessimistic pictures, but for very different reasons. This 
        contrast is reflected in the issues that come most conspicuously to the 
        fore in each scenario. For example, water shortages are generally more 
        of a problem in <i>Markets First</i>, reflecting increasing resource demand, 
        whereas urban pollution and loss of biodiversity are more marked in <i>Security 
        First</i>, reflecting a lack of effective environmental policies. <i>Policy 
        First </i>falls somewhere in between - some of the environmental targets 
        are met, through a mainly top-down approach, whereas it is unrealistic 
        to make significant progress on others without a broader commitment to 
        change.</p>
      <p>Social and economic systems can be notoriously slow to change. The basic 
        infrastructure of modern society, including transportation and energy 
        systems, cannot be refashioned rapidly without great expense. Financial 
        and political systems, and basic behaviour patterns also tend to exhibit 
        overpowering inertia. Furthermore, even when social systems change, resulting 
        in reduced pressures on the environment, time lags in natural systems 
        can delay the ultimate response to these changes. Therefore, it is important 
        to consider not only the state of the environment at the end of the time 
        horizon for these scenarios, but also the trends.</p>

      </table>
      <p>This proviso is perhaps most clearly seen in the case of climate change 
        impacts, which differ minimally between the scenarios in most regions 
        over the next 30 years. This is because much of the climatic change expected 
        to occur over the next 30 years is the result of actions that have already 
        been taken. It is not surprising that the issues which stand out as the 
        most difficult to tackle - halting land degradation, preserving biodiversity 
        and ensuring access to freshwater - are all linked to climate change among 
        other factors. The intractable nature of these impacts is also related 
        to the fact that they are driven by fundamental human demands and are 
        not easily amenable to technical fixes.</p>
      <p>The environmental implications of the various scenarios illustrate the 
        legacy of the past decades and the level of effort that will be needed 
        to reverse powerful trends. These challenges can only be met with robust 
        and coordinated action at all levels of government and among many different 
        sectors of society. The scenarios also demonstrate that it can take many 
        years for important social and environmental indicators to diverge from 
        one another. Given the likelihood that large numbers of people will continue 
        to be vulnerable to environmental change, even where the scenarios point 
        to eventual achievement of environmental goals, adaptation policies will 
        be needed to complement mitigation policies. Among other reasons, these 
        may be necessary to meet social goals, minimize the transient effects 
        of environmental change, prevent irreversible losses, and maintain the 
        enthusiasm for the necessary social and political will to achieve the 
        long-term goals.</p>

      <p>The scenarios presented here demonstrate the importance of interlinkages 
        between the environmental, social, economic and political spheres, both 
        within and across regions. The complex interplay between human and natural 
        systems calls for approaches that treat social, economic and environmental 
        concerns in an integrated fashion.</p>
      <p>Positive synergies between policies can be maximized. For example, well-designed 
        policies can simultaneously address issues such as climate change, transport, 
        and urban and regional air pollution. Thus, ambitious climate policies 
        could serve as a cornerstone of modern, integrated environmental programmes 
        in many situations.</p>
      <p>In other cases, connections imply potential conflicts. The large-scale 
        introduction of modern biofuels in certain regions as a substitute for 
        fossil fuels, a feature of the <i>Policy First </i>scenario, could have 
        adverse implications for biodiversity and agriculture in these areas. 
        Similarly, the use of biotechnology and genetic engineering to improve 
        agricultural productivity could, rather than reducing the demand for agricultural 
        land, lead to a dramatic expansion if organisms are genetically modified 
        to be able to thrive in areas currently unsuitable for widespread crop 
        production or grazing. This outcome would have serious implications for 
        biodiversity and land management.</p>

            <p>For this Global Environment Outlook a scenario approach has been 
              chosen that deliberately emphasizes the possibility of many different 
              futures rather than the probability of any single one. None of the 
              four scenarios that has been presented should be viewed as more 
              or less likely than the others, or as a reference scenario from 
              which the others represent variants. Recent experience and reflections 
              upon issues such as insufficient information (ignorance), the complexity 
              of human and natural systems (surprise), and the ability of humans 
              to choose (volition), suggests that for longer range policy thinking 
              it is not only disingenuous to presume we can know the most likely 
              future, but that it is also detrimental to good policy making because 
              it unnecessarily narrows our vision (Raskin and Kemp-Benedict 2002).</p>
            <p>The process also revealed some of the challenges in such a scenario 
              exercise. The choice to begin with global archetypes aided in the 
              effort to create sets of nested global and regional scenarios that 
              were consistent with each other. At the same time, this choice arguably 
              limited the range of scenarios that might have arisen had the regional 
              scenario teams been able to operate more independently. The efforts 
              to combine narrative scenarios with quantitative information coming 
              out of models and other analytical tools also drew attention to 
              the need to use consistent assumptions in the two approaches. The 
              quantitative underpinning certainly helped to stimulate the development 
              of the narrative scenarios and provided both consistency checks 
              and powerful means of depicting the differences between the four 
              scenarios in the different regions. It remains apparent, though, 
              that the existing quantitative tools are limited in their ability 
              to capture the richness of narrative scenarios, particularly where 
              these involve significant departures from the current situation.</p>

      <p>There is a need to be aware of both the small and the large-scale effects 
        of policies, particularly those related to the introduction of new technologies. 
        On a small scale, stimulating better technology to deliver the same services 
        with less resource use is clearly a robust policy that makes sense in 
        almost any conceivable scenario. If scaled up, however, two possible drawbacks 
        arise. First, the improved efficiency may induce an increased level of 
        activity (such as additional travelling in improved motor vehicles), which 
        outweighs the gains achieved by better technology (in this instance lower 
        fuel consumption or lower pollution emissions per kilometre travelled). 
        Second, new technologies that increase dependence, either on other countries 
        or on the technology itself, can increase vulnerability of regions to 
        disruptions in, or misuse of, these technologies.</p>

      <p>A fundamental distinction between the four scenarios lies in the existence 
        and effectiveness of strong institutions for environmental governance. 
        The scenarios represent largely different political attitudes, citizen 
        values and degrees of acceptance of (or action against) inequality. The 
        political will and vision of governments and other authorities determine, 
        above all else, whether environmentally sustainable development comes 
        within reach worldwide. Where strong institutions for environmental governance 
        are absent, as in <i>Security First</i>, or afforded a lower status than 
        other institutions, as in <i>Markets First</i>, improvements in environmental 
        conditions are less likely to occur. As the range of concerns traverses 
        the local to the global, so must these institutions. Furthermore, as all 
        sectors of society are, in some way, both responsible for and impacted 
        by the status of natural and human systems, these institutions must reach 
        across these sectors. Thus, not only formal governments, but also business, 
        NGOs and other elements of civil society must play a role, individually 
        and in partnership, in establishing and maintaining these institutions.</p>

      <p>Ensuring and stimulating timely access to information is crucial not 
        only for keeping abreast of the current state of environmental and social 
        systems and trends in both, but also for coordinating action to address 
        emerging or existing problems. Efforts are required to ensure that key 
        public information remains accessible, and that more flows are established. 
        A fundamental message, from <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>in particular, is that information can both encourage voluntary 
        action and increase the effectiveness of other policies. The flow of accurate 
        information can therefore actively support other policies. Conversely, 
        as <i>Security First </i>most notably shows, when economic and political 
        relations polarize, the control of information can be an important instrument 
        of power.</p>

      <p>It is clear that there are particular policy instruments that are more 
        in accordance with different types of worlds. For example, market-based 
        instruments such as capping and trading systems for curbing pollutants 
        will find a niche in a world that resembles <i>Markets First</i>, whereas 
        ambitious zoning and other spatial planning measures would not go down 
        so well. Similarly, ecolabelling will be suited to a world that resembles 
        <i>Sustainability First</i>, but forcibly restricting access to protected 
        areas would be much less suitable. This same argument implies that the 
        most appropriate choice of policy instruments can vary between different 
        regions or at different times. Careful selection of specific and appropriate 
        policy instruments is clearly very important.</p>
      <p>The final lesson from the scenarios presented in this chapter may be 
        one of perspective. The four scenarios show that the future is not something 
        that we should wait for passively. Rather, the choices we have made in 
        the past, those we are currently making and those we will make in the 
        future all strongly influence in which world we will live. There will 
        be many branch points when stakeholders will have the opportunity to turn 
        in one direction or another, whether towards <i>Markets First </i>or towards 
        <i>Policy First</i>, <i>Security First</i>, <i>Sustainability First </i>or 
        another, as yet unimagined, scenario. Being aware of threats, opportunities 
        and the possible outcomes of different choices is a prerequisite to effective 
        policy making.</p>
