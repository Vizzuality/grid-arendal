      <p class="global">Vulnerability assessment measures the seriousness of potential 
        threats on the basis of known hazards and the level of vulnerability of 
        societies and individuals. It can be used to translate early warning information 
        into preventive action (IDNDR 1999) and is a necessary element in early 
        warning and emergency preparedness. Ideally, the results should be incorporated 
        directly into the long-term planning of institutions and governments, 
        and should foster institutional responsiveness to increasing vulnerability, 
        and action for disaster preparedness and mitigation. Vulnerability assessments 
        are widely applied and used in the fields of climate change and natural 
        disaster management, where they provide the basis for effective warning 
        systems.</p>
      <p>Assessments of vulnerability can be made for both people and the environmental 
        systems that provide goods and services. They should identify the location 
        of vulnerable populations, the threats to their wellbeing and the extent 
        of their vulnerability; the risks to the environmental capacity to provide 
        goods and services; and the preventive steps that can be taken to improve 
        environmental conditions and reduce the negative impacts of human action 
        on the environment. This information is then assembled into a knowledge 
        base that is accessible, scientifically reliable and easy to use, which 
        can help policy-makers and planners seeking to formulate adequate responses 
        (see box).</p>

            <p>The South Pacific Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC) is developing 
              an index of the vulnerability of the environment to both human and 
              natural hazards. SOPAC identifies three aspects of environmental 
              vulnerability: level of risks (or pressures) on the environment; 
              resilience of the environment to pressures, or intrinsic vulnerability; 
              and the level of degradation of ecosystems, or extrinsic resilience. 
              A total of 47 indicators are used: 26 indicators of risk, 7 indicators 
              of resilience and 14 indicators of environmental degradation. The 
              indicators are also classified by category; meteorological, geological, 
              biological, anthropogenic and intrinsic country characteristics. 
              Data were collected for five countries (Fiji, Samoa, Tuvalu, Vanuatu 
              and Australia) for initial testing. The environmental vulnerability 
              of small island developing states arises from an interplay of factors 
              such as remoteness, geographical dispersion, vulnerability to natural 
              disasters, ecological fragility, a high degree of economic openness 
              and small internal markets, and limited natural resources.</p>
            <p>The objective of the project is to promote the use of environmental 
              vulnerability considerations in national development planning and 
              thereby encourage sustainable development. The Environmental Vulnerability 
              Index (EVI) provides a relatively quick and inexpensive way of characterizing 
              the vulnerability of natural systems at the level of a region, state, 
              province or island.</p>
            <p>The figure below shows the scores obtained by Fiji for each of 
              the 47 indicators in the EVI. Areas of vulnerability can be easily 
              identified, information that could lead to better management and 
              possibly better vulnerability scores in the future. A score of 1 
              is the least vulnerable, 7 the most vulnerable.</p>

      <p>Calculation of coping capacity would be a valuable tool for understanding 
        how and why burdens of environmental degradation are unevenly distributed 
        around the globe, and why the potential impact of different threats may 
        be more or less catastrophic depending upon a group's ability to cope. 
        In the case of diseases such as cholera, governments of highincome countries 
        would be likely to respond to the risk of an outbreak with costly prevention 
        and early warning programmes such as a cholera-monitoring network. Yet 
        this response would not be affordable in many other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>When calculating vulnerability, geographical scale is important. A single 
        national figure may hide many significant variations. Although an assessment 
        for high-income countries would show low overall vulnerability, there 
        may be sub-populations that are highly vulnerable. For instance, one country 
        may be less vulnerable to outbreaks of vector-borne disease triggered 
        by climate change than another, because of the medical system's capacity 
        to respond, but those without medical insurance may still be particularly 
        vulnerable. Furthermore, societies that are well equipped to cope with 
        present vulnerability may lack the experience or technology to respond 
        to emerging threats.</p>
