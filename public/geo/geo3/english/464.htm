      <p>Human-caused disasters cause more human fatalities and economic losses 
        than natural disasters in Europe. Despite overall higher technological 
        and safety levels in Europe, the number of industrial accidents in the 
        European Union continues to rise (EC undated). In 1997, there were 37 
        major industrial accidents — the highest annual number since records began 
        in 1985 (EEA 1999). In contrast to accidents in fixed installations, major 
        oil spills from marine transport and offshore installation accidents have 
        shown a downward trend (ITOPF 2000) although the total number of oil spills 
        appears to be increasing (EEA 2001b).</p>

      <a name="fig283"></a>It is likely that the overall risk from nuclear accidents 
      increased in the 1970s as more plants were commissioned but declined in 
      the 1990s as older plants were taken out of service and the building of 
      new ones either slowed or was completely abandoned due to public pressure. 
      However, quantifying the risk from accidental releases of radionuclides 
      is not possible due to lack of sufficiently detailed, comparable information. 
      A widespread campaign on increasing the safety of new and already functioning 
      civil nuclear reactors, especially in CEE countries, was catalysed by the 
      1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union. Significant 
      resources have been allocated to increasing nuclear safety at nuclear processing 
      plants (for example, €838 million was spent by the European Commission between 
      1991 and 1998 (EC 2001)). However, a complicating factor is the increasing 
      deterioration of the older nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation 
      and Lithuania built to a similar design to the Chernobyl reactor. 
      <p>Analyses of major industrial accidents indicate that component failure 
        and operator error are the two most common immediate causes but the dominant 
        underlying causes identified were poor safety and environmental management 
        (Drogaris 1993, Rasmussen 1996). The age of process plants is a further 
        factor as the probability of ‘wear-out’ failure increases with age (M&M 
        Protection Consultants 1997). Lack of expenditure on safety and environmental 
        management, and operating plants past their design life, are often a result 
        of pressure from shareholders wishing to increase profitability, although 
        this may result in major losses in the long run. However, they also reveal 
        gaps in regulation and monitoring. The mining accident at Baia Mare, Romania, 
        in January 2000 served as a rather sobering reminder of the shortcomings 
        in enforcement of environmental regulations in the countries of Eastern 
        Europe (see box). </p>

            <p>At 22:00 on 30 January 2000, a dam wall failed at a mine tailings 
              reclamation facility at Baia Mare in northwestern Romania, spilling 
              100 000 m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater polluted with cyanide into the 
              Tisa river and then the Danube, eventually entering the Black Sea, 
              by which time it had become significantly diluted. The spill devastated 
              large numbers of plant and wildlife species in the river systems.</p>
            <p>The Baia Mare Task Force, set up to investigate, reported that 
              faults in the design of the operating plant, including inadequate 
              construction of the dams, contributed to the accident. The key problem 
              was believed to be the ineffectiveness of the permitting and enforcement 
              authorities. The permitting process was over-complex and the Task 
              Force concluded that the original environmental impact assessment 
              was flawed. Furthermore, no measures were established to deal with 
              an emergency, and monitoring of the water level in the tailings 
              pond where the dam broke was inadequate.</p>
