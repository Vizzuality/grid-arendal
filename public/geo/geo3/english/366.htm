      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) lists six 'classic' air pollutants: 
        CO, lead, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), suspended particulate matter 
        (SPM) - including dust, fumes, mists and smoke - SO<sub>2</sub> and tropospheric 
        ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) (WHO 1999).</p>
      <p>The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is the most significant source 
        of air pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, certain nitrous oxides such 
        as NO and NO<sub>2</sub> (known collectively as NO<sub>x</sub>), SPM, 
        volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and some heavy metals. It is also the 
        major anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), one of 
        the important greenhouse gases. Between 1973 and 1998, total energy supply 
        increased by 57 per cent (see graph opposite), the majority provided by 
        oil, natural gas and coal with nuclear and hydropower and other renewable 
        resources playing a minor role (IEA 2000). The fuels used vary from region 
        to region - for example, natural gas dominates in the Russian Federation, 
        while coal provides 73 per cent of the energy consumed in China (BP Amoco 
        2000). Biomass is an important source of energy in the developing world 
        and is the main source of indoor air pollution in such countries (Holdren 
        and Smith 2000).</p>
      <p>Acid precipitation has been one of the most important environmental concerns 
        over the past decades especially in Europe and North America (Rodhe and 
        others 1995), and more recently also in China (Seip and others 1999). 
        Significant damage to forests in Europe became a high priority environmental 
        issue around 1980, while thousands of lakes in Scandinavia lost fish populations 
        due to acidification from the 1950s to the 1980s. In some parts of Europe, 
        the anthropogenic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions which lead to acid precipitation 
        have been reduced by nearly 70 per cent from their maximum values (EEA 
        2001); there have also been reductions of some 40 per cent in the United 
        States (US EPA 2000). This has resulted in a significant recovery of the 
        natural acid balance, at least in Europe. On the contrary, as a result 
        of the growing use of coal and other high sulphur fuels, increasing SO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions in the Asia and Pacific Region are a serious environmental threat 
        (UNEP 1999).</p>
      <p>Air pollutant emissions have declined or stabilized in most industrialized 
        countries, largely as a result of abatement policies developed and implemented 
        since the 1970s. Initially governments tried to apply direct control instruments 
        but these were not always costeffective. In the 1980s, policies were directed 
        more towards cost-effective pollution abatement mechanisms that relied 
        on a compromise between the cost of environmental protection measures 
        and economic growth. The Polluter Pays Principle has become a basic concept 
        in environmental policy planning.</p>
      <p>Recent policy developments, at both national and regional levels, are 
        based on economic and regulatory instruments, and technology improvement 
        and transfer to enhance emission reductions. In the international arena, 
        one of the most important political developments has been the Convention 
        on Long- Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), adopted in 1979. 
        Through a series of protocols establishing reduction objectives for the 
        main air pollutants, this treaty has catalysed European, Canadian and 
        US governments to implement national emission abatement policies (ECE 
        1995). The most recent protocol is the 1999 Protocol to Abate Acidification, 
        Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone that sets up new reduction commitments 
        for SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, VOCs and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) 
        (ECE 2000).</p>

            <p>Harmful substances emitted to the air affect both human health 
              and ecosystems. Indoor and outdoor air pollution are estimated to 
              be responsible for nearly 5 per cent of the global burden of disease. 
              Air pollution aggravates and, possibly, even causes asthma and other 
              allergic respiratory diseases. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, such 
              as stillbirth and low birth weight, have also been associated with 
              air pollution (Holdren and Smith 2000). It has been estimated that 
              in developing countries about 1.9 million people die annually due 
              to exposure to high concentrations of SPM in the indoor air environment 
              of rural areas, while the excess mortality due to outdoor levels 
              of SPM and SO<sub>2</sub> amounts to about 500 000 people annually. 
              Evidence is also emerging that particles with median aerodynamic 
              diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) affect human health 
              significantly (WHO 1999).</p>
            <p>Acid deposition is one of the causes of acidification of soil and 
              water that results in declining fish stocks, decreasing diversity 
              in acid-sensitive lakes and degradation of forest and soil. Excessive 
              nitrogen (as nitrate and/or ammonium) promotes eutrophication, particularly 
              in coastal areas. Acid rain damages ecosystems, provokes defoliation, 
              corrosion of monuments and historic buildings and reduces agricultural 
              yields.</p>

      <p><a name="fig211"></a>Stricter environmental regulation in the industrialized 
        countries has triggered the introduction of cleaner technology and technological 
        improvements, especially in the power generation and transport sectors. 
        In the latter, a significant reduction in harmful emissions has been achieved 
        due to the improved engine combustion cycle, increased fuel efficiency 
        and the widespread introduction of catalytic converters (Holdren and Smith 
        2000). Lead emissions from gasoline additives have now declined to zero 
        in many industrial countries (EEA 1999, US EPA 2000). In developing countries, 
        however, the sources of emissions are more varied and include highly polluting 
        power plants, heavy industry, vehicles and the domestic combustion of 
        coal, charcoal and biomass. While the emission of pollutants can be significantly 
        reduced for a small cost, few developing nations have made even small 
        investments in pollution reduction measures, even though the environmental 
        and population health benefits of such measures are evident (Holdren and 
        Smith 2000, World Bank 1997).</p>
      <p>Though measurable progress in industrial emission abatement has been 
        achieved at least by the developed countries, transport has become one 
        of the major sources of air pollution (particularly NO<sub>x</sub> and 
        many carbon compounds) in many countries. High concentrations of these 
        compounds in urban air can, under certain climatic conditions, result 
        in photochemical smog that severely affects human health. In many urban 
        centres and their surrounding areas, high concentrations of tropospheric 
        O<sub>3</sub> are an additional problem. Anthropogenic tropospheric ozone 
        may be produced by reactions between NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs on warm sunny 
        days, especially in urban and industrial areas and in regions prone to 
        stagnant air masses. This can have far-reaching implications since molecules 
        of O<sub>3</sub> have been found to travel large distances (up to 800 
        km) from emission sources (CEC 1997). Tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentrations 
        over large areas of Europe and some areas of North America are so high 
        that not only is human health threatened but vegetation is also affected. 
        For example, in the United States ground-level ozone has been estimated 
        to cost more than US$500 million a year as a result of reductions in agricultural 
        and commercial forest yields (US EPA 2000).</p>

      <p><a name="fig212"></a>Urban air pollution is one of the most important 
        environmental problems. In most European and North American cities, the 
        concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> and SPM have decreased substantially 
        in recent years (Fenger 1999, US EPA 2000). However, in many developing 
        countries, rapid urbanization has resulted in increasing air pollution 
        in many cities (Fenger 1999), WHO air quality guidelines are often not 
        met and, in megacities such as Beijing, Calcutta, Mexico City and Rio 
        de Janeiro, high levels of SPM prevail (World Bank 2001).</p>
      <p>A final issue of global concern is that of persistent organic pollutants 
        (POPs). These substances are known to decay slowly and they can be transported 
        over long distances through the atmosphere (see illustration). High concentrations 
        of some POPs are found in polar areas (Schindler 1999, Masclet and others 
        2000, Espeland and others 1997) with potentially serious regional environmental 
        impacts. These compounds can also accumulate in animal fats, representing 
        a health risk. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 
        adopted in May 2001, sets out control measures covering handling of pesticides, 
        industrial chemicals and unintended byproducts. The control provisions 
        call for eliminating the production and use of intentionally produced 
        POPs, and eliminating unintentionally produced POPs where feasible (UNEP 
        2001).</p>
