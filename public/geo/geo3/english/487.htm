      <p>The policies articulated in documents such as the Stockholm <i>Declaration 
        and Programme of Action</i>, the <i>World Conservation Strategy, Our Common 
        Future</i>, the <i>Rio Declaration </i>and <i>Agenda 21</i>, have driven 
        the environmental agenda in the period 1972-2002. Binding legal regimes 
        - some from before 1972 - now form the body of international environmental 
        law, providing the appropriate muscle necessary to encourage compliance. 
        Along with the policies and legal framework, the past three decades have 
        also seen a proliferation of environmental institutions across public 
        and private sectors, and civil society in general. Ministries or departments 
        of environment are now common in all regions. Sustainable development 
        and environmental standards have become part of the <i>lingua franca</i> 
        of major corporations, with many now making annual environmental reporting 
        part of the corporate agenda. Civil society has come of age, recording 
        many successes at different levels - from community to the international 
        level. Some of the successes that have been achieved since 1972 include 
        the following:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>Addressing stratospheric ozone depletion is notable victory for global 
          environmental governance. However, it needs continuing vigilance.</li>
        <li>Concern over levels of common air pollutants has resulted in encouraging 
          reductions in many countries, achieved through specific policy measures, 
          including emissions and air quality standards, as well as technology-based 
          regulations and different market-based instruments.</li>
        <li>More holistic approaches to land management, such as integrated plant 
          nutrition systems and integrated pest management, have been introduced 
          with positive results for the health of agricultural ecosystems in some 
          regions.</li>
        <li>Freshwater policies have begun to move away from a riparian rights 
          focus and towards exploring efficiency improvements and river basin 
          management. Integrated water resources management is now widely accepted 
          as a strategic policy initiative.</li>
        <li>A new theoretical understanding of the benefits of ecosystem services 
          has emerged but, in practice, information and policy instruments to 
          protect these have been lacking or sporadic.</li>
        <li>There has been a recent evolution from 'end-of-pipe' approaches to 
          goals for sustainability and a modest shift to a more integrated approach 
          to environmental policies and management, focusing on the sustainability 
          of ecosystems and watersheds, for example, rather than on sustaining 
          yields.</li>
        <li>It is now recognized that poverty reduction, economic development 
          and environmental stability should be mutual goals. This breaks with 
          the old thinking prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s which regarded environmental 
          protection and economic development as conflicting aims.</li>
        <li>Prosperity and an informed and active civil society have been key 
          drivers of policies to address various environmental problems that became 
          apparent early in the 30-year period in developed nations. Ambient air 
          quality and point-source water pollution have been addressed satisfactorily 
          in many areas; recycling has become more common; wastewater treatment 
          has improved; pulp-and-paper industry effluents have declined and hazardous 
          waste threats have been reduced. Protected areas have been increasingly 
          set aside for conservation and recreation.</li>
        <li>Successes in the developing world have been mixed: there has been 
          a growing democratization and participation process positively underpinning 
          environment-development in some regions, with a growing civil society 
          awareness of the debate.</li>
        <li>A natural 'cluster' of biodiversity policies is emerging, of which 
          the CBD is the core regime, but which also includes a host of other 
          treaties and initiatives such as CITES, CMS and the Ramsar Convention.</li>
        <li>Technological change has helped to relieve some environmental pressures: 
          lower material intensity in production; a shift from materials and energy 
          supply to the provision of services; a modest boost in renewable technology; 
          and a significant clean-up in some regions in previously 'dirty' industries.</li>
        <li>In recent years, risk reduction has been placed higher on political 
          agendas, and response mechanisms and early warning systems have been 
          strengthened.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An overall observation is that many of the policies mentioned in this 
        chapter have either no clearly defined and specific performance criteria 
        or the criteria are not readily related to environmental performance. 
        This is true of, for example, economic policies related to taxation, trade 
        and investment. Although some of them have significant links to environmental 
        issues (in some cases, they are key drivers of environmental change), 
        their built-in evaluation criteria are usually limited to economic performance. 
        This has made their evaluation particularly challenging from an environmental 
        and sustainable development perspective.</p>
