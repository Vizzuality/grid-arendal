      <p>Alarmed by migration, terrorism and disease, members of the affluent 
        minority fear that they too will be engulfed. Even some of the more prosperous 
        nations feel the sting as infrastructure decays, technology fails and 
        institutions collapse. As OECD economies falter and their populations 
        age, social programmes introduced in the 20th century but neglected year 
        after year, begin to unravel.</p>
      <p>These and other factors lead to a dramatic swing in approaches to governance. 
        Having stood by, sometimes willingly, and seen their powers eroded, governments 
        strive to reassert their authority. To stem the collapse, the forces of 
        order react with sufficient cohesion and force to impose an authoritarian 
        order throughout much of the world. In many regions these shifts appear 
        merely as a continuation of normal practice or a return to the notso- 
        distant past. In others, though, sacrificing long cherished ideals (such 
        as democracy, transparency and participation in governance) for greater 
        security is no easy trade-off. A growing sense of lifeboat ethics - an 
        acceptance that only by letting some drown can the others remain afloat 
        - allows the governments and citizens of these countries to make certain 
        consensual choices. Other decisions are eventually made without popular 
        consent and are accepted without question.</p>
      <p>This process takes time to develop, but a pattern gradually emerges. 
        In rich nations, the wealthiest people flourish in protected enclaves 
        and the general public receives some assurance from the increased level 
        of security. Strongholds also persist in the poorer nations, protecting 
        the remaining elites and strategic resources. In some regions, control 
        is unstable; the power base shifts as one faction or ethnic group overpowers 
        another.</p>
      <p>The strongholds are 'islands of prosperity in an ocean of poverty and 
        despair' (Hammond 1998), descendants of the walled cities of earlier eras 
        and the gated communities of more recent times. Sometimes the walls are 
        physical; at other times they are more metaphorical. Nevertheless, these 
        bubbles of wealth are not isolated. They are connected in a global network 
        with shared economic, environmental and security interests. Through this 
        network, globalization continues, albeit in a distorted form.</p>
      <p>Within the walls, life proceeds with some semblance of order. Technological 
        advances continue to be made. Health and educational services continue 
        to be provided, consumption patterns do not shift dramatically and environmental 
        conditions hold steady. Businesses assist in the provision of some socially 
        important programmes, especially those directly related to their interests, 
        for example, education to address skill shortages and provision of basic 
        needs to workers. Still, there is always a recognition that security is 
        of paramount importance. It is pursued by various authoritarian policies 
        and institutions, whose methods include surveillance and the profiling 
        and harassment of particular dissident groups.</p>
      <p>Outside the walls, the majority is trapped in poverty. The provision 
        of basic needs - water, health services, sanitation, food, shelter and 
        energy - is piecemeal or often non-existent. Many people are denied basic 
        freedoms. By comparison with the cohesive societies within the walls, 
        this world is increasingly chaotic and disconnected. Technological progress 
        continues to be made in these communities, at times by theft or leakage 
        from within the walls, but also by indigenous enterprises. Such breakthroughs 
        tend to be small-scale, however, and the lack of harmonization and capacity 
        building prevents dramatic advances that might prompt large improvements. 
        The inability to achieve economies of scale further hinders progress and 
        growth.</p>
      <p>The interplay between life inside and outside the enclaves goes well 
        beyond merely policing the borders between the two. The bubbles of prosperity 
        depend heavily on a constant flow of resources from areas not fully under 
        their control. Where the elite are able to exert control, there is strict 
        management of source areas for products of commercial value and those 
        that serve a more basic life support function. These wellprotected areas, 
        both on land and in the oceans, provide a haven for many other species, 
        but do little to improve the lot of people who are excluded. Where areas 
        are simply mined and abandoned, those on the outside are expected to deal 
        with the aftermath.</p>
      <p>The elite also rely upon the broader world to absorb the excesses of 
        their lifestyles. Wastes produced within the strongholds are transported 
        into outlying areas. The pressures that such wastes place on unprotected 
        natural systems add to the problems of people struggling to survive. These 
        problems include overuse and fouling of water sources above and below 
        ground, the effects of uncontrolled use of dirty fossil fuels, contamination 
        from untreated solid wastes, continued deforestation to provide fuelwood 
        and the degradation of marginal areas used for agriculture.</p>

      </table>
      <p>Trade also crosses the boundaries between the two worlds. Those inside 
        the walls have not lost their taste for products that must come from outside, 
        including illegal drugs and those derived from rare species. Both money 
        and military supplies find their way outside in return, where they trigger 
        not just external chaos and lawlessness but also periodic terrorist attacks 
        against the fortresses.</p>
      <p>In this atmosphere, both the informal and legitimate small enterprises 
        flourish by serving local needs. Charities and other welfare providers 
        in civil society try to assist where governments and businesses fall short 
        in the provision of basic needs, which happens in many cases, but the 
        task proves far from simple and their efforts far from effective.</p>
