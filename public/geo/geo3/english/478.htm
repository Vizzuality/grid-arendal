      <a name="fig291"></a>Rainfall appears to be declining in some countries 
      bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Over the past 100 years, precipitation 
      has decreased by more than 5 per cent over much of the land bordering the 
      Mediterranean with a few exceptions such as Libya and Tunisia (IPCC 1996). 
      The region suffered droughts during the 1930s, 1960s and the 1990s. In the 
      winters of 1991-92 and 1992-93, snowfall was rare in many areas of the eastern 
      Mediterranean (WMO and UNEP 1994). Cycles of drought have become intense 
      and more frequent. The 1998-99 drought affected many countries and Syria 
      was the worst hit, suffering its worst drought in 25 years (FAO 1999). 
      <p>The most direct effects of the drought were crop failures and a decline 
        in cereal and livestock production. In Iraq, for example, cereal production 
        declined by 20 per cent compared to the previous year and by 40 per cent 
        compared to the average production for the previous five years (FAO 1999). 
        A report by a FAO/WFP mission to Syria stated that a large proportion 
        of the nomadic herders were facing 'financial ruin', with 4 700 households 
        seriously vulnerable to food shortages and in urgent need of food assistance. 
        Cereal production was also seriously affected. Barley harvest was estimated 
        to be only 380 000 tonnes - less than half the 1998 total and down 72 
        per cent from the previous five-year average. Local needs had to be satisfied 
        through imports. Reduction in wheat production was less severe (28 per 
        cent below average) because 40 per cent of Syria's wheat fields are irrigated. 
        Jordan was also adversely affected by the drought, which reduced the country's 
        wheat and barley production in 1999 by 88 per cent (WFP 2001).</p>

      <a name="fig292"></a>Drought results in economic, social and environmental 
      problems. Economic hardships during drought intensify and can lead to social 
      conflict between land users, especially in the Mashriq countries and in 
      Yemen where an agricultural economy prevails. Drought is also a major limiting 
      factor to the region's economic development, affecting the development of 
      agricultural and water schemes, and ultimately food production. 
      <p>Forage and fodder become scarce in rangelands during droughts. In addition, 
        the decline in cereal production and the limited availability of crop 
        residues worsen the impact of drought on the sheep population and consequently 
        on human well-being. Loss of sheep and the high price of supplementary 
        feed led to a significant drop in farmers' incomes and many families were 
        forced to sell off their animals and other assets at low prices (FAO 1999).</p>
      <p>Land degradation, mostly in the form of desertification, is one of the 
        region's most serious problems. Although desertification is often attributed 
        to poor land use practices, drought deepens the effect and extends the 
        area prone to desertification to encompass areas normally not at risk. 
        Decreases in plant cover due to drought may also increase erosion and 
        lead to a nearly irreversible loss of productive potential and subsequently 
        desertification (Le Houérou 1993, Parton and others 1993).</p>
      <p>Nations have responded to drought by improving national efforts to combat 
        desertification and joining international ones with the same aim such 
        as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Under the 
        auspices of this international treaty, national action programmes have 
        been developed and a subregional action programme to combat desertification 
        and drought was adopted in 2000 (UNCCD 2001).</p>
      <p>At the national level, actions and measures include modification of agricultural 
        and water policies and giving priority to drought-affected areas.</p>
