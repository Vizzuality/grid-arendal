      <p>While systems of governance and longer term planning remain poorly developed, 
        the regional shifts described above modify relationships between regions 
        and the concerted management of common resources. These resources are 
        increasingly incorporated into the global economic system but authorities 
        in charge of their management persist in putting economic potential first. 
        In polar regions multinationals negotiate agreements, either with nations 
        or, in the case of the Arctic, directly with indigenous populations. More 
        areas and more resources (such as freshwater) are laid open to commercial 
        exploitation.</p>
      <p>Developments in international security look still less promising. The 
        United States falls back on a more unilateralist stance, involving only 
        a limited number of partners. This encourages other nations and regions 
        to continue development of their military forces. Thus opportunities for 
        broad-based international cooperation are not pursued. Acts of terrorism 
        are followed by periods of retaliation involving short-lived coalitions. 
        This keeps the level of the problem fairly low in the short term, but 
        does little to address the root causes of discontent in the long term.</p>
      <p>Influenced by large national and multinational corporations based inside 
        their borders, many countries adopt a fairly narrow approach to global 
        negotiations, in which the paramount concern is the protection of their 
        respective national interests rather than shared or common resources. 
        Efforts to ratify a treaty to address climate issues drag on without fruition 
        and are set aside part way through the first decade. There is more success 
        in other arenas, such as dealing with selected persistent organic pollutants, 
        but even here the scope of the agreements is limited and difficulties 
        with enforcement mechanisms lead to disappointing results.</p>
      <p>Actions continue to address social and environmental issues, but are 
        mainly taken at local level. Europe drafts regional conventions which 
        deal primarily with transboundary pollutants and the burdensome environmental 
        legacy of the former Soviet Bloc. Similar efforts arise in other regions, 
        though not always resulting in formal conventions and even then many of 
        the signed conventions are not effectively implemented. There are attempts 
        to crosslink these instruments to trade and other economic agreements. 
        When conflicts arise, however, it is the economic imperative that usually 
        takes precedence. Most notably, the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects 
        of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the WTO tends to override competing 
        pacts reflected in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and other 
        multilateral environmental agreements. In Europe, the policy change that 
        arguably has the greatest impact on the environment, the reform of the 
        Common Agricultural Policy at the end of the first decade of the century, 
        is pursued for primarily economic reasons.</p>

      <p>The United Nations, other international bodies, NGOs and some businesses 
        persist in their efforts to make advances on the goals set out in Agenda 
        21, at the WSSD and in other high-profile arenas. Nevertheless, without 
        full commitment from its member nations and without fundamental reform, 
        the United Nations continues to struggle to play the role many expect 
        of it. It makes slow progress in international coordination on environmental 
        and social issues. It scores moderate successes in peacekeeping and disaster 
        relief efforts, which are called on more and more frequently as the years 
        pass. However, the organization finds itself operating in a primarily 
        reactive, as distinct from a proactive, mode. NGOs also find their efforts 
        hindered by more powerful forces, including the steady ascendancy of individualistic 
        over altruistic values in civil society and public life. When NGOs urge 
        others to work for the common good, their appeals tend to be met with 
        complacent apathy. NGOs that prosper tend to be those that adopt a more 
        market-oriented approach or form partnerships directly with businesses, 
        industry or both.</p>
      <p>Overall, most advances in social and environmental arenas are by-products 
        of efforts to improve economic development.</p>
