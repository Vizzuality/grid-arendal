      <p>In all scenarios except <i>Security First</i>, some forms of land use 
        planning and effective arable land protection policies are implemented 
        to prevent actual degradation of the extremely scarce cultivable land 
        in the region. As a result, the rate of land degradation and loss slows 
        down and gradually stabilizes. In a <i>Markets First</i> scenario, the 
        available cropland is managed more carefully than in the past, in the 
        interest of protecting agricultural markets. However, population and economic 
        growth more than counteract these efforts (see <a href="574.htm#fig384a">chart</a>). 
        Land conservation in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>leads 
        to much slower cropland degradation. In addition, some degraded land is 
        restored, leading to substantially lower net rates than in <i>Markets 
        First </i>or <i>Security First</i>. In <i>Sustainability First </i>reductions 
        in population growth and well-researched advances in biotechnology and 
        genetic engineering further offset these pressures. </p>
      <p>Water stress in West Asia continues to increase as water demands exceed 
        available water resources, owing to population growth and expansion of 
        different development sectors (see charts). In <i>Markets First </i>and 
        <i>Security First</i>, deteriorating water quality and increasing competition 
        between sectors, users or both, hampers food production and leads to conflicts 
        (mainly between the domestic and agricultural sectors), increasing water-related 
        health problems. Water withdrawals are slightly higher in <i>Security 
        First</i>, due to more water-cooled thermal electricity production. Improved 
        irrigation efficiency and minor shifts in irrigated areas (under <i>Markets 
        First </i>only) lead to decreasing water withdrawals for irrigation. In 
        total, water withdrawals increase slightly under both scenarios, leading 
        to an increase in areas with severe water stress and affecting over 200 
        million people. Demand management and conservation policies are introduced 
        gradually in <i>Markets First </i>as the degree of water scarcity rises 
        in individual countries but there is no strategic water resources planning 
        in a <i>Security First </i>world. In this scenario, water scarcity reaches 
        its highest levels in the Arabian Peninsula, in terms of the number of 
        the population affected, and groundwater resources, the principal source 
        of water in this sub-region, are depleted and deteriorate to the extent 
        that they are no longer directly usable.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Under the <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>scenarios, 
        reductions in irrigated areas in the region, combined with structural 
        changes in the way water is used in industry, lead to reductions in total 
        water withdrawals. Accordingly some river basins drop out of the severe 
        water stress category. In <i>Policy First</i>, the area under water stress 
        is stabilized by adopting strategic water resources management to increase 
        water use efficiency and resource protection. A major policy shift, from 
        'supply augmentation' towards 'demand management and conservation' occurs. 
        This shift is achieved through water pricing, awareness and education 
        campaigns, enforcement of legislation and management of marginal water, 
        as well as more efficient allocation of water resources among the competing 
        economic sectors. In <i>Sustainability First</i>, the increase of freshwater 
        made available by desalination technology, wide application of biotechnology 
        in the field of food production and decrease in population growth rate 
        in the region, help to counteract the effects of additional demand related 
        to higher economic growth. In both scenarios, however, water scarcity 
        persists and affects growing numbers of people as water demand continues 
        to exceed available water resources.</p>
      <p>The impact of water stress in the different scenarios also depends on 
        relations between individual countries in West Asia and on West Asia's 
        relations with other regions. About 60 per cent of surface water resources 
        originate from outside the region. In <i>Security First</i>, countries 
        sharing river basins fail to sign conventions and agreements on sharing 
        and management of water resources, including surface and groundwater, 
        or on monitoring their quantity and quality. In <i>Markets First</i>, 
        equitable sharing of surface water resources among such countries might 
        eventually be reached, limiting conflicts and tension. This shift also 
        helps overall development, increases agricultural production and reduces 
        uncertainty in planning. Even so, construction of dams in upstream countries 
        continues, curbing downstream flows, increasing tension in the region 
        and impacting river and marine ecosystems downstream. This situation is 
        exacerbated by cyclical droughts common to the region. In <i>Security 
        First</i>, conflicts and tension increase within the region, as well as 
        with countries outside the region, eventually leading to water wars. These 
        concerns ease in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>as 
        countries negotiate agreements on the equitable sharing of surface water 
        resources.</p>
      <p>Such steps are taken further in <i>Sustainability First</i>. A total 
        catchment management approach is widely adopted and conventions agreed 
        on sharing and managing groundwater resources to safeguard both quantity 
        and quality. There is also greater cooperation between countries on dam 
        construction, including environmental impact assessments that look at 
        potential impacts on downstream parts of the river and marine ecosystems.</p>
