      <p>Urban areas do not have only local environmental impacts but also large 
        so-called 'ecological footprints' (WWF 2000). In their immediate vicinity, 
        cities have a variety of impacts: conversion of agricultural or forest 
        land for urban uses and infrastructure, reclaiming of wetlands, quarrying 
        and excavation of sand, gravel and building materials in large quantities 
        and, in some regions, deforestation to meet fuel demand. The use of biomass 
        fuel also causes indoor and outdoor air pollution. Other effects can be 
        felt further afield such as pollution of waterways, lakes and coastal 
        waters by untreated effluent. Air pollution from cities has an impact 
        on residents' health as well as on vegetation and soils at a considerable 
        distance. Urban transport contributes to air pollution and the large concentration 
        of cars and industries in cities causes the lion's share of urban global 
        greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Cities are often located in prime agricultural areas. If this land is 
        converted for urban uses, this puts additional pressure on nearby areas 
        that may be less suitable for agriculture. Urbanization in coastal areas 
        often leads to the destruction of sensitive ecosystems and can also alter 
        the hydrology of coasts and their natural features such as mangrove swamps, 
        reefs and beaches that serve as barriers to erosion and form important 
        habitats for species.</p>
      <p>Low to medium density residential areas (urban sprawl) around urban centres 
        are common in the developed world. Well developed infrastructure and the 
        increasing use of the car have facilitated this trend. Urban sprawl has 
        an especially damaging effect on the environment associated with the increase 
        in use of private motorized transport. Furthermore, low density development 
        occupies proportionally larger areas of land per capita.</p>

            <p>An ecological footprint is the area of productive land and aquatic 
              ecosystems required to produce the resources used, and to assimilate 
              the wastes produced, by a defined population at a specified material 
              standard of living, wherever that land may be located.</p>
            <p>London Trust Co-founder Herbert Girardet has calculated that the 
              ecological footprint of London - with 12 per cent of the UK population 
              and covering just 170 000 ha - comes to some 21 million ha or 125 
              times the surface area of the city itself, equivalent to all the 
              productive land in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>William Rees - Professor of Community and Regional Planning at 
              the University of British Columbia - has made an ecological footprint 
              analysis of his home city of Vancouver, Canada. This indicates that 
              Vancouver appropriates the productive output of a land area nearly 
              174 times larger than its political area to support its lifestyle. 
              Other researchers have found that the aggregate consumption of wood, 
              paper, fibre and food by the inhabitants of 29 cities in the Baltic 
              Sea drainage basin appropriates an area 200 times larger than the 
              cities themselves.</p>
            <p>Scientists have calculated that a typical North American city with 
              a population of 650 000 people would require 30 000 km<sup>2</sup> 
              of land, an area roughly the size of Vancouver Island in Canada, 
              to meet its domestic needs without including the environmental demands 
              of industry. A similarly sized city in India would require only 
              2 900 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <p>Water is a key issue in urban areas. The intensity of demand in cities 
        can quickly exceed local supply. The price of water is typically lower 
        than the actual cost of obtaining, treating and distributing it, partly 
        because of government subsidies. As a result, households and industries 
        have little incentive to conserve water (UNEP 2000). Pollution from urban 
        run-off, sewage and untreated discharges of industries has adversely affected 
        many water bodies, leaving many cities with unsafe water supply.</p>
      <p>Although local environmental problems tend to diminish with increasing 
        income levels, other environmental problems tend to become worse (McGranahan 
        and others 2001). The most obvious are high levels of energy use and increasing 
        levels of consumption and waste production. Urban residents rely heavily 
        on fossil fuels and electricity, and wealthy cities tend to use more energy 
        and produce more waste.</p>
      <p>Inadequate waste collection and waste management systems are the cause 
        of serious urban pollution and health hazards, especially in cities in 
        developing countries. Cities in industrialized countries are now also 
        facing the consequences of past environmentally damaging production techniques 
        and inadequate waste disposal. This has resulted in many different forms 
        of pollution and in particular the formation of brownfields: abandoned, 
        vacant or underused former industrial areas where redevelopment is hampered 
        by environmental problems and lack of adequate information on contaminated 
        land management (Butler 1996). Another problem emerging in developed countries 
        is the lack of suitable landfill sites to cater for the increasing demand 
        for solid waste disposal.</p>

      <a name="fig244"></a>Worsening environmental conditions can have serious 
      effects on human health and welfare, particularly for the poor (Hardoy, 
      Mitlin and Satterthwaite 1992). Poor sanitation creates environmental and 
      health hazards particularly by direct exposure to faeces and drinking water 
      contamination. Air and water pollution cause chronic and infectious respiratory 
      disease, water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea and intestinal worm infections, 
      increased mortality rates particularly among children and premature deaths 
      - especially among the poor (OECD-DAC 2000, Listorti 1999, Satterthwaite 
      1997, McGranahan 1993, Hardoy, Cairncross and Satterthwaite 1990). However, 
      worldwide epidemiological and demographic information suggests that survival 
      rates are better in cities than in rural areas because of better access 
      to health services (UNCHS 2001b). The urban poor are particularly exposed 
      because of their location and because they have limited resources with which 
      to compensate for these problems by buying potable water, securing medical 
      care or escaping floods.
<p>There are many other less quantifiable but nonetheless important environmental 
        impacts, such as loss of green space in urban areas, destruction of special 
        local ecosystems, noise pollution, and aesthetically unpleasant sights 
        and smells. These not only constitute a genuine loss of well-being but 
        they can also erode civic pride and lower morale, leading to indifference 
        and cynicism locally and to a negative image externally.</p>
      <p>The relatively disproportionate urban environmental footprint is acceptable 
        to a certain extent because, for some issues, the per capita environmental 
        impact of cities is smaller than would be made by a similar number of 
        people in a rural setting. Cities concentrate populations in a way that 
        reduces land pressure and provides economies of scale and proximity of 
        infrastructure and services (Hardoy, Mitlin and Satterthwaite 2001). Urban 
        areas therefore hold promise for sustainable development because of their 
        ability to support a large number of people while limiting their per capita 
        impact on the natural environment (UNCHS 2001b).</p>
      <p>Environmental problems occur because of the concentration of environmentally 
        negative impacts. Good urban planning can reduce these impacts. Wellplanned, 
        densely populated settlements can reduce the need for land conversion, 
        provide opportunities for energy savings and make recycling more costeffective. 
        If cities are properly managed, with adequate attention paid to social 
        development and the environment, the problems present as a result of rapid 
        urbanization, particularly in developing regions, can be avoided. A first 
        step in this direction would be for national governments to incorporate 
        a clear urban component in their economic and other policies.</p>
      <p>Successes in urban environmental management include increases in resource 
        efficiency, reductions in waste generation, improving urban infrastructure 
        for water supply, the management and conservation of water resources in 
        urban areas by improved waste water treatment and through legislation, 
        setting up of recycling schemes, development of more effective waste collection 
        systems, strict legislation for the treatment of hazardous waste, waste 
        collection through public-private partnership, adoption of energy technologies 
        by industry and households, and restoration of brownfields.</p>
