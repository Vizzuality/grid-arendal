      <p>Vulnerability represents the interface between exposure to the physical 
        threats to human well-being and the capacity of people and communities 
        to cope with those threats. Threats may arise from a combination of social 
        and physical processes. Human vulnerability thus integrates many environmental 
        concerns. Since everyone is vulnerable to environmental threats, in some 
        way, the issue cuts across rich and poor, urban and rural, North and South, 
        and may undermine the entire sustainable development process in developing 
        countries. Reducing vulnerability requires identifying points of intervention 
        in the causal chain between the emergence of a hazard and the human consequences 
        (Clark and others 1998). </p>
      <p>Many natural phenomena pose threats, including extreme events such as 
        floods, drought, fire, storms, tsunami, landslides, volcanic eruptions, 
        earthquakes and insect swarms. Human activities have added to the list, 
        with threats from explosions, chemical and radioactive contamination, 
        and other technological incidents. The risk lies in the probability of 
        exposure to any of these events, which can occur with varying severity 
        at different geographical scales, suddenly and unexpectedly or gradually 
        and predictably, and to the degree of exposure. With an increasing and 
        more widely distributed global population, however, natural disasters 
        are resulting in increasing damage, loss of life and displacement of populations. 
        In addition, human-induced changes to the environment have reduced its 
        capacity to absorb the impacts of change and to deliver the goods and 
        services to satisfy human needs. </p>
      <p>The analysis of environmental impacts in <a href="081.htm">Chapter 2</a> 
        revealed many examples of where individuals, communities and even countries 
        are vulnerable to threats from their physical environment. Environmental 
        change and social vulnerability to it is nothing new. More than 9 000 
        years ago, the Sumerians of Mesopotamia started irrigating land to meet 
        increased demand for food from a growing population but their civilization 
        eventually collapsed partly because of the waterlogging and salinization 
        that resulted. The Mayan civilization collapsed around 900 B.C. mainly 
        as a result of soil erosion, loss of agro-ecosystem viability and silting 
        of rivers. The Dust Bowl phenomenon of the American prairies in the 20th 
        century resulted from massive soil erosion, and led to communities being 
        uprooted and widespread poverty. During the three days of London's 'Great 
        Smog' of 1952, some 4 000 people died as a result of a lethal combination 
        of air laden with particulates and SO<sub>2</sub> from the widespread 
        burning of coal and a temperature inversion caused by anticyclonic conditions 
        over the city (Met Office 2002). </p>
      <p>Some people live in places of inherent risk to humans - areas, for example, 
        that are too hot, too dry or too prone to natural hazards. Others such 
        as Rosita Pedro are at risk because an existing threat has become more 
        severe or extensive through time. Places or conditions which were once 
        safe have been so altered that they no longer safeguard human health and 
        well-being adequately. Many of the children under the age of five who 
        die every year from diarrhoeal disease contract it from drinking contaminated 
        water (see Chapter 2, <a href="265.htm">'Freshwater'</a>).</p>
      <p>Most environments are in a constant state of flux because of natural 
        causes and human modifications for food production, settlements, infrastructure, 
        or to produce and trade goods. Most intentional changes are designed to 
        harness the environment for human benefit. Domestication of land for intensive 
        food production is one example; harnessing river resources to provide 
        fresh water, energy and transport is another. Such changes may also unintentionally 
        alter the quality or quantity of environmental resources and be difficult 
        to cope with.</p>
      <p>Analysing old and new threats to human security shows that human vulnerability 
        to environmental conditions has social, economic and ecological dimensions. 
        The most conspicuous and widely reported manifestation of this vulnerability 
        is when people are affected suddenly and violently by natural hazards 
        such as the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo resulting in the devastation 
        of the town of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo (see box). These 
        events turn into disasters when local communities are not able to cope 
        with their impacts. The environmental factors that contribute to human 
        vulnerability, however, are both varied and variable, and are not limited 
        to disaster events; they span the whole sustainable development spectrum.</p>

          <td>Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo has erupted 
            more than 50 times in the past 150 years. Despite this potential hazard, 
            the fertility of the surrounding area with its rich volcanic soils 
            and its proximity to the lake continues to attract people. The eruption 
            of Nyiragongo on 17 January 2002 affected an area already beset by 
            years of civil conflict, which had severely diminished people's coping 
            strategies. Residents received little warning of the impending eruption. 
            The town of Goma, 18 km from the volcano, was devastated by flows 
            of lava 1-2 metres high that engulfed the town and destroyed 14 nearby 
            villages. At least 147 people were killed and many more injured. Approximately 
            350 000 people were affected, with some 30 000 people displaced and 
            12 500 households destroyed.</td>
