      <p>Much of what is happening goes beyond mere dialogue. Rather than waiting 
        for political leaders to take the initiative, many individuals and groups 
        have begun to act on their own. They note the contrasting outcomes of 
        the 1992 Earth Summit on an informal and local scale, such as the spread 
        of Local Agenda 21 initiatives and those pitched at the more formal and 
        international level, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on 
        Climate Change. They draw inspiration from past and present efforts of 
        local grass-roots movements like the Green Belt movement in Kenya and 
        the Chipko Andalan movement in India. They also recall successful interventions 
        at international level, such as the campaign to end the production and 
        use of landmines.</p>
      <p>The business community is another source of inspiration, principally 
        for its success in developing social investment funds and establishing 
        social stock indices. Firms that address environmental issues ahead of 
        regulation, exemplified by companies in the Climate Neutral Network, serve 
        as role models. Also held up as role models are partnerships between governments 
        and other groups, such as Ecotourism Namibia and Community-Based Fisheries 
        Management in Phang-Nga Bay, Thailand.</p>
      <p>The more that individuals and groups apply themselves to practical initiatives, 
        the more hope grows that significant changes are possible. The media assist 
        by making these efforts more visible. Progressive elements in government 
        and business communities realize that this is the most promising channel 
        for reform. They also recognize that efforts like these are needed to 
        get to the sources of dissatisfaction that lie at the root of terrorist 
        activities. This realization leads to the creation of alliances amongst 
        individuals from various stakeholder groups in support of key initiatives.</p>
      <p>The result is a mixture of old and new initiatives. Some initiatives 
        are highly coordinated and involve large numbers of people. Others are 
        pursued by small groups with wide ranging, but loosely knit connections 
        at local, regional and global levels. Whereas some are formal and embedded 
        in national and international law, many take a voluntary approach, such 
        as the Global Reporting Initiative, Global Compact Initiative and financial 
        initiatives set up by the United Nations and businesses.</p>
      <p>Efforts continue to incorporate the results of scientific research and 
        analysis more thoroughly into the policy making process. The Millennium 
        Ecosystem Assessment, the Global International Water Assessment and new 
        studies on the nitrogen cycle and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) 
        complement the ongoing investigation of climate change by the Intergovernmental 
        Panel on Climate Change. The POPs assessment is in part a response to 
        compelling new evidence of the long-range transport of these pollutants 
        and the effects of their presence on animal life in the polar regions. 
        Much like the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the 1980s, 
        these revelations stimulate intense effort to measure and counter the 
        risk.</p>
      <p>These new assessments differ fundamentally from past efforts. Firstly, 
        they are designed to include more expertise from developing regions, and 
        to build capacity in these regions. Secondly, the contributions of social 
        scientists are given equal weight to those of the physical and natural 
        scientists. Thirdly, wherever possible, the many regional and local studies 
        that comprise large parts of these assessments recruit local and lay communities 
        as partners in the research. This stems from the desire of these groups 
        to have a voice in the development and understanding of the issues and 
        in how to address particular concerns.</p>
      <p>The knowledge that these individuals and groups (particularly indigenous 
        groups) possess has been accorded increasing recognition. The participatory 
        approach also acknowledges that scope for action extends beyond official 
        government channels and depends upon involvement of local communities.</p>

      <p>Setting goals and targets and designing activities to achieve them, builds 
        upon ongoing efforts, but also reflects progress in striking a balance 
        between formal and informal institutions. Social and environmental goals 
        are re-affirmed, among them reducing food insecurity and infant mortality, 
        increasing life expectancy and literacy, stabilizing climate, halting 
        deforestation and reversing declines in fisheries.</p>
      <p>Rather than laying down specific numbers, quotas and timetables, however, 
        more attention is paid to increasing accountability and transparency by 
        instituting monitoring systems and placing responsibility on governments, 
        industries, NGOs and others to disclose information in relation to agreed 
        goals. The underlying principle is that the widespread availability of 
        good information and appropriate checks and balances will encourage progress 
        towards these goals, either directly or by way of pressure from an increasingly 
        vocal citizenry. The goal of policy, in this scenario, is to support the 
        efforts of individuals and groups, in government as well as in civil society, 
        within the nonprofit sector as well in the marketplace, to pursue sustainable 
        development.</p>
      <p>This evolving approach calls for a reappraisal of existing multilateral 
        agreements. The list includes environmentally oriented agreements such 
        as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Basel Convention 
        on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their 
        Disposal. It also features more socially oriented conventions such as 
        those on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
        and on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p>The process of revision provides momentum, too, for the continuing reassessment 
        of international institutions of governance, with a view to transforming 
        them into more effective organizations. The United Nations, major financial 
        institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and the 
        IMF and the WTO are all included. Transparency and accountability are 
        key aspects of this course of action. Similar processes are ongoing in 
        business, voluntary and other sectors.</p>
      <p>At regional level, new and old organizations become increasingly active. 
        The Federation of Caribbean Nations grows out of the former CARICOM. In 
        Europe, the growth of the EU proceeds with considerable deference paid 
        to maintaining and improving relationships with the Russian Federation. 
        Africa sees the further evolution of the African Ministerial Conference 
        on the Environment (AMCEN). Most regions also explore greater integration 
        of policies related to trade, migration, the management of water resources 
        and similar transboundary issues. In this way, the regional efforts become 
        part of a semi-formal web of global public policy networks.</p>
