      <p>The Stockholm Conference projected that annual harvests could approximately 
        double from 1970 levels to 'rather more than 100 million tonnes' (UN 1972b), 
        although the depletion of some fisheries by overexploitation was also 
        recognized. In the same year the world's largest fishery, the Peruvian 
        anchovy, crashed spectacularly, a result of years of unsustainable harvests 
        precipitated by a strong El Niño event. Harvests from marine capture fisheries 
        did rise but failed to reach 100 million tonnes, fluctuating around 80-90 
        million tonnes from the mid- 1980s (see graph). Contrary to indications 
        that the global fisheries catch is stable, a recent study reveals that 
        catches have actually been declining for more than a decade (Watson and 
        Pauly 2001). The study shows that vast overreporting of catches by some 
        countries combined with the large and wildly fluctuating catch of the 
        Peruvian anchovy, have painted a false picture of the health of the oceans. 
        Aquaculture production, by contrast, has risen sharply but is entirely 
        dominated by Asia and the Pacific (see graph).</p>

      <p>The Stockholm Conference recommended two basic approaches to fisheries 
        management: improving management information through research, assessment 
        and monitoring, and international cooperation. Despite great improvement 
        in the quality and scope of fisheries information, better fisheries management 
        has generally not been achieved. There has been an almost inexorable global 
        trend towards increasingly intense exploitation and depletion of fisheries 
        stocks (see figure), three-quarters of which are maximally exploited (FAO 
        2001), and many have collapsed. Global agreements aimed at sustainable 
        fisheries exploitation include the adoption in 1995 of an Agreement on 
        the Conservation and Management of Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish 
        Stocks, and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries developed by 
        the FAO.</p>

      <a name="fig184"></a>Thirty years ago fisheries issues were considered almost 
      entirely in economic and political terms. Today fisheries activities are 
      increasingly recognized as environmental problems in the broader sense. 
      The global expansion in yields has been delivered by fishing on progressively 
      smaller species at lower levels in the marine food web (the knock-on effects 
      of which are not fully understood) as the top predators have been depleted 
      (Pauly and others 1998). The global by-catch of many million tonnes (Alverson 
      and others 1994) includes not only charismatic animals such as dolphins 
      and turtles but many other species. Effects on marine and coastal ecosystems 
      are poorly known but are probably substantial (Jennings and Kaiser 1998, 
      McManus, Reyes and Nañola 1997). Negative ecosystem impacts also result 
      from some types of fishing gear (such as that used for bottom trawling) 
      and destructive practices (such as blast fishing) which cause physical damage 
      to the habitat. Recognition of the complex inter-relationships between fisheries 
      and marine ecosystems, and the need for ecosystem considerations in the 
      management of capture fisheries, is reflected in the FAO Reykjavik Declaration 
      (2001) on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. 
      <p>While seafood is the primary source of protein for many coastal people, 
        especially the poor, the global demise of fisheries has not been driven 
        only by nutritional needs. Much of the catch is for luxury foods, or is 
        processed into livestock feed. The 'tragedy of the commons' - the absence 
        of a rational reason to restrain harvests that are freely available to 
        all - is one root cause of overfishing while at the other end of the spectrum 
        is so-called 'Malthusian overfishing' (Pauly 1990), when the desperately 
        poor have no choice but to glean the last of the resource. Many attempts 
        to manage fisheries sustainably have degenerated into a 'division of the 
        spoils' (Caldwell 1996). Political imperatives to maintain employment, 
        international competitiveness or sovereign rights of access have led to 
        fisheries subsidies estimated at up to US$20 billion annually (Milazzo 
        1998), although these are probably now declining.</p>
