      <p>Land degradation leads to a significant reduction of the productive capacity 
        of land. Human activities contributing to land degradation include unsuitable 
        agricultural land use, poor soil and water management practices, deforestation, 
        removal of natural vegetation, frequent use of heavy machinery, overgrazing, 
        improper crop rotation and poor irrigation practices. Natural disasters, 
        including droughts, floods and landslides, also contribute. A Global Assessment 
        of Soil Degradation (GLASOD) was undertaken in the early 1990s (Oldeman, 
        Hakkeling and Sombroek 1990, UNEP 1992) and a land degradation assessment 
        of drylands (LADA) was initiated by GEF and UNEP in 2000 and is now being 
        developed with FAO.</p>

      <p>It has been estimated that 23 per cent of all usable land (excluding 
        mountains and deserts, for example) has been affected by degradation to 
        a degree sufficient to reduce its productivity (UNEP 1992, Oldeman, Hakkeling 
        and Sombroek 1990). In the early 1990s, about 910 million ha of land were 
        classified as 'moderately degraded', with greatly reduced agricultural 
        productivity (see illustrations). A total of 305 million ha of soils ranged 
        between 'strongly degraded' (296 million ha) and 'extremely degraded' 
        (9 million ha, of which more than 5 million ha were in Africa). 'Extremely 
        degraded' soils are beyond restoration (Oldeman, Hakkeling and Sombroek 
        1990).</p>

      <p><a name="fig65"></a>Despite these compelling statistics on land degradation, 
        some studies are beginning to question the data, arguing that degradation 
        estimates are overstated. A major reason suggested for the overestimation 
        of land degradation has been underestimation of the abilities of local 
        farmers (Mazzucato and Niemeijer 2001). These authors argue that ' . experts 
        need to discriminate more carefully between a naturally bad state, a temporary 
        bad state and a degraded state of land'.</p>
      <p>Soil erosion is a major factor in land degradation and has severe effects 
        on soil functions - such as the soil's ability to act as a buffer and 
        filter for pollutants, its role in the hydrological and nitrogen cycle, 
        and its ability to provide habitat and support biodiversity. About 2 000 
        million ha of soil, equivalent to 15 per cent of the Earth's land area 
        (an area larger than the United States and Mexico combined), have been 
        degraded through human activities. The main types of soil degradation 
        are water erosion (56 per cent), wind erosion (28 per cent), chemical 
        degradation (12 per cent) and physical degradation (4 per cent). Causes 
        of soil degradation include overgrazing (35 per cent), deforestation (30 
        per cent), agricultural activities (27 per cent), overexploitation of 
        vegetation (7 per cent) and industrial activities (1 per cent) (GACGC 
        1994).</p>
      <p>Approaches to soil conservation have been greatly modified since the 
        1970s. Work used to concentrate on mechanical protection, such as bunds 
        and terraces, largely to control surface run-off. This has been supplemented 
        by a new approach (Shaxson and others 1989, Sanders and others 1999) which 
        calls for greater attention to biological methods of conservation, and 
        the integration of water conservation with soil protection, through improved 
        management of soilplant- water relationships, including reduced disturbance 
        by tillage (University of Bern and others 2000). Within the international 
        agricultural research system, the Consultative Group on International 
        Agricultural Research, there is now a commitment to natural resource management, 
        and explicit recognition of degraded land and desertification as environmental 
        problems (Shah and Strong 1999).</p>
      <p>Despite these developments, there is no clear indication that the rate 
        of land degradation has decreased. As yet, there are no continuously monitored 
        indicators of soil condition that would permit quantitatively based assessments 
        of changes over time, comparable to the monitoring of deforestation.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that soil monitoring should become a basic task 
        of national soil survey organizations (Young 1991) but this proposal has 
        yet to be widely adopted. An international programme was set up to develop 
        a set of land quality indicators (Pieri and others 1995), comparable to 
        those used to monitor economic and social conditions. The programme continues 
        on a modest scale under the Global Terrestrial Observation System.</p>
