      <p>With a growing population and economy, the demand for water in the region 
        is expected to grow in all scenarios. Policies regarding water pricing 
        and technological advances may temper this in all scenarios other than 
        <i>Security First</i>. Under the <i>Markets First </i>scenario, total 
        water withdrawals are expected to nearly double in Africa, with particularly 
        high increases in sub-Saharan Africa. The rise in water use linked to 
        economic growth will outpace any savings on a per unit basis in both agriculture 
        and industry. Similar increases are expected under <i>Security First </i>conditions, 
        although conflicts between nations and the generally slow growth in the 
        economy will slow the increased demand somewhat. Controls are largely 
        absent outside of the wealthy enclaves, although pollution from these 
        enclaves is likely to increasingly affect other areas. On both the <i>Markets 
        First </i>and the <i>Security First </i>horizons, the African population 
        living in areas under severe water stress increases to around 40 per cent 
        (see charts on the right). An especially steep rise in the number and 
        percentage of people affected occurs in Eastern Africa, as rising water 
        withdrawals in the Upper Nile river basin bring it into the severe water 
        stress category under both scenarios.</p>

      <p><a name="fig361a"></a>Water withdrawals increase in most of sub- Saharan 
        Africa under the <i>Policy First</i> and <i>Sustainability First</i> scenarios, 
        yet by considerably less than in the other two scenarios - due to a combination 
        of technology transfer and additional policies that encourage water savings. 
        With such policies in place, even water withdrawals in Northern Africa 
        are tempered, mainly by restructuring the irrigation sector. Efforts are 
        made to enhance transboundary basin-wide management of water resources, 
        and water quality issues receive particular attention by policy-makers, 
        especially as these are linked to human health. Nevertheless, as population 
        growth continues, the number of people living in areas with severe water 
        stress still doubles in Africa under these two more reform-oriented scenarios.</p>
      <p>The net result of all these effects is that the numbers of people living 
        in areas experiencing severe water stress increase in all sub-regions 
        in all scenarios, but most notably in <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security 
        First</i>. The percentage of people affected rises only slightly in <i>Policy 
        First</i> and <i>Sustainability First</i> for the region as a whole, but 
        varies within the region. Southern Africa, for example, sees a decline 
        in these scenarios whereas Western Africa has a marked increase. Under 
        <i>Markets First</i> and <i>Security First</i> there is an increase in 
        all parts of the region except the Western Indian Ocean islands. In all 
        scenarios, the most striking increases, in terms of percentages of the 
        population affected, occur in Eastern Africa. Arid Northern Africa continues 
        to have the highest percentage of the population impacted, whereas wet 
        Central Africa and the Western Indian Ocean Islands have the fewest. Of 
        course, the ability to cope with the stresses on freshwater supply will 
        differ across the scenarios and sub-regions.</p>

      <p>Trends in water and land, along with more broadly distributed economic 
        growth and effective social and economic policies, are reflected in the 
        incidence of hunger in the region (see charts above). Although the percentage 
        of people experiencing hunger falls in all scenarios, the reduction is 
        more than offset by a rise in total population in <i>Markets First </i>and 
        <i>Security First</i> over this period. In <i>Security First</i> the numbers 
        of people at risk rise by more than 50 per cent. Rising inequality in 
        both scenarios serves to negate any benefits of economic growth. Dramatic 
        improvements are possible, though, as seen in <i>Policy First</i> and 
        <i>Sustainability First</i>. A key here is the broader distribution of 
        economic growth, both between Africa and other regions, but also within 
        Africa itself.</p>
      <p>Increased food aid and reduced conflict also have direct effects. The 
        fundamental shifts in <i>Sustainability First</i> allow the total numbers 
        to be cut by more than half. Despite the progress made, however, certain 
        subregions remain problematic. Most notably, hunger levels in Eastern 
        Africa remain above 10 per cent, even under <i>Sustainability First</i>.</p>

              agreements and threatening sustainable development in the region.</p>
            <p>This is the first time that African countries have a regional organization 
              specifically dealing with environmental issues. Although it falls 
              under the aegis of the AU, the AEPC charter guarantees its autonomy 
              from political influence, though member states contribute directly 
              to its budget. The mandate of the AEPC is to not only promote the 
              adoption of new regional and sub-regional environmental agreements, 
              but also monitor national-level implementation through sub-regional
