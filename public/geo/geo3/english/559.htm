      <p>The risk of land degradation is linked to forest cover. A complex set 
        of forces determines the future of forests in the region. Population growth, 
        including urban expansion in all scenarios and economic improvements in 
        all but a <i>Security First </i>situation, lead to mounting demand for 
        agricultural land at the expense of forest area. Efforts to address the 
        problems of mega-cities in the worlds of <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>also increase deforestation as settlement programmes encourage 
        wider dispersal. In a <i>Security First </i>world there are added pressures 
        as the poor are pushed onto ever more marginal lands.</p>

      <p>These pressures are cushioned to some degree by advances in agricultural 
        technology but the effects differ across scenarios. Advances may be most 
        rapid in <i>Markets First</i>, but probably do not have environmental 
        protection as their key goal. More importantly, economic forces such as 
        rising prices for timber and non-timber forest products, which can encourage 
        both deforestation and reforestation, are balanced against reductions 
        in subsidies that have driven conversion of forest and woodlands to agriculture, 
        and other economic instruments introduced to improve conservation. These 
        all influence the area and condition of remaining forests. Market instruments 
        play the biggest role in a world of <i>Markets First</i>. These are complemented 
        in the worlds of <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>by 
        government and local programmes to subsidize reforestation and encourage 
        a shift to agroforestry, and by direct efforts to preserve biodiversity.</p>
      <p>The net result is that the total area of forest in Asia and the Pacific 
        declines over this period, but this effect differs significantly across 
        sub-regions and scenarios. South and Southeast Asia suffer the most significant 
        losses in total forest area. Whereas Northwest Pacific and East Asia experience 
        a net increase in forest area due to plantations, the total area of undisturbed 
        natural forest declines. In Australia and New Zealand and the South Pacific, 
        the effect of replanting is such that more new forest is created than 
        is used for logging or other production.</p>
      <p>Water stress is presently one of the most contentious problems in Asia 
        and the Pacific, leaving aside the small Pacific Island Countries (PICs), 
        and it remains high on the agenda for the foreseeable future (see on the 
        right). Growth in demand is especially high in a <i>Markets First </i>world, 
        but also in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First</i>, where 
        economic growth is similarly robust. Water pricing and more efficient 
        use of water in agriculture due to advances in biotechnology help to temper 
        this growth. Under the <i>Markets First</i> scenario, water withdrawals 
        increase in all sectors, especially when further expansion of irrigated 
        area is assumed. These increases in water withdrawals lead to an expansion 
        of areas with severe water stress in South and Southeast Asia in all scenarios 
        and more people are affected throughout the region. In <i>Security First 
        </i>overall growth in demand is moderated by slower economic growth in 
        many sub-regions and no further expansion in irrigated areas, rather than 
        any significant efforts to become more efficient.</p>

      <p>Under the <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability First </i>scenarios, 
        where effective policies and lifestyle changes combine with greater regional 
        cooperation and technology transfer, water withdrawals remain at current 
        levels or even decrease in most of the rest of Asia. However, with population 
        growth continuing, the number of people living in areas under severe water 
        stress continues to increase across Asia.</p>
      <p>Urban areas, especially the growing mega-cities in South, Southeast and 
        East Asia, face many trials in addition to water stress. They include 
        land use pressures, air and water pollution and solid waste overload. 
        All these challenges are related to rapidly growing populations, from 
        both natural growth and rural-urban migration, and increasing economic 
        activity. Trends in local and regional air pollution depend heavily on 
        choices in energy production. If coal continues to dominate, as is likely 
        in a <i>Security First </i>situation with reduced trade or in a world 
        of <i>Markets First </i>where the cost is what counts, then local air 
        pollution tends to worsen significantly.<br clear="all">

      <p>Similarly, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and production of solid waste (see 
        above) increase in most scenarios. Emission standards, which tend to be 
        weak or lacking in a <i>Security First </i>situation, help to limit the 
        growth in air pollutants in the other scenarios, especially in <i>Policy 
        First</i>. Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> increase more rapidly in <i>Markets 
        First </i>circumstances because of high economic growth. In <i>Policy 
        First</i>, advanced technologies are introduced to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions. Because a <i>Sustainability First </i>society shifts from conventional 
        to sustainable lifestyles, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are somewhat mitigated. 
        On the other hand a <i>Security First </i>society holds on to technologies 
        with low energy efficiency. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase most rapidly 
        in this scenario everywhere except in Central Asia where low economic 
        activities mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vis-à-vis <i>Markets First</i>. 
        The effects of lifestyle changes are also evident in the lower levels 
        of solid waste production in <i>Sustainability First</i>.</p>
