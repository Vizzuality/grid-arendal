      <p>Bio-invasion is now thought to be the second gravest threat to biodiversity 
        in North America, after habitat destruction and degradation (CEC 2000). 
        Competition or predation by non-native species imperils nearly half of 
        the species listed as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered 
        Species Act (Wilcove and others 1998). In Canada, alien species have been 
        involved in causing risk to about 25 per cent of endangered, 31 per cent 
        of threatened and 16 per cent of vulnerable species (Lee 2001).</p>

            <p>The Everglades is the central part of a 23 000 km<sup>2</sup> watershed covering 
              the lower third of Florida. In the early 1900s, large tracts were 
              drained and water supplies reconfigured. Protected from flooding 
              by levees and canals, South Florida became home to six million people 
              along the Miami-Palm Beach corridor and an important sugarcane, 
              fruit and vegetable producer (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). 
            </p>
            <p>Originally stretching over 11 650 km<sup>2</sup>, nearly half of the Everglades 
              wetlands have been lost, reducing the amount of freshwater flowing 
              to the coast, disrupting salinity levels and altering the natural 
              capacity of the ecosystem to store and release water. The state 
              of the Everglades deteriorated most rapidly over the past two decades 
              with sea grass die-offs, the invasion of non-native species, nutrient 
              contamination, large algal blooms in Florida Bay and declines in 
              fishing harvests and some bird populations (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank 
              and WRI 2000).</p>
            <p>Regional efforts to address the problems began in the early 1980s 
              but it took until 1998 for all parties - the sugar industry, environmentalists, 
              real estate developers and American Indian tribes - to come together 
              in support of a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve the Everglades. 
              Developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, it is the world's most 
              ambitious and extensive wetlands restoration effort, costing the 
              federal government US$7.8 billion. It will take more than 20 years 
              to complete (Alvarez 2000, Army Corps of Engineers 2000).</p>

      <p>Invasive aquatic species are particularly threatening to wetland and 
        freshwater ecosystems (see box below) and can also pose serious health 
        risks. For example, human cholera bacteria were found in ballast tanks 
        and in oyster and fin-fish samples in Mobile, Alabama, in 1991 (ANS 2000). 
        Alien aquatic species are expected to contribute to the extinction of 
        native freshwater species in North America at a rate of 4 per cent a decade 
        over the next century (Ricciardi and Rasmussen 1999).</p>

            <p>Bio-invasion is the influx of alien invasive species. Alien species 
              are considered invasive when they become established in natural 
              habitats, are agents of change, and threaten native biological diversity. 
              Alien invasive species include bacteria, viruses, fungi, insects, 
              molluscs, plants, fish, mammals and birds (IUCN 2001).</p>
            <p>Species that become invasive can be introduced either intentionally 
              or unintentionally through pathways (or vectors). These include 
              transportation (by water, land and air; in the goods themselves, 
              in dunnage, packing materials or containers, in or on ships, planes, 
              trains, trucks or cars); agriculture; horticulture and plant nursery 
              stock; aquaculture industry; live food fish industry; bait fish; 
              ornamental pond, water garden and the aquarium pet trades. Where 
              there are no natural predators, they can come to dominate ecosystems, 
              and can alter the composition and structure of food webs, nutrient 
              cycles, fire cycles, and hydrology and energy budgets, threatening 
              agricultural productivity and other industries dependent on living 
              resources (Alonso and others 2001).</p>
            <p>As an example, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), which was 
              introduced from Europe in the mid-1800s as a garden ornamental, 
              has been spreading in North America at a rate of 115 000 ha a year, 
              invading wetland habitats where it dominates native plants and deprives 
              waterfowl and other species of food sources (Haber 1996, Pimentel 
              and others 1999). When non-indigenous aquatic weeds such as purple 
              loosestrife, Eurasian water milfoil and hydrilla replace native 
              species, they establish dense colonies that can impair navigation, 
              water-based recreation and flood control; degrade water quality 
              and wildlife habitat; accelerate the filling of lakes and reservoirs; 
              and depress property values (Haber 1996).</p>
          </td>

      </table>
      <p>The high economic costs of damage caused by bioinvasions in North America 
        is causing increasing concern. Both countries have developed monitoring 
        plans and information systems to help control bioinvasion (Haber 1996, 
        Kaiser 1999).</p>
      <p>Responses to the challenge of invasive species include legislation, policies, 
        and plans and programmes that focus on preventing the invasion of new 
        species and the eradication or control of established ones. Canada and 
        the United States cooperate in programmes related to invasive species 
        in the Great Lakes, for example. Despite requirements for ships to exchange 
        ballast water at sea, however, the influx of new species into the Great 
        Lakes continues and is considered to be a serious threat to the integrity 
        of the Great Lakes ecosystem.</p>
      <p>As trade increases, new invasions are expected. In addition, it may be 
        that global climate change could create conditions that are even more 
        conducive to bioinvasion (Holmes 1998). North American as well as global 
        cooperation is essential to stem the tide of bioinvasion and the damage 
        it causes.</p>
