      <p>Many countries do not have sufficient water to meet demand, with the 
        result that aquifer depletion due to overextraction is common. Moreover, 
        the scarcity of water is accompanied by a deterioration in the quality 
        of available water due to pollution and environmental degradation. Dams 
        and reservoirs coupled with deforestation in some watersheds have reduced 
        stream water levels, lowered water tables, degraded riparian wetlands 
        and diminished freshwater aquatic diversity. Excessive demand for groundwater 
        in coastal cities such as Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Karachi and Manila 
        has led to saline intrusion and ground subsidence.</p>
      <p>Government policies and strategies have traditionally been concerned 
        with increasing supply. However, policies have recently become increasingly 
        focused on an integrated approach to water resource management by emphasizing 
        demand management measures such as efficient water use, conservation and 
        protection, institutional arrangements, legal, regulatory and economic 
        instruments, public information and inter-agency cooperation. Common elements 
        in the national policies and strategies now being adopted include integration 
        of water resources development and management into socio-economic development; 
        assessment and monitoring of water resources; protection of water and 
        associated resources; provision of safe drinking water supply and sanitation; 
        conservation and sustainable use of water for food production and other 
        economic activities; institutional and legislative development; and public 
        participation.</p>
      <p>In India, a new irrigation management policy aims to improve water application 
        efficiency through the use of modern technologies such as drip/sprinkler 
        irrigation and better on-farm irrigation measures. In the Republic of 
        Korea, where agriculture uses more than 50 per cent of water resources, 
        the government's water resources development plan for the 21st century 
        highlights measures that relate to increased food production with efficient 
        water use (Kwun 1999). Decentralized water management is also being encouraged 
        in countries such as China where city or provincial authorities are authorized 
        to manage water resources. In India, multidisciplinary units in charge 
        of developing comprehensive water plans have been established in some 
        states. Stakeholder participation has reduced operational costs in countries 
        such as Pakistan by involving communities in the development of water 
        supply, sanitation, and water pollution prevention facilities and their 
        maintenance.</p>
      <p>Progress has also been made in adopting a basinwide approach. The Indus 
        Basin water-sharing accord between India and Pakistan, the acclaimed Water 
        Sharing Treaty between India and Bangladesh, the India-Bhutan cooperation 
        on hydropower development and India-Nepal cooperation in harnessing transboundary 
        rivers are examples of transboundary cooperation on water management in 
        South Asia.</p>
      <p>A major challenge is to change the fragmented sub-sectoral approaches 
        to water management that have caused conflict and competition in the past, 
        and to design and implement integrated mechanisms, particularly for projects 
        that transcend sub-sectors.</p>

            <p>North-South cooperation between organizations in Indonesia and 
              the United States has contributed to enhanced catchment management 
              in the Lake Toba watershed - the world's largest volcanic crater 
              lake, which covers about 4 000 km<sup>2</sup>. The Indonesian lake, 
              which suffers from degraded water quality, loss of biological diversity 
              and invasions of troublesome non-native plants and animals, has 
              benefited from institutional cooperation between the Lake Toba Heritage 
              Foundation and the Lake Champlain Basin Programme (LCBP) in Vermont, 
              United States. The Foundation used part of a grant from the United 
              States Agency for International Development to establish a sister 
              lakes relationship with the LCBP. The exchange programme has helped 
              address freshwater management issues in the Lake Toba catchment 
              using experiences from another catchment and region.</p>
            <p>The programme demonstrates the following lessons:</p>
