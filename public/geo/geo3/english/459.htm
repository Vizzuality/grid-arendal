      <p>Environmental degradation and change are becoming increasingly important 
        in relation to both the occurrence and impact of natural disasters. Deforestation, 
        for example, is now frequently linked to severe flood events and landslides. 
        Overexploitation of water resources has already resulted in sub-regional 
        environmental disasters such as the drying up of the Aral Sea in Central 
        Asia (see box below and <a href="485.htm">feature</a>).</p>

                  <p>The destruction of the Aral Sea is now a wellknown example 
                    of unsustainable development. Atlases used to describe the 
                    sea as the world's fourth largest lake, with an area of 66 
                    000 km<sup>2</sup> and a volume of more than 1 000 km<sup>3</sup>. 
                    Its waters supplied local fisheries with annual catches of 
                    40 000 tonnes, while the deltas of its tributaries hosted 
                    dozens of smaller lakes and biologically rich marshes and 
                    wetlands covering 550 000 ha.</p>
                  <p>In the 1960s, planners in the former Soviet Union assigned 
                    Central Asia the role of supplier of raw cotton. Irrigation 
                    was imperative, and the Aral Sea and its tributaries seemed 
                    a limitless source of water. Irrigated land was expanded from 
                    about 4.5 million ha in 1960 to almost 7 million ha in 1980. 
                    The local population also grew rapidly, from 14 million to 
                    about 27 million in the same period, while total water withdrawal 
                    almost doubled to an annual 120 km<sup>3</sup>, more than 
                    90 per cent of it for agriculture.</p>
                  <p>The result was the collapse of the prevailing water balance 
                    in the basin. Waterlogging and salinization eventually affected 
                    about 40 per cent of irrigated land. Overuse of pesticides 
                    and fertilizer polluted surface water and groundwater, and 
                    the delta ecosystems simply perished: by 1990, more than 95 
                    per cent of the marshes and wetlands had given way to sand 
                    deserts, and more than 50 delta lakes, covering 60 000 ha, 
                    had dried up.</p>
                  <p> The surface of the Aral Sea shrank by one-half and its volume 
                    by three-quarters. The mineral content of the water has increased 
                    fourfold, preventing the survival of most of the sea's fish 
                    and wildlife. Commercial fishing ended in 1982. Former seashore 
                    villages and towns are now 70 km from the present shoreline.</p>
                  <p> Communities face appalling health problems. In Karakalpakstan, 
                    Uzbekistan, drinking water is saline and polluted, with a 
                    high content of metals that causes a range of diseases. Over 
                    the past 15 years, there has been a 3 000 per cent increase 
                    in chronic bronchitis and in kidney and liver diseases, especially 
                    cancer, while arthritic diseases have increased 6 000 per 
                    cent. The infant mortality rate is one of the world's highest.</p>
                  <p>Five newly independent Central Asian states have now established 
                    a joint commission for water coordination. Several international 
                    organizations and bilateral agencies are providing assistance, 
                    and an International Fund for the Aral Sea and the Interstate 
                    Council for the Aral Sea Problem have been set up to coordinate 
                    initiatives.</p>
                  <p>The Central Asian republics have decided to focus on demand 
                    management, aiming to reduce water withdrawal by raising irrigation 
                    efficiency. The primary objective is to satisfy crop water 
                    requirements. Total water withdrawal in the basin has now 
                    stabilized at 110-120 km<sup>3</sup>/year but environmental 
                    degradation continues.</p>

      <p>Most of the countries in the Northwest Pacific and East Asia sub-region 
        and the Pacific Island countries will be particularly vulnerable to climate 
        change and associated sea-level rise because so many human settlements 
        and so much industrial infrastructure are located in coastal or lowland 
        areas. For the small island developing states, climate change and extreme 
        weather events may also have dramatic impacts on terrestrial biodiversity, 
        subsistence cropping and forest food sources (IPCC 1998).</p>
      <p>Rapid population growth, urbanization and weak land-use planning are 
        some of the reasons why poor people move to fragile and high risk areas 
        which are more exposed to natural hazards. Moreover, the rapid growth 
        of industries in urban areas has induced rural-urban migration. This has 
        sometimes led to more people being exposed to technological hazards such 
        as the disaster in Bhopal, India, in 1984, in which escaping methyl isocyanate 
        from an industrial plant killed more than 3 000 and affected more than 
        200 000 others (Robins 1990).</p>
