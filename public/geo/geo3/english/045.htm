      <p>In terms of demonstrable action, Stockholm apparently achieved much. 
        While many of its 109 recommendations remain unfulfilled, they serve - 
        now as then - as important targets. Equally important, however, were the 
        Conference's achievements in repairing rifts, and in narrowing the gap 
        between the views of the developed and the developing nations. The first 
        attempt at this had been made at a conference in Founex, Switzerland, 
        in 1969, and the Founex Report of June 1971 identified development and 
        environment as 'two sides of the same coin' (UNEP 1981). The Drafting 
        and Planning Committee for the Stockholm conference noted in its report 
        in April 1972 that 'environmental protection must not be an excuse for 
        slowing down the economic progress of emerging countries'.</p>
      <p>Further progress had to wait until 1974 when asymposium of experts chaired 
        by the late Barbara Ward, was held in Cocoyoc, Mexico. Organized by UNEP 
        and the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the 
        symposium identified the economic and social factors which lead to environmental 
        deterioration (UNEP/UNCTAD 1974). The Cocoyoc Declaration - the formal 
        statement issued by the symposium - was influential in changing the attitudes 
        of leading environmental thinkers. What was said at Cocoyoc foreshadowed 
        the first paragraph of the World Conservation Strategy published in 1980 
        (see page 9) and was re-stated in GEO-2000 in 1999: 'The combined destructive 
        impacts of a poor majority struggling to stay alive and an affluent minority 
        consuming most of the world's resources are undermining the very means 
        by which all people can survive and flourish' (UNEP/UNCTAD 1974). </p>
      <p>Other statements in the Cocoyoc Declaration illustrate awareness of the 
        difficulty of meeting human needs sustainably from an environment under 
        pressure:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li> 'The problem today is not one primarily of absolute physical 
          shortage but of economic and<br>
          social maldistribution and usage.'<br>
        </li>
        <li>'The task of statesmanship is to guide the nations towards a 
          new system more capable of meeting<br>
          the inner limits of basic human needs for all the world's people 
          and of doing so without violating<br>
          the outer limits of the planet's resources and environment.'<br>
        </li>
        <li>'Human beings have basic needs: food, shelter, clothing, health, 
          education. Any process of growth<br>
          that does not lead to their fulfilment - or, even worse, disrupts 
          them - is a travesty of the idea of<br>
          development.'<br>
        </li>
        <li>'We are all in need of a redefinition of our goals, or new development 
          strategies, or new lifestyles,<br>
          including more modest patterns of consumption among the rich.'</li>
      </ul>

      <p><a name="fig7"></a>The Cocoyoc Declaration ends:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>'The road forward does not lie through the despair of doomwatching 
          or through the easy optimism of successive technological fixes. It lies 
          through a careful and dispassionate assessment of the 'outer limits', 
          through cooperative search for ways to achieve the 'inner limits' of 
          fundamental human rights, through the building of social structures 
          to express those rights, and through all the patient work of devising 
          techniques and styles of development which enhance and preserve our 
          planetary inheritance.'</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This vision of the way forward was reflected in the detailed new images 
        of the planet that appeared in the 1970s as a result of the launch by 
        the United States in July 1972 of the Landsat satellite. Such images were 
        undoubtedly instrumental in changing human attitudes to the state of the 
        planet's environment. Sadly, the 30- year record that Landsat has provided 
        also shows that attitudes have not yet changed enough (see photos).</p>
      <p>In terms of climate change, growing concern about global warming (the 
        Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius had in 1896 warned the world about 
        the 'greenhouse effect') led to the first World Climate Conference in 
        Geneva in February 1979 (Centre for Science and Environment 1999). It 
        concluded that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions could have a long-term 
        effect on climate. The World Climate Programme (WCP) was established the 
        following year, providing the framework for international cooperation 
        in research and the platform for identifying the important climate issues 
        of the 1980s and 1990s, including ozone depletion and global warming.</p>
