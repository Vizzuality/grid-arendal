      <p>Wood supply and production remains the focus of most forest inventories. 
        More than one-third of aboveground woody biomass is located in South America, 
        with 27 per cent in Brazil alone. Estimates by FAO (2000) show that global 
        production of total roundwood reached 3 335 million m<sup>3</sup> in 1999. 
        Just over half of this was fuelwood, about 90 per cent of which was produced 
        and consumed in developing countries. On the other hand, industrial roundwood 
        production, 1 550 million m<sup>3</sup> in 1999, was dominated by developed 
        countries, which together accounted for 79 per cent of total global production. 
        The overall trend for industrial roundwood production was relatively flat 
        during the 1990s. This was a significant change from the rapid growth 
        that occurred prior to 1990. </p>
      <p>Commercial logging methods are often destructive and contribute directly 
        or indirectly to deforestation. In West Africa, it was estimated that 
        in obtaining 1 m<sup>3 </sup>of logs, about 2 m<sup>3</sup> of standing 
        trees are destroyed (Serageldine 1990). Logging is especially damaging 
        on steep slopes or in sensitive ecosystems such as transitional forests 
        and mangroves (see box below). Where certain species are selected, non-target 
        species can also be damaged. Clearing of forests impacts most severely 
        on local populations, who lose vital sources of food, fuel, construction 
        materials, medicines and areas for livestock grazing. It also exposes 
        soils and shade species to wind, sunlight, evaporation and erosion, accelerating 
        siltation in dams, rivers and the coastal zone, as well as causing severe 
        floods. </p>

              of sub-tropical and tropical shores of Africa, Australia, Asia and 
              the Americas. They line about 25 per cent of tropical coastlines.Mangrove 
              forests are among the world's most biologically diverse and productive 
              systems. They provide food and refuge for many species and nutrients 
              for the marine environment Mangroves also act as nursery grounds 
              for fish and shellfish, and are prime nesting andmigratory sites 
              for hundreds of bird species (see photo). In Belize, for instance, 
              more than 500 species of birds have been recorded in mangrove areas. 
              Mangroves also help protect coastlines from erosion, storm damage 
              and wave action, and protect coral reefs and sea grass beds from 
              damaging siltation. Local communities are provided with timber and 
              fuelwood from mangrove forests.</p>
            <p>Mangroves are threatened by activities such as overharvesting, 
              freshwater diversion, pollution, prolonged flooding and fluctuating 
              sea levels. In addition, the charcoal and timber industries, tourism 
              and other coastal developments are destroying mangrove forests. 
              The rapidly expanding shrimp aquaculture industry poses the gravest 
              threat - as much as 50 per cent of recent mangrove destruction has 
              been due to clear-cutting for shrimp farms.</p>
            <p>Thailand has lost more than half of its mangrove forests since 
              1960. In the Philippines, mangroves declined from an estimated 448 
              000 ha in the 1920s to only 110 000 ha in 1990. In Ecuador, the 
              Muisne region has lost nearly 90 per cent of its mangroves. Globally, 
              about half of the world's mangrove forests may have been lost. </p>

      <p>There is a global trend towards greater reliance on plantations as a 
        source of industrial wood. The development of a significant global plantation 
        estate is quite recent; half of all plantations in the world are less 
        than 15 years old. Asia has led plantation establishment globally; as 
        of 2000, about 62 per cent of all forest plantations were located in that 
        region. Other significant developments include: rising private sector 
        investment in plantations in developing countries; increasing foreign 
        investments in plantations; and an expansion of 'outgrower' schemes whereby 
        communities or small landowners produce trees for sale to private companies 
        (FAO 2001b). Forest plantations typically contain only one, or a few, 
        species, which makes them less biologically diverse and more susceptible 
        to diseases and other disturbances than natural forests. </p>
      <p>Forest industries continue to adapt to changes in raw materials, namely 
        the increased supply of plantation wood and of a wider range of species. 
        Recently there has been an emergence of innovative ways to make better 
        use of available supplies and of residues and waste. Such new developments 
        include laminated veneer lumber, glue-laminated timbers and products based 
        on wood fibres. In addition, modern technologies that reduce environmental 
        impacts, through pollution control and other means, are now available 
        to wood-processing industries (FAO 2001a). </p>
      <p>In addition, many countries have imposed bans on timber harvesting, either 
        to conserve their forest resources or as a response to devastating natural 
        calamities (such as landslides and flooding) that are attributed, rightly 
        or wrongly, to excessive commercial logging. The effects of logging bans 
        differ widely with the type of policy, the products affected, market conditions, 
        etc. In some situations, logging bans can shift harvesting pressure from 
        one region to another, affect forest-dependent communities, increase or 
        decrease employment opportunities, and disrupt markets (FAO 2001a). There 
        is also increasing interest in forest certification which offers the potential 
        to provide a market incentive for better forest management (see box).

            <p>Forest management certification has been strongly promoted by civil 
              society over the past decade. It resulted from public disillusionment 
              with the failure of governments and intergovernmental bodies to 
              improve forest management or tackle deforestation effectively, and 
              the lack of discrimination by forest industries about the source 
              of their products.</p>
            <p>Forest certification is a voluntary, market-based instrument that 
              enables consumers to identify forest products with high environmental 
              standards. By focusing on quality of forest management rather than 
              the quality of forest products, it contributes to the growing trend 
              to define production and process standards for social and environmental 
              performance in resource management. Three main certification approaches 
              are in operation:</p>
            <ul class="global">
              <li>Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) accreditation - an international 
                system which requires producers to meet a global set of Principles 
                and Standards for good forest stewardship and provides a trademark 
                for product labelling;</li>
              <li>Certification of the Environmental Management System (EMS) under 
                the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14000 
                series; and</li>
              <li>national certification schemes, some of which also incorporate 
                elements of the FSC and ISO approaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By the end of 2000, about 2 per cent of the global forest had been 
              certified for sustainable forest management. About 92 per cent of 
              these forests were located in Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, 
              Poland, Sweden and the United States. At the same time, only four 
              countries with tropical moist forests (Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala 
              and Mexico) had more than 100 000 ha of certified forests, with 
              a combined total of 1.8 million ha. An increasing number of large 
              retail 'do-ityourself'chains in Europe and the United States and 
              some major house-builders in the United States have announced that 
              they will favour certified wood products in the future. Buyers' 
              groups that have committed themselves to trading only in products 
              from certified sources are also on the increase.</p>
            <p>Many more millions of hectares are in the process of certification 
              although the concept is still hotly debated in many countries. Producer 
              countries and trade groups tend to consider it restrictive whilst 
              consumer countries with strong environmental lobbies have stressed 
              its potential benefits. Although there is little evidence as yet 
              about the local and market impacts of certification the contribution 
              of this voluntary procedure to good policy is evident. Setting up 
              the system has provided a forum for stakeholders to discuss broader 
              forest policy issues. It has also been successful in moving decision-making 
              powers away from some minorities with vested interests.</p>

      <p>Trade trends in forest products show an increased proportion of the total 
        production of wood products being exported, increased domestic wood processing 
        prior to export, increased trade among developing countries (particularly 
        in Asia) and trade liberalization at a global level. At the same time 
        some countries are introducing export restrictions to address national 
        environmental and market problems. Forest trade and environment issues 
        have been under consideration by both the World Trade Organization Committee 
        on Trade and Environment and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests. Impacts 
        of trade on some commercial tree species are currently under review by 
        a working group of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
        Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (FAO 2001a). </p>
