      <p><a name="fig214"></a>Scientists have known about the natural 'greenhouse 
        effect' for more than a century (Arrhenius 1896): the Earth maintains 
        its equilibrium temperature through a delicate balance between the incoming 
        solar energy (short wavelength radiation) it absorbs and the outgoing 
        infra-red energy (long wavelength radiation) that it emits and some of 
        which escapes into space. Greenhouse gases (water vapour, carbon dioxide, 
        methane and others) allow solar radiation to pass through the Earth's 
        atmosphere almost unimpeded but they absorb the infra-red radiation from 
        the Earth's surface and then re-radiate some of it back to the Earth. 
        This natural greenhouse effect keeps the surface temperature about 33°C 
        warmer than it would otherwise be - warm enough to sustain life.</p>
      <p>Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
        one of the major greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere has increased significantly 
        (see graph, which reflects growth since direct measurements started in 
        1957). This has contributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect known as 
        'global warming'.</p>
      <p>The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere is currently about 
        370 parts per million (ppm) - an increase of more than 30 per cent since 
        1750. The increase is largely due to anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        from fossil fuel combustion and to a lesser extent land-use change, cement 
        production and biomass combustion (IPCC 2001a). Although CO<sub>2</sub> 
        accounts for more than 60 per cent of the additional greenhouse effect 
        accumulated since industrialization, the concentrations of other greenhouse 
        gases such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), 
        halocarbons and halons have also increased. In comparison to CO<sub>2</sub>, 
        CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O have contributed about 20 per cent and 
        6-7 per cent respectively to the additional greenhouse effect. Halocarbons 
        have contributed about 14 per cent. Many of these chemicals are regulated 
        under the Montreal Protocol (see above). However, those which have negligible 
        ozone-depleting potential are not controlled under the Montreal Protocol. 
        Although they have accounted for less than 1 per cent of the additional 
        greenhouse effect since industrialization, their concentrations in the 
        atmosphere are increasing (IPCC 2001a).</p>
      <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are unevenly distributed between countries and 
        regions. In general, industrialized countries are responsible for the 
        majority of historical and current emissions. OECD countries contributed 
        more than half of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1998, with an average per 
        capita emission of about three times the world average. However the OECD's 
        share of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions has decreased by 11 per cent 
        since 1973 (IEA 2000).</p>
      <p>In assessing the possible impact of rising atmospheric concentrations 
        of greenhouse gases, IPCC concluded in 2001 that 'there is new and stronger 
        evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable 
        to human activities'. The overall warming amounts to about 0.6 (±0.2)°C 
        over the 20th century; the 1990s are 'very likely' to have been the warmest 
        decade and the year 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental record, 
        since 1861. Much of the rise in sea level over the past 100 years (about 
        10 to 20 cm) has probably been related to the concurrent rise in the global 
        temperature (IPCC 2001a).</p>
      <p>Ecosystems, human health and economy are all sensitive to changes in 
        climate - including both the magnitude and rate of climate change. Whereas 
        many regions are likely to experience adverse effects of climate change 
        - some of which are potentially irreversible - some effects could be beneficial 
        for some regions. Climate change represents an important additional stress 
        on those ecosystems already affected by increasing resource demands, unsustainable 
        management practices and pollution.</p>
      <p>Some of the first results of the changing climate can serve as indicators. 
        Several vulnerable ecosystems such as coral reefs are seriously endangered 
        by increased sea temperature (IPCC 2001b) and some populations of migratory 
        birds have been declining because of unfavourable variations in climatic 
        conditions (Sillett, Holmes and Sherry 2000). Climate change is furthermore 
        likely to affect human health and well-being through a variety of mechanisms. 
        For example, it can adversely affect the availability of freshwater, food 
        production, and the distribution and seasonal transmission of vector-borne 
        infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and schistosomiasis. 
        The additional stress of climate change will interact in different ways 
        across regions. It can be expected to reduce the ability of some environmental 
        systems to provide, on a sustained basis, key goods and services needed 
        for successful economic and social development, including adequate food, 
        clean air and water, energy, safe shelter and low levels of diseases (IPCC 
        2001b).</p>

      <p><a name="fig215"></a>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
        Change (UNFCCC) adopted at UNCED in 1992 (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 
        1</a>) has the ultimate objective of 'stabilization of greenhouse gas 
        concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
        anthropogenic interference with the climate system' (UNFCCC 1992). The 
        Convention further defines several principles of fundamental importance, 
        for example that parties should take precautionary measures and act 'on 
        the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated 
        responsibilities'. Being a framework treaty, the UNFCCC contained only 
        a non-binding recommendation for industrialized countries to return to 
        the 1990 emission levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases 
        (not controlled by the Montreal Protocol) by the year 2000 (UNFCCC 1992). 
        However, most of them have not returned anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse 
        gases to 1990 levels (UNFCCC 2001). In general, global emissions of almost 
        all anthropogenic greenhouse gases, particularly CO<sub>2</sub>, continue 
        to increase (IEA 2000). This reflects the inadequacy of national and international 
        policies and measures to address climate change.</p>
      <p>In its <i>Second Assessment Report</i>, the IPCC stated that the 'balance 
        of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global 
        climate' (IPCC 1996). This unequivocal statement provided the scientific 
        basis for the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC in December 
        1997. The protocol contains, for the first time, greenhouse gas reduction 
        targets for most industrialized countries. The targets, however, range 
        from an obligation to reduce emissions by 8 per cent (for the European 
        Union and many Central European countries) to a permission to increase 
        emissions by 10 per cent (Iceland) and 8 per cent (Australia). Overall, 
        industrialized countries are required to reduce their aggregated emissions 
        to at least 5 per cent below the 1990 level in the period 2008-12. No 
        new obligations were introduced for developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol 
        also allows collective implementation of obligations by means of applying 
        the so-called 'Kyoto mechanisms'. These mechanisms aim at providing 'geographical 
        flexibility' and reducing the costs of complying with the Kyoto targets. 
        For example, one of them - the Clean Development Mechanism - allows industrialized 
        countries to receive emission credits for carrying out projects aimed 
        at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in developing countries (UNFCCC 
        1997).</p>

            <p>Scientists began to attract policy-makers' attention to global 
              warming as an emerging global threat in the early 1970s (SCEP 1970). 
              However their appeals were originally ignored and, as economies 
              grew, more fossil fuels were burnt, more forested areas were cleared 
              for agriculture and more halocarbons were produced. It took a further 
              20 years of continuous effort by scientists, NGOs, international 
              organizations and several governments to get the international community 
              to agree to coordinated action to address climate change.</p>
            <p>The Stockholm Conference is generally regarded as the starting 
              point for international efforts on climate variations and climate 
              change (UN 1972). In 1979, the first World Climate Conference in 
              Geneva expressed concern about the atmospheric commons. This event 
              was attended primarily by scientists and received little attention 
              from policy-makers. In the 1980s, a series of conferences and workshops 
              were held in Villach, Austria, where scenarios for future emissions 
              of all of the significant greenhouse gases were considered. At the 
              1985 Villach meeting, an international group of scientific experts 
              reached a consensus on the seriousness of the problem and the danger 
              of significant warming (WMO 1986).</p>
            <p>As a result of growing public pressure and the implications of 
              the Brundtland Commission (WCED 1987), the problem of global climate 
              change moved onto the political agenda of several governments. A 
              diplomatic breakthrough came at the 1988 Toronto Conference on the 
              Changing Atmosphere from which emerged a recommendation calling 
              on developed nations to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 20 per 
              cent from 1988 levels by the year 2005. A few months later, IPCC 
              was jointly established by WMO and UNEP to review knowledge of the 
              science, impact, economics of, and the options for mitigating and/or 
              adapting to climate change. The IPCC studies, especially the three 
              extensive <i>Assessment Reports</i> in 1990, 1995 and 2001, covered 
              all the different facets of climate change.</p>

      <p>The cost estimates for industrialized countries to implement the Kyoto 
        Protocol range between 0.1 and 2 per cent of GDP in 2010 (IPCC 2001c) 
        with most impact being felt by the economies most dependent on fossil 
        fuels. In view of anticipated economic losses, some industrialized nations 
        have prejudiced the Kyoto commitments and the Kyoto Protocol as a whole. 
        Debates on rules and modalities of the implementation of the protocol 
        continued until the 6th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC held in 
        November 2000 in The Hague. As negotiating parties still failed to reach 
        consensus, the conference was suspended and parties decided to resume 
        negotiations in 2001. The pivotal point in the global discussion occurred 
        in March 2001 when the US government decided not to introduce any legal 
        restrictions, as implied by the Kyoto Protocol, on anthropogenic emissions 
        of greenhouse gases. The US administration thus declared its opposition 
        to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be 'fatally flawed', as 
        it would damage the US economy and it exempted developing countries from 
        fully participating (Coon 2001). This decision meant that the United States 
        - a major emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> -would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol would never have come into force if other developed 
        countries had adopted the same position. However, at the resumed 6th Conference 
        of the Parties (COP-6 Part II) in Bonn, Germany, in July 2001, the parties 
        (except the United States) successfully completed negotiations aimed at 
        setting the operational details for commitments on reducing emissions 
        of greenhouse gases. They also reached agreement on actions to strengthen 
        implementation of the UNFCCC itself. The political decision - or Bonn 
        Agreement - was formally adopted by the COP on 25 July 2001. Many saw 
        it as an 'historic' political agreement that saved the Kyoto Protocol 
        and paved the way to its ratification, though it was clearly recognized 
        that this was just a small step towards solving the global problem. Discussions 
        also resulted in a Political Declaration by the European Union, Canada, 
        Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland on funding for developing 
        countries. This Declaration includes an undertaking to provide an annual 
        contribution of US$410 million by 2005 (IISD 2001a).</p>
      <p>Shortly after COP-6 Part II, the climate change negotiators in Marrakesh 
        (COP-7 held October- November 2001) finalized outstanding issues related 
        to the political deal concluded in Bonn such as a compliance system, the 
        'Kyoto mechanisms', accounting, reporting and review of information under 
        the Kyoto Protocol, and others (the so-called 'Marrakesh Accords'). The 
        agreement reached in Marrakesh not only allows for ratification of the 
        Kyoto Protocol in the near future but also will serve as the foundation 
        for a comprehensive, multilateral approach that will and must continue 
        beyond this Protocol (IISD 2001b).</p>
      <p>Meeting the Kyoto targets will be just a first step in coping with the 
        problem of climate change because it will have a marginal effect on the 
        greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. Even if, in the long term, 
        a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is achieved, 
        warming will continue for several decades, and sea levels will continue 
        to rise for centuries with serious consequences for millions of people 
        (IPCC 2001a, b). </p>
