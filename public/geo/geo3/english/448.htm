      <p><a name="fig271"></a>People and the environment are increasingly suffering 
        from the effects of natural disasters. There are a number of reasons for 
        this such as high population growth and density, migration and unplanned 
        urbanization, environmental degradation and possibly global climate change. 
        The sheer scope of the socioeconomic impacts of natural disasters has 
        brought about a shift in the political approach to dealing with the concept 
        of risk in modern societies.</p>
      <p>Comparing the past two decades, the number of people killed in natural 
        and non-natural disasters was higher in the 1980s (86 328 annually) than 
        in the 1990s (75 252 annually). However, more people were affected by 
        disasters in the 1990s - up from an average of 147 million a year in the 
        1980s to 211 million people a year in the 1990s. While the number of geophysical 
        disasters has remained fairly steady, the number of hydrometeorological 
        disasters (those caused by water and weather) has increased (see figure). 
        In the 1990s, more than 90 per cent of those killed in natural disasters 
        lost their lives in hydrometeorological events such as droughts, windstorms 
        and floods. While floods accounted for more than two-thirds of people 
        affected by natural disasters, they are less deadly than many other types 
        of disaster, accounting for only 15 per cent of deaths (IFRC 2001). </p>
      <p>The social and economic costs of disasters vary widely and are difficult 
        to estimate on a global basis. Insurance claims tend to be misleading 
        as an estimate of the economic impact of disasters. Considering insured 
        damage claims for the 1999 floods in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 
        at least 42.5 per cent of damage was covered by disaster insurance. But 
        in Venezuela the same year, only 4 per cent of flood damage was covered 
        (CRED-OFDA 2002). There is a need for reliable and systematic data on 
        disasters to help assess their socio-economic and environmental impacts 
        in both the short and the long term. But although communities in developing 
        countries suffer from numerous local-scale disasters such as wildfires, 
        small floods, droughts and pest infestations, these are often not reflected 
        in disaster statistics.</p>

      <p><a name="fig272"></a>The most expensive disasters in purely financial 
        and economic terms are floods, earthquakes and windstorms but events such 
        as drought and famine can be more devastating in human terms. While earthquakes 
        accounted for 30 per cent of estimated damage, they caused just 9 per 
        cent of all fatalities due to natural disasters. In contrast, famine killed 
        42 per cent, but accounted for just 4 per cent of damage over the past 
        decade (IFRC 2001). In 1999, global financial losses from natural catastrophic 
        events were estimated to exceed US$100 billion - the second highest figure 
        on record. A total of 707 large events were recorded compared to 530 to 
        600 events in previous years. It is even more striking that the number 
        of major catastrophic events over the past decade has increased threefold 
        in comparison with the 1960s, while the rate of economic losses has increased 
        by a factor of almost nine over the same period (Munich Re 2001).</p>
      <p>Between 1995 and 1997, the impacts of natural hazards cost the United 
        States at least US$50 billion a year, or the equivalent of about US$1 
        billion a week (IDNDR 1999a). The economic losses of the United States 
        because of the 1997-98 El Niño event were estimated at US$1.96 billion 
        or 0.03 per cent of GDP. Ecuador suffered equivalent financial losses 
        but this represented 11.4 per cent of its GDP. The floods in China in 
        1991, 1994-95 and 1998 caused losses ranging from US$20 to 35 billion 
        (CNC-IDNDR 1999). The annual loss from natural disasters over the period 
        from 1989 to 1996 is estimated to range from 3 to 6 per cent of China's 
        GDP, averaging 3.9 per cent. In December 1999, the Anatol, Lothar and 
        Martin storms generated losses in northern Europe amounting to US$5-6 
        billion (Munich Re 2001). Less developed countries with limited economic 
        diversity and poor infrastructure must not only rely mostly on external 
        relief if a disaster happens but their economies need more time to recover. 
        In developed economies, governments, communities and individuals have 
        greater capacities to cope with disasters, the economic losses are to 
        some extent absorbed by a diversified economy, and most assets are insured.</p>

      <p>Among the least developed countries, 24 of the 49 face high levels of 
        disaster risk; at least six of them have been affected by between two 
        and eight major disasters per year in the past 15 years, with long-term 
        consequences for human development (UNDP 2001). Since 1991, more than 
        half of all the disasters reported occurred in countries with medium levels 
        of human development (see <a href="082.htm">'Socio-economic background'</a>). 
        However, two-thirds of those killed came from countries with low levels 
        of human development, while just 2 per cent came from highly developed 
        countries. The effect of development on disasters is dramatic: on average, 
        22.5 people die per reported disaster in highly developed countries, 145 
        die per disaster in countries with medium human development, and 1 052 
        people die per disaster in countries with low levels of development (IFRC 
        2001).</p>
      <p>A number of experts link the current trend in extreme weather events 
        with an increase of the global mean temperature. Many parts of the world 
        have suffered major heat waves, floods, droughts and other extreme weather 
        events. While individual events, such as El Niño-related phenomena (see 
        box below), cannot be directly linked to human-induced climate change, 
        the frequency and magnitude of these types of events are predicted to 
        increase in a warmer world. The changes in the global mean temperature 
        are 'very likely' to affect parameters such as precipitation patterns, 
        wind velocities, soil moisture and vegetation cover which appear to influence 
        the occurrence of storms, hurricanes, floods, drought and landslides (IPCC 
        2001). For example, the extent of damage from storm surges can be directly 
        linked to sea level variations. </p>

      <p>Climate change and variability alone do not explain the increase in the 
        impacts related to disasters. 'Natural' can be a misleading description 
        for disasters such as the droughts, floods and cyclones which afflict 
        much of the developing world. Identifying humaninduced root causes, and 
        advocating structural and political changes to combat them, is long overdue 
        (IFRC 2001). For example, destruction of the natural environment because 
        of logging or inappropriate land uses for short-term economic gain is 
        one of the major factors promoting floods or mudslides such as those that 
        hit Venezuela in December 1999. Similarly, the migration of population 
        to urban and coastal areas increases human vulnerability as population 
        densities increase, infrastructure becomes overloaded, living areas move 
        closer to potentially dangerous industries, and more settlements are built 
        in fragile areas such floodplains or areas prone to landslides. As a result, 
        natural catastrophes affect more people and economic losses are increased. 
        For example, despite the fact that seismic activity has remained constant 
        over recent years, the effects of earthquakes on the urban population 
        appear to be increasing.</p>
