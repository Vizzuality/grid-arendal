      <p><span class="bigchar">T</span>he third UNEP Global Environment Outlook 
        report (<i>GEO-3</i>) provides an opportune brief for the 2002 World Summit 
        on Sustainable Development (WSSD), to be held later this year in Johannesburg, 
        South Africa.</p>
      <p>It is a feat of collaboration between UNEP and some 1 000 individuals 
        and 40 institutions from around the world. It picks up and weaves together 
        the strands of debate and action on the environment that lead forward 
        from that linchpin of modern environment and development thinking, the 
        1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, and through the 1992 
        United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) to where 
        we stand today. <i>GEO-3</i> sets out to provide global and regional perspectives 
        on the past, present and future environment, linked together with telling 
        examples from within the regions to form a comprehensive and integrated 
        assessment.</p>
      <p>An important aspect of the GEO process is capacity building for the collaborating 
        centres directly involved in this initiative and for a wider range of 
        individuals and institutions whose work forms the foundation of environmental 
        assessment - from national through global levels. For example, UNEP has, 
        through a comprehensive Internet-based data portal, made relevant data 
        more accessible to collaborating centres to strengthen analysis and reporting. 
        Capacity building has also involved formal and practical training in integrated 
        environmental assessment, and such training will be expanded in the coming 
        years.</p>
      <p>In terms of the <i>GEO-3 </i>report itself, an overview of major developments 
        between 1972 and 2002 highlights significant milestones and integrates 
        environmental, economic and social factors within a unified world view. 
        The retrospective chapter explores many of these developments in greater 
        depth from global and regional standpoints. The report presents a global 
        overview and also directs a spotlight onto two or three key issues that 
        are considered paramount in each of the seven regional arenas under each 
        of eight environmental themes in turn: land, forests, biodiversity, freshwater, 
        coastal and marine areas, atmosphere, urban areas and disasters.</p>
      <p>Analysing the most up-to-date and reliable information on these issues 
        reveals the critical trends during the 30-year period - critical trends 
        about the environment, and about the impacts that environmental change 
        have had on people. Perhaps even more importantly, it highlights the evolution 
        of environmental policy responses that society has (or sometimes has not) 
        put in place to ensure environmental security and sustainability.</p>
      <p>Sustainable development rests on three pillars - society, economy and 
        environment. The environmental pillar provides the physical resources 
        and ecosystem services on which humankind depends. Growing evidence that 
        many aspects of the environment are still degrading leads us to the conclusion 
        that people are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental change. 
        Some countries can cope but many others remain at risk and when that risk 
        becomes a reality their dreams of sustainable development are set back 
        by decades. The notion of human vulnerability to environmental change 
        has been incorporated specifically into this GEO assessment to demonstrate 
        UNEP concern in an area which has a strong bearing on the success of sustainable 
        development. UNEP places the concept of human vulnerability to environmental 
        change high on its future programme of work.</p>
      <p><i>GEO-3 </i>also breaks new ground by using scenario analysis to explore 
        the environmental outlook, fastforwarding the reader into an array of 
        alternative futures that provide insight on where events could lead us 
        at various stages between 2002 and 2032. While some of the possible developments 
        may seem far removed from current circumstances, others have been predetermined 
        by the decisions and actions we have already taken. We know that some 
        of the policy approaches followed in the past have not lived up to expectations 
        and that institutional weaknesses have played an inevitable part in such 
        slippages. At the Rio +5 event in 1997, it became clear that progress 
        had fallen short of the goals set in 1992. Five years later the challenges 
        remain no less exacting. Yet we at UNEP remain convinced that it lies 
        well within the scope of human determination and ingenuity to come up 
        with appropriate policy packages and use them to ensure that fundamental 
        environmental conditions can and will get steadily better, not stealthily 
        worse.</p>
      <p>This report abounds with information that can serve as a firm foundation 
        for the WSSD review of policies for sustainable development. I hope many 
        will find it useful as an aid to prepare for the Summit, during the event 
        itself and well beyond. It is being published in all the official UN languages 
        so that people and communities round the world can make use of its insights 
        to form their own position on what is at stake and what needs to be done. 
        On a personal note, I hope that it will inspire you, the reader, to raise 
        your commitment to environmental care to a summit of its own.</p>
