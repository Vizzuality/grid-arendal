      <p>The turn of the 21st century was an opportunity to reflect on the past 
        and speculate about the future. This milestone not only heralded the beginning 
        of a new millennium but also marked more than 50 years of several key 
        global institutions, not least the United Nations and World Bank.</p>

      <p>Events at regional level also provide much food for thought. The countries 
        of the European Union (EU) face the possibility of membership nearly doubling 
        in one or two decades, spurred on by the end of the Cold War and the collapse 
        of the eastern bloc. In Africa, the relatively peaceful end of apartheid 
        in South Africa and the transition from military to civilian rule in Nigeria 
        have changed the political climate. These turnabouts in the continent's 
        two most populous countries open the door for new debate on how to solve 
        Africa's persistent problems, including civil wars, poverty, inequality 
        and the AIDS pandemic. Political changes in Asia and the Pacific, notably 
        in Indonesia and the Philippines, and the repercussions of the economic 
        crisis in the late 1990s are stimulating fresh dialogue about the future 
        of the region. In Latin America and the Caribbean, a period of relative 
        stability has prompted increased willingness to address important issues 
        inherited from the past. As they find themselves in the centre of some 
        of the most publicized geopolitical events, the people of West Asia eye 
        their future warily. Meanwhile, the recent economic slowdown and terrorist 
        attacks have led many North Americans to reassess their actions at home 
        and abroad to a degree not seen in decades.</p>
      <p>At this time, the world is marked by tumultuous change. A global system 
        seems to be taking shape as economic interdependence increases. Information 
        technology accelerates the spread of ideas and the human transformation 
        of nature becomes evident on a planetary scale. As economies grow, the 
        rich get richer and many of the poor manage to escape from poverty. But 
        huge disparities persist as vast wealth coexists with abject poverty and 
        each extreme generates its own characteristic environmental pressures.</p>
      <p>When sizing up prospects for the future, some find grounds for optimism 
        but others are more apprehensive. In spite of potentially powerful antiglobalization 
        forces, the optimists foresee the formation of a true global market and 
        relish the opportunities for greater efficiency and connectedness. The 
        pursuit of individual wealth on a global economic playing field made level 
        by universal governance mechanisms to reduce market barriers can, they 
        believe, open the way to a new age of affluence for all. If developing 
        country institutions can be adapted to benefit from the new technologies 
        and the emerging borderless economy, and if appropriate forms of global 
        governance can be created, the rising tide of global prosperity will lift 
        everyone to new heights of well-being.</p>
      <p>Sceptics, looking at the same phenomena, see riskier times ahead. They 
        point to wealth and power accumulating in just a few hands, especially 
        those of transnational corporations. They see unequal expansion of modern 
        production methods around the world, two-track development and stubbornly 
        onesided and manipulative approaches to global negotiations. The pessimists 
        fear the result will be erosion of trust between the North and the South 
        and between populations within both, ending up in a chronic inability 
        to forge credible, legitimate and enforceable agreements on sustainable 
        development. How, they wonder, can unbridled pursuit of economic growth 
        be kept within environmental limits? Will market-driven global development, 
        far from engendering a sense of participation in a common global society, 
        tend instead to continue to split humanity into privileged and excluded, 
        North and South, modernist and traditionalist factions? If the accelerated 
        transition to a global economy fails to give institutions time to adapt, 
        will community cohesion and democratic participation be sacrificed to 
        it?</p>

            and so help people and communities to afford to insure against - or 
            pay to fix - social and environmental problems. Ethical investors, 
            together with citizen and consumer groups, try to exercise growing 
            corrective influence but are undermined by economic imperatives. The

      <p>Many feel apprehensive, too, about the prospect that their children will 
        inherit an impoverished and fragile world that is ecologically, socially 
        and economically depleted. More fundamentally, some object to the encouragement 
        of traits and lifestyles founded on individualism and greed, which they 
        see emerging from this global consumer culture. Several important initiatives 
        pave the way for the major developments in the new century. The Doha round 
        of negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO) - including 
        its newest member, China - provides the legal basis for an expanded global 
        trading system. Significantly, it has written into it a recognition that 
        this system must take into account important social and environmental 
        concerns, in addition to the core economic goals. A multilateral agreement 
        on investment liberalizes investment regimes first in Organization for 
        Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, with expectations 
        that this will follow shortly throughout the world. The coalition against 
        terrorism paves the way for new approaches to international security.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, efforts continue to salvage the climate negotiations, to build 
        upon multilateral environmental agreements in other areas and to address 
        important social issues. Much of this effort initially hinges on international 
        activities, particularly the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) 
        and follow-up activities, which galvanize a renewed commitment to action.</p>
      <p>This commitment revolves around a mixture of old and new initiatives 
        designed to gain a better understanding of the issues that cause concern 
        and to tackle them more effectively. Goals and targets related to basic 
        needs (food security, access to clean water, sanitation, literacy and 
        life expectancy) and environmental conditions (urban air quality, availability 
        of fresh water, resource use, waste disposal and habitat/species preservation) 
        are reiterated. A commitment is also made to strengthen international 
        institutions of governance.</p>
