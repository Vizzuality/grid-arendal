      <p><a name="fig67"></a>Urban areas occupy only 1 per cent of the Earth's 
        land area (UNEP 2000). However, urban expansion, including land requirements 
        for industry, transport and for leisure activities in all regions, increases 
        pressures on land resources. In the United States, for example, about 
        400 000 ha of farmland are lost to urbanization annually and China lost 
        about 5 million ha of farmland to towns and cities during 1987-92 (UNFPA 
        2001). Land degradation, river siltation and soil pollution, from acid 
        rain and industrial wastes, are some of the environmental issues associated 
        with urbanization and industrialization.</p>
      <p>The waste generated by cities is a major source of degradation. It is 
        estimated that about 1.95 million ha of land have been degraded by industry 
        and urbanization (FAO 1996). One cause has been the export by some developed 
        countries of hazardous and toxic wastes to developing regions.</p>
      <p>The international response to this was the 1989 Basel Convention on the 
        Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. 
        The Basel Convention, which entered into force in 1992 (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 
        1</a>), aims to reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, minimize 
        the creation of such wastes, and prohibit their shipment to countries 
        lacking the capacity to dispose of hazardous wastes in an environmentally 
        sound manner.</p>
      <p>Urbanization has also spawned urban agriculture (see '<a href="401.htm">Urban 
        areas</a>'), which was hardly recognized internationally in the 1970s 
        but has been expanding globally over the past 15-20 years, 'more rapidly 
        than urban populations, and in many countries more rapidly than their 
        economies' (Smit 1996). Urban agriculture takes place on both public and 
        private land, both legally and illegally. More than 800 million urban 
        dwellers were involved in urban agriculture in 1993 (Smit 1996). For example, 
        in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, agriculture is a major planned land 
        use in the city's metropolitan master plan, which was adopted in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>In virtually all regions, urban agriculture has become one of the major 
        food-producing activities. For example, most households in the Southeast 
        Asia and Pacific Island sub-regions practise urban agriculture (Sommers 
        and Smit 1994). About 30 per cent of the Russian Federation's food is 
        produced on 3 per cent of the land in suburban dachas (Sommers and Smit 
        1994). In Moscow, families engaged in agriculture grew from 20 per cent 
        of the city's population in 1970 to 65 per cent in 1990 (Smit 1996). During 
        1980-90, urban agriculture in the United States grew by 17 per cent (Smit 
        1996). In some African urban areas, the response by municipal authorities 
        has been to cut down the crops to enforce land-use by-laws.<br clear="all">

              <li>UNEP, together with FAO and WHO, is promoting more sustainable 
                practices in replacing POP pesticides with integrated pest management. 
                The Global Crop Protection Federation is playing a proactive role 
                in promoting the judicious use of pesticides and the prevention 
                of toxic exposures and misuse of pesticides.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other actions include pilot projects to demonstrate the technical 
              and economic feasibility of new technologies to destroy obsolete 
              chemicals and pesticides; and the encouragement of donors and industry 
              to increase funding for management and disposal of these substances.</p>

      <p>The impacts of urban agriculture include air, water and soil pollution, 
        mainly from improper use of chemicals. Advocates of urban agriculture 
        argue that, in addition to providing food, the activity can contribute 
        to improving the environment through recycling organic matter. Solid wastes 
        can be composted and used to fertilize soils.</p>

            <p>In Harare, Zimbabwe, sanctions on urban agriculture were lifted 
              temporarily in 1992. Within two years, the area cultivated had doubled 
              and the number of farmers more than doubled. Municipal costs for 
              landscape maintenance and waste management were down, food prices 
              were down, and hundreds of jobs had been created. Several benefits 
              were gained from just a change in policy. Similar policyrelated 
              benefits were documented in Lusaka and Accra in the 1970s (Smit 
              1996).</p>
