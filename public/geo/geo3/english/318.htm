      <a name="fig185"></a>The rapid global warming caused by human-induced changes 
      in the atmosphere that is projected by the IPCC would have dramatic effects 
      on the ocean (IPCC 2001), threatening valuable coastal ecosystems and the 
      economic sectors that depend upon them. Other potential impacts are complex 
      and poorly understood. Polar warming, and melting of the ice caps, could 
      slow down the global atmosphere/ocean 'heat engine', potentially altering 
      the flow of major ocean currents (Broecker 1997). The warming of the ocean's 
      surface layers, and an increased input of fresh water, could reduce the 
      upwelling of nutrients that supports much of the ocean's productivity. On 
      the other hand, the highly productive upwelling on the eastern side of some 
      oceans could intensify if, as some projections predict, relatively greater 
      warming occurs there (Bakun 1996). The IPCC predicts that storms and other 
      extreme weather events will increase in frequency and intensity (IPCC 2001), 
      increasing natural disturbances to coastal ecosystems and perhaps reducing 
      their ability to recover. 
      <p>There is particular concern about the possible effects of global warming 
        on coral reefs. During the intense El Niño of 1997-98, extensive coral 
        bleaching occurred on coral reefs worldwide (Wilkinson 1998, Wilkinson 
        and others 1999). While some reefs quickly recovered, others, particularly 
        in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and the far western Pacific, suffered 
        significant mortality, in some cases more than 90 per cent (Wilkinson 
        1998, 2000).</p>
      Some models predict a long-term shift to an increased frequency and intensity 
      of El Niño events or similar conditions. If this occurs, bleaching could 
      also become more frequent and intense, with irreversible damage to reefs. 
      There is evidence that a long-term decline of reefs in the remote Chagos 
      archipelago in the Indian Ocean is related both to El Niño events and to 
      a long-term rise in surface temperature (Sheppard 1999). Mass bleaching 
      of reefs in various parts of the world was also observed in 2000, a possible 
      sign that bleaching is becoming more frequent. Reefs may also be threatened 
      by a higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater which impairs the 
      deposition of their limestone skeletons. 
      <p>Proposed protection measures to address a sealevel rise caused by climate 
        change have shifted away from solid constructions such as seawalls in 
        favour of a mix of soft protection measures (such as beach nourishment 
        and wetland creation), adaptive planning (such as new building codes), 
        and managed retreat, including cessation of new coastal construction (IPCC 
        2001). Some proposals to address global climate change are themselves 
        a cause for concern, particularly those to short-circuit the natural transfer 
        of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to the ocean by fertilizing large 
        areas of the ocean surface with nitrogen or iron to enhance phytoplankton 
        growth, or to inject CO<sub>2</sub> directly into deep waters. The effects 
        of these large-scale measures cannot be predicted but are potentially 
        enormous.</p>
      <p>Small island developing states (SIDS) and lowlying coastal areas are 
        particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels and more extreme 
        weather. Furthermore, they are essentially entirely coastal and therefore 
        more dependent upon coastal and marine resources. Recognition of this 
        special vulnerability in Agenda 21 of the UN Conference on Environment 
        and Development (UNCED) led to the adoption in 1994 of the Barbados Programme 
        of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States.</p>

            <p>The effect of a jellyfish invasion on the Black Sea is one of the 
              best documented examples of the far reaching economic and ecological 
              consequences that can follow the introduction of an alien species 
              into an environment favouring its almost unlimited expansion.</p>
            <p><i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>, a comb jellyfish, originates on the eastern 
              seaboards of both North and South America. It abounds in ports and 
              harbours, and is pumped in ballast water into cargo ships. These 
              jellyfish can live for 3-4 weeks without food, by reducing the size 
              of their bodies, so they can easily survive the 20-day voyage to 
              the Black Sea. They were first found in the Black Sea, off the south-east 
              Crimea, in 1982.</p>
            <p>Damaging human activities - including overfishing, pollution, water 
              extraction and barrages on rivers running into the sea - had set 
              the stage for its entrance. Overfishing and eutrophication seem 
              to have combined to remove top predators such as turbot, bluefish 
              and monk seals and to cut the numbers of plankton-eating fish severely, 
              opening up a niche for the jellyfish. Meanwhile plankton proliferated.</p>
            <p>Hermaphroditic and self-fertilizing, the numbers of jellyfish exploded 
              from 1988 onwards. The populations of plankton crashed as the invaders 
              ate them. Fish stocks collapsed, partly because the jellyfish deprived 
              them of their food and ate their eggs and larvae. The catch of the 
              former states of the Soviet Union plummeted from 250 000 to 30 000 
              tonnes a year, and it was much the same story in Turkey. At least 
              US$300 million was lost in falling fishery revenues between the 
              mid-1980s and the early 1990s, with grave economic and social consequences. 
              Fishing vessels were put up for sale, and fishermen abandoned the 
              sea. </p>
