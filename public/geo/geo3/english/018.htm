      <p>Acid precipitation has been one of the most prominent environmental concerns 
        over the past decades, especially in Europe and North America, and more 
        recently also in China. Thousands of lakes in Scandinavia lost fish populations 
        due to acidification from the 1950s to the 1980s. Significant damage to 
        forests in Europe became a high priority environmental issue around 1980. 
        Air pollutant emissions have declined or stabilized in most industrialized 
        countries, largely as a result of abatement policies developed and implemented 
        since the 1970s. Initially, governments tried to apply direct control 
        instruments but these were not always costeffective. In the 1980s, policies 
        were directed more towards pollution abatement mechanisms that relied 
        on a compromise between the cost of environmental protection measures 
        and economic growth. Stricter environmental regulation in industrialized 
        countries has triggered the introduction of cleaner technology and technological 
        improvements, especially in the power generation and transport sectors.</p>
      <p>Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
        one of the major greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere has increased significantly, 
        contributing to the greenhouse effect known as 'global warming'. The increase 
        is largely due to anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil 
        fuel combustion and to a lesser extent land-use change, cement production 
        and biomass combustion. Greenhouse gas emissions are unevenly distributed 
        between countries and regions. Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
        Development (OECD) countries contributed more than half of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions in 1998, with a per capita emission of about three times the 
        world average. However, the OECD's share of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        has decreased by 11 per cent since 1973. Climate change represents an 
        important additional stress on those ecosystems already affected by increasing 
        resource demands, unsustainable management practices and pollution. The 
        United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol 
        are the key policy instruments adopted by the international community 
        to try to address the problem of greenhouse gases emissions.</p>
      <p>The protection of the ozone layer has presented one of the major challenges 
        over the past 30 years, spanning the fields of environment, trade, industry, 
        international cooperation and sustainable development. The depletion of 
        the ozone layer has now reached record levels, especially in the Antarctic 
        and recently also in the Arctic. In September 2000, the Antarctic ozone 
        hole covered more than 28 million km<sup>3</sup>. Continuous efforts by 
        the international community have resulted in a marked decrease in the 
        consumption of ozone-depleting substances. The ozone layer is predicted 
        to start recovering in the next one or two decades and to return to pre-1980 
        levels by the middle of the 21st century- if the control measures of the 
        protocols to the Vienna Convention are adhered to by all countries.</p>

          <td>North America is a major consumer of the world's natural resources 
            and producer of its wastes, and its per capita impact on the global 
            environment is larger than that of any other region. Resource conservation 
            in North America has been less successful than pollution abatement, 
            and per capita consumption has increased steadily since 1972. There 
            has been significant progress in controlling some forms of air and 
            water pollution and in continuing a trend to set aside protected areas. 
            During the 1990s, North American free trade strengthened the economic 
            ties between Canada and the United States. At the same time, regional 
            environmental degradation led to an increased recognition of the interdependent 
            nature of cross-border ecosystems. The two countries strengthened 
            cooperative measures to address transboundary pollution, agreeing 
            to more aggressive NO<sub>x</sub> emission controls, for example. 
            They also undertook to conserve the continent's wetland habitats to 
            protect waterfowl and other migratory species. The impact of introduced 
            exotic species on biological diversity became of increasing environmental 
            concern with the liberalization of trade.</td>

          <td>The major environmental issues in the polar regions include the 
            depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, the long-range transport 
            of air pollutants, warming associated with global climate change, 
            the decline of several bird, mammal and fish species, and pollution 
            of major rivers. In the Arctic, average yearly ozone levels in the 
            1990s had declined by 10 per cent from the late 1970s, increasing 
            the risk of snow blindness and sunburn. Climate change is expected 
            to be more extreme in the polar regions than anywhere else. Human 
            activities are major threats to biodiversity in the Arctic. The warming 
            trend is reducing the ice habitat for species such as the polar bear 
            and walrus. In the Antarctic, sealing and whaling have reduced populations 
            in the Southern Ocean. Eutrophication is a recent problem in several 
            lakes in Scandinavia. One of the major developments in the Arctic 
            is public opposition to dam construction, particularly in the Nordic 
            countries. For example, in 2001 Iceland's National Planning Agency 
            rejected plans for a hydroelectric power project that would have dammed 
            two of the three main rivers flowing from Europe's largest glacier 
            and destroyed an extensive wilderness.</td>
