      <p>The world of 1972 was very different from that of today. The Cold War 
        still divided many of the world's most industrialized nations, the period 
        of colonization had not yet ended and, although e-mail had just been invented 
        (Campbell 1998), it was to be more than two decades before its use became 
        widespread. The personal computer did not exist, global warming had only 
        just been mentioned for the first time (SCEP 1970), and the threat to 
        the ozone layer was seen as coming mainly from a large fleet of supersonic 
        airliners that was never to materialize. Although transnational corporations 
        existed and were becoming increasingly powerful, the concept of globalization 
        was still 20 years away. In South Africa, apartheid still held sway and 
        in Europe the Berlin Wall stood firm. </p>

      <p>The world of the early 1970s was thus fiercely polarized, and in many 
        different ways. Against this backdrop, it was surprising that the idea 
        of an international conference on the environment should even be broached 
        (by Sweden, in 1968); it was even more surprising that one should actually 
        take place (in Stockholm, in 1972); and it was astonishing that such a 
        conference could give rise to what later became known as the 'Stockholm 
        spirit of compromise' in which representatives of developed and developing 
        countries found ways of accommodating each other's strongly divergent 
        views. The conference was hosted by Sweden following severe damage to 
        thousands of Sweden's lakes from acid rain falling as a result of severe 
        air pollution in Western Europe.</p>
