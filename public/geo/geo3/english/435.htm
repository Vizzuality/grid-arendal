      <p>The majority of the West Asian population lives in urban areas, with 
        the notable exception of Yemen, where the predominantly rural population 
        is expected to grow by 2.7 per cent between 2000 and 2015 (UNCHS 2001). 
        The past 30 years have brought about significant economic, political and 
        technological changes, which have influenced the way urban areas are structured 
        and function in West Asia. Three crucial factors have shaped the urban 
        landscapes of the region (UNESCWA 1999):</p>
      <ul class="westasia">
        <li>the 1970s oil boom and the sharp fluctuations of oil revenues during 
          the following two decades;</li>
        <li>the large-scale movement of people within the region because of armed 
          conflict and civil strife; and</li>
        <li>the forces of globalization that have played and continue to play 
          a vital role since the beginning of the early 1990s, integrating West 
          Asian nations into the global economy and increasing the role of information 
          technology. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rapid economic growth, which occurred in most countries in the region 
        over the past three decades, was accompanied by population growth and 
        increased urbanization. There has been a massive migration of the population 
        from rural to urban areas in nearly all countries as well as immigration 
        of foreign workers into urban areas, especially in the Gulf Cooperation 
        Council (GCC) countries. Between 1972 and 1980, the total urban population 
        increased from 17.8 million (44.7 per cent of the total population) to 
        27 million (55.8 per cent of the total population). The average annual 
        growth rate of the urban population in this period was 5.6 per cent, substantially 
        more than that of the general population, which was 3.6 per cent. Urbanization 
        has continued to increase at a faster rate than the total population (United 
        Nations Population Division 2001a) although there are marked differences 
        in the level and pace of urbanization between the subregions and among 
        the countries of the region.</p>
      <p>Spectacular growth and urban transition occurred in Oman, where the urban 
        population increased from 11.4 per cent of the total population in 1970, 
        to 84 per cent by 2000. All the countries of the Arabian Peninsula now 
        have a level of urbanization above 84 per cent, except Yemen with a level 
        of urbanization of only 24.7 per cent (see map). By the year 2000, almost 
        the entire population of Bahrain (92.2 per cent), Kuwait (97.6 per cent) 
        and Qatar (92.5) were living in urban areas (United Nations Population 
        Division 2001a).</p>
      <p>The average annual growth rate of urban populations in West Asia has 
        slowed over the past three decades, from 6.1 per cent in 1972 to 3.7 per 
        cent in 2000. The impact of the Second Gulf War on urbanization rates 
        was particularly significant, resulting in the repatriation of millions 
        of foreign workers.</p>

      <p><a name="fig264"></a>Although urban areas are increasingly home to most 
        of the West Asian population, the proportion of people living in cities 
        with more than 1 million residents is still small. In 1975, only two cities 
        (Baghdad and Damascus) had a total population of more than 1 million, 
        accounting for a quarter of the total urban population of the region. 
        The number of large cities has doubled every ten years, reaching 12 in 
        the year 2000, but their population as a share of the total urban population 
        has still remained between 25 and 37 per cent. The absolute number of 
        people living in these cities, however, increased from 3.88 million to 
        23.8 million between 1975 and 2000.</p>
      <p>Urbanization is inextricably linked with the economic transition that 
        is taking place in the region from agrarian and nomadic societies to one 
        that is based on manufacturing and services. Economic development has 
        brought dramatic improvement in the well-being of the West Asian people 
        including longer life expectancies, higher incomes and decreased child 
        mortality rates (United Nations Population Division 2001b). However, despite 
        these positive impacts, many cities are now going through a transition 
        process marked by some negative influences. In parts of the region (Mashriq), 
        the pace and scale of change often strains the capabilities of national 
        and local governments to provide adequate services to the urban poor. 
        In such situations, human health and well-being are at risk (UNDP, UNEP, 
        World Bank and WRI 1998). Growth of urban populations is also synonymous 
        with growth in urban poverty. Most of the large cities are crowded and 
        have high levels of air pollution from increasing traffic, energy consumption 
        and industrial production.</p>
