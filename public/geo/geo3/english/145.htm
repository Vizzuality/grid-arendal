    <td class="contentText" valign="top"><!-- #BeginEditable "MainContent" -->The 
      increase in world population means that pressures on land will continue 
      to be acute, particularly in Africa and Asia. The increased needs for food 
      and other agricultural products must be met mainly by raising and sustaining 
      crop and livestock yields and by more intensive land use. This has to be 
      accompanied by more efficient harvesting and processing of products so as 
      to reduce post-production losses. However, current projections also assume 
      an expansion of the arable area in developing countries, although at half 
      the rate of the previous 30 years (FAO 2001). By 2030, FAO estimates suggest 
      that an additional 57 million ha will be brought into cultivation in Africa, 
      and 41 million ha in Latin America, increases of 25 per cent and 20 per 
      cent respectively (FAO 2001). This expansion must necessarily come either 
      from further conversion of forest and woodland, or by bringing into cultivation 
      fragile areas of the semi-arid zone, both of which raise serious environmental 
      concerns. 
      <p>Meeting these challenges will stretch the limited resources currently 
        allocated to agricultural research and development, and may call for reallocation 
        of the scarce funding available. It will, in addition, require good governance, 
        land and soil policies, and continued efforts to achieve sustainable use 
        of land resources. A prerequisite is the adequate support by governments 
        for national land resource institutions, and for building up the capacities 
        of land resource planners, farmers and managers at local and national 
        levels. Maintenance or improvement of the productive potential of land 
        resources to meet the needs of present and future populations, while at 
        the same time sustaining the vital ecosystem functions and other multiple 
        uses of land, is a fundamental requirement for sustainability. </p>

            <p><a name="fig68"></a>Mountains can provide crucial resources for 
              social and economic development. Mountain commons provide essential 
              local and downstream environmental products and services such as 
              freshwater supplies, irrigation, hydropower, flood control, biodiversity 
              conservation and tourism. However, with few exceptions, mountain 
              commons are ecologically under-managed and suffer from the classic 
              'commons syndrome': while all seek to benefit, stakeholders lack 
              coordination, incentives and instruments for joint care.</p>
            <p>Satellite imagery shows significant loss of mountain forests and 
              other vegetative cover over the past 20 years. The causes are often 
              inappropriate agriculture and livestock developments in fragile 
              areas. Downstream, poor watershed management causes siltation of 
              rivers and reservoirs, and allows natural disasters to take an unprecedented 
              toll as roads, bridges and sometimes entire communities are washed 
              away.</p>
            <p>Whenever mountain ecosystems are degraded by overexploitation, 
              costs to businesses and communities are high. As vegetation is removed, 
              aquifers and wells run drier. Siltation reduces the sustainability 
              of hydropower and irrigation reservoirs. Agricultural run-off spoils 
              the purity of renewable sources of freshwater. Fisheries suffer 
              and urban water supplies dwindle in the dry season. In deforested 
              mountain ranges, floods may become uncontrollable after heavy rain. 
              They cause global damage of tens of billions of dollars every year.</p>
            <p>Businesses stand to benefit from joining hands, and from shaping 
              common action programmes to safeguard mountain ecosystems. This 
              is a longterm challenge, and will require a measure of social responsibility 
              and commitment beyond customary business horizons. Local, long-term, 
              strategic private-public partnerships could begin to address and 
              reverse patterns of degradation. In the same way that water-user 
              associations are necessary in downstream water and irrigation management, 
              there is a need for mountainstakeholder associations. Region-by-region, 
              these would need to equip themselves with supporting institutional, 
              legal, economic and monitoring instruments.</p>
            <p>The International Year of Mountains 2002 (IYM) could inspire such 
              processes: it can draw attention to issues and opportunities; it 
              can help network stakeholders across sectoral and company boundaries, 
              it can promote conducive policy and incentive instruments. The business 
              community could now build on recent work under the global water 
              partnership agenda. The Water and Mountain Commons agenda, developed 
              jointly by the Earth3000 NGO and UNEP's Mountain Programme, could 
              become a tangible contribution to IYM. During the Bishkek Global 
              Mountain Summit, the main concluding event of IYM, a special Mountain 
              Marketplace facility will be established to promote private-public 
              partnerships and mountain stakeholders' associations, involving 
              upstream and downstream communities.</p>
