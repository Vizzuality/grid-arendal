      <p>Pollution has considerably degraded the coastal and marine environment, 
        including estuaries, of the region over the past 30 years. Increased wastes 
        from landbased urban, industrial and agricultural activities as well as 
        from offshore oil and gas exploitation are discharged untreated in the 
        coastal region (MoSTE Viet Nam 1999).</p>
      The most significant sources of pollution include oil from ships, sewage 
      and other domestic wastes, and industrial effluents. The main route of marine 
      transport of oil from the Gulf is across the Arabian Sea, and accidental 
      oil spills have been frequently reported along oil transport routes, at 
      points of discharge and loading of oil carriers. The shipping of oil coupled 
      with increasing emphasis on offshore oil exploration makes the northern 
      Indian Ocean extremely vulnerable to oil pollution. Oil spills also cause 
      severe pollution in ports in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan 
      (DoE Malaysia 1996, 1998). In addition, the cleaning of oil tanks in and 
      around ports has led to the frequent formation of tar-balls on the southwestern 
      beaches of Sri Lanka. In the PICs, marine pollution from ships is a threat 
      that is likely to increase as trade and economies develop further. 
      <p>The enhanced use of agrochemicals on land and discharge of chemicals 
        into seawater is a common problem. An estimated 1 800 tonnes of pesticides 
        enter the Bay of Bengal every year (Holmgrem 1994). In the Sea of Japan, 
        a survey has revealed high concentrations of mercury, the source of which 
        could have been wastewater from chemical plants (MSA 1997), while the 
        Russian Federation admitted in 1993 that the former Soviet Union had dumped 
        nuclear wastes there 'for decades' (Hayes and Zarsky 1993). In spite of 
        international regulations, marine pollution in the Sea of Japan and the 
        Yellow Sea has continued to worsen.</p>
      <p>Tourism and other recreational activities also pose a threat to coastal 
        ecosystems in many countries. The construction of tourism infrastructure 
        has both a direct and indirect adverse impact on coastal environments 
        through infilling, dredging and resuspension of contaminated silts, discharge 
        of untreated or partially treated sewage, operational leaks, and discharge 
        of hydrocarbons and waste dumping. Sand dunes, an important component 
        of coastal ecosystems in the region, have also been eroded as a result 
        of tourism activities.</p>
      <p>Sediment load in the coastal zones of South Asia is high, mainly as a 
        result of soil erosion caused by poor land-use practices and construction 
        activities. Annually, about 1.6 billion tonnes of sediment reach the Indian 
        Ocean from rivers flowing from the Indian sub-continent. The total sediment 
        load of the river system of Bangladesh alone amounts to about 2.5 billion 
        tonnes, of which the Brahmaputra carries 1.7 billion tonnes and the Ganges 
        0.8 billion tonnes (UNEP 1987). Coastal erosion is severe in many areas 
        including the Andaman coast, the Gulf of Thailand, Japan and the PICs.</p>

            <p>The annual discharge of ballast water in Australian coastal waters 
              is about 150 million tonnes from international vessels and 34 million 
              tonnes from coastal vessels. A major incursion of black-striped 
              mussels in Darwin Harbour in early 1999 prompted the establishment 
              of a National Task Force on the Prevention and Management of Marine 
              Pest Incursions. A major recommendation of the task force was the 
              establishment of a single national management regime for vessels. 
              Its recommendations are implemented through the National Introduced 
              Marine Pests Coordination Group which was established under the 
              Ministerial councils for environment, fisheries and aquaculture, 
              and transport. The Consultative Committee on Introduced Marine Pest 
              Emergencies, a mechanism for emergency responses to introduced marine 
              pests, was introduced in 2000.</p>
            <p>Since 1990 the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) 
              has adopted voluntary guidelines and measures to manage ballast 
              water. In July 2001, Australia introduced mandatory ballast water 
              management for international vessels entering its waters. Vessels 
              are assessed by AQIS: high risk vessels are required to fully exchange 
              ballast water at sea, while low risk vessels are allowed to exchange 
              within coastal waters. </p>
