      <p>Economic development encompasses many factors, including production, 
        finance and the distribution of resources both between regions and across 
        sectors of society. Although the pattern varies conspicuously, there has 
        been a general trend towards more servicebased economies. Product, financial 
        and even labour markets are becoming increasingly integrated and interconnected 
        in a worldwide economy with global commodity chains and financial markets. 
        Similar trends are appearing at a regional level in several parts of the 
        globe. These processes have been spurred on by advances in information 
        technology, international pacts designed to remove trade barriers or liberalize 
        investment flows and the progressive deregulation of national economies. 
        The same advances have also allowed wealth produced by national and transnational 
        mergers to become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. There has also 
        been an increase in inequality in terms of income and resource use across 
        - and often within - nations. For many nations the problem of inequality 
        is made worse by debt burdens that seriously constrain growth. As transnational 
        enterprises respond to global business opportunities, the traditional 
        prerogatives of the nation-state and the capacity for macro-economic intervention 
        by the state are challenged anew.</p>

      <p>In <i>Markets First</i>, it is assumed that most of the trends noted 
        above persist, if not accelerate. Economic development outweighs social 
        and environmental concerns in most international discussions. Resistance 
        continues but no radical changes in policy result. Recognition that maintenance 
        of environmental and social conditions is important for ensuring economic 
        development slows economic growth down over time, but not very noticeably.</p>
      <p>In <i>Security First</i>, trends towards global integration continue 
        for some parts of the economy, yet come to a halt or even go into reverse 
        for others. Over time, more and more activity takes place in the grey 
        or underground economy.</p>
      <p>Integration trends persist in <i>Policy First</i> and <i>Sustainability 
        First</i> but they are tempered by the introduction of new policies and 
        institutions to tackle social and environmental concerns. This reflects 
        improved understanding of the crucial roles of human, social and natural 
        capital in determining economic health. Changes in attitudes and behaviour 
        in <i>Sustainability First</i> affect these trends more than in the other 
        scenarios as the whole notion of economic development becomes increasingly 
        subsumed in the broader concept of human development.</p>
      <p>The effect of these changes on per capita income varies strongly across 
        regions and scenarios. Average income growth in all regions is lowest 
        in<i> Security First </i>but also very unevenly distributed due to the 
        greater inequality within regions. In the other scenarios, average growth 
        at the global level is similar but there are key differences between and 
        within regions. In <i>Policy First</i>, the more equable distribution 
        of growth makes average incomes of the wealthy grow slightly slower than 
        in <i>Markets First</i>, whereas incomes rise more rapidly among the poor. 
        The most dramatic increases in income growth are seen in Africa, but also 
        in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and 
        West Asia. The convergence in per capita incomes is even greater in <i>Sustainability 
        First</i>, especially as wealthier persons shift their emphasis away from 
        marketoriented production and consumption. However, large differences 
        remain at the end of the 30-year period.</p>
