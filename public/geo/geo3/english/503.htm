      <p>Human health is increasingly determined by environmental conditions (Rapport 
        and others 1999, McMichael 2001). According to a report from the World 
        Health Organization (WHO 1997), for example:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>Deteriorating environmental conditions are a major contributory factor 
          to poor health and poor quality of life. Mismanagement of natural resources, 
          excessive waste production and associated environmental conditions that 
          affect health pose major challenges to sustainable development.</li>
        <li>Impoverished populations living in rural and periurban areas are at 
          greatest risk from degraded environmental conditions. The cumulative 
          effects of inadequate and hazardous shelter, overcrowding, lack of water 
          supply and sanitation, unsafe food, air and water pollution, and high 
          accident rates, have serious effects on the health of these vulnerable 
          groups.</li>
        <li>Poor environmental quality is directly responsible for some 25 per 
          cent of all preventable ill health, with diarrhoeal diseases and acute 
          respiratory infections heading the list.</li>
        <li>Two-thirds of all preventable ill health due to environmental conditions 
          occurs among children.</li>
        <li>Air pollution is a major contributor to a number of diseases, and 
          to a lowering of the quality of life in general.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are regional differences in the way human health is vulnerable 
        to environmental degradation. Communities in many parts of Central and 
        South America, Central Africa and Asia are highly vulnerable to water-borne 
        and vector-borne diseases. Air pollution threatens large urban areas and 
        mega-cities, most of which are in developing countries. People in developed 
        countries are more vulnerable to exposure to toxic chemicals and technological 
        accidents but there are notable exceptions such as arsenic contamination 
        in south Asia (see box).</p>

            tube wells that are the main source of drinking water contain dangerous 
            levels of arsenic. Nearly 75 million people are vulnerable to arsenic 
            poisoning which can cause skin cancer, kidney and liver failure, respiratory 
            problems and death. About 24 million people have already been exposed 
            to arsenic poisoning. Agricultural production is affected by arsenic-contaminated 
            water in a 500-km swath of rice paddies and banana groves between 
            the Ganges River and the Indian border.</td>

      <p>Overall, it is estimated that 25-33 per cent of the global burden of 
        disease is attributable to environmental factors (Smith, Corvalán and 
        Kjellström 1999). Recent estimates suggest that environment-related premature 
        death and illness account for 18 per cent of the total burden of disease 
        in the developing world (Murray and Lopez 1996). This comprises contributions 
        from water supply and sanitation (7 per cent), indoor air pollution (4 
        per cent), vector-borne diseases (3 per cent), urban air pollution (2 
        per cent) and agro-industrial waste (1 per cent). In sub-Saharan Africa 
        the figure is even higher at 26.5 per cent, mainly related to water supply 
        and sanitation (10 per cent) and vector-borne diseases (9 per cent).</p>

      <a name="fig307"></a>Globally, 7 per cent of all deaths and diseases are 
      due to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank 
      and WRI 1998). Approximately 5 per cent are attributable to air pollution 
      (Holdren and Smith 2000). Every year, environmental hazards kill 3 million 
      children under the age of five (WHO 2002). Current estimates suggest that 
      40-60 per cent of those deaths are due to acute respiratory infection resulting 
      from environmental factors, particularly particle emissions from solid fuel 
      use (Smith, Corvalán and Kjellström 1999). In the United States, a 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> 
      increase in fine particle air pollution results in a 4 per cent increase 
      in general morbidity, a 6 per cent increase in cardio-pulmonary mortality 
      and an 8 per cent increase in lung cancer mortality (Arden-Pope and others 
      2002). 
      <p>In the short term, disease due to environmental change is likely to have 
        more impact on developing countries than on developed ones. This is partly 
        because developed countries have devoted considerable effort to reducing 
        the health threat from dirty water, poor sanitation and using solid fuels 
        in open fires inside homes. The same is not true for most developing countries. 
        As a result, exposures to particulates for non-smokers are often an order 
        of magnitude lower in developed countries than in developing ones. In 
        Helsinki, for example, the particulates in the air come mainly from indoor 
        dust, cleaning products, traffic and long-range transport (Koistinen and 
        others 2002). In developing countries, the use of solid fuel as a primary 
        energy supply dominates the exposure of non-smokers to particle pollution, 
        especially among women and children in rural and slum environments. In 
        the past decade, smoke haze from forest fires has also become an important 
        source of respiratory disease (see image above). Furthermore, most developing 
        countries still lack the resources to deal effectively with public health 
        crises and are situated in regions where many water-borne and vector-borne 
        diseases are acute.</p>
      <p>Microbiological contamination of the sea by sewage pollution has precipitated 
        a health crisis of massive proportions globally. Bathing in polluted seas 
        is estimated to cause some 250 million cases of gastroenteritis and upper 
        respiratory disease every year, with an estimated annual cost worldwide 
        of about US$1.6 billion. Some of these people will be disabled over the 
        longer-term, suggesting that the global impacts of marine pollution are 
        comparable to those of diphtheria and leprosy (see also <a href="315.htm">Marine 
        pollution</a>). Eating sewage-contaminated shellfish causes an estimated 
        2.5 million cases of infectious hepatitis a year, of whom some 25 000 
        die and another 25 000 suffer longterm disability resulting from liver 
        damage. The annual global burden on human health is estimated to equal 
        some 3.2 million DALYs - comparable to the worldwide impact of all upper 
        respiratory infections and intestinal worm diseases - and to cost world 
        society some US$10 billion annually (GESAMP 2001).</p>
