      <p>A number of major accidents involving chemicals and radioactive materials 
        have drawn attention worldwide to the dangers of mismanagement, particularly 
        in the transport, chemical and nuclear power sectors. These events often 
        have impacts that transcend national boundaries; they also emphasize the 
        fact that issues of technological safety concern more than just the developed 
        countries.</p>

            <p>On 17 August 1999, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4-7.8 on 
              the Richter scale hit the city of Izmit, Turkey, and the surrounding 
              areas. Damage from the earthquake was estimated at more than US$13 
              billion. More than 15 000 people were killed, 25 000 others were 
              injured and 600 000 people were left homeless. The earthquake was 
              blamed for increasing the national account deficit of some US$3 
              billion in 1999-2000 (equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the GNP).</p>
            <p>A significant part of the damage could have been avoided had local 
              building codes been effectively implemented. Many new buildings 
              had not been properly designed, had not been built on foundations 
              strong enough to resist earthquakes, and had not been sited in areas 
              where the effects of earthquakes would have been diminished. </p>

      <a name="fig273"></a>Some disasters have resulted in the introduction of 
      voluntary or mandatory regulations designed to prevent similar occurrences. 
      Public concern following the explosion in 1976 at a pesticide plant in Seveso, 
      Italy, with the release of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD), led 
      to the introduction in 1982 of a European Directive on the major-accident 
      hazards of certain industrial activities. Similarly, other major accidents, 
      such as the methyl isocyanate leak at Bhopal, India, in 1984 and the Switzerland-Sandoz 
      warehouse fire in Basel in 1989, stimulated legislation in many countries 
      to prevent and control chemical incidents. Influenced by the Bhopal accident, 
      in particular, the International Labour Office developed in 1993 the Convention 
      Concerning the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents No. 174 and the 
      Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Recommendation No. 181. These documents 
      call for an international exchange of relevant information, development 
      of policies aimed at addressing the major accident risks, hazards and their 
      consequences, and recognition that a major accident could have serious impacts 
      on human life and the environment. Major nuclear accidents such as those 
      at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 1986 
      have not only catalysed action to strengthen nuclear safety and emergency 
      preparedness but also forced many countries to abandon or severely restrict 
      development of the nuclear power sector. Following the Chernobyl accident, 
      two major international treaties were adopted - the Convention on Assistance 
      in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency and the Convention 
      on the Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. Most recently, the 1994 
      Convention on Nuclear Safety, committing parties to a higher level of nuclear 
      safety, and the 1997 joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
      and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management were adopted. 
      <p>The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska resulted in enormous environmental 
        and economic damages and catalysed the development of the 'Valdez Principles' 
        - a voluntary code of conduct for corporate behaviour towards the environment 
        - by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics (CERES). 
        The 'Valdez Principles' guide corporations in the establishment of environmentally 
        sound policies and require the raising of corporate environmental safety 
        standards and the taking of responsibility for environmental harm that 
        may be caused by them (Adams 1994).</p>
