      <p>Some three-quarters of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean 
        live in cities. Several megacities such as Buenos Aires, Mexico City, 
        Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, each with a population of more than 10 million, 
        are located in the region and economic growth in these urban centres has 
        caused increases in air pollution (particularly CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, 
        tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, hydrocarbons and SPM) and associated human 
        health impacts (UNEP 2000). Today the problem extends beyond large cities 
        and also affects medium-size cities and small islands (Dalal 1979, Romieu, 
        Weitzenfeld and Finkelman 1990). The transport sector is a major source 
        of urban air pollution - 70 per cent of emissions in Buenos Aires (PAHO 
        1998) and Mexico City (INEGI 1998) are transport-related, with the number 
        of cars in Mexico City increasing fourfold between 1970 and 1996 (ECLAC 
        2000a). Industry, agriculture and the municipal sector also contribute 
        to air pollution. In Santiago, the most significant sources of air pollution 
        are transport, and small and mediumsize enterprises (IMO 1995). In addition, 
        unfavourable topographic and meteorological conditions in some cities 
        aggravate the impact of pollution: the Valley of Mexico obstructs the 
        dispersal of pollutants from its metropolitan area as do the hills surrounding 
        Santiago (ECLAC 2000b).</p>

            for 4 000 premature deaths annually (CETESB 1992). Studies in Brazil, 
            Chile and Mexico have shown that a 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of 
            concentration of PM<sub>10</sub> (particles of 10µ or less in diameter) 
            in the air coincides with a 0.6 to 1.3 per cent increase in mortality

      <p>The growth of industry, agriculture and transport sectors over the past 
        30 years has been accompanied by a steady increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        - estimated at 65 per cent between 1980 and 1998 (UNEP 2001a). In 1991-92, 
        the region was estimated to be responsible for some 11 per cent of global 
        anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> - 4.5 per cent of global industrial 
        emissions and 48.5 per cent of emissions from landuse change (UNDP, UNEP, 
        World Bank and WRI 1996). Deforestation is thought to be the principal 
        cause of emissions in the region, particularly in the Amazon basin (UNEP 
        1999). Deforestation and livestock breeding (the latter is significant 
        in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) also result in a huge regional methane 
        emission - some 9.3 per cent of the world total (UNFCCC-SBI 2000).</p>
      <p>The average annual per capita carbon emission from industry in the region 
        was 0.73 tonnes in 1998, somewhat lower than the world average of 1.06 
        tonnes (Marland, Boden and Andres 2001). Mexico is the region's largest 
        carbon emitter.</p>

      <p><a name="fig227"></a>Industrial pollutants originate mostly from fuel 
        combustion processes in the power generation sector, although emissions 
        of heavy metals such as lead and mercury are also important (PAHO 1998). 
        In oilproducing countries, emissions from the refining process are also 
        significant - for example, in Mexico City, almost 60 per cent of SO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions originate from industry, including oil refineries in the metropolitan 
        area (INEGI 1998). In many countries, mining activities result in local 
        deterioration of air quality (PAHO 1998).</p>
      <p>Other sources of air pollution have local and subregional impacts, including 
        pesticide use in agriculture and airborne particles resulting from soil 
        erosion and biomass combustion. Studies conducted in Colombia and Ecuador 
        in the early 1990s revealed that more than 60 per cent of agricultural 
        workers involved in production for foreign markets had symptoms of acute 
        pesticide poisoning (headaches, allergies, dizziness, dermatitis, blurred 
        vision) while others experienced serious chronic effects (stillbirths, 
        miscarriages, and respiratory and neurological problems). Neighbouring 
        inhabitants can also be affected, as has been found for Nicaraguan cotton 
        fields and Costa Rican coffee plantations (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and 
        WRI 1998, UNEP 2000).</p>
      <p>Forest fires are another important contributor to air pollution, sometimes 
        having a significant longdistance effect (CCAD and IUCN 1996, Nepstad 
        and others 1997). In 1997, for example, the smoke from fires in Guatemala, 
        Honduras and Mexico drifted across much of the southeastern United States, 
        prompting the Texas authorities to issue a health warning to residents 
        (UNEP 2000).</p>
      <p>In Latin America and the Caribbean, about onefifth of the population 
        uses biomass as a major household fuel, resulting in indoor air pollution. 
        This mainly affects women, children and the elderly who stay indoors for 
        long periods. In Colombia and Mexico, for example, women using biomass 
        for cooking are up to 75 times more likely to contract chronic lung disease 
        than the average person (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 1998). Air pollution 
        is blamed for 2.3 million annual cases of infantile chronic respiratory 
        sickness and 100 000 cases of chronic adult bronchitis in the region (ECLAC 
        2000b).</p>

          <td>In Mexico City, one of the biggest megacities in the world, studies 
            have shown a close correlation between urban air pollution and the 
            acceleration of pulmonary diseases, ageing processes in the lungs 
            and respiratory infections (Loomis and others 1999, PAHO 1998, WHO 
            1999). A comprehensive programme to cope with air pollution in the 
            Valley of Mexico was launched in 1990 aimed at improving the quality 
            of fuel, promoting public transport, reducing emissions from vehicles, 
            industry and services, and reforestation. The 1995-2000 Programme 
            to Improve Air Quality in Mexico City (Proaire) introduced new activities 
            in the field of monitoring, education and public participation. Other 
            initiatives included the establishment of the Valley of Mexico Environmental 
            Trust Fund, which is maintained with tax revenue from petrol and finances 
            air quality improvement activities, the Automatic Environmental Monitoring 
            Network, Environmental Emergency Programmes, 'A Day Without a Car' 
            Programme, a reforestation programme and environmental education in 
            the metropolitan area of Mexico City (ECLAC 2000a).</td>

      </table>
      <p>In recent decades, significant efforts have been made to cope with air 
        pollution, especially in urban areas (see box) through strategies that 
        include emission controls, changes in fuels and contingency controls. 
        In Santiago, SPM emissions - and the number of days when alerts were sounded 
        or emergencies declared - have been reduced considerably over the past 
        decade, with concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreasing 
        by 24.1 per cent and 47.4 per cent respectively between 1989 and 1999 
        (CAPP 2000). This is largely due to implementation of a plan initiated 
        in 1990 which included control of household and industrial emissions, 
        developing monitoring capacity, removing highly polluting buses, controlling 
        bus circulation and emissions, introducing car catalytic converters, improving 
        motor fuel quality, and paving streets (ECLAC 2000c, O'Ryan and Larraguibel 
        2000).</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the progress achieved, urban air pollution is a serious 
        concern even in some small and medium-sized cities because of the continued 
        growth of the transport and industrial sectors, coupled with a lack of 
        adequate monitoring and regulations. The growth of vehicles due to rising 
        real incomes and the removal of tariffs could nullify the progress made 
        in improving air quality. By 2010, 85 per cent of the population are expected 
        to be living in urban areas, and combating air pollution and preventing 
        its negative health impacts will be a priority in every country.</p>
