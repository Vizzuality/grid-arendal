      <p>Marine and coastal degradation is caused by increasing pressure on both 
        terrestrial and marine natural resources, and on the use of the oceans 
        to deposit wastes. Population growth and increasing urbanization, industrialization 
        and tourism in coastal areas are root causes of this increased pressure. 
        In 1994, an estimated 37 per cent of the global population lived within 
        60 km of the coast - more people than inhabited the planet in 1950. The 
        effects of population are multiplied by both poverty and human consumption 
        patterns. Globally, sewage remains the largest source of contamination, 
        by volume, of the marine and coastal environment, and coastal sewage discharges 
        have increased dramatically in the past three decades.</p>
      <p>Marine and coastal eutrophication from elevated nitrogen inputs has emerged 
        as a worrying trend not foreseen three decades ago. There is increasing 
        evidence that blooms of toxic or otherwise undesirable phytoplankton are 
        increasing in frequency, intensity and geographic distribution. Severe 
        eutrophication has occurred in several enclosed or semi-enclosed seas, 
        including the Black Sea. Human-induced changes in the natural flow of 
        sediment have emerged since the Stockholm Conference as a major threat 
        to coastal habitats. Urban and industrial development drives the construction 
        of residential and industrial infrastructure which, depending on its nature, 
        can alter sediment flow.</p>

          <td>Environmental degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean has 
            increased over the past 30 years. The main pressures on the environment 
            and natural resources are the rising population, increasing inequality 
            of incomes, limited planning, especially in urban areas, and the high 
            dependence of many economies on natural resources exploitation. More 
            than 300 million ha of land have been degraded and almost 30 per cent 
            of the reefs in the Caribbean are considered to be at risk. Of the 
            more than 400 million ha of natural forest lost worldwide over the 
            past 30 years, more than 40 per cent was in the region. Urban environmental 
            problems, especially air pollution, water contamination and inadequate 
            waste disposal, are having severe health impacts on people living 
            in citites, currently 75 per cent of the population. The increasing 
            frequency and intensity of natural disasters, possibly linked to climate 
            change, is having a high human and financial cost. The poorest populations, 
            especially urban ones, are the most vulnerable to such disasters.</td>

      <p>There is particular concern about the possible effects of global warming 
        on coral reefs. During the intense El Niño of 1997-98, extensive coral 
        bleaching occurred on coral reefs worldwide. While some reefs quickly 
        recovered, others, particularly in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, the 
        far western Pacific and the Caribbean, suffered significant mortality, 
        in some cases more than 90 per cent.</p>
      <p>Progress in protecting the marine and coastal environment over the past 
        30 years has generally been confined to relatively few, mostly developed 
        countries, and to a relatively few environmental issues. Overall, coastal 
        and marine environmental degradation not only continues but has intensified.</p>

          <td>Conservation and protection of freshwater resources is a top priority, 
            particularly on the Arabian Peninsula where water deficits are being 
            met mainly through exploitation of groundwater resources. Countries 
            are developing water policies to manage water scarcity by increasing 
            both water supply and conservation, and introducing more efficient 
            irrigation. Land degradation and food security continue to be key 
            environmental issues. The region's seas include some of the busiest 
            shipping areas of the world, making the marine environment susceptible 
            to pollution events such as oil spills. Per capita hazardous waste 
            production is among the highest in the world due to the types of industry 
            in the region. Air emissions from power stations, desalination plants 
            and industrial installations are also of concern.</td>
