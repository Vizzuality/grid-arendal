      <p>Businesses and NGOs play an important role. The industry lobby argues 
        for clear and economically efficient rules and regulations. It also points 
        to the value of voluntary standards and programmes, such as the Global 
        Compact and Global Reporting Initiative negotiated with the United Nations. 
        The NGOs, along with some business groups, stress issues of equity and 
        fairness for current and future generations, as well as respect for other 
        species.</p>
      <p>Over the next decade there is a clear divergence in the follow-through 
        on these various sets of activities. Barriers to trade and movements of 
        capital gradually vanish, as protectionism becomes a thing of the past. 
        New instruments promote market openness and global competition. Virtually 
        all national governments advance a package of policy adjustments, including 
        modernization of financial systems and investment in education to create 
        a workforce that is competitive in the emerging global market. Privatization 
        spreads, social safety nets are reduced and reliance is placed on marketbased 
        approaches.</p>
      <p>There is still distrust of what is viewed as a typically Western mode 
        of development, growing at times into outright hostility. Gradually, however, 
        the shift to a liberalized, market-oriented society becomes almost universal. 
        New technologies, particularly in the form of digital information and 
        communication technologies (ICTs) continue to increase connectivity between 
        different parts of the world. This is reinforced by the presence of multinational 
        corporations, or at the very least their products, in many parts of the 
        world.</p>
      <p>Businesses benefit from liberalization and globalization, and increasingly 
        operate across national borders. At an institutional level, international 
        bodies maintain an important role in guiding economic and related policy 
        in many countries, particularly those that are still burdened by high 
        debt loads. At a personal level, more young people from around the world 
        take the opportunity to travel and study in other countries. Taken together, 
        these factors seem to imply that an air of inevitability surrounds the 
        ongoing processes of globalization. How they play out, however, differs 
        from region to region.</p>
      <p>In Europe, a major focus is on the continuing project of broadening and 
        deepening the EU. The extension of the EU to the east continues with a 
        number of countries being added in waves of accession. Economic interdependence 
        between nations continues to grow, along with widespread adoption of the 
        Euro and harmonization of financial systems. Political union proceeds 
        more slowly, however, as countries prove less willing to forgo their sovereignty 
        in other areas. For example, although most nations are intent on cutting 
        back social safety nets, there are differences over how far and how fast 
        these cuts should be applied. Taxation is also a point of contention. 
        Nevertheless, there is a general shift in governance away from the nation 
        state, to higher as well as to lower levels. By the end of the second 
        decade of the century, various regional bodies, some of which override 
        national borders, play as large a role as some nation states.</p>
      <p>Even as it struggles to deal with persistent conflicts and the AIDS pandemic, 
        Africa pushes ahead with economic modernization and greater integration 
        into the global economy. Shifts away from official development assistance 
        towards foreign direct investment give multinational corporations more 
        influence. At the same time, the influence of international organizations 
        is maintained as efforts continue to restructure and pay off foreign debts. 
        These efforts strongly shape the portfolio of economic investments, which 
        continues to emphasize the production of exports. Regional cooperation, 
        in the form of free trade zones and power pools, works to better integrate 
        the continent. Similarly, transboundary collaboration is expanded in an 
        attempt to deal in some areas with water conflicts, in others to pursue 
        cross-border conservation and development initiatives.</p>
      <p>Continuing dependence on oil throughout the world still provides a strong 
        economic base for much of West Asia, the development of alternative energy 
        sources and efficiency improvements having failed to make more than minimal 
        advances. The strategic importance of the region increases as the world's 
        remaining oil supplies become even more concentrated here and in nearby 
        Central Asia and is a major reason why countries in other regions want 
        to ensure stability in West Asia. Along with local traditions, oil dependence 
        keeps the globalization process from proceeding as quickly in certain 
        areas of society here by comparison with some other regions. Some countries 
        in West Asia continue to grapple with foreign debt. The repayment process 
        keeps moving forward, however, thanks to flexible conditions for debt 
        restructuring. An Arab Free Trade Agreement is eventually reached.</p>
      <p>In the Western Hemisphere, Latin America and the Caribbean become ever 
        more economically integrated with North America. This development is spurred 
        on by the assistance provided by the United States to Mexico in the 1990s 
        and to Argentina and other nations in the 2000s, boosted by the interests 
        of large corporations. It is also seen as a way to address, in part, the 
        joint problems of an ageing and shrinking workforce in the United States 
        and immigration from the south. Moves towards integration culminate in 
        a Free Trade Area for the Americas (FTAA) in the middle of the second 
        decade of the century. In the process, existing trade agreements like 
        North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Commom Market of the South 
        (MERCOSUR) and Caribbean Community (CARICOM), get absorbed under the FTAA 
        umbrella. A number of nations go further, adopting the US dollar as a 
        national currency.</p>
      <p>In the Asia and the Pacific region, the recovery from the economic downturn 
        of the late 1990s and from the decade-long recession in Japan, sees many 
        countries return to the patterns of growth and degree of integration into 
        the world economy they had previously experienced. To this are added the 
        continued economic reforms in China and India, the two most populous nations 
        in the world. With its accession into the WTO, China becomes a major world 
        importer and exporter, eventually growing to rival the United States as 
        the world's largest economy. The advances in technology coming out of 
        Asia and the Pacific, the impact on corporations that set up facilities 
        here and the increased exposure of its cultures all enlarge the role this 
        region plays on the global stage. </p>
