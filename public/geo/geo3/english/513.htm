      <p>Levels of risk and associated human vulnerability change over time. In 
        a resilient society, with appropriate interventions, recovery and mitigation 
        can bring vulnerability back to a previous (baseline) level or reduce 
        it to a lower level, but too fast a rate of change may exceed the capacity 
        of the society to adapt. The long-term nature of environmental change 
        may mean that potential future vulnerability is equally as important as 
        present vulnerability. The capacity to adapt may be more important in 
        determining human vulnerability in the long run than the ability to cope 
        with present critical situations.</p>
      <p>The degree and extent of vulnerability appears to be increasing because 
        of a combination of such factors as the increasing impact of humans on 
        the environment, reductions in the efficient functioning of ecosystems, 
        the reduced ability of the environment to provide goods and services, 
        growing and more spatially concentrated populations, and increasing human 
        settlement in high risk areas. As human impact on the environment increases, 
        so people's options decrease. Human vulnerability to environmental change 
        thus increases, despite many instances of adequate coping capacity.</p>
      <p>Assessments contribute to better-informed decisions on preparedness, 
        mitigation, relief and rehabilitation activities but there is a lag between 
        the time it takes to make such assessments and the optimal response time. 
        There is a growing gap between rapid rates of environmental degradation 
        and the slow pace of social response. This gap threatens to drain the 
        environment of assets and options for future generations and to increase 
        the costs of substitutes for missing resources (Kasperson and others 1999). 
        High priority should therefore be given to rapid assessments of vulnerability 
        and the design of initial protective responses, such as early warning 
        systems, while longer-term remedial measures are put in place. Environmental 
        restoration, with its potential to reduce vulnerability, will thus become 
        an increasingly important component of sustainable development.</p>
      <p>The complexity of the change process makes assessing and measuring human 
        vulnerability to long-term or future environmental change highly speculative 
        and it is hard to determine the kinds of investment that would most effectively 
        deal with the threats in question. A better understanding of the interplay 
        of the social and physical factors that determine human vulnerability 
        needs to be developed to increase the ability to mitigate potentially 
        harmful impacts that arise from environmental change. Cause-and-effect 
        linkages need to be investigated. Systems modelling approaches and sensitivity 
        analysis may help to determine the nature and timing of the most costeffective 
        measures to anticipate threats where uncertainty and complex relationships 
        are important.</p>
      <p>Delaying a response to an environmental threat often stems from uncertainty, 
        or a lack of knowledge. Improving the assessment process can help resolve 
        this although, even when the risks are known, action may not follow. Nevertheless, 
        regional studies suggest that the breakdown in response is more attributable 
        to narrow government policies aimed solely at economic growth, coupled 
        with a lack of political will, government willingness to tolerate damage 
        in marginal areas and among vulnerable peoples, and widespread political 
        corruption than to public apathy or lack of awareness (Kasperson and others 
        1999). These are all issues to be tackled.</p>
      <p>In the recent past, responses to human vulnerability have progressed 
        from single measures to address a single issue (such as controlling floods 
        by building dykes) to the development of a mix of measures serving different 
        purposes (multipurpose dam projects, warning systems, insurance, land 
        use zoning, integrated river basin management). Today, issues are being 
        visualized in the even broader context of sustainable development (Mitchell 
        2000). To support these new kinds of policy making, approaches need to 
        be even further integrated to improve the chances of capturing all aspects 
        of human vulnerability.</p>

            <p>In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development called 
              for the:</p>
            <ul class="global">
              <li>identification of critical threats to the survival, security 
                or well-being of all or of a majority of people, globally and 
                regionally;</li>
              <li>assessment of the causes and likely human, economic and ecological 
                consequences of those threats, with regular and public reporting 
                of the findings;</li>
              <li>provision of authoritative advice on what must be done to avoid, 
                reduce, or adapt to these threats; and</li>
              <li>provision of an additional source of advice to governments and 
                intergovernmental organizations on policies and programmes to 
                address these threats.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the report of the Commission was published, IPCC has set 
              up a vulnerability task group, and the System for Analysis, Research 
              and Training (START) and the Project on Critical Environmental Zones 
              were initiated. These studies demonstrated that the coping capacity 
              of countries differs considerably. IPCC claims that vulnerability 
              and coping capacity are inversely related and socially differentiated.</p>

      <p>In an increasing number of areas, environmental damage may be irreversible, 
        or restoration and the reduction in threat may require such a long time 
        that accommodation must accompany any remedial measures. Enabling people 
        to adapt to such situations, especially where change may accelerate in 
        the future, should accompany short-term disaster prevention and management 
        measures. Adaptation is vital where the impacts to which people are vulnerable 
        appear inevitable.</p>
      <p>Stakeholder participation is important in responding to human vulnerability, 
        both to ensure a 'reality check' on coping capacity and to boost prospects 
        of success by involving as many stakeholders as possible in implementing 
        coping mechanisms (IFRC 1999). Stakeholders should review and strengthen 
        their capabilities in the areas of preparedness and mitigation to increase 
        coping capacities, and become involved in post-event examination of new 
        initiatives that might reduce losses in the future. Communities with effective 
        mitigation strategies could look into ways to help other populations at 
        risk from similar threats. In all cases, assessments of community conditions 
        should provide decision-makers with all the relevant information they 
        need to make strategic decisions to counter vulnerability.</p>
      <p>This consideration of human vulnerability has demonstrated that the continuing 
        loss of environmental defences and accelerating global change are increasing 
        threats to human well-being and are putting sustainable development at 
        risk. The evidence suggests that many areas of the world are on trajectories 
        that will lead them into crisis and that little time is left for creating 
        effective responses if deteriorating situations are to be stabilized (Kasperson 
        and others 1999). People are less and less the helpless victims of 'acts 
        of God' and more and more the victims of 'acts of man'. But an increasing 
        understanding of environmental processes and a growing capacity for early 
        warning should help to identify threats and risks and react appropriately. 
        There are now also better means of preventing and reducing harm to people 
        and damage to economies and communities. An increased investment now in 
        sound environmental management, community preparedness and vulnerability 
        reduction will result in important savings in the future.</p>
