      <p>Air pollution was one of the threats to human health and ecosystems that 
        was recognized early in Europe. A treaty (the 1979 ECE Convention on Long 
        Range Transboundary Air Pollution, CLRTAP) was signed as early as the 
        late 1970s and entered into force in 1983 to curb anthropogenic emissions 
        of harmful substances.</p>

          <td>A recent health impact assessment of air pollution in Austria, France 
            and Switzerland revealed that car-related pollution kills more people 
            than car accidents in these three countries. Long-term exposure to 
            air pollution from cars causes an extra 21 000 premature deaths from 
            respiratory or heart disease per year in adults over 30. In comparison, 
            the total annual deaths from road traffic accidents in these countries 
            are 9 947. Each year air pollution from cars in the three countries 
            causes 300 000 extra cases of bronchitis in children, 15 000 hospital 
            admissions for heart disease, 395 000 asthma attacks in adults and 
            162 000 in children, and some 16 million person-days of restricted 
            activities for adults over 20 years old because of respiratory disorders. 
            The total cost of this health impact is €27 billion per year or 1.7 
            per cent of the combined GNP of the three countries. This is the equivalent 
            of €360/person/year (Kunzli and others 2000).</td>

      <p>The main sectors and activities driving air pollution in Western Europe 
        in the past three decades have been energy, transport, industry, agriculture, 
        solvent use, and storage and distribution of fossil fuels. In Central 
        and Eastern European (CEE) countries, the power and heavy industry sectors 
        have traditionally been the major polluters, with transport only significant 
        in major cities. In the early 1990s, economic recession was a driver in 
        the decrease of air pollution in CEE but at the same time there was a 
        sharp growth in the use of private cars. For example, even during the 
        worst recession years (1990 to 1994), the number of private cars in Armenia, 
        Russia and Ukraine increased by more than 100 per cent (FSRFHEM 1996). 
        This rapid increase in private car ownership has made transport an increasingly 
        important contributor to CEE’s air quality problems.</p>

      <p><a name="fig224"></a>Emissions of most key air pollutants have declined 
        over the whole of Europe since the early 1980s. By the end of 2000, emissions 
        of sulphur compounds had been reduced to less than one-third of 1980 levels 
        in Western Europe, and to two-thirds of those levels in CEE (EEA 2001a, 
        UNEP 1999). A significant recovery of natural acid balance of water and 
        soils has been observed in Europe, mainly due to reductions in SO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions, although the emissions are still too high to avoid serious 
        effects in sensitive ecosystems. Average figures, however, mask a wide 
        variation among countries and sub-regions. For instance, SO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions increased by 7 per cent in Greece and 3 per cent in Portugal 
        between 1990 and 1998 while reductions of 71 per cent and 60 per cent 
        were observed in Germany and Finland respectively (EEA 2000). NO<sub>x</sub> 
        and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions have not decreased significantly in Western 
        Europe except for NO<sub>x</sub> in Germany and the United Kingdom but 
        NO<sub>x</sub> has been reduced in many CEE countries (Czech Environmental 
        Institute and Ministry of the Environment 1996, EEA 2001b, GRID-Budapest 
        1999, GRID-Warsaw 1998, Interstate Statistical Committee 1999, OECD 1999a, 
        UNECE/EMEP/MSC 1998). A lack of monitoring of emissions of heavy metals, 
        POPs and SPM, especially in CEE countries, means that no convincing trends 
        can be observed but it is clear that particulate matter and tropospheric 
        ozone precursors still represent serious problems (EEA 2000).</p>

      <p><a name="fig225"></a>In Western Europe, emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, 
        NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> have shown a clear de-coupling from 
        GDP growth, pointing towards some degree of effectiveness of measures 
        taken (EEA 2001a). In some of the CEE countries that are likely to be 
        in the first wave of accession to the European Union (EU), economic restructuring 
        and environmental actions also appear to have had an effect in reducing 
        air pollution. In other CEE countries, the fall in industrial output due 
        to the recession appears to have been the main factor in air pollution 
        reduction (OECD 1999a and b, UNECE 1999). In countries such as Russia 
        and Ukraine, emissions per unit of GDP have actually increased but the 
        effect has been masked by the overall fall in GDP (SCRFEP 1999).</p>
      <p>It is clear that the reductions in emissions are at least partly due 
        to national and local measures that have been taken to achieve targets 
        set by CLRTAP and its Protocols, and to EU Directives linked to air emissions 
        such as the Limitation of Emissions of Certain Pollutants into the Air 
        from Large Combustion Plants Directive (1988) and various directives on 
        vehicle emissions, the change to unleaded petrol and higher quality diesel 
        fuels and improved engine design. Despite this clear progress, many air 
        pollution reduction targets have still not been met. In Western Europe, 
        only the EU and CLRTAP targets for SO<sub>2</sub> were met well before 
        the target date (the end of 2000) with less progress on NO<sub>x</sub>, 
        NH<sub>3</sub> and VOCs. Two recent European measures are expected to 
        achieve further reductions in air pollutants: a proposal for an EU Directive 
        on National Emission Ceilings for Certain Atmospheric Pollutants (NECD) 
        and the CLRTAP Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level 
        Ozone. In many European countries, additional measures will be required 
        to achieve the NECD and CLRTAP Protocol targets. In Western Europe ‘non-technical’ 
        measures for controlling pollution such as road pricing and tax incentives 
        have become more important (EC 2000) but in many CEE countries it is unlikely 
        that currently weak environmental protection bodies can enforce an effective 
        air pollution reduction strategy in the near future (OECD 1999b). </p>
