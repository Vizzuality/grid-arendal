      <p><a name="fig392"></a>Infrastructure developments, often related to fishing 
        and tourism in both the Arctic and the Antarctic, and to oil, gas and 
        other mineral development in the Arctic, expand significantly in a <i>Markets 
        First </i>world (see chart for the situation in the Arctic). In the Antarctic, 
        this includes spontaneous private colonization by a limited number of 
        economically and technology-rich individuals or entities. In the Arctic, 
        habitats of wide-ranging species, such as the caribou, reindeer, grizzly 
        bear and musk ox are severely fragmented and encroached upon. All Arctic 
        wildlife is substantially affected either directly or indirectly from 
        the disruption of the food chain, from habitat loss and from the insidious 
        impacts of climate change. Excessive hunting further reduces some of the 
        populations to biologically unsustainable levels. </p>
      <p>In <i>Policy First</i>, these pressures are kept in check, although effects 
        of decades of warming - on land and sea - are visible over large expanses. 
        Responsible planning decisions have prevailed and wildlife habitat has 
        remained relatively intact. In many cases this is due to the improved 
        effectiveness of habitat management, particularly in protected areas which 
        are now integrated into circumpolar and north-south networks. The numbers 
        and size of protected areas have increased significantly, but many sites 
        still have inadequate regulations on mineral, oil and gas exploration 
        and extraction and hydropower generation. Hunting is sustainable in most 
        parts of the Arctic and quotas are based on much improved scientific evidence.</p>
      <p><i>Security First </i>sees permanent residence in Antarctica becoming 
        possible for personnel employed by industries active in the area and as 
        a status symbol for the wealthy. Numbers of endemic wildlife in the Arctic 
        plummet, the food chain is disrupted and genetic diversity is weakened 
        due to habitat degradation and fragmentation. Opportunistic alien species 
        able to survive in the warming climate have filled available niches. However, 
        even they are having a hard time due to contamination by wastes and habitat 
        destruction.</p>
      <p>In <i>Sustainability First</i>, biodiversity hot spots and habitats are 
        protected and large areas are set aside as national parks or nature reserves 
        to help wildlife cope with climate change. Small, regulated subsistence 
        hunts are still allowed in accordance with agreements negotiated with 
        indigenous peoples. The public does not tolerate poaching. Residence in 
        the Antarctic is denied for anything other than specifically agreed purposes, 
        generally scientific research.</p>
      <p>In the Arctic, the condition of the boreal forests differs markedly between 
        scenarios. Large areas of forest in the region have come under stress 
        from rapid climate change, leading to long-term shifts in temperature 
        and precipitation, as well as to increasing incidence of fires. Continued 
        and increasing levels of logging in <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security 
        First </i>further exacerbate these pressures. Most notably, in <i>Security 
        First </i>muddy plains and clear-cut forested areas have replaced many 
        of the once vast pristine landscapes.</p>

        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <p>Clear signs emerge that circumpolar Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia 
              superba</i>) stocks are crashing. The immediate cause is believed 
              to be commercial over-harvesting, but the picture is complicated 
              by simultaneous sea-ice changes and rises in ultraviolet radiation 
              levels, both of which are believed to affect krill population dynamics. 
              There is evidence of serious adverse impacts on breeding success 
              of Antarctic birds, seals and cetaceans within a few seasons, leading 
              to serious concerns over the viability of populations of higher 
              predators. Indications of severe damage to stocks of other marine 
              species - initially evident through declining stocks of fin-fish 
              and squid - raise concern about the stability of the entire Antarctic 
              marine ecosystem, and knock-on effects on other ecosystems in and 
              around the subregion. Dramatic falls in catches of krill and commercial 
              fisheries stocks that prey on krill, result in widespread reduction 
              in fishing activity and collapse of the fishing industry in some 
              areas. The treaties, institutions and other international arrangements 
              set up to conserve and manage the fishery are seen as having failed. 
              Public concern runs high at the prospect of threats to charismatic 
              wildlife species such as penguins, seals and whales.</p>

            <p><b>The lessons</b><br>
              Existing knowledge of many natural systems is limited, including 
              the thresholds for resource exploitation, beyond which systems collapse. 
              Such thresholds may be reached in a comparatively sudden way. It 
              makes sense, therefore, to continue efforts to improve understanding, 
              but also to take a precautionary approach where baseline data are 
              lacking, where uncertainty is high and where irreversible impacts 
              are possible. This course of action may avoid the need to take more 
              drastic action in the event of a system crash.</p>
