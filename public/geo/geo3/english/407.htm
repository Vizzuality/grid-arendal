      <p><a name="fig245"></a>Many urban environmental problems are the result 
        of poor management, poor planning and absence of coherent urban policies 
        rather than of urbanization itself. Through experience, it has been learned 
        that no amount of finance, technology or expertise can secure environmentally 
        sustainable development - or protect the environment - if the fundamentals 
        of governance are not participatory, democratic and pluralistic. For example, 
        many developing countries have extensive regulations on pollution, most 
        of which are seldom if ever applied effectively because of the lack of 
        proper institutions, legal systems, political will and competent governance 
        (Hardoy, Mitlin and Satterthwaite 2001). Unfortunately, particularly where 
        economic and social change is rapid, established political and administrative 
        institutions have proved highly resistant to change.</p>
      <p>The past 30 years have seen significant political change with profound 
        implications for urban areas and for the urban and global environment. 
        These include:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>the collapse of central planning; </li>
        <li>the extension of democracy; </li>
        <li>decentralization and demands for empowerment and self-determination;</li>
        <li>increasing pluralism in politics and society; and</li>
        <li>pressures for participation, accountability and transparency in government. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These trends appear to be strengthening, reinforced by globalization 
        and especially by the impact of freer and faster flows of information 
        and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Efforts to improve urban governance involve activities such as promoting 
        participatory processes; developing effective partnerships with and among 
        all actors of civil society, particularly the private and community sectors; 
        securing greater effective empowerment of local government, including 
        greater autonomy in finance and legislation; and reform of unresponsive 
        organizations and bureaucratic structures.</p>

          <td>The Dandora garbage dump in Nairobi provides a livelihood for many 
            scavengers. In 1992 Father Alex Zanoteteli started the Mukuru Recycling 
            Centre, helping the scavengers work together to collect different 
            types of garbage more efficiently and sell to middlemen for better 
            prices. The project now has 140 members and with the help of Habitat's 
            Settlements, Infrastructure and Environment Programme has organized 
            itself into a cooperative, with several different projects. One buys 
            waste from individual scavengers, sorts it and sells it to recycling 
            industries - in addition to running a dairy project. Another gathers 
            waste from commercial buildings in the city; it earns small fees for 
            cleaning up the commercial buildings and income from selling the waste 
            to paper and other recycling industries. A third manufactures fuel 
            briquettes from paper and other waste such as sawdust and coffee husks. 
            A fourth manufactures compost from organic waste. The centre is about 
            to establish a facility for recycling plastic.</td>

      <p>They also involve city-to-city cooperation and exchange of experiences 
        and lessons learned. The International Council for Local Environmental 
        Initiatives works with 286 local governments in 43 countries to improve 
        local energy management and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Skinner 2000). 
        Initiatives such as the Stockholm Partnership for Sustainable Cities have 
        been developed to introduce sustainability into city planning through 
        partnership between cities and business. Habitat's Local Agenda 21 initiatives 
        have been proved effective in implementing sustainable development policies 
        that involve community members and government (Tuts and Cody 2000).</p>
      <p>Because of the importance of specific local circumstances and political 
        realities, there is no viable approach to solving urban environmental 
        problems that can be applied in every city. A first step is to develop 
        a local environmental agenda to assess the local situation regarding environmental 
        issues so that this information can be used in city planning. Whereas 
        the emphasis in 1970 was largely focused on public policy and regulation, 
        the focus of the early 1990s was on markets and technical solutions. At 
        the turn of the century, urban environmental management appears to be 
        focusing more on changing cultures - corporate, economic and political 
        (Elkington 1999).</p>

          <td> 
            <p>Growing food in and around cities has become a major industry, 
              vital to the wellbeing of millions of poor and some not-so-poor 
              urban residents. It is estimated that 15 per cent of all the food 
              consumed in urban areas is grown by urban farmers and that this 
              percentage will double within 20 years. Some 800 million people 
              are estimated to be involved in urban farming worldwide (see '<a href="138.htm">Land</a>'). 
              The following examples from different regions illustrate the potential 
              of urban agriculture.</p>
            <p><b>Africa</b><br>
              The cultivation of food crops is economically significant in many 
              African urban areas, where city dwellers pay 10 to 30 per cent more 
              for their food than do rural inhabitants. In Kenya and Tanzania, 
              two out of three urban families engage in farming, and nearly every 
              open space, utility service reserve, road, valley or garden in the 
              towns has been taken up for crop planting. In Cairo, one-quarter 
              of all households raise small livestock which provide 60 per cent 
              of household incomes.</p>
            <p>Women play a vital role in urban agriculture, many of whom engage 
              in cultivation as a survival strategy. This process of the 'ruralization' 
              of African cities is not a consequence of mass rural-urban migration 
              but is a response to fluctuations in the economies of developing 
              countries' cities. Urban cultivation is not practised exclusively 
              or even primarily by recent migrants. Most farmers originate from 
              poor households that are fully entrenched in the urban economy.</p>
            <p><b>Latin America and the Caribbean</b><br>
              Every available space - including roofs and balconies - has been 
              given over to urban food production in Cuba's capital, Havana. Intensive 
              urban farming methods including hydroponics help secure fresh food 
              for urban dwellers. The city council facilitates the integrated 
              management of wastewater for food production.</p>
            <p>Regional standards for wastewater treatment are developed by the 
              Pan American Centre for Sanitary Engineering and Environment Sciences 
              in Lima, Peru. Systems of wastewater management and re-use at different 
              levels of purity, from woodlots to aquaculture, are promoted and 
              utilized in several countries in the region.</p>
            <p><b>Europe</b><br>
              Some 72 per cent of all urban households in the Russian Federation 
              raise food, and Berlin has more than 80 000 urban farmers. The St 
              Petersburg Urban Gardening Club has become famous for its promotion 
              of roof top gardening. Its research shows that in just one district 
              (St Petersburg has 12) it is possible to grow 2 000 tonnes of vegetables 
              per season from 500 roof tops. Many crops are grown including radishes, 
              lettuce, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, peas, beets, beans 
              and flowers. The growth of chicory for salads is encouraged as a 
              source of vitamins in the winter. Rooftop gardening is popular because 
              the gardens are secure and cannot be attacked by vandals. The St 
              Petersburg Urban Gardening Club publishes books and has its own 
              web site. </p>
