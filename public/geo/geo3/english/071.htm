      <p>Thirty years ago, many toxic and persistent chemicals were considered 
        to be not only resources but also pollutants adversely affecting human 
        health and the environment, particularly where they could be accumulated 
        up the food chain or transported long distances over the globe. Today, 
        chemicals are seen as even more essential to development, and as a resource 
        that needs to be managed to protect or even enhance human health and the 
        environment. This sound management of chemicals applies to both those 
        anthropogenically produced and those of natural origin, including those 
        generated through biological processes.</p>
      <p>The international community has recently concluded a landmark convention 
        to control the use of a group of persistent toxic organic compounds (see 
        box). In December, 2000 representatives of 122 governments finalized the 
        text of a legally binding treaty for implementing international action 
        on certain persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Stockholm Convention 
        on Persistent Organic Pollutants, signed in May 2001 and which had 111 
        signatories and 2 Parties as of December 2001, sets out control measures 
        covering 12 chemicals. The control provisions call for eliminating production 
        and use of intentionally produced POPs and eliminating unintentionally 
        produced POPs where this is feasible (UNEP 2001).</p>

            <p>The POPs treaty covers an initial list of 12 chemicals, the so-called 
              'dirty dozen':</p>
            <ul class="global">
              <li>eight pesticides - aldrin, chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 
                (DDT), dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex and toxaphene; </li>
              <li>two industrial chemicals - polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
                and hexachlorobenzene (which is also a pesticide); and </li>
              <li>two unwanted by-products of combustion and industrial processes 
                (dioxins and furans).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A health-related exemption has been granted for DDT, which is still 
              needed in many countries to control malarial mosquitoes until 2025. 
              Governments may also maintain existing equipment that contains PCBs 
              in a way that prevents leaks to give them time to arrange for PCB-free 
              replacements. PCBs have been widely used in electrical transformers 
              and other equipment. </p>
            <p>The Convention also designates GEF as its primary financial mechanism, 
              on an interim basis, through which developed countries will channel 
              new and additional resources to help countries with economies in 
              transition and developing countries to implement their obligations. 
              It also provides for a science-based process, incorporating precaution, 
              to review other chemicals for possible addition by the Conference 
              of the Parties.</p>

      <p>Since the Stockholm Conference, the global chemicals industry has grown 
        almost ninefold and an annual growth rate of about 3 per cent is expected 
        to continue over the next three decades, with a considerable increase 
        in trade (OECD 2001). This will increase the risk of exposing an increasing 
        number of people and the environment to new chemicals and the potential 
        for the emergence of new diseases of chemical origin.</p>
      <p>Information about the release of chemicals into the environment is now 
        much more widely available than used to be the case. North America has 
        led action in this area, in particular with the US Toxics Release Inventory 
        (TRI 2001) enacted through the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know 
        Act (EPCRA) in the United States in 1986. EPCRA's purpose is to inform 
        communities and citizens of chemical hazards in their areas. The Act requires 
        businesses to report the locations and quantities of chemicals stored 
        on-site to state and local governments. Through EPCRA, the US Congress 
        mandated that a Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) be made public. TRI provides 
        citizens with information about potentially hazardous chemicals and their 
        use so that communities have more power to hold companies accountable 
        and make informed decisions about how toxic chemicals are to be managed.</p>
