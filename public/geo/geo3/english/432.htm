      <p>Urban sprawl is defined as low-density, automobiledependent residential 
        development (Dowling 2000). It is equated with intrusion into rural or 
        undeveloped land on the periphery of a city or town, beyond the edge of 
        service and employment areas (Chen 2000). Sprawling sub-divisions in post-war 
        North America have been fuelled by economic expansion and encouraged by 
        incentives for home ownership, singleuse zoning, government subsidies, 
        and investments in highways and suburban infrastructure (ULI 1999, Sierra 
        Club 2000a). As tax-paying, middle-income families left urban centres, 
        many cities turned into impoverished city cores surrounded by car-dependent 
        suburbs serviced by malls.</p>

      <a name="fig260"></a>In the United States, a cycle of public transit decline, 
      increased car use and longer commuting distances took place over the 1970s 
      and 1980s; this was mirrored by Canada during the 1990s. Between 1981 and 
      1991, the number of car-kilometres travelled by Canadian and US citizens 
      grew by 23 and 33.7 per cent respectively (EC 1998, Raad and Kenworthy 1998). 
      The trend of increased urban car use and stagnant or declining transit use 
      is illustrated on the left. 
      <p>Encouraged during the 1990s by new road building and low fuel prices, 
        the US suburban population grew by 11.9 per cent between 1990 and 1998, 
        compared with 4.7 per cent for central cities (Pope 1999, Baker 2000, 
        HUD 2000). Today, one-half of US sprawl appears to be related to population 
        increase and the other half to land-use and consumption choices that increase 
        the amount of urban land occupied per resident (Kolankiewicz and Beck 
        2001).</p>
      <p>Suburban developments have been built over vast areas of North America's 
        forests, wetlands, recreational wilderness and agricultural land. As these 
        landscape features are lost, so are the services they provide, such as 
        wildlife habitat, flood and run-off control, and soil productivity (Parfrey 
        1999). Between 1982 and 1992, an average of 5 670 km<sup>2</sup> a year 
        of prime farmland in the United States was developed for urban use (NRCS 
        2000). Today, an average of 9 320 km<sup>2</sup> of land is being converted 
        annually, with a substantial portion for suburban homes on lots of 0.5 
        ha (HUD 2000). In Canada, the urban areas occupying land that could be 
        used for crop production increased from about 9 000 km<sup>2</sup> in 
        1971 to 14 000 km<sup>2</sup> in 1996 (Statistics Canada 2000).</p>
      <p>Urban sprawl has environmental, social and economic consequences including 
        traffic congestion, deteriorating inner cities that are often fragmented 
        along class and racial lines, and suburban problems of isolation and lack 
        of sense of community (Raad and Kenworthy 1998, Dowling 2000). Canadian 
        cities are much less affected by sprawl than their US counterparts (Parfrey 
        1999, Baker 2000, Sierra Club 2000b).</p>
      <p>Increasingly, state and local governments are implementing smart growth 
        and sustainable development plans (see box below). Studies show that where 
        urban density is highest, car use per capita is the lowest (Raad and Kenworthy 
        1998). Successful 'infill' projects in which decaying properties or vacant 
        lots are developed to help cities rebound are now more common. On the 
        other hand, in many places it is still less expensive in the short term 
        for developers to buy and build on land outside city zones (Chen 2000) 
        .</p>

            <p>Over the past 10 years, a 'smart growth' movement has emerged in 
              North America to combat urban sprawl. Smart growth is characterized 
              by a mix of residential, office and retail land uses close to civic 
              buildings clustered in a town centre. 'Smart' growth is emphasized 
              rather than 'no' growth, and reform codes and ordinances are sought 
              that permit smart growth characteristics and that create urban growth 
              boundaries (ULI 1999). Smart growth is promoted by a broad coalition 
              including environmental NGOs, social justice activists, local government 
              officials, urban planners and affordable housing advocates. The 
              movement promotes high-density neighbourhoods that reduce car use.</p>
            <p>Compact development techniques advocated by smart growth and sustainable 
              city initiatives include building within an already urbanized area, 
              redeveloping on cleaned-up contaminated sites or 'brownfields', 
              and cluster development on reduced-size lots. Such developments 
              use less land area and help reduce travel distances, encourage walking 
              and cycling, stimulate public transit, preserve open green spaces, 
              wildlife habitat and farmland, and reduce impervious surface areas 
              thereby improving drainage and water quality (US EPA 2001).</p>

      </table>
      <p>At the federal level, initiatives to help address sprawl-related problems 
        include the US 1998 Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21) and the Livable 
        Communities Programme. Most activity addressing urban sprawl takes place 
        at the planning level of government, however. Many of Canada's major urban 
        regions are instituting long-range transportation plans aimed at reducing 
        car dependency and adopting sustainability strategies for higher density, 
        mixed use urban development (Raad and Kenworthy 1998).</p>
      <p>There are still many hurdles on the path to sustainable cities: powers 
        to address urban sprawl are generally split among federal, state/province 
        and local governments, and their proper roles are still undefined (Stoel 
        Jr 1999, Dowling 2000); effective compliance regimes to ensure implementation 
        are lacking (Raad and Kenworthy 1998); to some, smart growth implies the 
        loss of individual freedom and property rights fueling an anti-smart growth 
        lobby (Stoel Jr 1999); vested interests of the car manufacturing industry 
        are strong, while suburban sprawl is so entrenched in the North American 
        landscape and psyche that reversing the trend is a formidable challenge.</p>
