      <p>The consequences of global climate change on agriculture and ecosystems 
        are highly uncertain. Based on simulation models, the most likely impacts 
        are netfavourable effects for the cooler margins of the temperate zone, 
        and adverse consequences for the sub-tropical semi-arid zone (see box). 
        Regional changes in climate have already affected diverse physical and 
        biological systems in many parts of the world. Mid- to high-latitude growing 
        seasons have lengthened. Poleward and altitudinal shifts of plant and 
        animal ranges have been observed (IPCC 2001). Natural systems at risk 
        of climate change include glaciers, atolls, polar and alpine ecosystems, 
        prairie wetlands and remnant native grasslands. Human systems that are 
        vulnerable include agriculture, particularly food security, and forestry.</p>

            <p>'Many people identify growing population pressures of the poor 
              and the resultant overgrazing, deforestation and unsustainable agricultural 
              practices as major causes of desertification. This theory, however, 
              is based on the assumption that only the poor and their growing 
              populations cause environmental degradation. It misses the impact 
              of a chain of international trade and economic practices which result 
              in low prices for agricultural and livestock commodities for the 
              South; and political compulsions such as debt, which force a country 
              to promote adverse land use practices in order to earn foreign exchange. 
              In its simplistic reaction, the West chooses to provide food, first 
              through aid and then by promoting increased agricultural production. 
              The problem still persists, showing that the solution is far more 
              complex.'</p>

      <p>From the 1990s, the climate change issue directed attention to the role 
        of land as a terrestrial store of carbon. Land degradation almost always 
        involves a loss of soil organic matter. If this trend can be checked or 
        reversed, a considerable potential exists for carbon sequestration through 
        building up the levels of carbon stored in soils and the vegetation cover 
        (IFAD/FAO 1999).</p>
