      <p>Government efforts to tackle environmental and social problems are generally 
        late in coming and ineffective in scope. Furthermore, governments use 
        much of their power to protect the economic interests of national and 
        corporate enterprises to which they are increasingly tied. NGOs and other 
        groups in civil society find themselves focusing more and more on short-term 
        crises, rather than working to influence long-term development patterns.</p>
      <p>This trend is epitomized by the collapse of the Antarctic Treaty system, 
        a result of pressure from non-claimant states and non-state actors, coupled 
        with the failure of claimant states to reach agreement on resource exploitation 
        and environmental protection. There is a rush to exploit the region's 
        mineral and marine living assets, including freshwater in the form of 
        ice. This free-for-all does not mean equal access for all groups, as the 
        more powerful states and large corporations still exert dominance. Exploitation 
        of resources by these groups also speeds up in the Arctic. There, the 
        impacts have an important social element as native peoples gain little 
        benefit. Although many people move north to take part in the expanded 
        economic activity, most income flows out of the region.</p>
      <p>As the decade proceeds, the effects of the erosion of institutions at 
        the international and national levels become more apparent. If the first 
        decade was a period of muddling through, this is one of stumbling and 
        serious falls. Conflicts in various parts of the world never coalesce 
        to form what might be called a Third World War. They do, however, escalate 
        in particular regions and at particular times to destabilize nations. 
        Of even more concern to some is the sporadic use of chemical, biological 
        and other non-conventional weapons. The sheer numbers of refugees also 
        creates severe problems in neighbouring (mainly noncombatant) states. 
        The ability of international institutions such as the United Nations High 
        Commission for Refugees to cope with these events has been compromised 
        by reductions in support, leaving them overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>These conflicts, along with enduring economic weaknesses and environmental 
        deterioration, affect regions further afield, as migration pressures increase 
        throughout the world. These pressures stem not only from factors within 
        regions forcing migration, but also from tantalizing images broadcast 
        by the media that lure them elsewhere. The response of the receiving countries 
        is mixed, with some more open to new immigrants than others. Over time, 
        however, even the countries and regions with relatively open borders begin 
        clamping down as they focus on problems at home.</p>
      <p>Some of these problems spring from recurrent economic malaise. In North 
        America, Europe and parts of Asia and the Pacific, part of the problem 
        is the declining size of workforces. Allowing highly educated and skilled 
        workers from other regions to immigrate eases this shortage somewhat. 
        Unfortunately the deterioration of educational opportunities in many regions 
        has reduced the availability of such workers. From the perspective of 
        their home regions, the departure of even a small number of skilled migrant 
        workers represents a significant loss of indigenous capacity. The repercussions 
        affect economic and political stability, further widening the gap between 
        have and have-not nations.</p>
      <p>Environmental changes and events also have widespread effects, in wealthy 
        and poorer regions alike. The impacts of climate change and variability 
        become more apparent. The gradual rise in sea level is punctuated by severe 
        storms that cause heavy damage to coastal (and even some inland) areas. 
        In Europe, North America and the wealthier parts of Asia and the Pacific, 
        the financial losses are staggering, even if there are no dramatic losses 
        of life. Re-financing on a huge scale, not only to recover the losses 
        where possible, but also to prepare for future events, diverts important 
        resources from other parts of the economy.</p>
      <p>In other regions, particularly Latin America and the Caribbean, and the 
        poorer parts of Asia and the Pacific, the loss of life is significant 
        and the financial losses seriously damage economies. After the immediate 
        clean-up, there is little funding left to make ravaged areas less vulnerable 
        in the future. Elsewhere, droughts are adding to water stress, already 
        on the increase because of runaway growth in water demand. This shortfall 
        cripples agriculture in many parts of West Asia and Africa, where it directly 
        menaces the very survival of many people and increases regional tensions, 
        and also in North America, where it tips the balance in favour of pursuing 
        risky, large-scale water transfer projects.</p>
      <p>Many sectors bear the mark of developments in the areas of biotechnology 
        and genetic engineering. Difficulties in mastering these new technologies 
        are made worse by a drop in public funding for research and development. 
        Finance for these purposes is now concentrated in the hands of private 
        firms that are biased in favour of those applications that will yield 
        the highest profits. Minimal social and environmental safeguards characterize 
        the early phases of biotechnology development.</p>
      <p>Significant advances are achieved in medicine, agriculture and environmental 
        clean-up technologies, but detrimental side effects also arise. These 
        include accidental releases, illicit use by terrorist groups, epidemics 
        among human and animal populations and negative impacts on various plant 
        species. Attacks on biotechnology trials by eco-terrorists and pro-nature 
        activists further complicate matters. Ultimately, a clampdown on research 
        and application trials is imposed by governments and key firms involved 
        in these fields.</p>
      <p>The net result is a slowdown in advances in those areas with potentially 
        the highest impacts for the broadest section of society, such as the production 
        of food crops. In combination with the deterioration of arable land in 
        many areas, food stocks fall perpetually short in some regions. Cutbacks 
        in foreign assistance have left relief agencies unable to handle many 
        of the resulting crises. In general, conventional forms of development 
        aid decline and poverty rises.</p>

      <p>Little action is taken to alleviate the debt burden of poorer nations. 
        The global economy remains stratified and fails to embrace the billions 
        who are economically and politically marginalized. This split is deepened 
        by institutions of international trade that focus on freeing up markets 
        in developing countries, without also doing so in industrialized regions. 
        The flow of new technology and training from the industrialized countries 
        also declines.</p>
      <p>Not only are the poor excluded from the new economy, but also traditional 
        livelihoods and communities erode as global markets penetrate peripheral 
        regions, seeking cheap labour and control of resources. In poorer countries 
        especially, economies increasingly come under the control of transnational 
        corporations. In parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the 
        Pacific, and Africa, this takeover is very clearly seen in the commercial 
        exploitation of biological resources with little compensation for the 
        majority of the people in these regions.</p>
      <p>The drawdown of fiscal resources of the state treasury in poor countries 
        leads to disintegration of social and civic services. In particular, systems 
        of education, especially higher education, collapse. This deepens the 
        divide between the rich and the poor and exacerbates absolute poverty. 
        Furthermore, as a result of cutbacks in public provision of education, 
        much of the alternative schooling that is available is laden with prejudicial 
        seeds of intolerance and violence.</p>
      <p>As conditions worsen in many places the excluded grow increasingly restive. 
        Many seek their fortunes in exploding mega-cities. The pace of urbanization 
        puts extra strain on already overextended infrastructures, leading to 
        more problems with air pollution and lack of access to clean water and 
        sanitation. Limited economic opportunities in cities foster the growth 
        of organized crime. In an atmosphere of despair, illegal drugs find ready 
        markets. Many of the poor try to migrate to rich countries and rising 
        numbers of them resort to illegal entry. The stream of people on the move 
        grows into a river of the desperate flowing (both within and across national 
        boundaries) towards the wealthy areas. Affluent groups respond with growing 
        xenophobia and oppressive policing of borders. Social polarization spreads 
        and extremists and terrorist groups find ready recruits.</p>
      <p>In this atmosphere of rising social, environmental and economic tension, 
        violence is endemic. Poor countries begin to fragment as civil order collapses 
        and various forms of criminal anarchy fill the vacuum. War and environmental 
        degradation lead to massive movements of refugees in some regions. Environmental 
        changes and overloaded infrastructures also favour another kind of migrant; 
        new and resurgent infectious diseases and the vectors that carry them.</p>
