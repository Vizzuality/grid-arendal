      <p>The Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) has reported that many 
        countries lack adequate legislation and policies for efficient and equitable 
        allocation and use of water resources. Progress is, however, being made 
        with the review of national legislation and enactment of new laws and 
        regulations.</p>
      <p>Concern has also been expressed about the growing incapacity of national 
        hydrological services and agencies, particularly in developing countries, 
        to assess their respective water resources. Many agencies have experienced 
        reductions in observation networks and staff despite increases in water 
        demand. A number of response measures have been undertaken including the 
        World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), which has been implemented 
        in several regions. Its main objective is to contribute to the improvement 
        of national and regional water resource assessment capabilities (CSD 1997b).</p>
      <p>Many different kinds of organizations play a role in water policy decisions, 
        from national governments to local community groups. Over the past decades, 
        however, there has been a growing emphasis on increasing the participation 
        and responsibility of small, local groups and an acknowledgement that 
        communities have an important role to play in water policy.</p>
      <p>The Ministerial Declaration at The Hague in March 2000 (see box below) 
        called for 'Governing water wisely: to ensure good governance, so that 
        the involvement of the public and the interests of all stakeholders are 
        included in the management of water resources' (World Water Forum 2000).</p>
      <p>The private sector has recently begun to expand its role in water management. 
        The 1990s saw a rapid increase in the rate and extent of privatization 
        of previously publicly managed water systems. Private water companies 
        are increasingly serving the needs of growing cities by taking over contracts 
        from public agencies to build, own and operate some or even all of a municipal 
        system. At the same time, concerns have been growing about how best to 
        ensure equitable access to water for the poor, finance projects and share 
        risks.</p>
