      <p><span class="bigchar">T</span>he environment has always been critical 
        to life but concerns over the balance between human life and the environment 
        assumed international dimensions only during the 1950s. In the years that 
        followed, supposedly unconnected pieces of a global jigsaw puzzle began 
        to fit together to reveal a picture of a world with an uncertain future. 
      </p>
      <p>Paradigm-breaking books and articles such as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring 
        (Carson 1962) and Garrett Hardin's 'The Tragedy of the Commons' (Hardin 
        1968) galvanized individual countries and the international community 
        into action. A series of catastrophes added fuel to the environmental 
        fire: thalidomide caused congenital deformations in babies, the Torrey 
        Canyon spilled oil along France's picturesque northern coast, and Swedish 
        scientists charged that the death of fish and other organisms in thousands 
        of the country's lakes resulted from the long-range transport of air pollution 
        from Western Europe. </p>

              commons as a cesspool must be prevented by different means, by coercive 
              laws or taxing devices that make it cheaper for the polluter to

      <p><a name="box2"></a>At the end of the 1960s, the voice of environmental 
        concern was heard almost uniquely in the West. In the communist world, 
        the relentless destruction of the environment in the name of industrialization 
        continued unabated. In developing countries, environmental concerns were 
        regarded as Western luxuries. 'Poverty is the worst form of pollution,' 
        held India's Prime Minister, Indira Ghandi, who played a key role in orienting 
        the agenda of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm 
        in 1972, towards the concerns of the developing countries (Strong 1999). 
        'We hold that of all things in the world, people are the most precious,' 
        said Tang Ke, leader of the Chinese delegation to the Stockholm conference 
        (Clarke and Timberlake 1982). </p>
      <p>In the early 1970s, attention was focused first on the biophysical environment, 
        for example, on issues of wildlife management, soil conservation, water 
        pollution, land degradation and desertification - and people were considered 
        as the root cause of such problems. In the West, there were (and, to some 
        extent, still are) two principal schools of thought about the causes of 
        environmental degradation: one school blamed greed and the relentless 
        pursuit of economic growth; the other blamed population growth. As one 
        commentator put it, 'Unabated pollution and unstabilized population are 
        real threats to our way of life and to life itself' (Stanley Foundation 
        1971). </p>
      <p>These views were encapsulated in the most famous study of the time, the 
        Club of Rome's computer model of the global future which attracted worldwide 
        attention. The Club of Rome was a group of some 50 self-appointed 'wise 
        men' (and women) who met regularly to try to put the world to rights, 
        much as did the Pugwash group of scientists in relation to the Cold War. 
        Published as The Limits to Growth, the Club of Rome model analysed five 
        variables - technology, population, nutrition, natural resources and environment. 
        Its main conclusion was that, if current trends continued, the global 
        system would 'overshoot' and collapse by the year 2000. If that were not 
        to happen, both population and economic growth would have to cease (Meadows 
        and Meadows 1972). Although The Limits to Growth has been heavily criticized, 
        it publicized for the first time the concept of outer limits - the idea 
        that development could be limited by the finite size of the Earth's resources.</p>
