      <p class="global">The unique nature of forest ecosystems has long been acknowledged. 
        Forest ecosystems play multiple roles at global as well as local levels: 
        as providers of environmental services to nature in general - and humans 
        in particular - and as sources of economically valued products (see box). 
        The 1972 Stockholm Conference recognized forests as the largest, most 
        complex and self-perpetuating of all ecosystems, and emphasized the need 
        for sound land and forest use policies, ongoing monitoring of the state 
        of the world's forests and the introduction of forest management planning. 
        It was recommended that countries should:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>strengthen basic and applied research for improved forest planning 
          and management, with emphasis on environmental functions of forests; 
          and</li>
        <li>modernize forest management concepts by including multiple functions 
          and reflecting the cost and benefits of the amenities that forests provide. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The Conference also called for: <br>
      </p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li> cooperation of United Nations bodies to meet the needs for new knowledge 
          to incorporate environmental values in national land use and forest 
          management; and</li>
        <li>continuing surveillance of the world's forest cover through the establishment 
          (in countries) of an appropriate monitoring system.</li>

      <p><a name="fig91"></a>Today, the Stockholm Conference recommendations relating 
        to forests remain valid and unfulfilled, in many ways, because of conflicting 
        interests in managing forests for environmental conservation and economic 
        development. </p>
      <p>Deforestation over the past 30 years has been the continuation of a process 
        with a long history. By the time of the Stockholm Conference, much of 
        the Earth's forest cover had already been cleared. The historic loss of 
        forests is closely related to demographic expansion and the conversion 
        of forest land to other uses. Major direct causes of forest degradation 
        brought on by humans include overharvesting of industrial wood, fuelwood 
        and other forest products, and overgrazing. Underlying causes include 
        poverty, population growth, markets and trade in forest products, and 
        macroeconomic policies. Forests are also susceptible to natural factors 
        such as insect pests, diseases, fire and extreme climatic events.</p>
      <p>A number of assessments of changes in forest cover have been carried 
        out over the past 30 years including FAO and UNEP 1982, FAO 1995, FAO 
        1997, FAO 2001b, UNEP 2001 and WRI 1997). While differing in their definitions 
        of forest cover, methodology and specific results, making detailed comparisons 
        unreliable, these assessments have reinforced each other in their overall 
        depiction of declining forest areas and continued degradation of forest 
        ecosystems. </p>
      <p>The 1980 <i>Tropical Forest Resources Assessment </i>by FAO and UNEP 
        was the first comprehensive assessment of tropical forests. Th e rate 
        of tropical deforestation was calculated at 11.3 million ha a year FAO 
        and UNEP 1982), vindicating the fears of the Stockholm Conference about 
        the alarming rate of global forest loss. Since then, while forest area 
        in developed countries has stabilized and is slightly increasing overall, 
        deforestation has continued in developing countries (FAO-ECE 2000, FAO 
        2001b, FAO 2001a). </p>

      <p><a name="fig92"></a>FAO's <i>Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 
        </i>(FAO 2001b), using for the first time a common definition of forests 
        as areas of at least 0.5 ha with tree crown cover of more that 10 per 
        cent, concluded that:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>The total area covered by forest is approximately 3 866 million ha, 
          almost one-third of the world's land area, of which 95 per cent is natural 
          forest and 5 per cent is planted forest; 17 per cent is in Africa, 19 
          per cent in Asia and the Pacific, 27 per cent in Europe, 12 per cent 
          in North America and 25 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean 
          (see table below). About 47 per cent of forests worldwide are tropical, 
          9 per cent subtropical, 11 per cent temperate and 33 per cent boreal. 
        </li>
        <li>At the global level, the net loss in forest area during the 1990s 
          was an estimated 9.4 million ha (equivalent to 2.4 per cent of total 
          forests). This was the combined effect of a deforestation rate of 14.6 
          million ha per year and a rate of forest increase of 5.2 million ha 
          per year. Deforestation of tropical forests is almost 1 per cent per 
          year. </li>
        <li>The area under forest plantations grew by an average of 3.1 million 
          ha per year during the 1990s. Half of this increase was the result of 
          afforestation on land previously under non-forest land use, whereas 
          the other half resulted from conversion of natural forest.</li>
        <li> The world's natural forests have continued to be converted to other 
          land uses at a very high rate. During the 1990s, the total loss of natural 
          forests (deforestation plus the conversion of natural forests to forest 
          plantations) was 16.1 million ha per year, of which 15.2 million ha 
          occurred in the tropics.</li>
        <li> In the 1990s, almost 70 per cent of deforested areas were changed 
          to agricultural land, predominantly under permanent rather than shifting 
          systems. In Latin America most conversion was large scale, whereas in 
          Africa small-scale agricultural enterprises predominated. Changes in 
          Asia were more equally distributed between permanent large- and small-scale 
          agriculture and areas under shifting cultivation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A recent study using globally comprehensive and consistent satellite 
        data estimated that the extent of the world's remaining closed natural 
        forests (where crown cover is more than 40 per cent) in 1995 was 2 870 
        million ha, about 21.4 per cent of the land area of the world (UNEP 2001). 
        About 81 per cent of these forests are concentrated in just 15 countries. 
        Ranked in the highest to lowest order these are: the Russian Federation, 
        Canada, Brazil, the United States, Democratic Republic of the Congo, China, 
        Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, India, Australia 
        and Papua New Guinea. The first three countries contain about 49 per cent 
        of the remaining closed forests. More than a quarter of closed forests 
        grow on mountains (see <a href="145.htm#box68b">box</a>).</p>
