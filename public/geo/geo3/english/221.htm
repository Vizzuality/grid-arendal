      <p class="global">Global biodiversity is changing at an unprecedented rate 
        (Pimm and others 1995), the most important drivers of this change being 
        land conversion, climate change, pollution, unsustainable harvesting of 
        natural resources and the introduction of exotic species (Sala and others 
        2000). The relative importance of these drivers differs between ecosystems. 
        For example, land conversion is most intensive in tropical forests and 
        less intensive in temperate, boreal and Arctic regions; atmospheric nitrogen 
        deposition is largest in northern temperate areas close to cities; introduction 
        of exotic species is related to patterns of human activity - those areas 
        remote from human intervention generally receive fewer introduced species. 
        The ultimate causes of biodiversity loss are human population growth together 
        with unsustainable patterns of consumption, increasing production of waste 
        and pollutants, urban development, international conflict, and continuing 
        inequities in the distribution of wealth and resources.</p>
      <p class="global">Over the past three decades, decline and extinction of 
        species have emerged as major environmental issues. The current rate of 
        extinction is many times higher than the 'background' rate - that which 
        has prevailed over long periods of geological time. Estimates based on 
        the fossil record suggest that the background extinction rate in mammals 
        and birds has been one species lost every 500-1 000 years (May, Lawton 
        and Stork 1995).</p>
      <p class="global">Information on the conservation status of species is provided 
        by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) which regularly publishes 'Red 
        Lists' of species considered to be threatened with extinction. The latest 
        IUCN Red List (Hilton-Taylor 2000) indicates that about 24 per cent (1 
        130) of mammals and 12 per cent (1 183) of bird species are currently 
        regarded as globally threatened (see table). Since the Red List assessment 
        in 1996, the number of critically endangered species has increased from 
        169 to 180 mammals and from 168 to 182 birds (Hilton-Taylor 2000). Analyses 
        suggest that over the next 100 years the extinction rate of vertebrate 
        groups could be as high as 15-20 per cent (Mace 1995). However, species 
        trends derived from Red List data should be interpreted with caution because 
        the criteria for listing have changed over time and some of the changes 
        in status reflect taxonomic revisions (May, Lawton and Stork 1995).</p>
      <p class="global">Insufficient information is available to determine precisely 
        how many species have become extinct in the past three decades. However, 
        the database maintained by the Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms 
        (CREO 2001) lists 58 fish species and 1 mammal species recorded as extinct 
        since 1970; assessments by BirdLife International indicate that 9 bird 
        species have become extinct during this period (BirdLife International 
        2000).</p>
      <p class="global">Much of the relevant information on the status of species 
        is qualitative or anecdotal, and it is therefore difficult to develop 
        a quantitative overview of global trends. To assess trends in species 
        loss or decline, indicators are required that provide quantitative estimates 
        of change over time, using consistent methodologies for sampling and analysis. 
        Ideally, such indicators should be based on data sampled explicitly for 
        this purpose. Few such monitoring programmes have yet been established.</p>

          <td>The Living Planet Index system is based on estimates of population 
            size of individual wild species available in the scientific literature. 
            The index is calculated as a percentage of the population size estimated 
            at 1970; the mean value of the index is calculated as an average of 
            all the species included in the assessment at each time interval (Groombridge 
            and Jenkins 2000, Loh 2000, UNEP-WCMC 2000). The index has been calculated 
            for the forest, marine and freshwater ecosystems (see graphs). 
            <p>The forest index, based on 319 populations of temperate and tropical 
              species (mostly birds), shows a decline of about 12 per cent during 
              1970-99. The index for temperate species only shows little change 
              over the period (most deforestation here having taken place before 
              the 20th century). The tropical sample shows a downward trend, consistent 
              with the continuing deforestation in many tropical areas.</p>
            <p>The marine index, based on populations of 217 species of marine 
              animals, shows a decline of about 35 per cent in the same period.</p>
            <p>Inland water and wetland species, represented by a sample of 194 
              populations, have declined by 50 per cent. This suggests that inland 
              water ecosystems are more severely degraded than other ecosystem 
              types, a finding consistent with other evidence.</p>

      <p class="global">The impact of decline or loss of species on the provision 
        of environmental services is difficult to evaluate because the relationship 
        between species diversity and ecosystem function is still unclear. Some 
        species are known to play more significant roles than others; these have 
        been termed 'keystone' species - loss of one of these species has a particularly 
        disruptive effect (Vitousek and Hooper 1993). Reductions in the number 
        of species affect the provision of all ecosystem services because resource 
        capture (of energy, water and nutrients) is greater in more diverse systems. 
        Some ecosystems, such as arid and arctic areas, appear to be particularly 
        vulnerable to human impacts. In these systems, relatively few organisms 
        share common ecological roles (UNEP 1995). Species diversity may also 
        play a role in buffering ecosystems against the effects of human activity 
        (UNEP 1995).</p>
      <p class="global">The past three decades have been marked by the emergence 
        of a concerted response to the biodiversity crisis. Civil society, particularly 
        in the form of a hugely diverse and increasingly sophisticated NGO network, 
        has been a major driving force behind this. A trend towards increased 
        stakeholder participation relating to conservation action is evident as 
        illustrated by the emergence of partnerships between NGOs, governments 
        and the private sector.</p>
      <p class="global">A number of international conventions have been developed 
        that deal specifically with conservation ofthreatened species. Among the 
        most notable are the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
        Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and the 1979 Convention on the 
        Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) - or the Bonn 
        Convention - which was developed to conserve terrestrial, marine and migratory 
        bird species throughout their range. Inter-governmental agreements such 
        as the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement - which aims to develop transboundary 
        strategic measures necessary to conserve the network of critical wetland 
        areas on which migratory waterbirds depend - are the primary tools for 
        the implementation of the CMS.</p>
