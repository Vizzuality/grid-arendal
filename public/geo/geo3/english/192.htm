      <p>The downside of forest clearance and degradation has been widely recognized 
        and many governments have implemented forestry legislation and programmes 
        that aim at conservation and afforestation. Some countries are also opting 
        to control the clearance of land outside conservation and protection areas. 
        Logging bans now exist on 10 million ha but have met with mixed success. 
        In countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand, implementation 
        has been inadequate whereas bans in New Zealand and Sri Lanka which have 
        shifted harvesting to alternative sources have proved effective (FAO 2001b). 
        Zero burning policies have been adopted by Thailand and Malaysia. Some 
        countries have introduced economic instruments for the conservation of 
        forest resources. For example, afforestation fees and licences are used 
        in China to strengthen the cultivation, protection and management of forests. 
        In Lao PDR, logging quotas are issued and distributed to the provinces 
        as provincial quotas (ADB 2000b). Government commitment to the protection 
        of forests is best exemplified by the case of Bhutan where, in 1995, it 
        was mandated that the country must keep at least 60 per cent of its total 
        land area under forest cover. </p>
      <p>The region contains 60 per cent of the world's plantation forests. Whilst 
        plantation forests are usually a poor substitute for natural forests in 
        terms of maintaining biodiversity, they can supplement and substitute 
        wood and other supplies from natural forests, thereby reducing pressure 
        on and disruption to the latter. They also perform many of the environmental 
        services of natural forests, including carbon sequestration, watershed 
        protection and land rehabilitation, and they provide income and employment. 
        A number of governments are increasing plantations to reap these benefits 
        (see box). </p>

            <p>The Chinese government began afforestation programmes in the 1970s. 
              Forest coverage increased from 13.9 per cent in 1993 to 17.5 per 
              cent in 2000. By 2001, the total afforested area in China had reached 
              46.7 million ha. Several countries have ambitious plans for the 
              future:</p>
            <ul class="asiapacific" type="disc">
              <li>Viet Nam has set a target to create 5 million ha of additional 
                forest area in the next 10 years;</li>
              <li>the Philippines Master Plan for Forestry has set a target for 
                2.5 million ha to be planted between 1990 and 2015;</li>
              <li>China plans to establish 9.7 million ha of plantations between 
                1996 and 2010; and</li>
              <li>Australia aims to treble its plantation area to 3 million ha 
                by 2020.</li>

      <p>Local community participation in the management of forests has been gaining 
        pace since the late 1970s. In Nepal, regulations for handing over particular 
        forest areas to groups of forest users were drawn up in 1974. Forest users' 
        groups protect, manage, use the forest area, share all benefits among 
        users and possess exclusive rights to forest income (ADB 2000a). Of Nepal's 
        total forestry sector investment, 36 per cent is earmarked for community 
        forestry. In India, Joint Forest Management was introduced in 1990 and 
        about 45 000 village communities in 21 states are involved in managing 
        more than 11 million hectares of degraded forests (MoEF 1999). The community 
        provides any labour required to improve degraded areas and protects the 
        forest while it regenerates. In time the state gains a revitalized forest 
        and the income from selling its products. A portion of the income from 
        selling timber is given to the community in addition to the right to gather 
        non-wood forest products (FAO 2001b) </p>
      <p>In Viet Nam, more than 500 000 ha of wellstocked, national forests have 
        been turned over to local communities, mostly of indigenous people, while 
        in the Philippines a system of Integrated Protected Areas attempts to 
        protect biodiversity and involve communities as stakeholders in managing 
        forests. </p>
      <p>The PICs have also emphasized the establishment of community-based conservation 
        areas but some countries still lack formal legislation or institutionalized 
        programmes prohibiting the cutting of trees and forests outside protected 
        areas. For some PICs, where customary management is still very strong, 
        there are traditional practices that protect areas from land clearance. 
      </p>
      <p>Both Australia and New Zealand are committed to sustainable forest management. 
        These commitments are formalized in Australia's Nation Forest Policy State 
        of 1992 and New Zealand's Resource Management Act of 1991. In both countries 
        the felling of trees and clearing of bush generally requires formal assessment 
        and approval. In New Zealand, more than 99 per cent of annual roundwood 
        harvests came from plantations in 1997 and several forests have received 
        certification through the Forest Stewardship Council (FAO 2001a).</p>
