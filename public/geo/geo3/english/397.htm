      <p>The key atmospheric issues in the Arctic and Antarctic are the depletion 
        of the stratospheric ozone layer, the long-range transport of air pollutants 
        and warming associated with global climate change. These problems are 
        mainly due to anthropogenic activities in other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>Seasonal stratospheric ozone depletion over Antarctica, and more recently 
        over the Arctic, has been one of the major regional environmental concerns 
        since it was noticed in 1985 (Farman and others 1985). The depth, area 
        and duration of the Antarctic ozone hole has steadily increased, reaching 
        an all-time high of around 29 million km<sup>2</sup> in September 2000 
        (WMO 2000, NASA 2001).</p>
      <p>In the Arctic, average yearly stratospheric ozone levels in the 1990s 
        had declined by 10 per cent from the late 1970s, increasing the risk of 
        snow blindness and sunburn.</p>

      <p><a name="fig235"></a>The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer in 
        the polar regions depends primarily on the implementation of the Montreal 
        Protocol on the Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Therefore the 
        efforts of nations to phase out the use of ODS, even though they are located 
        far from the poles, are of the utmost importance (UNEP 2000).</p>
      <p>Natural ecosystems in polar regions have low adaptive capacity and are 
        highly vulnerable to climate change. Climate change is expected to be 
        more extreme in the polar regions than anywhere else (a warming trend 
        of as much as 5ºC over extensive land areas has been noted in the Arctic, 
        although there are some areas in eastern Canada where temperatures have 
        declined) and will probably have major physical, ecological, social and 
        economic impacts in both the Arctic and the Antarctic (IPCC 2001a and 
        b). Whether due to a natural oscillation or global climate change, the 
        atmospheric temperature of Antarctica is undergoing changes. A marked 
        warming trend is evident in the Antarctic peninsula with spectacular loss 
        of ice shelves and an increase in the cover of higher terrestrial vegetation 
        although, as in the Arctic, there are also areas of marked cooling - at 
        the South Pole for example (Neff 1999).</p>
      <p>Climate change is almost certainly responsible for the decrease in extent 
        and thickness of Arctic sea ice, permafrost thawing, coastal erosion, 
        changes in ice sheets and ice shelves, and the altered distribution and 
        abundance of species in polar regions (IPCC 2001a). Other impacts of the 
        warming trend include a recorded 15 per cent increase in Arctic precipitation, 
        increased storm episodes, earlier springs and a later onset of freezing 
        conditions, and decreased marine salinity (AMAP 1997). Permafrost thawing 
        can itself add to climate change problems - for example, emissions of 
        methane from tundra may increase while reductions in the extent of highly 
        reflective snow and ice cover will magnify warming. These effects may 
        continue for centuries, long after greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized, 
        and may cause irreversible impacts on ice sheets, global ocean circulation 
        and sea-level rise (IPCC 2001a).</p>

      <p>Since most industrial countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic 
        is more exposed to anthropogenic air pollution than the Antarctic. Prevailing 
        winds carry polluting substances - including heavy metals, POPs and sometimes 
        radionuclides - into the Arctic where they can stay airborne for weeks 
        or months and be transported over long distances (Crane and Galasso 1999). 
        Over much of the Arctic, levels of certain types of pollutants are so 
        high that they cannot be attributed to sources within the region; they 
        come from much further south.</p>
      <p>Major sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic include fall-out 
        from nuclear tests, releases from nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, and 
        fall-out from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. A significant 
        increase of radioactivity in Arctic indigenous people was registered after 
        the Chernobyl accident, particularly amongst those who consumed significant 
        quantities of foods that concentrate radiocaesium, such as reindeer meat, 
        freshwater fish, mushrooms and berries. The phenomenon was mainly observed 
        in 1986-89 in Norwegian and Swedish Saami and up to 1991 in the indigenous 
        population of the Kola Peninsula, in the Russian Federation. Since then 
        the levels have been gradually falling back towards the pre-accident levels 
        (AMAP 1997).</p>

          <td>Some persistent toxic substances, including POPs and mercury, can

            deposition, they can reenter the atmosphere again and continue their 
            journey, becoming long-distance contaminants. The process can continue 
            until they reach the cooler polar areas where they condense on to 
            particles or snow flakes in the air, which eventually land on the 
            ground. Due to low solubility in water and high solubility in fats, 
            they are easily incorporated into fat-rich polar food webs, and accumulate 
            in biota. Due to the combination of harsh climate conditions with 
            physicochemical properties of persistent toxic substances, the polar 
            regions, the Arctic in particular, create a sink for these substances, 
            which may result in their levels being higher than in the source regions 
            (AMAP 1997). The implementation of the recently adopted Stockholm 
            Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, signed in May 2001, may 
            lead to a reduction in deposition of POPs in the polar regions.</td>

      <p><a name="fig236"></a>Within the Arctic, the Russian Federation's industrial 
        complexes have been a major source of atmospheric pollution. Emissions 
        of sulphur compounds and heavy metals from smelters have caused major 
        forest degradation on the Kola Peninsula and have decreased the number 
        of species in the region. The areas severely affected by air pollution 
        around the Nickel-Pechenga and Varanger smelters increased from around 
        400 km<sup>2</sup> in 1973 to 5 000 km<sup>2</sup> in 1988 (AMAP 1997). 
        Since 1990, emissions from Russian smelters have decreased or stabilized 
        mainly because of the economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>The level of air pollution in the Arctic is so high that 'Arctic haze' 
        has become a major problem. The term was coined in the 1950s to describe 
        an unusual reduction in visibility that the crews of North American weather 
        reconnaissance planes observed during flights in the high latitudes in 
        the Arctic. The haze is seasonal, with a peak in the spring, and originates 
        from anthropogenic sources of emission outside the Arctic. The haze aerosols 
        are mainly sulphurous (up to 90 per cent) originating from coal burning 
        in the northern mid-latitudes, particularly in Europe and Asia. The particles 
        are about the same size as the wavelength of visible light, which explains 
        why the haze is so apparent to the naked eye.</p>
      <p>Improvement in the state of the polar environment depends primarily on 
        policies and measures implemented by people inside and outside of the 
        polar areas. The Arctic countries have taken a number of steps to improve 
        air quality. These include signing the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary 
        Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and the relevant protocols to it, and supporting 
        the development of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. 
        In addition, domestic regulatory measures taken in the United States and 
        Canada have reduced emissions of some POPs, heavy metals and sulphur compounds. 
        Actions to address stratospheric ozone depletion rely on the successful 
        implementation of the Montreal Protocol by all nations (UNEP 2000).</p>
      <p>Given the predicted increase in the global mean temperature, climate 
        change will impose significant pressures on the polar regions in the 21st 
        century. These impacts are likely to be exacerbated by the high vulnerability 
        and low adaptive capacity of polar ecosystems and of some traditional 
        indigenous communities. Despite increasing activity in both the domestic 
        and international arenas, only preliminary steps have been taken to address 
        the problem of global climate change. The main regional challenge is therefore 
        enhancing the potential for adaptation to change that should help mitigate 
        adverse impacts. The Arctic countries have initiated an Arctic Climate 
        Impact Assessment to be completed in 2003. It will be integrated into 
        the regional studies of the IPCC (ACIA 2001).<br clear="all">
