      <p>The direct impacts of agriculture include effects on water quality, land 
        drainage, soil erosion, toxic effects of fertilizers and biocides, and 
        the destruction, degradation and fragmentation of habitat (Hoffmann 2000). 
        This has had a substantial negative impact on biodiversity, and population 
        declines and range contractions have been found to be significantly greater 
        in countries with more intensive agriculture (Donald, Green and Heath 
        2001). In the United Kingdom, 26 species of farmland birds declined significantly 
        during 1968-95, primarily as a result of agricultural intensification 
        (Siriwardena and others 1998).</p>
      <p>Intensive agriculture also often leads to the eutrophication of freshwater 
        habitats, resulting in deoxygenation of water, production of toxins and 
        a general decline in wildlife conservation value (EEA 2001). Some 46 per 
        cent of Ramsar lake sites in Europe have suffered a decline in water quality, 
        largely as a result of eutrophication (EEA 2001). Wetland habitats have 
        also been affected by land reclamation for agriculture. In Spain alone, 
        more than 60 per cent of all inland freshwater wetlands disappeared during 
        a 25-year period (Casado and others 1992).</p>
      <p>Nutrient enrichment also has a significant impact on marine ecosystems, 
        particularly in areas such as the Caspian Sea. Such pollution has increased 
        the frequency of algal blooms in the Adriatic, where they foul fishing 
        gear and beaches, and in the North Sea where in 1988 they caused massive 
        mortalities of farmed salmonid fish (EEA 2001).</p>
      <p>Key trends over the past three decades include the agricultural 'improvement' 
        of low-intensity farmland, which has led to substantial and mostly irreversible 
        loss of habitats through drainage, fertilization and increased stocking 
        densities (Hoffmann 2000). In addition, hedgerows, field verges and grass 
        tracks have been lost as a result of increased field sizes and mechanization. 
        During the 1970s and 1980s, some 27 200 km of hedgerows were lost annually 
        in England and Wales (Barr and others 1993).</p>
      <p>As a result of agricultural mechanization, much of the remaining area 
        of scrub and grassland habitat is now restricted to ground of low agricultural 
        value, such as steep slopes and poor soils (EEA 2001). Agricultural intensification 
        has also resulted in the loss of fallow land and stubble, important habitats 
        for wildlife, particularly birds.</p>
      <p>The importance of agriculture to biodiversity has been recognized in 
        several policy responses. A European Commission Biodiversity Action Plan 
        for Agriculture has been developed as part of EC commitments to the Convention 
        for Biological Diversity (CBD) through the 1998 Biodiversity Strategy 
        (Hoffmann 2000). The plan is designed to help integrate biodiversity targets 
        into relevant policy sectors. Strategic questions relating to agricultural 
        policy are mainly addressed within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 
        and a key element of the Biodiversity Strategy is therefore to incorporate 
        biodiversity objectives into CAP (Hoffmann 2000).</p>
      <p>In Western Europe, more than 22 million ha of agricultural land are covered 
        by some form of agreement to maintain biodiversity and landscapes (EEA 
        2000). This exceeds the target set in the EU's fifth environmental action 
        programme. However, the extent varies - from more than 60 per cent of 
        farms in Austria, Finland and Sweden, to 7 per cent or less in Belgium, 
        Greece, Italy and Spain (EEA 2000). The environmental performance of these 
        schemes is open to doubt since many lack precise objectives and have no 
        monitoring provisions (BirdLife International 1995).</p>
      <p>Since the early 1980s, grassland and heathland habitats have benefited 
        from a shift in agricultural policies. For example, in Germany and Italy 
        the reform of EU policy has released more than 300 000 ha of arable land 
        for conversion to grassland in lowland areas, as part of the 'set-aside' 
        programme. While initially welcomed as an opportunity to increase the 
        ecological values of such areas, 'set-aside' measures can also have negative 
        results - causing people to abandon traditional farming systems and adopt 
        inappropriate forms of forestry or afforestation (Baldock and Long 1987).</p>
