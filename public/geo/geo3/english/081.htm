      <p><span class="bigchar">S</span>tate of the environment (SOE) reporting 
        was introduced in the United States with the enactment of the 1969 National 
        Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); it was made a global activity in the 
        declaration adopted at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment 
        in 1972. In the early years, the focus was on the state of the biophysical 
        environment - land, freshwater, forests and wildlife, for example. People 
        were generally reported as a threat to the environment. But SOE reporting 
        has over the years become more integrated and now takes into account the 
        complex human-environment interactions in assessing and reporting on the 
        changing state of the environment.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, SOE reporting has been established at virtually every level 
        - local, national, sub-regional, regional and global. Many approaches 
        have been used: some focused on media such as land and water, some on 
        sectoral themes such as agriculture and forestry, some on issues such 
        as land degradation and pollution (and some combined these approaches). 
        Other frameworks have included the pressure-stateresponse (PSR) and later 
        the driving force-pressurestate- impact-response (DPSIR). These different 
        approaches have served their purpose but their inherent weakness is a 
        linear approach to complex ecological processes and human-environment 
        interactions. The reports often down played the fact that people not only 
        have an impact on the environment but also that the environment has an 
        impact on people.</p>
      <p>Over time, therefore, a more integrated environmental assessment and 
        reporting framework has emerged; one that aims to show the cause-andeffect 
        of human-nature linkages. It seeks to connect causes (drivers and pressures) 
        to environmental outcomes (state) to activities (policies and decisions) 
        that have shaped the environment over the past three decades, and the 
        impacts such changes now have on people.</p>
      <p>The analysis is first by theme - socio-economic trends, land, forests, 
        biodiversity, freshwater, coastal and marine areas, atmosphere, urban 
        areas and disasters - but the holistic nature of the environment is emphasized 
        where necessary. These thematic issues are analysed from first the global 
        level then at GEO regional level: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, 
        Latin American and the Caribbean, North America, West Asia and the Polar 
        Regions. The global sections highlight many of the major issues under 
        each sector, showing trends over the past three decades. The analysis 
        uses the 1972 Stockholm Conference as the baseline, discussing the evolution 
        of the issue and how the international community has tried to address 
        the problems.</p>
      <p>At the regional level, each region identified for analysis - through 
        various consultation processes - two or three key regional issues under 
        each sector or theme. These issues are discussed in the following pages 
        and are listed in the table opposite. The table highlights common issues 
        across the different regions, showing the global nature of the environmental 
        issues facing the world today. In addition, the table identifies some 
        unique regional differences, which have called for unique regional responses. 
        Throughout the report, region-specific sections and graphics are colour-coded 
        for easy identification (see table for regional colours).</p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" align="right">
        <tr> 
          <td><a href="tab31.htm"><img src="images/tab31s.gif" width="300" height="250" border="0"></a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="sourceText">Note: This table represents the two or three 
            key thematic issues by region which are covered in this chapter. Due 
            to the DPSIR framework used for the analysis, one issue may be covered 
            under two or more themes. For example, forest degradation may be a 
            major driver of biodiversity loss in one region while in another it 
            may be the key issue of concern</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><a name="tab31"></a>Sub-regional differentiation analyses are also provided 
        where appropriate. National level examples are presented to stress certain 
        developments. The ultimate purpose of policy evaluation under integrated 
        assessment is to identify successes and failures in environmental policy 
        development and implementation as guidance for future policy initiatives.</p>
      <p>The analyses are supported with graphics and other illustrations developed 
        using data specially compiled for the GEO-3 30-year assessment period. 
        The data were compiled from many different sources and then, wherever 
        possible, aggregated from national to sub-regional, regional and global 
        levels, making comparisons possible at these different levels. The GEO-3 
        Data Portal, some of the contents of which are available on a CD-ROM available 
        with this report, addressed some of the data issues first identified in 
        <i>GEO-1</i> in 1997: the harmonization of national datasets and acquisition 
        of global datasets.</p>
      <p>This chapter emphasizes integration across regions, between the state 
        of the environment and policy, between the past and future, between thematic 
        areas, and among sectors, for example, environmental, economic, social, 
        and cultural. It also tries to analyse policy (social responses) in relation 
        to specific environmental issues, showing positive and negative policy 
        impacts on the environment and how the environment can drive policy, both 
        retrospectively and proactively. It covers the impacts of public and private 
        sector policies, and regional and global policies, including multilateral 
        environmental agreements. The analysis takes into consideration not only 
        environmental policy but also the impacts of general policies on environmental 
        issues, such as broader social and economic policy trends with environmental 
        repercussions.</p>
      <p>Another important component of this chapter is the use of satellite images 
        to illustrate environmental change over the past 30 years. The images 
        were generated by Landsat, which coincidentally was launched in 1972 - 
        the same year the Stockholm conference was held. The Landsat images, which 
        are placed in one or sometimes two pages at the end of each section, under 
        the rubric 'Our changing environment', highlight environmental changes 
        at different locations in different regions.</p>
