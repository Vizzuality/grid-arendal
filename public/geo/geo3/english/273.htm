      <p>Water development projects during the 20th century have had significant 
        impacts on freshwater ecosystems by eliminating marshes and wetlands, 
        removing water for other uses, altering flows, and contaminating water 
        with industrial and human wastes. In many rivers and lakes, ecosystem 
        functions have been lost or impaired. In some areas, growing water demand 
        has led to reductions in the volume of large rivers, affecting riverine 
        and adjacent coastal areas (CSD 1997a). Reproductive failures and death 
        in various wildlife species, particularly at higher levels in the food 
        chain, have been reported as a result of high withdrawals of water (CSD 
        1997a).</p>
      <p>Wetlands are an important freshwater ecosystem influencing not only species 
        distribution and biodiversity in general but also human settlements and 
        activities. They provide natural flood control, carbon storage, natural 
        water purification, and goods such as fish, shellfish, timber and fibre 
        (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). While information on the real extent 
        of wetlands globally remains unreliable, recent estimates show that they 
        may cover at least 12.8 million km<sup>2</sup> (Finlayson and others 1999). Human 
        activities, including agriculture and settlements, have caused serious 
        damage to freshwater ecosystems and contributed to the loss of about 50 
        per cent of the world's wetlands during the 20th century (Finlayson and 
        others 1999). This damage to ecosystems reduces water quality and quantity, 
        leading to a reduction in the effective availability of water for human 
        use.</p>
      <p>The total area of wetlands lost during the past 30 years is difficult 
        to assess because of paucity of data and lack of accurate global information 
        on the original extent of wetlands (UNDP and others 2000). However, a 
        1992 review of Ramsar sites (wetlands designated as 'important' under 
        the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl 
        Habitat) showed that 84 per cent were either threatened or experiencing 
        ecological changes (Dugan and Jones 1993).</p>
      <p>There has recently been a marked shift in water policy as policy-makers 
        recognize that ecosystems require adequate water supplies to sustain normal 
        functions and biodiversity conservation. Since 1992, new water policies 
        have been developed that address the goal of preserving and allocating 
        water for the environment - a change since the 1972 Stockholm Conference 
        which focused mainly on protecting air and water quality, and paid no 
        attention to water for ecosystems. Although large projects involving dams 
        are becoming less common due to limited sites, rising costs and general 
        opposition, 349 dams more than 60 metres high were under construction 
        in 1998 (UNDP and others 2000, WCD 2000). The remaining large free-flowing 
        rivers are now found only in the tundra regions of North America and the 
        Russian Federation, and in smaller basins in Africa and Latin America. 
        There is now a growing emphasis on increasing wateruse efficiency and 
        increased productivity with the limited resources available (Postel 1997, 
        Postel 1999, Gleick 1998). Throughout the world there are great opportunities 
        to meet human needs with less water by:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li >using existing technology (such as drip irrigation, low-flow toilets, 
          and better industrial processes);</li>
        <li >changing irrigation technology; finding and stopping wasteful leaks;</li>
        <li >changing wasteful practices (such as irrigating during the day, using 
          potable water for landscape irrigation);</li>
        <li >charging proper prices for water; and</li>
        <li >changing human activities (shifting to more waterefficient crops, 
          changing industrial processes away from water-intensive production).</li>
      </ul>
