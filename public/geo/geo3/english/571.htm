      <p><a name="fig380a"></a>As a predominant emitter of greenhouse gases, North 
        America plays a major role in determining the future climate of the planet. 
        In <i>Markets First </i>the region's refusal to participate notably hampers 
        international efforts to control emissions of these gases. The region 
        remains the highest emitter on a per person basis and also among the highest 
        in absolute terms (see chart). This happens despite overall improvements 
        in energy efficiency stimulated by increasing fuel prices and general 
        technological advance. Transportation-related emissions show the sharpest 
        increase as motor fuel gains a greater share of total energy consumption, 
        pushing up total emissions as it does so. The collapse of parts of the 
        transport infrastructure and the growing restriction of ownership of fossil-fuel-powered 
        vehicles to the elite in <i>Security First </i>are not enough to counteract 
        the overall impacts of expanding population, resulting in even greater 
        increases in emissions in this scenario.</p>
      <p>In a world of <i>Policy First</i>, North America's success in implementing 
        policies to reduce carbon emissions in an economically efficient manner 
        leads to reductions in the region's contribution to global emissions. 
        Nevertheless, emissions per person remain relatively high, at over twice 
        the world average. Emissions from transport and other sources decline 
        through a combination of increased fuel efficiency and greater use of 
        public transport. Even more spectacular results are seen in a world of 
        <i>Sustainability First </i>as greenhouse gas emissions plummet, a goal 
        thought to be unrealistic just a few decades earlier. This transformation 
        is due to technological advances, but more importantly to changes in lifestyle 
        reflected in reductions in per person energy use to the point where it 
        is only slightly higher than that in other developed countries.</p>

      <p><a name="fig380b"></a>One of the most visible impacts of reliance on 
        the automobile is urban sprawl - low urban population densities with heavy 
        reliance on personal transport. The dominance of the automobile culture 
        is also a major factor in local air pollution. These issues continue to 
        plague many cities in the region in both <i>Markets First </i>and <i>Security 
        First</i>. In the <i>Markets First </i>scenario, the built-up area expands 
        over time (see chart), continuing an upward trend in the region, albeit 
        more slowly than in the past. Combined with rising population, the built 
        environment per person expands significantly.</p>
      <p>In <i>Security First</i>, faster population increase and sprawling settlements 
        lead to even greater growth in built-up areas. Here, the sprawling urban 
        spaces that are the legacy of the 20th century are further burdened with 
        a decaying infrastructure. Waste treatment declines steeply and water-borne 
        diseases spread. Populations also rise in the <i>Policy First </i>scenario, 
        but a tendency towards more compact settlements stabilizes the built-up 
        area. In <i>Sustainability First</i>, the values of the scenario are reflected 
        in much more compact settlements than in the past, or in the other scenarios. 
        Combined with relatively smaller populations, the builtup area declines 
        as the scenario unfolds.</p>
      <p>A <i>Policy First </i>world sees the built-up environment creating less 
        pressure on land resources and ecosystems (see chart below). More effort 
        is put into repairing ageing infrastructure, particularly in the inner 
        cities. In Canada, large land areas continue to be set aside for indigenous 
        people, with likely positive future outlook for many of the ecosystems 
        involved. However, very extensive mining, hydropower, oil and gas development 
        projects, along with forest road construction continue to reduce wilderness 
        areas. In <i>Security First </i>and <i>Markets First</i>, exploration 
        processes increase substantially, not least in Alaska, Yukon and Quebec, 
        although these inroads are slightly smaller in the former scenario due 
        to lower economic growth.</p>

      <p><a name="fig381"></a>Going further in a world of <i>Sustainability First</i>, 
        the great urban centres of North America begin a slow process of reorganization 
        in response to the popular desire for greater proximity of home, work, 
        commerce and leisure activity. For many, the 'towns within cities' that 
        begin to emerge from the process by 2032 provide an attractive balance 
        between access to a lively culture and the immediacy of a small community. 
        Others opt for greater access to green spaces, leading to small towns 
        dispersed around larger metropolitan centres, connected by advanced transport 
        systems.</p>
      <p>Continued advances in information technology expand the options for living 
        and working arrangements and a diverse range of lifestyle choices emerges. 
        A common feature of most of these lifestyles is that they are far less 
        resource intensive, automobile-dependent and stressful than their 20th 
        century antecedents. People enjoy a strong sense of affiliation with their 
        local, national and global communities.</p>
      <p>Climatic change and the introduction of exotic species pose additional 
        threats to land-based biodiversity in the region. Although natural forest 
        area remains relatively constant in the region in all scenarios, in some 
        cases there is swift expansion of plantations, built areas and agricultural 
        land, with associated infrastructure. This is particularly the case under 
        the <i>Markets First </i>scenario with its strong economic growth. The 
        diverse biota found in wetlands also continues to be threatened by conversion 
        and degradation of these ecosystems.</p>

      <p><a name="fig382a"></a>Natural vegetation in much of the region, particularly 
        in the north, is threatened by changes in climate. There are slightly 
        greater impacts of climate change in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>scenarios, reflecting the short-term effects of efforts to reduce 
        other pollutants, especially sulphur dioxide, in addition to greenhouse 
        gases. However, over the next 30 years the climate change situation is 
        dominated by the momentum built up before 2002 and there is little overall 
        difference in Natural Capital Index between the scenarios (see chart). 
        The full effects of climate change will be apparent only after 2032.</p>
      <p>Biodiversity in coastal and marine ecosystems also faces threats from 
        infrastructure development, pollution and climate change. In the cases 
        of <i>Sustainability First </i>and <i>Policy First</i>, the slower growth 
        in infrastructure and significant changes in agricultural policy lead 
        to important reductions in land-based sources of pollution. The effects 
        of climatic changes lag somewhat behind those on landbased biodiversity, 
        because of the slower changes in water temperature, but significant threshold 
        effects may play a role here. In fisheries, greater cooperation both within 
        the region and with other regions in <i>Policy First </i>and <i>Sustainability 
        First </i>contributes to the preservation and restoration of important 
        fish stocks. Some of the pressure on marine resources is reduced by the 
        expansion of aquaculture in these scenarios, as well as in <i>Markets 
        First</i>. The potential for international conflicts over marine resources 
        within the region and with other regions is high in <i>Security First</i>, 
        with negative implications for the health of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
