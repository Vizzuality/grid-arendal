      <p>The best known hydrometeorological event is the El Niño phenomenon, the 
        impacts of which can be severe. For example, after the El Niño of 1983, 
        Peru's GDP fell by 12 per cent, mostly because of a reduction in agricultural 
        output and fishery. The national economy took a decade to recover. Damage 
        in the Andean Community countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and 
        Venezuela) due to the 1997/98 El Niño was estimated at more than US$7 
        500 million (CEPAL 1999). </p>

            <p>Cyclical temperature and rainfall variations associated with El 
              Niño are particularly important since they can favour the development 
              and proliferation of vectors of epidemic diseases such as malaria, 
              dengue fever, yellow fever and bubonic plague (WHO 1999). In South 
              America, the most severe outbreaks of malaria generally occur a 
              year after the beginning of an El Niño event, whether associated 
              with an increase in rainfall (as in 1983 in Bolivia, Ecuador and 
              Peru) or with a reduction in rainfall and run-off (as in Colombia 
              and Venezuela).</p>
            <p>A similar link has been suggested between the warming of superficial 
              oceanic waters by El Niño, the proliferation of marine algae, and 
              the appearance of cholera in South America in 1992. The impact of 
              extremes in precipitation (both too much and too little) is also 
              important in the transmission of water-borne diseases such as cholera, 
              gastrointestinal infections and various types of diarrhoea. There 
              were outbreaks of cholera in 1997-98 in Honduras, Nicaragua and 
              Peru related to the increase in precipitation, associated with El 
              Niño (WHO 1999, PAHO 1998).</p>

      <p>Most countries in Central America and the Caribbean are within the hurricane 
        belt, on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Hurricane Mitch, which 
        struck the region in 1998, affecting mostly Honduras and Nicaragua, killed 
        more than 17 000 people and left three million homeless with damage estimated 
        at US$3 000 million. The hurricane also caused fatalities and serious 
        environmental and economic damage in Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El 
        Salvador and Guatemala (CRED-OFDA 2002).</p>
      <p>The 1999 floods on the northern coast of Venezuela also had a strong 
        impact, with damage estimated at more than US$ 3 200 million or 3.3 per 
        cent of the country's GDP (World Bank 2000). In the state of Vargas, the 
        hardest-hit area, more than 230 000 jobs were lost. The state of Miranda 
        was also badly hit: the El Guapo dam collapsed, causing water shortages 
        and 60 per cent of crops were reported lost (MoPD Venezuela 2000). It 
        is estimated that there were 30 000 deaths, 30 000 families left homeless 
        and more than 81 000 dwellings destroyed (IFRC 2002). </p>

            <p>The series of earthquakes that shook El Salvador in early 2001 
              began with one of 7.6 on the Richter scale that was initially considered 
              an isolated event. However, it was only part of a series that spanned 
              weeks and demonstrated the complex social and ecological implications 
              of such events. Besides the loss of life and infrastructure during 
              the original series of earthquakes, there has been a long-lasting 
              impact on people and ecosystems. For example, the artisanal fishery 
              lost an essential part of its docking infrastructure as well as 
              service infrastructure for processing fish and transporting it to 
              the market on land. A total of 30 772 farms were damaged and farmers 
              were forced to wait for three months for the rains because they 
              did not have the funds to repair their damaged irrigation systems. 
              The destruction of 20 per cent of the country's coffee processing 
              plants severely affected the jobs and income of thousands of rural 
              families in a country that was also affected by Hurricane Fifi in 
              1974, civil conflict between 1978 and 1992, the 1986 earthquake 
              and Hurricane Mitch in 1998.</p>
