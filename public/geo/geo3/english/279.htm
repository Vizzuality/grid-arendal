      <p><a name="fig159"></a>Some 62 per cent of Africans had access to an improved 
        water supply in 2000. Even so, rural Africans spend much time searching 
        for water and 28 per cent of the global population without access to improved 
        water supplies live in Africa. Women are particularly affected as they 
        are often responsible for the family's water needs. Urban areas are better 
        supplied, with 85 per cent of the population having access to improved 
        water supplies. In rural areas, the average is 47 per cent, with 99 per 
        cent of the rural population in Eritrea having no sanitation coverage. 
        The total African population with access to improved sanitation was 60 
        per cent in 2000. Again, urban populations fared better, with an average 
        84 per cent having improved sanitation compared to an average 45 per cent 
        in rural areas (WHO and UNICEF 2000). </p>
      <p>Poor water supply and sanitation lead to high rates of water-related 
        diseases such as ascariasis, cholera, diarrhoea, dracunculiasis, dysentery, 
        eye infections, hookworm, scabies, schistosomiasis and trachoma. About 
        3 million people in Africa die annually as a result of water-related diseases 
        (Lake and Souré 1997). In 1998, 72 per cent of all reported cholera cases 
        in the world were in Africa. </p>
      <p>Poor water supply and sanitation lead to contamination of surface and 
        groundwater, with subsequent effects on plant, animal and human communities. 
        The economic costs can be high. In Malawi, for example, the total cost 
        associated with water degradation was estimated at US$2.1 million in 1994 
        (DREA Malawi 1994). These costs included the need for water treatment, 
        the development of human resources and reduced labour productivity. Meeting 
        basic water and sanitation needs is also expensive. In Nigeria, a recent 
        study estimates the future cost of water supply and environmental sanitation 
        to be US$9.12 billion during 2001-10 (Adedipe, Braid and Iliyas 2000). 
      </p>
      <p>Governments are trying to improve the situation with environmental management 
        policies that include waste management and urban planning, and by making 
        environmental impact assessments compulsory for large projects. One of 
        the major regional policy initiatives was the 1980 Lagos Plan of Action, 
        which urged member states to formulate master plans in the sectors of 
        water supply and agriculture (OAU 1980). The Plan was influenced by the 
        1977 United Nations Water Conference's Mar del Plata Action Plan and the 
        1978 African regional meeting on water-related issues. Despite these initiatives, 
        a lack of human and financial resources, and equipment for implementation 
        and enforcement, still limit progress.</p>

            <p>A study launched in Cairo in 1995 has shown that wastewater treatment 
              can address not only the Egyptian city's water pollution problems 
              but also open new opportunities for business and agriculture. The 
              Greater Cairo Wastewater Project will produce about 0.4 million 
              tonnes of sludge or biosolids annually from wastewater treatment.</p>
            <p>The study was initiated under the Mediterranean Environmental Technical 
              Assistance Programme funded by the European Investment Bank and 
              promoted by the Cairo Wastewater Organization. Initial results show 
              that sludge can be effective in growing wheat, berseem clover, forage 
              maize and grape vines. Digested sludge offers significant nitrogen 
              fertilizer replacement value to farmers; no harmful effects of biosolids 
              on crops were detected in field trials; and the benefits of spreading 
              biosolids on newly reclaimed soils are expected to increase with 
              cumulative applications. Farmers in Egypt are prepared to pay for 
              bio-solids due to the scarcity of manure and the high costs of inorganic 
              fertilizers.</p>
