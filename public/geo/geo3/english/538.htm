      <p>As the world looks back after three decades, there are mixed feelings. 
        Much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. Although not 
        all the longrange targets have yet been achieved, the world is on a fair 
        trajectory to meet them. It is clear, though, that there are significant 
        differences in progress on the different goals and in different regions.</p>

      <p>There has been broad success in reducing extreme poverty, achieving universal 
        primary education, improving gender equity, reducing infant and child 
        mortality and improving reproductive health. International debt relief 
        has contributed to the funding required to meet these targets in many 
        developing countries. Areas of concern remain, including much of Africa, 
        where 10 per cent of the population go hungry in most sub-regions. But 
        even this represents reductions of two-thirds to three-quarters over the 
        30-year period. Similarly, the more technology-dependent environmental 
        targets - increases in materials use efficiency and reductions in the 
        releases of toxic materials - have proved to be achievable.</p>
      <p>A key role has been played by the private sector, which has accepted 
        major responsibility and ploughed more profits back into research and 
        development and into global and regional business coalitions. These new 
        groupings have actively supported technology transfer to developing countries. 
        The effect of private sector initiatives is further reflected in the achievement 
        of such goals as improving urban air quality and providing access to safe 
        water.</p>
      <p>For the goals related to water stress, land degradation, deforestation 
        and marine overfishing, significant though costly advances have been made, 
        but considerable risks remain. Growing (although stabilizing) populations 
        and improving lifestyles continue to intensify demands for water, food, 
        forest resources and space. Changes in climate have contributed to these 
        concerns. Whilst the percentage of the population living in areas of high 
        and severe water stress remains stable, the total number of persons potentially 
        affected has risen.</p>

      <p>Crises have been prevented through expensive infrastructural developments 
        and pricing policies, which place a greater financial burden on end users. 
        The amount of land at risk from water-induced soil degradation has risen 
        significantly due to agricultural expansion into marginal lands and climate 
        changes. But the rate at which degradation is actually taking place has 
        fallen substantially over the period as farmers have implemented more 
        stringent land conservation measures in response to changing tax and subsidy 
        structures. By 2032 there is almost no net advance of degradation.</p>
      <p>There has been success in halting deforestation. Total forest area has 
        even increased in most regions, in part because the area under plantations 
        has expanded. However, the level of exploitation of forests has continued 
        to increase. Similarly, growth in aquaculture and better management of 
        fishery systems (including stricter controls on marine fish catches) have 
        prevented further decline in most fish stocks, but overall exploitation 
        has not fallen significantly.</p>
      <p>Finally, the scale and nature of the efforts needed to address climate 
        change and biodiversity decline have proved to be enormous. Emissions 
        of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases per unit of economic activity 
        have fallen significantly throughout the world and absolute levels have 
        fallen in the wealthier regions. More rapid economic development and continued 
        population growth in other regions have resulted in higher absolute emissions, 
        even though per capita emissions in these regions remain relatively low. 
        The net result is a continuing rise in global emissions.</p>
      <p>Atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> continue to climb, indicating 
        that much more stringent measures will be required in the future to bring 
        them back down to the target levels. Global temperatures have risen by 
        nearly 0.75°C since the turn of the century and continue to increase, 
        although models indicate that, as reductions already negotiated take effect, 
        this rate of increase has reached a plateau and will begin to decline 
        in a few decades. The regional manifestations of climate change and the 
        infrastructure development that has taken place to meet growing human 
        needs and to achieve the other goals have placed many human and natural 
        systems at increased risk.</p>
      <p>In summary, the forces driving the world in unsustainable directions, 
        while not necessarily defeated, appear to be on the way to being tamed. 
        Not all the alarming trends have been reversed, though even in the worst 
        cases 'things are getting worse at a slower rate' (Meadows 2000). The 
        actions that have been required to keep the world on track to meet the 
        long-term goals have not always been popular and have often been expensive. 
        Halting deforestation, land degradation and marine overfishing has required 
        drastic measures, at times including total bans on human activity in some 
        areas.</p>
      <p>Efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases have required fairly 
        high levels of taxation on most energy sources and certain industrial 
        chemicals, as well as expensive shifts in agricultural practices. There 
        is a question as to how much more can be accomplished with similar policies, 
        even given fresh technological advances. There is also a question mark 
        over how long businesses and the general public will carry on accepting 
        such policies. Without fundamental changes in human behaviour and demands, 
        the achievement of sustainability could well mean an ever more managed, 
        bureaucratic, technocratic and ultimately dehumanized world.</p>

            in their immediate surroundings but they exclude the disadvantaged

      <p>In the early years of the century, a world view that puts market principles 
        and security concerns to the fore, dominates global development. This 
        is reflected at international level in the half-hearted mood of debates 
        at the WSSD and similar meetings. Negotiations on climate change and other 
        multilateral environmental agreements drag on with minimal progress.</p>
      <p>Where there are advances at international level, these tend to be in 
        areas with a more economic focus, such as international trade and foreign 
        investment. Even in this arena, promising initiatives like the Global 
        Compact for Business, the Global Reporting Initiative and the Doha round 
        of trade negotiations under the WTO, are slow to deliver on their promises 
        to create the basis for more equitable and sustainable economic globalization.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States and the 
        initial armed response in Afghanistan, the emphasis is on providing security 
        by more traditional means, such as military power and control of arms 
        and financial flows. Little attention is paid to the social and environmental 
        issues that many argue provide the motivation for terrorist activity.</p>
