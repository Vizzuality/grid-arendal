      <p>Although climatic variability is a natural phenomenon, the increasing 
        frequency and severity of extreme events can be in part attributed to 
        human activities such as deforestation and inappropriate management of 
        land and water resources. For example, clearing of tropical forests in 
        Central and Western Africa has altered the local climate and rainfall 
        patterns, and increased the risk of drought. Clearing of vegetation may 
        also increase run-off and soil erosion. Damming of rivers and draining 
        of wetlands reduces the environment's natural ability to absorb excess 
        water, enhancing the impacts of floods. For example, countries in Southern 
        Africa experienced devastating floods in 1999 and 2000 which affected 
        more than 150 000 families (Mpofu 2000). Degradation of wetlands such 
        as the Kafue wetlands in Zambia, damming of rivers, deforestation and 
        overgrazing lowered the environment's ability to absorb excess water and 
        magnified the impact of the floods (Chenje 2000, UNDHA 1994).</p>

            <p>Environmental rehabilitation of refugee camps in Africa alone could 
              cost as much as US$150 million a year. Visible evidence of environmental 
              degradation is most obvious in long-standing asylum countries such 
              as Kenya and Sudan. Land surrounding the refugee camps has been 
              stripped clean of trees and vegetation. In such situations, refugees 
              may have to walk up to 12 km in search of water and firewood.</p>
            <p>In the early 1990s, an estimated 20 000 ha of woodlands were cut 
              each year in Malawi to provide firewood and timber for the various 
              camps hosting Mozambican refugees, while in 1994, at the height 
              of the refugee crisis near the Virunga National Park in the Democratic 
              Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), refugees were removing some 
              800 tonnes of timber and grass each day from the park - an amount 
              far in excess of a possible sustainable yield. Despite efforts to 
              restrict the impact on the park, almost 113 km<sup>2</sup> have 
              been affected, of which more than 71 km<sup>2</sup> have been completely 
              deforested. At another site in South Kivu, almost 38 km<sup>2</sup> 
              of forest were lost within three weeks of the arrival of refugees. 
              In December 1996, more than 600 000 refugees from Burundi and Rwanda 
              were housed in the Kagera region in northwest Tanzania. More than 
              1 200 tonnes of firewood were consumed each day - a total of 570 
              km<sup>2</sup> of forest were affected, of which 167 km<sup>2</sup> 
              were severely deforested.</p>

      <p>Over the past three decades, millions of Africans have sought refuge 
        from natural and human-made disasters with both environmental and socio-economic 
        impacts. At the end of 2000, there were 3.6 million refugees in Africa, 
        56 per cent of whom were under 18 years of age (UNHCR 2001b). Often refugees 
        are settled in fragile ecosystems where they exert considerable pressure 
        on the natural resources, as they have no other means of survival (see 
        box). Refugee populations also sometimes experience further conflicts 
        with neighbouring communities, through competition for resources.</p>
