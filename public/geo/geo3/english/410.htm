      <p>While the majority (62.1 per cent ) of the African population is still 
        rural, urban growth rates at nearly 4 per cent a year are the most rapid 
        in the world, and nearly twice the global average (United Nations Population 
        Division 2001). Growth rates are predicted to average 3.5 per cent per 
        year over the next 15 years, meaning that Africa's share of the world's 
        urban population will increase from 10 to 17 per cent between 2000 and 
        2015 (United Nations Population Division 2001).</p>
      <p>North Africa is the most urbanized sub-region with an average urban population 
        of 54 per cent, followed by West Africa (40 per cent), Southern Africa 
        (39 per cent), Central Africa (36 per cent) and the Western Indian Ocean 
        islands (32 per cent). The least urbanized sub-region is Eastern Africa 
        with only 23 per cent of the population living in urban areas (United 
        Nations Population Division 2001). Malawi has the highest urban growth 
        rate of any country in Africa, which at 6.3 per cent is three times the 
        world rate.</p>
      <p>Not only are there more people living in cities but the cities themselves 
        are becoming larger, and more numerous. There are now 43 cities in Africa 
        with populations of more than one million inhabitants, a figure which 
        is expected to increase to almost 70 by 2015 (United Nations Population 
        Division 2001).</p>

      <p>Africa's high urban growth rate is a result of ruralurban migration, 
        population growth and, in some areas, conflict. People leave rural areas 
        because of declining agricultural productivity, lack of employment opportunities 
        and lack of access to basic physical and social infrastructure. The expectation 
        of higher incomes and standards of living in urban areas is seldom realized, 
        however, and urban poverty is widespread and growing. In Moroni, Comoros, 
        40 per cent of the population lives in poverty (RFIC 1997), and in Southern 
        Africa up to 45 per cent of urban households grow crops or raise livestock 
        in urban environments in order to supplement their livelihoods (UNDP 1996). 
        Environmental disasters and conflicts have also caused many people to 
        flee rural areas and seek refuge in urban centres. In Mozambique, about 
        4.5 million rural people were displaced to urban areas due to civil strife 
        in the 1980s (Chenje 2000), while the third largest settlement in Sierra 
        Leone is a displaced persons camp (UNCHS 2001b).</p>

              <li>A series of urban upgrading projects have been under way in 
                Ghana since 1985, in one of the most extensive efforts in Africa. 
                By 2000, these had improved infrastructure and services for nearly 
                half a million people in five cities (United Nations Population 
                Division 2001).</li>
              <li>Safer Cities Dar es Salaam is a programme initiated by NGOs 
                and CBOs in 1998 to create awareness and build capacity in crime 
                prevention. Activities include job creation, organizing community 
                security groups and analysing crime statistics. The programme 
                has since been replicated in Abidjan, Antananarivo, Dakar, Durban, 
                Johannesburg and Yaounde (UNCHS 2001b).</li>
              <li>In 1997, South Africa built more than 200 low-cost housing units 
                with environmentally friendly features such as dual flush toilets 
                and passive solar energy design to minimize the energy needed 
                for heating and cooling. The units initially accommodated athletes 
                to the All Africa Games but were later allocated to residents 
                of Alexandria, one of Johannesburg's worst slums (Everatt 1999).</li>

      <p>Because of slow economic growth in many African countries, lack of sound 
        development policies and an increasing number of small households, infrastructure 
        development has been unable to keep pace with the burgeoning need for 
        shelter and services for growing urban populations. As a result, many 
        African cities have an increasing number of overcrowded, informal settlements, 
        or 'shanty towns', characterized by inadequate housing and poor provision 
        of infrastructure such as roads, street lights, water supplies, sanitation 
        and waste management services. Often these settlements are developed on 
        fragile environments such as steep slopes, natural drainage waterways 
        and flood-prone areas. Inadequate housing and settlement design can also 
        contribute to declining security and increasing levels of crime in African 
        cities (Shaw and Louw 1998).</p>
      <p>Governments and authorities have attempted to meet the demand for housing 
        and services through increased construction. South Africa, for example, 
        has produced more than one million low-cost houses during the past six 
        years (DoH South Africa 2000). However, lack of awareness of resource-efficient 
        construction practices has resulted in excessive use of natural resources 
        and generation of large amounts of construction waste that is rarely recycled 
        (Macozoma 2000). In addition, new settlements have mostly been on open 
        land on the urban periphery rather than on little used land within the 
        cities, thus requiring expansion of infrastructure rather than more intensive 
        use of existing networks. Attention is now shifting to integrated development 
        planning, and housing policies that support environmentally sustainable 
        housing have been developed in some countries.</p>
      <p>Key environmental issues in urban areas in Africa are related to the 
        provision of services for waste, water and sanitation, and urban air pollution.</p>
