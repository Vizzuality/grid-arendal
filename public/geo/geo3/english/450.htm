      Until the 1970s, the international community considered disasters as exceptional 
      circumstances, when local coping capacities were exhausted and external 
      emergency relief was required. The term disaster management was generally 
      equivalent to disaster response and tended to be within the exclusive competence 
      of organizations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies or national 
      civil defence institutions. 
      <p>In 1971, the United Nations Disaster Relief Office, now the United Nations 
        Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), was established 
        to mobilize and coordinate relief activities from all sources in times 
        of disaster. The concept of disaster preparedness was developed during 
        the 1970s and 1980s, and included training and some cross-sectoral activities 
        to increase capacity for rescue, relief and rehabilitation during and 
        after a disaster. But even the most pessimistic forecasts could not have 
        foreseen the upward spiral in negative socio-economic consequences of 
        natural disasters in the closing decades of the 20th century.</p>

            <p>The Chinese government is shifting the focus of its disaster policies 
              from improving response capabilities to reducing hazards and risks. 
              During the past ten years, national coordination has been vested 
              in the Chinese National Committee (CNC) for the IDNDR, an inter-ministerial 
              organization composed of representatives from 28 ministries, departments 
              and commissions. Since 1989, CNC has been working on the National 
              Natural Disaster Reduction Plan of the People's Republic of China 
              (1998- 2010). It has also helped to develop and coordinate policies 
              and plans for national and local disaster reduction activities.</p>
            <p>Motivated by the seriousness of the 1991 floods in China, the Chinese 
              authorities recognized the need 'to integrate disaster reduction 
              into the comprehensive plan for national economy and social development'. 
              The Chinese National Centre for Natural Disaster Reduction has now 
              been established within the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The centre 
              compiles and analyses data on disasters, and passes the results 
              to the State Council for decision-making responsibilities.</p>
            <p>China experienced its worst floods in more than 100 years in 1999, 
              which affected more than 300 million people. The floods galvanized 
              more political commitment for the integration of risk and disaster 
              prevention programmes into national social and economic planning. 
              However, China believes that there were fewer losses during the 
              1999 floods in the Yangtze River Valley, despite higher water levels, 
              because of the US$7.6 billion invested in water conservancy measures 
              since the costly 1998 floods.</p>

      <p>The 1990s was declared the International Decade for Natural Disaster 
        Reduction (IDNDR), one of the principal goals of which was to inculcate 
        a culture of disaster prevention through the wider application of known 
        scientific and technological mechanisms by a better-informed population. 
        In the words of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 'We must, 
        above all, shift from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. 
        The humanitarian community does a remarkable job in responding to disasters. 
        But the most important task in the medium and long-term is to strengthen 
        and broaden programmes which reduce the number and cost of disasters in 
        the first place. Prevention is not only more humane than cure, it is also 
        much cheaper' (IDNDR 1999b). The IDNDR successfully placed risk reduction 
        higher on the political agenda, as well as setting out a number of priorities 
        to be undertaken by countries and regions in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>An increasing number of governments and international organizations are 
        promoting risk reduction as the only sustainable solution for reducing 
        the social, economic and environmental impacts of disasters. Risk reduction 
        strategies include:</p>
      <ul class="global">
        <li>vulnerability mapping;</li>
        <li>identification of areas that are safe for settlement and development;</li>
        <li>adoption of building codes based on disaster resilient engineering 
          and on local hazard risk assessments; and</li>
        <li class="global"><span class="global">enforcing these plans and codes 
          by economic and other incentives.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the global level, the UN has established an International Strategy 
        for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), a global platform aimed at helping all 
        communities to become resilient to the effects of natural disasters and 
        to proceed from protection against hazards to the management of risk through 
        the integration of risk prevention into sustainable development. The strategy 
        - based on the IDNDR experience and developments such as the 1994 Yokohama 
        Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World and the 1999 Strategy 'A 
        Safer World in the 21st Century: Disaster and Risk Reduction' - reflects 
        a cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary approach to disaster reduction.</p>

            <p>The fundamental goal of the UNEP disaster management programme 
              is to reinforce the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster 
              management. The other cornerstone is the adoption of preventive 
              strategies and practical measures to reduce the potential loss of 
              human lives and property, as well as destruction of the environment.</p>
            <p>The success of this approach depends on increasing public awareness 
              of the risks that natural, technological and environmental hazards 
              pose to societies, and on educating people about the value of existing 
              approaches for prevention and preparedness. UNEP contributes to 
              this process through its programmes on environmental law, early 
              warning and assessment, and Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies 
              at Local Level (APELL).</p>
            <p>UNEP's APELL programme, developed in conjunction with governments 
              and industry, recognizes that the incidence and effects of environmental 
              disasters can be reduced by prevention and preparedness initiatives 
              at the local level. The APELL concept has been successfully introduced 
              to more than 30 countries and in more than 80 industrial communities 
              worldwide. The UNEP strategy includes the promotion of cleaner production 
              processes and technologies, and helping countries establish cleaner 
              production centres.</p>
            <p>A major objective of the UNEP early warning and assessment programme 
              is to evaluate the increasing vulnerability of human society due 
              to widespread environmental and climatic change in order to emphasize 
              the need for sound integrated environmental management, and to provide 
              early warning of emerging threats for preparedness and response.</p>

      <p>Implementation of the strategy, which is based on the establishment of 
        partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, 
        the scientific community and other stakeholders in the disaster reduction 
        community, is an integral part of efforts aimed at promoting the overall 
        goal of sustainable development. It is also an indispensable element in 
        the search for solutions designed to counter the increasing threat posed 
        by natural hazards (ISDR 1999).</p>
