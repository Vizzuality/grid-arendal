      <p>Old growth forests, which are characterized by stands of large and old 
        trees, a distinct species composition, a multilayered canopy, and a large 
        build up of organic matter (Lund 2000), have many positive attributes. 
        They are a source of high-value timber, contain large amounts of carbon, 
        harbour a large reservoir of genetic diversity, provide habitat for many 
        species, regulate hydrological regimes, protect soils and conserve nutrients, 
        and have substantial recreational and aesthetic value (Marchak, Aycock 
        and Herbert 1999). Much of the interest in old growth forests stems from 
        the powerful images which they project of rich biodiversity and timeless 
        stability. Visitors often sense a form of spirituality and grandeur in 
        such forests and most people place a high value on them.</p>
      <p>Old growth forests once occurred in all North American ecosystems although 
        it is now difficult to determine their exact extent. Remnant old growth 
        forests and stands still remain, especially in the Pacific Northwest and 
        down the Pacific coast to California. The classic old growth forest in 
        this area contains redwoods, cedars, Douglas fir, hemlock and spruce. 
        The region probably still contains about half the world's remaining unlogged 
        coastal temperate rainforest, with the greatest share in British Columbia.</p>

      <p><a name="fig111"></a>The majority of old growth lost in the eastern and 
        lower elevations of North America was due to conversion of land to agriculture 
        and urban environments. In the west (see bar chart) and mountainous regions, 
        loss has been due to harvesting of timber and conversion to younger more 
        vigorously growing stands along with recent catastrophic events such as 
        the eruption of Mount St Helens and the Yellowstone fires (Harmon 1993, 
        H. John Heinz III Center 2001).</p>
      <p>The decline in old growth forest was largely driven by increasing worldwide 
        demand for timber and high prices in the 1970s (Mathews and Hammond 1999). 
        In recent years, losses due to timber harvesting have slowed because of 
        increasing environmental concerns including the desire to preserve natural 
        forests and to prevent further destruction of critical wildlife habitat 
        and biological diversity.</p>
      <p>Natural forests are still deemed by some to be essential to Canada's 
        industrial timber supply. Canada harvests about 175 million m<sup>3</sup> 
        of timber annually (NRC 2000) from approximately 1 million ha, or 0.5 
        per cent of the nation's commercial forest base. There is little mature 
        second growth forest and so logging continues mainly from mature natural 
        forests.</p>
      <p>The paradigm shift towards the ecosystem approach to managing North America's 
        old growth forests reflects the combined power of scientific knowledge, 
        the action of voluntary groups, public awareness, market pressures on 
        industry, and governmental response (see box). </p>

            <p>Clayoquot Sound, a 1 000 km<sup>2</sup> wilderness on Vancouver 
              Island, became the focus of a well publicized debate over old growth 
              logging. Beginning in 1984, environmentalists and the Nuu-chah-nulth 
              First Nation protested against clearcutting by blocking logging 
              roads, among other tactics. During 1989-93, government task forces 
              attempted to resolve the conflict and large tracts of coastal temperate 
              rainforest were set aside for protection (MSRM 2002). Claiming that 
              logging was still permitted on 70 per cent of the Sound, the protesters 
              continued their actions, and brought national and international 
              attention to the issue. </p>
            <p>In 1995, in recognition that the Nuu-chah-nulth had not been adequately 
              consulted, public negotiations began on a settlement with the First 
              Nation peoples. Recommendations were formulated and adopted by the 
              provincial government (May 1998). A 4 000 km<sup>2</sup> model forest 
              was also established. </p>
            <p>Progress was subsequently made in resolving the remaining conflicts. 
              One of Canada's largest forest products companies announced in 1998 
              that it would phase out clear-cutting in British Columbia and design 
              a new strategy focusing on old growth conservation (MacMillan 1998). 
              An agreement was struck between First Nations and environmentalists 
              to set aside most of the western coast of Clayoquot Sound and to 
              promote economic development through small-scale logging, non-timber 
              forest products and ecotourism. With the January 2000 designation 
              of Clayoquot Sound as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, industry, environmentalists, 
              governments and First Nations established a new form of governance 
              based on shared responsibility for the ecosystem (ENS 1999, Clayoquot 
              Biosphere Trust 2000).</p>
