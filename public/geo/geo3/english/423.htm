      <p>There is a strong correlation between economic growth and waste generation, 
        especially waste from urban-based consumption. In the EU, waste generation 
        per capita from household and commercial activities, which constitutes 
        only part of the total amount of municipal waste, already exceeds the 
        target of 300 kg per capita per year set in the EU's fifth environmental 
        action plan (EEA 2001) by 100 kg. Most European countries have recycling 
        schemes, particularly for paper and glass - although this development 
        has been only a partial success because the generation of waste paper 
        and glass has also increased.</p>
      <p>Sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants is estimated to have increased 
        in the EU from 5.2 to 7.2 million tonnes dry solids during 1992-98, and 
        further growth is expected (EEA 2001). Such volumes are increasingly difficult 
        to absorb through incineration, dumping in landfills and recycling in 
        agriculture. The problem is being compounded by the fact that sludge is 
        often contaminated with heavy metals and other toxic chemicals, which 
        even in minute concentrations can affect human health (Hall and Dalimier 
        1994).</p>
      <p>In most European countries, landfilling is still the most common treatment 
        route for waste, even though there is an increasing shortage of available 
        sites. This is because, in both Western and Eastern Europe, recycling 
        is rarely economically viable. However, 'producer responsibility' for 
        the environmentally sound disposal of packaging and products is achieving 
        widespread acceptance (UNEP 1996).</p>
      <p>Different approaches have been adopted in different countries. Germany 
        is shifting responsibility for managing packaging waste to industry as 
        a mandate, while in France agreements are mostly voluntary although stringent 
        reporting is required (UNEP 1996). In France, municipalities remain responsible 
        for waste collection but industry has been made responsible for the recycling 
        of only certain materials. In the United Kingdom, all companies involved 
        in the packaging chain are required to meet a share of the total responsibility: 
        47 per cent for retailers, 36 per cent for packers and fillers, 11 per 
        cent for converters, and 6 per cent for raw material manufacturers (PPIC 
        1998).</p>
      <p>Air quality, noise pollution and waste are not the only urban environmental 
        problems in Europe. Other problems include traffic congestion, utilization 
        of green space, management of water resources and, particularly in CEE, 
        an ageing urban infrastructure such as deteriorating apartment housing 
        and inadequately maintained water mains. To deal with these often interrelated 
        problems, focus is shifting from issue-based approaches to more integrated 
        models for sustainable urban development. Legislation is still one of 
        the major implementation instruments for improving the urban environment. 
        However, instruments such as economic incentives mechanisms, awareness 
        creation through information campaigns and strategic investments are also 
        being used to address environmental concerns (UNCHS 2001c).</p>
