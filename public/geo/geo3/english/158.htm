      <p>Despite being a minority activity in terms of income and employment, 
        agriculture is the dominant land use in Europe. Since the 1950s, Europe 
        has experienced a continuing trend towards urbanization at the expense 
        of natural, semi-natural and agricultural land. The area under productive 
        agriculture in Western Europe has fallen over the past 30 years - by 6.5 
        per cent for arable and permanent crops and by 10.9 per cent for permanent 
        pasture (FAOSTAT 2000). However, the decrease has been accompanied by 
        more intensive production methods. This intensification trend seems set 
        to continue, and better integrated spatial and land use planning and management 
        are required to tackle the problems associated with land cover and land 
        use change. During the 1990s, in many parts of Central and Eastern Europe, 
        pressure on land resources began to decrease, due to the collapse of centrally 
        planned economies, the ending of state subsidies to large collective farms 
        and depopulation of rural areas. The economic collapse also led to a sharp 
        decrease in the use of agricultural chemicals, abandonment of huge irrigation 
        projects and agricultural land, and a decrease in numbers of livestock 
        with a generally beneficial effect on the environment. A substantial land 
        area is being reforested, and this trend may accelerate with climate change.</p>
      <p>In recent years, increased attention has been given to the restoration 
        and protection of wetlands. About two-thirds of the European wetlands 
        that existed 100 years ago have been lost (EC 1999). Wetlands are the 
        only ecosystem type that is covered by its own international convention, 
        the Ramsar Convention of 1971, under which signatories agree to include 
        wetland conservation in their national planning and to promote sound utilization 
        of wetlands. In 1985, the World Wildlife Fund and the International Union 
        for the Conservation of Nature launched a campaign to promote public awareness 
        about wetlands and their importance. A major goal was to ensure that wetland 
        development goes ahead only when all the implications are understood and 
        when plans have been produced to ensure that the environmental consequences 
        are minimized.</p>
      <p>Policies and measures relating explicitly to land use planning and management 
        have generally been the responsibility of national and local level governments 
        in Western Europe, while in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) there has 
        been an abrupt change from central planning to local or no planning. Since 
        1989, the agricultural policies of CEE have gradually moved into line 
        with those of the European Union. A number of international policy initiatives 
        also exist relating to land management (see box below).</p>

            <p>International policy efforts to protect ecosystems and wildlife 
              habitats through global conventions include the Ramsar Convention 
              on wetlands, the biodiversity convention and the European Spatial 
              Development Perspective (ESDP) initiated by the Ministers responsible 
              for Regional/Spatial Planning in the European Union.</p>
            <p>The ESDP is intended to improve the spatial coherence of European 
              Community (EC) policies. It examines both the achievements and the 
              inadequacies of the main policy areas that affect the development 
              of EC territory, including competition policy, policies linked to 
              networks in transport and telecommunications, structural funds, 
              agricultural and environment policy, and research, technology and 
              development (EC Committee on Spatial Development 1999).</p>
            <p>The Environment for Europe process also focuses attention on the 
              European landscape. The European Biodiversity and Landscape Strategy 
              was launched during the fourth Environment Ministerial Conference 
              in Århus (1998).</p>
            <p>These major international programmes all emphasize the need to 
              improve statistical monitoring activities. The European Land Use/Land 
              Cover Statistical Survey project (LUCAS) is a promising example 
              which was approved by the European Parliament in April 2000.</p>
