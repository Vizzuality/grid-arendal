      <p><a name="fig143"></a>Rapid population increases and changes in lifestyle 
        have contributed to the degradation of wetland ecosystems due to increased 
        exploitation of surface and groundwater. In Jordan, groundwater extraction 
        for urban needs increased from around 2 million m<sup>3</sup> in 1979 to around 25 
        million m<sup>3</sup> in 1993 (Fariz and Hatough-Bouran 1998) while an additional 
        25 million m<sup>3</sup> per year was used for irrigated agriculture. As well as 
        water extraction, pollution and impacts from refugee camps in the area 
        have led to the deterioration and drying up of the Azraq wetlands natural 
        reserve (Fariz and Hatough-Bouran 1998). As a consequence tourism in Azraq 
        has declined. In the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, many of the 
        date palm oases and natural freshwater springs have been lost in the past 
        two decades (Bundy, Connor and Harrison 1989).</p>
      <p>By far the most serious wetland change in West Asia over the past three 
        decades has occurred in the lower Mesopotamian marshlands, where serial 
        satellite images confirm a loss of around 90 per cent of the area of lake 
        and marshlands (UNEP 2001). This loss may be attributable in part to the 
        large number of dams now present on upstream parts of the Tigris- Euphrates 
        system, but appears to be primarily a result of major hydrological engineering 
        works in southern Iraq, notably the completion of the Major Outfall Drain 
        (or 'Third River') which diverts water to the head of the Gulf. However, 
        despite some negative impacts of damming on indigenous biodiversity, the 
        loss of some habitats such as wetlands has been offset by the creation 
        of large artificial habitats elsewhere in the region. For example, the 
        630 km<sup>2</sup> Assad Lake in Syria on the Euphrates River is considered an important 
        site for migratory and wintering birds in West Asia.</p>

      <a name="fig144"></a>The rapid decline of the lower Mesopotamian marshlands 
      represents one of the most significant environmental events to have occurred 
      globally during the past 30 years. Loss of such an important habitat illustrates 
      the pressures on wetlands in the region, which are likely to intensify in 
      future as demand for water continues to increase. 
      <p>Food self-sufficiency policies in the region have resulted in the cultivation 
        of marginal lands for irrigated intensive agriculture. This has strained 
        water resources and caused salinization, with negative effects on freshwater 
        biodiversity. The breakdown of traditional systems of resource management 
        has also had a major impact on biodiversity. For example, the traditional 
        Al-Hema system, which facilitated the sustainable use of rangelands and 
        other natural resources by setting aside large reserves during times of 
        stress (Abu-Zinada and Child 1991, Daraz 1985) was abandoned in the 1960s 
        in the Arabian Peninsula and Mashriq countries. While about 3 000 hema 
        reserves existed in Saudi Arabia in 1969, only 71 were still in existence 
        under various degrees of protection in 1984 and only nine were on the 
        1997 Protected Areas list (WCPA 2000).</p>
      <p>Coastal and marine biodiversity is threatened by several human activities 
        including pollution (oil spills, industrial and domestic discharges into 
        the sea), physical alteration of habitats (sand dredging and landfills), 
        climate variability and alien species introduced by ballast water (ROPME 
        1999, UNEP/MAP 1999). The extent of mangroves has been decreasing along 
        the shores of the Gulf over the past 30 years due to unplanned coastal 
        development to the extent that only 125-130 km<sup>2</sup> of mangrove patches remain. 
        In Saudi Arabia, more than 40 per cent of the Gulf coastline has been 
        reclaimed and almost 50 per cent of the mangroves lost (Sheppard, Price 
        and Roberts 1992). In the Arabian Peninsula seas, about 20 000 km<sup>2</sup> of 
        coral reefs or 7.9 per cent of the total area of world corals have been 
        exposed to bleaching due to increases in sea water temperature caused 
        by El Niño (UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and WRI 2000). It is feared that global 
        warming will intensify this phenomenon. In the Mashriq sub-region many 
        marine species, including Mediterranean monk seals, marine turtles and 
        marine sponges, are threatened by the continuous deterioration of coastal 
        water quality due to sedimentation, nutrient discharge and eutrophication 
        (Lakkis 1996, Tohme 1996).</p>
