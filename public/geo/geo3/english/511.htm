      <p>One of the most effective responses to human vulnerability to environmental 
        change is to strengthen mechanisms for early warning. Many actions can 
        be taken to protect life and property if warning is received in time. 
        While some threats are inherently unpredictable, many of those arising 
        from threats from environmental degradation and mismanagement, and from 
        human activities, can now be anticipated with some precision. Early warning 
        capacities are increasing steadily with technological advances in environmental 
        observing, assessment and communications. Examples are the cyclone early 
        warning systems that have been established in India and Mauritius.</p>

          <td>Forecasting El Niño events can help countries with their strategic 
            planning to ensure security in areas such as agriculture, fishing, 
            water resource management, flood control and energy supply, thereby 
            reducing the vulnerability of the people and country. The Tropical 
            Atmospheric-Ocean (TAO) array of ocean observation buoys, using measurements 
            of surface sea temperature, helps provide the first indication of 
            an El Niño six to nine months ahead of the event. A number of institutions 
            in Peru, including the Instituto Geofisico, are working together to 
            improve predictions of El Niño events using statistical modelling. 
            Such forecasts of rainfall and hot and cold events have helped farmers 
            to plan better use of water resources for irrigation, and fishermen 
            to prepare better for variations in fish stocks. Forecasts of the 
            next rainy season are issued in Peru each November, after which farmers' 
            representatives and government officials meet to decide the appropriate 
            combination of crops to plant. A forecast of El Niño weather will 
            mean recommendations to plant crops that prefer wet conditions, such 
            as rice, and to avoid crops that prefer drier weather. Australia, 
            Brazil, Ethiopia and India are some of the countries that have taken 
            similar initiatives.</td>

      <p>Conventionally, early warning means an urgent indication of an impending 
        hazard (ISDR Secretariat 2001). There is a need for both sudden onset 
        warnings, for imminent disaster threats such as tropical storms and floods, 
        and slow onset warnings for disseminating information about disasters 
        that may develop over time such as famine and drought.</p>
      <p>The term early warning is often taken to mean prediction' when in fact 
        the occurrence of many threatening events is essentially unpredictable. 
        Early warning simply means that an event is imminent and the time to escape 
        from it or take action against it is now. Early warning information can 
        be produced in the context of a broader vulnerability assessment process, 
        which includes the production and communication of forecast information 
        and the incorporation of that information in user decisions.</p>
      <p>To be effective, an early warning system must be able to stimulate a 
        timely response before an event takes place. It must identify who are 
        the users of early warning information and what is the most efficient 
        way to reach them with credible information to enhance their powers of 
        decision-making. It must then translate relevant data into early warning 
        indicators that decision-makers can easily interpret and use.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the single most important factor that will lead governments 
        to incorporate the use of early warning systems and information in decision-making 
        is the political will to invest in response systems, both nationally and 
        internationally (Buchanan-Smith 2001). One example of an operational early 
        warning system which has generated such a response is the Famine Early 
        Warning System Network for Africa (see box).</p>

              improve food security in 17 drought-prone countries in Africa, through 
              African-led food security and response planning networks that reduce 
              the vulnerability of people at risk. FEWS NET, scheduled to run 
              until 2005, is the successor to FEWS, which began in 1985. The goal 
              is to strengthen the abilities of African countries and regional 
              organizations to manage threats to food security by providing early 
              warning and vulnerability information. Achievements include:</p>

              <li>participating closely in national systems and regional institutions
