<P>Untreated bubonic plague, a bacterial infection transmitted to humans by the 
bite of a flea when preferred blood meals are not available from rats or cats, 
becomes systemic with person-toperson airborne droplets spread by coughing. This 
is pneumonic plague which occurred in Surat, India in September 1994. The spread 
of pneumonic plague was probably due to workers with incubating plague leaving 
Maharashtra, arriving at Surat's crowded riverside shanty-town. Prodromal 
conditions in Maharashtra included a recent earthquake, corpses of animals 
ignored due to Indian aversion to touching dead beings, and Hindu customs 
preventing people from killing rats. Surat's pneumonic plague caused panic which 
drove thousands of people to cities all over India where cases of plague were 
reported. A brief history of the plague outbreak and techniques for prevention 
and containment are summarized. The paper discusses inappropriate government 
directives, the suppression of actual case numbers, panicbuying of Tetracycline 
(inexpensive antibiotic treatment) causing shortages, and delayed intervention 
at several levels. All these factors contributed to the spread of plague .</P>

<P>"Plague" is a part of all human history, and delivers a twinge of fear to 
persons who may be exposed to the disease. In this day of rapid air travel, 
exposure to an epidemic outbreak of plague which is occurring half-way around 
the world can impinge on our security. If an individual developed symptoms of 
plague after arriving in a distant city, we expect public health authorities 
would take immediate action to control the possibility of disease spread, and 
isolate, diagnose, and properly treat the individual. Ineffective procedures 
allowing spread of plague undermine the public's confidence in health policy 
which should protect citizens from illness. Residents of any country want to 
trust in the training of employees who work at docks where boats bring huge 
sealed containers from India. Rats rarely escape from measures designed to 
eliminate them. Airline hostesses would also receive training to recognize a 
possibly serious contagious disease on long airplane flights if a person showed 
suggestive symptoms. Ground crews would be prepared to isolate such an 
individual on arrival. written information would be given to passengers 
debarking the plane to take certain steps should they note specific symptoms. 
These methods citizens expect will always be done to protect them from a serious 
imported health problem which could spread rapidly in a vulnerable population. 
Unfortunately, for reasons related to political, financial, educational, 
communication, and public health structural problems, India was not prepared to 
deal with an outbreak of plague in 1994.</P>
<H2><A name=definition><U>Definition and Description of Plague:</U> </A></H2>
<P>Plague is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium <I>Yersinia pestis. 
</I>The causative organism is carried by rodents (the reservoir of infection) 
and spread by the bite of a flea <I>(Xenopsylla cheopsis). </I>When certain 
breeds of susceptible rats (sylvatic plague: Rattus rattus, bubonic plague: 
Rattus norwegicus and ground squirrels) become infected and die off, the fleas 
look to other, less preferable sources of blood meals: cats, dogs and humans. 
People entering the area where rats and humans live intimately become infected 
by bites of infected fleas causing the more common bubonic plague, or "Black 
Death." When not treated, bubonic disease becomes systemic and effects the lungs 
and other vital organs; coughing spreads plague bacillus through the air. This 
virulent infection then spreads by droplet from person-toperson, and when 
inhaled, infects the lungs causing pneumonic plague. Plague may become systemic 
initially, causing death the first day of the infection (septicemic plague). 
Plague meningitis is more rare, developing over a week after the original 
infection was inadequately treated: mortality is high (Butler in Strickland, 
1991, pp. 411-414). Humans are an "accidental host"-they play no role in the 
continuation of spread of plague in nature except in pneumonic spread, 
person-to-person (Butler, p. 409). Appendix A illustrates transmission patterns 
of the three types of plague.</P>
<P>Signs of bubonic plague will occur within 1-7 days of infection: fever, 
chills, headache, malaise, aching muscles, prostration, nausea, and abdominal 
discomfort. Bubonic plague will manifest in swollen and "exquisitely" tender 
Iymph nodes (buboes) especially in the groin, occasionally under the arms or in 
the neck (the patient will hold his head sideways to relieve the discomfort from 
the swelling). Other symptoms, which gave Black Death its name, include 
hemorrhage, but at the same time widespread clotting of the blood in blood 
vessels, causing 1centimeter areas of necrosis (dead tissue which turns black) 
and becomes gangrenous rapidly (Taylor, 1985, p. 1301). Untreated, this is fatal 
in 50% of cases (Benenson,1990, p.324). Pneumonic plague symptoms include cough, 
bloody sputum, sub sternal chest pain (from the enlarged Iymph nodes in the 
mediastinal area) and difficulty breathing. Septicemic plague may result in 
sudden and intense shock without signs of localized infection. A person may show 
combinations of symptoms of any of these three types (<U>MMWR,</U> 1994, 
689-690). Untreated pneumonic and septicemic plague are invariably fatal. Early 
treatment with streptomycin or tetracycline improves survival considerably. 
Recovery from plague does not confer immunity: reinfection occurs (Benenson, 
1990, p. 324, 326).</P>
<H2><A name=history><U>Brief History of Plague Epidemics</U> </A></H2>
<P>Plague is one of the oldest diseases recorded. l Samuel 5:9 says, . . . "the 
Lord's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted 
the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors in the 
groin."</P>
<P>How did plague spread from the Middle East in 1000 BC as widely as it now 
exists? "An understanding of the geographic diffusion process of a disease can 
result in new insights into its environmental associations, means of survival 
between epidemics, and transmission" (Meade,1988, p. 250). Historically, plague 
has been spread from one country to another by rats in the holds of ships, fleas 
in bundles of blankets on the backs of camels, or in backpacks, and through 
people traveling from place to place, infected with the bacillus but not yet 
showing any symptoms. Countries with basic public health needs may be more 
likely to have large outbreaks of infectious diseases. Rats and fleas are 
frequently associated with poor sanitation, especially when living intimately 
with humans in crowded slum conditions. Epidemics of plague occurred in 542 AD 
in Egypt, Turkey and Europe, in the fourteenth century in Asia Minor, Africa and 
Europe (killing about 25% of the population), in Europe during the fifteenth to 
eighteenth centuries, and the present pandemic which began in 1860 in China 
(spreading by ship to Hong Kong, India, Brazil and California). Thousands have 
died of plague, and large-scale panic has always ensued in those areas of 
incidence. "For death had filled the city with panic . . . those who did not die 
were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven" (I 
Samuel 5:11-12).</P>
<P>Thomas Butler (1991) summarizes a brief world history of plague in 
Strickland's <U>Hunter's Tropical Medicine</U>. In the first half of the 
twentieth century, India had more deaths from plague than any other country. In 
1966 India officially declared that plague had been conquered there. In the 
1960's, Vietnam, reporting 10,000 deaths/year from plague through the 1970's, 
became the country of highest incidence. By comparison, this year's outbreak in 
India (reportedly over 4500 suspected, and 1000 diagnosed cases, but fewer than 
100 officially reported deaths) is not remarkable. Much larger numbers of Indian 
citizens die of either measles or diarrheal illness in any given year. 
Antibiotics, readily and cheaply available over-the-counter without a 
prescription, have radically reduced plague deaths in India. However, even with 
such a historical and ongoing problem with plague, conditions which encourage 
the persistence of plague continue in India.</P>
<H2><A name=facts><U>The Facts of the Outbreak</U></A></H2>
<P>In mid-August the warning sign of ratfall (domestic rats falling from rafters 
onto the floors of dwellings and dying there) was noted in Mamla village (John, 
1994, p. 972). Reuter's and AP news agencies reported that "doctors in Mamla 
village in the southern state of Maharashtra found thirtyfive people with tumors 
in their armpits and groins, symptoms of bubonic plague." John (1994, p. 972) 
notes that by mid-September 10% of the population of that village had bubonic 
plague (see map of India, Appendix B).</P>
<P>Intemet's "soc.culture.indian" news group (transcribed from Reuter's and AP 
news services) described on September 19-20, 1994, that several people in Surat 
exhibited symptoms of fever, headache and breathlessness, and coughing up blood. 
Doctors initially treated it as an influenza epidemic. Panic began when the 
patients died within hours of reporting sick: symptoms of pneumonic plague. 
Finally, on September 25, the first sputum cultures grew <I>Yersinia pestis 
</I>(the bacteria causing plague) six days after the original wave of deaths was 
reported (John, 1994, p. 972).</P>
<P>For various reasons, widely varying numbers of deaths due to plague were 
reported. The poor cannot afford medical care, so usually nurse their own and 
die in their homes. A funeral pyre is then built over the body which is thus 
cremated in the best of circumstances. In other cases, the body is thrown into 
the river. Deaths among the poor are seldom reported, merely estimated.</P>
<P>A financial reason for minimizing the incidence and severity of plague was 
the location of factories (Surat is India's diamond-cutting and silk-production 
center) in the area of the slums. The "cordon sanitaire" sealing the epidemic 
off from the rest of the city would have prevented workers getting to the 
factory, cutting off their income, as well as slowing production.</P>
<P>One major political reason for making efforts to deny the outbreak was the 
holiday season to begin only one month hence, with much visiting of family 
members from other countries, as well as large conferences with international 
guests invited to present papers and draw thousands of international tourists. 
Tourism is one of India's major financial businesses. India had much to lose by 
allowing news of a plague epidemic to reach the international press.</P>
<P>From the first cases noted in outlying villages in Maharashtra state in 
mid-August (bubonic plague, with enlarged and draining Iymph nodes in groin and 
axilla) to the last reported pneumonic plague cases in Surat during the first 
week of October, seven weeks elapsed. The total official number of deaths 
reported was 234 nationwide: 52 (or 61 or 300) from Surat, 3 from Delhi. 
Unofficial estimates indicate several hundred deaths. Cases occurred in seven of 
India's states: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar 
and Madhya Pradesh (See map, Appendix B).</P>
<H2><A name=conditions><U>Conditions for India's 1994 Plague 
Outbreak</U></A></H2>
<P>How and why did "Black Plague" happen to flare up in India in 1994? Of 
course, many factors led to this and these are considered below. Plague is a 
nidal disease, one which exists in a "nest," a reservoir of animals which 
perpetuate the bacillus (see Appendix D). For this disease to emerge from the 
"silent zone" into infecting a human population, four elements must converge in 
time and place: an agent (the bacterium <I>Yersinia pestis), </I>a vector (the 
flea <I>Xenopsylla cheopsis), </I>a reservoir (rat or ground squirrel) (May in 
Meade,1988, p. 77) and a human host.</P>
<P>Reuter's and AP News Service provide daily information from India, and most 
of the on-site detailed reports from India in this paper are due to their 
gathering of information and conducting interviews between August and October, 
1994. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of poor villagers have migrated to 
Surat in search of work in the city's silk, and diamond-cutting and polishing 
industries. Many of the city's 1.5 million inhabitants live outside the Surat 
city limits in squalid shanty towns. The conditions of these slums in 
August,1994, were typical of shanty towns all over India: open sewers, tightly 
clustered shelters made of cement or plastic sheets, rotting animal carcasses, 
heaps of garbage, and pools of stagnant water fill the alleys. Floods in early 
August heightened the horror as the human waste and refuse mixed with slush and 
mud were washed up and left on the riverbank creating ideal conditions for the 
spread of infection. Cows, dogs and pigs stand on top of high piles of garbage 
while people sell vegetables from rickety wooden carts alongside: rats thrive in 
such a setting.</P>
<P>It is highly probable that workers from Maharashtra state traveled to Surat 
to work after they had become infected. Living in crowded conditions without 
medical care or money to pay for it, untreated bubonic plague infections 
progressed systemically to plague pneumonia, and so inevitably commenced the 
rapid person-to-person spread of pneumonic plague.</P>
<P>A health official blames the outbreak on rats attracted by relief food sent 
to feed survivors of a September 1993 earthquake in Maharashtra that killed 
10,000-12,000 people. Not all of the bodies were recovered, providing an 
increase of food for rats, making probable an increase in the rat population. 
Officials maintain that the increasing numbers of rats in the area related to 
the villagers moving to new homes constructed by the government and converting 
their old, damaged homes into granaries to store food aid sent last year.</P>
<P>Plague bacillus spread widely due to a lack of preparedness by the public 
health authorities. Assessment of the situation, first in Maharashtra, then in 
Surat, was not done, nor were appropriate measures to contain the disease 
undertaken.</P>
<P>Another factor allowing wide spread of plague bacillus was that broad 
spectrum antibiotics, required to curb the disease, had been exhausted due to 
panic- buying of the over-the-counter antibiotics in response to media 
suggestions. Physicians and pharmacists escaping the city brought large amounts 
of treatment drugs away with them for their families and friends. Preventive 
dosing with the essential antibiotic made locating medication for treatment of 
suspected cases difficult. Supplies were being rushed to Surat from other parts 
of the country on an emergency basis. Officials raided pharmacies where 
antibiotics were being hoarded for black-market prices due to scarcity, and 
turned the antibiotics over to health officials. Insufficient supply persisted 
because those with adequate resources to buy purchased and hoarded medication, 
worsening the chances of the poor to have medication available if they became 
ill.</P>
<P>A counterproductive cultural factor, but one which is a very influential 
factor in plague, is an old Hindu practice, rat worship, which takes place in 
many sites in India. In some shrines, tens of thousands of rats race across the 
floor, feasting on fruit and candy. Many rats leap onto a platform where food 
has been placed under a golden umbrella by worshipers, while priests chant hymns 
and play cymbals. In Hindu mythology, the elephant-headed god Ganesh is 
accompanied by a rat (or a mouse, it is sometimes said) whenever he travels. No 
Hindu worship is complete without an offering to Ganesh and his small 
companion.</P>
<P>Hindu residents continue to visit city parks to feed the tens of thousands of 
rats who live there. Though rats infest much of India, (including farms where 
they eat nearly one-quarter of the produce) Indians who are Hindu do not kill 
any animals, including rats, nor will they touch any dead animal. "I do trap a 
rat when I see one in my kitchen, but I can never kill it. It is a sin to kill 
the companion of our God," said one Hindu housewife. At daybreak in many towns, 
villages and cities, Indian men and women are seen carrying rats in traps and 
releasing them at a distance from their homes. Rarely is one killed.</P>
<H2><A name=WHO><U>WHO Plague Action Plan, Compared with Actions Actually Taken 
in India to Curb the Epidemic of Plaque</U> </A></H2>
<P>The World Health Organization's (WHO) <U>Plague Manual</U> (Bahmanyar,1976) 
describes in orderly detail procedures to undertake when cases of plague occur 
in a given area. For some reason, this information was not promptly utilized in 
India. Financial, political, and social interests encouraged divergent action 
from WHO's precise direction. Local leaders in plague-ridden areas of India did 
not take early action to combat the threat. Since plague is largely a disease of 
the slumliving poor, the usual stance is to ignore outbreaks of illness caused 
by living in squalor, since India's middle and upper classes live in walled-off 
compounds. Mavalankar believes the government seemed to lack correct, concise 
and practical information (1994, p.1298). A parallel opinion is expressed by Dr. 
Dominik Wujastyk from Wellcome Institute, in London, on the "Soc.culture.indian" 
newsgroup on Internet. He says the <I>Indian Express </I>Newspaper "criticized 
the city for failing to meet with medical experts, parents, teachers or federal 
officials before making the decisions. . . Evidently, people in authority are 
unsure of what level of response is appropriate." (Oct. 4,1994). Due to the 
weaknesses in diagnostic capabilities and communication within the health and 
political system, the extent of the problem was probably not recognized. Many 
actions taken were not appropriate to curb the disease, indeed some actions may 
have encouraged the spread of plague for a longer period of time. This section 
will compare the suggested and actual procedures, and discuss outcomes which 
resulted from unadvised procedure. Appendix D shows diagrammatically 
intervention points to prevent susceptible individuals from becoming plague 
cases.</P>
<P>Basic foundations of public health infrastructure must include adequate 
financial resources to provide basic diagnostic laboratory services. Many 
hospitals and states in India do not have microscopy labs (John,1994, p. 972). 
Krishnan reminds us that hospitals do not have an uninterrupted supply of power 
and water (1994, p.1298) limiting their activities. In many cases, no definite 
lab diagnosis was made, so definite numbers of cases are not known. Economics of 
cheap treatment with Tetracycline compared with more expensive lab tests 
indicated the most good could be done by presumptive treatment (that is, 
presuming that the person with symptoms of plague had it and giving antibiotics 
without lab testing). Since the poor would not have money to pay for medication 
or a physician, the few reported cases would indicate a much larger number which 
were not reported.</P>
<P>India has experienced epidemics of plague several times during this century, 
the most recent only thirty years ago. The simultaneous incidence of large 
numbers of cases of bubonic plague in near-by Maharashtra state whence large 
numbers of factory workers commute should logically have alerted Surat's 
experienced health officials to watch for the next predictable signs: symptoms 
of either pneumonic or meningococcal plague due to untreated bubonic disease. 
Several reported cases of "flu" resulting in death in twelve hours should have 
prompted first, immediate implementation of quarantine, then testing sputum for 
plague bacteria. Due to the political pressure to encourage tourist trade as 
well as exports, such information as existed on plague incidence was overlooked 
in early stages, and suppressed after the first week of reporting. For the sake 
of the economy, the fewer cases diagnosed the better.</P>
<H3><A name=step1><U>Step 1: Quarantine, or <I>Cordon Sanitarie</I></U> 
</A></H3>
<P>The first step when plague occurs is to set up a <I>cordon sanitaire 
</I>around infected neighborhoods and/or the field hospital where sick patients 
are taken for treatment within the restricted area. Isolation wards in hospitals 
must also be quarantined. This quarantine boundary must be guarded by police or 
the military, until seven days after the last case is diagnosed.</P>
<P>In India, no quarantine was implemented until a week after the first cases of 
highly contagious pneumonic plague were diagnosed. Unsanitary hospital 
conditions encouraged the spread of plague by provoking the flight of plague 
patients from hospitals. Even Dr. S. J. Rehman, deputy director of the National 
Institute of Communicable Diseases left the hospital in New Delhi due to 
unsanitary conditions before he was treated for a high fever and cough. Families 
of patients who left the hospital stated that the patient received no care and 
that conditions were very poor in the hospital. Hospital staff went on strike 
briefly on September 25 due to a clash with the city over the hospital's 
cleanliness. Many physicians had left the city, and six staff members of the 
hospital were suspended for not coming to work since the plague epidemic 
began.</P>
<P>Families who saw that a family member was dying removed the patient from the 
hospital and brought them home to die, then privately performed the traditional 
cremation ceremony beside the river. This practice had two effects: increasing 
spread, as well as making a near accurate count of mortality impossible. On 
September 25 it was reported that during the first five days of the outbreak 
(September 19-25) at least 120 suspected plague patients had left Surat 
Hospital's isolation ward against medical advice and strict instructions had 
been given to track them down. Unfortunately, it was nearly impossible to locate 
such patients as they had no address. Crowding in the shantytowns doubtless 
caused these escaped patients to increase numbers of cases. The neighborhood 
where cases occurred was never cordoned off by military police to prevent 
movement of uninfected people into an infected area.</P>
<P>Man-to-man spread is controlled by prompt and on-the-spot isolation and 
treatment of patients. All family and contacts of patients must be quarantined 
and treated with preventive antibiotics for seven days. If a field hospital is 
established, two issues must be addressed. First, the patient may be so ill that 
he may go into shock if placed in a vertical position. Secondly, transporting 
the patient with pneumonic plague may cause new cases along the route of 
transport. Pneumonic plague spreads rapidly due to its associated paroxysmal 
coughing with large amounts of sputum simultaneously ejected into the air. 
Preferably the family will be quarantined inside their home . Family members and 
contacts of the patient must protect themselves from breathing unfiltered air, 
and health workers should wear goggles to prevent saliva from entering their 
eyes. Several layers of thin muslin can serve for a mask for mouth and nose in 
the lack of official masks. Public health personnel must care for the patients, 
and relatives and visitors should not be allowed within the area of strict 
isolation until all the patient's symptoms have disappeared.</P>
<P>During the three to four weeks of quarantine, economic problems of the local 
population will be serious. Consideration for the needs of local people must be 
managed carefully: allowing usual deliveries to be provided from outside, 
allowing well people, on preventive antibiotic treatment, access to their 
fields, water sources and livestock, allowing people inside the quarantined area 
to send out and sell their perishable products. Lacking this care for the needs 
of the quarantined people, they will tend to break the regulations, spreading 
the disease to other areas.</P>
<P>Because quarantine was delayed, thousands of terror-stricken citizens fled 
Surat. From September 19-22, 1994, there were three straight days of chaos at 
the Surat railway station and the bus stand. People clambered on any and every 
vehicle that could take them away. Estimates of 400,000-600,000 people fled to 
other parts of India (one-fifth of the 2 million population of Surat), some in 
the incubation phase of the plague infection. More than half of the physicians 
departed as well. Isolation wards were not set up in major hospitals until days 
after confirmation of the epidemic (Anonymous, <U>Lancet,</U> 1994, p. 
1034).</P>
<P>Officials asked people not to leave, then asked them to return to Surat to 
avoid spreading the infection. After a three-day exodus, departures slowed, but 
official sealing of the city was not attempted until September 23, five days 
after the first pneumonic plague patients had died. Travelers arriving in 
distant areas from Surat were not registered or monitored until three days after 
the epidemic was confirmed (Anonymous, <U>Lancet,</U> 1994, p.1034). In Bombay 
from September 24-26, soldiers went door-to-door checking homes for plague cases 
(reached 2.8 million of the 12 million population during these three days. On 
September 25, seven days after the first diagnosed case of pneumonic plague, two 
companies of Rapid Action Force paramilitary officers began to guard the Surat's 
Civil Hospital where infectious cases were housed, to prevent any more from 
leaving.</P>
<P>Uncertainty of government officials on how to proceed with quarantine was 
illustrated by Delhi's schools reopening only five days after they were closed 
(Anonymous, <U>Lancet,</U> p. 1034). On September 23, Surat authorities ordered 
closure of all schools, colleges, cinema halls and public gardens for an 
"uncertain period." Plague had been rapidly spreading through Surat's slums for 
nearly two weeks by this time. People walked in the streets with their faces 
covered by handkerchiefs (probably not effective--as large weave is permeable to 
the bacillus). Several layers of fine muslin would have been more effective. 
Industrial units, banks, offices and diamond cutting units were asked to shut 
down until further notice. A calendar (Appendix C) shows the extent and duration 
of the outbreak, and the conflicting reports of cases and deaths in the affected 
districts of India.</P>
<H3><A name=step2><U>Step 2: Provide Antibiotics</U></A></H3>
<P>The second consideration is obtaining large amounts of the proper antibiotics 
to treat the ill and administer preventive antibiotics to the health care 
providers and close relatives. This step was taken, and large amounts of 
antibiotics were sent to affected areas. The over-the-counter nature of these 
antibiotics made abuse of the system possible by those who could afford to buy 
medication for their families in case it was needed, or to take as prevention, 
even though it was not needed. Pharmacists and physicians bought large amounts 
of these antibiotics, then left Surat with their families and the medications. 
On September 27, New Delhi officials raided pharmacies and confiscated 
antibiotics for sale at high black-market prices, and gave them to the health 
department for distribution.</P>
<P>To prevent this, the health department could establish procedures for early 
implementation in the event of another similar outbreak in which government 
medical officials controlled the dispensing of antibiotics in coordination with 
medical officials in charge of both isolation units and the area of quarantine. 
By September 25, seven days into the epidemic, city workers were distributing 
antibiotics in slum areas while they were clearing heaps of garbage from 
streets.</P>
<H3><A name=step3><U>Step 3: Elimination of Fleas</U></A></H3>
<P>The third factor of importance in the case of bubonic plague is elimination 
of as many fleas as possible. This is not what Surat needed to deal with,-not a 
single case of bubonic plague was reported in Surat. However, officials had 
started spraying disinfectant on stagnant water to prevent spread of plague. 
This is effective for malaria control but not to prevent the spread of plague. 
However, fleas theoretically may be infected by the patient during the last 
hours of his life, thereby becoming a source of further bubonic infection 
(Bahmanyar, 1976, pp. 59-60). In New Delhi, cars coming from Gujarat state 
(where Surat is) were sprayed on the inside with insecticide before crossing 
into the new state. In Bombay (Maharashtra state), trucks entering the city from 
Gujarat state (where only pneumonic plague existed) were being fumigated. 
Bubonic plague originated in Maharashtra state, so fumigation was cautious, but 
would not protect from the pneumonic disease spread by people leaving Surat in 
Gujarat state.</P>
<P>Deinsecting the area is desirable for a second reason: flies may spread 
organisms from sputum coughed up by the patient to the eyes or mouth of persons 
taking care of him. City workers were ordered to remove carcasses of cows, dogs, 
pigs and buffaloes Iying in streets which would tend to decrease numbers of 
flies, only indirectly a factor in plague. Reports stated this was done in the 
wealthier neighborhoods, where plague was not presently a problem. The weakness 
of Surat public health officials' communication and effectiveness showed clearly 
in their failure to effectively act in the areas of most need: that is, in the 
periurban slums where the most vulnerable live (Anonymous, <U>Lancet,</U> 
p.1034). Relief workers in Maharashtra (bubonic plague) correctly sprayed 
insecticides, distributed antibiotics as well as caught rats in the infected 
villages.</P>
<H3><A name=step4><U>Step 4: Elimination of Rats</U> </A></H3>
<P>A fourth issue is elimination of rats, essential in case of a bubonic plague 
outbreak. Surat did not have to deal with this, either. On September 23 
Maharashtra state authorities (five weeks after first bubonic plague cases were 
diagnosed in that area) summoned about 100 tribal Irulas from the southern state 
of Tamil Nadu to the plague affected areas in Maharashtra to catch rodents by 
hand. In New Delhi, large numbers of extra city workers were hired to spray 
inside houses in poor neighborhoods, and trap rats. Large numbers of garbage 
collectors were hired there, as well. Citizens asked why officials had allowed 
the conditions to worsen to such a degree as to allow plague to break out. 
Ecologists had raised an alarm over the spreading of poison on the farm lands to 
kill the rats. Extra bounties were paid to rat killers to prowl and hunt in the 
back streets at night. The spraying of insecticide would continue. This killing 
of first the fleas, then the rats was appropriate. (Killing rats first leaves 
many hungry fleas looking for a meal, and in the absence of their preferred 
rats, they will bite humans.)Fortunately, many rodents die in underground 
burrows, carrying their fleas, so are out of the way, and not likely to infect 
humans (Dawood, 1993, p.166). However, the next generation of rats may be 
infected by underground fleas, and start a new epizootic.</P>
<P>The elimination of rats to control plague was correct in the area reporting 
bubonic disease. Keep in mind, however, the panic in Surat was from 
<U>Pneumonic</U> plague, spread by airborne droplets from person to person. 
Bubonic plague was not reported there, so rats and fleas were of secondary 
importance.</P>
<H3><A name=step5><U>Step 5: Political and Financial Issues</U></A></H3>
<P>A fifth issue was both a financial and political issue: preventing 
dissemination of plague through cargo at seaports and by air transport. 
Transoceanic liners are not usually the issue, as they are rat-proofed when 
constructed. Small cargo and passenger boats are generally affected, sometimes 
to the point of being infested. Containers of cargo may contain rats and fleas. 
Bait boxes in the containers, and strips of insecticide-treated material will 
kill both rats and fleas within twenty-four hours. Fumigation of ships should be 
done where ports are infested with rats and fleas. Containers must not be opened 
in transit after they are closed and sealed (Bahmanyar, 1976, p. 60-61). Caution 
in watching for rats on the part of travelers and businesses receiving shipments 
of goods from India in large containers or from ships, was advised.</P>
<P>Airports in areas of endemic plague must effectively control both rats and 
fleas, by using poison to keep rats from living close to the airport, and 
putting insecticide in and around rat burrows. Last year Air India, India's 
international carrier, had to postpone four flights after rats were found in the 
cockpits of planes. The airline was concerned the rats might have damaged 
control panel wiring. Employees were reluctant to kill the rats. Preventive rat 
control in the area of the airports has obviously not been done. Rats on planes 
should be trapped, rather than poisoned to prevent a dead rat in an inaccessible 
area where function of the aircraft may be impaired. Aggressive rat control in 
the environs of the airport should prevent this problem. Action taken in India 
when airplanes were fumigated after passengers disembarked to prevent spread of 
pneumonic plague were probably not useful.</P>
<H3><A name=step6><U>Step 6: Control of Plaque in International Travelers</U> 
</A></H3>
<P>Physicians and nurses checked travelers for plague symptoms before they 
boarded planes, and emergency clinics were set up in all public transportation 
stations. People who manifested symptoms of plague could immediately be started 
on antibiotics and isolated with precautions against airborne spread.</P>
<P>However, the incubation period of one to seven days for pneumonic plague was 
not considered: names and addresses of travelers boarding planes in India were 
not taken, nor was written information provided about symptoms to be aware of, 
with directions to report immediately for medical care if such symptoms occurred 
within the next week. The rapidity of spread and diagnosed cases in areas all 
over the country in one to two days caused international airlines to place 
restrictions on receiving passengers from India. Some flights were not allowed 
to land and had to turn back and return to India.</P>
<P>Tourist trade was severely and negatively effected by the outbreak, so actual 
numbers of cases were distorted and deflated as much as possible; widely varying 
statistics were released on any given day. Authorities made it seem like 
"business as usual," and wanted conferences and family holiday visits to 
continue as planned. The social segregation of the poor in slums (where plague 
largely occurred) may have been somewhat protective to those of higher 
socioeconomic status and the tourists and business travelers. The embarrassment 
to India was that the eyes of the world focused on the squalor which allowed the 
plague outbreak. " . . [T]he poor are for once being seen as what they are, a 
direct threat to the rich. In India it has been said that the poor have finally 
taken their revenge in the only way they know-by dying" (Anonymous, 1994, 
<U>Lancet,</U> p. 1034-5).</P>
<P>After two weeks, the number of cases had diminished greatly. Theaters and 
schools again opened, and hotels cut their rates in half to attract 
tourists.</P>
<H2><A name=prevention><U>Prevention from exposure for Local 
Residents</U></A></H2>
<P>Persons going to visit, work, or live in India or other plague-endemic 
countries may take a few specific actions to protect themselves from exposure to 
plague. If rats are sharing the roof under which you live, apply insecticide to 
floors and around the outside of the dwelling. If rat burrows are obvious, 
insecticide generously applied within five feet of them (fleas jump four feet) 
and also inside the burrows is effective. Then trap the rats. DEET-containing 
insect repellents on exposed skin and insecticide containing permethrin on 
clothing will protect people from flea bites (Benenson,1990, p. 327). If these 
two steps (killing first fleas, then rats) are reversed, plague will spread more 
rapidly.</P>
<P>A "rat fall" (dead rats or rodents lying about) is alarming in areas where 
plague is endemic. Public health authorities want such information quickly in 
order to take protective action. A rat fall occurs when a population of rats has 
not been previously exposed to plague. The introduction of the bacteria 
frequently causes large numbers of vulnerable animals to die quite rapidly. The 
fleas which spread the disease from animal to animal will be seeking food, and 
although a second-best choice, humans are utilized for a blood meal, and plague 
crosses over from an animal-to-animal problem, to a disease which can kill 
people (Appendix A). Persons with pet cats or rabbits who live in plagueendemic 
areas need to be familiar with symptoms of plague in animals. Several cases of 
cats with plague pneumonia infecting their owner have occurred in the USA 
(<U>MMWR,</U> 1992, 41, p.738; Doll, 1994, p. 109). House cats, ground 
squirrels, and rabbits can transmit plague to people (Benenson, 1990, p. 
325).</P>
<P>Some individuals are at high risk for exposure to plague, and would be wise 
to take preventive antibiotics. Such people may deliver medical care to plague 
victims or trap rodents in plague-endemic areas. People who handle dead or sick 
animals, including pets, risk exposure to plague, and may choose to take 
tetracycline, or sulfonamides for children, until seven days after the last 
exposure to plague (Bahmanyar, 1976, p. 59).</P>
<P>Researchers working with <I>Yersinia pestis </I>bacillus may also choose to 
take plague vacci although it is not for sale in the United States due to its 
lack of effectiveness. It may make bubonic symptoms milder, but does not protect 
from the infection progressing to pneumonic plague (PDR, 1992, p. 15841585).</P>
<H2><A name=policy><U>Policy Options and Conclusions</U></A></H2>
<P>Plague, which has existed in India for hundreds of years, is usually confined 
to rodents. Unfortunately, conditions in India persist which allow for 
continuing outbreaks in human populations. The 1994 outbreak provided lessons 
and examples which India and the other nations at risk for plague would be wise 
to note.</P>
<P>T. Jacob John (<U>Lancet,</U> 1994, p. 972) states the key problem in India's 
response to the plague epidemic was a "lack of epidemiological alertness, skill 
and interventions." Eswar Krishnan (<U>Lancet, </U>1994, p. 1298) focuses on 
"the failure of administration to support scientific staff." A conspicuous 
absence of public health funding for epidemiological facilities to diagnose and 
track local health problems leaves India open to repeat a similar plague 
experience to that of 1994. Absence of basic laboratory facilities would 
eliminate any possible early response to plague cases and isolation of an area 
before the disease has spread. Financing health education for professional and 
local health care providers would allow individuals in all areas of India to 
receive basic sanitation information. Practical activities to prevent spread of 
infection could be taught, which may decrease hysteria. Health providers who 
have education as a priority in their job can teach vigilance to the poor when 
specific situations (such as rat-fall) are indicated as important to report. 
Sanitarians and sanitary workers could be educated and paid to do surveillance 
and clean-up in slums and city streets.</P>
<H2>Personal Protective Measures for Travel in Plague-Endemic Areas</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Keep food in closed containers 
  <LI>Burn or bury garbage 
  <LI>Insect repellent on skin 
  <LI>Permethrin insecticide on clothing, bedding 
  <LI>Spray/dust insecticide on floors inside and outside home 
  <LI>Dust pets with insecticide 
  <LI>Trap or poison rats 
  <LI>Don't camp near rodent burrows 
  <LI>Report rat-fall to health authorities 
  <LI>Don't handle sick or dead rodents </LI></UL>
<P>Funding for such traditional epidemiological techniques as "definition of 
size and location of the problem, surveillance and case reporting, rat-fall 
counts, isolation and treatment of cases--to clean up the rat-infested 
environment at the foci of infection" (Anonymous, <U>Lancet</U>,1994, p. 1034) 
must be established by law as a political and financial priority in the case of 
another plague epidemic. The huge slums in India's major cities where conditions 
allowing such a disease of squalor to exist are an embarrassment to a nation 
encouraging both financial and educational interaction with nations of varying 
levels of development.</P>
<P>Ashok Rattan, microbiologist, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences 
in New Delhi, advises culturing and testing of <I>Y. pestis </I>for drug 
sensitivities of new antibiotics for efficacy (Nadan,1994, p. 897) to provide 
possible better alternatives to Tetracycline, Streptomycin (which must be given 
intravenously) and Chloromycetin (which has unpleasant side effects). Improved 
epidemiological procedure in the early stages of an outbreak of plague would 
allow identification of the specific organism causing the illness, therefore, 
better care for those infected, and a more rapid control of the disease.</P>
<P>Another area to develop is that of authoritative, accurate and prompt 
directions delivered to health care providers for dealing with disease 
outbreaks. Continuing medical education of physicians in India to inform them of 
early and aggressive techniques to manage the occurrence of disease outbreaks at 
the first hint of a potential problem would both prevent such rapid spread of 
disease, and give them known techniques of epidemiological steps with which to 
proceed. Government support for such programs is essential to the health of the 
citizens of India. The exodus of physicians with the rest of the escaping 
population undermines citizens' trust in public health structure and 
effectiveness. Communication networks need to be established to provide 
physicians with accurate information, diagnostic laboratories, medication, and 
practical instruction for directing local public health activities. Public 
health education must extend to local neighborhoods and villages. Midwives are 
trained as health educators in many countries. Plague management education and 
certification with compulsory review and recertification every year or two would 
provide status and give authority to midwives in teaching cleanliness and 
health. More important, this certification would establish a system of 
communication and outreach from villages back to central authorities of 
surveillance information, and from authorities to the villages in case of need 
for information distribution, epidemic control or immunization.</P>
<P>Public health authorities worldwide have little, if any, personal experience 
with control of a pneumonic plague epidemic in today's world of rapid 
transportation. World Health Organization has written directions which should be 
at hand in airports, shipyards, and train stations around the world for instant 
reference (Anonymous, 1969, 1983). Directions must be clear, brief, and provide 
health authorities instant and proper actions to maintain the respect and trust 
of their citizens for protection of public welfare. Annual review and 
certification should be required for employees and managers of transportation 
centers. In time of need, employees need current information about location of 
the plague management manual, and prevention and containment procedures to 
follow in a calm and orderly fashion.</P>
<P>One cultural aspect of plague control which is difficult to change is the 
custom of the "bribe." When exit from a contaminated area is desired, when the 
person who wishes to leave has money to pay the local militia or train 
conductor, with a smile and a nod the money is pocketed and the person is 
allowed quietly to pass by. This ability to buy passage through any impediment 
to a desired objective would make difficult a cordon <I>sanitaire, </I>or the 
holding of hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonic plague in an isolation 
unit.</P>
<P>The tradition of rat worship, and the religious opposition to the taking of 
any animal's life, make plague in India a nightmare. If health authorities 
collected rats trapped overnight by householders, perhaps at least the custom of 
releasing trapped rats the next day could be adapted to public health needs. To 
attempt to change a culture where feeding rats in the park is an afternoon 
diversion, and the worship customs include feeding them in temples seems 
overwhelming. Perhaps to cage them and control the numbers while still allowing 
the customs to persist, but within state control, would be acceptable. Certainly 
the increase in amounts of farm produce available to feed people would be very 
welcome if numbers of rats were diminished.</P>
<P>Considerable misunderstanding on the part of officials exists in emergency 
situations due to a lack of funding for epidemiological stations and 
microbiological laboratories, and the lack of a communication system to quickly 
notify officials of health problems and provide direction to the public. Since 
financial support is lacking for public health (funding for professional and 
public education, and communication systems to transmit information regarding 
location, cause, diagnosis, and control of contagious diseases), future 
outbreaks are likely. <A name=appendices></P>
