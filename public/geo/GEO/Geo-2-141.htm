<P>The first phase of intensive data collection for the National Water-Quality 
Assessment (NAWQA) was completed during 1993-1995 in 20 major hydrologic basins 
of the United States. Ground-water land-use studies, designed to sample recently 
recharged ground water (generally within 10 years) beneath specific land-use and 
hydrogeologic settings, are a major component of the ground-water quality 
assessment for NAWQA. Pesticide results from the 41 land-use studies conducted 
during 1993-95 indicate that pesticides were commonly detected in shallow ground 
water, having been found at 54.4% of the 1,034 sites sampled in agricultural and 
urban settings across the United States. Pesticide concentrations were generally 
low, with over 95% of the detections at<STRONG> </STRONG>concentrations<STRONG> 
</STRONG>less than 1 µg/L<STRONG>. </STRONG>Of the 46 pesticide compounds 
examined, 39 were detected. The compounds detected most frequently were atrazine 
(38.2%), deethylatrazine (34.2%), simazine (18.0%), metolachlor (14.6%), and 
prometon (13.9%). Statistically significant relations were observed between 
frequencies of detection and the use, mobility, and persistence of these 
compounds.
<P>Pesticide were commonly detected in both agricultural (56.4%; 813 sites) and 
urban (46.6%; 221 sites) settings. Frequent detections of pesticides in urban 
areas indicate that, as is the case with agricultural pesticide use in 
agricultural areas, urban and suburban pesticide use significantly contribute to 
pesticide occurrence in shallow ground water. Although pesticides were detected 
in ground water sampled in urban areas and all nine of the agricultural land-use 
categories examined, significant variations in occurrence were observed among 
these categories. 
<P>Maximum contaminant levels (MCLs)<STRONG> </STRONG>established by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water were exceeded for only one 
pesticide (atrazine &gt;= 3 µg/L) at a single location. However, MCLs have been 
established for only<STRONG> </STRONG>25 of the 46 pesticide compounds examined, 
do not cover pesticide degradates,<STRONG> </STRONG>and, at present,<STRONG> 
</STRONG>do not take into account additive or synergistic effects of 
combinations of pesticide compounds or potential effects on nearby aquatic 
ecosystems.
<P>
<H3><A name=intro>Introduction</A></H3>
<P>The widespread use of synthetic organic pesticides over the past half century 
has led to their detection in many hydrologic systems of the United States and 
other countries (<EM>1-4</EM>). Pesticide contamination of ground water is an 
issue of National importance in the United States because ground water is used 
for drinking water by about 50% of the population (<EM>5</EM>). 
<P>Numerous studies have examined the occurrence of pesticides in ground water 
of the United States over the past three decades, particularly in agricultural 
areas (urban areas have seldom been sampled). However, the designs of past 
studies vary widely with respect to factors such as their analytical scope and 
sensitivity, the types of wells sampled, and the land uses targeted, making 
consistent comparisons and assessments at regional and national scales difficult 
(<EM>3</EM>). The National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) examines ground- and 
surface-water quality on a National scale using a consistent study design with 
respect to these and other parameters (<EM>6, 7</EM>).
<P>For each NAWQA Study Unit, ground-water quality is assessed using three 
principal study components (<EM>7</EM>): surveys of existing wells in major 
aquifers (aquifer surveys), studies focused on shallow ground water underlying 
specific land uses (land-use studies), and investigations of ground-water 
quality along individual flowpaths (flowpath studies). A National assessment of 
ground-water quality---and the processes that control it---will ultimately be 
obtained by combining the results for all three study components from NAWQA 
Study-Unit investigations conducted across the country, building over time as 
Study Units are completed.
<P>This paper describes the pesticide results from the first set of ground-water 
land-use studies (31 agricultural and 10 urban) conducted in the first 20 NAWQA 
Study Units during 1993-1995. The objectives are: (1) to provide an initial 
summary of the concentrations and frequencies of detection of pesticide 
compounds in shallow ground water beneath agricultural and urban areas within a 
broad range of environmental settings across the Nation; and (2) to examine the 
extent to which pesticide occurrence in ground water beneath agricultural and 
urban areas is related to variations in the use and the physical and chemical 
properties of these compounds. Once the assembly of data from the first 20 NAWQA 
Study Units has been completed, the analysis will expand to a more detailed 
examination of factors affecting pesticide occurrence in ground 
water---including variations in hydrogeology, soil properties, well type, well 
construction, and agricultural management practices (e.g., irrigation and 
tillage). 
<P>
<H3><A name=meth>Materials and Methods</A></H3>
<P>The primary objective of each land-use study is to determine the quality of 
recently recharged ground water (generally within the past 10 years) beneath a 
specific land-use and hydrogeologic setting (<EM>7</EM>). The land-use studies 
provide a direct assessment of the effects of specific, recent human activities 
on ground-water quality, as well as an early warning of the potential for 
contamination of downgradient aquifers or nearby surface waters receiving 
ground-water discharge.<STRONG> </STRONG>To ensure that land-use study results 
from different Study Units are<STRONG> </STRONG>comparable, the ground-water 
sampling design of NAWQA employs consistent guidelines for selecting existing 
wells or locations for the installation of new wells (<EM>7-10</EM>). A total of 
1,012 wells and 22 springs <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig1.gif">(Figure 1)</A> were 
sampled for 41 land-use studies from June 1993 to March 1995. The features of 
these land-use studies are further described at <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/">http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/</A>
<P><STRONG>Sampling and Analytical Procedures. </STRONG>All samples were 
collected by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) personnel using protocols and 
procedures designed to obtain a water sample representative of the targeted 
aquifer (<EM>11, 12</EM>). Before water samples were collected, each site was 
pumped until field-measured values of pH, water temperature, specific 
conductance, and dissolved-oxygen concentration stabilized. After being passed 
through a 0.7-µm, baked, glass-fiber filter to remove suspended particles, 1 L 
of sample was either (a) stored in an amber, baked glass bottle and immediately 
chilled before and during shipment to the laboratory; or (b) pumped through a 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, which was then chilled<STRONG> 
</STRONG>and shipped to the laboratory. The effectiveness of the sampling 
protocol and the analytical procedures used for this study was verified through 
the routine analysis of blank, replicate, and spiked samples for quality control 
(<EM>11</EM>).
<P>In the laboratory, pesticide analytes were eluted from the SPE columns using 
a 3:1 hexane-isopropanol mixture. The resulting extracts were<STRONG> 
</STRONG>concentrated under a stream of nitrogen gas and analyzed for a total of 
46 pesticide compounds---25 herbicides, 17 insecticides, 2 herbicide 
transformation products (degradates), and 2 insecticide degradates---using 
capillary column gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (<EM>12</EM>). Although 
dieldrin---a discontinued insecticide---is classified as a parent compound in 
this paper <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 
1)</A>, it also can be derived from the <EM>in situ</EM> epoxidation of aldrin 
(<EM>16</EM>), another discontinued<STRONG> </STRONG>insecticide. The method 
detection limits (MDL) of the 46 pesticide compounds varied from 0.001 to 0.018 
µg/L <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 1)</A>, 
but these are provided only to indicate relative analytical precision and 
detection sensitivity and were not used as a lower limit for reporting 
concentrations that otherwise met compound identification criteria 
(<EM>12</EM>). Concentration values for detections below the MDL are designated 
as estimated values in the USGS data base.
<P>Land-Use Classification. Information on cropping patterns provides a useful 
surrogate for agrichemical use and, to a certain extent, climatic, soil, and 
hydrogeologic characteristics (<EM>17</EM>). The 31 agricultural land-use 
studies were grouped into nine categories according to the principal crops grown 
within each area, based on a classification system developed for a national 
water-quality assessment (<EM>18</EM>). 
<P><STRONG>Pesticide Use Data. </STRONG>To examine relations between the use and 
detection of pesticides in ground water, data on pesticide applications 
(<EM>19</EM>) were assembled for each sampled area. For each pesticide, the 
total amount of active ingredient applied to agricultural crops<STRONG> 
</STRONG>and pasture was estimated for every county containing one or more of 
the 813 agricultural sampling sites. The intensity of use (mass applied<STRONG> 
</STRONG>per unit area) for each compound was then computed by dividing the 
total amount applied in the sampled counties by the total area of cropland in 
these counties, including orchards, vineyards, citrus groves and pasture 
(<EM>20</EM>). The pesticide use data do not include applications to fallow land 
or non-agricultural areas (e.g., rights-of-way, lawns, golf courses, or sod 
farms), and thus do not include data for any of the counties sampled for the 10 
urban land-use studies. 
<P><STRONG>Physical and Chemical Properties of Pesticides. </STRONG>Data on some 
of the physical and chemical properties of pesticides were used to examine their 
relations to the detection of these compounds in ground water. The four 
parameters that have been<STRONG> </STRONG>used most frequently for this purpose 
are K<SUB>oc</SUB>, which describes the partitioning of organic compounds 
between water and soil organic carbon; Henry's Law Constant, which characterizes 
the partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases; water solubility, which 
provides an estimate of the maximum aqueous concentration likely to be 
encountered; and soil dissipation half-life, which serves as a rough indicator 
of persistence <EM>in situ</EM>.<STRONG> </STRONG>Values of K<SUB>oc</SUB>, 
water solubility, and soil dissipation half-life were obtained from various 
sources (<EM>21-26</EM>), while Henry's Law Constants were taken from the 
summary by Suntio <EM>et al</EM>. (<EM>27</EM>). Most literature values for soil 
dissipation half-life represent some unknown combination of the influences of 
transformation and off-site transport in reducing the concentration of a given 
compound at the point of measurement (<EM>3</EM>). Despite these uncertainties, 
the soil dissipation half-life was used as an approximate measure of 
persistence---instead of actual rate constants for transformation---because of 
the more widespread use and availability of this parameter.
<P><STRONG>Detection Frequencies.</STRONG> The detection frequencies for the 
pesticide compounds under investigation were calculated<STRONG> </STRONG>in two 
different ways, i.e., "unadjusted," based on all detections regardless of 
concentration <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 
1)</A>, and "adjusted," based on a common detection threshold for all compounds 
<A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 2)</A>. The 
use of unadjusted detection frequencies maximizes the ability to track the 
movement and fate of individual pesticides in the environment because every 
detection is included, with no loss of information. The unadjusted method, 
however, is inappropriate for comparing occurrence data among pesticide 
compounds with varying detection thresholds because frequencies of pesticide 
detection are inversely related to analytical reporting limits (<EM>3,28</EM>). 
The adjusted method applied a common detection threshold of 0.01 µg/L<STRONG> 
</STRONG>for computing detection frequencies, thus facilitating unbiased 
comparisons among compounds.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A name=res>Results and Discussion</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>Overall Frequencies of Pesticide Detection and Comparisons with 
Previous Multistate Studies. </STRONG>Detections of pesticide compounds were 
widespread in the shallow ground water sampled, with one or more pesticide 
compounds being detected in 54.4% of the 1,034 wells and springs 
sampled.<STRONG> </STRONG>Thirty-nine different pesticide compounds were 
detected <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 
1)</A>, 26 of which had at least one concentration above 0.01 µg/L <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 2)</A>.<STRONG> 
</STRONG>Consistent with findings from previous multistate studies 
(<EM>29</EM>), more than 95% of the reported pesticide concentrations were less 
than 1.0 µg/L <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig3.gif">(Figure 
3)</A>. With the exception of DDE, the results for the field blanks support the 
reliability of the pesticide data collected for this study <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 1)</A>. The 
relatively frequent detections of DDE in the field blanks compared to 
environmental samples will be examined in more detail to determine whether any 
of the DDE detections in the ground-water samples arose from either sampling or 
laboratory procedures.
<P>Herbicides were detected in shallow ground water much more frequently (52.4%) 
than were insecticides (7.5%). This pattern is consistent with early results 
reported by individual NAWQA Study Units (e.g., <EM>30-32</EM>) and may be a 
reflection of the fact that herbicides are used in much greater quantities than 
insecticides (e.g., <EM>33</EM>).<STRONG><EM> </STRONG></EM>Other factors, such 
as the persistence of the different compounds <EM>in situ</EM> or their method 
and timing of application, also may be important in contributing to the greater 
frequency of herbicide detection for this study, relative to the insecticides.
<P>The overall frequency of pesticide detection for the 41 land-use studies is 
considerably higher than those reported by two previous large-scale, multistate 
studies of pesticide occurrence in ground water<STRONG> </STRONG>across the 
United States. Estimates from the National Pesticide Survey (NPS) indicated that 
one or more pesticides were likely to be detected in the<STRONG> </STRONG>water 
from 10.4% of the<STRONG> </STRONG>public-supply and 4.2% of the<STRONG> 
</STRONG>domestic wells in the Nation from 1988 to 1990 (<EM>34</EM>). The 
National Alachlor Well Water Survey (NAWWS) projected that during the period 
from 1987 to 1989, one or more herbicides were likely to be detected in<STRONG> 
</STRONG>water obtained from 12% of the estimated 6 million existing domestic 
wells in counties in the United States where alachlor was sold (<EM>35</EM>). 
<P>The contrasts in pesticide detection frequencies between this study and the 
NPS and NAWWS investigations are<STRONG> </STRONG>attributable primarily to: 
(1)<STRONG> </STRONG>low detection threshold characteristics of the analytical 
method used for NAWQA, and (2)<STRONG> </STRONG>the relatively young age of 
ground water sampled in the NAWQA land-use studies. Frequencies of pesticide 
detection are inversely related to the detection threshold <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig3.gif">(Figure 3)</A>. For 
example, the NAWQA detection threshold for atrazine in figure 2 is 0.01 µg/L, 
whereas the reporting limits for the NAWWS, and NPS studies were 0.03 and 0.12 
µg/L, respectively. The frequencies of atrazine detection for the three studies 
decreased in the same order that the detection thresholds increased --- 27.7% <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 2)</A>, 11.68% 
(<EM>35</EM>), and 0.7% (<EM>34</EM>). Censoring the NAWQA atrazine data to the 
NPS and NAWWS reporting limits substantially decreases the atrazine detection 
frequency, but not to values as low as those for either the NPS or NAWWS 
investigations <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig3.gif">(Figure 
3)</A>. A likely contributor to the remaining difference is that NAWQA land-use 
studies focus on sampling only shallow, recently recharged ground water, while 
the NPS and NAWWS studies sampled ground water from existing wells tapping 
ground water with considerably broader ranges in age. Previous research has 
shown that "younger" ground water is more likely to contain pesticides at 
detectable concentrations than "older" waters (<EM>28, 36</EM>). 
<P><STRONG>Relations to Pesticide Use. </STRONG>Once variations in detection 
thresholds among the pesticide compounds have been accounted for <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 2)</A>, the 
reasons underlying the differences in frequencies of detection among the 
compounds can be examined. Previous work has demonstrated that variations in 
pesticide use are likely to affect the occurrence of pesticide compounds in 
ground water (<EM>3, 37</EM>). Since only limited data on non-agricultural use 
are available, the analysis of relations between occurrence and use was 
restricted to parent compounds with substantial present-day agricultural use, 
and thus excluded pesticides used primarily for non-agricultural purposes 
(prometon and tebuthiuron) or those that have been discontinued (dieldrin). 
Because of the focus on agricultural pesticides, the analysis was further 
limited to the data from the agricultural land-use studies. The pesticide use 
estimates employed in the correlation analysis are of total use in all counties 
included in the agricultural land-use studies. Consistent with expectation, a 
significant, positive relation was indeed observed between frequencies of 
detection <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 
2)</A> and estimated use (r = 0.36; p=0.02; Spearman rank correlation). Although 
significant, the weak correlation indicates that other factors also need to be 
considered to more accurately account variations in pesticide detections in 
ground water. Had it been available, specific information on chemical use within 
the vicinity of the sampled wells<STRONG>---</STRONG>rather than<STRONG> 
</STRONG>the estimated use throughout the surrounding counties---may have 
yielded a stronger relation between chemical use and pesticide detection 
frequencies in ground water<STRONG> </STRONG>for this study. Using the estimated 
use for each land-use study (discussed later in this paper), rather than the 
total in all counties, also may improve the relation between chemical use and 
pesticide detection frequencies. 
<P><STRONG>Relations to Pesticide Properties.</STRONG> Differences in subsurface 
mobility and persistence among different pesticides are commonly thought to 
contribute to variations in their frequencies of detection in ground water. 
Consequently, data on the physical and chemical properties of pesticides have 
often been used to predict the likelihood of their reaching ground water in 
detectable concentrations (<EM>3</EM>). 
<P>Frequencies of pesticide detection exhibited a significant, inverse 
correlation with K<SUB>oc</SUB> values (r=-0.57, P&lt;0.001; Spearman rank 
correlation), and a significant, positive correlation with water solubility 
(r=0.39, p=0.01; Spearman rank correlation), but correlations with soil 
dissipation half-life (p=0.12) and Henry's Law Constant (p=0.06) were not 
significant at &#945; = 0.05. The significant correlations with K<SUB>oc</SUB> and 
water solubility are in agreement with the anticipated effects of these 
parameters on pesticide detections in ground water. Furthermore, the observation 
of a stronger correlation of detection frequency with K<SUB>oc</SUB> than with 
water solubility is consistent with the fact that the value of<STRONG> 
</STRONG>K<SUB>oc</SUB> reflects the effects of soil organic matter on pesticide 
transport in the subsurface, while the use of water solubilities does not 
(<EM>3</EM>). The absence of a significant correlation between detection 
frequency and Henry's Law Constant is consistent with the comparatively low 
volatility of the pesticide compounds examined. The lack of a significant 
correlation with dissipation half-life is somewhat unexpected, but may be due to 
(A) the variable manner in which this parameter has been determined, (B) the 
fact that it represents some unknown combination of transformation and off-site 
transport (<EM>3</EM>), and (C) the limited range of dissipation half-live 
values exhibited by the compounds evaluated. 
<P>Improvements in explaining the frequencies of pesticide detection determined 
from this study are obtained by using a multivariate approach, taking 
information on both estimated use and physical properties into account. All 
variables were log-transformed for this analysis, which resulted in relatively 
normal distributions. The resulting correlation matrix for the transformed data 
indicated pairwise correlations that were similar to those observed from the 
rank correlation analysis. The amount of variance in the log-transformed 
frequencies of pesticide detection that was explained by these parameter was 
found to be 18% for estimates use alone (p=0.007; R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.18), 48% for 
estimated use + K<SUB>oc</SUB> (P&lt;0.001 for K<SUB>oc</SUB>; R<SUP>2</SUP> = 
0.48), and 52% for estimated use + K<SUB>oc</SUB> + soil dissipation half-life 
(p=0.10 for soil dissipation half-life; R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.52). Thus, consistent 
with the pair-wise analysis, dissipation half-life accounted for only a limited 
amount of the variation in pesticide detection frequency. Neither water 
solubility nor Henry's Law Constants could be included in this multivariate 
regression analysis because both were significantly correlated with 
K<SUB>oc</SUB>. Thus, among the parameters considered, estimated use and 
K<SUB>oc</SUB> have the most profound effect on determining pesticide occurrence 
in ground water.
<P>Following an approach analogous to that described by Baker et al., 
(<EM>38</EM>) for assessing ground-water vulnerability to pesticide 
contamination, each compound examined for the multivariate analysis was 
classified as having either a "high", "medium", or "low" likelihood of being 
detection in groundwater, based on specific threshold values for use (1.00 
kg/km<SUP>2</SUP> -- roughly the median intensity of use among these compounds) 
and K<SUB>oc</SUB> (300 ml/g (<EM>39</EM>)). This approach demonstrates that, as 
anticipated, the frequencies of detection of different compounds generally 
diminished as the "likelihood of detection" decreased <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig4.gif">(Figure 4)</A>.
<P><STRONG>Variations in Pesticide Detection Frequencies Among Land-Use 
Categories</STRONG>. Ten land-use categories were used for this study: corn and 
soybeans each &gt; 20% (corn &amp; soybeans &gt; 20); corn and alfalfa each &gt; 
20% (corn &amp; alfalfa &gt;20); corn &gt; 50% (corn &gt;50); peanuts &gt; 50% 
(peanuts &gt; 50); wheat and small grains &gt; 50% (wheat &gt; 50); wheat and 
small grains, and alfalfa each &gt; 20% (wheat &amp; alfalfa &gt;20); alfalfa 
&gt; 50% (alfalfa &gt; 50); pasture &gt; 90% (pasture); orchards or vineyards 
&gt; 50% (orchard/vineyard &gt;50); and urban areas (urban).
<P>Pesticide compounds were commonly detected in both agricultural (56.4%; 813 
sites) and urban (46.6%; 221 sites) settings. Frequent detections of pesticides 
in urban areas indicate that, as is the case for agricultural pesticide use in 
agricultural areas, urban and suburban pesticide use also significantly 
contribute to pesticide occurrence in shallow ground water. Although pesticides 
were detected in ground water sampled in all 10 of the land-use study 
categories, significant variations were observed in the frequencies of herbicide 
and insecticide detection among these categories (<A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">Table 1</A>; <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig5.gif">Figure 5</A>). For 
example, although the urban category ranked seventh in its median frequency of 
herbicide detection, it ranked second in its median frequency of insecticide 
detection <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig5.gif">(Figure 
5)</A>. Similar contrasts in insecticide detection frequencies between 
agricultural and urban areas have also been observed in streams (<EM>40, 
41</EM>).
<P>Considerable variations also were observed in the assemblages of pesticide 
compounds most frequently detected in each of the land-use categories <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig6.gif">(Figure 6).</A> Because 
the patterns of chemical use differ among these categories, these variations are 
not unexpected. Indeed, some of the variation in occurrence for a particular 
compound among the land-use categories can be explained by differences in the 
intensity of use. Statistically significant relations (P &lt; 0.05; Spearman's 
rank correlation) between overall frequencies of detection <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 1)</A> and the 
intensity of chemical use among different agricultural land use studies were 
observed for six of the pesticides detected: atrazine residue (atrazine or 
deethylatrazine; r = 0.402, P = 0.025), cyanazine (r = 0.435, P = 0.014), DCPA 
(r = 0.426, P = 0.017), metolachlor (r = 0.742, P &lt; 0.001), metribuzin (r = 
0.361, P = 0.046), and pendimethalin (r = 0.412, P = 0.021).
<P>Atrazine residues were detected more frequently than any other pesticide 
compounds during this study (<A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">Table</A> 1, <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">Figure 2</A>), with 
occurrences in 9 of the 10 land-use categories <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig6.gif">(Figure 6)</A>. The 
widespread detections of atrazine residues in ground water are likely to have 
been the combined result of the comparatively slow rate of atrazine 
transformation under environmental conditions (<EM>42-44</EM>)<STRONG> 
</STRONG>and the extensive, long-term use of the herbicide in both agricultural 
and non-agricultural settings in this country (<EM>45</EM>). Indeed, atrazine 
has been the pesticide used most extensively in the United States since the 
early 1970's (<EM>46, 47</EM>) and has been the parent compound detected most 
frequently in ground water during many previous regional (<EM>34, 35, 48</EM>), 
statewide (<EM>49-51</EM>), and NAWQA studies (<EM>32, 52-54</EM>). A 
statistically significant relation between the intensity of agricultural 
atrazine use and the frequency of atrazine-residue detection in ground water 
among different agricultural land-use studies ground water was observed <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig7.gif">(Figure 7)</A>. 
<P>The relation shown in <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig7.gif">Figure 7</A> mimics those 
commonly observed between pesticide detection frequencies and pesticide use, 
wherein relatively infrequent detections occur at low use, but a broad range of 
detection frequencies are encountered at higher use (<EM>3</EM>). Intensive 
pesticide use thus appears to be a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for 
encountering high frequencies of pesticide detection in ground water. The wider 
ranges in pesticide detection frequencies observed at higher use are presumed to 
reflect the varying influence of other factors in addition to use in governing 
pesticide detection rates among different areas (e.g., soil properties, 
hydrogeology and recharge rates). 
<P>The clustering that is displayed among land-use studies conducted in similar 
agricultural settings <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig7.gif">(Figure 7)</A> is likely 
to have arisen from similarities in one or more of these environmental factors 
among the study areas of interest. For example, the 
<STRONG>c</STRONG>omparatively low frequencies of atrazine-residue detection in 
the corn &amp; soybean&gt;20 category <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig7.gif">(Figure 7)</A><STRONG> 
</STRONG>may be attributable to hydrogeologic factors such as low soil 
permeability and high soil organic matter content<STRONG> </STRONG>in the areas 
studied. Conversely, the two land-use studies in the wheat &gt;50 category that 
exhibited unexpectedly high atrazine-residue detection frequencies were noted to 
have permeable soils and intensive irrigation---two factors known to facilitate 
the movement of pesticides to ground water (<EM>55-58</EM>).
<P>In addition to atrazine, several other pesticide compounds also merit some 
discussion. Prometon is used primarily for non-agricultural purposes; such as 
domestic and commercial applications to driveways, fence lines, lawns and 
gardens, and as an asphalt additive (<EM>59-61</EM>). Prometon was detected in 
eight of the 10 land-use categories<STRONG>---</STRONG>most frequently in the 
urban setting <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 
1)</A><STRONG>---</STRONG>and<STRONG> </STRONG>was the third most frequently 
detected parent compound for this study <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">(Figure 2)</A>. Relations 
to chemical use could not be examined because no nationwide compilations of 
prometon use are currently available. Consistent with its predominantly 
non-agricultural use, however, the frequency of prometon detection was 
significantly related to the median percentage of urban land within 1 km of the 
sampled sites for each land-use study (p=0.042; Spearman rank correlation). 
Previous research has<STRONG> </STRONG>also documented a direct relation between 
urban-residential land use and prometon detections in ground water (<EM>62, 
63</EM>), as well as in surface water (<EM>41</EM>).
<P>Dieldrin (a<STRONG> </STRONG>degradate of aldrin as well as<STRONG> 
</STRONG>an insecticide itself) is an organochlorine insecticide that was 
detected in ground water during this study (<A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">Table 1</A>, <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/fig2.gif">Figure 2</A>), even 
though both dieldrin and aldrin have been banned from normal agricultural use in 
the United States since the mid-1970's (dieldrin was cancelled for termiticidal 
use in 1987). While the concentrations and detection frequencies for dieldrin 
were quite low by comparison with many of the other pesticide compounds under 
investigation, the potential of this compound to accumulate to levels toxic to 
humans and aquatic life is much greater (<EM>64</EM>). As has been observed by 
other studies (e.g., <EM>65-67</EM>),<STRONG> </STRONG>organochlorine 
insecticides continue to exert a negative impact on ground-water quality decades 
after having been banned from normal use.
<P>
<H3><A name=sig>Significance to Human and Environmental Health</A></H3>
<P>Pesticides were commonly detected in shallow ground water for this study, but 
their concentrations rarely exceeded current drinking-water criteria established 
by the USEPA for the protection of human health <A 
href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 1)</A>. The 
concentration of atrazine exceeded its Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 3 µg/L 
in one well, and dieldrin concentrations exceeded the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> 
Risk-Specific Dose of 0.002 µg/L (corresponding to a risk of one additional 
person contracting cancer out of one million people) in 14 wells. 
<P>The relative infrequency with which pesticides exceeded drinking-water 
criteria, however, may not provide a complete assessment of the overall health 
and environmental risks associated with the presence of pesticides in shallow 
ground water. First, water-quality criteria for the protection of human health 
have only been established for 25 of the 46 pesticide compounds examined for 
this study <A href="http://water.wr.usgs.gov/pnsp/ja/est32/table1.gif">(Table 
1)</A>. Second, these drinking-water criteria only consider the effects of 
individual compounds and do not account for the presence of more than one 
pesticide compound; some studies indicate that combinations of pesticide 
compounds may exhibit additive or even synergistic toxic effects (<EM>68, 
69</EM>). In this study, 73% of the sampling sites where pesticides were 
detected had two or more compounds present, 25% had four or more, and 6% had six 
or more compounds present. Third, other<STRONG> </STRONG>pesticide compounds not 
examined for this study<STRONG>---</STRONG>particularly pesticide 
degradates<STRONG>---</STRONG>have been detected in ground water (e.g., <EM>37, 
70, 71</EM>) that also could have potential health effects (e.g., <EM>72, 
73</EM>). Fourth, recent research also suggests that some pesticide compounds 
may cause deleterious health effects at levels considered safe by current 
standards (<EM>67, 74, 75</EM>). Finally, drinking water criteria do not account 
for potential effects of pesticide compounds on aquatic ecosystems (e.g., 
<EM>66, 76</EM>). Several exceedences of criteria for the protection of 
freshwater aquatic life (<EM>14, </EM><EM>77</EM>) were observed during the 
present study (atrazine &gt;= 2.0 µg/L at 4 sites; carbaryl &gt;=0.02 µg/L at 3 
sites; diazinon &gt;=0.009 µg/L at 5 sites; dieldrin &gt;=0.005 µg/L at 13 
sites); such exceedences may be significant to the health of aquatic ecosystems 
receiving ground-water discharge near the sampling locations of interest.
