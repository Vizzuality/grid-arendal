    <TD><FONT face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=2>Global changes in 
      the weather have increased disasters. People in many countries in the 
      world are suffering from serious damage both to life and property. 
      <P align=left>The Government and people of Viet Nam have long-standing 
      disaster prevention traditions and always bring them into play. From 
      generation to generation, Vietnamese people have strengthened dykes, built 
      flood protection structures, and applied appropriate measures for disaster 
      mitigation. 
      <P align=left>In May 1946, as soon as the Peoples&#8217; Democratic State was 
      established, President Ho Chi Minh issued a decree to organize the Central 
      Committee for Dyke Protection &#8211; now the Central Committee for Flood and 
      Storm Control (CCFSC). The CCFSC has been increasingly strengthened to 
      play an important role in disaster mitigation. 
      <P align=left>The United Nations General Assembly designated the 1990s as 
      the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. In response, the 
      Government of Viet Nam organized the National Committee for the 
      International Decade for Disaster Reduction. The CCFSC is its most active 
      member, and has the following tasks: 
      <P align=left>
      <UL>
        <LI>Developing programmes, plans, and measures for disaster reduction in 
        coordination with other agencies, mass organizations, related social 
        organizations, and science and technology research institutes. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Directing the implementation of disaster mitigation activities. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Coordinating with international organizations to increase 
        cooperation on disaster mitigation in Viet Nam. </LI></UL>
      <P align=left>Since 1997, a number of intense disasters have caused severe 
      ordeals for the Vietnamese people, quite apart from those that usually 
      strike the country. In November 1997, Typhoon Linda hit the coastal area 
      of southern Viet Nam, the country&#8217;s major aqua-production area, which is 
      rarely hit by storms. It caused massive losses to human life and property. 
      Thousands of fishermen were killed and thousands of fishing ships and 
      boats were sunk or damaged. 
      <P align=left>However, under the Government&#8217;s close direction, agencies at 
      all levels strengthened research and rescue capacities. As a result, more 
      than 5,000 people were saved, and tens of thousands of others were 
      evacuated to safe places and supported in stabilizing their lives. As soon 
      as the typhoon abated, the Government took prompt decisions to help local 
      people rapidly overcome its aftermath and resume productivity, thus 
      reducing the damage. 
      <P align=left>In November and December 1999, two terribly heavy spells of 
      rain inundated a large area of central Viet Nam, causing massive losses. 
      However, the people of the area were supported by agencies at all levels 
      in overcoming the aftermath of the floods and, with the valuable help of 
      people throughout the whole country, overcame all difficulties, rapidly 
      stabilizing life and renewing production. <BR>

            encouragement of the international community has been very valuable

            disasters</B></I></FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Disasters again 
      caused much damage in the country the next year. Severe floods occurred in 
      the Mekong River system at the beginning of July 2000 and became the worst 
      in 70 years in this populous area, the country&#8217;s biggest rice bowl. These 
      &#8211; as well as a cyclone and flash floods in other areas of the country &#8211; 
      caused massive losses to human life and property. 
      <P align=left>The Party and the State took prompt action to encourage 
      forces at all levels to cope with floods and other disasters so as to 
      minimize damage. The Government made decisive policy decisions for each 
      part of the country, based on their geographical and climatological 
      features and disaster conditions, as follows: 
      <P align=left>
      <UL>
        <LI>Northern Viet Nam: The policy is to strengthen the system of dykes 
        and structures to retard and divert floods, to improve the flood 
        resistance of construction, and to protect essential populated and 
        economic areas. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Central Viet Nam: Central Viet Nam is narrow with complicated 
        topography and is frequently affected by storms. Consequently rainwater 
        is rapidly concentrated into floods. The policy is to supplement active 
        measures for preventing and mitigating floods and familiarizing people 
        with them. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Mekong River Delta: The policy is to prepare measures for living 
        with floods and to minimize the damage they cause. </LI></UL>
      <P align=left>Despite the achievements of the last ten years, some 
      problems still need to be studied further. With the direction of the 
      Central Party and the Government, the CCFSC coordinates with other 
      agencies at all levels and with mass organizations to carry out action 
      programmes for disaster prevention to minimize disaster damage. It also 
      acts as a consultant to the Government on preparing for disasters, 
      responding to them, and overcoming their consequences &#8211; and in switching 
      disaster mitigation activities from the defensive to the offensive. 
      <P align=left>When natural disasters occur, therefore, response activities 
      and damage assessment will be actively carried out and the consequences of 
      disaster rapidly overcome. 
      <P align=left>We can learn from experience in disaster prevention, 
      response, and mitigation, both in Viet Nam and abroad, to focus on: 
      <P align=left>
      <UL>
        <LI>Improving the gathering of disaster forecast information, organizing 
        warnings in a timely way, and taking measures in disaster-affected 
        localities. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Mobilizing all forces from all social strata for disaster 
        prevention. The armed forces, in particular, should be considered as a 
        core in search and rescue activities, and in dealing with 
        disaster-threatened construction. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Mobilizing the &#8216;mutual affection and mutual love&#8217; spirit of the 
        community to help people affected by a disaster in overcoming its 
        consequences. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Regularly learning from experience after disaster to respond 
        promptly, to supplement mitigation measures, and to strengthen disaster 
        coordination to obtain high levels of efficiency. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Strengthening the system of information flow from central to local 
        levels; strictly stipulating the regime for disseminating information to 
        serve disaster prevention and mitigation. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Enhancing community disaster awareness activities; diversifying 
        communications so that all people can understand disasters well and be 
        able to respond to every situation. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Extending research into all types of natural disasters to find the 
        appropriate measures needed to minimize damage; to improve the 
        efficiency of the four &#8216;on-the-spots&#8217; &#8211; directions on-the-spot; forces 
        on-the-spot; materials on-the-spot; and logistics on-the-spot &#8211; 
        particularly in rehabilitating structures for flood and storm control; 
        and to enhance the role of the military, working in close cooperation 
        with local authorities. 
        <P align=left></P>
        <LI>Developing a framework strategy for disaster mitigation for the 
        whole country, based on each disaster zone. </LI></UL>
      <P align=left>In preparing for disasters, responding to them, and 
      overcoming their consequences, the Vietnamese people welcome the 
      encouragement, new technologies, and disaster-prevention equipment they 
      receive from the international community and United Nations agencies. 
      Because of this, the CCFSC and local committees for flood and storm 
      control can improve their capacity to mitigate disasters. 
      <P align=left>Humanitarian aid relief from the international community, 
      governments, non-governmental organizations and other benefactors has 
      eased the losses and grief of the Vietnamese people. I would like, on 
      behalf of the Government and people of Viet Nam, to acknowledge and 
      express our gratitude for their very precious assistance. 
      <P align=left>On 11 October &#8211; the International Day for Disaster Reduction 
      &#8211; Viet Nam with other countries and individuals was awarded the 
      Certificate of Distinction for Disaster Reduction for the year 2000 by the 
      United Nations. The encouragement of the United Nations and the 
      international community has been very valuable in helping the Vietnamese 
      people in their prolonged and difficult fight against natural disasters
