<P>It is our contention in discussing the future of Integrated Pest Management 
that this strategic approach to pest regulation is closely allied to the future 
of systems devoted to production and distribution of plant and animal 
commodities whether in rural or urban settings. As a sustainable approach 
combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to regulate pest 
populations while minimizing economic, environmental, and human health risks, 
IPM combines essential aspects of efficacy and safety to meet expectations of 
those who produce and market commodities and of the general public. The 
traditional focus of those involved with production of commodities has resulted 
in investment of tremendous resources for IPM in agriculture for research, 
educational endeavors, and for applications on-farm. It is becoming increasingly 
apparent, however, that principles of IPM have utility in virtually any 
situation where some species have been ascribed pest status. For example, in 
nursery and greenhouse ornamental production reliance solely on chemical 
pesticides to limit insect and disease problems is giving way to IPM. In 
storage, processing, and distribution systems for cereal grains, unilateral 
reliance on chemicals for management of a variety of pests (insects, rodents, 
and microorganisms) is evolving toward integrated approaches with greater 
emphasis on sanitation, aeration of stored grains, even stocking plans for 
reducing infestations once packaged products have reached grocery store shelves 
(Cuperus and Platt 1996, Kenkel et al. 1994).</P>
<P>We acknowledge that the vision we are describing for IPM as an essential 
aspect of all production and distribution systems for plant and animal 
commodities implies much broader awareness and acceptance by those working with 
these commodities than currently exists. Certainly, education of those working 
in production and distribution systems regarding alternatives to pesticides must 
be a priority. Integrated control programs with employment of cultural measures, 
host resistance, and biological agents along with attention to appropriate 
decision-making processes for application of pesticides must be emphasized.</P>
<P>And yet, the awareness and acceptance cannot end with those employed in these 
systems, but must be extended to consumers. We must strive for a general 
understanding of IPM as the means for effective regulation of pest species that 
stresses safety for the human population and for the environment in which we 
live. We propose that public awareness of IPM extend to moderation in use of 
pesticides and consideration of alternative controls in the home gardens and 
households of the urban population. Public understanding must be expanded beyond 
vague misgivings about food safety to include an appreciation of the potential 
for pests to limit our food supply, as well as, knowledge of the decisions that 
must be made for proper employment of pest management techniques. Our basic 
contention that the future of IPM is closely allied to the future of plant and 
animal production systems must be appreciated by the general public. The public 
must view development and implementation of IPM as a sound investment of 
resources.</P>
<P>While there is abundant scientific evidence to support our basic contention 
of an essential role for IPM, we believe that the most critical considerations 
that recommend adoption, at least for the short term, are demographic and 
sociological in nature. The number of farms in the U.S. has declined by about 
25% in just the last 20 years, with those remaining having larger land holdings 
such that about 15% of farms now produce about 85% of all food and fiber 
(National Research Council 1989). With less than 2% of the U.S. population 
directly involved with commercial agriculture, tremendous challenges in 
education and communication must be met in building a public consensus for the 
importance of IPM in sustaining a wholesome, abundant food supply, and 
maintaining safe environments for humans and other species. If strong support 
for IPM exists only in production agriculture, the public interest and political 
will to provide necessary resources for development and implementation will not 
exist for the future. This is clearly indicated by the fact that research and 
extension programs of the Land Grant University System continue to be reduced in 
size as funding sources dwindle. Unless relevance and service to a largely urban 
population is emphasized, this trend seems certain to continue.</P>
<P>In a trend that is often considered to have gained impetus with publications 
such as "Silent Spring" (Carson 1962) and "Only One Earth" (Ward and Dubos 
1972), concerns for food safety, environmental contamination, endangered 
species, and safety of farm workers continue to escalate. Sachs et al. (1987) 
reported a dramatic increase in concerns of consumers over a 25-year period 
regarding agricultural production practices. Limited trust in those who produce 
food and those whose role it is to enforce regulations insuring food safety 
appears to stem from several factors including lack of understanding of 
agricultural systems, little knowledge of pest management or pesticides, and 
dread of cancer. Health and well-being are highly valued by society today, 
resulting in demands for a safe, wholesome food supply that is produced without 
harm to the environment or hazards to those who work in agriculture (Tables 1 
and 2). Though the general public appears to believe that use of pesticides 
constitutes the most critical hazard to the food supply (Cuperus et al. 1991, 
Pomerantz 1995), many scientists consider contamination by microorganisms to be 
a much greater threat. There is a critical need for improved understanding of 
the hazards posed by bacterial and fungal contaminants in food commodities and 
the role of IPM in reducing these hazards.<BR><BR></P>

<P>As may be expected, concerns of the general public have resulted in 
increasingly stringent regulation of pesticides with the latest action of the 
U.S. Congress being passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. 
Provisions of this act reflect a definite response by lawmakers to hazards 
perceived by consumers and a comprehensive attempt to address the perceived 
dangers associated with use of pesticides:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>additional safeguards for infants and children relating to pesticide 
  residues in food based on the assumption that they consume proportionately 
  more fresh fruits and vegetables than adults. Tolerances for residues in fresh 
  produce must reflect this added margin of safety.<BR>
  <LI>mandatory review of "high-risk" pesticides which may result in 
  cancellation of registrations for many organophosphate and carbamate 
  insecticides.<BR>
  <LI>one national standard for pesticide tolerances with elimination of 
  provisions for tolerances set by state or local governments.<BR>
  <LI>more information to consumers about pesticide residues in food. The EPA is 
  charged with compiling and distributing material through grocers to describe 
  risks and benefits of pesticides and ways in which consumers can reduce their 
  exposure to these agents.<BR>
  <LI>accelerated registration procedure for compounds that will reduce risks of 
  pesticide exposure for humans, other nontarget organisms, or the environment. 
  </LI></UL>
<P>The Food Quality Protection Act will require extensive education of those who 
work in food production, processing, and distribution systems regarding use of 
pesticides. New provisions relating to tolerances for pesticide residues in food 
commodities will necessitate planning throughout these systems to evaluate the 
potential cumulative human exposure to residues of certain classes of pesticides 
used in a variety of food products. This is just the type of comprehensive 
approach that will allow IPM practitioners to relate key food safety components 
to plans for managing pest populations as crops and livestock are raised, food 
commodities are processed, and products are distributed to consumers.</P>
<P>The manner in which food commodities are marketed has typically not been 
integrated into decision support systems for IPM. The fact that commodity values 
may fluctuate by 50-100% depending upon the produce quality, detection of 
pesticide residues, and timely availability to meet demand must be considered as 
decisions pertaining to pest management are made. For example, market demand and 
value of fresh fruits and vegetables have reflected consumer concerns as 
indicated by increasing sales of organically-grown produce and that labeled as 
grown under IPM systems (northeastern U.S.). It is important that practitioners 
understand market trends and design pest management programs to assure quality, 
minimize pesticide residues, and preserve the identity of commodities as to 
production history and location. The following are factors that influence the 
marketability of food products:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>consumer demand for cosmetically-perfect produce without pesticide 
  residues.<BR>
  <LI>concern of food processors relating to pesticide residues in fresh 
  produce. (Over 50% of processors have changed purchasing contracts to minimize 
  residues in their products).<BR>
  <LI>surveys indicate that over 50% of grocers will test fresh produce for 
  pesticide residues, yet 98% indicate that they have not heard of 
IPM.<BR></LI></UL>
<P>Another area of concern regarding continued use of chemical pesticides is the 
growing problem of contamination of ground and surface water supplies. As an 
example of the magnitude of this problem in some regions, Christensen and Rea 
(1993) reported the presence of pesticide residues in water from over 40% of 
private wells in the Oklahoma City area. With the tremendous reliance on ground 
water supplies for domestic use (20,000 wells in the Oklahoma City area alone) 
these residues are definitely cause for concern. It is important to note that 
many instances of contamination of water supplies result not from agricultural 
use of pesticides, but from use by urban populations. A recent national survey 
confirmed the presence of diazinon residues in 7,230 of 23,227 samples of sewage 
effluent being released from municipalities into surface water supplies 
(Norber-King et al. 1989). These residues resulted from urban homeowner use and 
disposal of this pesticide. Contamination of water is but one impact that Higley 
and Wintersteen (1992) considered in assessing an environmental cost as part of 
economic injury levels for decision-making processes relating to pesticide 
applications. While their proposal dealt primarily with applications in 
agriculture, findings just discussed indicate that the same rational should be 
related to urban settings. Kovach et al. (1992) suggested formulation of a 
pesticide use index applicable to decision-making that would consider threats to 
human health and environmental impacts as a means by which users may be assessed 
for environmental costs accruing from use of pesticides. If these costs are 
assessed when products are sold, urbanites and agriculturists would share the 
burden of rectifying problems that result from use of these compounds.</P>
<P>Economic considerations often rank foremost among factors that influence 
decisions relating to pest management. These considerations have been basic to 
IPM since its inception in the earliest definitions for the <B>economic 
threshold</B> and <B>economic injury level</B> (Stern et al. 1959). These 
parameters have not only served as criteria for decisions regarding the use of 
chemical pesticides in many plant and animal production systems, but have also 
helped to define the goal of effective pest management. Rather than an 
insistence on complete eradication of pests, an understanding is developing 
among practitioners of IPM that maintaining pest populations below the economic 
injury level by use of all available control methods is indeed successful 
control. There remains, however, a perception that using economic thresholds as 
criteria for management decisions increases the risk of economic losses. The 
perceived risk is that sampling plans and decision criteria are inadequate with 
the result that pesticide applications may not be made when they are needed. 
This perception is often cited as a major limiting factor preventing the 
adoption of IPM (Cuperus and Berberet 1994).</P>
<P>While progress been made in defining simple economic thresholds and economic 
injury levels, especially for key insect pests, much research is needed for 
development of comprehensive thresholds for insect pests, pathogens, and weeds. 
Also, there has been relatively little accomplished in terms of integrating 
economic considerations relating to pest management activities into 
comprehensive benefit/cost analyses for agricultural enterprises. 
Decision-making criteria for pest control activities in settings other than 
agricultural production have scarcely been addressed in research or extension 
efforts. While it is clear that the criteria applicable to urban settings will 
not be the same as those used in agriculture, value judgements should still be 
made as to the necessity for measures such as pesticides. It is of vital 
importance that these considerations be introduced to people in urban settings 
so that they have the opportunity to make informed choices regarding chemicals 
introduced into their environment and to develop an appreciation for the 
decisions that must be made in agriculture.</P>
<P>We have described a variety of factors that appear to have "forced the issue" 
with regard to implementation of integrated approaches to pest management in 
production of agricultural commodities. However, it is not our intention to 
imply that development and adoption of IPM strategies has occurred only in 
response to social and economic pressures. Indeed, a great deal of research and 
extension effort has been devoted to IPM by scientists within the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and the Land Grant System because of strong 
convictions that integrated approaches are essential to regulation of pest 
species over the long term. Also, the balance among social, environmental, and 
economic considerations has been a central theme of IPM since its inception. 
This theme is consistent with expectations for the entire system of agricultural 
production. The extent to which balance among these considerations can be 
maintained depends greatly on understanding and acceptance of IPM methods by the 
public and the degree to which principles of IPM are implemented in both rural 
and urban settings.</P>
<P>Over the past 20-30 years, scientists in the Land Grant Universities and 
groups within the USDA such as the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and 
Economic Research Service (ERS) have conducted extensive research to develop 
integrated control programs for reduced reliance on chemical pesticides and to 
restructure processes by which decisions are made regarding applications of 
pesticides. Central to this restructuring process has been the replacement of 
prophylactic treatments with careful assessment of potential losses due to pests 
and development of economic thresholds to provide guidelines for decisions 
regarding pesticide applications. Out of this work has come scouting procedures 
and decision-making criteria for controlling many key pests of crops and 
livestock. Not only did these public agencies have the primary role in 
researching IPM strategies, at one time, they were also the priciple proponents 
and implementers of these approaches. Although private concerns had little part 
in this initial development and implementation, the future will bring greatly 
increased involvement by the private entities, particularly with regard to 
adoption of IPM. It is important that effective partnerships be established and 
maintained among public agencies and private entrepreneurs. It is also important 
that farmers, nurserymen, and others who use IPM in their businesses are part of 
implementation teams.</P>
<P>Scientists in public agencies are being joined by those in the private sector 
in a major role to expand the research base for improvement of IPM programs and 
promote essential coordination among disciplines such as Agronomy, Entomology, 
Horticulture, Plant Pathology, and Economics.</P>
<P>Benefits of this cooperation include:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>technology for variable rate sensing to adjust applications of 
  agrichemicals for specific needs of crops within fields.<BR>
  <LI>precision agriculture that integrates elements such as global positioning 
  and laser technology with emphases on whole farm management systems to 
  maximize profitability.<BR>
  <LI>application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to management of 
  agroecosystems to maximize inputs such as agrichemicals while reducing 
  problems of soil and water pollution. The Oklahoma Ag-Chems Project is an 
  example designed to anticipate problems of soil and water pollution resulting 
  from applications of pesticides and fertilizers.<BR>
  <LI>Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) technologies to define 
  critical control points within production and processing systems. This 
  technology is intended to monitor stages in production or processing where 
  risk of microbial or pesticide contamination may be greatest (Cuperus et al. 
  1991).<BR>
  <LI>decision support software developed in both public and private sectors 
  that allows IPM practitioners to complete cost/benefit estimates for a variety 
  of management inputs such as pesticide applications or examine profitability 
  of whole-farm systems.<BR>
  <LI>genetically engineered plants and animals with characteristics to enhance 
  productivity and reduce damage due to a variety of pest groups. Current 
  examples include <I>Bt</I> cotton, <I>Bt</I> corn, and glyphosate-resistant 
  soybeans.<BR>
  <LI>movement of pest management in urban areas from unilateral control of 
  pests with chemical pesticides to integrated methods that emphasize 
  inspections and problem identification, with sanitation, traps, and other 
  non-chemical controls employed to regulate pests (Bennett and Owens 
  1986).<BR></LI></UL>
<P>The scope of IPM implementation will continue to change greatly in the 
future. What began as limited approaches to promote integration of control 
methods for key pests and provide guidelines for decisions regarding pesticide 
applications is evolving to an ecologically-based systems approach (Cate and 
Hinckle 1994). Where there was once limited cooperation among disciplines, now 
there are teams comprised of scientists from several disciplines that work with 
consultants and producers to incorporate effective pest management into 
production systems. The complexity of these systems requires a broad base of 
expertise to address issues such as timing and efficacy of pest control 
recommendations; dealing with the ever-growing problem of pesticide resistance; 
addressing issues of worker safety; avoiding pollution of soils and water by 
agrichemicals; and assuring that foods contain no harmful residues of 
pesticides. While these issues must be dealt with for the forseeable future, it 
is important to assure an effective transition from pest control programs with 
heavy reliance on chemical pesticides to ecologically-based biointensive IPM. A 
recent report by the Consumers Union states that the way we control pest 
problems is at a crossroads with the necessity of decreasing reliance on 
chemical-dependent approaches becoming steadily more evident (Benbrook et al. 
1996). An organizational strategy must be adopted to increase acceptance of 
integrated approaches by; 1) providing intensive educational outreach involving 
coordinated efforts of extension specialists, industry representatives, and 
private consultants, and 2) emphasizing regional and national coordination for 
preparation and dissemination of educational materials.</P>
<P>Those who develop and implement IPM technology must be proactive in design of 
information delivery systems. This challenge has several aspects including 
effective communication of research information to extension specialists to 
promote the formulation and delivery of integrated programs; providing timely 
advisories of the status of pest populations so essential to adoption of 
ecologically-based programs by IPM practitioners; and feedback to scientists 
from practitioners regarding effectiveness of programs. Also, the traditional 
flow of information from researcher, to extension specialist, to practitioner is 
being changed to include crop consultants and representatives of agribusiness. 
Current trends indicate that cooperative extension is becoming a secondary 
supplier of information, especially that regarding treatment advisories, with 
private sources assuming an increasing role (Cuperus and Berberet 1994) (Tables 
3 and 4).<BR><BR></P>

<P>The following give additional evidence of trends toward private entities for 
delivery of information to those who produce agricultural commodities:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>certified crop advisors have increased from none in 1990 to over 20,000 in 
  1996 (Reetz 1997). 
  <LI>independent crop consultants have increased from 0 in 1978 to current 
  levels of over 450 companies in 40 states (Reetz 1997). 
  <LI>vertical integration through contracts that specify production and pest 
  management methods used for fruits, vegetables, meat, and some other 
  agricultural commodities is having a great influence on the means by which 
  information is transferred to growers. 
  <LI>while the private industry has greatly expanded its activities in relation 
  to overall crop management, including IPM, the extension staff in many states 
  has been reduced as much as 33%, with remaining employees devoting much more 
  time to environmental and social issues at the expense of traditional 
  agricultural emphases.<BR></LI></UL>
<P>While the challenge of information transfer to IPM practitioners in 
agriculture is great, that of communicating with the urban population is even 
greater. We have stated the contention that those in urban settings must be 
actively engaged in making informed decisions to maintain the quality of their 
environment, as well as, having an understanding of issues that assure a safe 
and abundant supply of food and fiber from agricultural production systems for 
the future. Delivery systems such as mass media and the internet must be 
employed to reach the large numbers of people who reside in urban areas 
(Thompson and Kelvin 1996). Modest programs that have begun in schools to 
promote environmental awareness in a more global sense may be expanded to teach 
young people how to preserve the quality of urban environments where they live. 
The grower meetings, field days, and fact sheets which have been the mainstay of 
agricultural extension work will never reach the volume of people necessary for 
educational outreach in towns and cities. Much work remains to prepare the 
organizational framework and enlist the personnel required for this educational 
effort.</P>
<P>In summary, we believe that the principles of IPM are essential to 
sustainability of agricultural production systems. Implementation of IPM 
programs is essential to profitable production of a safe and wholesome food 
supply while minimizing hazards of environmental pollution that could threaten 
entire ecosystems. To make the transition from chemically-based to 
ecologically-based pest management strategies, production and processing systems 
must be aggressive in developing the human and information resources required. 
Only through enhancement of research and educational resources will safety and 
profitability of food and fiber production and processing be assured. A unique 
opportunity exists now for IPM to bring great benefits to both agricultural and 
urban environments.<BR></P>
