      <H4 align=center></FONT><FONT face=arial size=3>Southern Africa Vision For 
      Water, Life &amp; the Environment in the 21st Century</FONT><FONT

      <H5 align=center><I>The people of Southern Africa call for a desirable 
      future in which the region's energy needs are provided for on an equitable 
      and sustainable basis with minimum negative impacts on water and the 
      environment</I> </H5>
      <H4>The present situation</H4>
      <P>The people of Southern Africa recognise that water is essential to 
      their own personal and community survival, to the production of the food 
      that they eat and to their sanitation and the conveyance of waste. Water 
      also is essential to the generation of the energy that supplies their 
      needs, the commodities that they produce for national consumption and 
      export and the integrity of the environment and the survival of other 
      living forms with whom they share the world. </P>
      <P>They recognise that the present &#8220;water world&#8221; in Southern Africa 
      contains many situations that are evolving. Some of the situations are 
      undesirable. These include: 
      <UL type=disc>
        <LI>A rapidly growing population that continues to impose <B>increasing 
        demands on water resources. </B>
        <LI>A rapidly urbanising population that places <B>increasing stress on 
        both the water resources and the necessary infrastructure</B> needed to 
        sustain an urban environment. 
        <LI>Widespread and <B>increasing poverty</B> which is both a cause and a 
        result of environmental degradation, including the degradation of water 
        resources. 
        <LI><B>Widespread food insecurity</B> resulting from the vagaries of 
        nature and, in part, from non-optimal agricultural uses of water. 
        <LI><B>Inadequate coverage of water and sanitation services</B> 
        especially among the urban, peri-urban and rural poor. 
        <LI><B>Disease and premature death from water-related illnesses</B> 
        continue to be dominant, in part as a result of lack of knowledge and 
        lack of capacity that can be addressed through inter-sectoral 
        water-related actions. 
        <LI>Dependence on agriculture and other water-related activities such as 
        fishery for livelihoods in the region calls for <B>integrated water 
        resources development and management </B>and this is still at it's early 
        infancy in the region. 
        <LI>Polluted water bodies due to <B>poor waste management and lack of 
        accountability</B> against a backdrop of lack of resources and 
        inadequate capacity for effective enforcement action that is often 
        already stipulated in national legislation in the region. 
        <LI><B>Low levels of energy supply.</B> 
        <LI><B>Degraded watersheds</B> that now require vast resources to 
        maintain or improve. 
        <LI>Trans-boundary river basins with complex water rights issues that 
        call for international cooperation, an issue <B>already being addressed 
        by SADC governments</B>. 
        <LI><B>Constraints within water management institutions</B> among which 
        are inadequacies in capacity and financial resources. </LI></UL>
      <P>The people of Southern Africa recognise that the potential &#8220;water 
      world&#8221; could be substantially improved from that which exists at present. 
      </P>
      <H4>The Vision </H4>
      <P>The people of Southern Africa therefore call for a desirable future in 
      which the norm is<B> equitable and sustainable utilisation of water for 
      social and environmental justice, regional integration and economic 
      benefit for the present and future generations. </B></P>
      <H4>Proposed actions</H4>
      <P>To achieve this Vision, the people propose national and regional 
      <B>STRATEGIC ACTIONS </B>which include the following: 
      <UL type=disc>
        <LI>The SADC Water Sector should <B>develop and implement</B> the 
        projects presented in their Regional Strategic Action Plan on Integrated 
        Water Resources Development and Management in SADC in the short to 
        medium term. Regional institutions including NGOs and consultants with 
        the necessary capacity for implementation should be identified and 
        commissioned within the next five years. 
        <LI>The people call on their national governments to <B>urgently 
        implement</B> the SADC Protocol on Shared Watercourses. 
        <LI>Governments within the Region should <B>accelerate and finalise</B> 
        their water sector legislative and institutional reforms as part of the 
        creation of an enabling environment for water sector activities in the 
        short term, including facilitating appropriate involvement of the 
        private sector. To promote a climate of collaborative participation, 
        governments should facilitate the involvement of appropriate NGOs, CBOs 
        and other stakeholders in these processes. 
        <LI>Institutions and Governments in the region should <B>facilitate the 
        development of guidelines</B> for effective public/private sector 
        participation in the water sector. 
        <LI>Institutions and Researchers in the region should <B>urgently 
        develop and publicise guidelines for the provision of water and 
        sanitation services</B> to non-traditional consumers such as peri-urban 
        informal settlements. 
        <LI>Responsible authorities and stakeholder networks in the region 
        should urgently <B>set up mechanisms </B>for the institutions and 
        consultants to <B>develop capacity building programmes</B> in IWRM for 
        water sector planners and managers. These programmes should be 
        implemented by institutions to be identified during the development of 
        the programmes in the short to medium term. 
        <LI>Leading stakeholders in the region, including stakeholder networks, 
        the media and religious leadership must <B>establish mechanisms for 
        awareness raising,</B> capacity building and empowerment of all other 
        stakeholders including women, youth and disadvantaged groups. 
        <LI>There is need to <B>develop guidelines for incorporation of IWRM 
        principles</B> in the planning, development and management of energy, 
        agriculture and other sectors that place high demands on water, be it of 
        quantity or quality. 
        <LI>These actions will call for a <B>multi-disciplinary cross-sectoral 
        effort</B> that can be led by the emerging regional water partnership 
        supported by SATAC. 
        <LI>The global community, especially cooperating partners are invited to 
        <B>complement </B>the regional effort by assisting with financial 
        resources and relevant expertise when this is not available in the 
        region. </FONT></LI></UL></TD></TR>
