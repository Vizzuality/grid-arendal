      four times in recent history, a new technology has been introduced that 
      has fundamentally transformed human society by changing the way people 
      communicate with each other. For the most part, the moment in which these 
      new technologies came into being are preserved with a kind of clarity and 
      drama that is both thrilling and unforgettable. 
      <P>There is Samuel B. Morse and the first telegram. Delivered on May 24, 
      1844, the message read "What hath god wrought!" Morse knew that he was 
      making history. 
      <P>And there was the dawn of the telephone era, heralded by Alexander 
      Graham Bell's less grand, though still legendary, summons to his assistant 
      on March 10, 1876: "Mr. Watson, come here; I want you." 
      <P>While the exact wording of Guglielmo Marconi's first wireless 
      transmission in 1895 is not the stuff of legend, it didn't take long for 
      Marconi to be heaped with honors and awards, topped off by a Nobel Prize 
      for physics in 1909. And even 30 years later the inauguration of wireless 
      service between England and South Africa felt like an historic event to 
      the participants. "We speak across time and space. . . . May the new power 
      promote peace between all nations," read the Marconigram sent from Sir 
      Edgar Walton, high commissioner of South Africa, to General J. B. M. 
      Hertzog, South Africa's prime minister, in 1924. 
      <P>Sometime in late 1971, a computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson sent the 
      first e-mail message. "I sent a number of test messages to myself from one 
      machine to the other," he recalls now. "The test messages were entirely 
      forgettable. . . . Most likely the first message was QWERTYIOP or 
      something similar." 
      <P>It seems doubtful that "QWERTYIOP" will make it into the history books. 
      And Tomlinson's name hardly lives in the public mind. When he is 
      remembered at all, it is as the man who picked @ as the locator symbol in 
      electronic addresses. In truth though, he is the inventor of e-mail, the 
      application that launched the digital information revolution. And yet the 
      breakthrough he made was such a simple evolutionary step that hardly 
      anyone noticed it till later. At the time, it barely registered with Ray 
      Tomlinson. 
      <P><B>How it Happened</B> 
      <P>Tomlinson worked for Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), the company hired 
      by the United States Defense Department in 1968 to build ARPANET, the 
      precursor to the Internet. In 1971 he was tinkering around with an 
      electronic message program called SNDMSG, which he had written to allow 
      programmers and researchers who were working on Digital PDP-10s—one of the 
      early ARPANET computers—to leave messages for each other. 
      <P>But this was not e-mail, exactly. Like a number of then existing 
      electronic message programs, the oldest dating from the early 1960s, 
      SNDMSG only worked locally; it was designed to allow the exchange of 
      messages between users who shared the same machine. Such users could 
      create a text file and deliver it to a designated "mail box." 
      <P>"A mailbox was simply a file with a particular name," Tomlinson later 
      wrote. "Its only special property was . . . [users] could write more 
      material onto the end of the mailbox, but they couldn't read or overwrite 
      what was already there." 
      <P>When Tomlinson sat down to play around with SNDMSG, he had been working 
      on an experimental file transfer protocol called CYPNET, for transferring 
      files among linked computers at remote sites within ARPANET. (At the time, 
      the ARPANET consisted of 15 nodes, located at places like UCLA in 
      California, the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and at BBN in 
      Cambridge, Massachusetts.) "The idea occurred to me that CYPNET could 
      append material to a mailbox file as readily as SNDMSG could," explained 
      Tomlinson. 
      <P>The way CYPNET was originally written, it sent and received files, but 
      had no provision for appending to a file. So he set out to adapt CYPNET to 
      use SNDMSG to deliver messages to mailboxes on remote machines, through 
      the ARPANET. 
      <P>"Adding the missing piece was a no-brainer," according to Tomlinson. 
      "Just a minor addition to the protocol." 
      <P>What Tomlinson did next, if he had fully grasped its significance, 
      might have earned him a place alongside the giants of communication 
      history. 
      <P>First, he chose the @ symbol to distinguish between messages addressed 
      to mailboxes in the local machine and messages that were headed out onto 
      the network. "The @ sign seemed to make sense," he recalled. "I used the @ 
      sign to indicate that the user was 'at' some other host rather than being 
      local." 
      <P>Then he sent himself an e-mail message. BBN had two PDP-10 computers 
      wired together through the ARPANET. "The first message was sent between 
      two machines that were literally side-by-side. The only physical 
      connection they had, however, was through the ARPANET," according to 
      Tomlinson. 
      <P>The message flew out via the network between two machines in the same 
      room in Cambridge; and the message was QWERTYIOP. Or something like that. 
      <P><B>A Natural Phenomenon</B> 
      <P>Once Tomlinson was satisfied that SNDMSG worked on the network, he sent 
      a message to colleagues letting them know about the new feature, with 
      instructions for placing an @ in between the user's login name and the 
      name of his host computer. "The first use of network mail," says 
      Tomlinson, "announced its own existence." 
      <P>Tomlinson's new program almost instantly became the first killer app. 
      "After we delivered the enhanced version of SNDMSG to other sites, (so 
      that there was someone out there to talk to) virtually all my 
      communication was via e-mail," he remembers. Two years later, a study 
      found that 75 percent of all traffic on ARPANET was e-mail. 
      <P>But if it caught on like wildfire, it somehow managed to do so almost 
      without notice. For the engineers and scientists who quickly adopted it as 
      the preferred mode of day-to-day communications, it mostly felt like a 
      logical outgrowth of the development of ARPANET. 
      <P>In fact, it took almost five years for the builders and designers of 
      ARPANET to sit back and realize that in many ways, e-mail had become the 
      real raison d'etre for the new computer network. 
      <P>"A surprising aspect of the message service is the unplanned, 
      unanticipated, and unsupported nature of its birth and early growth," 
      reads a report on e-mail written for ARPA in 1976. "It just happened, and 
      its early history has seemed more like the discovery of a natural 
      phenomenon than the deliberate development of a new technology." 
      <P>One reason that it was adopted so quickly was that it perfectly suited 
      the communications needs and style of the engineers who built ARPANET. 
      <P>In a paper published in 1978 by the Institute of Electrical and 
      Electronic Engineers, two of the important figures in the creation of the 
      ARPANET, J. C. R. Licklider and Albert Vezza, explained the popularity of 
      e-mail. "One of the advantages of the message systems over letter mail was 
      that, in an ARPANET message, one could write tersely and type imperfectly, 
      even to an older person in a superior position and even to a person one 
      did not know very well, and the recipient took no offense. . . . Among the 
      advantages of the network message services over the telephone were the 
      fact that one could proceed immediately to the point without having to 
      engage in small talk first, that the message services produced a 
      preservable record, and that the sender and receiver did not have to be 
      available at the same time." 
      <P>A report released that same year provides one of the earliest 
      indications that ARPANET developers were beginning to realize precisely 
      what they had created: "There is little doubt that the techniques of 
      network mail developed in connection with the ARPANET program are going to 
      sweep the country and drastically change the techniques used for 
      intercommunication in the public and private sectors." 
      <P><B>Tomlinson Looks Back</B> 
      <P>Tomlinson still works at BBN, which was acquired last year by GTE. A 
      principal engineer for BBN, he is currently working on a project that 
      involves "developing an architecture for quickly building distributed 
      information integration and visualization tools." In the nearly three 
      decades that have elapsed since he invented e-mail, he has worked on 
      everything from network protocols to supercomputer design. 
      <P>Recently, Tomlinson answered a few questions about his role as the 
      inventor of e-mail. The interviews were conducted, appropriately enough, 
      through e-mail. 
      <P>Asked what inspired his invention, his response comes back as 
      undramatic as the event itself: "Mostly because it seemed like a neat 
      idea," he writes. "There was no directive to 'go forth and invent 
      e-mail.'" 
      <P>Like many of the men involved in the creation of APRANET, he looks back 
      on the late 1960s and early 1970s as a golden age in both computer 
      research and their own careers. "I agree that that era was particularly 
      productive for ARPA and its contractors," he writes, "The emphasis was on 
      'advanced research' and high-risk, high-payoff projects were the norm. 
      That emphasis has eroded over time and there is less risk-taking . . . 
      things are not as exciting today." 
      <P>Finally, what of his place in history? Morse, Bell, Marconi. And 
      Tomlinson? 
      <P>"The pace [of progress] has accelerated tremendously since the [names] 
      you mention. This means that any single development is stepping on the 
      heels of the previous one and is so closely followed by the next that most 
      advances are obscured," writes the inventor of e-mail, modestly. "I think 
      that few individuals will be remembered." 
      <P>But he hasn't quite given up hope. "I am curious to find out if I am 
      wrong," he adds. <!-- ContentEnd --></FONT></P></TD>
