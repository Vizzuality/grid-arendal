                      <TD colSpan=3 vAlign=top>For hundreds of years, the 
                        mists and fogs of Britain's major cities were all too 
                        often polluted and noxious, with London especially badly 
                        affected. The fogs endangered health and also posed a 
                        threat to travellers who lost their way and thus became 
                        an easy prey to robbers. Around 1807, the smoke-laden 
                        fog of the capital came to be known as a 'London 
                        particular', i.e. a London characteristic. Charles 
                        Dickens used the term in <I>Bleak House</I> (published 
                        in 1853) and provided graphic descriptions of London's 
                        fogs in this and other novels. </TD></TR>

                        <P>The smoke-laden fog that shrouded the capital from 
                        Friday 5 December to Tuesday 9 December 1952 brought 
                        premature death to thousands and inconvenience to 
                        millions. An estimated 4,000 died because of it, 
                        excluding the cattle at Smithfield, which were, the 
                        press reported, asphyxiated. Road, rail and air 
                        transport were brought almost to a standstill and a 
                        performance at the Sadler's Wells Theatre had to be 
                        suspended when fog in the auditorium made conditions 
                        intolerable for the audience and performers.</P>
                        <P>The death toll of about 4,000 was not disputed by the 
                        medical and other authorities, but exactly how many 
                        people perished as a direct result of the fog will never 
                        be known. Many who died already suffered from chronic 
                        respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. Without the 
                        fog, they might not have died when they did. The total 
                        number of deaths in Greater London in the week ending 
                        6&nbsp;December 1952 wa<FONT color=#000000>s 2,062, 
                        which was close to normal for the time of year. The 
                        following week, the number was 4,703. The death rate 
                        peaked at 900 p</FONT>er day on the 8th and 9th and 
                        remained above average until just before Christmas. 
                        Mortality from bronchitis and pneumonia increased more 
                        than sevenfold as a result of the fog.</P>

                        <P align=left>The fog of December 1952 was by no means 
                        the first to bring death and inconvenience to the 
                        capital. On 27 December 1813, for example, fog was so 
                        dense that the Prince Regent, having set out for 
                        Hatfield House, was forced to turn back at Kentish Town. 
                        The fog persisted for almost a week and on one day was 
                        so thick that the mail coach from London to Birmingham 
                        took seven hours to reach Uxbridge. Contemporary 
                        accounts tell of the fog being so thick that the other 
                        side of the street could not be seen. They also tell of 
                        the fog bearing a distinct smell of coal tar. After a 
                        similar fog during the week of 7&#8211;13 December 1873, the 
                        death rate in the Administrative County of London 
                        increased to 40 per cent above normal. Marked increases 
                        in death rate occurred, too, after the notable fogs of 
                        January 1880, February 1882, December 1891, December 
                        1892 and November 1948. The worst affected area of 
                        London was usually the East End, where the density of 
                        factories and domestic dwellings was greater than almost 
                        anywhere else in the capital. The area was also 
                        low-lying, which inhibited fog dispersal.</P>
                        <P align=left>At the beginning of January 1900, when he 
                        reported for duty as the newly appointed Director of The 
                        Met. Office, Dr (later Sir) Napier Shaw received from 
                        the Bishop of London a 'letter of condolence', 
                        expressing sorrow that he (Shaw) should have to work in 
                        'this place of darkness', &#8212;a reference to the 
                        smoke-laden fogs of London and the fogginess of that 
                        winter in particular. One of the projects initiated by 
                        Shaw soon after he became Director was an inquiry into 
                        the occurrence and distribution of fog in the capital. 
                        The investigation confirmed that smoke from the chimneys 
                        of London served to aggravate fog problems.</P>
                        <P align=left>As long ago as the 13th century, air 
                        pollution was recognised as a public-health problem in 
                        the cities and large towns of the British Isles, and the 
                        burning of coal was identified as the principal source. 
                        Four centuries later, in his <I>Fumifugium</I>, 
                        published in 1661, John Evelyn wrote of the 'Hellish and 
                        dismall cloud of sea-coale' that lay over London and 
                        recommended that all noisome trades be banished from the 
                        city. The authorities did not, however, take his advice. 
                        The burning of coal continued and the pall of soot over 
                        London grew worse.</P>
                        <P align=left>The industrial revolution brought factory 
                        chimneys that belched gases and huge numbers of 
                        particles into the atmosphere. Some of these particles 
                        caused lung and eye irritations. Others were poisonous. 
                        All were potentially condensation nuclei, the tiny 
                        hygroscopic particles on which condensation forms. From 
                        the gases, corrosive acids were formed, notably 
                        sulphuric acid, which is produced when sulphur dioxide 
                        combines with oxygen and water.</P>
                        <P align=left>As if it were not enough that they brought 
                        on agues, rheumatism and fevers and carried particles of 
                        soot from coal fires, the fogs of the British Isles now 
                        became even more unpleasant, for the noxious emissions 
                        from factory chimneys gave them an acrid taste, an 
                        unpleasant odour and a dirty yellow or brown colour. 
                        These fogs, so different from the clean white fogs of 
                        country areas, came to be known as 'pea soupers', not 
                        only in London but also in other industrial areas of the 
                        British Isles. The particles in the atmosphere made 
                        buildings dirty and the acids attacked ironwork, 
                        stonework and fabrics.</P>
                        <P align=left>In early December 1952, the weather was 
                        cold, as it had been for some weeks. The weather of 
                        November 1952 had been considerably colder than average, 
                        with heavy falls of snow in southern England towards the 
                        end of the month. To keep warm, the people of London 
                        were burning large quantities of coal in their grates. 
                        Smoke was pouring from the chimneys of their houses and 
                        becoming trapped beneath the inversion of an anticyclone 
                        that had developed over southern parts of the British 
                        Isles during the first week of December. Trapped, too, 
                        beneath this inversion were particles and gases emitted 
                        from factory chimneys in the London area, along with 
                        pollution which the winds from the east had brought from 
                        industrial areas on the Continent.</P>

                        <P align=left>Early on 5 December in the London area, 
                        the sky was clear, winds were light and the air near the 
                        ground was moist. Accordingly, conditions were ideal for 
                        the formation of radiation fog. The sky was clear, so a 
                        net loss of long-wave radiation occurred and the ground 
                        cooled. The moist air in contact with the ground cooled 
                        to its dew-point temperature and condensation occurred. 
                        Cool air drained katabatically into the Thames Valley. 
                        Beneath the inversion of the anticyclone, the very light 
                        wind stirred the saturated air upwards to form a layer 
                        of fog 100&#8211;200 metres deep. Along with the water 
                        droplets of the fog, the atmosphere beneath the 
                        inversion contained the smoke from innumerable chimneys 
                        in the London area and farther afield. Elevated spots 
                        such as Hampstead Heath were above the fog and grime. 
                        From there, the hills of Surrey and Kent could be 
                        seen.</P>
                        <P align=left>During the day on 5 December, the fog was 
                        not especially dense and generally possessed a dry, 
                        smoky character. When nightfall came, however, the fog 
                        thickened. Visibility dropped to a few metres. The 
                        following day, the sun was too low in the sky to make 
                        much of an impression on the fog. That night and on the 
                        Sunday and Monday nights, the fog again thickened. In 
                        many parts of London, it was impossible at night for 
                        pedestrians to find their way, even in familiar 
                        districts. In the Isle of Dogs, the visibility was at 
                        times nil. The fog there was so thick that people could 
                        not see their own feet! Even in the drier thoroughfares 
                        of central London, the fog was exceptionally thick. Not 
                        until 9 December did it clear. In central London, the 
                        visibility remained belo<FONT color=#000000>w 500 
                        me</FONT>tres continuously for 114 hours and below 50 
                        metres continuously for 48 hours. At Heathrow Airport, 
                        visibility remained below ten metres for almost 48 hours 
                        from the morning of 6&nbsp;December.</P>
                        <P align=left>Huge quantities of impurities were 
                        released into the atmosphere during the period in 
                        question. On each day during the foggy period, the 
                        following amounts of pollutants were emitted: 1,000 
                        tonnes of smoke particles, 2,000 tonnes of carbon 
                        dioxide, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid and 14 tonnes 
                        of fluorine compounds. In addition, and perhaps most 
                        dangerously, 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide were 
                        converted into 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid. At London's 
                        County Hall, the concentration of smoke in the air 
                        increased from 0.49 milligrams per cubic metre on 4 
                        December to 4.46 on the 7th and 8th.</P>
                        <P align=left>The infamous fog of December 1952 has come 
                        to be known as 'The Great Smog'; the term 'smog' being a 
                        portmanteau word meaning 'fog intensified by smoke'. The 
                        term was coined almost half a century earlier, by 
                        HA&nbsp;Des&nbsp;Voeux, who first used it in 1905 to 
                        describe the conditions of fuliginous (sooty) fog that 
                        occurred all too often over British urban areas. It was 
                        popularised in 1911 when Des Voeux presented<B> </B>to 
                        the Manchester Conference of the Smoke Abatement League 
                        of Great Britain a report on the deaths that occurred in 
                        Glasgow and Edinburgh in the Autumn of 1909 as a 
                        consequence of smoke-laden fogs.</P>
                        <P align=left>Legislation followed the Great Smog of 
                        1952 in the form of the City of London (Various Powers) 
                        Act of 1954 and the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968. 
                        These Acts banned emissions of black smoke and decreed 
                        that residents of urban areas and operators of factories 
                        must convert to smokeless fuels. As these residents and 
                        operators were necessarily given time to convert, 
                        however, fogs continued to be smoky for some time after 
                        the Act of 1956 was passed. In 1962, for example, 750 
                        Londoners died as a result of a fog, but nothing on the 
                        scale of the 1952 Great Smog has ever occurred 
again.</P>
                        <P align=left>Pea-soupers have become a thing of the 
                        past, thanks partly to pollution legislation but also to 
                        slum clearance, urban renewal and the widespread use of 
                        central heating in the houses and offices of British 
                        towns and cities. As recently as the early 1960s, winter 
                        sunshine totals were thirty per cent lower in the 
                        smokier districts of London than in the rural areas 
                        around the capital. Today, there is little 
                        difference.</P>
                        <P align=left>We should not, however, be complacent. The 
                        air now contains other types of pollutants, many of them 
                        from vehicle exhausts. Among these pollutants are carbon 
                        monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, benzines and 
                        aldehydes. They are less visible than the pollutants of 
                        yesteryear but are equally toxic, causing eye 
                        irritation, asthma and bronchial complaints. To some 
                        extent, we have simply replaced one form of air 
                        pollution with another. We may question whether or not 
                        the major cities of the British Isles are any less 
                        polluted now than they have been for hundreds of 
                        years.</P></TD></TR>
