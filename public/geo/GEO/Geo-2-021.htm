            <P><FONT size=3>The WMO Global </FONT>Atmosphere Watch (GAW) system 
            was established in 1989 and has integrated a number of WMO's 
            research and monitoring activities in the field of the atmospheric 
            environment including the WMO Background Air Pollution Monitoring 
            Network (BAPMoN) and the WMO Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS), 
            established respectively in the 1960s and in the 1950s. 
            <P>The main objective of GAW is to provide data and other 
            information on the chemical composition and related physical 
            characteristics of the atmosphere and their trends, required to 
            improve understanding of the behaviour of the atmosphere and its 
            interactions with the oceans and the biosphere. The data collected 
            at the GAW monitoring stations are particularly essential to 
            understand the relationship between changing atmospheric composition 
            and changes of global and regional climate, the long-range 
            atmospheric transport and deposition of potentially harmful 
            substances over terrestrial, fresh-water and marine ecosystems, and 
            the natural cycling of chemical elements in the global 
            atmosphere/ocean/biosphere system, and anthropogenic impacts 
            thereon. 
            <P>The main long-term objectives of the WMO environmental pollution 
            monitoring and research activities incorporated in the GAW system 
            are: to provide authoritative scientific information and advice on 
            the composition and behaviour of the global atmosphere and the 
            factors that affect them; to establish and co-ordinate an 
            operational system to determine global and regional levels and 
            long-term trends of natural and man-made atmospheric constituents in 
            order to forecast future states of, and stresses on, the environment 
            and to enable governments to take prompt action to reduce pollution; 
            to further the understanding of the chemistry and physics of the 
            environment- and climate-related atmospheric constituents and 
            properties, and of the cycles of greenhouse gases in the earth 
            system, and to apply this knowledge in the fields of meteorology and 
            climatology, especially through the application of atmospheric 
            models; to promote studies of the interaction of the atmosphere with 
            the marine and terrestrial biosphere; to meet the responsibilities 
            of WMO to provide leadership and guidance in international efforts 
            directed towards the protection and management of the atmospheric 
            environment.&nbsp; The role of WMO in the GAW system is: to provide 
            a framework for participation of the WMO Members and other partners 
            in all the GAW activities; to ensure harmonization of observations 
            through preparation of manuals and guides; to further the 
            establishment and functioning in the Member countries of GAW central 
            facilities (data centres, analytical laboratories, quality 
            assurance/quality control centres, training courses, etc.); to 
            coordinate the activities of the monitoring stations and the GAW 
            central facilities; to stimulate research and preparation of 
            scientific assessments on specific environmental issues (ozone, CO2, 
            acid deposition, etc.); to promote technical cooperation, training, 
            assistance, "twinning" and transfer of technology; to maintain 
            co-operation with other relevant international and national 
            organizations and programmes; to facilitate the use of GAW products 
            by governments, scientists and other users.&nbsp; The GAW system 
            consists of global and regional monitoring stations. The global 
            stations carry out a complete range of measurements relevant to 
            climate change, atmospheric ozone changes and to other global-scale 
            environmental issues. Each global station should preferably be 
            located in a remote area where no significant changes in land-use 
            are expected for the coming decades within a reasonable distance 
            (30-50 km) in all directions. The site should be a principal 
            terrestrial biome or on an island, entirely free of the influence of 
            regional pollution sources at least 60 per cent of the time, and 
            should infrequently experience direct effects from natural phenomena 
            such as volcanic activity, forest fires and severe dust storms. 
            <P>Each station should have a complete set of surface meteorological 
            observations and be located on or near (50-70 km) an upper-air 
            synoptic station. At present there are 20 global GAW stations. 
            <P>The measurement programme for global stations includes ozone 
            (total column, vertical profile and near the surface), other 
            greenhouse gases (CO2, CFCs, CH4, N2O, water vapour), solar 
            radiation, UV, atmospheric turbidity, total aerosol load, reactive 
            gas species (SO2. NOx, CO), chemical composition of rain and 
            atmospheric particles, radionuclides and meteorological parameters. 
            To ensure the required quality of data, a number of measurement 
            manuals have been and are being prepared and a data quality 
            assurance/quality control plan for GAW has been recently developed. 
            <P>The GAW regional stations serve for assessing regional 
            environmental problems such as acid rain, increased surface ozone, 
            the deterioration of ecosystems, air pollution in rural areas, 
            airborne pollution of the seas, etc. 
            <P>Locations for GAW regional stations should be selected in such a 
            way that the observations are representative for a significant 
            portion of the region and are not unduly affected by nearby 
            pollution sources or by significant land-use changes. 
            <P>The "core" measurement programme at GAW regional stations 
            includes surface ozone, precipitation chemistry, radiation (visible 
            and UV), CH4, CO, aerosol composition, black carbon, total ozone and 
            meteorological parameters. 
            <P>Recommendations have been made concerning concrete measurement 
            programmes for fourteen geographic regions (e.g. Mediterranean and 
            Northern Africa) identified by the International Geosphere-Biosphere 
            Programme (IGBP). At present the GAW system of regional stations 
            consists of about 300 stations. 
            <P>To ensure high quality of GAW data there are three Quality 
            Assurance/Science Activity Centres - QA/SACs (in Germany for Europe 
            and Africa, in Japan for Asia and the Pacific and in the USA for the 
            Americas). There are also a number of calibration centres in 
            different host countries (for carbon dioxide, total, surface and 
            vertical ozone, precipitation chemistry, aerosol chemistry, solar 
            radiation, etc.). 
            <P>To collect, process, analyze and distribute data obtained from 
            the GAW stations, six World Data Centres have been established by 
            WMO: on ozone and UV (Toronto, Canada), other greenhouse gases 
            (Tokyo, Japan), precipitation chemistry (Albany, USA), surface ozone 
            (Kjeller, Norway), solar radiation (St Petersburg, Russia) and on 
            aerosols (Ispra, Italy). The GAW data are regularly published and 
            are available directly from the Centres upon request to all 
            organizations, scientific institutions and individual scientists. 
            <P>Scientific results made available from observations at the GAW 
            stations have been published elsewhere and are very well-known. 
            These include the scientific assessments of stratospheric ozone, the 
            documented confirmations of the decrease of ozone over Antarctica, 
            strong anticorrelation between UV-B and ozone, the increase of 
            concentrations of greenhouse gases affecting climate and of the 
            ozone-depleting substances, global acid deposition assessment, and 
            the assessment of the atmospheric inputs of trace species to the 
            World Ocean and some specific seas. These results served as a 
            scientific basis and stimulated the adoption of a number of 
            international conventions and declarations aimed at protecting the 
            atmosphere and the environment as a whole. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
