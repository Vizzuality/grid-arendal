      <H3 align=center>What citizens have done and can do to curtail corporate 
      "crime"</H3>
      <H4 align=center><I>by John S. Adams</I></H4>

      Context Institute</A> | <A 
      href="http://www.context.org/cgi-bin/store/commerce.cgi?product=IC38">To 
      order this issue ...</A></P>
      <P><BR>How do we control crime in our society? When we think of crime, we 
      usually imagine a hooded teenager vandalizing homes or assaulting someone 
      in a dark alley. Yet there's another type of wrong-doing that, while not 
      as obvious as street crime, does affect our pocketbooks, our quality of 
      life, and the lives of our children.</P>
      <P>Three of the most dramatic examples of this kind of crime include the 
      conveyance of our savings and tax dollars into failed banking 
      institutions, US corporate involvement in South Africa during apartheid, 
      and catastrophic environmental degradation, such as the oil spill from the 
      Exxon Valdez.</P>
      <P>What can we do to control or prevent serious corporate wrongdoing - 
      legal or illegal? Let's see what we can learn from these three 
      examples.</P>
      <H4>WHO'S HOLDING UP WHOM?</H4>
      <P>Taxpayers have paid $393 billion since August 1989 to rescue depositors 
      from the insolvency of 680 mismanaged banks and savings &amp; loans. Over 
      $22.9 million was returned to depositors, although most received only 
      their invested principle, not the interest.</P>
      <P>Despite brilliant management by the government's Resolution Trust 
      Corporation, which has recovered $353 billion of assets, the net cost to 
      taxpayers so far has been $40 billion, and another $18.3 billion will be 
      spent by the time the books are closed in 1996.</P>
      <P>In many states, convicted felons are now subject to the "three strikes 
      you're out" rule. Collectively, their crimes over the past five years have 
      not approached the cost to society of the savings and loan disaster. How 
      then have we dealt with this more serious crime?</P>
      <P>The debacle occurred because of highly speculative real estate lending, 
      poorly structured and counterproductive government regulation, improper 
      management of interest rate risk, and several instances of unbridled 
      greed.</P>
      <P>Prosecution has been minimal for the bank managers who participated in 
      acts of self-interest that caused insolvencies. Political exemptions, plea 
      bargaining, prison sentences reduced to community service and country club 
      jail conditions have marked the punishment of banking executives.</P>
      <P>To deter future abuses, the government has stepped up reserve 
      requirements at lending institutions and increased auditing standards.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the root problems that created the S&amp;L debacle 
      remain. While banks and savings &amp; loans currently reap record profits, 
      a steep rise in interest rates could spark another, more severe, round of 
      insolvencies. Investor monies are very fluid now and could flood out of 
      banks as they did in the early 1980s when interest rates escalated.</P>
      <P>Government regulation remains inadequate, and another round of bank 
      failures is a very real possibility. Proposals to require lenders to match 
      maturities of loans and deposits, and to require bank managers to own 
      stock in the institutions they manage have not been acted upon.</P>
      <P>We can and should demand through the legislative process improvements 
      in the banking system which strike at the root of problems in the 
      industry. As a depositor, you can protect yourself by banking at an 
      insured institution and checking to make sure that your bank is managed in 
      a manner you consider satisfactory. We will either pay for more bailouts 
      or act to prevent our victimization by corporate crime and 
      mismanagement.</P>
      <H4>SAYING "NO" TO APARTHEID</H4>
      <P>The role of multinational companies doing business in South Africa has 
      changed dramatically over the past 30 years. Initially, these corporations 
      served to support apartheid, South Africa's system of legal racial 
      discrimination.</P>
      <P>Let us look at how companies eventually helped to bring about the 
      downfall of apartheid. On March 21, 1960, international attention was 
      drawn to the practices of apartheid when unarmed black demonstrators were 
      shot near a police station at Sharpville, near Johannesburg. Foreign 
      investors partially withdrew that year, and the South African stock market 
      declined almost 50 percent. South African business executives reacted by 
      asking their government to improve conditions for blacks. This set a 
      precedent in South Africa for change in race policy through economic 
      pressure.</P>
      <P>Most Americans consider racial discrimination to be a crime. In the 
      past 30 years we have eliminated legalized segregation, brought about 
      universal voting rights, and instituted laws and practices intended to 
      equalize economic opportunity. Our experience as a nation made us 
      sensitive to the practices of apartheid in South Africa.</P>
      <P>Reverend Leon Sullivan, a southern baptist minister and contemporary of 
      Martin Luther King, while on the board of General Motors in 1976, called 
      for a code of conduct for companies doing business in South Africa. 
      Corporate adherence to these "Sullivan Principles" was an historic 
      recognition on the part of US companies that their actions were an 
      extension of the American ethic against discrimination.</P>
      <P>The religious community, municipal pensions and other corporate 
      shareholders found that their convictions could be adopted and acted upon 
      by the companies that they invested in. They were led by proxy-voting 
      initiatives sponsored by the Interfaith Center for Corporate 
      Responsibility in New York, which represents over 250 religious 
      denominations.</P>
      <P>Internal tensions in South Africa continued to mount as the 
      then-illegal African National Congress and other organizations kept up the 
      pressure for an end to apartheid. When Bishop Desmond Tutu called for an 
      international boycott of South Africa in 1981, a disgusted international 
      community was eager to answer the call for action. Numerous multinational 
      corporations withdrew. Banks curbed lending, and, in 1985, withdrew 
      extension of further credit to South Africa. These acts culminated in the 
      US mandating economic sanctions against South Africa in 1986.</P>
      <P>Slowly the South African government started to react. The onerous 
      "pass" laws were rescinded in 1986, allowing greater freedom for blacks to 
      work and travel. Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the year 
      the ANC regained legal status. During this period more private investors, 
      religious groups, municipal funds, and pensions "screened" their 
      investments to eliminate companies doing business in South Africa. By 
      September of 1993, over $800 billion - fully 10 percent of stock 
      investment in the US - was screened in this way. This was unprecedented in 
      the history of the US stock market.</P>
      <P>In 1992 and 1993, the South African government agreed to most of the 
      ANC's demands. By August of 1993, a new constitution had been drafted in 
      South Africa, and on August 24, 1993, at a meeting of the UN General 
      Assembly, Nelson Mandela called for the lifting of all economic sanctions. 
      The country's first all-race elections were held April 26-29, 1994. Nelson 
      Mandela, who was released from jail just four years ago, was inaugurated 
      president of South Africa on May 10.</P>
      <P>The lion's share of the credit for this transformation belongs to the 
      people of South Africa. Nevertheless, they were significantly assisted by 
      religious, student, and social investor groups who convinced banks, 
      multinational corporations, pension funds, and local governments to 
      withdraw their investment from South Africa. In so doing, they proved that 
      the socially responsible direction of capital is a powerful tool for 
      affecting corporate behavior, which in turn has enormous influence 
      throughout the world.</P>
      <H4>A COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT</H4>
      <P>When the Exxon Valdez split open and began dumping 11 million barrels 
      of crude oil into Prince William Sound, most of us felt personally 
      violated. The reaction in the US included intense media coverage, enormous 
      volunteer clean-up efforts, and an immediate consumer backlash as more 
      than 40,000 Exxon gas card-holders cut up their cards and returned them. 
      Many more Americans refused to buy gas at an Exxon pump.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the disaster, a group of religious leaders, investors, 
      and environmentalists created a code of environmental conduct for 
      companies. The code, initially named the "Valdez Principles," was 
      patterned after the Sullivan Principles used in South Africa. Now called 
      the CERES Principles (named for the Coalition for Environmentally 
      Responsible Economies), they include commitments to protect the biosphere, 
      to use resources sustainably, to reduce waste and conserve energy, and to 
      keep the public informed about environmental performance.</P>
      <P>Social investors have put intense pressure on companies to adopt the 
      CERES Principles and have met with extraordinary success. Over 80 US 
      companies have signed on, ranging from former fighters of environmental 
      standards, such as Sun Oil Co., to companies with excellent environmental 
      records, like Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and H.B. Fuller. The largest 
      industrial company in the world, General Motors, signed the principles in 
      January 1994.</P>
      <P>To meet the standards of the CERES Principles and the test of public 
      scrutiny, many companies will have to fundamentally restructure their 
      operations. This change in approach has already begun. Instead of fighting 
      regulators and environmental groups and using end-of-the-pipeline 
      solutions, such as pollution cleanup and litigation, many companies are 
      hiring environmental engineers to design pollution elimination processes. 
      The cost savings that result from this preventative approach has surprised 
      many corporate executives who have also noticed its public relations 
      value.</P>
      <P>While signing the CERES Principles does not guarantee that a company 
      will place the interests of society and the environment first, it does 
      indicate a willingness to recognize these overriding concerns. The 
      escalating rate of adoption of the principles shows that corporations can 
      be affected by the values of the culture in which they are based.</P>
      <H4>MAKING A DIFFERENCE</H4>
      <P>In the past 30 years, a dramatic shift in ownership has taken place in 
      corporations. Pension plans now own the largest percentage of shares of 
      corporate stock. Collectively, we who are small investors own corporate 
      America through pensions, mutual funds, and other investments. We are 
      entitled to vote proxy motions in stock we own.</P>
      <P>We can also influence corporations by supporting appropriate regulation 
      and boycotting companies that act irresponsibly. We exert our influence 
      whenever we extend or withhold our patronage, particularly when we inform 
      a company of our reasons for taking action.</P>
      <P>It could be useful, then, to consider that corporate crime is our 
      crime. Our crime is committed not by intent but by omission when we ignore 
      the behavior of the companies with which we do business and which we 
      capitalize.</P>
      <P>Despite the legal language that treats them as people, corporations are 
      not alive. They have only the rights we have chosen to grant them. We have 
      created a large and effective economic engine, comparable to a D-6 
      bulldozer, which can either carve careful clearings in a park or run over 
      anything in its path. Clearly this bulldozer should not run at full 
      throttle with no one at the controls. Perhaps together we can guide this 
      engine of industry carefully. We can start by voting our convictions, and 
      investing and making our purchases intentionally.</P>
