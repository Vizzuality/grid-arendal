    <TD width="69%"><FONT face=Arial><BR>Images of grief and destruction from 
      torrential rains in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela) last 
      December have been replaced by today's equaling gripping coverage of 
      Cyclone Eline in Mozambique. But the tragedy continues long after the news 
      coverage fades. As Venezuela starts to recover and rebuild, and with the 
      rainy season looming close by, the World Bank is urging the government to 
      take steps now to protect the economy and the poor.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
      face=Arial>Two weeks of heavy rain on December 15, 1999, resulted in flash 
      floods, laden with soil, vegetation, and debris, hurling down the Avila 
      mountain range to the coast. Areas where dense and informal urban 
      settlements had sprung up over the years were swept under and destroyed. 
      Walls of mud and rock, reaching almost 30 feet, smashed into the Vargas 
      area north of Caracas, leaving behind a scene of destruction that mixed 
      images of floods, earthquakes, and landslides.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
      face=Arial>The damage is estimated at $3.2 billion, or 3.3 percent of the 
      country's GDP. Property and major infrastructure&#8212;such as dams, bridges, 
      transport and electricity services&#8212;make up about 60 percent of the direct 
      damage. The grimmest effect was the toll on human life, with at least 
      20,000 lives claimed. Because the disaster occurred at night, many more 
      families may have disappeared than known. It was the country's worst 
      disaster in 50 years.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>The government 
      responded swiftly, rescuing and evacuating some 120,000 people. About 
      200,000 people are still living in temporary shelters or with relatives, 
      receiving assistance from local authorities, NGOs, relief agencies, and 
      the military. Another 200,000 people are still without access to safe 
      water in the state of Miranda. The huge task of clearing debris is 
      ongoing, river channels are being cleaned, and the authorities are 
      providing basic infrastructure and social services in affected 
      areas.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>"We can help Venezuela recover from 
      this terrible human tragedy," says World Bank Country Director Andres 
      Solimano, "and put in place the policies and mechanisms to ensure that 
      whatever the vagaries of nature, their effect will not be so 
      devastating."</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>"We are hoping to redirect 
      existing operations swiftly to re-establish basic services," says Danny 
      Leipziger, who heads the Finance, Private Sector Development and 
      Infrastructure Department in the Latin America and Caribbean Region, 
      "while at the same time working with the government to prevent future 
      tragedies through better land-use."</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
      face=Arial>Solimano and Leipziger's team several weeks ago presented to 
      the World Bank's Board of Directors a proposal to do just that. It comes 
      as the Bank in early February launched the Provention Consortium, a 
      coalition of international partners that, among other things, will focus 
      on building capacity in low-income countries to anticipate and prepare for 
      catastrophes. (</FONT><A

      related story.) </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>"Venezuela does not have 
      the institutions in place to do this," says Arnaud Guinard, Coordinator of 
      Disaster Management in the Bank's Latin America and Caribbean region. 
      Guinard, in his presentation to the Board, said that Venezuela cannot 
      afford any delays in setting up an effective response system. His proposal 
      would help Venezuela build its capacity for mapping out risk-prone and 
      vulnerable areas, and strengthen its disaster management system. Under the 
      proposal, the Bank would also help Venezuela with dam safety, urban 
      land-use planning, and regulations, and would provide financing to restore 
      water services and for environmental management.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
      face=Arial>After the flood, the Bank's first emergency team arrived in 
      Venezuela as soon as airports reopened in early January and began the 
      process of prioritizing and strategic planning, providing policy advice 
      which the country has now embraced, and restructuring loans to provide 
      assistance. The Bank is now preparing plans for possible additional 
      emergency financial support. Meanwhile, the International Finance 
      Corporation, the private sector arm of the Bank, in January approved a $30 
      million supplementary loan to help restore 
      electricity.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>"We need political commitment 
      at the highest level," says Solimano, "and working with the government and 
      the international community, we can help put in place the institutions 
      needed to ensure that preventable deaths are prevented in the 
      future."</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>Helpful links: For more on the
