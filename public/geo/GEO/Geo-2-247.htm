<P><SPAN style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">Vancouver</SPAN> – </B>Sockeye stocks 
from the Upper Adams River near Chase and the Nadina River south of Burns Lake 
experienced record escapement levels, the highest escapement in decades, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada announced today.</P>
<P>This year, escapement surveys indicate that nearly 70,000 sockeye returned to 
the Upper Adams River to spawn. This is a miraculous recovery as the Upper Adams 
River early summer sockeye run, historically among the largest in the Fraser 
River, was driven to extinction in the early part of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
century. The combined effects of the Hell's Gate slide and local logging 
practices, such as a splash dam operated at a local mill on Adams Lake, 
devastated the stocks from the period 1913 until 1953.</P>
<P align=justify>By the 1980s, significant improvements to these salmon stocks 
began to show in the area. In 1992, 2,990 sockeye returned to spawn, and in 
1996, approximately 25,000 sockeye returned. The improvements are the result of 
ongoing rebuilding efforts that began in 1949 with the transplanting and 
hatchery augmentation work begun by the decommissioned International Pacific 
Salmon Fisheries Commission. These efforts were continued and improved upon by 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) in conjunction 
with local First Nations.</P>
<P align=justify>In the Nadina River, more than 194,000 sockeye returned to 
spawn this year. Like the Upper Adams, the Nadina run suffered from the combined 
effects of the Hell’s Gate slide and deleterious logging practices such as log 
drives in the lower river. Poor escapements in the 1940s through to the 1960s 
prompted Fisheries and Oceans to construct a spawning channel in 1970, intended 
to augment the natural production of this stock. Escapement increased to several 
thousand in the 1980s, and in 1996 to nearly 40,000 sockeye.</P>
<P>In both of these areas, stock rebuilding success has been the result of many 
decades of dedicated enhancement, combined with a precautionary management 
approach that sets harvest rates at a level that permits the spawners to return 
to their natal areas.</P>
<P>Fisheries and Oceans Canada has placed a high priority on restoring these 
stocks and with the joint efforts of First Nations and other stakeholders, 
restoration efforts appear to be successful.</P><B>
