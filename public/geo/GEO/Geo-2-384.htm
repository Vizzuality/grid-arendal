      <BR>Brief: The purpose of the Arctic Offshore Oil and Gas Guidelines is to 
      set forth the specific operational steps which should be followed when 
      planning for Arctic offshore oil and gas activities. EPPR prepared the 
      guidelines on emerging response at the request of PAME, the overall

      programmatic successes and lessons that have been learned in Arctic

      future work that might be taken up by the Arctic Council.

      <BR>Arctic Council Participation: N/A <BR>Implementing Agency: N/A 
      <BR>Brief: The goal of this project is to provide Sami with a broad 
      picture of the current status of the affairs and to identify steps to be 
      taken to increase Sami involvement in the management of fisheries. In 
      addition, a representative steering committee for sustainable freshwater 
      fisheries in the Barents Region would be established which would have Sami 
      representation. The Sami Council has identified four issues regarding the 
      Sami freshwater fishery for study: historical; socio-economic; 
      co-management models; and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). To 
      address these four issues, the Sami Council proposed a two-year 
      multidisciplinary program whereby the current management regimes for 
      freshwater fisheries across the Barents Region are analyzed in the light 
      of their impact on Sami.

      Participation: N/A <BR>Implementing Agency: N/A <BR>The goal of the 
      project is to identify how best to incorporate Sami Traditional Ecological 
      Knowledge into managing coastal fish resources and what institutional 
      steps need to be taken in order to ensure Sami representation. Fishery 
      management arrangements in three fjords in Northern Norway will be taken 
      as an example. Lyngen, Tana and Tysfjord, and their arrangements will be 
      compared to selected coastal fisheries in the Kola Peninsula, northern 
      Canada, Greenland and Alaska. Levels of co-management in all fisheries 
      will be examined and their applicability to the Sami coastal fishery will 
      be ascertained. The project will also document the extent of Sea Sami 
      knowledge and involvement in the coastal and fjord fisheries of the 
      regions they inhabit. Most importantly, the project will best illuminate 
      what institutional arrangements need to be made in order to incorporate 
      Sami knowledge and skill into the coastal fishery management regime.

      Arctic cultural resources in partnership with Native and Other residents. 
      On an international level, the DCED convened a small group of officials 
      and rural business owners, concerned with development and marketing of 
      cultural and eco-tourism and traditional arts and crafts in the eight 
      Arctic nations. Alaska created a central website for Alaska cultural 
      resources and eco-tourism destinations and document its success. Alaska's 
      experience with the website will be shared with the other Arctic nations.

      Greenland <BR>The goal of this project is to develop new indicators of 
      living conditions for Sami and Inuit communities in the Arctic. The new 
      research design and the indicators are to reflect the specific economic 
      and cultural characteristics of the indigenous peoples and include a 
      statistical method for sampling in the Arctic. The Inuit and Saami 
      populations in Inuvialuit, Nunavut, Nunavik, Labrador, Greenland, Alaska, 
      Chukotka, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Kola Peninsula share a number of 
      economic, cultural and technological concerns in common. Current measures 
      show higher unemployment, lower income levels, poorer health and more 
      social problems among Inuit and Saami than among the rest of the 
      population in these countries. As a result, it is important, from the 
      perspective of policy planning as well as research, to be able to 
      accurately document the present level and any future changes of the 
      conditions of life in these areas.

      and access to health care. The reporting systems on health status in a 
      number of Arctic countries do not provide sufficient relevant information 
      on indigenous peoples. The situation in Russia, taking into account the 
      current economic situation in this country, is of special concern. <A

      will be interactive, meaning that concrete environmental projects will be 
      developed by the participants and implemented in all participating 
      production units and public utilities as part of the training programme. A 
      system for creating further continual improvements (EMS), based on the 
      acquired capacity within the company will be established.</P><FONT
