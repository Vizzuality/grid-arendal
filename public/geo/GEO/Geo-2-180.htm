<P><B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>Desertification is a land degradation problem of major importance in the arid 
regions of the world. Deterioration in soil and plant cover have adversely 
affected nearly 50 percent of the land areas as the result of human 
mismanagement of cultivated and range lands. North America and Spain have the 
largest percentage of their arid lands affected. Overgrazing and woodcutting are 
responsible for most of the desertification of rangelands, cultivation practices 
inducing accelerated water and wind erosion are most responsible in the rain-fed 
croplands, and improper water management leading to salinization is the cause of 
the deterioration of irrigated lands. In addition to vegetation deterioration, 
erosion, and salinization, desertification effects can be seen in loss of soil 
fertility, soil compaction, and soil crusting. Urbanization, mining, and 
recreation are having adverse effects on the land of the same kind as is seen on 
range, dry farming, and irrigated lands. Combating desertification can be done 
successfully using techniques already known if financial resources are available 
and the political will to act is present.

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>Desertification of the arid lands of the world has been proceeding--sometimes 
rapidly, sometimes slowly--for more than a thousand years. It has caused untold 
misery among those most directly affected, yet environmental destruction 
continues. Until recently, few if any lessons seemed to have been learned from 
the past, in part because the problem was an insidious one that went 
unrecognized in its early stages or was seen as a local one affecting only a 
small population, and in part because new land was always available to start 
over again. As long as remedial action could be deferred by moving on to new 
frontiers, land conservation had little appeal. It was not until the 20th 
century--when easy land expansion came to an end--that governments and people 
finally realized that continued careless degradation of natural resources 
threatened their future.
<P><B>INTERNATIONAL DIRECTIONS</B>
<P>The decade of the 1950's witnessed the first worldwide effort to call 
attention to the problems and potentials of arid regions. It started when the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
launched its Major Project on Scientific Research on Arid Lands in 1951. That 
project led to publication of a newsletter, the provision for funds for 
establishing and strengthening arid land research institutes, organization of 
conferences and symposia, and publication of a series of research reviews and 
special reports on a wide range of topics. The Major Project was terminated in 
1962 and the arid land program was merged with the broader UNESCO natural 
resource program.
<P>The impetus generated by the UNESCO project led to expanded interest in, and 
support of, arid lands studies throughout the world. By 1970, knowledgeable 
scientists were well aware of the magnitude of the land destruction that had 
taken place in the past, and that was becoming even more serious as population 
pressures increased.
<P>At about the same time, one event served to focus world attention on 
desertification: the 1969 to 1973 drought in the African Sahel. Recognition of 
the severity of the drought affecting six countries on the southern border of 
the Sahara (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta, Niger, and Chad) was slow to 
develop. Droughts, after all, were not unusual in the Sahelian countries; an 
equally bad or even worse one had struck the same region during the years from 
1911 to 1914, and several other droughts had occurred before and after that 
time. It was only when the situation had become catastrophic that relief 
measures were undertaken on a large scale. Among the aftereffects of the human 
toll and the millions of livestock that died due to the drought, was the call by 
the United Nations General Assembly for the convening of an International 
Conference on Desertification. The conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 
August and September of 1977, attended by representatives of nearly 100 nations 
and many international organizations; governmental and nongovernmental. In 
addition to providing a forum by which the world's attention was drawn to the 
land destruction that was occurring, the conference addressed the problem of 
combating desertification of arid lands. A plan of action was drawn to the land 
destruction that was developed and approved by the delegates (United Nations, 
1978). Responsibility for following up and coordinating the implementation of 
the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification was entrusted to the United Nations 
Environment Program.
<P><B>DEFINITION</B>
<P>Desertification is a term that has been in use since at least 1949 when 
Aubreville, a perceptive and well-informed botanist and ecologist, published a 
book on "Climate, Forets, et Desertification de l'Afrique Tropicale" 
(Aubreville, 1949). Aubreville thought of desertification as the changing of 
productive land into a desert as the result of ruination of land by man-induced 
soil erosion. He associated it with the humid and subhumid tropics where he 
worked. The causes of land destruction were tree cutting, indiscriminate use of 
fire, and cultivation, which exposed the soil to water and wind erosion. 
Desertification was not the result of the Sahara spreading outward but of 
localized activity that could begin anywhere. Aubreville was quite clear in his 
conclusion that desertification in tropical Africa was due to man's activity, 
and that there had been no significant climatic change during the past thousand 
or more years. Most of that destructive activity has occurred within recent 
historic time by the action of agricultural populations.
<P>Despite the fact that a world conference has been held on the subject, there 
is no generally accepted definition of desertification. For most people, the 
word probably evokes a mental picture of a barren forbidding landscape 
resembling Death Valley or the Sahara. Fortunately, that grim picture does not 
apply to most of the land that has undergone desertification.
<P>A definition of desertification should recognize that it is a land 
degradation process that involves a continuum of change, from slight to very 
severe degradation of the plant and soil resource, and is due to man's 
activities. The definition used here is the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Desertification is the impoverishment of terrestrial ecosystems 
  under the impact of man. It is the process of deterioration in these 
  ecosystems that can be measured by reduced productivity of desirable plants, 
  undesirable alterations in the biomass and the diversity of the micro and 
  macro fauna and flora, accelerated soil deterioration, and increased hazards 
  for human occupancy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig1.gif">Figure 1</A> delimits 
the arid regions with which this monograph is concerned. The map is redrawn from 
a UNESCO map of the arid regions (UNESCO, 1977).
<P><B>DESERT SPREAD AND DROUGHTS</B>
<P>A common misapprehension about desertification is that it spreads from a 
desert core, like a ripple on a pond. The truth is that land degradation can and 
does occur far from any climatic desert; the presence or absence of a nearby 
desert has no direct relation to desertification. Desertification usually begins 
as a spot on the land-scape where land abuse has become excessive. From that 
spot, which might be around a watering point or in a cultivated field, land 
degradation spreads outward if the abuse continues. Ultimately the spots may 
merge into a homogeneous area, but that is unusual on a large scale.
<P>A second misconception is that droughts are responsible for desertification. 
Droughts do increase the likelihood that the rate of degradation will increase 
on non-irrigated land if the carrying capacity is exceeded. However, 
well-managed land will recover from droughts with minimal adverse effects when 
the rains return. The deadly combination is land abuse during good periods and 
its continuation during periods of deficient rainfall. The famous satellite 
photograph taken during the 1970's drought of a green rectangle (the Ekrafane 
Ranch) surrounded by brown denuded land in eastern Niger demonstrated 
dramatically the value of good range management during favorable and unfavorable 
years.
<P><B>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</B>
<P>Land degradation is by no means a new problem, despite the attention focused 
upon it in recent years. In some quarters, there is a tendency to blame 
desertification upon land pressures generated by the population explosion of the 
middle 20th century. While the rapidly expanding population has greatly 
exacerbated the situation, desertification is not a new phenomenon.
<P>Historical evidence shows that serious and extensive land deterioration 
occurring several centuries ago in the arid regions had three epicenters: the 
Mediterranean Sea, The Mesopotamian Valley, and the loessial plateau of China. 
There were other places where destructive changes in soil and plant cover had 
occurred but they were small in extent or are not well known.
<P><B><U>Last One Hundred Years</U></B>
<P>Desertification in Africa and elsewhere began long before the 1969-1973 
drought struck the Sahel. Stebbing (1937a, 1937b) was the most persistent of 
those sounding the alarm over the rapid deforestation of the Sahelian and 
Sudanian vegetative zones. He looked upon desertification in West Africa as 
forest degradation that leads to erosion and, as a last stage, to barren sand or 
rock. That process is hastened, he contended, by blown sand from the Sahara 
being deposited on the deforested land. It was this latter activity that led him 
to refer to the "encroaching Sahara," a term he later regretted using (Stebbing, 
1938). He disclaimed any attempt to give the idea that the Sahara was a vast 
sand field advancing in great waves like the incoming tide of a sea. The latter 
concept, however, has proved so attractive to numerous writers on 
desertification that it now represents a common view on the subject 
(Cloudsley-Thompson, 1974). There apparently is something fascinating about the 
idea of an expanding desert threatening mankind. Encroachment of moving sand 
dunes on desert oases and transportation routes is an aspect of desertification 
that is of small areal extent but is locally important and highly visible.
<P>Warnings similar to those of Stebbing for the Sahel were made by other 
scientists in southern Africa, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia 
during the 1920's and 1930's. Research has been undertaken in many countries to 
develop techniques of grazing management and soil and water conservation that 
would halt and reverse desertification. As a result, there is now a good 
understanding of the basic principles of land conservation. Field application of 
those principles has been slow, unfortunately, and land degradation continues to 
undermine efforts to improve human well-being.
<P><B>OCCURRENCE OF DESERTIFICATION</B>
<P>Desertification affects nearly all of the arid regions, to varying degrees, 
except for the extremely arid climatic deserts such as the Sahara, Atacama, and 
Taklimakan. An indication of the extent and intensity of the desertification 
that has occurred in the past is presented in <A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig2.gif">Figures 2</A><I><A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig3.gif">3</I></A>, <I><A

href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig7.gif">7</A>.
<P>The classification system used in the preparation of continental 
desertification maps is based on four classes of desertification: slight, 
moderate, severe, and very severe. The criteria for each class are as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Slight: Little or no degradation of the soil and plant cover has 
  occurred.
  <P>Moderate: (1) 26 to 50 percent of plant community consists of climax 
  species, or (2) 25 to 75 percent of original topsoil lost, or (3) soil 
  salinity has reduced crop yields 10 to 50 percent.
  <P>Severe: (1) 10 to 25 percent of plan community consists of climax species, 
  or (2) erosion has removed all or practically all of the topsoil, or (3) 
  salinity controllable by drainage and leaching has reduced crop yield by more 
  than 50 percent.
  <P>Very Severe: (1) Less than 10 percent of plant community consists of climax 
  species, or (2) land has many sand dunes or deep gullies, or (3) salt crusts 
  have developed on very slow permeable irrigated soils.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "very severe" category represents the extreme condition that many people 
associate with desertification. It is land so badly degraded that its utility by 
man or animals is virtually zero and the degradation is economically 
irreversible, for most purposes. While there are many small areas of land that 
fit into this category, there are few areas large enough to be shown on the 
continental maps. Practically all of the world's desertification can, at this 
point, be reversed.
<P>Delineations on the maps, because of the small scale employed, usually are 
combinations of different desertification classes, for example, and area shown 
as moderately desertified may have inclusions of slightly desertified and 
severely desertified land. The guidelines established to determine the map 
classification for any delineated area are given in <A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab1.gif">Table 1</A>. <A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab2.gif">Table 2</A> gives data on the 
land area of the arid regions of the world in the four desertification classes. 
Most of the land used for agriculture in the arid regions is at least moderately 
desertified. The 52.1-percent figure for land in the category of slight 
desertification consists mainly of the naturally barren climatic deserts 
(hyperarid regions) where man's presence has been minimal.
<P><B>AFRICA</B>
<P>The severe Sahelian drought that extended from through l969 focused the 
world's attention on the human aspects of land degradation and led to the 
convening of the 1977 United Nations Conference on Desertification. Drought, 
however, is not the cause of desertification; man is. The drought served only to 
place additional stress on the biological resources of the Sahel. If resource 
management has been good, little, if any, permanent damage is done by droughts. 
However, if resource management has been unwise, a drought accentuates the 
adverse impact of that management and accelerates land degradation (Weaver and 
Albertson, 1940). The latter is what has occurred widely in the Sahel and 
elsewhere.
<P>All of the usual forms of desertification are present in the arid regions of 
the African continent and are manifested as serious local or regional problems 
(<A href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig2.gif">Figure 2</A>). 
Overgrazing has reduced range productivity virtually everywhere outside the 
tsetse fly regions, in north, west, east, and south Africa. Wind and water 
erosion have devastated landscapes in the cultivated regions and in much of the 
rangelands (Rapp, 1974). Shortened fallow periods in the shifting cultivation 
system south of the Sahara have led to severe depletion of plant nutrients. 
Salinization and waterlogging of irrigated land is worst in the Nile Valley and 
North Africa but also occurs elsewhere. Mining has left surface scars wherever 
it is practiced. The environmental degradation continues and shows no sign of 
slowing down.
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>A number of factors have increased land degradation and the vulnerability of 
the African arid regions to desertification. Most of them have had similar 
effects in Asia and Latin America. They can be grouped in three categories: (1) 
increased human and animal population, (2) improved health services, and (3) 
injudicious use of technology.
<P>Due to the increased sedentary population, pressures on cultivated land led 
to a shortening of the fallow period in the shifting cultivation cycle and the 
extension of cropping into the more precarious drier regions. Crop harvests 
became less reliable and more variable as the desert edge was approached. 
Concurrently, nomadic pastoralists were deprived of some of their best grazing 
lands as the cultivators moved in (Delwaulle, 1977). At the same time the 
rangeland area was contracting, populations of pastoralists and their livestock 
were increasing and the provision of improved veterinary services and the lack 
of a viable marketing system helped assure that animal numbers would grow 
rapidly (Widstrand, 1975). The result was inevitable: overgrazing and 
accelerated desertification.
<P>Overgrazing inadvertently was made worse, particularly in the Sahel, by the 
drilling of additional wells that provided drinking water for livestock 
throughout the year. Without the rest period that intermittent water supplies 
previously assured, forage conditions deteriorated around the wells where water 
was no longer a limiting factor in livestock survival. Local authorities did not 
or could not impose a control system that would allow forage plants to recover 
from heavy grazing.
<P>A crude estimate of the amount of crop yield reduction that could be 
attributed to salinization and waterlogging in the Nile Valley indicates it to 
be at least 17 percent on 80 to 90 percent of the old irrigated land. In the 
newly irrigated lands east and west of the delta, the figure is likely to be a 
minimum of 25 percent yield reduction. Both problems are serious ones that can 
become even more serious in the future if remedial measures are not taken. The 
situation in Algeria and Tunisia is similar to that in Egypt with respect to 
yield reductions.
<P>Solutions to desertification problems in Africa are known-- and in 
general--can be implemented readily if resources are available to do so. An 
exploding population in the developing countries, however, means that land 
pressures will continue to build. Reducing livestock numbers in the grazing 
lands until forage productivity can be improved is very difficult, at best, and 
introducing range use controls on communal land is not easy. There is little 
likelihood that marginal dryfarm lands will be returned to pastoral use unless 
production on the better lands is increased enough to offset the loss of 
cultivated land. While the latter can be done, progress in that direction is 
very slow.
<P>Destruction of woody vegetation has been hastened by the ever-increasing need 
for firewood to meet the demands of the larger population. The destruction is 
especially noticeable around the rapidly growing urban centers, where the circle 
of deforested lands gets larger every year (Delwaulle, 1973).
<P>While desertification was a long-standing problem even in the absence of 
droughts, the gradually increasing vulnerability of the land made the impact of 
the inevitable droughts worse than ever (Dahl and Hjort, 1979). The factors 
responsible for that vulnerability are still operating, desertification 
continues, and future droughts will have ever-greater damaging effects.
<P>Salt-affected soils are common in Tunisia and Algeria where both surface and 
well irrigation waters frequently are saline. Salinization is important in other 
irrigated areas but on a small scale.
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>About 18 percent of the arid region of Africa is severely desertified, and 
most of that represented by grazing lands and rain-fed cropping lands on the 
south side of the Sahara (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab3.gif">Table 3</A>). The other large 
area that is severely affected is the mountain slopes and the plains of North 
Africa. Moderate to high salinity affects about 30 percent of the irrigated land 
in Egypt (Aboukhaled et al., 1975).
<P>Wind erosion is dominant in the drier regions and water erosion on the wetter 
sloping lands. Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Morocco, 
and Tunisia have been subjected to especially serious water erosion, whereas 
wind erosion has been most damaging in sub-Saharan West Africa. While good data 
on the effect of land degradation on crop and livestock yields are not 
available, it seems likely that soil fertility losses, alone, have reduced 
dryland crop yields by 25 to 50 percent in the severely desertified areas. 
Animal productivity may well have declined by at least 50 percent nearly 
everywhere that domestic livestock are raised. In many areas south of the 
Sahara, rangeland forage production probably is less than 25 percent of the 
potential.
<P><B>ASIA</B>
<P>Desertification in the arid regions of Asia is characterized by overgrazing 
of the rangelands of the Middle East and Central Asia, water erosion of 
cultivated lands from eastern China to the Mediterranean Sea, and salinization 
and waterlogging on a large scale in Iraq, Pakistan, China, and the Soviet 
Union. Mining (including oil and gas production) has caused severe land damage 
wherever it is carried on.
<P>Overgrazing, soil erosion, and salt damage to irrigated land are 
long-standing problems in the Middle East and Central Asia, as is water erosion 
on the rain-fed cultivated lands of India, Pakistan, and the loessial plateau of 
China. Waterlogging and salinization are problems centuries old in the lower 
plain of the Yellow River in China, but are of relatively recent origin in the 
Indus Basin of Pakistan and India. Ameliorative measures to reduce land 
degradation have been undertaken in every country affected, with varying degrees 
of success. The problem is an immense one in terms of the area involved and the 
amount of degradation that has occurred (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig3.gif">Figure 3</A>).
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>Man first placed his imprint on the landscapes of Asia thousands of years 
ago. Historical records make it clear that the destructive impact of man was 
already apparent two or three thousand years ago in China and the Middle East. 
It was then that the first period of accelerated, man-made erosion began 
(Dregne, in press). Woodcutting and cultivation of sloping lands were 
responsible for most of the land degradation that occurred in the uplands of 
China and around the Fertile Crescent. Sedimentation of canals, waterlogging, 
and salinization combined to raise havoc in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys of 
Mesopotamia (Jacobsen and Adams, 1958).
<P>Grazing pressure seems to have become a much greater problem in the past two 
or three decades than it was before. There has been an explosion of human and 
livestock population recently from India (Office of Environmental Planning and 
Coordination, 1977) to the Middle East (Pearse, 1971). Cultivation has been 
extended into pastoral lands, wells have been constructed to make pastures 
usable throughout the year, and improved transportation facilities have made 
formerly remote areas accessible to livestock. As a consequence, cropping has 
become a high-risk land use in the climatically marginal areas that formerly 
were the best grazing lands. At the same time, overgrazing of the remaining 
range lands is accelerated by the increased concentration of livestock on drier 
lands. Destruction of vegetative cover on sandy lands has led to widespread wind 
erosion, depletion of soil fertility, and the undertaking of expensive erosion 
control projects in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere.
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>Asia has large areas where desertification is so severe that it borders on 
being classed as very severe desertification, but about half of the land is only 
slightly desertified (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab4.gif">Table 4</A>). Water erosion 
is spectacular in the loessial plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow 
River. The eroded silt is sometimes so thick in the river that at Shanhsien, 
east of Xian, the sediment load has been measured at 46 percent. The river 
annually carries 1.3 billion tons of sediment, enough to cover 1,800 square 
kilometers of land 30 centimeters deep (de Crespigny, 1971). Virtually all of 
that represents loess eroded from 300,000 square kilometers of highlands. 
Efforts are being made to reduce erosion but the problem is so huge that 
progress is slow. Only the great thickness of the aeolian deposits has allowed 
cultivation to be continued on the eroding slopes.
<P>Water erosion also approaches the spectacular on the slopes of the dryland 
farming areas of western India and northern Pakistan. Fortunately, the soils 
there are more resistant to displacement than in loessial material. 
Nevertheless, the damage--in the form of reduced yields--is serious nearly 
everywhere, and it is getting worse.
<P>Salinization and waterlogging are as bad--and as difficult to control--in the 
irrigated region of southern Iraq as they are anywhere in the world. Deep 
fine-textured soils and almost flat topography make it hard to provide drainage 
that is adequate to maintain a deep water table and prevent salt accumulation. 
Techniques of soil and water management that are suitable for conditions in Iraq 
have been developed and tested successfully, but the technical problems are less 
difficult to resolve than the social ones (Dougrameji and Clor, 1977). Land 
reclamation is much easier on the more permeable soils of the Indus Valley and 
Central Asia.
<P>Range productivity over most of the Middle East and western Pakistan is among 
the lowest in the arid world. A small beginning has been made in bringing the 
pastoral lands up to their potential productivity. Much remains to be done, 
however, because range management is only a young science in Asia. Recent 
emphasis on sand dune stabilization has led to a number of successful efforts to 
find effective methods and to identify adapted plants. Accomplishments have been 
outstanding, under very difficult circumstances.
<P>A rapidly growing population and limited land resources mean that combating 
desertification will be difficult for the developing nations of Asia and very 
difficult for the poor countries. Land pressures must somehow be relieved, and 
that can only be accomplished by raising productivity and yields per unit area. 
A start can be made with presently available knowledge, but research and 
training will be needed to broaden the knowledge base and to provide guidance to 
the pastoralists and cultivators.
<P><B>AUSTRALIA</B>
<P>Land degradation in Australia is, from the standpoint of area affected, a 
problem of overgrazing of range lands. Window and water erosion and salinization 
of irrigated and nonirrigated land are serious locally, primarily in small areas 
across the southern part of the continent, and their economic impact probably 
exceeds that due to overgrazing. Land degradation is usual around farming 
communities and popular tourist areas such as Ayers Rock.
<P>Overgrazing began 50 to 100 years ago with settlement of the interior arid 
lands at a time when there was no information on the carrying capacity of range 
land, and little knowledge of climatic averages and extremes. During the first 
quarter of the 20th century, problems of wind and water erosion, salinization 
and waterlogging of irrigated land, and saline seepage of dryland areas arose as 
cultivation spread into the drier areas. Remedial action was undertaken on a 
concerted basis in the 1930s and l940s when states enacted soil conservation 
legislation and established units to correct land abuses and prevent further 
deterioration. At present, it probably is safe to say that overgrazing is much 
less of a problem than it was before 1940, that wind and water erosion still 
occur but to a lesser degree than before, that salinization of irrigated land in 
the Murray River catchment (watershed) is increasing, and that saline seepage of 
semiarid and subhumid lands is expanding steadily.
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>About 25 percent of Australia's arid regions are unoccupied (Condon, 1978) 
due to the unpalatability of spinifex grasses or to the remoteness of the land 
from population centers. Most of the remaining 75 percent is moderately 
desertified (<A href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig4.gif">Figure 
4</A>). Severe desertification is most extensive in the saltbush-bluebush 
(Atriplex-Maireana) vegetation type occurring in New South Wales and South 
Australia, where overgrazing has caused degeneration of the plant cover. 
Degradation of the vegetation due to overgrazing has also been severe on the 
fine-textured lowland soils (Vertisols) of eastern Australia and in the flood 
plains and surrounding slopes of coastal river valleys, particularly the 
Gascoyne, Ord, and Victoria catchments in Western Australia and the Northern 
Territory. Gully erosion has been severe on the Ord River catchment and 
significant on the other catchments, with greatly increased runoff where the 
trampling of livestock has developed water-repellent surface crusts. The 
presence of large numbers of feral donkeys in the Victoria River watershed 
compounds the problem of grazing control there.
<P>Areas delineated on the map as severely desertified are not uniformly 
degraded. The typical spotty character of desertification shows up in river 
catchments as badly overgrazed and gullied land on flood plains and on the 
gentle slopes adjoining them, with moderately desertified areas in the less 
accessible parts of those shrub steppe zones.
<P>Distribution of saline seeps on drylands, and salinized and waterlogged 
irrigated lands (Mabbutt, 1978), is also spotty. Seepage of salt-laden water on 
slopes has plagued cultivated lands in the semiarid and subhumid regions of 
Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria for decades. 
The resulting saline soils on lower slopes and in waterlogged depressions 
ordinarily cover a few or several hectares and are surrounded by nonsaline 
soils. In Western Australia where the problem is most acute, seepage of saline 
groundwater into streams has also had a significant adverse effect on water 
quality.
<P>Waterlogging in the Murray River and its tributaries is characterized by 
groundwater mounds affecting tens of thousands of hectares of irrigated land 
(Pels, 1978). The high groundwater levels lead to secondary salinization of 
soils as the salts originally present in the subsoils are carried to the surface 
through evaporation from the shallow water tables. Since waterlogging and 
salinization are functions of the irrigation water management and the presence 
or absence of a drainage system, salty land is interspersed with nonsalty land.
<P>Wind and water erosion have been severe in the past but are less so now, by 
and large. Wind erosion is an old problem in the grazing and cultivated lands of 
New South Wales (Wagner, 1978) and the wheat lands of the Murray Mallee 
(Matheson, 1978). One of the special problems in the semiarid Australia is the 
appearance of "scalds," when sandy surface soils are blown or washed away and 
the slowly permeable subsoil of texture-contrast (duplex) soils is exposed. 
Revegetating scalds is difficult unless steps are taken to impound water on the 
surface. Mining towns such as Broken Hill have experienced accelerated wind 
erosion and dust storms as the land around the towns was denuded of vegetation.
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>A 1969 report on land degradation in Australia (Newman and Condon, 1969) 
included an estimate that about 14 percent of the arid rangelands were severely 
degenerated in pastoral value, 23 percent were moderately degenerated, and 63 
percent showed minor, little, or no degradation. Condon (1978) notes that much 
of the serious erosion and degeneration of rangelands that was evident until the 
late 1940s was a consequence of heavy use during the late 1800s. Since the 1940s 
there has been considerable improvement in range conditions, partly due to 
abnormally favorable rainfall over the last thirty years. The magnitude of 
desertification in Australia is shown in <A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab5.gif">Table 5</A>.
<P>About 1 percent of the cultivated land in Western Australia is affected by 
saline seepage, with lesser percentages affected in the other states. Northcote 
and Skene (1972) estimate that 85,000 hectares of irrigated land in Australia 
are salt-affected, most of it in the Murray Basin. They also state that at least 
197,000 hectares of dryland are affected by secondary salinization. Waterlogging 
and salinization go hand-in-hand in the Murray region.
<P>Techniques to control desertification are well-known in Australia, the 
problem is recognized as a serious one, and state agencies are available to 
assist in carrying out reclamation and prevention programs. Grazing pressure 
probably has been reduced by half since the late 1800s and early 1900s and wind 
and water erosion in the more populous southern part of the continent is much 
less of a problem now. Soil salinity and waterlogging are more difficult to 
control because of the cost arising from the special conditions in the Murray 
irrigated area. One method used to dispose of saline drainage water without 
increasing the salinity of the Murray River water downstream is to divert it 
into evaporation basins. The principle is good but the cost is high and there 
are uncertainties about future contamination of groundwater by effluents from 
the basins.
<P><B>NORTH AMERICA</B>
<P>Overgrazing has left a lasting imprint on the arid lands of North America, 
and little has been accomplished in attempts to restore the land to its original 
productivity. Wind and water erosion are extensive and salinization and 
waterlogging-- of varying degrees of severity--are common in nearly all of the 
irrigated valleys. At present, desertification probably has been stabilized, 
with some improvement in plant cover of rangelands and in control of erosion and 
waterlogging over the past 30 years. Salinization of irrigated land is still 
occurring and the dryland saline seep problem is getting worse.
<P>The overgrazing that destroyed or severely altered the original grass cover 
of the rangelands of Mexico and the United States began in Mexico after the 
Spanish conquest and spread into the U.S. Southwest. By the early part of the 
l9th century, overgrazing was already a fact on both sides of the international 
boundary. With the explosive expansion of cattle numbers in the Southwest when 
the railroads arrived, range carrying capacities were greatly exceeded, and that 
situation continued well into the 20th century. The increased gully (arroyo) 
formation that occurred in overgrazed rangelands during the latter part of the 
l9th century has been associated with range deterioration, erosion, 
salinization, and waterlogging first received attention from research 
organizations in the late 1800s and early l900s. Many of the basic principles 
for controlling desertification were established at that time. However, 
application of the principles did not become widespread until the 1940s and 
195Os. Even though solutions are available now, much remains to be done to put 
them into practice.
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>There are about 450 million hectares in the arid regions of Canada, the 
United States, and Mexico. Approximately two-thirds of that total is moderately 
desertified and less than one-third severely desertified, with a considerable 
area of slightly desertified land and four small delineations of very severely 
desertified land (<A href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig5.gif">Figure 
5</A>).
<P>In general, rangelands are moderately desertified in the north and severely 
desertified in the south. The dividing line approximates the ecotone between 
sagebrush (cool climate) and creosote bush (hot climate). Desertification is the 
result of a combination of overgrazing and water erosion. The four delineations 
of very severely desertified land on the map are in rangelands. Three of those 
four areas in New Mexico, Texas, and Chihuahua suffered first from overgrazing, 
then from wind erosion. The result is small hummocks of mesquite-topped sand 
dunes separated by completely barren blow-outs. The fourth-- and largest--of the 
very severely desertified areas is on the Navajo Indian Reservation of northern 
New Mexico and Arizona. Overgrazing by sheep has removed most of the perennial 
grasses and exposed the easily eroded, shale-derived soils to extensive sheet 
and gully erosion. It is unlikely that any of those four areas will recover 
naturally in the next hundred or more years, even if grazing is completely 
prohibited.
<P>Wind erosion on dry-farmed lands is the second most extensive desertification 
process. The ravages of the drought-inspired Dust Bowl of the 1930s were but an 
extreme example of the damage wind erosion has caused in the western Great 
Plains, the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. Wind erosion of cultivated land, 
whether dry farmed or irrigated, has been a problem ever since the original sod 
cover was broken in the dry regions. It is an ever-present threat, worsening 
during droughts and lessening during wet periods, but always occurring 
some-where every year. While sandy soils are the most susceptible, even line 
textured soils will blow when conditions are right, and along with the dust goes 
organic matter and nutrient elements. The introduction of sprinkler irrigation 
systems, especially the center pivot systems, has enabled previously suitable 
rolling sandy lands to be cropped successfully. If and when those soils are 
abandoned, for reasons of economy or shortage of water, the United States will 
face an even greater wind erosion threat than it has had to cope with in the 
past.
<P>Accelerated water erosion has been especially serious on overgrazed 
rangelands and on cropland in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest and in 
the highlands of Mexico. Normal geologic erosion has been severe in the Badlands 
of South Dakota and in the shale materials of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New 
Mexico but man has managed to make matters worse through overgrazing and 
cultivation.
<P>While salinity and waterlogging problems are found in nearly every irrigated 
valley, the only areas large enough to be shown are in the San Joaquin Valley of 
California, the contiguous Imperial and Mexicali valleys, and the lower valley 
of the Rio Grande. Land degradation is more severe in the Mexicali Valley than 
in the adjoining Imperial Valley because (1) the salinity of the irrigation 
water is worse where Mexico diverts Colorado River water than where the Imperial 
Valley does, and (2) the Mexicali Valley does not have the intensive drainage 
network that the Imperial Valley has. Waterlogging is more of a problem in the 
northern states of the United States, whereas the combination of waterlogging 
and salinization is more serious in the south. Serious salinity problems are 
associated with marine shales in the numerous small irrigated valleys in the 
upper Colorado River watershed.
<P>The special problem of saline seeps in nonirrigated croplands is widespread 
in the states of Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota and in the prairie 
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta (Vander Pluym, 1978). The 
affected areas are too scattered to be delineated on the map.
<P>Soil compaction and soil crusting are problems associated with medium-and 
fine-textured soils. Man-induced compacted subsoil layers are especially common 
in fine-textured irrigated soils, and in medium-to moderately coarse-textured 
dryland soils. Surface crusting occurs on irrigated, dryland, and rangeland 
soils.
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>Nearly 90 percent of North American arid lands are moderately and severely 
desertified (<A href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab6.gif">Table 6</A>). 
The status of the U.S. rangelands does not appear to have been much improved in 
recent years, and less than 20 percent is producing anywhere near its potential. 
It is likely that the same condition prevails in Mexico.
<P>Data on the status of wind and water erosion in the arid regions are not 
available. A 1979 report of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service said that 58 
percent of the nation's cropland needed conservation treatment of an unspecified 
character. That figure was down from 64 percent in 1967. The major conservation 
treatment undoubtedly would be water erosion control.
<P>An indication of the magnitude of the wind erosion problem can be obtained 
from annual surveys conducted by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service for the 
Great Plains. Since 1935, surveys have been made of the amount of land damaged 
by wind erosion in susceptible parts of the Great Plains. Annual totals have 
varied from about 400,000 hectares to a maximum of 6,000,000 hectares. The 
lowest amount of land damage occurred during the wet 1940s and 1960s; the 
highest was in 1955 during a protracted drought. In any one year, the percentage 
of damaged crop-land varied from 0.6 to 9 percent of the total cropland 
surveyed. There is no discernible trend upward or downward in the area damaged; 
the dryness of the particular year seems to determine how bad wind erosion will 
be.
<P>Wind erosion in the prairie provinces of Canada--and the associated loss in 
soil fertility--has long been recognized as a serious problem (Soil Research 
Laboratory Staff, 1949). Soil and crop conditions are similar on both sides of 
the international boundary in the northern Great Plains, and so are erosional 
problems. Wind erosion is much less of a problem than water erosion in the arid 
regions of Mexico, where sandy soils are less prevalent in cropped areas than is 
the case in Canada and the United States.
<P>Salinization is estimated to affect adversely about 25 percent of the 
irrigated land in the United States and a somewhat greater percentage in Mexico. 
Dryland saline seepage is a Canada-United States problem, with about 0.8 million 
hectares severely affected and perhaps another 2.7 million slightly or 
moderately affected. Waterlogging may affect about the same area as salinization 
but the two problems are not always found together.
<P>Techniques for controlling desertification in North America are well-known. 
Recognition of the seriousness of the problem varies from year to year, usually 
depending on the amount of notoriety droughts or floods receive. In the United 
States, where soil conservation has been given considerable financial support at 
the federal level, only about one-third of the nation's cropland has been 
adequately treated against soil erosion. Much less than one-third of the 
depleted rangeland has been improved. The situation may be better in Canada but 
probably is worse in Mexico.
<P>The reasons for the relatively poor performance in combating desertification 
are numerous. High among them is the emphasis on short-term versus long-term 
benefits (Boggess et al., 1979), inability to finance improvements, lack of 
clear-cut proof that control is profitable in the immediate future, and the 
absence of a public sense of urgency toward controlling land degradation 
(General Accounting Office, 1977).
<P><B>SOUTH AMERICA</B>
<P>Overgrazing, cultivation of unsuitable land, land degradation by 
woodcutting--and the associated water erosion--are long-standing problems in the 
arid regions of South America. Wind erosion is a major threat in the semiarid 
pampas in Argentina, where moving sand dunes have ruined much land. Salinity and 
waterlogging have adversely affected irrigated regions in western Argentina, 
particularly along the Rio Salado, and in the numerous narrow irrigated valleys 
crossing the coastal plain of Peru. The very large salinas and salarea (salt 
lakes) found in western Argentina, northern Chile, and the altiplano of Bolivia 
and Chile are of natural origin rather than being due to man's activities. There 
is little evidence of land improvement, and conditions are either worsening, or 
at least not improving, nearly everywhere.
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>Heavy woodcutting for mine timbers and fuel accompanied the settling of 
western South America by the Spaniards in the 16th and 17th centuries. Along 
with that went localized overgrazing of livestock and the cultivation of the 
nearby slopes, with the inevitable accelerated erosion, It was not until the 
19th and 20th centuries, however, that land degradation on the slopes of the 
Andes Mountains and the coastal ranges become widespread. Population increases 
and land tenure systems in effect in most countries of South America have 
combined to put further pressure on the arid regions in recent years (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig6.gif">Figure 6</A>).
<P>Desertification has been held to a moderate level in semiarid northeastern 
Brazil by the erratic character of the rainfall there. Land destruction probably 
would have been much worse if the rainfall were more reliable and if severe 
droughts did not occur so frequently. The original caatinga vegetation is 
xerophytic and is adapted to the long dry periods that occur each year (Banco do 
Nordeste do Brasil, 1964).
<P>The coast of Peru is crossed by a large number of short rivers flowing from 
the Andes to the Pacific Ocean. Many of the irrigated valleys are affected to 
some degree by salinization and waterlogging. The valleys constitute only a 
small part of the coast desert of Peru and even less of the Chilean desert. Most 
of the desert has experienced little development or desertification.
<P>Farther south, in the semiarid coastal mountains of Chile, land degradation 
due to overgrazing and cultivation of sloping lands has been severe around 
population centers. Indiscriminate woodcutting has also been an important 
negative factor in the development of the region.
<P>In Argentina, which has more arid land than any other South American country, 
overgrazing has led to the degradation of range vegetation from the high 
plateaus in the north to the cold Patagonian desert in the south. Wind erosion 
plagues both range and cultivated lands, especially in the southern half of the 
nation.
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>Overgrazing of rangelands has been the most destructive aspect of 
desertification in all the arid regions of South America. There has been a 
progressive elimination of palatable species by cattle, sheep, and goats over 
many decades. Along with this has gone the cutting of trees for timber, 
firewood, and charcoal. In the Gran Chaco of Argentina it is difficult to find 
good stands of the valuable red and white quebracho trees that once grew 
everywhere.
<P>Water erosion has followed overgrazing through the continent, and wind 
erosion has become an acute problem in parts of Argentina (Prego et al., 1971). 
The most serious wind damage has been done in the dry-farmed areas of central 
Argentina where cultivation has led to the formation of mobile dunes. In 1963 an 
estimated 16,000,000 hectares of land were affected to varying degrees by wind 
erosion, and the situation has become worse since then. Soil fertility has 
declined and runoff has increased.
<P>Salinization and waterlogging affect about 20 percent of the irrigated land 
in the coastal valley of Peru (Comite Peruano de Zonas Aridas, 1963) and large 
sections of the semiarid Gran Chaco, in and around the province of Santiago del 
Estero. The same problem, to a lesser degree, appears in the irrigated regions 
in arid western Argentina and in northeastern Brazil.
<P>Although only about 22 percent of the arid regions of South America are 
severely or very severely affected by desertification (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab7.gif">Table 7</A>), the problem is 
critical because the best lands have been degraded and the degradation is 
continuing. Virtually no improvement of grazing lands has occurred anywhere, nor 
have soil salinization and water-logging been controlled. Some progress has been 
made in stabilizing sand dunes in the dry farming areas of Argentina but much 
remains to be done. Water erosion in the Andes and the semiarid western coastal 
ranges continues to present problems and may be getting worse. A fast-growing 
population virtually assures greater desertification in the years ahead unless 
governments become determined to cope with the problem.
<P><B>SPAIN</B>
<P>All of the arid regions of Spain have been moderately to severely desertified 
for decades, if not for centuries (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/fig7.gif">Figure 7</A>). Most of the 
damage has been done by heavy grazing and woodcutting, but wind and water 
erosion on cultivated land has also been extensive. Salinization and 
waterlogging of irrigated land is a major problem in parts of the Ebro River 
watershed in northeastern Spain. Destruction of the native vegetation and the 
subsequent water erosion of thin soils on slopes has had a devastating effect on 
the plant environment and on the potential productivity of the land. Mobile sand 
dunes are found along the Mediterranean coast.
<P><B>Desertification Characteristics</B>
<P>During the past several centuries, heavy grazing by sheep and goats has led 
to the destruction of much of the herbaceous and woody vegetation on the 
noncultivated land (Albareda, 1955). Water erosion has been severe on the 
overgrazed slopes as a result of the loss of vegetative cover and the torrential 
character of the rains. Cutting of wood for fuel and construction and the 
extension of dryland farming into the pasture lands has accompanied overgrazing. 
Plant cover has changed to a more xeric type and surface runoff has increased.
<P>A monoculture of grain in the cultivated regions has depleted the native 
fertility of the soil and has been responsible for increasing the susceptibility 
of the land to wind and water erosion. Extended droughts from time to time have 
served to accelerate desertification. Water erosion is severe nearly everywhere 
on sloping land.
<P>Salinization and waterlogging do not affect a high percentage of the total 
cultivated land in Spain but important and large areas of affected soils do 
occur in irrigated valleys. The major salt-affected areas in the northeast are 
in the Ebro River watershed in the vicinity of Zaragosa and Herida. Seepage 
water from irrigation on the higher land has caused waterlogging and 
salinization of lower-lying areas (Martinez, 1978). Gypsum is a common 
constituent of the soils.
<P>The other major salt-affected areas are in southwest Spain near the coast. 
The soils are composed of fine-textured sediments that were subjected regularly 
to flooding by seawater in the past. Surface and internal drainage of the 
irrigated land is poor and water tables generally are close to the surface. 
Pumping is required to lower the water tables (Ayers et al., 1960).
<P><B>Magnitude of Desertification</B>
<P>Approximately 50 percent of Spain is arid. In the arid regions about 70 
percent is moderately desertified and 30 percent is severely desertified (<A 
href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-193/tab8.gif">Table 8</A>).
<P>Virtually all of the rangeland has suffered severe land degradation. Range 
productivity is probably stabilized at a low level now, with little improvement 
anywhere. Erosion continues on the extensive dryfarm lands except in a few 
places where soil and water conservation measures have been instituted. Soil 
fertility remains low.
<P>Salinization and waterlogging affect about 240,000 hectares of irrigated land 
to various degrees (Ayers et al., 1960). Reclamation has been undertaken in 
several areas. Because of the need for more agricultural production and the 
gradual worsening of the salt problem, irrigation has received special attention 
in recent decades. Much remains to be done.
<P>Soil and water conservation techniques for dryland farming are known but 
their application to the field is limited. Range management is not a 
well-supported science in Spain. Considerable progress has been made in the 
reclamation of saline soils and procedures for doing so are quite well-known 
(Martinez, 1978).
