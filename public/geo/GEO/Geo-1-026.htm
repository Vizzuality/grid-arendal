                                INTRODUCTION


1.   The present report was prepared in accordance with the General
Assembly resolution 50/113 for the fifth session of the Commission on
Sustainable Development, which will be devoted to preparations for the
special session of the General Assembly to be held from 23 to 27 June 1997
for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of
Agenda 21.  The report also takes into account relevant provisions of
General Assembly resolution 51/181 concerning the special session.

2.   This report contains a global assessment of the current status of
economic and social development and environmental sustainability, followed
by an appraisal of progress made since the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED), focusing on the main achievements and
unrealized expectations.  It also attempts to identify the main challenges
and priorities in the implementation of Agenda 21 and of other outcomes of
UNCED for the period after the 1997 review, including the future role of
the Commission on Sustainable Development.  The structure of the report
takes into account the three main interrelated components of sustainable
development, namely economic growth, social development and environmental
sustainability.

3.   The report does not analyse progress or lack thereof in the
implementation of individual chapters of Agenda 21, nor does it describe
all relevant activities or policy changes undertaken as a follow-up to
UNCED at the international, regional and national levels or by the major
groups.  More detailed information on these actions can be found in the
addenda to this report (E/CN.17/1997/2/Add.1-30) as well as in document
E/CN.17/1997/5, which assesses progress achieved at the national level on
the basis of information contained in the "country profiles" prepared in
cooperation with the Governments concerned.

4.   A number of conclusions presented in the report are based on the
information contained in other reports prepared for the 1997 review, in
particular in the reports on critical trends in sustainable development
(E/CN.17/1997/3), the results of the comprehensive freshwater assessment
(E/CN.17/1997/9) and activities that pose a major threat to the environment
(E/CN.17/1997/4).  Furthermore, in the preparation of the report account
was taken of the outcomes of other recent international conferences, as
well as of other major studies and reports that deal with issues relevant
to sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21.


                            I.  GLOBAL ASSESSMENT

        A.  Sustainable development in the years since the United Nations
            Conference on Environment and Development

5.   At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held
at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Governments adopted Agenda 21, a programme of
action for sustainable development worldwide, 1/ the Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development 2/ and the Non-legally Binding Authoritative
Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management,
Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests (the
Forest Principles). 3/  Sustainable development may be regarded as the
progressive and balanced achievement of sustained economic development,
improved social equity and environmental sustainability.  Accordingly,
Agenda 21 stresses the importance of integrated policy development, citizen
participation in decision-making including the full participation of women,
institutional capacity-building and global partnerships involving many
stakeholders.

6.   Sustainable development is about change:  change in development paths;
change in the production and consumption patterns that determine how the
needs - and often wants - of people are met and, in turn, contribute to -
or hinder - development.  It is evident that all countries must have the
opportunity to realize economic growth in order to meet their essential
needs.  But the quality of growth is as important as its quantity.  Is it
promoting equity?  Does it contribute to meeting the food, health care,
safe water, shelter and educational needs of the developing countries, in
particular the least developed countries?  Does it lead to an environment
which is conducive to a healthy and productive life, as advocated in
principle 1 of the Rio Declaration?  Does it take a precautionary approach
to exploitation of the planet's ecosystems?  Economic development, social
development and environmental protection are mutually reinforcing
components of sustainable development.  The importance given to each of the
components may vary from country to country.

7.   The series of global conferences organized by the United Nations in
the years since UNCED have all incorporated the fundamental principles and
objectives of Agenda 21.  The analysis and the plans of action emerging
from these conferences are essential to our understanding of sustainable
development and to ultimately achieving it.

8.   The five years since UNCED have been characterized by accelerated
"globalization", which refers to the growing interaction of countries in
world trade, foreign direct investment and capital markets.  The
globalization process has been abetted by technological advances in
transport and communications and by a rapid liberalization and deregulation
of trade and capital flows, at both the national and international levels. 
Democracy has continued to spread and become more consolidated in countries
where democratic forms of government have only recently been established. 
The end of the cold war has permitted an overall reduction in military
expenditures as a share of gross domestic product (GDP).  Yet preoccupation
with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to
some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation, if not outright
reductions, in the volume of official development assistance (ODA).  At the
same time, regional conflicts, communal strife and civil war have visited
unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of
sustainable development.


                             B.  Economic growth

                          1.  Economic performance

9.   During the period 1992-1996 growth of GDP in the developing countries
averaged about 5.3 per cent per year, compared with 3.1 per cent during the
1980s and 4.2 per cent during the period 1991-1992.  This acceleration of
GDP growth has permitted per capita GDP to rise by more than 3 per cent per
year during the past four years; moreover, growth gradually spread as the
number of countries exhibiting increasing per capita GDP rose from an
average of 55 countries (containing about 83 per cent of the population
living in developing countries) during the years 1990-1993 to 75 countries
(accounting for 96 per cent of the population) in 1996.  This pattern was
not, however, shared by sub-Saharan African countries and least developed
countries where per capita GDP continued to fall or stagnate through 1995. 
Worldwide, unequal income distribution within countries means that over 1.5
billion people did not share in economic growth and experienced declining
per capita incomes in the 1990s.

10.  This improved growth performance was due more to successful national
policies than to external circumstances.  Growth of world output was
considerably slower during the first half of the 1990s compared with the
decade of the 1980s.  Consequently, during the period 1991-1993 growth in
world trade was relatively slow and real commodity terms of trade continued
the decline that began in 1989.  These trends were reversed during the
period 1994-1996 with the resumption of sustained growth in world output. 
Developing countries' export volumes increased more rapidly than world
trade throughout the 1990s, averaging about 12 per cent per year during the
period 1994-1996.  Export volume growth was exceptional in Latin America,
South and East Asia and China.  The strengthening of regional trading
arrangements was an important factor in explaining the export growth
performance of developing countries as well as their continued penetration
of markets for manufactured goods in developed market economies. 
Accompanying the GDP and export performance of developing countries and
China, manufacturing value added has grown as well, increasing its share in
world totals from about 15 per cent in 1991 to about 18 per cent in 1995.


                         2.  Energy and material use

11.  Economic growth and social development depend on energy use.  World
energy consumption has risen steadily and by 1993 was more than 40 per cent
higher than in 1973.  Global demand for energy continues to rise to meet
the needs of a growing world population.  The growth in per capita energy
demand will continue because an increase in per capita energy is linked to
the growth of the world economy, particularly for developing economies. 
Major increases in energy-generating capacity are still required in many
developing countries if basic human needs are to be met.  Over 2 billion
people still have little or no access to public and/or commercial energy
supplies.

12.  Consumption of some materials is stabilizing in the industrialized
countries, as a result of improved efficiency and economic restructuring,
but consumption is rising rapidly in developing economies.  However,
reflecting the very large differences in per capita income between regions,
per capita consumption of commercial materials remains far higher in
developed countries.


                           3.  Development finance

13.  Trends in international capital flows have been mixed.  Net capital
flows of private direct investment, portfolio investment and commercial
bank lending have increased during the period 1992-1995, but have been
concentrated in a relatively small number of developing countries.  Net
flows of official development assistance, on which least developed and
several other low-income countries depend, after increasing in 1993,
declined in real terms in both 1994 and 1995.  These trends in ODA are
clearly disappointing when viewed against the expectation at UNCED for new
and additional net flows.  Perhaps reflecting heightened concern for social
development and environmental management, there has been, however, a small
but noticeable increase in the proportion of official development finance
flowing into these areas.


                           C.  Social development

14.  Data on social development, other than demographic data, are still not
monitored as frequently or as comprehensively as economic data.  For the
most part, there is little data more recent than for 1993.  Such data as
are available generally show a small but positive change in a number of
social indicators, and that this progress is evident in most world regions. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, however, a number of indicators show worsening
trends during the 1990s.  In many countries in transition also, several
social indicators show worsening trends.


                          1.  Demographic dynamics

15.  According to the United Nations 1996 Revision 4/ of global population
and demographic estimates and projections, population calculations for the
period 1990-1995 indicate that growth fell faster, national fertility
declines were broader and deeper and migration flows larger than previous
estimates had indicated.  The latest medium fertility variant projection
shows that the world population will stabilize at about 9.4 billion in
2050, almost half a billion lower than the figure projected in the 1994
Revision.5/


                                 2.  Health

16.  One measure of global health - life expectancy - increased slightly
between 1985-1990 and 1990-1995.  Increases were registered in most
countries but 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and 17 countries with
economies in transition experienced declines in life expectancy.  Another
important health indictor, per capita dietary energy supply (kilocalories),
shows that in 1990-1992 as compared with the period 1979-1981, increases
occurred in nearly all world regions.  The exceptions were Eastern Europe
and sub-Saharan Africa.  Increases were largest in South, East and South-
East Asia.  However, the increase was negligible in Latin America. 
Estimates of the prevalence of underweight children display similar
patterns.  Eight hundred and forty million people in the world suffer from
malnutrition.  A number of infectious diseases may be eradicated in the
near future, given continued efforts, but others, notably malaria, are
increasing.

17.  Excessive environmental pollution is affecting the health of millions
of people in urban agglomerations in developing countries.  While the
developing countries as a whole have narrowed the "health gap" with the
industrialized countries in several important indicators, including life
expectancy and infant and child mortality, the gap is widening between the
least developed countries and other developing countries.


                      3.  Drinking water and sanitation

18.  In spite of efforts since the start of the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade in 1981, some 20 per cent of the world's
population lacks access to safe water and 50 per cent lacks access to safe
sanitation.  At any given time, an estimated 50 per cent of the population
in developing countries is suffering from water-related diseases caused
either directly by infection, or indirectly by disease-carrying organisms. 
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 5 million people die
each year from diseases caused by unsafe drinking water and a lack of
sanitation.  In terms of the economic impact of poor water supply systems,
it has been estimated that the provision of safe water supply, suitably
located, could save over 10 million person-years of efforts in fetching
water, mostly by women and female children, in developing countries.  Water
supplies in many cities of developing countries are intermittent, and an
increasing number of peri-urban poor are without services and are often
left at the mercy of private vendors charging exorbitant prices.


                                4.  Education

19.  Indicators of education such as enrolment ratios and adult literacy
show improvement in all developing country regions.  Between 1990 and 1993
combined gross enrolment ratios for all levels of education increased, with
those of females increasing slightly more than those of males.  However,
increases were very slight in sub-Saharan Africa and in the least developed
countries, groupings where gross enrolment ratios are very much lower than
in other regions.  Rates of illiteracy among adults appear to have declined
steadily in all developing regions, including South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa; illiteracy rates for all developing countries averaged 29 per cent
in 1993.


                                 5.  Poverty

20.  Both economic growth and investment in human resources have impacts on
the incidence of poverty; moreover, environmental degradation and poverty
can interact in a vicious circle.  Data on the incidence of poverty
indicate that the percentage of those living in poverty in developing
countries declined slightly between 1990 and 1993 but all of the
improvement was concentrated in East Asia and the Pacific, where the
absolute number of poor declined as well.  In other developing country
regions the number of poor actually increased; globally, the numbers of
people living in absolute poverty rose to 1.3 billion in 1993.  Women
continue to be disproportionately affected.  In rural areas, the number of
women in absolute poverty rose by nearly 50 per cent in the past two
decades and they now constitute a substantial majority of the world's poor.


                      D.  Environmental sustainability

21.  Services provided by the environment are essential for economic
activity, human health and the preservation of life itself.  Imprudent
depletion or degradation of natural resources or exceeding the capacity of
air, soil and water to absorb pollutants will undermine long-term prospects
for economic growth just as surely as will failure to maintain and increase
stocks of physical capital or failure to invest in human development.


                          1.  Impacts of energy use

22.  Current forms of energy production and use, primarily based on fossil
fuels, have serious adverse effects on the environment:  emissions
contaminate air, water and soil and contribute to global warming. 
Developed market economies have achieved a significant reduction in energy
intensity due to improvements in generation and end-use efficiency in many
socio-economic sectors.  However, the increased volume of economic activity
has offset these gains, and emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise. 
Experiences in developing countries have varied considerably, even among
those countries within the same region, because of the significant
differences in their resources base, energy demand structures, economic
situation, technological capacity and population and development strategy.

23.  Most developed countries, and a number of middle-income developing
countries, have experienced significant reductions in some other energy-
related emissions, notably sulphur dioxide.  The resulting improvements in
local air and water quality can be attributed both to technological change
responding to the operation of market forces, and to increasingly stringent
regulation of ambient quality standards and emissions, especially from
motor vehicles.


                               2.  Freshwater

24.  The analysis carried out under the Comprehensive Assessment of the
Freshwater Resources of the World gives rise to serious concerns as to the
sustainability of current pathways of water resources development and
utilization in many developed and developing countries alike.  Global
demand for water has increased dramatically over the past century and it is
estimated that more than 8 per cent of the world's population now lives in
countries that are highly water stressed and another 25 per cent in
countries that are experiencing moderate to high water stress.  If current
trends in water use persist, two thirds of the world's population could be
living in countries experiencing moderate or high water stress by 2025.

25.  The present situation and current trends have serious implications in
terms of economic development and food production.  Unless managed with a
view to achieving much greater efficiency, for which there is considerable
potential, water resources could become a serious factor limiting
socio-economic development in many developing countries.  Efforts to
increase efficiency and maximize economic benefits will tend to shift water
users away from low value products.  This, in turn, will have a serious
impact on poor farmers operating inefficient irrigation schemes unless
policies are designed and implemented to mitigate the impact of such a
shift.

26.  In addition, a number of developed countries are facing stressful
conditions with regard to the utilization of their water resources, in many
cases due to deteriorating quality.  Freshwater reserves continue to be
used as a sink for the dumping of wastes from urban and industrial sources,
agricultural chemicals and other human activities.  Current estimates
indicate, for instance, that about 90 per cent of waste waters from urban
areas are discharged without any treatment in many developing countries. 
Altogether, water quality has degraded rapidly, and in some regions has
become so bad that groundwater is not suitable even for industrial use.


                    3.  Soil quality and food production

27.  The most recent comprehensive survey of soil degradation (GLASOD)
indicates that faulty agricultural practices are a significant cause of
soil degradation; examples include nutrient mining due to cropping
intensification, insufficient fertilizer inputs, erosion and overgrazing by
livestock.  As much as 10 per cent of the earth's vegetated surface is now
at least moderately degraded.  Continued degradation of the agricultural
land base will have serious implications for future food security at the
local level.

28.  It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural
production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will
come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation
in developing countries, much of which is irrigated.  In Africa and Latin
America and the Caribbean, increases in yields are expected to contribute
upwards of 50 per cent of production increases.  An additional 21 per cent
of the increase in production is expected to be achieved through a
projected expansion of harvested areas, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
Latin America and East Asia.  Of the projected 124 million hectares in new
harvested areas, new irrigated lands are viewed as being limited to 45
million hectares.  Increases in cropping intensity are expected to
contribute the remaining 13 per cent of the total increases in food
production.

29.  While the medium-term prospects for increasing food production are
good, trends in soil quality and the management of irrigated land raise
serious questions about longer-term sustainability.  It is estimated that
about 20 per cent of the world's 250 million hectares of irrigated land are
already degraded to the point where crop production is significantly
reduced.


                              4.  Forest cover

30.  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) in the State of the World's Forests, 1995, deforestation and
degradation remain the major issues.  For the period 1980-1990, the annual
estimated loss in natural forest area is 12.1 million hectares. 
Disaggregated estimates are as follows:  global change in forests and other
wooded lands was -10.0 million hectares per year; natural forest loss in
developing countries, 16.3 million hectares per year; increase in
plantations in developing countries, 3.2 million hectares per year.  The
rates and causes of deforestation differ greatly between countries and
regions; determining factors include population density and growth rates,
levels and rates of development, the structure of property rights and
cultural systems.  Rates of tropical deforestation increased in each of the
past three decades in all tropical regions and are currently highest in
Asia.  There is increasing concern about the decline in forest quality
associated with intensive use of forests and unregulated access.

31.  The largest losses of forest area are taking place in the tropical
moist deciduous forests, the zone best suited to human settlement and
agriculture; recent estimates suggest that nearly two thirds of tropical
deforestation worldwide is due to farmers clearing land for agriculture.  A
growing proportion of commercial wood consumption needs in developing
countries appears to be coming from plantations which, when well managed,
are proving highly productive.  In temperate developing countries,
increases in plantation forest exceeded the declines in natural forests. 
There appears to have been a net gain in area of forest and other wooded
land in most regions.


                  5.  The marine environment and fisheries

32.  Coastal ecosystems, including wetlands, tidal flats, saltwater
marshes, mangrove swamps coastal nursery areas and the flora and fauna that
depend on them, are particularly at risk from industrial pollution and
urban land conversion.  Coastal urban centres are already home to
approximately 1 billion people worldwide and are experiencing unprecedented
growth, much of it in developing countries.  According to a recent study
undertaken by the World Resources Institute, about half the world's coasts
are threatened by development-related activities.  The harmful effects of
coastal degradation are often felt first by subsistence fishers and small-
scale fleets which operate close to shore.  Wider impacts include
intensified coastal erosion, decreased protection from storm damage and
loss of biodiversity.

33.  The marine fisheries account for about 82 per cent of the total global
fish harvest.  The marine harvest has continued to increase slowly since
1970 despite a small decrease in early 1990; the additional production is
coming mainly from highly fluctuating small pelagic wild resources and
marine and coastal aquaculture.  According to a new assessment made by FAO
in late 1996, 25 per cent of the world's marine fisheries are being fished
at their level of maximum productivity and 35 per cent are overfished
(yields are declining).  In order to maintain current per capita
consumption of fish, global fish harvests (110 million tons in 1994) must
be increased; FAO estimates that much of the increase must come from mainly
inland aquaculture.  This expansion is not without risk, since aquaculture
is a known source of water pollution, wetland loss and mangrove swamp
destruction.  Expansion will also be constrained by land-based pollution.


                              6.  Biodiversity

34.  Biodiversity is increasingly under threat from development, which
destroys or degrades natural habitats, and pollution from a variety of
sources.  The first comprehensive global assessment of biodiversity was
released in 1995 at the second meeting of the Conference of the Parties to
the Convention on Biological Diversity. 6/  It put the total number of
species at close to 14 million and found that between 1 and 11 per cent of
the world's species per decade may be threatened by extinction.  Major
threats to species are related to threats to the ecosystems that support
them from both development and pollution.  There is, thus, a direct link to
the forest agenda.  Coastal ecosystems, which host a very large proportion
of marine species, are at great risk, with perhaps one third of the world's
coasts at high potential risk of degradation and another 17 per cent at
moderate risk.  FAO estimates that the rural poor in developing countries
depend upon biological resources to meet about 90 per cent of their needs;
the social and economic value of biodiversity is thus very high.


                      7.  Waste and hazardous materials

35.  Domestic and industrial waste production continues to increase in both
absolute and per capita terms, worldwide.  In the developed world, per
capita waste generation has increased threefold over the past 20 years; in
developing countries, it is highly likely that waste generation will double
during the next decade.  The level of awareness regarding the health and
environmental impacts of inadequate waste disposal remains rather poor;
poor sanitation and waste management infrastructure is still one of the
principal causes of death and disability for the urban poor.

36.  Toxification from dissipative use of modern materials has emerged as
an issue of concern.  Approximately 100,000 chemicals are now in commercial
use and their potential impacts on human health and ecological function
represent largely unknown risks.  Persistent organic pollutants are now so
widely distributed by air and ocean currents that they are found in the
tissues of people and wildlife everywhere; they are of particular concern
because of their high levels of toxicity and persistence in the
environment.  Pollution from heavy metals, especially from their use in
industry and mining, is also creating serious health consequences in many
parts of the world.  Incidents and accidents involving uncontrolled
radioactive sources continue to increase.  Particular risks are posed by
the legacy of contaminated areas left from military activities involving
nuclear materials.


          II.  APPRAISAL OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED SINCE THE UNITED NATIONS
               CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

37.  Since 1992, sustainable development has been more widely accepted as
an integrating concept that seeks to unify and bring together economic,
social and environmental issues in a participatory process of decision-
making.  The years since UNCED have seen a growing consensus on the need
for integrated approaches, as advocated in Agenda 21, and real progress has
been made in establishing a conceptual framework within which planning for
sustainable development can take place.  Five years after the Conference,
it is clear that the policy process is far more advanced in some areas than
others.  Some are still at the stage of defining problems and agreeing on
necessary responses.  Others have moved to the stage of target-setting and
deployment of new policy instruments to achieve change.  In a few cases,
intervention has already brought measurable results.

38.  The present section discusses the development of integrated strategies
for sustainable development at various levels of government and in the
outcomes of major international conferences.  It then evaluates recent
changes in international trade regimes and assesses progress towards
changing production and consumption patterns, a key strategic approach to
achieving sustainable development identified in Agenda 21.  Lastly, it
evaluates progress in the management of natural resources, the involvement
of various actors and means of implementation.


            A.  Developing strategies for sustainable development

39.  Following UNCED, a number of related global plans and strategies have
been agreed which attempt to translate the principles of Agenda 21 into
practice.  An important example is the Programme of Action adopted at the
Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States (Bridgetown, Barbados, 1994). 7/  The Programme of Action identifies
a number of important priority areas for sustainable development in small
island developing States (see E/CN.17/1997/14).

40.  At the regional level, the past five years have seen a number of
initiatives to formulate regional sustainable development strategies or
action plans and to establish mechanisms for regional cooperation in
implementing such initiatives.  They have often been launched as the result
of regional summits or ministerial meetings and are intended to translate
global issues into regional ones.  An example is the Regional Action
Programme on Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development in Asia and
the Pacific, 1996-2000.  In addition, integrated plans have been developed
and adopted for smaller regions that share or feel responsible for common
resources or ecosystems.  Examples are the plans for the Arctic, the Baltic
Sea and, recently initiated, the Sustainable Development Plan for the
Mediterranean.

41.  At the national level, countries ranging from China, which launched
the first national Agenda 21, to Swaziland and the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, have produced national sustainable
development strategies, national conservation strategies or environmental
action plans.  Developing countries have made particular progress in this
regard.  In some cases, this has been done with the assistance of the World
Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International
Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and some
bilateral donors.  Over 40 African countries have some sort of coordinating
mechanism to produce such plans.  Environmental factors have also been
incorporated into macroeconomic strategy.

42.  The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recognized the strategic importance
of sustainable development strategies.  It has set the target that by the
year 2005 national strategies for sustainable development are to be adopted
in all countries, so as to ensure that current trends in the loss of
environmental resources are effectively reversed at both the global and
national levels by the year 2015.

43.  Further progress in the effort to develop sustainable development
strategies must take account of such constraining factors as: 
(i) Governments, particularly of developing countries, are overloaded with
requests for various types of strategies, plans and schemes to satisfy the
requirements of international banks, lending agencies and international
organizations, which have not been adequately coordinated or prioritized;
(ii) not all governing bodies of international organizations, even within
the United Nations system, have the same understanding of the concept of
sustainable development - some have adopted programmes of environmentally
sustainable development, others have called for sustainable human
development, while others have talked of conservation or other types of
environmental plans; this has led to some confusion regarding the core
issues of sustainable development; (iii) international agreements are often
being reached faster than countries can respond effectively to agreed
requirements; (iv) Governments frequently lack the financial and staff
resources to implement the different international conferences, conventions
and agreements they have agreed to or signed; (v) capacity-building efforts
should not stop after sustainable development strategies have been
formulated, since the implementation of such strategies requires continuous
support.

44.  At the local level there has been a positive trend in the number of
cities around the world which have formulated and are implementing local
Agenda 21s.  Currently almost 2,000 local governments from 49 countries are
pursuing local Agenda 21 action plans through official planning processes
in partnership with the voluntary and private sectors in their communities. 
The "sustainable cities" process, which started in 1992, has been boosted
by the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).


                           B.  Global conferences

45.  Since 1992, a number of major United Nations conferences have made
policy advances and strengthened commitments to social aspects of
sustainable development.  The International Conference on Population and
Development (Cairo, 1994) emphasized the importance of broad-based economic
and social development, including expanded education, health care and
economic opportunities, especially for women, in reducing desired family
size and thereby reducing population growth.  The World Summit for Social
Development (Copenhagen, 1995) emphasized that social development requires
not just economic growth, but also the eradication of poverty, full
employment and social integration.  The Fourth World Conference on Women
(Beijing, 1995) pointed out that many activities crucial to sustainable
development are largely the responsibility of women, that women
disproportionately bear many of the burdens of environmental degradation,
but that women remain largely absent at all levels of policy formulation
and decision-making and that unless women's contribution to environmental
management is recognized and supported, sustainable development will remain
an elusive goal.  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), at its ninth session (Midrand, 1996), highlighted the potential
benefits of globalization and trade liberalization to developing countries
but warned of the risks of marginalization of poorer countries unable to
capitalize on new opportunities.  Habitat II (Istanbul, 1996) raised global
awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development
as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the
next century, thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social,
economic and environmental problems of cities.  Finally, the World Food
Summit (Rome, 1996) called for renewed effort to combat hunger, which
persists in the poorer regions of the world and is likely to increase in
spite of food surpluses at the global level.  All of these conferences
adopted plans of action that complement Agenda 21, superseding it in some
respects.  A number of bodies within and outside the United Nations system,
notably the Economic and Social Council, are coordinating the
implementation of those plans of action.


                  C.  International trade, economic growth and
                      sustainable development

46.  Globalization and liberalization have increased the potential for
international trade to become an unprecedented engine of growth and an
important mechanism for integrating countries into the global economy.  A
good number of developing countries have seized the opportunities and seen
the rapid growth of their economies.  Not all countries, however, have been
in a position to seize these new trading opportunities.  There is a real
risk that these countries, especially the least developed among them, and
other structurally weak economies, could become further marginalized.  At
the same time, it is widely recognized that the integration and fuller
participation of these and other developing countries and countries in
transition in the global economy would contribute substantially to the
expansion of world trade, serving the overall objectives of world economic
growth in the context of sustainable development.

47.  The completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations
was a major step by the international community towards the expansion of
the rule-based international trading system and advancing liberalization in
international trade and creating a more secure trading environment.  The
Uruguay Round furthered and consolidated the process of trade
liberalization through improvements in market access and more stringent
disciplines over trade measures.  It set out a system of multilateral trade
obligations subject to a common dispute settlement mechanism which will
place most countries at virtually the same level of multilateral obligation
within a relatively short time.  Most of the multilateral trade agreements
contain their own built-in agenda for review, possible revision and
negotiation of future commitments.

48.  It has been recognized that, during the reform programme leading to
greater liberalization of trade in agriculture, least developed and net
food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in
terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from
external sources on reasonable terms and conditions, including short-term
difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic
foodstuffs.  The plight of the least developed countries and the need to
ensure their effective participation in the world trading system is also
recognized.

49.  The least developed countries, particularly those in Africa, and other
developing countries remain constrained by weak supply capabilities and are
unable to benefit from trade.  Marginalization, both among and within
countries, has been exacerbated.  Too many people continue to live in dire
poverty.

50.  Intergovernmental deliberations of UNCTAD, the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Commission on Sustainable Development and other
international organizations have resulted in a better understanding of the
relationship between trade, environment and development.  The post-UNCED
debate has focused on, and will continue to explore, the scope of the
complementarities between trade liberalization, economic development and
environmental protection.  Governments have taken appropriate steps to
ensure that trade and environment are now firmly incorporated into the work
programmes of WTO, UNCTAD and other relevant international organizations. 
The breadth and complexity of the issues covered in the work programme of
the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) of WTO shows that further work
needs to be undertaken and ministers have directed CTE to continue work on
all items of its agenda, as contained in its report, building on the work
accomplished thus far.  Similarly, at the ninth session of UNCTAD,
Governments mandated UNCTAD to continue carrying out its special role in
promoting the integration of trade, environment and development.

51.  The Singapore Ministerial Declaration notes that full implementation
of the WTO Agreements will make an important contribution to achieving the
objectives of sustainable development.  The agenda is becoming more
balanced and integrated by enlarging the development dimension on most
issues.  Nevertheless, there is a perception that mutual understanding
between trade, environment and development communities is still evolving
and that a larger consensus still needs to be built on a common agenda to
strengthen mutual supportiveness of trade, environment and development
policies.  The Singapore Ministerial Declaration stressed the importance of
policy coordination at the national level in the area of trade and
environment.


              D.  Changing production and consumption patterns

52.  Changing consumption and production patterns in the context of
sustainable development addresses a broad range of issues, including new
concepts of economic growth and prosperity, efficient use of natural
resources, reducing waste, environmentally sound pricing, product policy
and technology transfer.  Environment and development policy-making aimed
at changing consumption and production patterns has made noticeable
progress, in particular in cooperation with international organizations and
major groups, including business and industry, local authorities and the
research community.  The issue is now prominently placed on the
international policy agenda and a number of countries have taken a lead
role in facilitating and developing international debate.

53.  At the conceptual level, important work has helped to define promising
approaches to changing consumption and production patterns, in particular
the internalization of environmental costs in goods and services, improved
efficiency in energy and materials use and demand-side management.  While
economic instruments to internalize costs remain difficult to implement,
progress has been made in improving efficiency and implementing demand-side
management schemes in many industrialized countries.  This trend has been
promoted by both environmental considerations and the financial benefits of
reduced resource and waste flows.  Increased attention is being paid by
policy makers to social instruments and the provision of adequate
infrastructure and facilities, in order to enable individuals to modify
their behaviour towards less environmentally damaging patterns.  Examples
include product labelling, information campaigns and improved recycling
schemes.

54.  The most promising developments may be seen in the increased
participation of non-governmental organizations, business, trade unions,
local communities, academics and consumer organizations in efforts to
define sustainable levels of consumption and to develop practical
programmes of action.  However, much work remains to be done in furthering
understanding of the possible impacts of changed consumption and production
patterns in industrialized countries on the development needs of developing
countries.


                       E.  Natural resource management

                             1.  The atmosphere

55.  Intensive research has led to scientific consensus within the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that human activities are
having a discernible influence on the global climate.  The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change 8/ was one of the key commitments to
emerge from UNCED and it has since been ratified by more than 150 States. 
Many of the parties listed in annex I to the Convention (OECD countries and
countries with economies in transition) have developed climate change
action plans involving policy measures, and in some cases targets, for
stabilizing or reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases.  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,
and its subsequent amendments, have already proved effective in reducing
emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and have been described as a model for
dealing with atmosphere-related issues and for constructive cooperation
between Governments, industry, scientists and non-governmental
organizations.

56.  Despite this progress, CO2 emissions in most industrialized countries
have risen over the past four years and very few countries are likely to
stabilize their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1990 levels by the year
2000.  The focus until now has been on technological solutions to increase
energy efficiency, which have often been offset by the volume of economic
activity.  There is still little movement towards strong financial
mechanisms that would make fundamental changes in energy consumption
possible and no significant new investments have been forthcoming in
promoting renewable energy systems.

57.  A positive development is the worldwide trend towards increasing
competition in the power sector.  This will be helpful to small, high
efficiency and more economical co-generation systems, while discouraging
large, less efficient and less economical stand-alone steam turbine-based
power plants.  There has also been a noticeable shift in government R&amp;D
budgets globally from the fossil energy sector to energy conservation and
renewable energy.  A further promising initiative is the World Programme on
Renewable Energies, launched at the World Solar Summit in Harare in 1996.

58.  Transport has become the single largest sectoral end-use of energy in
the OECD member countries and is the fastest growing end-use in both
developed and developing countries.  Transport-related emissions,
particularly lead, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and small particulates
now constitute a serious health hazard in many cities worldwide. 
Initiatives of the Commission on Sustainable Development and international
organizations have started the process of phasing out lead in gasoline
worldwide.  Research continues on alternative vehicle technology, including
electric and hybrid vehicles and cleaner fuels, but persistently low fossil
fuel prices have discouraged serious development and marketing efforts. 
Awareness is growing among authorities and consumers of the financial and
health costs associated with high dependence on motor vehicles and urban
congestion but, to date, there has been little movement towards strong
financial mechanisms and/or economic incentives to encourage alternative
means of transportation.  Regulation, however, is being tightened in most
developed countries and increasingly stringent controls on vehicle
emissions are being introduced, notably in Scandinavia, the European Union
and the United States of America.


                                  2.  Land

59.  Land management involves a range of interrelated issues, including
land-use planning and employment, habitat preservation, the maintenance of
environmental services such as flood control and the quality of soils and
their fitness for agricultural production.  As competition for land
increases, trade-offs between alternative uses and functions of available
land will become more critical in economic, social and environmental
decision-making.

60.  The recognition of the need for an integrated approach to land-use
management has increased and was stressed by the Commission on Sustainable
Development at its third session.  Developed countries have made some
progress towards integrating agricultural and environmental policies,
delinking agricultural support from production incentives and promoting
sustainable agricultural practices.  However, there is still a lack of
comprehensive rural policies that bring together production, environmental
and rural welfare objectives.  Land resource planning and management,
especially at the implementation phase, are complex tasks requiring the
participation of different national-level ministries as well as regional
and local authorities and the private sector.  More progress is required to
develop institutional arrangements which facilitate joint public-private
activities and improve transparency of land management.

61.  There is growing recognition of the need for greater involvement of
all stakeholders concerned in land-use management decisions and a useful
body of experience with participation programmes, especially in developing
countries, is now being built up by non-governmental organizations,
development agencies and Governments.  Many practical programmes relating
to programme design and implementation have been initiated or expanded
since UNCED and a number of countries have made greater efforts to provide
the means for people to express their views on land-use decisions.  This
process is aided by land resources and development information systems,
which have developed rapidly in recent years.  Geographical Information
Systems are being established in both developed and developing countries,
sometimes at the village level.

62.  In developing countries, there is a continuing dilemma over
production/
income and environmental goals.  The strategy of sustainably intensifying
already converted land of greatest production potential - in order to
reduce pressure for expansion into marginal lands - is beginning to be more
widely accepted and introduced.  Nevertheless, the importance of non-farm,
rural industry promoting policies for employment, especially for areas of
lower agricultural potential, are generally not well reflected in rural
development and environment strategies.

63.  Understanding of the extent and severity of degradation of productive
land has been improved by the survey conducted by the International Soil
Reference and Information Centre (the GLASOD survey).  Following calls for
action at UNCED, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in
Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,
particularly in Africa 9/ was opened for signature in October 1994 and
entered into force in December 1996.  Implementing actions to improve soil
management require a complex of measures involving, according to national
circumstances, rationalization of a secure land tenure system, improving
farmer education through information and extension programmes, upgrading
technology and providing an enabling socio-economic framework which
encourages producers to manage their land sustainably.

64.  The threat posed to long-term food security by soil degradation was
also emphasized at the World Food Summit of November 1996.  The Rome
Declaration on World Food Security adopted at the Summit states that
increased food production must be undertaken within the framework of
sustainable management of natural resources and acknowledges the importance
for food security of sustainable agricultural practices, fisheries,
forestry and rural development.  The World Food Summit Plan of Action calls
for an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with a minimum
target of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015.

65.  Land-use conflicts between agriculture, forest cover and urban uses
are sharpening, especially in moist tropical areas suitable for the
expansion of human activity.  The UNCED statement of Forest Principles has
helped to encourage global approaches to forest management.  The
International Tropical Timber Agreement was renegotiated in 1993.  A large
number of international meetings of experts, many co-sponsored by
developing and developed countries, have greatly enriched the understanding
of sustainable forest management and of approaches to its implementation. 
In a major step forward, the Commission on Sustainable Development
established the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests with a two-year
mandate to generate consensus and propose actions for implementation of the
Forest Principles and other forest-related recommendations of UNCED.  The
Panel will submit its report to the Commission at its present session. 
Without pre-empting the outcome of the Panel, it can be said that notable
progress has been made towards international consensus on basic principles
and operational guidelines for national forest programmes, forest
assessment and criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management.


                               3.  Freshwater

66.  The recently completed Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater
Resources of the World has provided new insights into the current status of
freshwater availability.  It has made clear the intimate relationship
between water quantity (supply) and quality and the risks of poor water
management.  In many developing countries, water scarcity, exacerbated by
growing pollution from industry, agriculture and human settlements,
constitutes perhaps the most significant threat to socio-economic
development and human health.

67.  Some progress has been made in developing an integrated approach to
water use and more rational and equitable allocation of water among various
users.  This approach is sometimes characterized by management at the level
of river basins or watershed areas and by the participation of users and
local communities in the decision-making process, including decisions
related to financing of infrastructure.  The role of women in water
resources management is being increasingly recognized at the national and
local levels.

68.  Two of the most important success stories in relation to water quality
include the development, application and monitoring of drinking water
quality guidelines and progress in the eradication of guinea-worm
infection.  Efforts to improve public water supplies have been ongoing
since UNCED and data received from national laboratories indicate that
capacities for monitoring water quality are gradually improving.  However,
water infrastructure in many countries remains wholly inadequate to monitor
and control pollution and to protect human health, and current levels of
investment do not appear adequate to remedy the situation.

69.  A major impediment to the implementation of Agenda 21 objectives
remains the fragmentation of responsibilities and mandates for water
resources management at the national level and the lack of attention that
water receives in comparison with other sectors.  The significant economic
and social costs associated with poor water quality and inappropriate
allocation have yet to be fully realized in decision-making.  The lack of
financial and human resources also continues to be a major constraint in
the improvement of water management capabilities, particularly in
developing countries.

70.  However, a promising approach is being developed under the Global
Water Partnership, an international mechanism which aims to translate the
consensus on water management into responsive, coherent services to
developing countries, with the emphasis on local implementation.  The
Partnership will support integrated water resources management programmes
by collaborating with Governments and existing networks, developing new
arrangements, and encouraging all stakeholders to adopt consistent policies
and programmes and to share information and experience.


                             4.  Oceans and seas

71.  Considerable progress has been made in recent intergovernmental
negotiations related to oceans and seas.  The 1982 United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which entered into force in 1994, and the
Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the Conservation and
Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 10/
which will enter into force after ratification by 30 countries, represent
major contributions to the goal of long-term conservation and sustainable
use of fish stocks.

72.  The adoption, since UNCED, of the Global Programme of Action for the
Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities
(Washington, D.C., 1995)11/ is another important step towards more
integrated management of the world's oceans.  The proposals for
institutional arrangements for the implementation of the Global Programme
of Action are currently being reviewed by Governments.  They provide a
broad framework for cooperation among various United Nations and non-United
Nations entities, in particular in the establishment of a clearing-house
mechanism and an assessment of the state of oceans and coastal areas.  The
Global Programme of Action thus complements the Convention on the
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter of 1972
(London Dumping Convention), amended in November 1996.

73.  International management of fisheries, strengthened by the entry into
force of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, has improved
further with the adoption of General Assembly resolution 46/215, in which
the Assembly called for a global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic
drift-net fishing on the high seas and with the 1995 agreement reached by
the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly
Migratory Fish Stocks. 10/  These processes, together with the requirements
of Agenda 21 for fisheries, were consolidated in the FAO voluntary Code of
Conduct for Responsible Fisheries adopted in 1995.  Dependence on
aquaculture (mainly inland) for an important part of future net increases
in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater
resources, protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban
pollution, as well as protection of coastal areas, wetlands and mangrove
swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices.  The need to limit
access to marine fishery resources and to establish forms of property and
use rights to manage a gradual return to sustainable levels of harvest is
gaining recognition, and some countries have begun using individual
transferable quotas (ITQs).  The International Coral Reef Initiative has
addressed the importance of these vulnerable ecosystems and concrete steps
are being taken towards implementation.

74.  Institutional arrangements for ocean management remain fragmented,
however, with problematic divisions of responsibility between areas under
national jurisdiction and international waters.  It is also evident that,
while important agreements have been concluded at the global level,
implementation will be better addressed at the regional level, where the
management mandate and capacity of existing organizations needs
strengthening.  Approximately 80 per cent of marine pollution still stems
directly from human activity on land.  Protection of the economic and
ecological value of coastal ecosystems, as well as of human health, will
not be possible without the effective control of pollution from rivers and
lakes, and treatment of wastewater from cities which currently drain their
urban and industrial wastes directly into coastal systems.


                              5.  Biodiversity

75.  The Convention on Biological Diversity, 6/ which entered into force in
December 1993, has been signed by 163 States and one regional economic
integration organization so far.  A Subsidiary Body on Scientific,
Technical and Technological Advice, as called for in the Convention, has
been established.  A clearing-house mechanism has been established and is
in its pilot phase.  It is accessible to all countries and will support
implementation of the Convention at the national level.  National
strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity are under preparation in many countries.

76.  At the second meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention, in 1995, UNEP released the Global Biodiversity Assessment which
furthered consensus on current trends in biodiversity, means of approaching
the problem and possible solutions.  In its contribution to the special
session of the General Assembly, the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention noted that, in spite of the progress made in implementing the
objectives of the Convention, Parties remain aware that biological
diversity is being destroyed by human activities at unprecedented rates. 
Despite progress since UNCED, knowledge of biodiversity remains very
limited.

77.  A Global Strategy for Management of Farm Animal Genetic Resources has
been launched with a mission to document existing animal genetic resources,
develop and improve their utility to achieve food security, maintain those
that represent unique genetic material and that are threatened, and
facilitate access to animal genetic resources important to food and
agriculture.  At its third meeting, in 1996, the Conference of the Parties
to the Convention decided to establish a multi-year programme of activities
on agricultural biodiversity aiming, inter alia, at promoting the positive
and mitigating the negative effects of agricultural practices on
agricultural biodiversity.

78.  Work on biosafety has progressed.  UNEP issued technical guidelines on
biosafety, and under the Convention a Working Group has been established to
develop a protocol on biosafety.  The International Council of Scientific
Unions (ICSU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) have recently launched an international scientific
programme on biodiversity, entitled Diversitas.  The Jakarta Mandate,
adopted at the second meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention, provides a framework for actin on marine and coastal biological
diversity.  A framework for global action which promotes support for and
cooperation with other international bodies was also adopted at the second
meeting.  At its third meeting, the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention elaborated further on actions to be undertaken to advance the
implementation of the Convention.  It highlighted, among other things,
agro-biodiversity, forests and inland water ecosystems.


          F.  Addressing the risks related to wastes and hazardous
              materials                                           

79.  The International Conference on Chemical Safety was organized by the
International Programme on Chemical Safety and convened in Stockholm in
April 1994.  The Conference, which was attended by 110 countries,
10 international organizations and 27 non-governmental organizations,
established the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety, which is
mandated to seek consensus among Governments on the development of
strategies for the implementation of chapter 19 of Agenda 21 and to
undertake periodic reviews of these strategies.  The second meeting of the
Forum will take place at Ottawa in February 1997.

80.  A number of international organizations, namely, FAO, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the International Labour
Organization (ILO) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of OECD, the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO)
have jointly developed and recommended for the use by Governments and
industry the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against
Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radioactive Sources.  Likewise,
revised Regulations for the Safe Transportation of Radioactive Material
have been set by IAEA.

81.  In the field of prior informed consent (PIC), UNEP and FAO are jointly
implementing the PIC procedure and negotiations are well under way towards
a PIC convention.  Two meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee were held in 1996 and a diplomatic conference is expected to be
held in 1997.  The number of countries participating in the voluntary
procedure has increased to 148, with 17 chemicals subject to the procedure.


                   G.  Role of Government and major groups

82.  Agenda 21 makes clear that sustainable development cannot be delivered
by Governments alone.  It stresses the role of the private sector and other
groups in civil society, which have a prominent place in Agenda 21. 
Experience since 1992 has reinforced the need for such an approach. 
Globalization affects, and sometimes reduces, the ability of Governments to
achieve desired outcomes.  While Governments continue to provide the
overall framework in which the private sector must operate, many important
decisions are made by the private sector, especially by companies operating
in an international context.  Governments also have to ensure the provision
of such basic social services as education and health care, at a time of
increasing budget constraints.  Practice has shown that detailed
prescriptive regulation of the productive sectors is becoming less
feasible, less appropriate and less effective.  While globalization will
have to find a response in new forms of international decision-making,
effective implementation of international and national policies requires
decentralized and participatory decision-making processes.


                               1.  Governments

83.  Close to 150 countries have established national-level commissions or
coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to
sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society
sectors in the process of agenda setting and strategy building.  More than
90 per cent of them have been established in response to UNCED, the
majority in developing countries.  In some countries, the national councils
of sustainable development have been more political than substantive in
nature.  They tend to generate broad commitments with limited follow-up at
the working level, where sectoral plans and strategies remain largely
unaffected.

84.  Some of the most promising developments have taken place at the level
of cities and municipalities, where local Agenda 21 initiatives have
predominated.  These have been grass-roots expressions of concern and
involvement rather than top-down planning exercises.  In many cases local
authorities have been reluctant to link their efforts to national action
plans for fear that the agenda will then be imposed on them from above
rather than flowing from local needs.  A wide variety of successful cases
have been reported in the past four years on these initiatives.  The United
Nations Centre for Human Settlements, as part of its preparations for
Habitat II, developed, in cooperation with other partners, an extensive
database of best practices related to sustainable development at the local
level, which is now available on the Internet.  Local-level strategies and
plans have proved far more successful than those at the national level in
terms of making a direct impact.


                               2.  Parliaments

85.  Parliaments in many countries have been actively involved in
implementation of the commitments made at UNCED.  Information thereon has
been reported annually to the Commission on Sustainable Development by the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), based on the outcome of an annual survey. 
IPU also adopted declarations relevant to sustainable development, for
example, on finance and technology transfer and on conservation of world
fish stocks.


                       3.  International organizations

86.  International cooperation can facilitate the transition towards
sustainable development worldwide and support relevant action at the
national level.  This, together with the growing commitment of
intergovernmental organizations and international institutions to the
sustainable development agenda, has shown that the United Nations system,
in partnership with other international bodies, can, in spite of a number
of constraints, add significant value to the implementation of Agenda 21.

87.  New forms of cooperation have also emerged at the regional level. 
They include cooperation between the United Nations regional commissions
and representatives of global United Nations agencies and programmes at the
regional level.  A number of intergovernmental meetings have adopted
political statements and action plans for sustainable development.  They
have been convened in association with both United Nations regional
commissions and other regional organizations such as the Organization of
American States (OAS), the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the South
Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  A new commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna
Commission (IOTC), has been established under FAO for the management of
tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean.  High profile ministerial conferences
have played an important agenda-setting role and have helped to raise
public and political awareness.

88.  Regional economic arrangements have rapidly expanded to new countries
and new policy areas and have continued to develop after the completion of
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.  For example, the
three States members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
entered into a parallel agreement and established a Commission on
Environmental Cooperation to implement it.  This framework provides for
citizen involvement in monitoring compliance with national environmental
laws and regulations.


                           4.  The private sector

89.  Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business
initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective, with notable
progress in the areas of joint industry/government partnerships and the
development of innovative policy instruments, environmentally efficient
technologies and products, and broader sustainability concerns regarding
the relation of business and the wider community.

90.  Considerations of cost-efficiency and effectiveness are encouraging
Governments to supplement traditional regulatory approaches with a broader
policy package including economic instruments and other strategies based on
"Partnerships" between the private and public sectors.  These instruments,
which include environmental taxes and charges, environmental subsidies,
environmental funds, negotiable emissions instruments, environmental
performance bonds and voluntary agreements, are in use at some level in all
regions of the world by both developed and developing country Governments.

91.  Business and industry organizations are responding with the
development and implementation of an increasing number of voluntary codes
of conduct and environmental management systems which help firms to meet
environmental performance standards without the need for detailed
regulation.  Environmental Management Systems (EMS) standards such as the
ISO 14000 series and the European Union's Environmental Management and
Audit Scheme (EMAS) and other national standards (such as the United
Kingdom BS 7750) have contributed greatly to industry's adoption of
environmental management and to the ability of Governments to match
environmental legislation to industrial improvements in this area.  The
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), UNEP, the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), UNCTAD and others are
assisting countries, especially developing countries, in building the
capacity necessary to comply with these new standards, so that they can,
inter alia, maintain or enhance their export opportunities.

92.  Many larger companies have now moved beyond "end-of-pipe" pollution
control to a more integrated cleaner production and life-cycle approach
aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of the goods and services they
provide.  However, examples on the market are still limited to a relatively
small number of product categories, notably recycled paper and tissue
products, solvent-free paints and varnishes, cosmetics and more recyclable
packaging.  The concept of "eco-efficiency" (the production of goods and
services with reduced throughput of energy and materials) is being actively
promoted by organizations such as the World Business Council on Sustainable
Development and is attracting growing interest from companies with the
resources to implement technical and managerial change.  However, limited
progress has been achieved in addressing small and medium-sized
enterprises.  In both developed and developing countries they are in need
of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed
by national and international environmental regulations, standards and
voluntary codes that are developed by large companies.


                           5.  Other major groups

93.  The action-oriented participation of organized major groups has been
particularly dynamic.  They increasingly interact directly with national
Governments and international organizations, including Convention
secretariats and processes.  Major group representatives have been active
partners in promoting sustainable development among their members and the
wider community.  Trade unions are bringing sustainable development into
the workplace.  The scientific and technological communities play a vital
role in diagnosing problems and developing response options.  Local
authorities, by virtue of the geographical focus of their activities, are
an increasingly important component of the consultative process regarding
local problems and solutions.

94.  Youth have been active in promoting sustainable development as vital
to their future, though they are still insufficiently included in decision-
making at the national and local levels and lack information.  Indigenous
peoples and farmers are increasingly concerned about the impact of
biodiversity and biotechnology issues on traditional values and property
rights.  Indigenous peoples have become active participants at the
intergovernmental level in the context of the Convention on Biological
Diversity and the need for protection of genetic resources.  Following
UNCED, the rights and roles of women in sustainable development have been
further emphasized in other global conferences, particularly the Fourth
World Conference on Women and the International Conference on Population
and Development, and the need to empower women in this regard has been
recognized.  The rights and role of women are issues that have appeared in
all the post-UNCED conferences.

95.  Non-governmental organizations are very active in developing and
implementing actions for sustainable development at the local and national
levels.  They increasingly act as implementing partners with national
Governments and bilateral and multilateral aid organizations. 
Non-governmental organizations do not always receive adequate financial
support from national institutions and they do not have adequate access to
international bodies.  The role of non-governmental organizations needs to
be enhanced if their full potential in helping to achieve sustainability is
to be realized.

96.  Despite many positive developments, the implementation of specific
objectives in the major group chapters of Agenda 21 has not always achieved
the level desired.  For example, gender balance in decision-making has
still not been achieved and national instruments to this effect are not
being enforced.  The situation of indigenous people continues to be a
serious concern, with insufficient action being taken at the national
level.


                         H.  Means of implementation

97.  A major strength of Agenda 21 lay in its identification of means of
implementation with relevance to different economic sectoral activities. 
Approaches to policy implementation currently under development in these
areas are key to building integrative strategies and instruments for
sustainable development.


                    1.  Financing sustainable development

98.  Average ODA for the period 1993-1995 was lower than for the period
1990-1992, both in absolute value and as a percentage of GNP, and was the
lowest it had been for 30 years.  Only four countries achieved the goal of
0.7 per cent of GNP.  These were Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and
Sweden.  The decrease in ODA has been particularly critical for the poorest
countries that have little access to other sources of external finance and
private investment.  It greatly limits the ability of Governments in most
developing countries to undertake the social and environmental investments
that do not otherwise attract private investments.  Funds provided under
the concessional lending arm of the World Bank, the International
Development Association (IDA), have been replenished, indicating continued
donor commitment to multilateral cooperation on poverty reduction, economic
adjustment and growth and environmental sustainability, though resources
are still not considered large enough.  Clearly, the decline in ODA is not
consistent with the expectations raised by UNCED, despite the efforts to
find new and additional sources of internal finance through alternative
mechanisms.

99.  In the years since UNCED, the Bretton Woods institutions have
increased their commitment to sustainable development, which has helped the
provision of resources to poor developing countries for environmentally
sound economic and social development.  The interest of the World Bank in
the environmental and social impacts of its projects in developing
countries has grown substantially.  From marginal concern for environmental
issues before UNCED, the Bank's loan portfolio for environmental projects
reached US$ 12 billion in 1996 and it has begun to undertake environmental
and social assessments of Bank-financed projects.

100. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was launched as a pilot
programme in 1991 to assist developing countries and countries with
economies in transition in pursuit of global benefits in the four focal
areas of biodiversity, climate change, international waters, and ozone
layer depletion.  During the pilot phase, an estimated US$ 730 million was
allocated to fund a work programme of 115 global, regional and country
projects.  In March 1994, an agreement was reached on restructuring and
replenishing the Facility as a major source for global environment funding. 
However, the formulation of proposals and modalities for implementing the
projects to be funded by the Facility has often been time-consuming and
complicated.  Although much work has gone into the preparation of
guidelines and proposals, there is room for further improvement in the
disbursement of funds in support of GEF projects. 

101. The most notable progress in financing sustainable development since
UNCED has been the increase in private capital flows to developing
countries.  The average annual private capital flow to developing countries
from OECD countries in the two-year period from 1993 to 1994 was US$ 102
billion or about 60 per cent of total flows from OECD to developing
countries.  More importantly, about 42 per cent of all private flows from
OECD to developing countries in the same period were foreign direct
investments, the type of investment that is more stable and reliable in the
long term.

102. Despite the increase of private capital flows to middle-level
developing countries, the poorest countries have not obtained the necessary
flows of private capital and their ratio of foreign direct investment to
GNP still remains about half that of the middle-income developing
countries.
     
103. The debt-to-export ratio, the main indicator of an economy's ability
to repay its debt, of many developing countries has substantially improved
since 1992.  The debt problems of the 1980s of most middle-income
developing countries have been alleviated through a combination of sound
economic policies, liberalization of international trade and capital
movements, rescheduling of bilateral external debt and the introduction of
new instruments such as Brady-type and debt conversion programmes (of which
debt-equity swaps have been the most successful, particularly in Latin
America until 1994).

104. However, the debt burden of heavily indebted low-income countries has
increased during the past decade, which has hampered their development
potential.  The initiative taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank in April 1996 to design a comprehensive external debt
alleviation package targeting these countries is especially welcome.


                         2.  Transferring technology

105. Many goals of Agenda 21 depend for their achievement on the
introduction of cleaner and more efficient technologies (environmentally
sound technologies (ESTs)).  The Commission on Sustainable Development, at
its third session, adopted a work programme which focuses on access to and
dissemination of information, capacity-building for managing technological
change and financial and partnership arrangements.  Since UNCED, workshops
and studies have been conducted and information and awareness-raising
campaigns initiated at the national, regional and international levels. 
They are intended to stimulate the demand for ESTs and thus promote their
transfer.  A number of developed and developing countries and economies in
transition have adopted policies and implemented programmes which support a
gradual shift in use from "end-of-pipe" (or clean-up) technologies and
equipment to integrated technological solutions in production processes and
products.  National cleaner production centres that can facilitate the
transition towards cleaner production have been established in nine
countries with the support of UNIDO and UNEP.

106. Although no concrete data are available, there is overall recognition
that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public
and private sources in developed countries directed towards developing
countries has not, in general, been realized as envisaged at UNCED. 
Increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology
in some developing countries and economies in transition.  However, many
developing countries have been left behind, which has slowed the process of
technological change in these countries.  
107. More information is needed from both national and local governments
and the private sector regarding the effectiveness of policies to
facilitate and accelerate technology transfer and technological diffusion. 
Such information could provide greater insights into (a) the relationship
between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and
technical innovation; (b) the effectiveness of company strategies for
adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for
production processes which are environmentally responsible and competitive;
and (c) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology
markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to
developing countries.


                            3.  Building capacity

108. The emphasis in Agenda 21 on more participatory approaches to
sustainable development has influenced a new generation of capacity-
building projects that has come on line since 1992.  Most activities aimed
at environmental management and sustainable development now make explicit
efforts at stakeholder and beneficiary assessment.  For example, the
Capacity 21 programme established by UNDP after UNCED has proved to be an
effective catalyst and learning mechanism to support capacity-building for
sustainable development.  As of May 1996, total contributions to Capacity
21, through both its trust fund and other mechanisms, stood at around US$
57 million.  Since 1993, the programme has helped to fund projects in over
40 countries.

109. Much progress has been made in the areas of strategy formulation,
greater participation and information exchange.  What has been lacking are
the structures and capacities to carry out many of the technical functions
associated with sustainable development.  Putting such technical,
scientific and institutional structures in place represents the long-term
work facing many countries.  The lack of co-financing from bilateral donors
has slowed their ability to work on the larger multi-component capacity-
building programmes.


                     4.  Information for decision-making

110. Good quality information and data are crucial in identifying the
nature and scale of problems but progress in collecting, organizing and
presenting information in usable form has been mixed.  The quality of
information at the international level, in terms of data collection and
development of indicators, has improved considerably since UNCED.  National
and local level information, and facilities for the exchange of such
information, need to be further developed and improved.

111. Many of the data areas identified in Agenda 21, including urban air,
freshwater, desertification, biodiversity, high seas and upper atmosphere,
demographic factors, urbanization, poverty, health, rights of access to
resources, and information on various major groups, have been inventoried
at the international and regional levels.  Considerable progress has been
made in filling gaps, through initiatives of the United Nations system,
other intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations. 
To address the lack of critical long-term data necessary to understand
global ecosystem problems, international organizations and the scientific
community have designed observing systems to make data collection more
coherent and cost-effective.  Important mechanisms for observation,
monitoring, assessment and exchange have been put in place to assess the
state of planetary systems and enhance information flow.  These include the
Global Terrestrial Observing System (G-TOS), the Global Climate Observing
System (G-COS) and the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).  Notable
innovations since UNCED include the World Hydrological Cycle Observing
System (WHYCOS), the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the Mountain
Forum and the Global Modelling Forum.  Important work is being carried out,
in particular under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical
Safety (IFCS), on the development of information on chemical safety.

112. Since UNCED, much new work has been initiated on indicators for
sustainable development.  The Commission on Sustainable Development, for
its part, launched a global process to draw upon these initiatives and make
use of their collective expertise and knowledge to reach consensus on the
technical validity, comparability and political acceptability of
indicators.  The Commission approved a programme of work which has led to
the development of a preliminary core set of indicators of sustainable
development, followed by the preparation of methodology sheets for each of
the indicators.  The aim is to have an agreed set of indicators available
for use at the national level by the year 2000.

113. At the same time, work is progressing in various sectors to develop
more detailed sectoral indicators to measure performance under
international agreements, and in the scientific community to integrate the
economic, social, environmental and institutional dimensions in more
aggregated indicators, which take account of interlinkages.  In this
regard, a particularly fruitful approach to integrating the components of
sustainable development in an operational framework is to think in terms of
flows of investment which maintain or increase society's stock of
environmental assets (natural capital), physical capital (the built
environment), human capital and social capital.  While limited substitution
is possible among these different categories of assets, they are for the
most part complementary.  The challenge of sustainable development is thus
to build up all kinds of wealth into a people-enriching and nature-
preserving system.

114. Less, though significant, progress has been made at the national and
subnational levels.  A growing number of countries have completed national
inventories and organized the collection of needed data.  Several factors
account for this trend, including the rapid growth of national and
subnational sustainable development strategies, plans and targets; adoption
of national and local indicators; ratification of relevant international
treaties; and, in some cases, support from the international community for
the requisite capacity-building for these activities.

115. The work that has begun on streamlining national reporting in the
field of sustainable development is of considerable importance and should
be continued.  Emphasis should be placed both on establishing a multi-year
work programme that focuses, inter alia, on a calendar of reporting to
assist national planning and on information-sharing among United Nations
system organizations through electronic means to the extent possible.

116. Overall, great strides have been made in the availability of
information independently of Agenda 21, as a result of rapid and
revolutionary technological changes in computing, telecommunications and
geographical information system technologies.  However, far too little has
been done to make national telecommunications systems responsive to the
growing demand for electronic information.  This is especially the case in
some developing countries, where the lack of adequate infrastructure and
telephone systems is hindering access to the new electronic networks.


                    III.  CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES AHEAD

117. The previous sections lead towards a number of general conclusions
that should be taken into account when defining priorities for future
international action towards sustainable development.  Progress is evident
in the many plans and strategies which have been developed at every level
of operation.  Strategies are the first step in the policy cycle which must
then advance to politically difficult decisions on priorities and budget
allocation, implementing actions and review.

118. Much remains to be done to ensure that sustainable development is
understood by decision makers as well as by the public.  Accordingly, there
is a need for adequate communication strategies at the international and
country levels to ensure that this understanding is achieved.

119. The four years of implementation of Agenda 21 have underlined the
crucial importance of an integrated approach to sustainable development,
involving all actors in a participatory process.

     Sustainable development strategies are important mechanisms to enhance
     and link national capacity, bringing together the priorities in
     social, economic and environmental policies involving participation of
     all concerned parties.

     Capacity-building activities should give priority to their development
     and implementation.

     Such strategies should also extend to the various levels of
     government.
     
     Effective planning and implementation of sustainable development
     policies requires the participation of all social groups. 
     Responsibility for managing resources, particularly at the local
     level, are often divided between women and men and between different
     socio-economic groups.  Each group has specific knowledge and skills
     that should be integrated in the planning process, and participation
     in the policy-making process will encourage broad commitment to, and
     implementation of, sustainable development policies.

120. Eradication of poverty throughout the world is a priority element of
sustainable development, as stated in Agenda 21 and further elaborated in
the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development. 12/

     For people living in poverty, and for countries with a high incidence
     of poverty, the eradication of poverty must be a high priority, both
     as an end in itself and to promote sustainable use of natural
     resources.  The commitments of the international community to support
     the efforts of developing countries must be reaffirmed and
     implemented.

121. Substantive progress has been achieved in further developing and
adopting international consensus on the sustainable management of natural
resources in the form of international agreements.

     The focus of international discussions, including those taking place
     under the Rio Conventions (on climate change, 8/  biodiversity 6/ and
     desertification 9/), has moved from policy development to
     implementation.  This holds true for the atmosphere, oceans, land
     management and biodiversity.

122. However, further policy development at the global level as guidance
for implementation is needed in some areas.

     The Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests is likely to leave
     certain areas of sustainable forest management unresolved.  Evidence
     provided by the Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater Resources
     of the World sheds new light on the urgency of the freshwater
     situation in the world, which requires a consolidated policy response.

     Scientific evidence on the negative impacts on health and ecosystems
     of certain chemicals, especially POPs, is such that the need for an
     international agreement on their phase-out is urgent.

123. In certain areas there is a need to improve policy coordination and
implementation at the regional level.

     Some issues, such as regional seas, certain aspects of climate change,
     transboundary conservation of biodiversity, transboundary
     environmental impacts, land degradation and transboundary movements of
     hazardous wastes, are among those which can be best tackled at the
     regional level. 

124. The need for an integrated approach in the management of each of the
natural resources is one of the important lessons from UNCED and its
follow-up.  In some areas, for example, oceans, a number of agreements have
come into being that are not necessarily interlinked.  Follow-up
discussions must ensure improved integration.

125. More can be done to make the implementation of the three Rio
Conventions (on climate change, biodiversity and desertification) mutually
reinforcing, by addressing substantive linkages and identifying projects
that achieve the objectives of more than one Convention.

126. To facilitate effective implementation, consideration of resource
management issues must be combined with an equal emphasis on sectoral
policy development. 

     Economic sectors (agriculture, fisheries, forestry, industry, human
     settlements, energy, transport, social services) must be involved in
     international discussions on implementation and held responsible for
     their contribution to problems and solutions.  In this context, due
     attention should be given to such issues as health, sound management
     of wastes and chemical safety, among others.

127. Urgent action is required to slow, and where feasible, reverse the
degradation of agricultural land.  Improved management and restoration of
irrigated land, and improved land-use planning to reduce unnecessary losses
of productive land to development, are priorities.

     Future food supplies will come in large part from intensification of
     agriculture, that is, increased yields from existing lands.  Soil
     degradation and loss of productive lands reduce the potential for
     future gains and increase the technological, social and financial
     challenges of raising production.

128. The integration of health impact assessments into economic sectoral
planning and in sustainable development plans needs priority attention.

129. Major gaps in international discussion of economic sectors exist,
namely in the fields of energy, transport and tourism. 

     Energy is arguably the most critical link between environment and
     development, but the tensions between the legitimate energy needs of
     developing countries for socio-economic development and the
     consequences of expanded use of fossil fuels for human health and
     local, regional and global pollution have been inadequately addressed. 
     This oversight has to some extent been redressed in the negotiations
     on climate change, but it remains an area that requires more focused
     analysis and action, not just in terms of new and renewable forms of
     energy, but the more basic issue of how developing countries, in
     particular, can acquire the levels of energy supply needed for their
     development while reducing dependence on carbon-based fuels.

     In transport, improvements in efficiency in fuel and material use are
     largely outweighed by the growth of the sector.

     Tourism is the fastest growing economic sector, with major social and
     environmental impacts.

130. The discussion on changing consumption and production patterns must
move from a rather abstract level, for example, by providing a strategic
approach and concrete measures to be taken by the economic sectors.  The
impact of changing consumption and production patterns in industrialized
countries on the export opportunities of developing countries must be kept
under permanent review.

131. The need for international discussions on making the objectives of
trade liberalization and sustainable development mutually supportive is
undisputed.  This should be coupled with enhanced discussion and
coordination at the national level.

     The focus of the debate could shift from narrowly defined trade and
     environment issues to an integrated consideration of all factors
     relevant for achieving sustainable development, with an emphasis on
     synergies rather than on restrictions.  The debate should be supported
     by improved empirical analysis.  Identification and effective
     implementation of positive measures deserve priority attention.
 
132. Broad participation has been essential for achieving progress in
policy development and implementation of sustainable development.  Further
consideration must be given to new forms of governance that reflect the
increased responsibility and accountability of major groups.

     The role of the private sector is ever increasing.  Major resource
     flows from the developed to the developing countries and economies in
     transition take place through the private sector.  Although private
     capital has the potential to finance sustainable development, so far
     it has typically avoided projects whose main purpose is to generate
     environmental and social benefits.  However, developing countries
     offer investment opportunities that generate social and environmental
     gains and could also be profitable if they ensure a more efficient
     provision of goods and services for which users are willing to pay
     (win-win opportunities).  Furthermore, involvement of the private
     sector (industry and the private financial sector) in the
     international policy discussions on sustainable development is needed.

133. Public international financial resources for the implementation of
sustainable development in developing countries have not met the
commitments made by the donor countries at UNCED.

     Reconfirmation of the commitments made at UNCED and specific
     commitments for support to those areas that are closely linked to the
     fulfilment of basic needs and where coordinated programmes have been
     developed by the international community (e.g., in the field of water,
     energy and forests) are needed to maintain the credibility of
     partnerships between developed and developing countries. 

     The scarcity of funds to finance sustainable development is
     particularly acute for low-income developing countries.  This is
     because they attract little external private capital, receive
     decreasing amounts of ODA, and many of them have heavy external debt
     burdens.  The 1990s have witnessed growing gaps between least
     developed countries and other developing countries with regard to GNP
     and per capita income growth rates, and many other indicators of human
     development.

     It would appear that developing countries that have embraced sound,
     stable and outward-oriented macroeconomic and trade policies during
     the 1990s (such as those adopted by many middle-income Latin American
     and Asian countries) do attract private capital and have easier access
     to external debt alleviation programmes.  However, these policies
     require costly political, economic and administrative reforms. 
     Because ODA is an important source of finance for these reforms,
     especially in the least developed countries, donor countries should
     intensify efforts to meet the UNCED target on ODA.

134. Limited progress has been made with the implementation of economic
instruments to internalize environmental costs in goods and services.

     Active exchange of information on the successful use of economic
     instruments may be conducive to their further introduction.

135. Technology partnerships and cooperative arrangements are needed to
stimulate practical cooperation between Governments and industry at both
the national and international levels.

     More information is needed from both Governments and the private
     sector regarding the effectiveness of policies to facilitate and
     accelerate technology transfer and technological diffusion.

136. The information base for decision-making on sustainable development is
still uneven and access to existing information systems must be
strengthened.

     There is a need to improve capabilities for data acquisition from
     large areas of the world on a scale necessary to monitor the
     environment properly.  Many of the environmental problems, such as
     climate change, desertification and the extinction of living species,
     unfold over long timescales.  The need for data and processed
     information with adequate temporal and spatial resolution is still
     significant.

137. Consolidated scientific evidence is essential for international policy
development.

     There is a need for further scientific cooperation, especially across
     academic disciplines, in order to verify and strengthen scientific
     evidence for environmental change.  Some examples of cooperation
     already exist, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
     and work carried out by the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical
     Safety.

     Education for all needs to be assured as another crucial factor
     associated with policy development.  The concerns of sustainable
     development, global interdependence and peace must be fully integrated
     in formal and non-formal education and public awareness-raising.

138. A gender perspective should be applied in all aspects of the
implementation of Agenda 21.

     This is essential in order to assess the actual and potential
     contribution of women and men to formulating and implementing relevant
     policies and programmes, as well as to adequately assess the impacts
     of economic and social conditions and of environmental degradation on
     the population as a whole.  The need for gender-disaggregated data is
     a priority in facilitating gender-sensitive analysis and policy-
     making.


       IV.  INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION ON
            SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AFTER 1997                       

                         A.  Institutional framework

139. The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the
United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should
continue to provide an "overarching" policy framework for the entire
spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic, social and
environmental fields at the global, regional and national levels.  All
intergovernmental and inter-agency bodies and processes should contribute,
within their mandates and areas of competence, to further progress in
achieving the goals of sustainable development through concrete action and
decision-making.  Full account must also be taken of the overall framework
for cooperation agreed by the international community in the context of the
coordinated follow-up to all recent United Nations conferences, since all
have made an important contribution to specific aspects of the global
sustainable development agenda.

140. The overall institutional framework for the implementation of Agenda
21, as outlined in chapter 38, would seem to be fully relevant for the
period after the 1997 review.  However, the General Assembly at its special
session may wish to consider how this framework could best be deployed in
the future.  More specific suggestions on this matter are contained in
document E/CN.17/1997/2/Add.28.  At the same time, bearing in mind the
specific request contained in paragraph 13 (d) of General Assembly
resolution 50/113, the present report includes recommendations on the
future role of the Commission on Sustainable Development in the follow-up
to the special session, which are outlined below.


           B.  Programme of work of the Commission on Sustainable
               Development                                       

141. The first multi-year programme of work of the Commission on
Sustainable Development was organized in a way that allowed for in-depth
consideration of all the individual chapters of Agenda 21 over the period
of three years.  Such an approach was appropriate for the first review
cycle.  It provided an effective opportunity for the Commission to carry
out an initial analysis of institutional and policy changes and activities
at the international, national and "major group" levels to implement all
chapters of Agenda 21, adopt specific recommendation to operationalize
specific recommendations of UNCED and provide a forum for exchanges of
relevant experiences.

142. However, some disadvantages have become apparent.  Annual sessions of
the Commission have been overloaded with issues and reports.  Additionally,
separate consideration of individual chapters of Agenda 21 has not always
allowed the Commission to examine linkages between various sectoral and
cross-sectoral issues addressed in Agenda 21, and interrelationships among
various economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable
development have not always been addressed adequately.  The impression has
sometimes been created that there is some duplication of work between the
Commission and other intergovernmental bodies or processes.  At the same
time, the annual, generic policy discussion of some issues (e.g., the role
of major groups; economic instruments; decision-making, capacity-building)
has become somewhat repetitive. 

143. The experience of the first programme of work of the Commission should
be taken into account in designing the next cycle of the work programme. 
In addition, the substantive results of the assessment of overall progress
in implementing Agenda 21, and future priorities to be identified at the
special session, would need to be considered.

144. Following the 1997 review, the Commission should continue to provide a
central forum for reviewing further progress in the implementation of
Agenda 21 and for policy debate on sustainable development in general.  At
the same time, it would seem essential for the Commission to ensure a
greater focus on those issues that require further policy discussion and
agreement.  Comprehensive reviews of all chapters of Agenda 21 could be
carried out only once in several years, or as the need arises. 

145. It is suggested that the future programme of work of the Commission
could be organized on the basis of the following considerations:

     (a)  Implementation of all chapters/thematic areas of Agenda 21 will
continue to be reviewed.  However, only a limited number of
chapters/thematic areas will be given in-depth consideration in a given
year.  Other chapters/thematic areas will be reviewed only in the context
of their relationship to those chapters/areas which are the current focus
of discussion.  In other words, chapters/thematic areas chosen in a given
year for a focused, in-depth discussion could serve as an "entry point" to
a broader discussion, involving linkages with related provisions under
other chapters (both in terms of conceptual and/or policy linkages, and in
terms of consideration of relevant means of implementation);

     (b)  The following criteria may be applied for selecting those issues
which would be the subject of focused discussion in the next multi-year
programme of work of the Commission: 

     (i)  Issues should be of significance in achieving the goals of
          sustainable development worldwide, involving promotion of
          policies which integrate economic, social and environmental
          dimensions of sustainability and promote coherence of action at
          all levels;

    (ii)  Issues should require further dialogue and consensus-building
          before internationally agreed strategies or frameworks for action
          could be adopted;

   (iii)  Issues should be "cross-cutting", providing the opportunity for
          integrated consideration;

    (iv)  Issues should involve means of implementation, the role of
          various economic sectors and major groups, and matters relating
          to socio-economic factors, such as health or consumption and
          production patterns, which need to be given a more prominent role
          in the work programme.  However, consideration of these issues
          would be better integrated into the discussion of specific
          thematic areas; 

     (v)  Issues which are addressed in Agenda 21, but which are dealt with
          in a systematic way in another intergovernmental body/process
          (i.e., human settlements (Commission on Human Settlements);
          poverty (Commission for Social Development); climate change
          (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change);
          biodiversity (Convention on Biological Diversity);
          desertification (United Nations Convention to Combat
          Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought
          and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa)) may not be the
          subject of separate focused discussions in the Commission, but
          should be considered only in terms of their relationship to other
          issues;

     (c)  To lighten the Commission's agenda and to provide for a more
focused and in-depth consideration of key policy issues, the Commission,
during its next programme cycle, could limit itself to only three
substantive items on the agenda of its annual sessions.  This would allow
the Commission, during the next four years (1998-2001) to consider
thoroughly all issues that will be selected for in-depth discussion and, at
the same time, undertake an integrated analysis of all of the chapters of
Agenda 21.  In 2002, the Commission could carry out a second comprehensive
review of overall progress in the implementation of Agenda 21 in its
entirety.

146. More specifically, in a given year the Commission could include three
substantive items on its agenda: 

     (a)  An item dealing with a cluster of cross-sectoral issues;

     (b)  An item focusing on sustainable development in a natural resource
sector;

     (c)  An item focusing on the role of a relevant economic sector/major
group in sustainable development.

For example, the programme of work of the Commission for the next five-year
period could be organized as shown in the table below.

147. The suggested timing for the consideration of various "key" themes
takes into account the time when similar issues were considered in the
Commission during the period 1993-1996, relevant decisions taken by the
Commission and other intergovernmental bodies that deal with the
consideration of specific issues after 1997, and expected outcomes of
ongoing intergovernmental processes.  The General Assembly at its special
session may wish to consider a different schedule.  Special consideration
was also given to conceptual linkages between various issues, inter alia,

in a given year jointly with ministers of environment and development.
