<H3>8. Enclosures and exclusions: wildlife conservation schemes and pastoral 
tribes in the Middle East by Dawn Chatty</H3>
<H4>Conservation schemes in Arabia continue to regard local populations as 
obstacles to be overcome - either by monetary compensation or by special terms 
of local employment - instead of as partners in sustainable conservation and 
development.</H4>
<P>Wildlife conservation schemes, which aim to protect endangered fauna and 
flora, have a relatively recent history in northern Arabia. Their philosophical 
underpinnings, however, stem from a long African colonial and post-independence 
tradition. In East Africa and elsewhere, pastoral populations were long ago 
forced off their grazing lands in order to create parks for wildlife and 
tourists (Turton, 1987; Howell, 1987; McCabe <I>et al</I>, 1992). Conservation 
meant the preservation of flora and fauna and the exclusion of people, and 
indigenous peoples were often regarded as impediments, not only to the state’s 
conservation policy but also to its general desire to modernise and develop. 
</P>
<P>There are numerous examples of such displacement in Africa, including farmers 
and pastoralists in Chad, the Maasai who were expelled from the Serengeti in 
Tanzania, and the Berber of the High Atlas region of Morocco. The study of the 
Ik, in perhaps the most grotesque example of the conservation process of forced 
removal and relocation, documented the consequences when a community was 
expelled from traditional hunting grounds in order to create the Kidepo National 
Park in Uganda. Obliged to adopt agricultural techniques for subsistence, the 
community suffered prolonged famine leading to a total collapse of the society 
(Turnbull, 1972). </P>
<H4>Recent alternatives to the traditional conservation paradigm</H4>
<P>For several decades now, there has been a growing body of opinion that argues 
for a more pluralistic way of thinking about the world and how to change it (eg 
Vickers, 1981; Pretty, 1994). Ecosystems are now more clearly regarded as 
dynamic and continuously changing, and the importance of people in their 
development is being acknowledged. This concern is based upon a new 
understanding of human populations as nurturers and conservers rather than 
simply destroyers of their own environments. In conservation circles there is a 
growing recognition that without local involvement there is little real chance 
of protecting wildlife, and the concept of 'conservation with a human face’ 
(Bell, 1987) and the need for community participation (IIED, 1994) are now at 
least discussed. A few promising examples of African conservation efforts are 
now emerging where efforts are being made to integrate indigenous human 
populations into conservation and development projects (IIED, 1994). </P>
<P>Transposed to Arabia, Africa’s new found conservation wisdom loses something 
in the translation. Using the internationally supported oryx reintroduction 
project in Oman<A href="http://www.fmreview.org/fmr028.htm#notes">(1)</A> as a 
starting point, I aim to show that conservation schemes in Arabia continue to 
regard local populations as obstacles to be overcome - either by monetary 
compensation or by special terms of local employment - instead of as partners in 
sustainable conservation and development.</P>
<H4>Omani case study</H4>
<P>The earliest expression of interest in conservation in Arabia emerged in the 
middle of this century as the alarming rate at which gazelle, oryx and other 
'sporting’ animals were being caught or killed became clear. By 1972, the oryx 
was extinct in Oman and the rest of Arabia. In 1977 and 1978 a consultant with 
the World Wildlife Fund toured extensively through the interior of Oman trying 
to locate an 'ideal’ place for a reintroduction project. He concluded that the 
ideal habitat for the oryx reintroduction would be in the Jiddat-il-Harasiis and 
that the whole of the Jiddat-il-Harasiis should be proclaimed a wildlife reserve 
or sanctuary. These recommendations were adopted, and in 1980 the first oryx 
from the World Herd were flown back into the country and released into the main 
oryx enclosure at Yalooni. Ten Harasiis tribesmen, out of an indigenous 
population of 3,000, were hired to serve as oryx rangers, tracking the animals 
and keeping daily records of their movements. For the first three years there 
were no conflicts between the indigenous population, the growing expatriate 
conservation management team, and other Omanis.</P>
<P>Thereafter, difficulties gradually appeared in terms of competition over 
grazing, during prolonged drought, between the herds of domestic goat and camel 
and the reintroduced oryx (Stanley Price, 1989: 212-213), between the lineages 
of the Harasiis tribe over access to employment and special benefits, and 
between the Harasiis and rival tribes who had been completely ignored in this 
conservation effort. The appearance of poaching, first reported in 1986 and 
increasing yearly thereafter, by rival tribesmen and - some say - disaffected 
youth, point to the flaws in planning, design and implementation which top-down 
conservation projects all too often have. The animal reintroduction project was 
developed with near total disregard for the indigenous human population. The 
idea of setting up an oryx sanctuary in Harisiis traditional territory was never 
discussed with the Harasiis, nor were they consulted on the most suitable area 
to place such a sanctuary<A 
href="http://www.fmreview.org/fmr028.htm#notes">(2)</A>. The aims of the 
project, its goals, the implied restrictions on infrastructural development, and 
even the importance of their cooperation were never put forward to the tribal 
community. </P>
<P>As long as the Harasiis had no aspirations of their own, no desire to see an 
improvement in their access to water, no desire to have regular road grading, or 
infrastructural development in their traditional homeland, relations with the 
oryx reintroduction project remained untroubled. A confrontation over grazing 
competition in the mid 1980s as a result of which the oryx reintroduction 
manager requested that the Harasiis move away - and some refused - should have 
raised the alarm with conservationists. The Harasiis eventually came to realise 
that conservation placed constraints on the development of the region. At the 
same time, the age old rivalry between the Harasiis tribe and their neighbours, 
the Jeneba, found new expression. Although the relationship cannot be proved, 
the fact that there has been a rapid rise in the rate of poaching (nearly 30 
oryx were poached in 1996 alone - 10 per cent of the total herd)<A 
href="http://www.fmreview.org/fmr028.htm#notes">(3)</A>, and that those caught 
have all been Jeneba tribesmen, suggests that intertribal rivalry is on the rise 
and that the project is not maintaining its popularity, or at least not with the 
youth of the tribe who grew up during the time when the oryx was extinct and 
therefore not really a part of their cultural tradition. To these disaffected, 
largely unemployed youths and rival tribesmen, the oryx sanctuary makes no 
sense. The opportunity to make some money by illegal poaching becomes a 
difficult temptation to resist when there is no sense of ownership or 
participation in the sanctuary.</P>
<H4>Pastoralists and conservation in Syria</H4>
<P>Syria is now studying international conservation proposals to develop its own 
protected wildlife area in a part of the desert that provides crucial winter and 
spring grazing for the herds of a number of already marginalised Bedouin 
tribes.</P>
<P>Establishment of the independent nation-state in the late 1940s and 1950s saw 
the culmination of several decades of sustained efforts to control and break 
down pastoral tribal organisation. Since then the Bedouin land holdings, once 
held in common, have been increasingly registered in the names of tribal leaders 
of important families and converted into farms. Some Bedouin families settled on 
the fringes of this agriculture. Many combined some farming with pastoralism, 
moving their herds out into the <I>Badia</I><A 
href="http://www.fmreview.org/fmr028.htm#notes">(4)</A> in late winter and early 
summer. Others moved away from these fringe areas, and began settling seasonally 
in small hamlets in the<I> Badia</I>, keeping their herds on the move for much 
of the year in search of natural grazing and post-harvest stubble.</P>
<P>The 1960s was a period of strenuous government land reform, including the 
complete seizure of all common tribal land and the confiscation of the large 
tracts of land owned by tribal leaders. Following a three-year-long drought in 
which over two million sheep died, the government instituted a programme to 
alleviate the problems caused by this ecological disaster. A UN project was set 
up to revitalise the pastoral sector of the Syrian economy with the primary goal 
of stabilising the livestock population. After a number of false starts, it 
launched a campaign to convince agencies concerned with rangeland of the 
importance of studying the human factor. It argued that the best means of 
repairing the damage overgrazing had caused in the desert, and improving the 
Bedouin economy, was by reviving the Bedouin tradition of <I>hema</I> (ie 
returning control over range conservation and management of grazing lands to the 
Bedouin). These recommendations for a return to a system of communal ownership 
appealed to the Syrian government’s socialist orientation and the proposal was 
accepted. After several years of trial and error, a programme of cooperatives 
was implemented whereby block applications by tribal units for control over 
their former traditional grazing lands were entertained by the government. 
Today, perhaps two thirds of Syria’s Bedouin population are member of <I>hema 
</I>cooperatives and associated schemes. As membership has never been mandatory 
but rather the individual choice of a tribesman within a lineage group, the 
majority of Syria’s Bedouin are joining because they perceive a benefit from 
doing so. The benefit is both as an individual herd owner and as a tribesman in 
terms of access to managed grazing, preferential prices for feed, and some 
credit facilities. </P>
<P>Despite numerous ups and downs caused by changing legislation, and inadequate 
restraint on the spread of agriculture into the <I>Badia</I>, the current 
situation which allows Bedouin a participatory voice in the running of 
cooperatives is an improvement over the uncontrolled grazing of the 1950s and 
the rigid government regulatory schemes of the 1960s. </P>
<H4>Conservation of wildlife in the <I>Badia</I></H4>
<P>In 1992 Syria attended meetings of the Commission for Natural Parks and 
Protected Areas of the World Conversation Union in Sicily, and negotiated 
funding for a project to rehabilitate rangeland and to establish a wildlife 
reserve in the Palmyra <I>Badia</I>. The project proposes to address three 
interrelated issues: diminishing grazing land, disappearing wildlife, and 
increasing requirements for supplemental feeding of domestic herds. It also 
proposes to incorporate some of the land holdings of three <I>hema</I> 
cooperatives into protected ranges, to set up restrictions on access by Bedouin 
and their domestic herds, and to run a programme to introduce new plant species. 
Within two years, it expects to have obtained “higher forage production from the 
Al Badia Rangelands to enable domesticated animals and wildlife to live in 
harmony on the land” (FAO, 1995:7). In the third and final year of this project, 
physical boundaries will be established and “the reserve will only be devoted to 
wildlife grazing” (FAO, 1995:7). In other words, at the close of the project, 
the Bedouin and their herds will be excluded from an important area of 
rehabilitated rangeland.</P>
<P>Although the project will need the cooperation of the Bedouin communities 
that have used these grazing lands for the past few decades, no visible effort 
is made in the technical description of the project to incorporate them in its 
planning, development or implementation. What this project reveals is either the 
short memory of government or the difficulty of learning from past experience. 
The lessons that should have been learned in the 1960s after the Syrian 
government, with the assistance of a UN agency, attempted to revive nomadic 
sheep breeding without including people into its plans, have simply been 
forgotten. Pastoralists cannot be separated from their animals or from their 
common grazing land. Furthermore, the underlying assumption of this project 
seems to be the now stale assumption (see, for example, Behnke et al,1993; 
Pimbert and Pretty, 1995:5) that it is pastoralists that are overgrazing, or 
overstocking, and that the solution is to reduce herd numbers and restrict their 
access to land in order to protect its carrying capacity. This assumption simply 
provides a scapegoat for a problem rather than looking for sustainable 
solutions. Such a search requires the inclusion of the affected population, not 
their exclusion and further displacement. The Bedouin need to be part of the 
project. Their perceptions of the problems, causes and possible solutions need 
to be taken into account. Their needs for their own herds - their access to 
graze, water and supplemental feed - need to be considered as well. For without 
accommodation of their needs, Bedouin will not support the conservation project. 
</P>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<P>Sustainable conservation requires, above all else, the goodwill of indigenous 
populations and not their forced exclusion or displacement. As McCabe and others 
(1992:353-366) have demonstrated, linking conservation with human development 
offers the most promising course of action for long-term sustainability of 
nature and human life. Nature reserves and other protected areas must be placed 
in a regional context. If the economy of the human population is in a serious 
state of decline, the establishment of a wildlife reserve in their midst does 
not augur well for long-term sustainability. The population is unlikely to see 
any benefit from such a scheme and cooperation is unlikely. If, on the other 
hand, the problems of the human population are addressed and the community 
envisages benefit from a combined conservation/development scheme, then 
cooperation and long-term sustainability are possible.</P>
