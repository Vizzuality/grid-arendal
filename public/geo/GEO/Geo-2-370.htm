<P>Executive Summary 
<P>THE NORTHERN BOREAL FORESTS make up almost a third of the Earth's forests, 
covering about 15 million square kilometres, and ranging across Russia, Canada, 
the United States, Scandinavia, and parts of the Korean Peninsula, China, 
Mongolia and Japan. 
<P>Drawing on the latest research on forest ecology, the impacts of recent 
climate change, and studies on projected future climate change, this report 
shows that between 50 and 90 percent of the existing boreal forests are likely 
to disappear as a result of a doubling of atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases. This doubling is expected to take place over the 
next 30-50 years, and is likely to create abrupt changes in the Earth's climate 
that would result in severe forest decline. The rate of decline is still 
uncertain, but is likely to be rapid in many regions, and driven by massive 
fires, insect outbreaks and storms. 
<P>There is growing and alarming evidence that this decline is already beginning 
and is driven by a level of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere that is 
currently higher than has been seen in over 150,000 years. 
<P>The projected decline could contribute to the rapid release of hundreds of 
billions of tonnes of additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, 
accelerating the rate of climate change. 
<P>The emerging and potential impacts of climate change threaten the more than 
one million indigenous people who live in the boreal forest, as well as a loss 
of wildlife and plant diversity through the destruction of habitat. Key 
endangered species living in the boreal forest, such as the Siberian tiger, are 
already on the brink of extinction. Climate change and current logging practices 
further threaten such species. 
<P>Current logging practices are aggravating forest decline by decreasing the 
ability of the boreal forest to withstand disturbances, increasing stress by 
changing moisture and temperature regimes, and releasing greenhouse gases. 
<P>Serious disturbance of the boreal forest ecosystem can be traced back to an 
abrupt shift in the global climate in 1976. Since then higher temperatures have 
sparked larger and more frequent fires throughout the boreal forest, and the 
number of storms and damaging insect outbreaks has increased. These disturbances 
have been accompanied by a decline in conifer populations in the southern part 
of the boreal forest. 
<P>Unless atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are quickly stabilized 
climate-vegetation models predict that large areas of boreal forest will be 
reduced to patchy open woodland and grassland, resulting in lowered biological 
diversity and a reduced ability to store carbon. 
<P>Studies of the global carbon cycle suggest that boreal forests are not 
absorbing as much carbon as they did before 1976. As a result, the atmosphere 
already appears to contain 10-15 billion tonnes of carbon more than it would 
have if forests had continued to absorb carbon at the pre-1976 rate. 
<P>If boreal forests continue to decline, estimates suggest that burning and 
rotting of boreal forests could contribute to the release of up to 225 billion 
tonnes of extra carbon into the atmosphere, increasing current levels by a 
third. This would accelerate the rate of climate change. 
<P>While it is possible that the boreal forest could expand into the frozen 
tundra as temperatures increase, such an expansion would likely be delayed by 
slow tree migration rates and the adverse effects of increased ultraviolet 
radiation on trees from ozone depletion. 
<P>Even in the long term, the boreal forest is not expected to expand enough to 
compensate for the deterioration in the southern part of the forest. 
<P>This report calls on policy and decision makers to radically rethink and 
change energy policies and logging practices in boreal forest countries in order 
to protect and preserve the climate and biodiversity. Such changes are 
consistent with their obligations under the Climate Convention and Biodiversity 
Treaty established by the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
<P>GREENPEACE BELIEVES that climate change and severe forest decline can only be 
halted by: 
<P>* A planned and orderly global phase-out of fossil fuels and their 
replacement by the efficient use of renewable and clean energy sources, 
including the immediate reduction of greenhouse gas levels by at least 20 
percent by 2005. 
<P>* An end to global deforestation and the introduction of a programme of 
ecologically-based reforestation. 
<P>* The immediate phase-out of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, and their replacement by 
chemicals which do not damage the ozone layer or contribute to the human-induced 
greenhouse effect. 
<P>Chapter 1 
<P>Rigging the Bomb: The Carbon Crisis 
<P>The Greenhouse Effect 
<P>FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS, the naturally-occurring greenhouse effect has played a 
crucial role in determining the Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases such as carbon 
dioxide and methane have trapped the Sun's heat near the Earth's surface, 
helping to evaporate surface water into clouds which later return the water to 
Earth. 
<P>Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be 18 
degrees Celsius below zero. The Earth would be a lifeless frozen wasteland. 
Instead, the greenhouse effect raises the Earth's average temperature by a full 
33 degrees Celsius.[2] 
<P>Rain and the sun' s warmth trapped by the greenhouse effect allow plants to 
grow and soils to form, and sustain the diversity of life. Plants and soils 
absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the air. For millions of 
years, a complex mixture of biological and hydrological systems released just 
enough carbon dioxide to maintain a fairly stable balance of these gases in the 
air. 
<P>Until now. 
<P>Climate Catastrophe 
<P>IN A MONITORING STATION at the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, scientist Charles 
David Keeling has been patiently measuring atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide 
since 1957. The results of his research, which have been confirmed and extended 
by scientists around the world, have profound implications.[3] 
<P>Keeling discovered an enormous disruption in the global carbon cycle. His 
measurements showed that carbon dioxide levels were rising rapidly. Subsequent 
research has shown that the levels of most greenhouse gases have risen 
dramatically since the last century. Carbon dioxide levels have increased by 
about 25 percent since 1850, methane levels by 100 percent, and nitrous oxide 
levels by 15 percent. Next to water vapour, carbon dioxide is the most plentiful 
and important greenhouse gas.[4] 
<P>For at least 160,000 years before the start of the Industrial Revolution, 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 parts per 
million. In 1992, carbon dioxide levels reached 355 parts per million, meaning 
that some climate change is already inevitable.[5] Some scientists fear this is 
already happening. 
<P>A recently released Greenpeace review of extreme weather events suggests that 
the world's climate is, indeed, being disrupted in a manner consistent with the 
increased level of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.[6] 
<P>In the absence of urgent action by the governments of the world, this level 
may rise even higher, to more than 600 parts per million in less than fifty 
years. At this concentration. the world faces a very real and dangerous risk of 
catastrophic climate change. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) is made up of the world' s leading climate scientists. 
Their 1990 and 1992 reports estimated that some of the possible effects of rapid 
global warming could include: 
<P>* large-scale disruption of forestry, agriculture and fisheries; 
<P>* extinction of many plant and animal species on land and in the oceans; 
<P>* changing rainfall patterns; 
<P>* loss of huge tracts of coastal land under rising seas as the oceans expand; 

<P>* less access to less reliable water supplies in many parts of the world; 
<P>* serious adverse effects on human health.[7] 
<P>Writing about the impacts on forests, the IPCC said: "It is possible that 
many tree species will not be able to change their geographic distribution as 
fast as the projected shifts in suitable climate and extinctions may occur."[8] 
<P>The reality could be even worse. The IPCC has warned that its calculations do 
not include climate "feedbacks" such as biomass reactions to a warming climate, 
which could have the effect of accelerating global warming. This could include 
the release of huge quantities of heat-trapping methane from tundra regions 
north of the boreal forest. Compared to the amounts of carbon dioxide and 
methane currently in the atmosphere, natural reservoirs of these gases trapped 
in Arctic tundra, permafrost, and the world's oceans, are huge. 
<P>In a warming world these gases could be released to the atmosphere, feeding 
into the warming process and increasing its impact. A runaway greenhouse effect 
is therefore a possibility. A significant minority of scientists think it a 
probability. This would result in rapidly accelerating and unstoppable increases 
in global temperatures, with serious climate change and ecological impacts.[9] 
<P>"The rate of change <BR>of temperature <BR>predicted by the IPCC <BR>is 15-30 
times faster <BR>than any global <BR>temperature change <BR>ever known 
before."[10] 
<P>Fossil Fuels and Deforestation 
<P>HUMANS ARE ALMOST entirely responsible for this disruption of the global 
carbon cycle, mainly through burning fossil fuels which increase the level of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and removing forests which act as "carbon 
sinks" by absorbing carbon dioxide. Approximately 7.6 billion tonnes of carbon 
are currently released into the atmosphere each year. Six billion tonnes is from 
fossil fuels, and an estimated 1.6 billion from deforestation.[11] 
<P>The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas - themselves 
largely the remains of ancient forests - has expanded rapidly since the late 
19th century. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels have increased around 4.3 
percent each year since then, only declining when industrial production slowed 
during the Great Depression and the two World Wars.[12] 
<P>Carbon dioxide is also released into the atmosphere when forests are cleared 
using fire in tropical countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, and as exposed 
forest soil decomposes. The agricultural crops which usually replace tropical 
forests have a far lower capacity to store carbon.[13] 
<P>Significant amounts of carbon are also released by the logging of temperate 
and boreal forest, especially by the logging of old-growth temperate forest of 
the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia[14], but also by the rapidly 
increasing logging operations in the boreal forest.[15] 
<P>Deforestation does more than release carbon to the atmosphere; it also 
reduces the ability of forests to store carbon and act as a carbon sink by 
destroying them. 
<P>CHAPTER 2 
<P>Setting the Mechanism: Climate and Boreal Ecology 
<P>A Vast Natural Resource 
<P>THE NORTHERN BOREAL forest, also called the taiga, is a vast ecosystem that 
encircles the northern hemisphere and covers 1.5 billion hectares. or 11 percent 
of the Earth's land surface.[16] 
<P>The forest ranges from Alaska in the far west, through most of Canada, across 
the Atlantic to Norway, Sweden and Finland, through vast areas of Russia, and 
into parts of China, Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula and northern Japan.[17] 
<P>Small fragments also exist in mountainous areas south of the main forest. 
This mountain or alpine ecosystem is sometimes called "oroboreal", from the 
Greek word "oro", or mountain. Oroboreal forest is found throughout the Rocky 
Mountains and in alpine regions of Europe. 
<P>About 40 percent of the Earth's land surface is covered by dense forest, 
shrubland and wooded grassland.[18] The northern boreal forest, the temperate 
forest of the mid-latitudes and the tropical forest that grows near the equator 
are the three great forest ecosystems. 
<P>Forests have three vital functions. They help to regulate the Earth's 
climate, are home for millions of indigenous people and most of the Earth's 
terrestrial animals and plants, and they are the basis of a major global 
industry. 
<P>Thermostat For The Planet 
<P>FORESTS AFFECT THE CLIMATE in several ways. They have a profound effect on 
the local, or microclimate. Trees provide shade which lowers summer temperatures 
and prevents soil from drying out. They reduce heat loss from the ground in 
winter, and provide shelter from wind, preventing storm damage that might 
otherwise occur in more exposed areas. By regulating the global carbon cycle, 
forests also have a profound effect on the global climate. 
<P>The carbon cycle is one of the major systems that drives the Earth's 
biosphere and climate, and is, in a sense, the way the Earth breathes. The 
complex interaction between the boreal forest and climate is best understood by 
tracing the path of carbon through the biosphere and atmosphere. 
<P>Forests influence the global climate by taking in carbon dioxide and 
releasing it back into the atmosphere. Trees extract carbon from the atmosphere 
through photosynthesis which is driven by sunlight. The carbon is combined with 
water and nutrients from the soil to create the materials trees need for 
survival. Trees and animals also release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere 
through a process called respiration. 
<P>The carbon stored in trees is eventually returned to the atmosphere via 
decomposition. Trees drop debris onto the forest floor, and eventually die, 
becoming part of the litter and soil. bacteria and insects break down this 
organic material, releasing carbon back into the atmosphere in the form of 
carbon dioxide where it can be used again. Animals also consume the carbon 
extracted from the air in the form of plants and other animals, and so it makes 
its way through all life on the planet. 
<P>"The boreal forest <BR>makes up a third of <BR>the Earth's forests" [19] 
<P>A Treasure Chest of Carbon 
<P>A VAST AMOUNT OF CARBON is locked up in the world's forests. While the 
atmosphere currently contains about 750 billion tonnes in the form of carbon 
dioxide, forests contain about 2,000 billion tonnes of carbon. Roughly 500 
billion tonnes is stored as trees and shrubs and 1,500 billion tonnes as peat 
bogs, soil and forest litter.[20] 
<P>Each year about 5 percent of this amount, or 100 billion tonnes, is cycled 
through the atmosphere. This cycle is in rough balance, with about 100 billion 
tonnes absorbed through photosynthesis, 60 billion tonnes released by 
decomposition, and 40 billion released by respiration.[21] 
<P>Until recently, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has remained 
almost constant for 6,000 years, suggesting a remarkable system of ecological 
checks and balances.[22] Even a small change in photosynthesis, decomposition or 
respiration rates could, over a few decades, cause a major shift in carbon 
dioxide levels and global climate. And yet this has not happened. 
<P>Until now. 
<P>HOW CLIMATE SHAPES THE BOREAL FOREST 
<P>BOREAL FORESTS, LIKE ALL forests, play an important role in regulating the 
world's climate. In return, climate has a profound effect on the forest. 
<P>Boreal forests are complex ecological communities supporting a wide diversity 
of people, animal and plant life, and habitats. More than one million indigenous 
people live in the boreal forest. Tribes including the Dene and Cree of Canada, 
the Sami or Lapplanders of Norway, Sweden and Finland, the Ainu of northern 
Japan, and the Nenets, Yakut, Udege and Altaisk of Siberia have lived in balance 
with the forest for thousands of years. 
<P>The boreal forest is probably as widely known for its wildlife and endangered 
species. Its beautiful native bird species are well known around the world and 
include hawks and owls; crows, ravens and jays; ptarmigan and grouse; 
woodpeckers and seed- eaters such as finches, chickadees, and crossbills. 
<P>Apart from the seed dispersing function they perform, birds also eat forest 
insects such as mosquitos and black flies, and control caterpillar and beetle 
populations capable of devastating tree stands. Insects such as the North 
American mountain pine bark beetle and Siberian silkworm can periodically 
explode and kill off trees over millions of hectares. 
<P>The boreal forest is also home to a rich diversity of native mammals ranging 
from moose, deer, beavers and wolverines, to porcupines, squirrels, lemmings, 
fishes and martens. Caribou or reindeer live in the northern part of the forest 
and the tundra beyond. The large predators of the forest include black and 
grizzly bears, wolves, cougar, and Iynx. The habitat of the highly endangered 
Siberian tiger includes the southern extent of the boreal forest in the Russian 
far east. 
<P>The Forest Climate 
<P>TO THE NORTH the boreal forest is bounded by the tundra, a mostly treeless 
expanse of shrubs, grass and lichen that stretches to the ice packs of the polar 
desert and the Arctic Ocean. At its southern edge are grassland and remnants of 
the surviving maple and oak temperate broadleaf forests. 
<P>For much of the year the forest is locked in a cold winter freeze down to 
minus 40 degrees Celsius during which boreal life almost comes to a halt. The 
short boreal summer brings long, warm periods of daylight that lead to rapid 
boreal growth. The northern parts of the forest are dominated by permafrost or 
permanently frozen soil. In these areas, summer warmth only melts a thin layer 
of soil, and in winter there are only very short periods of daylight. 
<P>Forest Habitats 
<P>MUCH OF THE FOREST consists of stands of evergreen conifers. In North America 
the forest changes from pine to spruce and then to fir from west to east. Scots 
pine and Norway spruce are common in Scandinavia, while the deciduous larch is 
dominant in much of Russia. Several less abundant broad-leaved deciduous species 
also live in the boreal forest, including aspen, poplar, birch, willow and 
alder. 
<P>A variety of shrubs and grasses grow beneath the forest canopy, and the 
forest floor is usually cloaked in a rich mantle of moss or lichen. Fallen 
leaves and twigs form a forest litter that decays over centuries to create a 
deep and long-lasting forest soil which contains more organic matter than the 
trees. 
<P>Peatlands 
<P>APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION hectares - almost a fifth of the forest - is 
covered by deep layers of decomposing peat moss.[23] These peatlands form an 
ecosystem as important as the tree stands. Covered by hundreds of thousands of 
shallow lakes and fens, peatlands are among the most ecologically important 
wetlands. During the short boreal summer, these wetlands are a breeding ground 
for many migratory ducks and geese. 
<P>CLIMATE CONTROLS 
<P>THE CLIMATE MAINLY DETERMINES where boreal forest grows. In Canada, for 
example, the extent of the forest is determined by growing degree-days or the 
number of days each year above 5 degrees Celsius multiplied by the average daily 
temperature.[24] This means that grassland or deciduous hardwood species replace 
boreal forest in southern areas with too many growing degree- days, while the 
forest is replaced by tundra in northern areas with too few growing degree-days. 
A similar correlation between climate and the boreal forest is found in Europe 
and Asia.[25] 
<P>Past Patterns 
<P>PAST PATTERNS SHOW THAT specific climatic conditions are necessary for 
healthy boreal forest growth. If conditions change, so does the forest. For 
example, the boreal forest responded rapidly and dramatically to the ending of 
the last ice age. At their fullest extent, some 18,000 years ago, huge ice 
sheets covered most of Canada, northern Europe, and western Siberia, reaching 
down into Ohio in North America and as far as northern Poland in Europe. The 
boreal forest was located much further south than today. Pockets survived in icy 
shelters on the peaks of mountains that rose above the ice sheets, and at the 
foot of glaciers in regions such as Kansas and Nebraska.[26] 
<P>As the Earth warmed between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, the boreal forest 
shifted northwards. In Kansas and Nebraska, as the climate became hotter and 
drier, the forest was replaced by grassland. In eastern Siberia, which was 
largely not covered by glaciers, the cool mixture of forest and tundra gave way 
to bands of vegetation, with boreal forest bounded to the south by temperate 
broad-leaved forest and grassland. The boreal forest also grew onto land left by 
retreating glaciers, and in some places reached the shores of the Arctic 
Ocean.[27] 
<P>Can It Adapt? 
<P>PAST CHANGES IN the Earth's climate have caused profound changes in the 
location and extent of the boreal forest. These changes, though immense when 
measured over millennia, happened at a far slower rate than the climatic change 
expected over the next few decades. Can the forest adapt in time? 
<P>DISTURBANCE AND SUCCESSION 
<P>THE CLIMATE ALSO CONTROLS the location and distribution of tree species in 
the boreal forest by shaping the two opposing forces that drive boreal ecology: 
disturbance and succession. Disturbance by fire, insect and storm activity 
creates openings in the forest and occasionally removes tree stands over a large 
area. This natural process benefits the forest by preserving diversity, and 
removing ageing stands. 
<P>Once an opening is created, a second process called succession takes place, 
in which pioneer species such as grasses, herbs and shrubs move in. Depending on 
the local climate and terrain, these pioneer species may later be replaced by 
broad-leaved trees such as aspen and birch, and these may in return be replaced 
by spruce and fir. If left undisturbed for several centuries, coniferous boreal 
forest in cool lowlands can be replaced by peatlands through a process called 
paludification. 
<P>Boreal species form a natural spectrum ranging from grasses to spruce and fir 
to peatlands. Species on the right of the spectrum are long lived, slow growing, 
and tolerant of the deep shade found in old-growth coniferous forest. Species on 
the left are shorter lived, faster growing, and need more sunlight. 
<P>Disturbances that create sunlit openings in the forest often push the species 
in a boreal stand further to the left of the spectrum. In the absence of new 
disturbances, succession gradually moves the forest back to the right, towards a 
dense old-growth forest of spruce and fir. 
<P>The boreal processes of disturbance and succession may have played a 
significant role in exaggerating changes in the Earth's past climate. As the 
Earth approached an ice age, the frequency of disturbances was likely reduced 
throughout most of the boreal forest, and the forest tended towards peatlands 
and old-growth coniferous forests - the right side of the boreal spectrum. These 
ecosystems stored large amounts of carbon, reducing the level of carbon dioxide 
in the Earth's atmosphere and further cooling the Earth. 
<P>On the other hand, as the Earth warmed at the end of an ice age, the 
frequency of disturbances likely increased, releasing large amounts of carbon 
dioxide from the forest, and moving the boreal spectrum more towards the less 
carbon-intensive left side of the boreal spectrum. Warming the frozen peatlands 
also released huge quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times 
more powerful than carbon dioxide. These emissions would have contributed to the 
natural greenhouse effect, further warming the Earth.[28] 
<P>Creative Disturbance 
<P>UNDERSTANDING THE interaction of disturbance and succession gives clues about 
how the boreal forest might respond to climate change. Disturbance by fires, 
insects and storms largely determines the distribution of species within the 
boreal forest. The frequency of disturbance is closely linked to climate and can 
increase dramatically during warm, dry weather. On the other hand, the rate of 
succession can be significantly reduced by temperature, moisture or reproductive 
stress. 
<P>FIRE 
<P>FIRE IS THE MOST important driving force in boreal ecology. It plays a 
crucial role in determining the distribution of boreal species, and improves 
forest vitality by removing trees weakened by age, drought, storm, insect 
infestation or extreme cold. Forest fires are frequently sparked by lightning, 
and usually only burn a small area of forest. Fires lead to increased diversity 
in the age and type of vegetation by opening up spaces in the forest. Fires also 
clear debris, expose the soil, improve the availability of nutrients and clear 
space for seedlings to grow.[29] 
<P>[chart showing "Analysis of air trapped in Antarctic ice cores shows that 
methane and carbon dioxide contributions were closely correlated with the local 
temperature over the last 160,00 years. Present-day concentrations of carbon 
dioxide are indicated." omitted here.] 
<P>May, June and July are the main fire months in most boreal forests. Snow and 
cooler winter temperatures make fires less likely prior to this time, while 
autumn rains in August and September usually dampen fire activity afterwards. 
<P>Investigation of past fire frequency indicates that fire burns through tree 
stands about once every 50-100 years in Alaska and western Canada, once every 
130 years in eastern Siberia, and once every 200 years in eastern Canada.[30] 
Before fire suppression began in Sweden, fire occurred once every 80 years.[31] 
In the last 200 years, Swedish fire suppression programmes have eliminated 
almost all fires. 
<P>The global area of boreal forest burned each year is highly variable, 
depending largely on the weather and the amount of fuel available in the form of 
litter and drought-stressed or otherwise weakened trees. Fires are most common 
during warm, dry weather.[32] 
<P>Fire frequency plays a critical role in determining the distribution of 
species in the boreal forest. In cooler, moister areas with more than an average 
of 100 years between fires, fir and spruce tend to dominate. When fires occur 
more frequently - between every 50 and 100 years the faster growing, more fire- 
tolerant pines prosper. More frequent fires give the edge to aspen and birch. 
When fire returns more often than once every 10 years, no tree species can 
sustain itself, and the area becomes grassland.[33] 
<P>Fire plays an important role in maintaining the limits of the forest. The 
cooling climate of the Little Ice Age, which lasted from 1250 to 1850, resulted 
in huge forest fires in northern Quebec. Most of the trees destroyed did not 
grow back and the result was the mixture of tundra and scattered trees that now 
characterize northern Quebec.[34] 
<P>The grassy prairies on the southern limits of the boreal forest in western 
Canada covered an area significantly further north than today before European 
colonisation. 
<P>However, constant fire suppression has since allowed the forest to invade the 
northern grasslands and spread further south than would have naturally 
occurred.[35] 
<P>Increased temperatures caused by climate change could lead to fire occurring 
well above natural frequencies, resulting in rapid shifts in boreal species and 
forest decline. 
<P>INSECTS 
<P>INSECTS PLAY A VITAL role in boreal ecology, decomposing litter and serving 
as a food supply for birds and small mammals. The forest usually benefits from 
insect outbreaks, because they reduce the likelihood of catastrophic fire by 
helping to eliminate older stands and diseased trees. However, populations of 
insects such as bark beetles, the Siberian silkworm and the spruce budworm can 
explode and devastate millions of hectares of forest. The life cycles of the 
spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and the spruce bark beetle (Ips 
typographus) are strongly influenced by climate, with both species likely to 
increase in numbers during the kind of warmer, drier weather predicted in a 
global warming world. 
<P>[Chart showing "Fire Frequency and Species Distribution in the Boreal Forest" 
omitted here.] 
<P>The Spruce Budworm 
<P>THE SPRUCE BUDWORM is found throughout the southern boreal forest in North 
America. Its traditional range stretches from the Atlantic coast to the southern 
Yukon. A similar species, the western spruce budworm (Choristoneura 
occidentalis) can be found in the oroboreal forest throughout the Rocky 
Mountains. The spruce budworm is misnamed. It is not a worm, but the caterpillar 
larva of a moth. Its favourite food is fir, but it will also feed on spruce. 
<P>Major budworm outbreaks have occurred at thirty year intervals in eastern 
North America, which contains much of the continent's balsam fir. The most 
recent outbreak, which lasted from 1970 to the mid 1980s, resulted in the 
defoliation of 55 million hectares of forest - an area larger than France.[36] 
<P>[Chart showing "North American Spruce Budworm Outbreaks" omitted here.] 
<P>The budworm attacks mature stands of fir. Budworm populations grow 
exponentially from year to year, and usually collapse only when every accessible 
tree has been defoliated. This often leads to the death of the trees. Although 
budworms normally attack fir, occasionally outbreaks will also occur in pure 
spruce areas of the forest. 
<P>Climate plays a major role in the size and duration of a budworm outbreak. 
Over several days, female moths can fly up to 600 kilometres to lay their eggs. 
Flights normally happen in the early evening in July and only occur if the 
evening temperature is above 18 degrees Celsius.[37] 
<P>Cool evening temperatures discourage flights and lead to egg laying in a 
relatively small area of the forest. The hatched larvae may soon deplete their 
food supply and the outbreak would then collapse. On the other hand, warm summer 
nights may cause the outbreak to spread the following year. 
<P>The number of eggs laid by a budworm moth is determined by the average 
temperature. At 25 degrees Celsius, 50 percent more eggs are laid than at 15 
degrees Celsius.[38] 
<P>The development rate of the larvae is closely tied to temperature. Feeding 
rarely occurs at all if the temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius.[39] One 
of the major restrictions on the budworm's range may be that cool temperatures 
in the northern boreal forest do not allow the larvae to develop into moths fast 
enough to escape the autumn freeze. 
<P>The Spruce Bark Beetle 
<P>ONE OF THE MOST aggressive of boreal forest insects is the spruce bark beetle 
(Ips typographus). This insect is found throughout the boreal and temperate 
forests of Eurasia - from western Europe through to Korea and Japan. It normally 
attacks Norway spruce, but can also attack pine and larch.[40] 
<P>Adult bark beetles hibernate in forest litter or in the bark of wind-fallen 
trees. Emergence is determined by temperature. Growing degree-days (the number 
of days above five degrees Celsius multiplied by the average temperature) must 
reach 50 to 130 before the beetles are able to emerge. The actual temperature 
must be above 20 degrees Celsius on the day of emergence. For this reason, 
beetles in northern Europe do not emerge until late May or early June.[41] 
<P>In warmer areas of Europe, bark beetles are able to emerge earlier from 
hibernation and two or sometimes three generations of beetles can develop in a 
single season. In northern Europe, cooler temperatures normally constrain the 
beetles to a single generation.[42] 
<P>Bark beetles normally exist at a low level in the boreal forest, living in 
trees that have been weakened by lightning strikes or disease.[43] Large 
outbreaks are usually sparked by an increase in weakened trees. This can be 
caused by windstorms, forest fires, drought, or an attack by defoliating 
insects. Logging operations that leave waste wood behind in the forest can also 
cause outbreaks. 
<P>For example, a huge bark beetle outbreak in Europe at the end of World War II 
was caused by drought and poor logging practices.[44] Large outbreaks in Japan 
on the northern island of Hokkaido followed extensive storm damage caused by 
typhoons in 1954 and 1981.[45] 
<P>Once bark beetle populations grow to a critical size, they are able to 
overwhelm almost every mature tree, healthy or otherwise. Outbreaks can last for 
many years and normally collapse only when every tree within reach has been 
killed, or cold weather suppresses populations.[46] 
<P>Like most other insects, bark beetles help maintain the long- term health of 
the forest. Their normal role in attacking diseased trees helps to improve 
forest vitality. Even during outbreaks, they can help promote the long-term 
growth of a forest by removing the overstory and allowing for the growth of the 
younger seedlings beneath. 
<P>STORMS AND LIGHTNING 
<P>WARMER TEMPERATURES CAN increase the frequency and intensity of storms and 
lightning.[47] 
<P>Storms play an important role in shaping maritime boreal forests in 
northeastern Asia and North America. Typhoons are capable of destroying large 
areas of forest in northern Japan.[48] Storms in both of these maritime regions 
create "wave forests" - strips of mature forest alternating with strips of 
underbrush or young forest developing in the aftermath of severe windstorms. 
Wave forests are also common in Newfoundland and the Appalachian mountains.[49] 
Tornado activity plays a lesser role in disturbing boreal forests. In Ontario, 
storms destroyed approximately 10 percent of the forest area burned out by 
forest fires between 1950 and 1980.[50] However, tornado activity has increased 
dramatically in North America since 1980.[51] 
<P>Wind plays a critical role in magnifying the impact of other disturbances. 
Small forest fires can become larger conflagrations when fanned by gale-force 
winds. Windstorms can lead to blowdowns and generate large amounts of fuel for 
future fires or enough dead wood and damaged trees to encourage a bark beetle 
outbreak. Wind can also spread insects over long distances and so help to 
rapidly expand an outbreak. Conversely, fires and insect outbreaks can help 
increase the impact of a windstorm by creating exposed breaks in the forest. 
Lightning is the major cause of large forest fires, and plays a crucial role in 
driving fire and insect disturbances.[52] Lightning is responsible for 38 
percent of forest fires in Alaska, which in turn account for 80 percent of the 
total area burned.[53] 
<P>SUCCESSION IN THE BOREAL FOREST 
<P>THE RATE OF SUCCESSION and recovery from disturbances depends on the level of 
stress. Stress comes from three main sources: temperature, moisture levels, and 
reproduction. Each of these are profoundly influenced by climate. In particular, 
high temperatures and dry soil can slow down or halt successions converting a 
disturbed forest to shrubs or grassland. 
<P>Temperature Stress 
<P>TEMPERATURE AFFECTS THE rate of respiration and photosynthesis. Healthy trees 
grow by accumulating carbon through photosynthesis at a rate faster than they 
lose carbon through respiration and other processes. In the absence of other 
factors, increasing the air temperature accelerates the rate of both. However, 
at high temperatures, the rate of respiration surpasses the rate of 
photosynthesis, causing a tree to lose carbon and eventually die. 
<P>Moisture Stress 
<P>TREES EXTRACT WATER and nutrients through roots, and lose water through 
transpiration. A similar process, evaporation, can dry forest soils. Evaporation 
and transpiration are strongly dependent on temperature. If a tree loses more 
water than it can absorb through its roots, it will dehydrate and die. Night 
temperatures also play a crucial role in relieving moisture stress. If night 
temperatures are too high, trees can die.[54] 
<P>Spruce, pine and fir respond to moisture stress by closing tiny pores on 
their leaves or needles called stomates. With most transpiration taking place 
through the stomates, this can significantly reduce moisture stress. However, 
the stomates are also the pores which absorb carbon dioxide during 
photosynthesis. If the stomates are closed, photosynthesis stops and the tree 
may starve. 
<P>Reproductive Stress 
<P>MANY BOREAL SPECIES are dormant during the autumn, and require a long period 
of winter chilling before warmer temperatures trigger budburst and new growth. 
Reduced chilling can significantly increase the time required for budburst.[55] 
<P>Pollen and seed cones both develop very rapidly under high spring 
temperatures. However, this development may lead to abnormal and incomplete 
cones, with little pollen and infertile seeds. As a result, high spring 
temperatures can lead to reproductive failure.[56] 
<P>Boreal seeds germinate within a specific range of soil temperatures. For 
example, black spruce seeds germinate between 15 and 28 degrees Celsius. If the 
soil temperature falls below 15 degrees, the processes that cause germination 
come to a halt. If soil temperatures rise above 28 degrees, bacteria and fungi 
can attack and consume seeds. The probability of germination also declines 
rapidly for higher temperatures.[57] 
<P>Climate affects the boreal forest in many ways. In particular, warmer weather 
increases the frequency of disturbances and may decrease the rate of succession 
by creating temperature, moisture or reproductive stress. In a changing climate, 
the natural balance of the boreal forest would be expected to undergo profound 
disruption, with parts eventually reverting to grassland, some areas becoming 
more vulnerable to large-scale wildfires and insect outbreak, while some species 
could decline in the face of increasing stress.

<P>Lighting the fuse: The Impact of Recent Climate Change on the Boreal Forest 
<P>The Heat is On 
<P>SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ALREADY shows that the climate is changing: average 
global temperatures have risen about 0.5 degrees over the last century, and the 
seven hottest years since records began 140 years ago all occurred after 
1980.[59] These temperature increases have been most dramatic at high latitudes. 
Summer temperatures on Ellesmere Island, in Canada's High Arctic, are higher 
than they have been for more than 1,000 years.[60] 
<P>Weather patterns have changed at the closely monitored Experimental Lakes 
Area in the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario. Since the late 1960s, the 
average air temperature has risen by two degrees Celsius.[61] 
<P>Increasing Fires 
<P>MAJOR FIRES HAVE recently disrupted the boreal forest. An area of boreal 
forest larger than France (56 million hectares) was destroyed between 1980 and 
1989.[62] Since 1976, the area burned in Canada has soared to six times the 
century trend, and to more than nine times the century trend in the alpine and 
temperate forest of the western US.[63] Russian researchers have reported a 
sharp increase in the area of forest burned since 1985.[64] 
<P>In 1989 the worst fires on record scorched western Canada, and the area east 
of James Bay in Quebec. Fire frequency has increased since 1975 in Alaska, and 
increased over several decades in Sweden at least until fire statistics were 
discontinued in 1980. Only in Finland has there been a decrease in the frequency 
and area of boreal fires.[65]

<P>In For The Kill 
<P>UNUSUALLY LARGE OUTBREAKS of the tree-eating insect, the spruce budworm, have 
devastated the Canadian boreal forest in recent years. A Canadian government 
study released in 1987 showed that conifers were growing on average up to 65 
percent slower than in the 1940s and 1950s, because of budworm outbreaks, and 
possibly acid rain.[66] 
<P>Spruce budworm outbreaks have grown exponentially throughout North America 
this century, with each outbreak doubling in size. The outbreaks following 1910, 
1940 and 1970 affected 10, 25 and 55 million hectares respectively.[67] The next 
outbreak, due by the year 2000, could affect 100 million hectares of forest. 
Such a huge infestation could dramatically accelerate the decline of spruce and 
fir in the southern boreal forest. 
<P>[Two charts "Russian Forest Fires" and "Tornado Trends for Canada" omitted

<P>Growing Storms 
<P>METEOROLOGISTS REPORT A recent sharp increase in tornados in the U.S. and 
Canada. Canadian tornado frequency was four or five times higher than two 
decades earlier.[68] Average wind speed in the Experimental Lakes Area in the 
central boreal forest of northwestern Ontario has increased by 50 percent.[69] 
<P>1987, China: The Black Dragon Fire 
<P>WHEN THE FIRE CAME to Eastern Siberia, it was late April, 1987. Spring rain 
was light that year, and there had been little snow. Snow cover disappeared by 
early April, and much of the vast larch forest of eastern Siberia was tinder 
dry. The fires, mostly sparked by lightning, began east of Lake Baikal in the 
rugged Yablonovyy mountains and soon reached record size. Blown by gale-force 
winds, the fire reached the Amur river that separates Russia from China. Fires 
accidentally started by Chinese loggers were already raging to the south of the 
river. 
<P>After a fire was reported near Gulian on May 6, workers moved in to put it 
out. By 1:30 am on May 7, officials asked the Chinese Army for help. Despite an 
all-night effort, the fire spread towards the administrative centre of Xilinji. 
Soldiers raced gale-force winds to try to stop the fire from reaching the town's 
munitions depot. The flames leapt past the depot and consumed the town's lumber 
yard containing 100,000 cubic metres of wood. The soldiers did what they could 
to fight the inferno, but it was too late. Xilinji, a town housing twenty-two 
thousand people and largely built from wood, was destroyed by the flames. 
<P>More than 40,000 fire fighters battled the flames over the next 32 days until 
they were finally extinguished by rain in early June. In total, about 1.1 
million hectares of Chinese forest was burned. North of the Amur, a much larger 
part of the Siberian forest was burned - at least 10 million hectares. It was 
one of the largest fires in recorded history. 
<P>It was not the forestry workers who were primarily to blame for starting the 
fires, and fire fighters weren't primarily responsible for putting them out. It 
was the weather.[70] 
<P>Burning down the house 
<P>1988, USA: Yellowstone Forests Burn-out 
<P>WHEN THE FIRE CAME TO the US in the summer of 1988, Yellowstone National Park 
was gripped by the worst drought in its 112 year recorded history. Virtually no 
rain had fallen in June, July or August. Located high in the Rocky Mountains in 
northwestern Wyoming, Yellowstone is the oldest and most famous US national 
park. The Greater Yellowstone Area, which includes Yellowstone Park itself, 
Teton National Park, and six national forests, covers 2.9 million hectares. The 
peaks of the Rocky Mountains, large forests of lodgepole pine, and abundant 
moose, deer and bear, make it one of the US's most popular tourist attractions. 
<P>Strict fire suppression in the early days of the park had left Yellowstone 
with numerous old stands of lodgepole pine, many of which were now severely 
stressed by the drought. Many trees had already been killed by mountain pine 
bark beetle infestation.[71] 
<P>There were 249 fires in the Greater Yellowstone Area in 1988 - about double 
the normal number. Most of these fires burned over a small area and extinguished 
themselves quickly. This kind of fire plays an essential ecological role in 
forest vitality by renewing the vegetation and eliminating dead forest litter. 
However, 50 of the fires spread much more quickly and with more intensity than 
normal. The situation was made worse because many of the big fires were 
accompanied by windstorms of hurricane intensity. 
<P>When Yellowstone Park officials realized how dangerous the situation was, 
they launched the largest forest fire suppression effort in US history. More 
than 25,000 fire fighters joined the battle. A squadron of airplanes and 
helicopters was used to fight the fires. Pilots from all over North America flew 
more than 100 aircraft to transport supplies and bombard the flames with water 
and chemical retardants. 
<P>As the fires approached Old Faithful, the famous Yellowstone geyser, the US 
Army was called in to help. Soldiers and civilian workers dug large fire lines 
through the forest removing trees and soil to deprive the flames of fuel and 
prevent spreading. Despite the best efforts of the US Park Service and the Army, 
more than 411,000 hectares of forest in the Greater Yellowstone Area were 
damaged by the fires. Almost half of the forest in Yellowstone National Park 
itself was scorched or consumed by the flames. The tourist industry directed 
their anger at the Park Service. Don Edgarton, manager of the photo shop at the 
Old Faithful tourist complex said "We've got ten million trees that are gone ... 
They ain't saving none of them ... We're sick about what's happened to the 
forest ..." 
<P>Park officials protested that they did everything that could have been done. 
Nothing could stop the roaring 60 metre wall of flame driven by windstorms of 
hurricane intensity. The winds sometimes blew embers and burning branches 2 
kilometres in advance of the fire. No fire fighters could halt that kind of 
conflagration. It was not park officials or the US Army that determined the 
course of the Yellowstone fires. It was the weather.[72] 
<P>1989, Canada: Worst Forest Fires on Record 
<P>WHEN THE FIRE CAME to the Canadian Province of Manitoba in 1989, it struck in 
more than a thousand places. Fires erupted from the shores of Lake Manitoba, and 
spread northward for 800 kilometres. High temperatures and drought over the 
previous two years had dried out many of the peat bogs and wetlands that served 
as natural barriers to fires. As a result, fires spread much more widely than 
usual. The inaccessibility of the area and sheer number of the fires made it 
difficult to deal with most of them. At the start of the season, the Manitoba 
government had only four people to handle fire management programs for an area 
of boreal forest the size of Germany. By the end of the season, more than 3,000 
people were involved in a coordinated response to the flames. Specially 
constructed water tanks scooped up tonnes of water from northern lakes to dump 
on the flames - and still the fires grew. More fires were set off by lightning 
from thunderstorms generated by the huge clouds of smoke. Most affected were the 
indigenous Cree who have lived in Canada's boreal forest for thousands of years. 
Cree trap lines that had provided a living for decades were destroyed. Roaring 
flames leapt a kilometre across the Nelson River, forcing the evacuation of 
4,000 people from the northern community of Norway House. As Air Force Hercules 
planes lifted thousands to safety, white and indigenous communities joined 
together to fight the fires. Rail and road transport links were cut off by the 
flames. By the time the autumn rains came, Manitoba had been hit by 1,140 fires, 
over six times more than usual. About 2.7 million hectares, or 5 percent of 
Manitoba's land area, had been consumed. More than 25,000 people from dozens of 
northern towns became refugees. Similar huge fires raged east of James Bay in 
Quebec and smaller fires struck Saskatchewan and Ontario. By the end of the 
year, about 6.4 million hectares of forest was destroyed. Amir Shabbar, a 
meteorologist with the Canadian Climate Centre, pointed out that there had been 
high tornado activity on the Canadian prairies and that the Arctic had been hit 
by an unprecedented heat-wave. The cause of the worst forest fires in Canadian 
history was clear. It was the weather. [73] 
<P>The 1990s: A Fiery Tempest 
<P>THE FIRES AND STORMS which ravaged the boreal forests in the late 1980s 
continue into the 1990s: 
<P>1990: MONGOLIA: On May 10, a huge fire destroyed more than 600,000 hectares 
of forest. [74] 
<P>RUSSIA: Eastern Siberia exploded into flames again. Gale-force winds of more 
than 100 kilometres per hour spread hundreds of fires over thousands of hectares 
of Siberian forest. Fires threatened the cities of Ulan Ude and Chita. [75] 
<P>USA: The worst forest fire in more than 50 years struck central Oregon. [76] 
<P>CANADA: The small town of Webequie, Ontario, was evacuated twice in one 
summer when fires burned through more than 60,000 hectares of forest. [77] 
<P>1991: CANADA: Fires in Quebec burn hundreds of thousands of hectares and 
cloak Atlantic Canada with thick smoke. [78] 
<P>RUSSIA: A state of emergency was declared in the southern Urals after a 
heat-wave sparked huge forest fires and widespread drought. [79] 
<P>1992: CIS: The worst drought in a century withered the new republics of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. More than 19,000 forest fires flared across 
Russia. The sky over Moscow and St Petersburg was choked in smoke. Freak weather 
killed crops and destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of forest east of Lake 
Baikal. "In my whole life I can never remember such a thing happening," said one 
old peasant farmer. Inhabitants up to five kilometres away were evacuated when a 
forest fire caused the explosion of a huge weapons depot near Vladivostok in 
eastern Siberia. Fires burning in the contaminated forest near the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station created huge plumes of radioactive smoke that sent 
radiation levels soaring in parts of Belarus. [80] 
<P>USA: More than 150,000 hectares of forest were destroyed by mountain fires 
that spread to California, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and Utah. The worst fire struck 
near Boise, Idaho. Cliff Wilcox, a spokesperson for the Boise National Forest, 
called it "a total ecological disaster". [81] One fire scorched 14,000 hectares 
at Burnt Mountain in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. When the threat 
forced the US Air Force to reveal the existence of ten nuclear-powered 
electricity generators, the public demanded their removal. [82] 
<P>1993: SIBERIA: July: 20,000 hectares blaze in the far northeast, fires burn 
around Khabarovsk on Siberia's Pacific coast and more than 50,000 hectares are 
destroyed near Irkutsk. [83] 
<P>USA: President Clinton declared a major disaster in November after 26 
wildfires burnt out of control for over two weeks across 90,000 hectares of land 
stretching from the Mexican border to the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. A 
ten-kilometre-long wall of fire advanced through the LA suburb of Laguna Beach, 
destroying more than 600 homes. Damage was estimated at $950 million. [84] 
<P>Chapter 4 
<P>Packing the Gunpowder: Destabilizing the Boreal Forest 
<P>OVER THE LAST CENTURY, research suggests that about one hundred billion 
tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere by human activity has been 
reabsorbed by the world's forests. A significant amount of this carbon likely 
went into the boreal forest. This carbon absorption has helped to slow down the 
rate of climate change. 
<P>Many reasons have been put forward to explain why this carbon was absorbed. 
Regardless of the reason, there are alarming signs that this "carbon sink" is in 
decline, or has vanished altogether. In particular, increased stress caused by 
climate change and inappropriate forest management practices may be about to 
turn the boreal forest from one of the world's largest carbon sinks into one of 
the world's largest carbon sources. 
<P>THE MISSING CARBON 
<P>FOSSIL FUEL USE GREW rapidly after the mid-19th century. Carbon emissions 
from burning fossil fuels increased from half a billion tonnes in 1900, to one 
billion tonnes (1923), two billion tonnes (1955), four billion tonnes (1970), 
and are now approaching six billion tonnes. Between 1860 and 1988, fossil fuel 
burning released about 200 billion tonnes of carbon.[85] 
<P>For much of the 19th century, temperate deforestation contributed more than 
500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year. Logging is now 
consuming some of the few scattered remnants of old-growth temperate forest. At 
the same time, logging and land clearing for agriculture continues to expand in 
the tropical and boreal forests, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere. 
<P>More forest is being cleared today than ever before. Most recent estimates 
say that roughly 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon were released from deforestation 
on average between 1980 and 1990. Between 1850 and 1990, around 120 billion 
tonnes of carbon were released into the atmosphere as a result of 
deforestation.[86] 
<P>The total amount of carbon released from deforestation and fossil fuel use 
between 1850 and 1990 was therefore approximately 320 billion tonnes. However, 
less than half of this, about 130 billion tonnes, remained in the 
atmosphere.[87] It is unclear what happened to the remaining 190 billion tonnes. 

<P>According to a recent analysis by Jorge Sarmiento from Princeton, about 90 
billion tonnes of carbon was absorbed through general diffusion into the oceans. 
This is a natural process in which carbon dioxide in the oceans reaches a 
natural equilibrium with the atmosphere. Sarmiento estimates that this oceanic 
sink has been growing with the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and 
now absorbs about 2 billion tonnes of carbon a year.[88] 
<P>The remaining unaccounted-for 100 billion tonnes of carbon is the subject of 
scientific controversy. Much of this missing or residual carbon is likely to 
have been absorbed by forests. Some may also be stored in the oceans in other 
ways. <BR>__________________________________________

<P>Note: The actual annual carbon budget varies from year to year. [89] 
<BR>____________________________________________ 
<P>A recent literature survey concluded that the boreal forest absorbed about 
0.7 billion tonnes of carbon on average each year during the 1980-1990 
period.[90] This suggests that the boreal forest makes up more than a third of 
the residual sink, and may be the largest single net terrestrial carbon sink. 
Although there is controversy over where and what it is, the size of the 
residual carbon sink can be estimated each year. It began to grow rapidly in the 
mid-1930s. However, detailed data from Charles David Keeling's research shows 
that the sink fluctuates dramatically from year to year, and has almost 
disappeared several times. Moreover, the running average sink size reacted a 
peak in the mid-1970s and has since been shrinking.[91] 
<P>A recent abrupt increase in the size of the residual sink from 1992-93 is 
believed to be caused by the increased uptake of carbon dioxide by the oceans, 
most likely due to the temporary fertilization of aquatic plant life by iron 
from the Mt. Pinatubo volcano. It is not expected to continue.[92] 
<P>If the shrinking of the residual carbon sink continues, it would have serious 
consequences because carbon dioxide levels would be much higher today if the 
residual sink had not absorbed 100 billion tonnes in the period since 1850. 
<P>The atmosphere already contains 10-15 billion tonnes more carbon than it 
would have if the residual sink had continued to grow after the mid-1970s 
instead of shrinking.[93] The disappearance or substantial further reduction of 
the residual sink would cause a parallel accelerated build-up of carbon dioxide 
and more rapid climate change. 
<P>The Residual Sink 
<P>Many scientists find it surprising that there is a residual sink at all. Why 
would forests suddenly start to absorb increasing amounts of carbon after the 
1930s? Three major theories have been put forward: carbon dioxide fertilization, 
nitrogen fertilization, and forest management practices. 
<P>Carbon Dioxide Fertilization 
<P>One common theory is that because carbon dioxide can act as a fertilizer 
promoting plant growth, forests are now growing faster because of the increased 
levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Most experiments on well-watered 
individual tree seedlings in laboratory conditions have shown that doubling 
carbon dioxide levels leads to an initial increase in growth of from 20-120 
percent, with an average increase of 40 percent.[94] Boreal tree species in 
laboratory conditions have shown an average short-term increase in growth of 38 
percent.[95] 
<P>In some cases, however, increasing carbon dioxide levels only promote 
temporary growth, and can even reduce growth if the concentration gets too high. 
For example, sweet gum and loblolly pine exposed to elevated carbon dioxide over 
four months were absorbing less carbon than control trees receiving normal 
levels of carbon dioxide.[96] The decreased growth may have been caused by a 
build-up of starch in leaves and a reduction in photosynthesis.[97] So it seems 
that increased carbon dioxide does not necessarily increase growth rate in all 
instances. 
<P>Moreover, increased levels of carbon dioxide may make some vegetation more 
vulnerable to insects.[98] 
<P>Drought Resistance 
<P>Increased levels of carbon dioxide may also make vegetation more 
drought-resistant. Boreal trees other than larch normally respond to drought by 
cutting water loss by partially closing the stomates on the surface of leaves 
and needles. Since trees also absorb carbon Dioxide through these pores, severe 
drought can seriously reduce the level of photosynthesis and starve the tree. 
Increased levels of carbon dioxide might make it easier for plants to continue 
photosynthesizing, even with their stomates only partially open.[99] 
<P>However, increased levels of carbon dioxide have also been shown to increase 
stomatal opening, which makes the plant vulnerable to moisture stress.[100] 
Closing stomates will not necessarily make a tree more drought-resistant if 
increased levels of carbon dioxide have resulted in the growth of more or larger 
leaves or needles, and hence the growth of more water-losing stomates. 
<P>Nutrient Levels 
<P>The response of vegetation to increased levels of carbon dioxide is strongly 
influenced by the abundance of other nutrients, particularly nitrogen. Boreal 
soils are nitrogen deficient, meaning that increased levels of carbon dioxide 
are likely to have little influence on tree growth. As a result, if carbon 
dioxide fertilization is having any real effect, it would largely be in 
temperate and tropical forests.[101] 
<P>No studies have yet been published on the long-term effects of increased 
carbon dioxide on natural forests.[102] This is unfortunate, because laboratory 
experiments leave out one of the most influential factors: competition between 
species. A review of the literature suggests that conifers, among other forest 
species, are least affected by increased levels of carbon dioxide. Most affected 
are underbrush shrubs and grasses.[103] Faster growing underbrush could have a 
profound effect on the boreal forest. Underbrush can prevent conifer germination 
and crush or overshade seedlings. Grass can rapidly reduce soil moisture, 
especially for shallow-rooted species like spruce.[104] 
<P>There is still no scientific consensus on whether increased levels of carbon 
dioxide have or could lead to increased long- term growth or increased 
resistance to moisture stress in natural boreal ecosystems. No studies have been 
conducted in natural ecosystems. There are, however, other explanations for the 
apparent increase in carbon absorption besides carbon dioxide fertilization. 
<P>Nitrogen Fertilization 
<P>Finnish researchers Kauppi, Mielikainen and Kuusela argue that nitrogen 
oxides in acid rain, although having many negative affects on trees, may have a 
temporary fertilizing effect, leading to at least a short-term carbon gain. They 
estimate that European forests, despite clear signs of decline, are still a net 
carbon sink absorbing from 85 to 120 million tonnes of carbon each year. 
However, they warn that continued acid rain and climate change may alter this 
situation.[105] 
<P>Forestry Management 
<P>The forest products industry sees natural forest disturbance as competition 
that consumes trees that could otherwise be logged. In response, industry and 
government have worked to replace the natural ecological dynamic of disturbance 
and succession with the artificial dynamic of forest management. Immense effort 
has gone into programs to suppress disturbances, including satellite 
surveillance, water bombing airplanes, toxic pesticides and sophisticated 
biological warfare. These programs have reduced the natural diversity of the 
forest and led to large areas of ageing coniferous forest.[106] As a result, 
boreal and temperate forests have, over the last century, absorbed more carbon 
and released less carbon than they would have under normal conditions. However, 
this artificial carbon sink may now be gradually coming to an end as many ageing 
stands are no longer able to absorb more carbon, become more susceptible to 
blowdown from storms, and fire and insect outbreaks become increasingly 
difficult to suppress.[107] 
<P>"Although the <BR>circumpolar boreal <BR>forest is presently <BR>believed to 
be a sink for <BR>atmospheric carbon, the <BR>mechanisms believed 
<BR>responsible for this sink <BR>are not likely to be <BR>sustained."[108] 
<P>Combined Forces 
<P>Much of the residual carbon sink can be explained by a combination of these 
causes. However, these causes also point to an unstable sink. Carbon dioxide 
fertilization, if it exists, has natural limits. Nitrification may cause 
temporary fertilization, but increased acid rain is likely to lead to severe 
forest decline. Fire and insect suppression simply leads to ageing forests that 
are more fire and insect prone. There is clearly no guarantee that the residual 
sink will continue to expand, or even exist at all, in the future. 
<P>VANISHING FORESTS 
<P>Although natural forces may even now be reducing the ability of the world's 
forests to absorb carbon dioxide and slow the rate of climate change, human 
intervention may destroy the global carbon sink even more rapidly. The world's 
forests are vanishing at an accelerating rate. 
<P>Tropical forests are disappearing at the rate of 17 million hectares a year, 
an area the size of the Netherlands every ten weeks.[109] 
<P>The mid-latitude temperate forest has been reduced to a fragment of its 
original size, and now makes up only about one-eighth of the Earth's forest. 
Much of the temperate forest was destroyed with the expansion of Europe and 
subsequent European colonization of North America. 
<P>Human suppression of fire and insect outbreaks, and the creation of tree 
plantations have increased the area covered by temperate forest species since 
the late 19th century. However, much of this new forested area lacks the 
biodiversity of old-growth temperate forest. The few remaining areas of 
old-growth forest are now under extreme pressure from intensive logging 
operations. 
<P>Boreal Forest Under Siege 
<P>The boreal forest is now under attack by enormous clear-cut logging 
operations which remove the entire forest over huge areas. Corporations such as 
Mitsubishi, Daishowa, Weyerheuser, Noranda, and Repap have rights to clear-cut 
large areas of Canada's boreal forest. Some of these companies, including 
Hyundai, have begun logging operations in Siberia, which has the most boreal 
forest on the Earth. 
<P>Tree stands that have been clear-cut, even if replanted, will contain less 
carbon than old-growth stands. Consequently there is a net release of carbon to 
the atmosphere. Exposed soil on clear-cut land may decompose more rapidly, 
releasing more carbon.[110] 
<P>A recent detailed analysis of the 1986 Canadian forest carbon balance by 
government researchers found that logging companies are cutting more than the 
net increase in forest biomass. The shrinking Canadian forest was reduced by 28 
million tonnes from 1986-87.[111] Nevertheless, the amount of logging continues 
to grow. 
<P>Reduced Recovery 
<P>Clear-cut logging creates profound changes in the local forest climate, or 
microclimate. The barren area left behind by clear- cut logging is exposed to 
far more solar radiation than the floor of an old-growth forest. 
<P>A comprehensive study by the US Forest Service at a clearcut site in Montana 
found that clear-cutting exposed the forest floor to more than three times as 
much solar radiation as an uncut site, and almost twice as much as a site that 
had been partially cut with smaller trees left in place. Exposure sent surface 
temperatures soaring and dried out the soil. As a result, seedlings were exposed 
to intense temperature, moisture and reproductive stress.[112] Survival was 
drastically reduced. Clear-cut logging also creates breaks in the boreal forest 
and can lead to more extensive wind damage during storms. 
<P>Shade-loving seedlings like spruce and fir do not often survive in clear-cut 
sites. As a result, tree planting programmes can fail and the site can revert to 
grass and shrubs. Eventually the area may be colonised by windblown seeds of 
sun-loving trees like aspen, birch and pine. 
<P>As a result of clear-cut logging operations, spruce and fir are rapidly 
disappearing from the many areas of the southern boreal forest. A recent Ontario 
study found that logging converted almost all former spruce and fir stands into 
stands dominated by broad-leaved species like aspen and birch.[113] Global 
climate change will further contribute to the enormous stress clear-cut logging 
places on the boreal forest, accelerating the rate of forest decline. 
<P>Industry Argument False 
<P>The forest products industry often uses the argument that clear- cut logging 
mimics the natural fire disturbance common to boreal forests. This is a false 
argument. The vast majority of boreal fires are small fires that burn in the 
vegetation of the forest understory or remove only small areas of forest. 
Catastrophic fires that destroy large areas of forest are much rarer. Canadian 
fire statistics show that 50 percent of fires are less than 0.1 hectares in 
size, and 97 percent are less than 200 hectares.[114] 
<P>Even the rare catastrophic fires do not often destroy all the trees in a 
stand, and can leave more than 30 percent of the trees still alive.[115] Dead 
trees, or snags can be left standing for many years before they collapse.[116] 
As a result, there is far more shade in a burnt site than in a clear-cut, 
lowering temperatures and sharply increasing the probability of seedling 
survival. 
<P>Plantations At Risk 
<P>Even when tree planting is successful on a clear-cut site, it does not 
recreate the original old-growth forest, but instead produces monoculture tree 
plantations. These plantations tend to be more prone to disturbances than more 
diverse old-growth. 
<P>Old-growth forests contain natural poisons and inedible species which resist 
insect attack. Forest entomologist Tim Showalter explains, "Old-growth forests 
with their very complex variety of different plant species are internally 
resistant to most problem insects."[117] Plantations do not contain these 
repellents. The identical age stands in plantations create a dense even canopy 
which allows fires to spread rapidly. In contrast, a more diverse old-growth 
forest is likely to contain a more uneven canopy and scattered forest openings 
that reduce the likelihood of a large-scale fire.[118] 
<P>Plantation trees may also be more affected by blowdown due to storms. 
According to plant physiologist Richard Tinus, "One of the risks in planting a 
tree is a deformed root system. We know that planted trees will not have the 
same configuration as trees grown from seed...".[119] Poor root structures can 
lead to slower growth and blowdown in storms. 
<P>Because they are more susceptible to disturbances than natural forests, tree 
plantations and climate change may be an explosive combination. 
<P>Clear-cut logging leads to a net carbon release, produces forest areas which 
are under enormous temperature, moisture and reproductive stress, and often 
leads to the replacement of natural forest with disturbance-prone tree 
plantations. For all of these reasons, clear-cut logging makes a significant 
contribution to climate change and may contribute to rapid forest decline with 
the continued emissions of greenhouse gases. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Chapter 5 
<P>The Explosion: Computing a nightmare future 
<P>THE RECENT DRAMATIC changes in the boreal forest are associated with an 
average global warming of a fraction of a degree Celsius. Yet the IPCC predicts 
that temperatures three to nine times higher than this are expected in the next 
few decades if the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reach double pre- 
industrial concentrations. How will this enormous change affect the boreal 
forest? 
<P>The Earth's climate is an extremely complex system with wind, cloud, 
temperature, ocean current, vegetation, terrain, and the polar ice caps all 
interacting to determine the weather. Higher temperatures alter air and ocean 
circulation, the location and frequency of clouds, the distribution and vitality 
of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and the area of glaciers and sea ice 
cover. 
<P>Fortunately, it is usually easier to forecast general climate trends than it 
is to make specific predictions about the next day's weather. Climate forecasts 
can be made using computer simulations of the atmosphere, called global 
circulation models or GCMs. Because GCMs require a long period of time and 
rapid, expensive supercomputers to make their calculations, there are very few 
in existence. 
<P>Certainly GCMs are not infallible. Currently they can only deal effectively 
with large areas of land and water, and cannot yet realistically simulate the 
ocean. "Feedbacks" are implemented differently in each GCM, and so temperature 
and precipitation predictions sometimes differ, especially on a regional basis. 
<P>Despite these difficulties, GCMs are still the best tool available for 
predicting the impact of increased levels of greenhouse gases. Their success in 
simulating current and past Earth climates is growing, and there is increasing 
confidence in their predictions. In the absence of a second Earth-like planet to 
experiment with, they offer the only method available for predicting the effects 
of climate change. 
<P>Catastrophic Decline Predicted 
<P>ONE OF THE MORE comprehensive GCM studies was published in 1992 by Shugart 
and Smith from the University of Virginia, and Leemans from the International 
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria.[120] 
<P>"There seems to be a <BR>clear consensus... <BR>that both structure <BR>and 
functions of boreal <BR>regions will be drastically <BR>altered by the climate 
<BR>changes projected <BR>by present global <BR>circulation models."[121] 
<P>Comparing results using climate-vegetation models tied to the outputs of four 
different GCMs, these researchers assumed a doubling of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide levels. The results derived from all four GCMs predicted massive decline 
in the existing boreal forest. The OSU GCM results projected a 50 per cent 
decline; others projected more extreme impacts, with the GFDL GCM implying a 90 
percent decline.[122] 
<P>While the models predicted that some new forest would move into the northern 
tundra, this new growth would cover a smaller area than the forest displaced to 
the south, reducing the total size of boreal forest and its capacity to act as a 
carbon sink.[123] 
<P>Mapping the Climate 
<P>SEVERAL DECADES AGO, L.R. Holdridge observed a close correlation between 
climate and vegetation distribution.[124] Based on temperature and 
precipitation, he developed a system of 37 global life zones. Holdridge's life 
zones system is a useful tool for predicting the impact of climate change 
because it can describe the distribution of a wide variety of vegetation based 
on simple variations in temperature and precipitation. 
<P>[Four maps with the following caption are omitted here: <BR>"THESE MAPS SHOW 
the expected response of the boreal forest to the climate change projected by 
general circulation models as a result of doubled levels of carbon dioxide. The 
original maps have been simplified to focus only on the boreal forest, and have 
been adapted to show how the existing forest is projected to change. <BR>General 
circulation models are not yet accurate at the regional level. These maps are 
intended to show the scale of potential impacts on the forest, and are not 
likely to be accurate in detail within specific regions. We have chosen two 
substantially different models to show the range of potential impacts. <BR>The 
OSU model projects the disappearance of 50% of the existing forest. The GFDL 
model projects the disappearance of over 90% of the existing forest." ][125] 
<P>The boreal forest forms a unified ecosystem with a distribution determined by 
climate. However, each species of vegetation found in the forest responds 
slightly differently to changes in temperature and precipitation. E.O. Box 
recognized this and developed a modification of Holdridge life zones that 
allowed for several species in each life zone. Cramer and Leemans used Box's 
model and the OSU GCM to compare the impact of doubled levels of carbon dioxide 
on evergreen conifers such as spruce and pine, which dominate in North America 
and Europe, and deciduous conifers such as larch, which dominate in Siberia. 
This research projected a 66 percent decline in existing evergreen conifers, and 
a 31 percent decline in existing deciduous conifers. Most notably, spruce and 
pine disappear almost entirely in Scandinavia.[126] 
<P>Succession Models 
<P>STATIC VEGETATION models such as the Holdridge life zones do not provide 
detailed information on how the forest will change or decline. Instead, a number 
of more complex succession simulation models have been developed to examine 
this. These succession models include the impact of soils, drainage, 
inter-species competition, shading, and other factors. The models must deal with 
the fact that the projected climate change is at least 15-30 times faster than 
any previously known.[127] In many cases, seedlings that sprout in one kind of 
climate will come to maturity in an entirely different climate, putting great 
stress on the forest. 
<P>Succession models are complex and require an enormous amount of computation. 
For this reason, most published results look at a few specific sites. One 
exception is a series of maps produced by Overpeck and Bartlein showing changes 
in the distribution of various species in eastern North America under doubled 
levels of carbon dioxide. The results are consistent with predictions from 
static vegetation models and show a severe decline in conifers, especially 
spruce, coupled with some forest growth into the tundra.[128] 
<P>Fire 
<P>THE DECLINE OF MUCH of the southern boreal forest may be driven by increases 
in drought and fire frequency. For example, the soil in many parts of the boreal 
forest may dry out because increased temperatures will lead to more evaporation. 
This is likely to happen even if there is more snow, as some GCMs project. 
Warmer winters may lead to earlier springs with longer periods of warm weather 
giving more time for snow to melt and evaporate, leading to drier summers and 
increased drought. 
<P>Two areas of the boreal forest are especially prone to an increase in 
drought: the region around east of Lake Baikal in Siberia, and the western 
Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Most GCMs project 
significant drought in these areas. Much of the oroboreal forest in the Rocky 
Mountains may also be replaced by scrubland or grassland. 
<P>Fire would rapidly accelerate the conversion of drought-stricken forest to 
grassland. NASA scientists Colin Price and David Rind found that doubling carbon 
dioxide levels would lead to a 26 percent increase in lightning strikes.[129] 
Warmer weather would also add to atmospheric turbulence, increasing the 
intensity and frequency of windstorms, turning ordinary forest fires into 
roaring infernos.[130] 
<P>Based on an examination of the results of three different GCMs, Flannigan and 
Van Wagner concluded that climate change would increase Canada's annual fire 
severity rating by about 46 percent. However, this study may be an underestimate 
because it did not consider changes in lightning frequency or in the length of 
the forest fire season. In a follow-up study, Wotton and Flannigan concluded 
that the Canadian fire season would increase by more than 20 percent.[132] 
<P>Insects and Competition 
<P>IN SOUTHERN AREAS OF the boreal forest where increased temperature does not 
lead to decline into grassland, conifers will suffer from insect outbreaks and 
increased competition from temperate broad-leaved species like maple and oak. 
Spruce is especially sensitive to warm weather. A study of boreal forest around 
Stockholm, Sweden, predicts the complete disappearance of spruce due to warm 
winters.[133] A similar study of eastern North America shows a retreat of spruce 
to the shores of Hudson Bay and part of northern Quebec.[134] 
<P>Conifers would be extremely vulnerable to insect outbreaks, and spruce 
budworm and bark beetle outbreaks would be strongly encouraged by warmer 
temperatures. Increased drought could change the effect of storms and insect 
outbreaks. Instead of encouraging the growth of conifer seedlings by removing 
the forest overstory, storms and insect outbreaks could create large amounts of 
fuel for more frequent fires, transforming many spruce and fir stands into 
grassland or stands dominated by pine or boreal broad-leaved trees. Higher 
temperatures are also likely to decrease the reproductive success of many 
conifers, making it less likely that conifer stands will be able to recover from 
major disturbances. 
<P>A computer simulation of responses to climate change in the boreal forest of 
interior Alaska also predicted a diverse response. Climate warming in poorly 
drained north slopes would convert a cold black spruce forest into a warm mixed 
deciduous and spruce forest. Warming of a well drained south slope would lead to 
a dry aspen-dominated forest or even the formation of grassland.[135] 
<P>This patchwork response is consistent with federal researchers' projections 
for the Canadian boreal forest. Their study concluded that much of the boreal 
forest in Ontario and southern Quebec will decline into a patchwork of grassland 
and temperate forested area, or transitional grassland.[136] 
<P>Climate change is likely to drive the southern boundary of the boreal forest 
northwards much more rapidly than the migration rates of temperate trees, such 
as maple and oak. As a result, much of the southern boreal forest may be reduced 
to a degraded ecosystem of shrubs and scattered stands of aspen and birch.[137] 
<BR>________________________________________________ 
<P>INTERACTION WITH ACID RAIN and air pollutants may worsen forest decline and 
lead to the development of grassland or degraded forest where climate models 
alone might suggest the development of temperate forest. Surveys in Finland, for 
example, reveal an acid-rain-linked decline in lichen over an area of more than 
10 million hectares. [138] 
<P>Lichens play a crucial role in the moisture and thermal regimes of forest 
soils. A lichen mat reduces moisture stress and allows trees to exist on soil 
that would otherwise be too dry to support growth. Because lichens have high 
reflectivity and low thermal conductivity, they also insulate the underlying 
soil from heat. A 12 cm deep lichen mat can reduce the soil heat flux by almost 
50 percent. [139] An important effect of the lichen decline may be to dry out 
the soil and increase the frequency of drought. 
________________________________________________ 
<P>Expansion Into Tundra 
<P>THE ARCTIC TUNDRA is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Vegetation 
models based on the GFDL and UKMO GCMs predict the complete disappearance of the 
existing tundra if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels double. Modeling based on 
the OSU and GISS GCMs predicts the disappearance of 75 percent of the existing 
tundra. Although melting polar ice is expected to allow the development of new 
tundra closer to the pole, all models predict a drastic overall reduction.[140] 
<P>The major reason for the shrinking of the tundra is the northward expansion 
of the boreal forest. The tree-line where the forest meets the tundra is 
strongly influenced by climate and has moved long distances in the past. Tree 
growth within the existing forest-tundra transitional zone may occur quickly 
because tree stands are already widely dispersed and can expand rapidly. 
However, movement of the tree-line further north into the tundra is likely to 
happen more slowly. 
<P>The fossil pollen record shows that past migration rates were far slower than 
the changes predicted for the future climate. Spruce, for example, has responded 
to past climate change by expanding its range by 80-500 metres per year. Fir has 
moved about 20-300 metres per year, while pine has moved more rapidly, by about 
1,500 metres per year. 
<P>On the other hand, climate-vegetation models suggest shifts in the boreal 
forest of 500 kilometres or more in less than a century. This works out to 5,000 
metres per year or more than 10 times the historic migration rates of most 
boreal species. It may take the boreal forest several centuries to expand as far 
north as some models predict the climate will allow. 
<P>"The carbon pulse could <BR>release as much as <BR>225 billion tonnes -- or 
<BR>almost one-third of all <BR>the carbon now in the <BR>Earth's 
atmosphere."[141] 
<P>The Ozone Threat 
<P>THE NORTHWARD EXPANSION of the boreal forest is likely to be delayed by 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation because of ozone depletion. While an ozone 
hole has not yet developed over the northern hemisphere, increasing greenhouse 
gases could in future further lower Arctic stratospheric temperatures enough for 
this to happen. The boreal forest - and the one billion people that live to its 
south - would be exposed to sharply increased levels of ultraviolet 
radiation.[142] 
<P>Studies show that ultraviolet radiation negatively affects seedling growth. 
For example, three-year-old loblolly pine seedlings exposed to ultraviolet 
radiation grew 20 percent less than similar unexposed plants.[143] A similar 
study on other seedlings found that UV-B reduced jack pine biomass by about 25 
percent, and reduced white spruce and black spruce biomass by about 50 
percent.[144] 
<P>Unfortunately, phasing out all ozone depleting substances will not be enough 
to prevent a hole in the northern ozone layer. Enough ozone destroyers will 
remain in the atmosphere to cause serious ozone depletion for at least a 
century.[145] 
<P>The Carbon Pulse 
<P>Increased stress and disturbances are likely to destroy existing boreal 
forest much more quickly than new boreal forest can expand onto tundra, or 
temperate forest can expand into former boreal areas. Moreover, warmer 
temperatures will have an immediate impact on the rate of soil decay, and the 
subsequent increased rate of soil carbon release into the atmosphere. 
<P>As a result, many studies project a massive net release of carbon into the 
atmosphere - a "carbon pulse". A recent study on the implications of a doubling 
of carbon dioxide levels concluded that forest dieback, mostly in the boreal 
forest, could release 70 to 130 billion tonnes of additional carbon into the 
atmosphere.[146] Another study found that the carbon pulse could release as much 
as 225 billion tonnes of carbon - or almost one third of all the carbon now in 
the Earth's atmosphere.[147] 
<P>The accelerated rate of climate change caused by the carbon pulse could cause 
further carbon release, and hence even more rapid climate change - a potentially 
catastrophic positive feedback. 
<P>An unknown factor is the response of peatlands to climate change. Peatlands, 
which cover a fifth of the boreal forest, store almost two-thirds of its carbon 
- 419 billion tonnes out of a total 709 billion tonnes.[148] Peatlands are 
currently a minor net carbon sink, absorbing about 45 million tonnes of carbon 
each year. However, they are a significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas 
that is 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. 
<P>Rising temperatures could dry out southern peatlands and reduce methane 
emissions. However, warmer conditions could also melt tundra and permafrost in 
the north and release huge quantities of methane into the atmosphere. Fire could 
also speed up the release of large amounts of carbon from dried-out southern 
peatlands. Clearly more research is necessary on the role of peatlands in the 
carbon cycle.[149] 
<P>IT IS DIFFICULT to predict the detailed impacts of climate change on the 
boreal forest. However, the oroboreal forest located high in the Rocky Mountains 
is already being devastated by the warming climate in one particular area. 
<P>The severe drought that continued into 1992 in Nevada and California provided 
a frightening glimpse of the ecological destruction that lies ahead if 
human-enhanced climate change is not redressed. In addition to 
drought-encouraged fires, the six long years of little or no rain had dried up 
manmade reservoirs and natural trout streams and reduced streams to a trickle, 
destroying more than 90 percent of wildfowl nesting areas, and killing deer, 
wild horses and bears. Thousands of hectares of forest gradually weakened by the 
years of drought, succumbed to insects and disease. 
<P>Chapter 6 
<P>Disarming the Carbon Bomb: Positive Solutions for Stabilizing the Climate and 
Saving the Forest 
<P>GREENPEACE BELIEVES that the only effective and direct way to stabilize the 
climate is by sharply reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from 
fossil fuel use and deforestation. Catastrophic climate change and a severe 
decline in the boreal forest can only be prevented by stopping the build-up of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This will require three major policy 
initiatives. 
<P>1. PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUELS 
<P>THE IPCC ESTIMATES that current fossil fuel and energy use trends will result 
in a doubling of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by about 2030, and a quadrupling 
by the year 2100. The IPCC concluded that the only way to prevent a rapid 
build-up of greenhouse gases is to cut emissions by 6080 percent from 1990 
levels, which amounts to a 95 percent cut from projected emissions in the year 
2100.[150] The only way to achieve such radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions 
is to phase out fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industry often claims that a 
large-scale change in the global energy system is impossible. 
<P>A recent detailed study released by Greenpeace International shows that 
phasing out fossil fuels is entirely practical and proves the fossil fuel 
industry wrong. The study examined renewable "clean energy" sources such as wind 
turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, biomass energy crops, geothermal power, and 
small-scale hydro-electricity alternatives. It concluded that enough renewable 
clean energy is available to replace current fossil fuels and nuclear power, 
even under UN and World Bank forecasts in which the world population doubles and 
the global economy expands 14 times its present size. The fossil fuel phase-out 
would be easier to achieve if such upward population and economic trends are 
stabilized at ecologically sustainable levels. 
<P>The Greenpeace study assumes that clean energy technologies would only be 
adopted when cost-effective. Energy bills are not expected to rise higher than 
they are now. Using conservative assumptions, fossil fuel use can be cut in half 
by 2030 and eliminated by 2100.[151] 
<P>Phasing out fossil fuels will not be easy. It will take major changes in 
public and private sector policy. But there is no credible alternative if the 
world is to avoid irreversible climate change.[152] 
<P>Phasing out fossil fuels will also eliminate acid rain, smog, and other forms 
of air pollution that are causing forest decline. 
<BR>_____________________________________________ 
<P>1. Cut Subsidies for Dirty Energy 
<P>About 80 percent of OECD government spending on energy research and 
development goes on non-renewable and highly polluting fossil fuels and nuclear 
power. This money should be used to research the efficient use of renewable 
energy. 
<P>Billions of dollars of taxpayer money is spent on giving tax breaks and 
subsidies to fossil fuel exploration and marketing. Still more billions are 
spent on unnecessary road construction. These taxpayer funded subsidies should 
be cut or transferred into spending on mass public transit. 
<P>2. Ban Inefficient Products 
<P>Masses of energy are currently wasted through the inefficient use of gas 
guzzling cars, heat losing building, unnecessary and energy inefficient 
appliance, and out-dated industrial processes. Instead of this power madness 
tough standards are necessary to outlaw poorly designed products, and training 
programmes to ensure industry moves to producing and using efficient technology 
as soon as possible. 
<P>3. Energy Sector Reforms 
<P>Most of today's electricity and gas companies make their profits by selling 
as much energy as possible. This inevitably leads to the inefficient use of 
energy produced as cheaply as possible - with prices that do not take into 
account the environmental damage and costs of fossil fuels and nuclear power. 
Energy sector reforms are necessary to: 
<P>* include the environmental and social costs of energy in prices; <BR>* 
invest in reducing energy consumption rather than building new power stations or 
pipelines; <BR>* purchase more power from small-scale sources rather than 
destructive energy mega-projects. 
<P>These reforms will allow companies to phase in the more efficient use of more 
expensive renewable energy. As a result, overall energy bills will not change. 
These reforms are still compatible with profits for shareholders. A number of US 
utilities are already operating using similar principles, sometimes called 
Integrated Resource Planning. 
<P>4. Better Urban Planning 
<P>Urban sprawl must be stopped. The trend should be towards smaller cities with 
a higher population density. Cars should be excluded from most or all of each 
city, and replaced with a fast, efficient mass transit system. Cities should be 
connected by a rapid rail system. 
<BR>_______________________________________________ 
<P>2. SAVE THE FORESTS - STOP DEFORESTATION 
<P>AT THE CURRENT RATE of deforestation, most of the world's natural forests 
will be gone in a few decades. This would result in the elimination of much of 
the Earth's ability to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. It 
would also result in a massive additional release in carbon. 
<P>Clear-cut logging should be halted in temperate and boreal forests. Logging 
should proceed only on ecologically-defined principles which preserve the forest 
ecosystems. Clear-cuts followed by planting monoculture tree farms do not 
preserve the forest or biodiversity. 
<P>Much of the logging in temperate and boreal forests is to produce pulp for 
unnecessary paper and packaging. Sharp reductions in packaging, combined with 
the extensive use of recycled paper, should eliminate the need for most of the 
pulp now being produced. Changing to more labour-intensive selective logging 
practices and switching to the production of more value-added forest products 
such as furniture should result in the disturbance of far less forest with no 
loss of employment in the forest industry. 
<P>At present, tropical deforestation is being driven by inappropriate aid and 
economic development programmes that fail to offer poor people living in 
developing countries a decent standard of living. Aid and development programs 
must be changed so that they no longer contribute to tropical deforestation. 
<P>Some 200 million indigenous people live in the world's forests. They are 
often in the front line of defence against deforestation. Upholding the rights 
of these people to their lands and livelihoods is the key to stopping 
deforestation. 
<P>Carefully designed labour-intensive reforestation programmes should be 
introduced by all sectors to restore natural forest ecology. Monoculture tree 
plantations are not reforestation. 
<P>3. BAN HALOCARBONS 
<P>HALOCARBONS SUCH AS CFCs and HCFCs are greenhouse gases that also destroy the 
ozone layer. They should be banned immediately. HFCs are not acceptable 
replacements for CFCs because they are potent greenhouse gases. Acceptable 
replacements are already available for virtually all uses for halocarbons. There 
is no excuse for not using these replacements immediately.
