      reporting on regeneration results</B></FONT></H4>
      <P>The REGEN component of the National Forestry Database Program was 
      designed to use the best available information. In British Columbia, for 
      example, every harvested area is surveyed after a prescribed number of 
      years to confirm its regeneration status. In many jurisdictions, however, 
      the only available information is the results of sample surveys. From 
      these samples, the forest management agencies can model expected results 
      based on the areas harvested and how they were subsequently treated.</P>
      <P>In REGEN, regeneration status is defined in terms of nine classes which 
      relate to the level of stocking of commercial tree species, their 
      distribution and the degree to which they are affected by competing 
      vegetation. The classes are usually aggregated for presentation to 
      non-specialist audiences. The two classes used in the following graphs are 
      defined as: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Understocked</B> Disturbed forest land that will require 
        silvicultural treatment to meet stocking standards. This class includes 
        harvested areas that do not contain enough young trees to meet a 
        province's or territory's stocking standards. Natural regeneration could 
        eventually meet stocking standards, but this process would take a long 
        time. </LI></UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Successfully Regenerated</B> Disturbed areas that have 
        regenerated naturally or through planting and seeding. This class 
        includes some recently disturbed areas that are expected to regenerate 
        within an acceptable time without further silvicultural treatment. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Note:</B> The following graphs provide a picture of the status of 
      the regenerating land base resulting from the harvesting and silvicultural 
      activities described earlier in this section. </P>
      <P><A name="Regenerating Land Base"></A><FONT

      <P>This part of Section 6 describes the status of forest regeneration on 
      Crown lands that have been harvested under even-aged management systems 
      between 1975 and 1999. Most Canadian forests are comprised of even-aged 
      stands, and the trees growing in these stands reach maturity at 
      approximately the same time. These tree species are adapted to regenerate 
      after major disturbances, such as fires. Forest management of even-aged 
      forest attempts to mimic this life cycle.</P>
      <P>Selection harvesting is commonly used in uneven-aged forest stands. 
      Under these conditions, relatively small openings are created in the 
      forest canopy to maintain an uneven-aged structure with trees of all ages 
      and sizes. Regeneration is continuous in uneven-aged stands - the stands 
      are not removed and replaced like even-aged stands - and so areas affected 
      by selection harvesting are not part of the land base described here.</P>
      <P>Figure 28 illustrates the regenerating land base described above. The 
      areas shown on this graph are cumulative areas. For instance, the area 
      shown for 1975 represents the area harvested in 1975. The area for 1976 
      represents the area harvested up to and including that year (1975 plus 
      1976), and so on. The regenerating land base amounted to 16.3 million 
      hectares in 1999.</P>
      <P>The regenerating land base does not include <I>non-production</I> 
      areas, most of which consist of roads for access to forest resources, that 
      have no timber production 
objective.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>

      Harvest</B></FONT></H4>
      <P>The silvicultural systems used in managing even-aged forests for timber 
      production are clearcut, seed-tree and shelterwood harvesting. 
      Clearcutting is the most widely used silvicultural system in Canada <A 
      href="http://nfdp.ccfm.org/cp95/image_e/fig18e.htm">(see Figure 18)</A>. 
      Selection harvesting (uneven-aged management) accounted for about 9% of 
      the area harvested in Canada in 1999, about double the percentage in 
      1975.&nbsp; Commercial thinning accounted for about 2% of the area 
      harvested in 1999.</P>
      <P>While clearcutting will likely remain predominant in Canada for the 
      foreseeable future, harvesting techniques are changing. In Ontario, for 
      example, increasing use is made of "careful logging around advanced 
      growth." In Quebec, "cutting with protection of regeneration and soils" 
      was mandated by the Forest Act. In 1987, this technique accounted for 22% 
      of the area harvested under even-aged management on Crown land when the 
      new act came into force, and 81% in 1999.</P>
      <P><A name="Regeneration Treatments"></A><BR><FONT 
      color=#2f752f><B>Regeneration Treatments</B></FONT></P>
      <P>Since the 1980s, most jurisdictions have passed legislation or signed 
      agreements that require logging companies to ensure regeneration on sites 
      they harvest. The foresters' options include selection cutting in forest 
      types that are suited to uneven-aged management, clearcutting and 
      scarifying to promote natural regeneration, or adopting a modified 
      harvesting method that will protect advance regeneration. Clearcuts may 
      also be regenerated by planting or seeding.</P>
      <P>Provincial planting and seeding programs were stepped up substantially 
      in the 1980s under the Federal/Provincial Forest Resource Development 
      Agreements (or FRDAs) and through new legislation which enforced better 
      regeneration practices. By the early 1990s, planting programs had largely 
      eliminated the backlog of treatable <I>understocked</I> sites, and several 
      provinces began scaling back their planting programs <A 
      href="http://nfdp.ccfm.org/cp95/image_e/fig18e.htm">(see Figure 
      18)</A>.&nbsp; British Columbia accounted for 53% of the planting on Crown 
      land in 1994, but scaled back to 42% in 1999.&nbsp; Ontario accounted for 
      22% of the planting on Crown land in 1999.</P>
      <P>Today, forest managers rely on advance regeneration and appropriate 
      regeneration techniques to ensure that the majority of harvested areas 
      will regenerate naturally. The remaining sites are regenerated by planting 
      or seeding. Additional seedlings can be planted on sites where existing 
      regeneration fails to meet stocking standards.</P>

      color=#2f752f><B>Status of Forest Regeneration </B></FONT></P>
      <P>Figure 29 illustrates the status of the regenerating land base as it 
      evolved between 1975 and 1998. Again, this figure shows the cumulative 
      areas of <I>successfully regenerated</I> and <I>understocked</I> forest 
      lands. The graph presents the status each year of the cumulative area 
      harvested since 1975. Although the annual increase in <I>understocked</I> 
      area is small, the total that has accumulated since 1975 is substantial. 
      By 1992, it amounted to almost 2.7 million hectares. The most recent data 
      indicate that the cumulative understocked area has been shrinking since 
      1993.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>

    <TD width=600 height=32>A significant proportion of recently harvested 
      areas will always be reported as <I>understocked</I> because of the time 
      lag between harvesting and observable results of subsequent treatments, 
      such as planting, or natural forest stand development. The lag is evident 
      in Figure 30, which illustrates the regeneration status in 1999 of the 
      area harvested each year since 1975. The area that is reported as 
      <I>understocked</I> for status year 1999 is equivalent to about 80% of the 
      three years' harvest from 1997 to 1999.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
