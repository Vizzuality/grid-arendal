            <P class=h3>Financial and Human Resources Invested in Education</P>
            <P>Education is an investment in human skills. It can thus help to 
            foster economic growth (see <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/A3.xls">Indicator 
            A3</A>) and enhance productivity, contribute to personal and social 
            development, and reduce social inequality. Like any investment, 
            education has both costs and returns. While the returns to education 
            are examined in Chapter E, this chapter provides a comparative 
            examination of cost patterns in OECD countries, focusing on three 
            aspects of educational spending: 
            <UL>
              <LI>the resources that each country invests in education, relative 
              to the number of students enrolled, national income and the size 
              of public budgets; 
              <LI>the ways in which education systems are financed, and the 
              sources from which the funds originate; and 
              <LI>the apportionment of resources between different resource 
              categories. </LI></UL>
            <P class=h4>How much is spent on education? 
            <P>Effective schools require the right combination of trained and 
            talented personnel, adequate facilities, state-of-the-art equipment 
            and motivated students ready to learn. However, the demand for 
            high-quality education, which can translate into higher costs per 
            student, must be balanced against placing undue burdens on 
            taxpayers. In the absence of absolute standards for the resources 
            per student necessary to ensure optimal returns for either the 
            participant or society as a whole, international comparisons can 
            provide a starting point for discussion by evaluating how countries 
            vary in the extent of their investment in education. <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B1.xls">Indicator 
            B1</A> represents direct public and private expenditure on 
            educational institutions in relation to the number of full-time 
            equivalent students enrolled in these institutions. It also reviews 
            how countries apportion expenditure per student between different 
            levels of education. 
            <P><A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B2.xls">Indicator 
            B2</A> examines the proportion of national resources devoted to 
            educational institutions and the levels of education to which they 
            are directed. This indicator needs to be interpreted in the light of 
            various inter-related supply and demand factors, including the 
            demographic structure of the population (<A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/A2.xls">Indicator 
            A2</A>), enrolment rates at different levels of education (<A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/C1.xls">Indicator 
            C1</A>), income per capita, and national price levels for 
            educational resources. The relative size of the youth population (<A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/A1.xls">Indicator 
            A1</A>), for example, shapes the potential demand for initial 
            education and training in a country. Similarly, participation rates 
            affect educational expenditure: the higher the enrolment rates 
            (other things being equal), the more financial resources will be 
            required. 
            <P class=h4>Who pays for education? 
            <P>Cost-sharing between the participants in education and society as 
            a whole is an issue that is under discussion in many countries. This 
            question is especially relevant at the beginning and ending stages 
            of initial education - pre-primary and tertiary education - where 
            full or nearly full public funding is less common. 
            <P>With increased participation drawing from new client groups and a 
            wider range of educational opportunities, programmes and providers, 
            governments are forging new partnerships to mobilise the necessary 
            resources to pay for education. New policies are designed to allow 
            the different actors and stakeholders to participate more fully and 
            to share the costs and benefits more equitably. New funding 
            strategies aim also at influencing student behaviour in ways that 
            make education more cost-effective. As a result, public funding is 
            now increasingly seen as providing only a part, although a very 
            substantial part, of the investment in education. Private sources of 
            funds are playing an increasingly important role. To shed light on 
            these issues, <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B3.xls">Indicator 
            B3</A> examines the relative proportions of funds for educational 
            institutions that derive from public and private sources, in 
            addition to how these proportions have evolved since 1995. 
            <P>Public budgets remain the main source of funds for education. 
            However, in the second half of the 1990s most OECD countries made 
            major efforts to consolidate public budgets, and education had to 
            compete for more limited public financial support against a wide 
            range of other areas. <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B4.xls">Indicator 
            B4</A> evaluates the change in public spending on education in 
            absolute terms and relative to changes in the size of overall public 
            spending. 
            <P class=h4>How are funds allocated? 
            <P>Through subsidies to students and their families, governments can 
            help to cover the costs of education and related expenditure, with 
            the aim of increasing access to education and reducing social 
            inequalities. Furthermore, public subsidies play an important role 
            in indirectly funding educational institutions. Channelling funding 
            for institutions through students may help to increase competition 
            among institutions and result in greater efficiency in the funding 
            of education. Since aid for student living costs can also serve as a 
            substitute for work as a financial resource, public subsidies may 
            enhance educational attainment by enabling students to study 
            full-time and to work fewer hours or not at all. <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B5.xls">Indicator 
            B5</A> examines public subsidies to households for student living 
            costs and for educational expenses. 
            <P>How funds are apportioned between categories of expenditure can 
            influence the quality of instruction (through the relative 
            expenditure on teachers' salaries, for example), the condition of 
            educational facilities (through expenditure on school maintenance) 
            and the ability of the education system to adjust to changing 
            demographic and enrolment trends. Comparisons of how countries 
            apportion educational expenditure between the various resource 
            categories can provide some insight into variation in the 
            organisational structure and the operation of educational 
            institutions. Decisions on the allocation of resources made at the 
            system level, both budgetary and structural, eventually feed through 
            to the classroom and affect the nature of teaching and the 
            conditions under which it is provided. The nature of expenditure, in 
            particular the proportion of current expenditure devoted to the 
            compensation of staff (including both salary and non-salary 
            compensation), is examined in <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B6.xls">Indicator 
            B6</A>. 
            <P>Educational institutions offer a range of educational services 
            besides instruction. At the primary and secondary levels of 
            education, institutions may offer meals, free transport to and from 
            school or boarding facilities. At the tertiary level, institutions 
            may offer housing and often perform a wide range of research 
            activities. <A 
            href="http://www1.oecd.org/els/education/ei/eag/tables/B6.xls">Indicator 
            B6</A> also examines how funds are allocated to these educational 
            functions. 
            <P class=h4>Classification of expenditure 
            <P>The OECD indicators framework classifies educational expenditure 
            in three dimensions: 
            <UL>
              <LI>The first dimension - represented by the horizontal axis in 
              the diagram below - relates to the location where spending occurs. 
              Spending on schools and universities, education ministries and 
              other agencies directly involved in providing and supporting 
              education is one component of this dimension. Spending on 
              education outside these institutions is another. 
              <LI>The second dimension - represented by the vertical axis in the 
              diagram below - classifies the goods and services that are 
              purchased. Not all expenditure on educational institutions can be 
              classified as direct educational or instructional expenditure. 
              Educational institutions in many countries not only offer teaching 
              services but also various ancillary services to support students 
              and their families, such as meals, transport, housing, etc. In 
              addition, at the tertiary level spending on research and 
              development can be significant. Not all spending on educational 
              goods and services occurs within educational institutions. For 
              example, families may purchase textbooks and materials themselves 
              or seek private tutoring for their children. 
              <LI>The third dimension - represented by the colours in the 
              diagram below - distinguishes between the sources from which the 
              funds originate. These include the public sector and international 
              agencies (indicated by the light grey colour) and households and 
              other private entities (indicated by the blue colour). Where 
              private expenditure on education is subsidised by public funds, 
              this is indicated by cells in dark grey colour. The diagram is 
              reported at the beginning of each indicator to signal its 
              coverage. </LI></UL>
