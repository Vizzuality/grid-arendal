  <TR>
    <TD><FONT face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=2>Singapore is an 
      island, a city state. It has a total land area of 650 square kilometres 
      and a population of 4.1 million. With limited land and a high population 
      density, it has to meet the challenge of building a comprehensive, 
      efficient and yet environmentally acceptable land transport system. 
      <P align=left>We have done our utmost to minimize the adverse impacts of 
      an ever expanding transport network. These impacts include traffic 
      congestion, environmental pollution and the use of precious land to 
      accommodate the growing numbers of vehicles on our roads. 
      <P align=left>Singapore has implemented various strategies to bring about 
      a more efficient and environmentally less polluting land transport system 
      &#8211; including improving public transport, integrating transport needs into 
      land-use planning, managing demand for road usage and harnessing 
      technology to optimize the capacity of the island&#8217;s transport 
      infrastructure. 
      <P align=left>Providing an attractive public transport system is a key 
      thrust of Singapore&#8217;s policies. Currently about 63 per cent of all 
      motorized trips on our island are made by public transport &#8211; 5 million of 
      the total 7 million made every day, comprising 3 million on buses, 1 
      million on the mass rapid transit trains and another 1 million in taxis. 
      <P align=left>We hope that one day 75 per cent of all motorized trips on 
      our island will be made by public transport. To this end, we are seeking 
      to expand our rail transit system further. 
      <P align=left>There are at present two train networks in Singapore &#8211; the 
      <A href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/">mass rapid transit (MRT) 
      lines</A> and the <A href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/">light rapid 
      transit (LRT) system</A>. The MRT links the main population centres 
      north-south and east-west, while the LRT serves the intra-town and 
      localized transport needs of the residents of satellite townships. Another 
      57 kilometres of MRT and LRT lines will be added to the existing 91 
      kilometre network over the next five years. By integrating the two 
      networks, we are making travel by train a seamless and attractive mode of 
      transport for commuters. There are also plans to improve bus and taxi 
      services further. 
      <P align=left>A &#8216;traveller information system&#8217; is being introduced for the 
      bus service. This will provide commuters with real-time information on bus 
      movements, locations and expected arrival times, to help them plan their 
      journeys better and cut down waiting time. 
      <P align=left>At the same time, more and more taxis in Singapore are being 
      equipped with a satellite global positioning system, allowing them to be 
      directed to the nearest passenger pick-up points. The system has 
      effectively cut down customers&#8217; waiting time, while maximizing the 
      utilization of the taxi fleet. 
      <P align=left>All these are important features in making our public 
      transport system attractive and appealing to commuters. 
      <P align=left>Unpopular though they may be, tough measures are also needed 
      to moderate the ownership and use of motor vehicles in a crowded city 
      state like Singapore. We have to avoid congested roads and motorways for 
      both economic and environmental reasons. 
      <P align=left>Under our vehicle quota system a certificate of entitlement 
      (COE) must be acquired before a person can register a vehicle for use on 
      the road. The price of a COE is determined by market demand through a 
      public tendering system, and it has a validity period of ten years. By 
      limiting the number of COEs issued each month, the quota system has served 
      as an effective means to keep the growth of the vehicle population in 
      Singapore at a level of 3 per cent per year. This is a sustainable growth 
      rate, carefully calculated and based on what we can comfortably provide 
      for in terms of the amount of roads needed and the space to be set aside 
      for supporting infrastructure. An electronic road pricing system is used 
      to moderate the use of vehicles on busy roads. All vehicles in Singapore 
      are now equipped with cashcard readers. Motorists are levied a fee 
      whenever they pass through the gantry point of a busy road during peak 
      hours. All transactions are done electronically, and motorists are 
      encouraged to avoid such charges by using less busy roads, or by taking 
      public transport. This electronic system also allows us flexibility to 
      vary the charges based on traffic conditions, so that we can continually 
      optimize the use of our roads. 
      <P align=left>We have also implemented an expressway monitoring and 
      advisory system which uses detection and surveillance cameras to monitor 
      the speed and volume of traffic on expressways. The information is, in 
      turn, disseminated to motorists through electronic signboards placed at 
      strategic points. This manages peak hour traffic flow by advising 
      motorists to avoid congested expressways. 
      <P align=left>Thanks to this system, we have been able to cut down our 
      reaction time to a traffic accident on an expressway by 7 minutes to an 
      average of 15 minutes. This has significantly reduced the chances of 
      traffic building up due to road accidents, and consequently reduced air 
      pollution arising from idling and slow-moving vehicles on expressways. By 
      June 2001, the entire expressway network in Singapore will be equipped 
      with the system. <BR>

      more prone to emit pollutants. We therefore decided in September 1992 to 
      prohibit the import of any used vehicles more than three years old. This 
      has allowed us to maintain a relatively young fleet of vehicles, which are 
      both more roadworthy and less polluting. 
      <P align=left>Cars more than three years but less than ten years old are 
      required to undergo a mandatory vehicle inspection for roadworthiness 
      every 24 months; cars more than ten years old are subject to annual 
      inspections. Goods vehicles less than ten years old are also subject to 
      annual inspections while older ones must have them twice a year. 
      Motorcycles and scooters also have to be inspected every year. 
      <P align=left>Our vehicle inspection centres, which check roadworthiness, 
      also carry out tests during these mandatory inspections to ensure that the 
      exhaust emissions from all vehicles in use meet the limits set by the 
      Ministry of the Environment. Vehicles that exceed these emission limits 
      have to pass re-inspections before they are allowed back on the roads. 
      <P align=left>The Ministry of the Environment also controls air pollution 
      from vehicle exhausts by setting stringent fuel quality and vehicular 
      emission standards. Our strategy is to pre-empt any deterioration in air 
      quality as vehicle numbers grow. 
      <P align=left>We first introduced unleaded petrol in 1991 and were able to 
      completely phase out leaded petrol in Singapore by July 1998. Similarly, 
      we have been reducing the sulphur content in diesel fuel progressively 
      over the last decade. We have cut the permissible sulphur content in 
      diesel to 0.05 per cent by weight, and are moving towards ultra low 
      sulphur fuel. 
      <P align=left>Better fuel quality has, in turn, paved the way for us to 
      adopt more stringent emission standards for motor vehicles as engine 
      technology advances. Singapore currently adopts the Euro II emission 
      standards for both petrol- and diesel-driven vehicles. This pre-emptive 
      approach has helped to ensure that air quality in Singapore stays within 
      international guidelines despite a 3 per cent rise in vehicle numbers each 
      year. <BR>

            system</B></I></FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Electric vehicles 
      and hybrid ones (which use a combination of electric and diesel motors to 
      deliver energy more efficiently) hold promise as the green vehicles of 
      tomorrow, because they generate substantially lower levels of pollutants 
      than conventional vehicles. We have introduced tax incentives to narrow 
      the price difference between such vehicles and conventional ones and 
      encourage their use. 
      <P align=left>The potential environmental benefits of using electric or 
      hybrid vehicles in place of conventional vehicles are: reduced fuel 
      consumption; reduced emission of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas; reduced 
      emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, sulphur 
      dioxide and particulates; and reduced levels of noise. 
      <P align=left>From both economic and environmental standpoints, natural 
      gas is fast becoming the most important energy resource for power 
      generation and manufacturing in Singapore. We also want to promote its use 
      for transport because it is a cleaner fuel. We have started a pilot 
      project to gauge the potential of compressed natural gas buses: depending 
      on its outcome, we hope to be able to extend the use of the fuel from 
      buses to taxis. We hope to bring about cleaner and greener public 
      transport. 
      <P align=left>In highly urbanized Singapore, noise pollution from road 
      traffic and MRT/LRT trains also receives much attention. With further 
      urbanization and the widening of expressways, noise levels have been 
      gradually rising in some areas, especially those along existing 
      expressways. 
      <P align=left>We require new buildings fronting expressways, major 
      arterial roads and MRT tracks to be set back from these thoroughfares so 
      as to minimize the impact on residents. In addition, we have set noise 
      emission standards for vehicles, and are using low-noise porous asphalt to 
      pave our expressways. We have adopted noise-damped rail tracks and wheels 
      for MRT trains. Our LRT trains have rubber wheels, and we make them run on 
      concrete tracks to keep the noise level down. 
      <P align=left>Singapore is densely populated and highly urbanized. We have 
      to manage our land transport system effectively and creatively so that the 
      people need not endure high environmental stress from traffic congestion 
      and atmospheric pollution. 
      <P align=left>Over the years, by harnessing technology and planning ahead, 
      we have been able to keep road traffic free flowing and keep our living 
      environment clean and green. Looking ahead, our challenge is to constantly 
      come up with new ideas, take advantage of technological advances and 
      continue our pursuit of an environmentally sustainable land transport
