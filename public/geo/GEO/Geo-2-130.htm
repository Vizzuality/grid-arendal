      <FONT color=#3300cc size=+2>What goes down, must come up</FONT>
      <P>Groundwater is an essential and vital resource for about a quarter of 
      all Canadians. It is their sole source of water for drinking and washing, 
      for farming and manufacturing, indeed, for all their daily water needs. 
      Yet for the majority of Canadians&nbsp;— those who do not depend on 
      it&nbsp;— groundwater is a hidden resource whose value is not well 
      understood or appreciated.
      <P>Our image of Canada is of a land of sparkling lakes, rivers and 
      glaciers. Groundwater, which exists everywhere under the surface of the 
      land, is not part of this picture. Not surprisingly, therefore, concerns 
      of Canadians about water quality focus primarily on surface waters&nbsp;— 
      our lakes and rivers. The less visible, but equally important, groundwater 
      resources have received less public attention, except in regions of Canada 
      where people depend on them.
      <P><A name=protection>
      <H2>Groundwater needs protection</H2></A>
      <P>In recent years, however, a number of events affecting groundwater 
      quality have contributed to a heightened public awareness and concern 
      about the importance and vulnerability of the resource. Media reports 
      about the contamination of wells from leaking gasoline storage tanks or 
      dry cleaning solvents, and about the effects on groundwater of chemical 
      leakage from landfill or industrial waste disposal sites have raised 
      public concerns about groundwater quality. Early in 1990, chemical 
      seepage, caused by the tire fire at Hagersville, Ontario, threatened to 
      pollute groundwater supplies in that region. Newspaper reports alerted 
      area residents and helped focus attention on the problem of groundwater 
      pollution.
      <P>Even where we might not use it directly as a drinking water supply we 
      must still protect groundwater, since it will carry contaminants and 
      pollutants from the land into the lakes and rivers from which other people 
      get a large percentage of their freshwater supply.

            <CENTER>Groundwater and geology</CENTER></H2>Groundwater is also 
            important quite apart from its value as a resource or its close 
            connection with surface water supplies. Engineers must consider 
            groundwater when planning almost any kind of structure, either above 
            or below the ground. Ignoring the effect of groundwater on slope 
            stability can be both costly and dangerous. Geologists see 
            groundwater as a major force in geological change. The fluid 
            pressures exerted by groundwater, for example, play an important 
            role in the occurrence of earthquakes. Geologists also know that the 
            movement of water through underground geologic formations controls 
            the migration and the accumulation of petroleum and the formation of 
            some ore deposits.

      <H2>What is groundwater?</H2></A>
      <P>It is sometimes thought that water flows through underground rivers or 
      that it collects in underground lakes. Groundwater is not confined to only 
      a few channels or depressions in the same way that surface water is 
      concentrated in streams and lakes. Rather, it exists almost everywhere 
      underground. It is found underground in the spaces between particles of 
      rock and soil, or in crevices and cracks in rock. The water filling these 
      openings is usually within 100&nbsp;metres of the surface. Much of the 
      earth's fresh water is found in these spaces. At greater depths, because 
      of the weight of overlying rock, these openings are much smaller, and 
      therefore hold considerably smaller quantities of water. <A 
      href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/images/nature/grdwtr/a5f1e.jpg"><IMG 
      align=textTop alt="Main types of porosity" border=0 height=32 hspace=5 
      src="Geo-2-130_files/graphic.gif" vspace=5 width=32></A>
      <P>Groundwater flows slowly through water-bearing formations (aquifers) at 
      different rates. In some places, where groundwater has dissolved limestone 
      to form caverns and large openings, its rate of flow can be relatively 
      fast but this is exceptional.
      <P>Many terms are used to describe the nature and extent of the 
      groundwater resource. The level below which all the spaces are filled with 
      water is called the <EM>water table</EM>. Above the water table lies the 
      <EM>unsaturated zone</EM>. Here the spaces in the rock and soil contain 
      both air and water. Water in this zone is called <EM>soil moisture</EM>. 
      The entire region below the water table is called the <EM>saturated 
      zone</EM>, and water in this saturated zone is called 
      <EM>groundwater</EM>. <A 
      href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/images/nature/grdwtr/a5f2e.jpg"><IMG

      <P><A name=aquifer>
      <H2>What is an aquifer?</H2></A>
      <P>Although groundwater exists everywhere under the ground, some parts of 
      the saturated zone contain more water than others. An <EM>aquifer</EM> is 
      an underground formation of permeable rock or loose material which can 
      produce useful quantities of water when tapped by a well. Aquifers come in 
      all sizes. They may be small, only a few hectares in area, or very large, 
      underlying thousands of square kilometres of the earth's surface. They may 
      be only a few metres thick, or they may measure hundreds of metres from 
      top to bottom.
      <P><A name=move>
      <H2>Groundwater&nbsp;— Always on the move</H2></A>
      <P><EM>Permeable</EM> material contains interconnected cracks or spaces 
      that are both numerous enough and large enough to allow water to move 
      freely. In some permeable materials groundwater may move several metres in 
      a day; in other places, it moves only a few centimetres in a century. 
      Groundwater moves very slowly through relatively <EM>impermeable</EM> 
      materials such as clay and shale.
      <P>Groundwater scientists generally distinguish between two types of 
      aquifers in terms of the physical attributes of the aquifer: porous media 
      and fractured aquifers.
      <P><EM>Porous media</EM> are those aquifers consisting of aggregates of 
      individual particles such as sand or gravel. The groundwater occurs in and 
      moves through the openings between the individual grains. Porous media 
      where the grains are not connected to each other are considered 
      <EM>unconsolidated</EM>. If the grains are cemented together, such 
      aquifers are called <EM>consolidated</EM>. Sandstones are examples of 
      consolidated porous media.
      <P><EM>Fractured aquifers</EM> are rocks in which the groundwater moves 
      through cracks, joints or fractures in otherwise solid rock. Examples of 
      fractured aquifers include granite and basalt. Limestones are often 
      fractured aquifers, but here the cracks and fractures may be enlarged by 
      solution, forming large channels or even caverns. Limestone terrain where 
      solution has been very active is termed <EM>karst</EM>. Porous media such 
      as sandstone may become so highly cemented or recrystallized that all of 
      the original space is filled. In this case, the rock is no longer a porous 
      medium. However, if it contains cracks it can still act as a fractured 
      aquifer.
      <P>Most of the aquifers of importance to us are unconsolidated porous 
      media such as sand and gravel. Some very porous materials are not 
      permeable. Clay, for instance, has many spaces between its grains, but the 
      spaces are not large enough to permit free movement of water.
      <P>Groundwater usually flows downhill with the slope of the water table. 
      Like surface water, groundwater flows toward, and eventually drains into 
      streams, rivers, lakes and the oceans. Groundwater flow in the aquifers 
      underlying surface drainage basins, however, does not always mirror the 
      flow of water on the surface. Therefore, groundwater may move in different 
      directions below the ground than the water flowing on the surface.
      <P>Unconfined aquifers are those that are bounded by the water table. Some 
      aquifers, however, lie beneath layers of impermeable materials. These are 
      called <EM>confined aquifers</EM>, or sometimes <EM>artesian 
      aquifers</EM>. A well in such an aquifer is called an <EM>artesian 
      well</EM>. The water in these wells rises higher than the top of the 
      aquifer because of confining pressure. If the water level rises above the 
      ground surface a <EM>flowing artesian well</EM> occurs. The 
      <EM>piezometric surface</EM> is the level to which the water in an 
      artesian aquifer will rise. <A

            <CENTER>Groundwater as a source of energy</CENTER></H2>Groundwater 
            may be used as a source of heat. Ground source heat pumps are 
            receiving increased attention as energy efficient commercial and 
            residential heating/cooling systems. Although initial costs are 
            higher than air source systems&nbsp;— due to the additional costs of 
            the underground installations&nbsp;— the much greater energy 
            efficiency of ground source systems makes them increasingly 
            attractive.
            <P>Research into the use of geothermal water has been carried out in 
            a number of institutions across Canada. The City of Moose Jaw has 
            developed a geothermal heating system for a public swimming pool and 
            recreational facility. Carleton University in Ottawa already uses 
            groundwater to heat and cool its buildings. The Health Centre 
            complex in Sussex, New Brunswick, has been utilizing an aquifer for 
            thermal energy storage since 1995.

      <H2>Groundwater&nbsp;— A major link in the hydrologic cycle</H2></A>
      <P>Groundwater circulates as part of the hydrologic cycle. As 
      precipitation and other surface water sources recharge the groundwater it 
      drains steadily, and sometimes very slowly, towards its discharge point.
      <P>Groundwater does not stay underground forever, and it does not lie 
      still waiting for us to draw it from a well. The <EM>hydrologic cycle</EM> 
      is the series of transformations that occur in the circulation of water 
      from the atmosphere onto the surface and into the subsurface regions of 
      the earth, and then back from the surface to the atmosphere. Precipitation 
      becomes surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater. Groundwater 
      circulates back to the surface, and from the surface all water returns to 
      the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. <A 
      href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/images/nature/grdwtr/hydrologic.jpg"><IMG 
      align=textTop alt="The hydrologic cycle" border=0 height=32 hspace=5 
      src="Geo-2-130_files/graphic.gif" vspace=5 width=32></A>
      <P>When precipitation falls on the land surface, part of the water runs 
      off into the lakes and rivers. Some of the water from melting snow and 
      from rainfall seeps into the soil and percolates into the saturated zone. 
      This process is called recharge (<A 
      href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/images/nature/grdwtr/a5f2e.jpg">Figure 
      2</A>). Places where recharge occurs are referred to as <EM>recharge 
      areas</EM>.
      <P>Eventually, this water reappears above the ground. This is called 
      <EM>discharge</EM>. Groundwater may flow into streams, rivers, marshes, 
      lakes and oceans, or it may discharge in the form of <EM>springs</EM> and 
      flowing wells.
      <P>Groundwater discharge can contribute significantly to surface water 
      flow. In dry periods, the flow of some streams may be supplied entirely by 
      groundwater. At all times of the year, in fact, the nature of underground 
      formations has a profound effect on the volume of surface runoff. While 
      the rate of discharge determines the volume of water moving from the 
      saturated zone into streams, the rate of recharge determines the volume of 
      water running over the surface. When it rains, for instance, the volume of 
      water running into streams and rivers depends on how much rainfall the 
      underground materials can absorb. When there is more water on the surface 
      than can be absorbed into the groundwater zone, it runs off into streams 
      and lakes.
      <P><A name=residence></A>The <EM>residence time</EM> of groundwater, i.e., 
      the length of time water spends in the groundwater portion of the 
      hydrologic cycle, varies enormously. Water may spend as little as days or 
      weeks underground, or as much as 10&nbsp;000 or more years. Residence 
      times of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of years are not unusual. By

      width=32></A><BR>Approximately two thirds, or five million, of these users 
      live in rural areas. In many areas, wells produce more reliable and less 
      expensive water supplies than those obtained from nearby lakes, rivers and 
      streams. The remaining two million users are located primarily in smaller 
      municipalities where groundwater provides the primary source for their 
      water supply systems. For instance, 100% of Prince Edward Island's 
      population and over 60% of the population of New Brunswick and the Yukon 
      Territory rely on groundwater to meet their domestic needs.
      <P>Furthermore, the predominant use of groundwater varies by province. In 
      Ontario, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Yukon, the largest 
      users of groundwater are municipalities; in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and 
      Manitoba, the agricultural industry for livestock watering; in British 
      Columbia, Quebec and the Northwest Territories, industry; and in 
      Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, rural domestic use. Prince Edward Island is 
      almost totally dependent on groundwater for all its uses.
      <P>According to some estimates, the quantity of groundwater in the earth 
      would cover the entire surface of the globe to a depth of 120&nbsp;metres. 
      By contrast, the volume of surface water in lakes, rivers, reservoirs and 
      swamps could be contained in a depth of about one quarter of a metre.
      <P>It is extremely difficult to estimate the volume of groundwater on the 
      entire planet. For example, a recent review of the literature revealed 
      estimated figures ranging from 7&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;to 
      330&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;cubic kilometres. However, all the estimates 
      imply that if we do not include the water frozen in ice caps, glaciers and 
      permanent snow, groundwater makes up almost the entire volume of the 
      earth's usable <EM>fresh</EM> water. Yet, this supply is often not easily 
      accessible, and it may be difficult and expensive to develop these water 
      supplies in some regions. The quality of the groundwater source is also a 
      significant determining factor when identifying its use. <A

      <H2>Groundwater quality</H2></A>
      <P>We often think of water quality as a matter of taste, clarity and 
      odour, and in terms of other properties which determine whether water is 
      fit for drinking. For other uses different properties may be important. 
      Most of these properties depend on the kinds of substances that are 
      dissolved or suspended in the water. Water for most industrial uses, for 
      instance, must not be corrosive and must not contain dissolved solids that 
      might precipitate on the surfaces of machinery and equipment.
      <P>Pure water is tasteless and odourless. A molecule of water contains 
      only hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Water is never found in a pure state in 
      nature. Both groundwater and surface water may contain many constituents, 
      including microorganisms, gases, inorganic and organic materials.
      <P>The chemical nature of water continually evolves as it moves through 
      the hydrologic cycle. The kinds of chemical constituents found in 
      groundwater depend, in part, on the chemistry of the precipitation and 
      recharge water. Near coastlines, precipitation contains higher 
      concentrations of sodium chloride, and downwind of industrial areas, 
      airborne sulphur and nitrogen compounds make precipitation acidic.
      <P>One of the most important natural changes in groundwater chemistry 
      occurs in the soil. Soils contain high concentrations of carbon dioxide 
      which dissolves in the groundwater, creating a weak acid capable of 
      dissolving many silicate minerals. In its passage from recharge to 
      discharge area, groundwater may dissolve substances it encounters or it 
      may deposit some of its constituents along the way. The eventual quality 
      of the groundwater depends on temperature and pressure conditions, on the 
      kinds of rock and soil formations through which the groundwater flows, and 
      possibly on the residence time. In general, faster flowing water dissolves 
      less material. Groundwater, of course, carries with it any soluble 
      contaminants which it encounters.

      <P>Scientists assess <EM>water quality</EM> by measuring the amounts of 
      the various constituents contained in the water. These amounts are often

      number of grams of a substance per million grams of water.
      <P>The suitability of water for a given use depends on many factors such 
      as hardness, salinity and pH. Acceptable values for each of these 
      parameters for any given use depend on the use, not on the source of the

        300&nbsp;000&nbsp;mg/L in some deep saline waters in the Interior 
        Plains.</LI></OL>At any given location, groundwater tends to be harder and 
      more saline than surface water, but this is by no means a universal rule. 
      It is also generally the case that groundwater becomes more saline with 
      increasing depth, but again, there are many exceptions.

            in large numbers in the 1950s and 1960s have become corroded. Before 
            1980, most underground tanks were made of steel. Without adequate

            <P>Groundwater dissolves many different compounds, and most of these 
            substances have the potential to contaminate large quantities of 
            water. For example, one litre of gasoline can contaminate 
            1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;litres of groundwater. This problem is 
            particularly severe in the Atlantic provinces where there is a high 
            usage of groundwater. In many cases, the problem is noticed long 
            after the aquifer is contaminated, for example, when consumers start 
            tasting or smelling gasoline

      <P>As groundwater flows through an aquifer it is naturally filtered. This 
      filtering, combined with the long residence time underground, means that 
      groundwater is usually free from disease-causing microorganisms. A source 
      of contamination close to a well, however, can defeat these natural

      <P>Groundwater contaminants come from two categories of sources: <EM>point 
      sources</EM> and distributed, or <EM>non-point sources</EM>. Landfills, 
      leaking gasoline storage tanks, leaking septic tanks, and accidental 
      spills are examples of point sources. Infiltration from farm land treated 
      with pesticides and fertilizers is an example of a non-point source.
      <P>Among the more significant point sources are municipal landfills and 
      industrial waste disposal sites. When either of these occur in or near 
      sand and gravel aquifers, the potential for widespread contamination is 
      the greatest.
      <P>In Ville Mercier, Quebec, for example, the disposal of industrial 
      wastes into lagoons in an old gravel pit over many years rendered the 
      water supplies of thousands of residents in the region unusable. Water had 
      to be pumped from a well 10&nbsp;kilometres away to replace the area's 
      supply.
      <P>Other point sources are individually less significant, but they occur 
      in large numbers all across the country. Some of these dangerous and 
      widespread sources of contamination are septic tanks, leaks and spills of 
      petroleum products and of dense industrial organic liquids.
      <P>Septic systems are designed so that some of the sewage is degraded in 
      the tank and some is degraded and absorbed by the surrounding sand and 
      subsoil. Contaminants that may enter groundwater from septic systems 
      include bacteria, viruses, detergents, and household cleaners. These can 
      create serious contamination problems. Despite the fact that septic tanks 
      and cesspools are known sources of contaminants, they are poorly monitored 
      and very little studied.
      <P>Contamination can render groundwater unsuitable for use. Although the 
      overall extent of the problem across Canada is unknown, many individual 
      cases of contamination have been investigated such as Ville Mercier in 
      Quebec; the highway de-icing salt problem in Nova Scotia; industrial 
      effluents in Elmira, Ontario; various pesticides in the Prairie provinces; 
      industrial contamination in Vancouver, British Columbia; and so on. In 
      many cases, contamination is recognized only after groundwater users have 
      been exposed to potential health risks. The cost of cleaning up 
      contaminated water supplies is usually extremely high.
      <P>Contamination problems are increasing in Canada primarily because of 
      the large and growing number of toxic compounds used in industry and 
      agriculture. In rural Canada, scientists suspect that many household wells 
      are contaminated by substances from such common sources as septic systems, 
      underground tanks, used motor oil, road salt, fertilizer, pesticides, and 
      livestock wastes. Scientists also predict that in the next few decades 
      more contaminated aquifers will be discovered, new contaminants will be 
      identified, and more contaminated groundwater will be discharged into 
      wetlands, streams and lakes.
      <P>Once an aquifer is contaminated, it may be unusable for decades. The 
      residence time, as noted earlier, can be anywhere from two weeks or 
      10&nbsp;000&nbsp;years.
      <P>Furthermore, the effects of groundwater contamination do not end with 
      the loss of well-water supplies. Several studies have documented the 
      migration of contaminants from disposal or spill sites to nearby lakes and 
      rivers as this groundwater passes through the hydrologic cycle, but the 
      processes are not as yet well understood. In Canada, pollution of surface 
      water by groundwater is probably at least as serious as the contamination 
      of groundwater supplies. Preventing contamination in the first place is by 
      far the most practical solution to the problem. This can be accomplished 
      by the adoption of effective groundwater management practices by 
      governments, industries and all Canadians. Although progress is being made 
      in this direction, efforts are hampered by a serious shortage of 
      groundwater experts and a general lack of knowledge about how groundwater 
      behaves.
      <P><A name=engineer>
      <H2>Groundwater and engineering</H2></A>
      <P>Groundwater can also have dramatic implications for engineering and 
      geotechnical studies. The study of groundwater is essential for engineers 
      who construct dams, tunnels, water conveyance channels, mines, and other 
      structures. Groundwater must be considered whenever the stability of 
      slopes is important, whether the slope is natural or constructed. 
      Groundwater must also be taken into account when devising measures to 
      control flooding. In all of these situations, groundwater flow and fluid 
      pressure can create serious <EM>geotechnical problems</EM>.
      <P>Groundwater, for example, may create structural weaknesses in dams, or 
      it may flow underground right around the structure as it did at the Jerome 
      Dam in Idaho. Water flowed so efficiently through the rock formations 
      surrounding the reservoir that the dam would hold no water, even though it 
      was structurally sound.
      <P>In another case, when geological exploration was being carried out in 
      preparation for the construction of the Revelstoke Dam in British 
      Columbia, geologists and engineers were concerned about an old landslide 
      on the bank of the proposed reservoir. They suspected that the water held 
      in the reservoir could increase groundwater pressures enough to make the 
      slide unstable. The solution was to increase drainage around the slide to 
      ensure that groundwater pressures did not increase. In 1963, these same 
      conditions at the Vaiont reservoir in Italy caused a slide which killed 
      2500&nbsp;people.
      <P>Other problems result from the excessive use of groundwater. 
      <EM>Overdrafting</EM> occurs when people draw water out of an aquifer 
      faster than nature can replenish it. The most obvious problem created is a 
      shortage of water. Overdrafting, however, can also create significant 
      geotechnical problems. Although not an issue in Canada, at many locations 
      around the world overdrafting has caused <EM>land subsidence</EM>. This 
      can produce severe engineering difficulties. Parts of Mexico City, for 
      instance, have subsided as much as 10&nbsp;metres in the past 
      70&nbsp;years, resulting in a host of problems in its water supply and 
      sewerage system. Land subsidence may also occur when the water table is 
      lowered by drainage. In the early 1970s, for example, an entire 
      residential subdivision in Ottawa subsided when a collector sewer was 
      constructed nearby. The subsidence seriously damaged the residents' 
      property.

      <H2>Safeguarding our groundwater supply</H2></A>
      <P>Groundwater is an essential resource. It exists everywhere under the 
      Canadian landscape and is vitally connected to our rich surface water 
      resources.
      <P>Contamination of groundwater is a serious problem in Canada. Industrial 
      and agricultural activities are major sources of contaminants, but 
      Canadian households are equally important sources.
      <P>Groundwater moves so slowly that problems take a long time to appear. 
      Because of this, and because it is so expensive to clean up a contaminated 
      aquifer (if it can be done at all), it is preferable by far to prevent 
      contamination from happening in the first place. For example, leaking 
      underground storage tanks can be replaced by tanks that will not corrode; 
      landfills can be sited in locations where leachates will not contaminate 
      underlying groundwater; and the impacts of spills of hazardous materials 
      reduced by restricting access to recharge areas.
      <P>All levels of government in Canada are starting to take some of the 
      actions necessary to protect our groundwater supplies, but there is a long 
      way to go before these measures are fully effective. At the same time, 
      universities and government research institutes are investigating what 
      happens to water underground and what can be done to preserve it and even 
      improve its availability to us. Both as a society and as individuals, we 
      must keep in mind groundwater's susceptibility to contamination.
      <P>Groundwater is just as important as the sparkling lakes and rivers of 
      our postcard image of Canada. This national treasure may be "hidden," but 
      it must not be forgotten.
