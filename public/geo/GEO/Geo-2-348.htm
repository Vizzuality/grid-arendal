<P>The alarming pictures of the disastrous floodings of the River Oder in the 
summer of 1997 recalled the last great floodings of the Rhine in 1993 and 1995. 
What happened on the Oder was what people were afraid of in the Dutch Rhine 
delta in January 1995, but did luckily not happen there. At different locations 
the dikes along the River Oder did not resist the enormous water pressure. Large 
areas were flooded in Czechia, Poland and to a lesser extent in Germany. More 
than 100 people lost their lives, flood damages amounted to billions of ECU. The 
population reacted with an unprecedented wave of solidarity for the flood 
victims.</P>
<P>Floodings and flood damages remain present-day problems. It is well-known 
that man has increased the risk of river floodings due to hydraulic 
interventions, intensive building activities and the use of all areas in the 
vicinity of rivers. To aggravate the situation, today’s knowledge on the effects 
of climatic changes points out that there will probably be a general rise of 
risks from floodings in the next century, thus including the Rhine. Improved 
flood prevention and protection remain indispensable and will in future be more 
in demand than ever.</P>
<P>On January 22, 1998 the 12<SUP>th</SUP> Conference of Rhine Ministers adopted 
the "Action Plan on Flood Defence" in Rotterdam, implying expenses of up to 12 
billion ECU. This Action Plan aimed at the improvement of precautionary flood 
protection will be implemented within the next twenty years.</P>
<P>For the first time there is international demand to give considerably more 
expanse to the Rhine in case of floodings. In the course of the last two 
centuries the Rhine lost more than 85% of its natural alluvial areas, as man 
used them for settlements or agriculture. Present countermeasures, such as the 
assignment of alluvial areas, their preservation and expansion and improved 
water storage in the entire catchment area must simultaneously aim at an 
ecological improvement of the Rhine, its valley and its catchment area. </P>
<P>But man must again learn to live with floodings. According to current 
estimates, the total assets possibly affected in areas at flood risk may amount 
to about 1500 billion ECU. In future, if floodplains cannot be kept free, flood 
risks must be taken into account when fixing land use and spatial planning 
projects. Risk awareness must be improved and private precaution by people, 
trade and industry must be strengthened. This is a good means of avoiding or 
reducing damages by adapted constructions in areas which are normally protected 
but nevertheless at risk of extreme floodings. The new Atlas of the Rhine 
presents the flood-prone areas and thus the problems related to floodings.</P>
<P>The most important targets of the Action Plan on Flood Defence are to reduce 
damages up to 10 % by the year 2005 and up to 25 % by 2020. Extreme flood levels 
downstream of the regulated Upper Rhine are to be reduced up to 30 cm by 2005 
and up to 70 cm by 2020. These ambitious targets can only be reached if all 
flood protection protagonists will closely and constructively co-operate. The 
hitherto practised sector based way of thinking must be replaced by integrated 
reflection and action on a local, regional, national and international scale. 
First of all, the policy areas related to water management, spatial planning, 
nature protection, agriculture and forestry are concerned.</P>
<P>On January 22, 1998 the Rhine-Ministers explicitly asked all those 
responsible to implement the necessary flood preventing measures with priority, 
even in times of financial bottlenecks.</P>
<P>Therefore, I am quite confident that the Action Plan on Flood Defence will be 
rapidly implemented and that it will be understood as a great forward-looking 
target which can only be accomplished in solidarity. Let us actively begin with 
this great task and bear in mind that any action must go hand in hand with a 
great sense of responsibility for all those people in the Rhine basin.</P>
<P>Time will show whether we are capable of preventive and concerted reflection 
and action.</P>
