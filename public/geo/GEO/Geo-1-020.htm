<CENTER></CENTER>
<P>Texts contributed by participants in a COCTA panel on <STRONG>globalization 
</STRONG>to be held during the World Sociology Congress in Montreal, July 1998, 
provide the data for an analysis of key concepts used in research on this topic. 
Among those who offer a conspectus of this concept are Christopher Chase-Dunn, 
Jeff Hart, George Modelski, Richard Tardanico and Majid Tehranian -- as quoted 
below. 
<P>Readers are invited to help develop this hypertext set of linked concepts by 
sending comments directly to the authors of individual texts or by writing 
everyone on GLOBE-L. To see who is included, take a look at the list. Our 
expectation is that by the time we meet in Montreal at the ISA Congress in July 
1998 we will not only have clarified many important concepts <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/shelt.htm">sheltered</A> <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/power/sld002.htm">*</A>under the word, 
'globalization,' but also reached some consensus about the tags that can most 
conveniently be used to represent them (note: asterisks offer links to 
slides).&nbsp;

<EM>Globalization is a process that has been going on for the past 5000 years, 
but it has significantly accelerated since the demise of the Soviet Union in 
1991.<A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glocon.htm#T1">1</A> Elements of 
globalization include transborder capital, labor, management, news, images, and 
data flows.<A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glocon.htm#T2">2</A>The main 
engines of globalization are the transnational corporations (TNCs), 
transnational media organizations (TMCs), intergovernmental organizations 
(IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and alternative government 
organizations (AGOs). From a humanist perspective, globalization entails both 
positive and negative consequences: it is both narrowing and widening the income 
gaps among and within nations, intensifying and diminishing political 
domination, and homogenizing and pluralizing cultural identities.<A

<EM>...globalization is a process along four dimensions: economic globalization, 
formation of world opinion, democratization, and political globalization. This 
was rounded off with the assertion that changes along one of these dimensions 
(such as economic globalization) elicited changes among the other 
dimensions.</EM>&nbsp;<A name=CHASE-DUNN></A> 
<P><STRONG><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#CHASE-DUNN">Chase-Dunn:</A></STRONG><EM>During 
the late 1980s a new term entered popular discourse: globalization. Instead of 
clarifying issues of world development the buzzword rather seemed to add 
confusion and misunderstandings. There are at least five different dimensions of 
globalization that need to be distinguished:</EM>

  </LI></UL>
<P><EM>While the earlier popular discourse on globalization seemed to suggest-at 
least implicitly-that globalization and world economic growth occur in tandem, a 
closer look reveals that the various aspects of globalization became accentuated 
in the phase of long term sluggish economic growth (1973-1992) as compared with 
the earlier long term economic upswing (1950-1973)... Adjectives such as 
"uneven" and "limits" have increasingly appeared in the titles of academic works 
on globalization. This not only reflects a critical stance, but also the obvious 
need for theoretical clarity and empirical research...</EM> <EM>How are the 
different aspects of globalization related to one another?</EM>&nbsp;<A

<EM>. . . A starting point is recognition of the heuristic nature of the concept 
of [global] "restructuring," as commonly used in the burgeoning literature on 
the reordering of the world economy during the late twentieth century. . . The 
concept refers to basic, more-or-less rapid change in the technical, social, 
political, and territorial organization of investment, production, trade, and 
aid. Among the shifts most commonly identified are the transnationalization of 
communication, commerce, production, ownership, consumption, sociocultural 
reproduction, and politics; the increased segmentation and volatility of market 
demand; the organizational decentralization of firms and the enhanced 
flexibility of production; the strategic ascendance of finance capital and 
specialized services relative to manufacturing; the transfer of public resources 
to private hands; the proportional relocation of manufacturing activity from the 
United States and Western Europe to East Asia as well as poor geographic areas; 
and deterioration in the average pay, stability, and other conditions of 
employment.</EM>&nbsp;<A name=HART></A> 
<P>Jeffrey <A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#HART">Hart</A> 
has identified five concepts represented by <EM>globalization</EM> which he 
lists as follows: 
<P><STRONG><EM>~~~ (1) the existence of a global infrastructure;</EM></STRONG> 
<BR><STRONG><EM>~~~ (2) global harmonization or convergence of some important 
characteristic feature;</EM></STRONG> <BR><STRONG><EM>~~~ (3) 
borderlessness;</EM></STRONG> <BR><STRONG><EM>~~~ (4) global diffusion of some 
initially localized phenomenon; and</EM></STRONG> <BR><STRONG><EM>~~~ (5) 
geographical dispersion of core competences in some highly desirable 
activities.</EM></STRONG>&nbsp; 
<HR>
It will be easier to talk about these different aspects of globalization if we 
have specific terms for each concept, and if we can put them in some logically 
coherent framework. In this background paper, we will propose such a context, 
identify and provide terms for each concept, while offering examples of their 
utilization in the full texts that may be viewed at: <A

<P><STRONG>Contemporary globalization can be viewed as just the latest phase of 
a long-term process, and if we accept the existence of many world-systems 
located in different parts of our planet, we can see that globalization could 
have occurred in each of them, and that our contemporary world-system is truly 
planetary. Put differently, whatever happens, happens somewhere in a time/space 
continuum. Consequently, we need concepts that provide a time/space context for 
understanding the processes of globalization. However, our vocabulary gives us 
no convenient terms for viewing time/space as a single holistic context of 
action. Instead, we look at time/space as though its two major dimensions could 
be separated and our language reflects this analytic perspective when we talk 
about time<EM> </EM>andspace. Academically, we have partitioned this concept 
into History and Geography. Despite this artificiality, we have no choice but to 
develop separate temporal and spatial concepts to look at these two aspects of 
time/space. When we do that, we might come up with the following notions -- 
please remember this is just a first draft and readers are urged to think about 
and suggest better options.&nbsp;<A name=T1></A> </STRONG>

<HR>
<STRONG>#1A. TIME: Chronology. Using Tehranian's <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#TEHRANIAN">text </A>as a 
starting point, we can begin with his first sentence which reads: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><EM>[1a] Globalization is a process that has been going on for the 
past 5000 years, but it has significantly accelerated since the demise of the 
Soviet Union in 1991.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>This sentence distinguishes between a long-term historical 
perspective on globalization and a contemporary one. Phrases in the sentence 
provide the basis for identifying two sub-concepts described by Tehranian as 
follows: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><EM>[1a.1] a process that has been going on for the past 5000 years, 
</EM>and </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><EM>[1a.2] a process that has accelerated since... 1991</EM> 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>To refer to these concepts precisely, we need descriptive texts like 
these, but it is inconvenient to keep repeating a text whenever we want to refer 
frequently to a concept. If we could substitute a word or short phrase, it would 
make it much easier to say what we mean and be understood. We usually refer to 
such concept handles or labels as terms, but since this word is often also used 
to mean a concept -- i.e., the concept it represents -- it can be ambiguous. 
Instead, therefore, I shall use a different word, tag, which is never confused 
with a concept. Tags are meaningless items (symbols, words, pictures, or 
objects) that enable one to find something of value to which they are attached. 
Tags have no intrinsic meaning, but they can identify concepts such as those 
described above in [1a.1] and [1a.2]. Here are some possible tags for each of 
them: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Consider the following possibilities: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. 
1a.1, 1a.2 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. 
historical globalization, contemporary globalization 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. 
primoglo, contoglo 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. HG or 
HiG; CG or CoG </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Each item in this list suggests a different kind of tag that can be 
used for these two concepts. We don't have to choose among them because each can 
be used as a synonym to mean exactly the same thing. However, each takes a form 
that has different advantages and drawbacks. One can select any of them after 
considering their tradeoffs. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Among the four types of tags illustrated above, consider that the 
first involves the use of an arbitrary symbol that has absolutely no intrinsic 
meaning. However, in context, it can quite precisely designate a concept. Out of 
context, 1a.1 could mean anything, but here, it can represent the concept 
described in [1a.1]. So long as the context is apparent, such tags are 
convenient but as soon as the context is removed, they become meaningless. A 
completely meaningless word, like <EM>blob</EM> would do as well. For use 
anywhere but right here, therefore, we cannot use such a tag. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The second tag is a descriptive phrase and it is pretty intelligible 
-- on its face, we can easily remember that historical globalization refers to a 
long-term process going back thousands of years, but contemporary globalization 
represents the latest phase of this process, e.g., since 1991. Although these 
phrases are clear and have face validity, they are lengthy and frequent 
repetition makes them clumsy. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>We may wish we had a short form for the same concept. If we were 
willing to accept neologisms, as illustrated in the third item, we might try 
coining a word -- e.g., <EM>primoglo</EM> for [1a.1] and <EM>contoglo</EM>for 
[1b]. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>A fourth possibility is to use an abbreviation: e.g., <EM>HG</EM> for 
[1a.1] and <EM>CG</EM> for [1a.2]. Some people prefer acronyms, i.e., 
pronounceable abbreviations -- .e.g <EM>HiG</EM> and <EM>CoG</EM> in place of HG 
and CG.&nbsp; Here I will use <EM>glo</EM>. as an abbreviation for 
globalization, but in combining forms, I will omit the "." as seen here in 
'chronoglo' and 'contoglo'. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Each tag has its advantages and disadvantages, but all of them can 
represent the same concept, they are therefore equivalents (synonyms). None of 
them are "terms" with already establilshed meanings and we cannot, therefore, 
view these forms as "concepts" -- but as tags they can identify concepts.&nbsp; 
Among them, the neologisms are succinct and pretty easy to remember but they are 
likely to offend purists who reject such coinages out of hand as inelegant and 
not permissible in serious writings. It's O.K. for a Jabberwockyto invent words 
like slithy and borogove, but not for ordinary scholars. Well, perhaps 
abbreviations are more acceptable -- but sometimes they are hard to remember -- 
even harder than neologisms. HG could mean Heavy Going, whereas it's hard to 
think of another meaning for histoglobal. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The four tags suggested for each concept illustrate several 
possibilities -- we don't have to choose among them because each can be used as 
a synonym to mean exactly the same thing. However, each takes a form that has 
different advantages and drawbacks. One can select any of them after considering 
their tradeoffs -- and, of course, one can use two or more 
<EM>pleonastically</EM>as by placing a synonym in parentheses to indicate that 
it has the same meaning as another expression. For example, for [1a.1] I might 
write "...historical globalization (HG) ..." to show that these are two tags for 
the same concept. In fact, this is a common practice as when we write 
"International Sociological Association (ISA)" or "gross national produce 
(GNP)". </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>However, the choice of tags is optional and those who don't like one 
type can choose another. If we think of a <EM>concept record </EM>as a record 
that first describes a concept and then lists tags available to represent it, we 
will have a format open to the listing of different tags for any concept -- no 
one of them need be "standardized" -- the only important question is whether 
they can be remembered and understood. Consider the two following records: 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG><EM>[1a.1] a process that has been going on for the past 5000 
years:</EM>&nbsp; 1a.1, historical globalization,&nbsp;<A 
name=primoglo></A>primoglo, HG </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><EM>[1a.2] a process that has accelerated since the demise of the 
Soviet Union:</EM>&nbsp; 1a.2, contemporary globalization,&nbsp;<A 
name=contoglo></A>contoglo, CG, COG </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>An important point to remember is that whereas we often debate the 
meanings of terms -- globalization is an example -- tags have no intrinsic 
meanings to debate. They merely point to a concept description and offer two 
options: </STRONG>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone who rejects a tag can simply propose a 
    better one;</STRONG> 
    <LI><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone who faults a description because it 
    fails to identify a useful concept can write another description that 
    identifies a better concept.</STRONG> </LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp; In neither case will disputes about the proper meanings of a 
"term" arise. Note that I have not used the word, <EM>definition</EM>, above. We 
often speak about "defining concepts" but the phrase is a oxymoron. Only words 
or things can be defined, not concepts -- references to a "definition" imply the 
prior existence of a term or object to be defined. By contrast, we can "describe 
concepts" by specifying their essential characteristics -- i.e., those 
attributes that are needed in order to say that something is a concept. In 
[1a.1] such attributes are <EM>being a process</EM> and having a <EM>long-term 
status. </EM>The existence of a concept does not depend on its being the 
definition of anything, a term or an object -- concepts are created by their 
descriptions -- they are neither true nor false, real or unreal, but they may 
well be useful or useless. Their utility depends on whatever use we make of them 
and we can simply ignore useless concepts -- there is no reason to fight them. 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Describing concepts permits us to escape a trap that provokes 
fruitless disputes when we argue that a definition is "wrong" and should be 
"corrected." In [1a.1], for example, if we thought of "historical globalization" 
as a term and tried to define it, we might argue that although the process is 
old, it did not begin 5000 years ago. Rather, we might claim, it started 6000 or 
4000 years ago. Since, in fact, "historical" carries no chronological 
implications, it is never right or wrong to claim that history started at any 
given date. Decisions about when to date a process can be specified in a concept 
definition, and we could easily imagine different texts for [1a.1] each 
stipulating a different starting date. No one of them would be a better or worse 
definition of "historical," but each would be a different concept. If we wanted 
to use several such marginally different concepts, we could make our intentions 
clear by using 100 tags for each of them, as represented by [1a.0-9] or however 
many tags seemed useful. No doubt most of the concepts that we can imagine or 
describe are useless, but that does not mean that they are not concepts. Indeed, 
I think that most of the concepts we could create are indeed useless and 
deserved neglect will sweep them into an historical dustbin -- don't fight them, 
just ignore them. The important challenge is to identify significant concepts by 
describing them, and then to find suitable tags to designate them. As for 
However, if we really don't care when, exactly, the process started, we could 
settle for a single tag and change the concept description to a vaguer 
criterion, e.g., "something like 5 millennia ago." Concepts, it appears, are 
never true or false, but they can be more or less useful in constructing 
theories and writing descriptions. Moreover, some are necessary if we want to 
think clearly about a subject, but we can only use them efficiently if we have 
convenient ways to represent them. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Looking again at the tags listed under [1a.1] and [1a.2], notice that 
each set contains a neologism. The aversion to neologisms is so powerful among 
social scientists that, unlike natural scientists, they hamper their own efforts 
to identify and designate new concepts. As a result they either use long phrases 
or, quite often, stipulate a new meaning for a familiar word. This practice is 
really reprehensible, in my opinion, because it produces ambiguity -- all 
established words already have meanings that can easily be confused with any new 
meanings one may assign to a word. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Admittedly, when the new meaning occurs in a radically different 
context, it is not difficult to distinguish between the old and the new senses 
of a word. Consider <EM>mouse </EM>which I am now using for a gadget that helps 
me control my computer. However, this new meaning is easily distinguished by 
context from its older meanings, like that of a household rodent. Unfortunately, 
when social scientists assign a new meaning to a familiar word, the old and new 
contexts are so similar that ambiguity is almost unavoidable. Among the tags for 
new concepts suggested here, you will not find any <EM>noviterms, </EM>the tag I 
use to represent any established word for which a new meaning is proposed. 
However, I will in most cases suggest a <EM>neologism, </EM>by which I mean a 
newly coined word. Of course, familiar words will be suggested for established 
concepts. However, a great many concepts needed to develop our understandings of 
globalization are, indeed, quite new, which justifies the creation of 
neologisms. However, in every such case a phrase composed of familiar words will 
also be mentioned and users may select either (or both) as they prefer. 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>To conclude this discussion of temporal concepts of globalization, 
let me mention the problem of hierarchic levels. More generic concepts link more 
specific concepts and we do need different tags to distinguish between levels. 
If we think of contoglo and primoglo as terms for contemporary and pre-modern 
globalization, then do we not need a higher level concept to include both? How 
about <EM>chronoglo</EM>, a concept that could be described as </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[1] the process of globalization viewed chronologically, i.e., in all 
possible time periods: 1, globalization any time,&nbsp;<A 
name=chronoglo></A>chronoglo, GAT&nbsp;<A name=BENTLEY></A> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Jerry <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#BENTLEY">Bentley: </A>had such 
a concept in mind when he supported: <EM>a general definition that works for all 
relevant times and places, then periodizing and recognizing dynamics at work 
that are susceptible to analysis.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[Bentley also identified:] <EM>Some notable turning points in the 
history of globalization include the following, although this is by no means an 
exclusive list: the migration of *Homo erectus* from Africa some 500,000 to 
1,000,000 years ago; the domestication of horses and the invention of stout 
watercraft about 4000 B.C.E.; the invention of the wheel about 3500 B.C.E.; the 
domestication of camels after 3000 B.C.E.; the establishment of well traveled 
sea lanes in the Indian Ocean after 500 B.C.E.; the opening of the silk roads 
about 200 B.C.E.; the spread of epidemic diseases throughout the eastern 
hemisphere after 200 C.E.; the establishment of permanent contacts between the 
eastern hemisphere, the western hemisphere, and Oceania after 1492; the founding 
of global trading companies after 1600; the development of modern transportation 
and communication technologies after industrialization; and the emergence of 
transnational corporations and an integrated global economy in the twentieth 
century.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Could we say that although <EM>chronoglo</EM> can support a very 
broad dichotomy, such as between <EM>primoglo</EM> and <EM>contoglo</EM>, it can 
also provide a context for more specific periodizations, such as those proposed 
by Bentley? Categories like his will be useful for historians whereas most 
social scientists may find the dichotomous scheme adequate for their purposes. 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>However, the general rubric provided by <EM>chronoglo</EM> is also 
contextual for theorists who reject all dating of stages as inherently arbitrary 
or factitious. Indeed, the generic concept enables them to criticize any scheme 
for stages or periods as arbitrary by contrast with cyclical notions or 
pulsations viewed as a better way to understand the processes of globalization 
throughout time. Perhaps the two perspectives can be linked in a helical 
metaphor that combines short-term cycles with long-term fundamental trends. This 
seems to be what <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/mlinar.htm">Mlinar</A>and Albrow had in mind 
when characterizing <EM>process </EM>as a pattern of historical change that 
<EM>...elides the difference between open-ended transformations and repeatable, 
predictable sequences.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Remember that concepts are never true or false -- we need only ask 
whether or not they are useful as tools in our analysis, and it is useful to be 
able to identify the concepts we reject. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Let us now turn to some spatial aspects of the time/space continuum. 
</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>#1B. SPACE: Locus. We sometimes use <EM>locus </EM>very broadly to refer 
to any place where something happens and I suggest that we use it here for the 
generic concept: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[1B] the geographic location of any global system or its 
sub-systems:&nbsp;<A name=locus></A>locus </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Some might think that "location" would be preferable because it is a 
more familiar word. However, <EM>location</EM> usually points only to a local 
place, and we may think of such locations<EM> </EM>as including villages, 
cities, towns, and districts. At the opposite extreme, the largest locus on 
Earth is the <EM>planet</EM>. No doubt, our planet is the locus of the 
contemporary world-system, but the locus of pre-modern world systems (before 
1500 AD) was, I think, always sub-planetary. Would it not be useful to have a 
concept that could be described as: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[1B.1] The <EM>locus</EM> of any world-system, i.e., the farthest 
reaches of all interactions within that system: global locus,&nbsp;<A 
name=glocus></A>glocus, GL </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Note that in this concept description the word, <EM>locus</EM>, is 
marked to show that it designates a concept described elsewhere in this 
glossary. We can refer to all such marked words within a concept definition as 
<EM>entailments</EM>. The use of entailed words and phrases enables us to show 
how certain concepts are related to each other, especially to link generic 
concepts with more specific ones. In this case, the maximum extent of any locus 
within a world-system is its glocus, i.e., its fully globalized geographic 
extent in that system.. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The glocus of a word-system need not be very large. For example, 
prior to European contact, the Hawaiian Islands constituted a world-system, and, 
although the glocus of this system included the whole archipelago, that was only 
a small part of the world. For several thousand years there has been a vast 
world-system whose glocus extended throughout the Afro-Eurasian continent, but 
it did not include the Western hemisphere. However, this continental system 
became linked with the Americas during the 16<SUP>th</SUP>century, leading to 
the creation of a truly planetary glocus.&nbsp;<A name=plocus></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>[1B.15] the locus of a world-system that includes the whole planet: 
planetary locus, plocus </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>This usage involves a distinction between global and planetary -- 
anything that involves all of Earth as a member of our solar system is 
<EM>planetary</EM>, a special case of a glocus. We need to make this distinction 
if we want to use "'global" to think of historical globalization as going back 
several thousand years. Prior to the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century, the glocus of our 
planet's largest world-system was only hemispheric, but since them, it has 
become planetary. Put differently, the globalization of earlier world-systems 
was sub-planetary, but contemporary globalization is now planetary. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>At the opposite extreme, spatially, of any glocus are an innumerable 
set of locations that we may characterize as <EM>local. </EM>Unfortunately, our 
thoughts about locations are usually parochial in the sense that they pay 
scarcely any attention to relations between localities and their environment. 
When they do dwell on such interactions, they are normally limited to such 
sub-global entities as individuals, groups, communities, states or "societies" 
(vaguely defined) as local entities, although specialists on civilizations (or 
cultural spheres) do look at how the norms of a "civilization" impinge on its 
member communities. Increasingly, we need to think of locations in global terms, 
suggesting the use of this concept:&nbsp;<A name=glocality></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>[1B.2] the locus of any sub-system of a world-system: globally 
interactive locality, GIL, glocality, </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>In this usage, cities. Regions and states can be glocalities, as well 
as villages and individuals. We might add special terms for the various types of 
glocalities ranging from individual and parochial to urban, regional, state, and 
even civilizational. However, it seems unnecessary to try to do that here. 
Instead, let us look at some texts that illustrate the use of glocality to 
glocus. .&nbsp;<A name=MILANI></A> </STRONG>

<P><STRONG><EM>Within "global trends", the processes involved are thought to 
connect individuals to large-scale systems as part of complex dialectics of 
change at both the local and global poles... In as much as the local and the 
global shape the circumstance of our daily lives, the crux of the matter is not 
one of awarding empirical or theoretical priority to the one above the other. 
Rather, one is to insist on the local, the global and other relevant (but 
perpetually shifting) geographical scale levels which are the result, the 
product of socio-spatial change.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>We can now recognize that world-systems affect every locality 
contained within them and, reciprocally, localities may, at least potentially, 
influence the world-systems in which they are located. In order to underline 
such a focus on the glocal as a point of interaction with the global, we might 
well use <EM>glocality </EM>to talk about any locality in its global 
context.&nbsp;<A name=MCBRIDE></A></STRONG>

they respond to Glocalization.</EM>&nbsp;<A name=HERRMANN></A></STRONG>

Glocalization is mainly approached by looking at single issues like economic 
changes, ways of political negotiation etc.. And closely connected with this is 
the limitation on an institutional point of view. Then - perhaps - changes in 
values are considered. But what really matters is the holistic change in 
soci(et)al realms... This is only a frame for processes for strengthening local 
and regional and not least personal ways of exclusion and inclusion, 
participation and passiveness etc.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The use of "glocality" enables us to distinguish between localities 
thought of as though they could exist independently of their world-system. 
Admittedly we often see them as shaped by the region, state, or civilization in 
which they find themselves, but glocalities, by definition, are viewed as 
interactive with the world-systems in which they are located in. In this usage, 
<EM>glocus </EM>points to the macro-level locus of a world-system, and 
<EM>glocality </EM>to any of its local sub-systems. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>All glocalities within a world system are not homogeneous -- indeed, 
vast differences between them are consistent with their interdependence with a 
world-system. It is tempting to generalize about major regions, like "first," 
"second," and "third" world, or continental/insular, temperate/tropical, 
desert/sown, rural/urban. All such distinctions are relevant provided they are 
not viewed simplistically. Knauder's work in Mozambique provides a context for 
him to offer the following generalizations -- and for us to ask whether 
glocalization has similar of different effects elsewhere.&nbsp;<A

rural areas... As main causes of poverty, the process of deglobalization, the 
structural adjustment programmes and the failure of rural development programmes 
are discussed and possible solutions suggested.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Another way to situate the local/global interface involves the 
transformation of groups. Traditionally we think of small groups as inherently 
local because they hinge on face-to-face interactions. Today, small groups can 
include members scattered anywhere in the world because their identity is based 
on the virtual interactiveness of computer technology and the internet. Since 
individuals can link many such groups, information has replaced territoriality 
as the primary basis for social interaction as glocuses replace localities 
throughout our world-system. Here is a text that voices this perception: 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/mlinar.htm">Mlinar</A>: 
<EM>...expanding accessibility both necessitates and enables increasing 
selectivity which results in the formation of various groups, organizations or

<P><STRONG>Although we associate time and space with History and Geography, 
these disciplines increasingly merge as the time/space parameters of action lose 
their force. Meanwhile, other disciplines also respond to new dimensions of 
globalization that we need to bring within the scope of this inquiry. </STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Because most of us have been schooled in such academic disciplines as 
History and Geography -- as well as Sociology, Economics, Psychology, 
Anthropology, Political Science, Communications, etc. -- we tend to focus on 
selected dimension of globalization that interest us because they relate to our 
fields of specialization and the discourse communities which become our frames 
of reference. Indeed, we may even equate globalization with one of these 
dimensions -- for example with the global import of trade, money markets, and 
multi-national corporations as an economic aspect of globalization, with 
international organizations, world politics and peace/war a political dimension, 
with problems of nationalism, ethnicity, race and religion as social or cultural 
aspects, and with the flow of information, the mass media, and the internet as 
communications and information in global contexts. Such concerns are reflected 
in this text:&nbsp;<A name=T2></A><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#TEHRANIAN">Tehranian</A>: 
<EM>Elements of globalization include transborder capital, labor, management, 
news, images, and data flows.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>In these sentences the author points to selected dimensions of 
globalization but he could have extended the list substantially by reference to 
more disciplines. Depending on our disciplinary orientations and the particular 
facets of globalization we find interesting, we often equate some aspect or 
dimension of the process with the whole pattern. Indeed, it is truly difficult 
to study globalization in a holistic perspective -- it is both easier and more 
gratifying to slice off some aspect of the whole and look at it as though it 
encompassed the global pattern. As I see it, we do need all these different 
perspectives. Even a house can scarcely be viewed as a whole -- we can look at 
it from the front, back, side, overhead or inside. Each view is different, yet 
we understand that they are all aspects of a single house. It is more difficult 
for us to see how every dimension of globalization is just one part of a vast 
interactive system. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The selection of aspects of a complex system to view as though they 
embraced all its parts is conditioned by the force of our academic disciplines 
which give us different vantage points for looking at globalization. They 
provide us with categories (lenses) and concepts through which to take the snap 
shots that create the diverse montages which, in our minds, form the complex 
global system found in our world today. Since we can scarcely imagine any other 
lenses through which to look at the world, these orientations are predictable 
and perhaps unavoidable. Yet we could perhaps acquire a more skeptical vantage 
point to deal with the phenomena of globalization if we remembered the 
peculiarly parochial nature of a way of looking at the world that has evolved 
only recently in our universities. Analyses like those of the Gulbenkian 
Commission Report, chaired by Immanuel Wallerstein, ISA President, have 
identified some of the historical forces that generated the particular criteria 
and distinctions of the modern social sciences. His call for reforms rests, in 
large part, on the major changes that contemporary globalization has wrought in 
our world. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>It is premature to speculate about what new images or categories any 
future re-structuring of social science will, indeed, bring about, but they 
will, no doubt, give us tools for handling significant dimensions of 
globalization that we are now neglecting. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Having said that, we can nevertheless take one step toward 
clarification by describing and tagging the major dimensions of our globalized 
world-system that, in a sense, constitute its most salient threads. Let us 
consider how they might identify facets of globalization as each discipline 
looks at them. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>To start with, History and Geography provide frameworks that focus on 
the temporal and spatial dimensions of globalization -- as noted above. However, 
each discipline provides a wealth of analytic information that goes far beyond 
their time/space platforms. Indeed, they are rich with descriptions and 
theoretical analyses that help us understand the dynamics, the causes and 
consequences, of the whole canvas of globalization. It is useful to have a 
technical term for each disciplinary dimension, starting with: </STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>[2A] the dimension of globalization that focuses on its historical 
dimensions: historical world-systems,&nbsp;<A name=histoglobal></A>histoglobal 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>First, please distinguish between chronoglo and histoglobal: the 
former is a matter of dating periods of globalization and the latter involves 
analysis of events and relations that occurred during any such period. A further 
distinction is made between the adjectival form of disciplinary perspectives on 
world-systems as illustrated by 'histoglobal,' and the substantive form of 
non-disciplinary characterizations of a world-system as illustrated by 
'chronoglo,' used as a noun formed with an abbreviation, <EM>glo</EM>., standing 
for <EM>globalization</EM>. To illustrate a histoglobal perspective, consider 
the following comments by Gundar Frank.&nbsp;<A name=FRANK></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#FRANK">Frank</A>:&nbsp; 
...<EM>globalism [even more than globalization] was a fact of life already since 
at least 1500 for the whole world... the AfroEurasian "ecumene" or "central 
world system" functioned as a single unit already long before that... historical 
continuity has been far more important than any and all dis-continuities. The 
perception of a major new departure, which allegedly spells a dis-continuous 
break in world history, is substantially [mis] informed by a Eurocentric vantage 
point... we are badly equipped to confront our one world reality when we are 
mis-guided into thinking that our world is only just now undergoing a belated 
process of "globalization." Our very language and its categories reflect and in 
turn mis-guide our thinking... short of inventing an entirely new vocabulary 
that would be unfamiliar to the reader, I am obliged to make do with received 
terminology... We also need global analysis and theory... the conventional 
notion of 'diverse cultures' being 'penetrated' by emergent universalist forces 
is misfounded.... The difference is continuously forming at the same time and in 
formative connection with more obviously integrational developments ....</EM> 
</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>Frank's ideas are also impregnated with geographical contexts for which 
we might want this concept: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[2B] the dimension of globalization that focuses on its geographic 
dimensions: geoglobal perspective,&nbsp;<A name=geoglobal></A>geoglobal 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The adjectival form used here presupposes a linked noun like 
<EM>dimension </EM>or<EM> perspective.</EM>, but we can use the word by itself 
as just short form of the whole idiom. Among the geographic concepts needed in 
discourse on globalization are those involving cities and villages, states and 
regions. An example taken from Henry Teune reads:<A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/teune2.htm">Teune</A>: <EM>The political 
system of the world is now made up of two conflicting systems, one of cities and 
political communities within them as well as their organizations and 
associations with counterparts in other countries in a global political economy 
and the other the international system of states -- the new and the old. The 
elite of the first is a loose association of business leaders trained in a 
common curriculum, professionals with various knowledge and amusement based 
activities, and regional and local public officials dealing with problems of 
transportation, education, the environment; that of the second are national 
political party leaders, trade union officials, military officers... New forms 
of political community are being formed in urban places -- neighborhood 
organizations, residential associations, affinity based residential blocks or 
areas... Industrial and research parks offer life-styles as well as work. 
Economic organizations take on political activities, supporting political 
parties or candidates or "volunteering" to help others.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Concurrently with the rise of macro-level and nomothetic studies that 
seek to generalize about contemporary phenomena we see an increase in the number 
of micro-level and idiographic inquiries in the specific details of life in 
particular localities. Thus social science disciplines and multi-disciplinary 
area studies are increasingly anchored in geographic frameworks that provide a 
comprehensive context for global studies. </STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>Sociology offers a perspective based on social action, how people relate 
to each other at diverse levels. Could we think of this as <EM>socioglobal 
--</EM> not a holistic image of globalization but a very important aspect that 
takes into account all the dimensions of social interaction?&nbsp;<A

<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/mlinar.htm">Mlinar</A> : 
Sociology is one of the last of the social sciences to take up the subject of

society, as the society with the highest level of complexity. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>A related text stressing the norms and patterns that control

disruptions, is the following:&nbsp;<A name=GILL></A> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#GILL">Gill: 
</A><EM>Globalization is contributing to the emergence of a differently 
constituted self and social morality: a self and a social morality which no 
longer needs to situate itself within a progress narrative. Yet, because 
globalization is an ambivalent and uneven process, some sections of the society 
are feeling cheated and displaced by change and are increasingly attracted to 
right-wing and fundamentalist ideas and movements which want to return to old 
certainties. So, the episode is also making new social divisions apparent: 
namely, that between those favoured and those threatened by globalization. Will 
those who are now able to feel shame for the racism of white Australians be 
blind to the plight of those materially and spiritually threatened by 
globalization?</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>Perhaps Gill could add a reference here to the response of Aboriginal 
Australians to globalization, a theme that <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glocon.htm#CELEBI">Celebi</A>points to in 
his text quoted below. As these two texts also illustrate, the social and 
psychological are so enmeshed it may be arbitrary to split them -- a fact made 
clear in the literature on "social-psychology" which could, of course, be 
separated out for recognition as another dimension of globalization.

franca," notably English and a few other international languages that enable 
large numbers of educated persons around the world to communicate with each

sensitivity to the values inherent in many languages as cultural vehicles and 
the efforts that are made to promote the survival and use of these languages.

<P><STRONG>To respond to this question, my impression is that in addition to the 
growing use of a global language, we will also see increased interest in the 
preservation of local languages and even the standardization of dialects (such

diversity will augment residual diversity in language as in many other cultural

territorial social and political systems, residences, with the proper names of 
individuals attached to them, are among the most fixed physical locational 
coordinates in the world of states. Precise locations in social and now 
electronic spaces are now also common. Unlike most human-physical spatial 
coordinates... social and electronic spaces require temporal coordinates, 
including movement both in time and in physical space. People change jobs, join 
different organizations, connect to more than one electronic system, and travel.

<P><STRONG>The neologisms suggested above can be avoided by using phrases , but 
they can also help us identify a wide range of dimensions of globalization, each 
of which is highly interdependent on all the others. The important point to 
emphasize is that globalization includes all these dimensions, plus others not 
mentioned here. The point is that if we equate any of them with globalization we 
are reifying, we are thinking of part of something as a whole. In a systemic 
context, all parts affect the whole and are affected by it. If we see 
globalization as a holistic process with many dimensions, then each dimension 
mentioned above has links with all the others. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>To see and understand such a vastly complex whole, especially when it 
has so recently escalated in scope and impact, we need to identify and relate to 
each of its parts and try to understand their relations with the whole. We also 
need to see how arbitrary and parochial (based on our Eurocentric world view) 
are the disciplinary categories we use to identify the parts. I think we have no 
viable alternative to the use the established disciplines as distorting windows 
on any concrete system -- especially a global system. If we think of this 
conventional perspective as provisional, can we not also remain sensitive to the 
likelihood that new and more useful categories will present themselves and we 
should then be able to jettison old concepts in favor of better and more useful 
ones. As a start, however, we can begin by using familiar notions as a kind of 
scaffold on which to construct a new edifice that can more suitably represent 
globalization as a holistic process or system. </STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Some important concepts can help us see links between all the 
dimensions of globalization identified above are the generic notions of 
<EM>function </EM>and<EM> structure</EM>. Sometimes we combine these two notions 
in a single term, <EM>structural/functional, </EM>but here let me separate them 
and speak separately about each. </STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>#3A<A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/power/sld006.htm">*</A>. 
Functions. Looking back at the texts offered in [1a.1] and [1a.2], we can see 
that they are incomplete -- they specify a <EM>process </EM>without mentioning 
what the process is. To complete these defining texts we need to add a phrase 
that will read something like "a global process." This </STRONG><STRONG>phrase 
contains two words, each of which limits the applicability of the other. More 
specifically, global specifies a context and process many related functions, 
i.e., relationships between different items. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Among such relationships is a crucial one involving causes and 
effects -- however, we need to view them as continuously interactive or circular 
rather than as linear. That is to say, we are less interested in looking at the 
"causes" of globalization and its "consequences" as independent variables, than 
in seeing how they are interdependent. Usually two complementary processes occur 
interactively: a given cause produces some effects, but these effects, 
reciprocally, influence their causes. Our preoccupation with "independent" and 
"dependent" variables reflects an underlying linear way of thinking that hampers 
any understanding of globalization. Nevertheless, we also need to see how the 
opposite sides of a circle flow into each other. This means that it is still 
useful to think about what "causes" and "results" from globalization. We already 
have a convenient term for the causal processes which we may think of as&nbsp;<A 
name=globalizing></A>globalizing, normally viewed as an intransitive verb, but 
Sonntag cites its transitive use, as in the phrase, "We [in the West] will 
globalize you [in the Third World]" -- will this term replace "westernizing"? 
She views globalizing as:&nbsp;<A name=SONNTAG></A> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#SONNTAG">Sonntag</A>: <EM>...an 
on-going historical process that is reaching its apex toward the end of the 20th 
century. This process leads to the increasing integration of the production of 
goods, services, ideas, culture, communication and environmental pollution on a 
world-wide scale, impacting the locality of populations and labor. The political 
response (e.g., World Trade Organization, NAFTA, IMF/World Bank) to this 
integration by governments (national, sub-national and international) is 
frequently at variance with the social response of civil society (e.g., changing 
social constructions of identity, points of resistance among subaltern groups), 
often leading to violence and war.</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>The responses Sonntag mentions as feed-back reactions or some 
consequences of globalization lack any convenient designator. No doubt the 
phrase, <EM>consequences of globalization</EM>, can be viewed as a tag for the 
process, and if we were to use it often, we might create an acronym like 
<EM>COG</EM> to designate it. I prefer a short phrase like <EM>global impact 
</EM>or even a coinage like <EM>globalating. </EM>This neologism can easily be 
formed by using -<EM>ate</EM>as a verbal suffix, a form familiar in such words 
as <EM>separate, precipitate, </EM>and<EM> eventuate. </EM>If we were willing to 
accept to <EM>globalate</EM>as a verb meaning to produce something as a result 
of globalization, we could then conveniently say that globalizing and 
globalating are the complementary and interactive aspects of globalization, each 
being continuously affected by the other. If the word offends, however, we may 
continue to look for other words -- the important point is that we need to 
recognize and examine the continuously interactive cause/effect functions of 
globalization. Moreover, it is important to recognize the dynamics of such 
interactions -- they may provoke negative (backwash) effects as in vicious 
circles or enhance positive (spread) effects as in benign circles.<A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/power/sld007.htm">*</A> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Perhaps some examples will clarify this point: the INTERNET is 
clearly a technoglobalizing cause of globalization, but its widespread use is 
also a technoglobating consequence. The ability of individuals located anywhere 
in the world to communicate across state boundaries quickly and efficiently 
enhances their ability to affect global processes, while simultaneously these 
processes promote the development and use of cyberspace. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Parallels can be found in pre-modern times. Jerry Bentley, for 
example, points out text that the invention of sailing ships was historically 
globalizing. He could have added that the expansion of commerce and migration 
made possible by sailing ships also had the effect of causing more such ships to 
be built and sailed. However, the fact that globalization involves the 
concurrent and interactive processes (causes and effects) of globalizing and 
globalating does not mean that we ought to obscure these complementary functions 
-- indeed, to understand globalization we need to be able to think about how 
they functions reciprocally affect each other. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Consider, for example, the phenomena already discussed under the 
heading of another neologism, <EM>glocalization</EM>. This term has already 
gained moderate acceptance as a portmanteau word that somehow links the global 
with the local. However, we are not always very clear about how they are linked. 
I see them as having an interactive cause/effect relationships. These 
relationships arise in virtually all the dimensions specified above. Consider, 
for example, how technoglobalizing and technoglobalating reciprocally affect the 
global and local. I mention the INTERNET yet many other technologies could 
equally well be analyzed in this context, in association with each of the global 
dimensions. Consider, for example, the ethnoglobal concerns of indigenous 
peoples who, for generations, found themselves isolated as helpless victims of 
colonizing conquerors. Today they are mobilizing as a result of globalating 
forces that enable them to understand and deal with their plight by means of new 
technologies, including the use of the INTERNET to enable them to establish 
working relations with many other indigenous communities widely scattered 
throughout the world. One advantage of mentioning the INTERNET is that readers 
can very easily find examples to see how this is happening. Go, for North 
American examples, to <A 
href="http://hanksville.phast.umass.edu/misc/NAresources.html">Native Americans 
</A>; and see <A 
href="http://www.halcyon.com/FWDP/wwwvl/indig-vl.html">Indigenous Studies 
</A>for a global view of their web sites. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Since sites on the INTERNET are cross-linked in many channels, it may 
not make much difference where one starts -- eventually, a vast canvas will 
unroll in which one can see how innumerable indigenous communities are now 
articulating their activities and concerns and linking them with the parallel 
interests of other indigenous communities, something they could scarcely ever do 
with more conventional technics. They are now able, to offer inputs to the 
network based on their local situation and, reciprocally, they are affected by 
what they learn about the parallel concerns of other communities. These concerns 
involve all the dimensions noted above -- political, social, cultural, health, 
psychological, linguistic, environmental, religious, etc. Just as each affects 
the others, so every indigenous locality contributes a globalizing thrust, and 
receives globalating influences. Perhaps we do not need to distinguish them from 
each other because, as a pattern or process, they are part of a seamless 
cause/effect interactive flood. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>These processes can also be viewed from many perspectives, the 
interactive disciplinary dimensions. In the econoglobal perspective, for 
example, consider how individual entrepreneurs and professionals, working at 
home, can participate in the development, production, distribution, and 
consumption of an infinitely wide array of goods and services distributed 
throughout the world. Political activists involved in every possible cause and 
public policy issue are able to find sympathizers anywhere in the world, join 
forces with them to fight their causes and, of course, to be influenced by 
others who share their concerns. At the psychoglobal level, individuals can now 
become socialized by globalating forces and resources, starting at an early age, 
so as to develop all kinds of personal interests, skills, perspectives, 
activities that, in turn, enable them to become globalizing influences anywhere 
in the world, making use of the INTERNET in conjunction with a growing range of 
our resources to promote their personal and social interests or concerns. Web 
Sites could be listed here to provide vivid examples of all these dimensions and 
levels of interaction, but it would be tediously redundant to do so here. 
Perhaps a more concrete approach oriented to a specific problem would better 
illustrate globalization as a continuously interactive phenomenon. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=-1>A current television documentary focuses attention on 
the situation in one American village that has long suffered from a lack of 
medical services caused by the reluctance of American physicians to locate 
themselves in rural localities both because they risk encounters with baffling 
health problems and because they expect to receive less income than they could 
secure in more urban settings. Hospitals and clinics that offer a wealth of 
technical and professional resources enable them to feel better about themselves 
and to make more money.</FONT> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=-1>To help overcome this problem, the U.S. government 
adopted a policy which permitted foreign students who had come to medical 
schools in the United States to extend their visas if they would accept 
appointments in rural and inner city settings generally avoided by American 
physicians. In the documentary we meet an Indian doctor who has graciously and 
effectively served a remote rural community -- he want to remain and his 
community is eager for him to stay on, but the American Medical Association 
increasingly presses for restrictions that will enhance opportunities for their 
members who allegedly now have difficulty finding suitable appointments and 
would willingly go to localities now served by foreign doctors. Such a simple 
situation raises a host of questions that link the local and global in a 
functional complex. The vitaglobal implications involving medical and health 
questions around the world are only the most conspicuous aspects of this story 
which ignores such matters as how traditional health practices interface with 
modern medicine.</FONT> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=-1>The political and legal issues concern the rights and 
limitations of foreign professionals working outside their original homelands, 
and they link localities with state and national governments and 
inter-governmental agencies such as the World Health Organization. The 
econoglobal aspects concern the conditions of employment of professionals 
working in different countries and localities, as well as the availability of 
health services to people living in diverse settings. The documentary pointed to 
intra-American aspects of this story but one might equally look to the 
consequences in India where the loss of health professionals because of the 
brain drain might also be studied.</FONT> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The ethnoglobal aspect arises from issues affecting cross-cultural 
relations between locals and foreigners living in city slums and parochial 
villages. The documentary, incidentally, portrays these relations as universally 
harmonious. The psychoglobal dimensions could be explored by looking at the 
personal lives of both the foreign doctors and their patients as they interact 
over long periods. A sociologist might invoke the pattern variables identified 
by Talcott Parsons to see how universalistic or particularistic, how specific or 
diffuse, how ascriptive or achievement oriented, etc. are the behaviors found in 
such situations. No doubt a post-modernist would be able to deconstruct all 
these simplistic ideas, but if so, what newer notions would be invoked? In the 
globalist perspective, whatever they may be, they will need to be anchored in 
the growing interdependence between globalizing and globalating functions in the 
contemporary world scene. </STRONG>

Structures. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Although we normally think of globalization as a planetary 
phenomenon, that is only because the contemporary world-system has become 
planetary. When we think of globalization historically, we may turn our 
attention to a qualitative distinction that can apply to any world-system, no 
matter how broad or limited its locus might be -- whether a string of Pacific 
Islands, or a vast Afro-EurAsian continent. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Historically, regardless of locus, globalization has always involved 
qualitative changes in the relationships among the components of a any 
world-system. We may think of each such component as a <EM>thread</EM>, using 
the metaphor of a <EM>fabric </EM>to represent the whole. The threads of any 
world-system, in this sense, include the goods, people, power, information and 
values (money) that are exchanged by its members. However, these threads may be 
very loosely woven as in a fish net, or tightly meshed as in a piece of denim. 
When the main links between China and Rome involved long-distance camel caravans 
traveling over Central Asia, or junks and dhows sailing the Indian Ocean, we can 
think of the system as loosely netted or having low density. By contrast, in 
today's world, air travel and cyberspace permit the modern network of global 
linkages to be extremely dense. Of course, these are contraries, not 
contradictories -- any system can be more or less dense, a variable with many 
intermediate degrees and while the polar extremes are rare. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The point, of course, is that globalization can refer not only to the 
geographic extent of a world-system, but also the degree of density of 
interactions within its glocus. Pulsations within a world-system may be 
associated with increasing and decreasing density of interactions as a function, 
perhaps, of rising and falling hegemonies. I don' want to discuss any such 
substantive propositions here, however. Rather, the conceptual point that 
contemporary globalization involves not only the planetization of our 
world-system but also a gigantic leap in the density of its interactions. This 
may be associated with de-hegemonization -- but that's not a question I'm 
prepared to debate. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The conceptual point is that, in addition to the global scale of 
contemporary globalization, we need to think about its functional density -- how 
loosely or tightly woven are the threads in its fabric. We may well assume that 
although contemporary globalization is marked by its planetary scale, this is 
not unique, having existed at least since the 16<SUP>th</SUP>century. More 
significantly, the contemporary world-system is composed of threads that are 
more and more tightly interwoven. We need to think about the degrees of density 
of interactions within a world-system, but what words are available to help us. 
Could we, for example, speak of <EM>inter-globalization</EM>? Unfortunately, 
this term suggest interactions between systems rather than between the parts of 
a system. Could we use <EM>juxtapose, </EM>a verb that means "to place close 
together"? If so, we might use the form, <EM>juxta</EM>which, in Latin, means 
"side by side" to create a neologism, <EM>juxtaglo, </EM>to refer to the degree 
of density of the components of a global system. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>We do need to distinguish between the geographic scale of any 
world-system and the degree of density of interactions among its components -- 
and <EM>globalization</EM>may carry both connotations but its main sense is that 
of locus, the planetary extent of its domain. However, much more importantly in 
today's world, the degree of interactiveness of the interwoven threads of 
contemporary life may well be a far more significant feature. To highlight this 
feature of contemporary globalization, could we not add this concept:&nbsp;<A 
name=juxtaglo></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>[3A] the extent to which the components of a global system are 
interwoven: juxtaglo </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The increasing juxtaposition of factors as globalization increases is 
recognized in the following excerpt from the announcement of the </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/BIELEFELD">Bielefeld 
Prize:</A><EM>The growing simultaneity of world events creates new forms of 
social dynamics on a global scale, including financial markets, the spreading of 
innovations, public opinion, international politics, and life styles. These 
again affect national and local structures and create new opportunities through 
channels often unknown and poorly analyzed.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>To extend our vocabulary for talking about how juxtaglobal (densely 
compacted) a world-system is, we might add another variable to talk about the 
quality of interactions, using conflict and harmony as polar opposites. In some 
cases, densely interactive elements are harmoniously meshed, but by contrast, 
they can be tightly locked in violent struggles. We sometimes think of 
<EM>organize </EM>as a verb connoting interactive qualities: thus to organize is 
to link elements in a manageable pattern or structure, whereas to 
<EM>disorganize </EM>involves antagonistic or chaotic relationships. It is easy 
enough to conceptual the ideal types of a world order (as in an organized world 
federation) and world disorder (as in pervasive anarchy). As noted above, 
however, these are contraries (not contradictories). In the real world we 
typically find intermediate conditions of (dis)organization, and this seems to 
me to characterize our contemporary world system. In other words, contemporary 
globalization involves a mixture of order and disorder. How shall we think and 
talk about it? </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Until the 1990s, and so long as state-centered images of the world 
system seemed reasonable, we could and did conceptualize the world as a 
multi-state system that could be multi-polar, bi-polar, or unipolar in 
structure. These terms presupposed the salience of states and ignored non-state 
actors, but since the end of the Cold War and the rise of non-state ethnic 
nations, to say nothing of multi-national corporations, inter-governmental and 
non-governmental organizations, and powerful cross-national gangs, we have come 
to see the world as a more complex mixture of different kinds of entities, only 
some of which are states. We can also see that although most of their 
interactions involve cooperation based on negotiated agreements and mutual 
accommodation, many tense conflicts also arise although, I believe, none of them 
will involve "world (global) wars," such as we have experience in the recent 
past. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The available polar contrasts -- order and anarchy -- do not provide 
useful options to talk about the contemporary (and probable future) condition of 
our world-system. Perhaps instead we should think about order andanarchy -- how 
can we represent systems in which they are mixed? </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Even the words that suggest mixtures -- hybrid, pluralism, diversity, 
blend, medley, potpourri, stew, etc. -- all have other meanings and suggest 
random rather than structured disorder. We need, I think, a concept that 
suggests </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[3B] a global pattern of densely juztaposed structures able to 
negotiate agreements for mutual accommodation but vulnerable to endemic disorder 
wherever conflicting interests lead to violent conflict:&nbsp;<A 
name=syntropy></A>syntropy. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>This seems to be what Martin Albrow had in mind, as reflected in the 
following text from </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/mlinar.htm">Mlinar</A>: 
[Albrow] <EM>...introduces the concept of the "Global Age" as an age of 
globality, that is, a new level of organization "to which any agent can relate, 
but which has no organising agent... Yet the lack of central organisation is not 
disintegration." (p.121).</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>It seems to me that this concept aptly characterizes today's global 
system and is likely to remain relevant for an indefinite period. It could 
evolve toward a more highly organized world federation with the ever-present 
risk of world tyranny, or toward a more loosely structured world disorder marked 
by endemic violence and anarchy. Clearly a syntropic global system has many 
positive and negative characteristics, it represents the contemporary 
world-in-place rather than an imaginary world-in-theory. As such it gives us a 
way to talk about the internal structures of globalization rather than its 
planetary locus. It may also give us a tool to help put our thoughts and wishes 
about the world into a more helpful perspective. Something like this is involved 
in the following text: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/mlinar.htm">Mlinar</A>: 
<EM>Globalization implies both increasing autonomy of actors in terms of their 
expanding range of choice as well as increasing dependency on society as a 
whole. The autonomy of actors increases as their independence decreases. In 
other words, the process of globalization implies the transition from autonomy 
with exclusion (autarchy) to autonomy with inclusion [capability].</EM></STRONG> 

<P><STRONG>Another way to think about such apparent contradictions is to focus 
on the parameters rather than the consequences of globalization: the enhanced 
technological capabilities of today's world means that the capacity of 
individuals and groups to act in highly differentiated (diversified) ways is 
simultaneously subject to the growing restraints imposed by interdependence and 
the need for discipline -- apparently contradictory results are necessary 
consequences of a single cause. Our world-system became planetary in the 
16<SUP>th</SUP> century, but it has become juxtaglobal (densely interactive) 
only since the elaboration of electronics and the development of the INTERNET. 
It would have been easier to identify the distinctive features of the 
contemporary phase of globalization if we had not used "global" or even 
"planetary" as descriptive metaphors. Those who think of recent developments as 
a product of the "information" revolution are on a better track, but even that 
notion may suggest too limited a perspective. The information revolution has, I 
think, supported a far more densely juxtaposed structure of all social 
relationships in the contemporary world than whatever happened earlier. 
Actually, I would prefer a term based on <EM>syntropy</EM>-- a "syntropic 
world-system," perhaps? </STRONG>

  understanding of what is real or merely conceptualized. Do we just construct 
  images of globalization, or do the phenomena really exist?&nbsp; Ontological 
  questions reflect differences in the way we try to understand the world. A 
  familiar contrast distinguishes deduction from induction. When we try to make 
  sense out of our observations, we are proceeding inductively to create images 
  of the real world -- the images are not necessarily true, of course, but they 
  reflect our impressions of what exists or makes sense in the real world, the 
  world outside ourselves. By contrast, deductive images are constructed by 
  logical inference -- starting from certain premises we link concepts in a 
  rational way to create ideal types.</STRONG> 
  <LI><STRONG>The second is normative, a perspective that invites us to become 
  explicit about our values and ideologies -- what do we treasure or abhore, and 
  how does that affect our thoughts about globalization?&nbsp; It involves 
  questions of good and bad, positive and negative, what we admire and value by 
  contrast with what we abhor and detest.</STRONG> 
  <LI><STRONG>A third is paradigmatic, involving theoretical commitments that 
  affect how we understand anything, the fundamental questions we ask or the 
  assumptions we make.&nbsp; One such perspective is evolutionary insofar as it 
  detects dynamic processes that generate change and set limits on what is 
  possible without assuming the presence of any particular direction or causal 
  force outside these processes. Another paradigmatic commitment is ecological, 
  supposing interdependence among all elements in a system and anticipating 
  negative of positive feedback processes that promote stability or lead to 
  chaos and systemic breakdowns.&nbsp; A third possibility sees no ordering of 
  events but only random and accidental outcomes that are completely 
  unpredictable by contast with a fourth,&nbsp; fully teleological perspective 
  that postulates supernatural interventions leading to predetermined 
  outcomes.</STRONG> </LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;Let us look at each of these perspectives or points of view 
separately and then ask how they affect each other. </STRONG>

<STRONG>#4A<A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/power/sld010.htm">*</A>. The 
Ontological Dimension.</STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>Subjectively speaking, there are two important ways to think about 
what we see and understand about the world: the deductive and the inductive. The 
first relies heavily on reasoning, on syllogisms and logic, to link ideas into 
patters that appear to us to have some explanatory import. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The philosophical term, ontology, may help us here -- it is concerned 
with questions about existence, about appearances as contrasted with reality. 
Those who emphasize deductive reasons are likely to construct ideal types, 
viewed as models or constructs that help us understand the world. By contrast, 
those who stress inductive analysis are disposed to begin with observations and 
try to combine them in patters that help them see and explain phenomena in the 
real world. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Without trying to explain all the subtleties of ontology and 
metaphysics, perhaps we can use a simplistic impression of this notion to help 
us grasp important concepts of globalization. Some, like ideal types, are 
socially constructed images about the world and what is happening to it. They 
relay heavily on possibilities and idealizations and tend to exaggerate our 
hopes and fears. Optimists construct ideal types of a globalizing world as 
something that can fulfil their hopes and make the world a better place for all 
of us. By contrast, pessimists are likely to construct nightmare visions of 
horrible scenarios in which our worst fears are actualized. However, ideal types 
can also be quite neutral: a familiar example is the notion of a circle which, 
as defined in Geometry, is an ideal type, but as drawn on a page is a reality. 
Hopefully, there is some resemblance between the two, but normally the visible 
circle on a page has imperfections that do not characterize the invisible notion 
of a circle as an abstract concept.&nbsp;<A name=MISINA></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#MISINA">Misina</A>:<EM>I make 
an argument for a two-fold distinction [involving] the concept of globalization 
- on the one hand, globalization as a substantive and, on the other, 
globalization as a conceptual phenomenon. Broadly, globalization as the 
substantive phenomenon refers to a set of social, political, economic, and 
cultural processes ...which have given rise to ever increasing 
interconnectedness and interdependence of the world, to its transformation from 
the world-in-itself to the world-for-itself; as a conceptualphenomenon, 
globalization has to do with various forms of interpreting, or 
theorizing...[about] the process of constituting the world as a single, global 
place, or a global field.</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>Misina's distinction parallels the dichotomy between ideal and real 
types: both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, ideal types can 
be clear and logical, easy to understand and pleasant to work with. On the 
negative side, however, they often ignore what seems illogical and are therefore 
often misleading when applied to real world situations. By contrast, the 
complexities of empirical data often defy simple explanations and confront us 
with paradoxes that are hard to explain and render real world images 
inconsistent and contradictfory. This, of course, seriously hampers efforts to 
construct understandable images based on empirical observations. Apparent 
inconsistencies lead our pictures of the real world to look like a collage of 
incongruously assembled pictures and objects. Because it is hard to generalize 
about such productions and we cannot easily determine what logic governs the 
relationships among its elements, we tend to dismiss them as irrational and 
inconclusive. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Ideal types fit well into nomothetic reasoning, supporting rational 
syllogisms and theory development. By contrast, descriptive pictures of the real 
world can more easily be understood as idiographic productions, interesting by 
themselves but not readily utilized in theory development, testing, and 
prediction. Both the nomothethic perspectives associated with deductive 
reasoning and ideal types and the idiographic viewpoints linked with inductive 
observations are needed, I think, to help us understand the phenomena of 
globalization. However, we need to be clear about these differences, how they 
can actually reinforce and test each other, and for that reason we also need 
terms that clearly distinguish between them. Such considerations lead me to 
suggest a further addition to our vocabulary as follows: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[4A.1 A nomothetic (deductive) construction of the realities and 
problems of globalization:&nbsp;<A name=protoglo></A>protoglo, globalization as 
an ideal type </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[4A.2 An idiographic (inductive) construction of the realities and 
problems of globalization:&nbsp;<A name=factoglo></A>factoglo, globalization as 
a picture of reality </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The two neologisms suggested here are equivalents for cumbersome 
phrases. <EM>Protoglo</EM> uses <EM>proto</EM>-, a prefix that means "first" or 
"minimal" item in a series; and <EM>factoglobal </EM>rather arbitrarily uses 
<EM>facto</EM>- although it is not an established combining form. However, it 
does suggest both "fact" and "factor", each of which is relevant: facts because 
they provide the basis for inductive constructions, and factors as elements or 
building blocks in such a construction. Anyone unhappy with these forms can, of 
course, use the phrases mentioned here instead. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The proposed dichotomy should not, of course, be exaggerated. We may 
view these two concepts as contraries that can be combined to form mixed 
conceptually mixed notions. Perhaps, in fact, we are more likely to mix the two 
ways of perceiving globalization, yet it helps us to understand what we are 
doing if we keep these contrasted perspectives in mind. </STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>#4B<A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/power/sld011.htm">*</A>. The 
Normative Dimension. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The utility of these contrasting orientations becomes more evident 
when we think about their links with the normative dimensions of our thoughts 
about globalization. Complex empirical (inductive, idiographic) notions are 
typically ambivalent in the sense that they always suggest both good and bad 
aspects. By contrast, hypothetical (deductive, nomothetic) ideal types are 
especially vulnerable to wishful thinking. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Traditionally, we view "heaven" as an ideal type reflecting 
stereotypes about what we think of as desirable, whereas our ideas about "hell" 
depict images of everything that is abominable. Both perspectives apply to our 
understandings about globalization. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Both of these perspectives are implicit in the final sentence of <A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#TEHRANIAN">Tehranian's </A>text 
which tells us that we can think of globalization as both a positive and 
negative process -- it has good and bad consequences.&nbsp;<A 
name=T3></A></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>He writes: <EM>From a humanist perspective, globalization entails 
both positive and negative consequences: it is both narrowing and widening the 
income gaps among and within nations, intensifying and diminishing political 
domination, and homogenizing and pluralizing cultural identities.</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>When we think of globalization as a real world phenomenon, we see 
that it has many consequences, some that we like and others that we dislike. 
However, whenever we have the ideal types in mind, we are more likely to view 
the whole process of globalization as a good or a bad thing. The following text 
points to this distinction.&nbsp;<A name=KOC></A> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A 
href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#KOC">Koc</A>:<EM>[As a ] 
"process" of expansion of commodity relations on a global scale, globalization 
is not new but only intensified in recent decades. What is new about 
globalization is its entry into our daily language as an expression of 
"reality." In this sense, I argue that globalization is not only a process but 
also a discourse, defining, describing, and analyzing that process. I point out 
the neo-conservative ideology as the most prevalent influence in this discursive 
debate.</EM> </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>This brings us to the role of ideologies in our thinking. Ideologies 
may be viewed as a body of doctrines, beliefs and myths which inform our 
attitudes and actions. This concept enables us to understand why those who view 
globalization ideologically tend to see it as, inherently, either a good or a 
bad thing. They will, therefore, have contradictory notions about what the word 
represents -- while some will welcome it as a desirable outcome, others will 
condemn it as a disaster. By contrast, those who contemplate globalization as an 
empirical matter are more likely to understand that the phenomenon has both 
positive and negative consequences. Our texts provide examples of all these 
orientations but, without a vocabulary for distinguishing between them, we can 
easily understand these contradictories as incompatible with each other whereas, 
I believe, they simply reflect the contrasting views of people who are talking 
about different things -- some define <EM>globalization </EM>as an inherently 
desirable pattern, others think of it as an undesirable pattern, and some also 
speak of globalization as an historical process that has many consequences, some 
good and others bad. </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Most<EM> </EM>of the authors in our collection, I think, are inclined 
to view globalization empirically as a complex process with ambivalent 
consequences, and for them the following notions should make sense: </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>[4B.1] the effects of globalization:&nbsp;<A

<P><STRONG>[4B.10] the positive effects of globalization:&nbsp;<A

<P><STRONG>[4B.19] the negative effects of globalization:&nbsp;<A 
name=paraglo></A>negaglobalation </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>The term, <EM>globalation</EM>, was introduced above as a neologism 
that could be used to represent all the consequences, both good and bad, of 
globalization. Here I am suggesting that since such effects may be seen as 
positive or negative, it would be useful to have terms for these contraries -- 
in their adjectival forms, we might represent them as <EM>orthoglobal </EM>and 
<EM>negaglobal</EM>. We use <EM>ortho</EM>- as a combining form to represent 
right or correct, as in orthodox and orthodontics. By contrast, <EM>para</EM>- 
is used for the negative side-effects of something, as in paramour, paranoia, 
paraphilia, parapraxis, parasite, and parataxis. Some or our texts illustrate 
the uses of this concept.&nbsp;<A name=JUSSAUME></A> </STRONG>

<P><STRONG>&nbsp; In this table, "4A" represents the notion of an ideal type of 
globalation, by contrast with "4B" standing for empirical realities. Ideal type 
contrasts involve contradictories -- we tend to conceptualize a phenomenon as 
inherently good or bad as visualized in the table by positioning "4A.1" and 
"4A.2" in the middle of their boxes. By contrast, normative distinctions 
involving real world situations typically involve contraries, not 
contradictories: that is to say, the empirical consequences of globalation 
normally range between opposites and most actual situations fall between these 
extremes as measured by any normal distribution curve -- this is represented 
here by the scale from 4B.0 to 4B.9, and visually by the placement of these 
extremes at opposite ends of a continuum linked by various intermediate 
positions. Thus, when we think off globalization as an ideal type, it is easy to 
visualize it and to imagine that all its consequences are either good or bad. 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>When we think in terms of real world situations, by contrast, our 
vocabulary is often inadequate. It offers convenient terms for opposites without 
counterparts for modal or median concepts. For example, although we can speak of 
a glass of water as half full or half empty, we have no specific term for the 
intermediate and most common situation of being normal. If we referred to a 
"normal glass of water," we would be misunderstood as talking about the glass 
rather than what is in it. Were we to quantify the contents of a glass of water 
on a 0...9 scale, however, we would understand that the normal situation falls 
between these extremes, but quantification imposes false precision -- can we 
speak of a glass of water that's "83%" -- percent of what? Full? Empty? 
</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Similarly, to characterize the results of globalization [globalation] 
as a real world phenomenon, we need to talk about them by reference to the best 
and worst conditions, not the average, intermediate consequences. Actually, even 
terms for such middle-range consequences would be misleading because, normally, 
we have mixtures of good and bad consequences. I have used the term prismatic to 
characterize cross-pressured or hybrid situations in which the positive and 
negative dimensions of something are linked. Actually, I think many of the 
consequences of globalization are deeply prismatic, but I'll not discuss that 
here -- however, I have recently written about our global system as <A

<P><STRONG>A text that seems to link an ideal type with strongly negatory 
evaluations is offered by </STRONG>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/glotexts.htm#BOYD">Gary 
Boyd:</A><EM>Globalization is a newspeak word which implies that the dominative

But how to educate the public about the wiles of crimepetitive crapitalism when 
the corpocracy dominates all the media, is problematic indeed.!</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>One way to avoid taking such positions on the consequences of 
globalation is to raise questions and ask for evaluations -- at least this keeps 
our options open and may lead respondents to try to think through complex 
interdependencies. Consider this text by Wendell Bell as an example:&nbsp;<A

<P><STRONG>Perhaps this is a good place to stop -- as noted bove, the goal of 
this document is to raise, not answer, questions. It is not even a text, but
