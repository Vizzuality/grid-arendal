<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name="Problem Statement"></A><B>Problem Statement</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The most recent 
science assessment document for ground-level ozone (O3) was released in February 
of 1999 <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#1">[1]</A>, 
and for particulate matter (PM) in 1998 <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#2">[2]</A> 
. Over forty studies have concluded similar results: there is no threshold under 
which human and environmental effects (arguably intricately interwoven) do not 
occur, and the health and environment damage relationship to these pollutants is 
linear.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>PM refers to tiny 
airborne particles which range from approximately 0.005 µm to 100 µm in 
diameter, in solid or liquid forms, including both primary (emitted directly 
into the atmosphere) and secondary (formed in the atmosphere) particulates. 
Particles less that 0.005 µm in diameter are considered negligible. As size is 
the most appropriate indicator of the behaviour of particulate matter, it is 
generally divided into two fractions: coarse mode, with particles between 2.5 µm 
and 10 µm in size (PM10); and fine mode, with particles of 2.5 µm or less 
(PM2.5).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Natural emissions of 
both fine and coarse PM include wildfires, windblown dust, sea salt spray, some 
mineral particles, and natural nitrogen oxide (NOX) and volatile organic 
compound (VOC) emissions. Anthropogenic emissions, which constitute a 
substantial influx into the atmosphere, include road and construction dust, 
mineral dust due to mining and extraction, windblown agricultural soil, VOCs 
from vehicles, industrial processes and solvents, and sulphates and nitrates 
from power plants and transportation sources.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>PM is directly 
related to broad issues of environmental concern, such as smog, acid deposition, 
decreased visibility (up to 70% in some urban areas <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#3">[3]</A>), 
and climate change. It penetrates deeply and quickly into the lungs where there 
are no cilia to act as filters3. In humans, it has been linked to 
cardiorespiratory diseases, decreased lung function, increased respiratory 
stress, an increase in chronic bronchitis and asthma, and decreased visibility. 
PM refracts, reflects or absorbs light, creating a regional haze, reducing 
visability <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#4">[4]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Ground-level ozone is 
a secondary pollutant, a highly reactive and unstable form of oxygen, and the 
most detrimental of "photochemical" pollutants (photochemical reactions are 
those that require light). It is being continually created and destroyed in the 
troposphere by reactions involving oxygen molecules and ultraviolet light. The 
rate of synthesis of ozone is greatly increased by the presence of high 
concentrations of NOx and VOCs that react, with oxygen, in sunlight. NOx is 
primarily emitted by anthropogenic sources, most notably fossil fuel combustion, 
while natural sources are considered negligible. The transportation sector alone 
is responsible for 60% of NOx emissions in Canada.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Though VOCs are 
emitted primarily from natural sources such as forest fires and vegetation, the 
anthropogenic emissions (from combustion, incineration, industrial processes, 
evaporation of liquid fuels, paints, solvents, and organic chemicals) are those 
that dominate during episodes of oxidizing smogs in most affected regions of 
Canada <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#5">[5]</A>. 
As a result of the photochemical reactions required of these pollutants, the 
synthesis of ground-level ozone is more prolific on hot, sunny days, and is 
primarily a summer phenomenon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Ground-level ozone 
has a variety of adverse effects on humans. There is an 8.5% increase in 
hospital emergency department visits per 10 ppb increase of ambient ozone levels 
[<A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#6">6]</A>, 
and a high correlation between high tropospheric ozone levels and worker 
absenteeism <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#7">[7]</A>. 
In the respiratory system, ozone is linked to decreased lung function, chronic 
and acute bronchitis, asthma and pulmonary emphysema. It also causes headaches, 
burning eyes and irritated sinuses, while possibly interfering with the immune 
system. It is the chemical measured for use in smog indexes in urban 
areas.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name="Health and Environment Link"></A><B>Health and Environment 
Link</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>In a peer-reviewed 
document that is the result of twenty-three separate studies, a recent 
federal-provincial working group under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
(CEPA) identified reference levels to be those above which an effect on a 
receptor (humans or the environment) has been demonstrated. The reference level 
for ground-level ozone is considered 15 ppb (as a 1-hour daily maximum), and 
25/15 µg/m3 for PM10/2.5 (24-hour average). Numerous studies have shown, 
however, that there are no levels at which these pollutants do not affect some 
portion of the population16. Children, the elderly, and those already suffering 
from cardiorespiratory diseases are especially susceptible. Children breathe in 
50% more air per pound of body weight than do adults, making them particularly 
vulnerable to airborne pollutants <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#8">[8]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Ozone causes injury 
to foliage, increases susceptibility to diseases and other stresses in plants 
and tree species, reduces yields in sensitive crops at levels of 60 ppb <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#9">[9]</A>, 
and increases mortality rates of individual trees, eventually leading to a 
decline of species. According to the most recent Science Assessment Document, 
ozone is also linked to detrimental effects in the respiratory systems of 
animals, such as lung haemorrhages in birds <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#10">[10]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>PM causes unnatural 
biochemical interactions, soil effects, increased susceptibility of disease in 
vegetation, the smothering of leaves by blocking stomata, and reduction of 
visibility in wilderness as well as urban environments. It is associated with 
animal toxification (demonstrated by a reduction in lung clearance), changes in 
immunological responses, and possible onset of chronic alveolitis, fibrosis and 
lung cancer. PM can also cause degradation of inorganic materials (buildings, 
playground equipment, etc.), resulting corrosion, erosion, soiling and 
discoloration.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There are two primary 
difficulties in clearly establishing the environmental links to PM and 
ground-level ozone. These are the debates regarding natural background levels 
and transboundary air pollutants, and how they interact with and relate to 
regional anthropogenic emissions. Background levels are said to be the "natural" 
levels at which the pollutants occur in the atmosphere. Recorded background 
levels range from 25-40 ppb over a 1-hour averaging period for ground-level 
ozone, and from 4-11 µg/m3 for PM10 and 1-5 µg/m3 for PM2.5 over a 24-hour 
averaging period.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The debate revolves 
around the accuracy of studies that indicate that there are no lower thresholds 
at which adverse effects to do occur, while there are measured "natural" levels 
well in exceedence of zero. In other words, why should a fuss be made over the 
amount of pollutants we emit when nature is substantially emitting her own? It 
is established that there are natural sources for both PM and ground-level 
ozone, yet as previously mentioned, the anthropogenic emissions are found to be 
those most conducive to smog conditions because of their location and abundance. 
(Location and abundance operate as both individual and cooperative factors.) 
Further explanation of this is intricately related to the following area of 
debate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Transboundary air 
pollutants include air pollutants that are located in a region, but were 
produced elsewhere and travelled through the atmosphere without regard for 
political borders. NOx, VOCs and ozone can travel substantial distances in the 
atmosphere, causing problems through their introduction to regions that may not 
have marked emissions, or by further aggravating areas that are already 
suffering from excess emissions (such as in the Windsor-Quebec Corridor) <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#11">[11]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Travelling PM results 
in a reduction of visibility in wilderness areas that hold no local sources of 
emissions. There is also interaction and cooperation between the two types of 
pollutants. For instance, VOCs can be absorbed in particles and transported to 
rural areas where they can act as part of a "haze," then be released in response 
to temperature rise during the day and further facilitate the formation of 
ozone. The concept of Long-Range Transport of Atmospheric Pollutants (LRTAP) has 
been well established through case studies <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#12">[12]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The background levels 
for PM were taken relatively recently from remote sites in North America <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#13">[13]</A>. 
In light of the well accepted notions of LRTAP, it is arguable that there is no 
site in North America that is not suffering to a significant degree from 
anthropogenic emissions of these pollutants. Five studies cited in a 
ground-level ozone SAD examined youth while at summer camp. The studies observed 
"exposure of normal non-asthmatic children and adolescents to ozone under 
ambient conditions," which demonstrated "measurable declines in lung function 
and increases in symptoms." <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#14">[14]</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>In fact, it is common 
knowledge among those familiar with the pollutant that ground-level ozone 
concentrations tend to be highest at rural sites. What is uncommon, 
unfortunately, is the explanation. LRTAP explains ozone's presence in rural 
areas, but not necessarily its particular abundance. Even without a clear 
explanation of ozone's abundance in rural areas, it should remain evident that 
North America, with our excessively high industrial and domestic emissions 
levels, is not the first place to look for samples of natural backround 
emissions. Considering LRTAP, there may in fact be difficulties finding a purely 
natural, uncontaminated site anywhere on this planet.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name=Analysis></A><B>Analysis</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>With such evidence, 
it is becoming increasingly obvious that if Earth's vegetation is damaged even 
as much as we can currently prove with hard science, the inevitable results will 
be not only increased difficulty with food-growing and food supply and a 
reduction of the ecological services provided by the planet (only one of which 
is the increasingly relied-upon use of forest and ocean vegetation as "carbon 
sinks"). We will suffer a dramatic and sustained attack on human lifestyle, 
health and well-being.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There is broad enough 
consensus in the scientific community regarding the seriously detrimental 
effects of ground-level ozone, especially as it relates to vegetation. There is 
enough research to make most scientists and policy makers comfortable in this 
assertion. More research, however, is widely believed to be required with regard 
to particulate matter (both PM10 and PM2.5). PM has long been associated with 
chronic bronchitis and asthma, but has never been established as a causal agent, 
only an aggravate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Anthony S. Wexler, 
Professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Delaware, states that 
there is "an apparent correlation between concentrations of particulate matter 
and data on people getting sick and dying. Butthe physiological connection 
between particulate matter and health has never been fully explained."3 He and 
partner Ramesh Sarangapani are currently conducting research which they claim is 
"a first step toward better understanding of how theseparticles affect us."3 
Their work hopes to describe two unresearched ways that the particles effect 
humans: dispersion and expansion of the particulates in the respiratory system, 
resulting from contact with moisture. Initiatives of this nature will hopefully 
lead to stronger links between exposure to PM and health and environmental 
effects.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>More research is also 
required with regard to the natural background levels of both PM and Ozone. 
Scientists have been able to collect data on the ambient concentrations of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through the study of ancient ice cores. The 
rise and fall of the concentration through many centuries has been traced - 
particularly the marked rise which has occurred since the Industrial Revolution 
in the mid-nineteenth century.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Evidence of this 
nature would surely be of more use than samples taken in our current, 
widely-polluted atmosphere. Perhaps such data collection is not possible for the 
constituents and precursors of PM and ozone respectively. In that case, there 
should be concerted effort to seek out more appropriate sample areas; areas that 
are outside of the industrial world, have lowest-possible regional 
anthropological emissions, are out of range of intense, misrepresentative 
natural emission sources such as volcanoes, and have lowest-possible evidence of 
LRTAP. That is, if we wish to compare ourselves with the natural, regular, 
biochemical activities of the planet.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name=Recommendations></A><B>Recommendations</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Continued research in 
all areas which pertain to PM, ozone and their effects on humans, animals, and 
their biotic and abiotic environments, with stronger emphasis on the gapped 
areas such as PM, are of particular importance. Epidemiological studies, despite 
their numerous difficulties, are especially useful for the assessment of human 
response to these pollutants, because they test the "real world" soup of 
pollutants that populations are exposed to in the ambient environment, and can 
also isolate the detrimental effects of particular pollutants, such as 
ozone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There are available 
scientific statistics and findings describing the detrimental effects of 
particulate matter and ground-level ozone on humans, the environment, and the 
other organisms within it. This information should be shared with the general 
public by publishing it in a manner that is accessible and that translates the 
effects as clearly as possible. Such sharing should communicate to the public 
the possibility (and the need) for action on the parts of individuals, industry 
and government, against further development of health and environmental 
complications that are the results of exposure to these pollutants. The 
scientific evidence alone, if shared and published adequately, is enough to 
incite devoted response from the majority of individuals in this country (and on 
this planet) who, one would assume, are at least concerned about the air that 
they and future generations will breathe. After all, it is still individuals, 
for the most part, who make up our industries and government and influence the 
decisions made therein.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>THE CANADA-WIDE 
STANDARDS REGULATORY PROCESS, AS RELATED TO PM AND OZONE</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name="Standards Problem Statement"></A><B>Problem Statemen</B>t</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The Canada-Wide 
Standards process, underway in cooperation with the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment (CCME), is a result of the Canada-Wide Accord on 
Environmental Harmonization. The Accord was designed to reduce overlap and 
duplication in environmental regulation (despite word that a government-hired 
consultant found little overlap and duplication on environmental matters.) The 
process includes multi-stakeholder consultations, conducted with the purpose of 
gathering the input of members of the public from a variety of sectors 
(industry, health, aboriginal, and environmental non-governmental organizations 
- ENGOs). The CWS development committee (DC) is established to propose targets, 
time frames, and reporting protocols that are "achievablebased on sound science 
and the evaluation of risk to human health and the environment, recognizing 
environmental and socio-economic considerations." <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#15">[15]</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The responsibility 
for environmental regulation is being delegated to the CCME rather than the 
federal government (which is of concern at least with regard to the protection 
of aboriginal lands, which come only under federal jurisdiction). The consensual 
decision making process, while an attractive alternative to top-down federalism, 
gives each province vetoing power. Any party may withdraw from the CWS agreement 
with three months notice. This results in a sort of dysfunctional federalism 
with lowest-common-denominator results, as the provinces enter a race to the 
bottom in the effort to come up with a Canada-Wide Standard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Two stakeholder 
consultations, in October of 1998 and May of 1999 were held for the development 
of CWS for PM and ozone. As a result, "in part," <A 
href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/climate/ground-level-ozone.html#16">[16]</A> 
of stakeholder input, the following standards were accepted by the CCME on 
November 29, 1999 for endorsement in May of 2000:<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>· PM2.5: 30 µg/m3, 
  24-hour averaging time, by 2010; achievement to be based on the 98th 
  percentile ambient measurement annually, averaged over 3 consecutive 
  years</FONT> </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>· Ozone: 65 ppb, 
  8-hour averaging time, by 2015; achievement to be based on the 4th highest 
  measurement annually, averaged over 3 consecutive years.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><BR>These standards 
can be compared to the published reference levels for both pollutants, keeping 
in mind the evidence, as ratified by the CCME in its CWS document, that there 
are in fact no lower thresholds at which adverse human and environmental effects 
do not occur. Also notable is the absence of a standard for PM10. The 
explanation given is that there is higher correlation for health effects with 
PM2.5, PM10 affects a smaller proportion of the general population, and 
reduction to ambient levels of PM2.5 will result in some reduction of PM10 
levels. Annexes to the Standards document describe "Keeping Clean Areas Clean" 
and "Continuous Improvement" clauses, as well as details for exemptions of 
communities unable to reach achievement due to transboundary pollutants and high 
"natural" background levels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The Keeping Clean 
Areas Clean clause discourages communities with achievement below CWS from 
"polluting to the limit." Continuous Improvement is related in that it calls to 
communities which have levels below CWS, but still well above those at which 
adverse human health effects occur (ie. zero), to encourage them to achieve 
continuously lower levels. Communities that after "best efforts" still cannot 
achieve CWS levels due to transboundary pollutants and notably higher "natural" 
levels, will be exempt from achievement. Action will be taken on the part of 
federal and provincial governments to reduce external and internal transboundary 
flow so that achievement of CWS can eventually be reached.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There are various 
other components to the CWS for PM and ozone. Included is that CWS achievement 
is only applicable to communities with populations larger than 100,000, 
excluding rural communities and non-urban industrial sites. Monitoring 
equipment, as well, will only be stationed where the people "live, work and 
play," not at "rural (or background) and source specific 
sites."<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name="Health and Environment"></A><B>Health and Environment Link</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>In perusing the CWS 
document pending endorsement by the CCME, the environmental link to human 
health, as well as to the pollutants in general, is significantly lacking. 
Despite the initial quote in the Problem Statement of this section that was 
issued in June of 1998, the most current document states that "since the current 
CWS are related primarily to protection of human health, their adequacy for the 
protection of vegetation, visibility impairment, material damage or other 
adverse effects may need to be assessed."16</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>As mentioned in the 
Science section of this paper, scientific links are established between PM and 
ozone and effects on vegetation, visibility impairment, material damage and 
animal health. That those generally-accepted links exist in the scientific 
community is not a controversial notion. The controversy exists over the details 
of particular links.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Within the regulatory 
process, as with the science, controversy remains over how to deal with 
transboundary pollutants and "natural" background levels of pollutants. This is 
because the CWS follow the science without a clearly established position. Many 
industries in the stakeholder process argued that background levels in some 
areas were higher than, or too close to, proposed targets (these were targets of 
20 µg/m3 and 25 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 40 ppb or 60 ppb for ozone proposed by the 
ENGO and Health sectors respectively). They argued that background levels made 
such targets fundamentally unachievable, and that such standards blew out of 
proportion the adverse effects of these pollutants at background levels (ie. if 
mother nature is doing it too, it can't be so bad for us.) As mentioned in the 
Science section, LRTAP is likely to significantly effect "natural" background 
levels, rendering the levels as they are recorded and established now 
misleading.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><A 
name="Standards Analysis"></A><B>Analysis</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The existence of the 
division between human health and environmental effects is arguable in itself, 
and is exemplified through the integral notion of primary importance that is 
given to human health above destruction of the environment. As mentioned, if 
vegetation and other wildlife are affected by these pollutants, is it not 
prudent to assume direct potential risk to humans, if not to assume that we will 
in fact be affected through the complicated interdependency of food chains and 
webs in the biosphere? The protection of the environment and all organisms it 
hosts for their intrinsic value, not only for their utilitarian and service 
values, is also arguable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The CWS approach, in 
terms of the calculations used to arrive at the standards, is ineffective in 
dealing with background levels of pollutants and LRTAP. Clauses exist for the 
exemption of communities unsuccessful of achievement due to high background 
levels, but exemption of accountability due to these and transboundary 
pollutants (that arguably affect background levels in the first place) is 
already worked in to the calculation for achievement. For PM2.5, achievement is 
based on the 98th percentile measurement annually, averaged over three 
consecutive years. This already allows for a so-called smoothing out of extreme 
data from "high days" due to background, transboundary, or internal 
levels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The makeup and thus 
the application of scientific health studies (whether epidemiological or lab 
oriented) is also of concern. Aside from the specified studies using children, 
most are conducted on healthy, younger-middle-aged men. As long as these tests 
are conducted and thus applied in this manner, they will not sufficiently 
represent the needs and concerns of women and the elderly, who outnumber the 
population represented by the data. This concerns the represented population 
directly as well, not only in regard to their friends and family. A woman's body 
is, after all, the first environment for all humans, past and 
present.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Most importantly, in 
direct relation to the regulatory process, there is more than enough research 
detailing the risks of exposure to PM and ozone to warrant the implementation of 
the Precautionary Principle. This is described in the Canada-Wide Environmental 
Standards Sub-Agreement as: "where there are threats of serious or irreversible 
environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a 
reason for postponing the development and implementation of standards." An 
unrecognized, uncertain or denied risk is still a risk. Despite attractive 
attributes such as the Keeping Clean Areas Clean and Continuous Improvement 
clauses, the standards as proposed to the CCME do not reflect implementation, 
serious or otherwise, of the precautionary principle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Instead of the 
Precautionary Principle, cost/benefit analyses such as the Air Quality Valuation 
Model (AQVM) are given increased weight in the determination of standards. This 
raises many questions regarding the efficacy of these analyses that address how 
they are conducted as well as how they are used in the standard-setting process: 
Can non-monetary costs and benefits be accurately given dollar values? Should 
they be given dollar values? Can and/or should we risk financial debt or 
economic shift in order to eliminate these pollutants? Should we let finances 
influence our decision at all?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There are a few 
examples that illustrate potential destinies for us, depending on the decisions 
all of us make today (and some of us make in May of 2000). The issues of banning 
Bovine Growth Hormone in Canada, and the labelling of cigarette packages by the 
attorney general of the US were both carried out in adherence to the 
precautionary principle, without infallible scientific proof. They avoided 
potential or continued risks to human health in varying degrees, all of which is 
proven to us as research continues. And as research continues, there is always 
possibility for ammendment - which may result in more stringent or less 
stringent standards, depending on the research. In either case, the possibility 
of further human and environmental health risks are avoided.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The question is 
whether we would rather risk futher debilitated human and environmental health, 
or risk moderate decreases of monetary profits. The issues of lead in gasoline 
and DDT are examples of the opposite. Both substances took many years to be 
banned, and waited for the infallible evidence that was eventually provided by 
not only the scientists, but the numerous living and dead subjects of what 
turned out to be a vast human experiment.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
