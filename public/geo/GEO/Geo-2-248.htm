<P>VANCOUVER</B> - Fisheries and Oceans Canada is releasing two million sockeye 
fry into the Upper Adams River watershed this spring in a continuing program to 
rebuild a stock driven to extinction in the early part of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
Century.</P>
<P>Last fall, the Upper Adams River, near Chase, saw a record 70,000 adult 
sockeye salmon return to its spawning grounds, a stunning recovery for a river 
that was devoid of salmon from 1913 to 1953. The Upper Adams early summer 
sockeye run was historically one of the largest in the Fraser River watershed 
before it was devastated in the early 1900s by the operation of a splash dam at 
the outlet of Adams Lake.</P>
<P>This spring, Fisheries and Oceans, in partnership with the Adams Lake Band, 
is releasing two million sockeye fry to continue rebuilding the stock. One 
million sockeye fry, raised at the Shuswap River Hatchery, have been released 
into the Upper Adams River. A further one million fry, which were transferred 
from the hatchery to net pens near the mouth of the Upper Adams River, also have 
been released.</P>
<P>The Upper Adams is a separate stock from the famed sockeye that spawn in the 
lower reaches of the Adams River, a run of millions in its dominant years. The 
sockeye's four-year spawning cycle typically has one peak spawning year, called 
the dominant run.</P>
<P>The return of sockeye to the Upper Adams will not only provide opportunities 
to those dependent on the fishery for economic benefit and cultural fulfillment, 
it will also boost the entire ecosystem by returning nutrients into the 
watershed and feeding a complex web of life. Everything from micro-organisms, to 
other fish species to birds of prey, bears and even the trees in the watershed 
are expected to benefit from the nutrients that the sockeye's life cycle 
contributes to the ecosystem.</P>
<P>The Department's Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has been striving to 
rebuild this stock since 1988, in partnership with local First Nations. These 
efforts have carried on work involving the transplant of hatchery-reared fry 
that began in 1949 by the former International Pacific Salmon Fisheries 
Commission.<BR><BR>By the 1980s, the spawning numbers, known as escapements, 
began to improve. In 1992, 2,990 sockeye returned and, in 1996, about 25,000 
sockeye returned. The recovery is a result of many decades of varied salmon 
enhancement activities, as well as management measures that have set harvest 
rates at levels that allow adult salmon to return to spawning grounds. In the 
summer of 1997, to help increase both the size and survival of young sockeye 
salmon rearing in Adams Lake, the Department added nutrients to the lake to 
stimulate the production of the sockeye's food (plankton). The nutrient program 
is planned again for the summer of 2001.</P>
<P align=justify>The Adams Lake Band, for whom the Upper Adams run has 
historical importance, works in partnership with the Department on this program, 
assisting in all field activities. Another key partner is Wolski Environmental 
Consulting, which operates the Shuswap River Hatchery on contract to the 
Department. Forest Renewal B.C. has provided funding to the Upper Adams 
program.<B><BR><BR></B></P>
