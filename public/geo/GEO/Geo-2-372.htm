<CENTER><STRONG>SEPTEMBER 30, 1997</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
<P>It is a privilege to appear before this Committee today to highlight the 
critical importance of linking silvicultural prescriptions with prescribed fire 
opportunities on a large enough scale to restore and sustain the health of 
fire-adapted ecosystems in the United States. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>DOUBLE STANDARD SLOWS PRESCRIBED FIRE 
PROGRESS</STRONG></CENTER><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>A recent survey conducted by Forest Service research indicated that over five 
million acres are treated annually by prescribed fire in the United States, 
mostly in the South and Southeast. Purposes for using prescribed fire included 
hazard reduction, vegetation management, range improvement, wildlife habitat 
improvement, and other reasons. 
<P>But a double standard dramatically hampers our ability to prescribe fire on 
the landscape on a large enough scale to truly make a difference. Even five 
million acres is quite inadequate, especially in the West, where insufficient 
prescribed fire projects are conducted on large Federal holdings on an annual 
basis. 
<P>The double standard is one where practically any strategy can be adopted in 
suppressing a wildfire and vast amounts of money can be spent in implementing 
that strategy. No matter how adverse the outcome, politicians and the public 
generally side with the fire suppression specialist. A prescribed fire, on the 
other hand, can be well-planned and well-executed, but if anything starts to go 
awry the support from politicians, the public, and even internal colleagues, is 
quickly lost. This double standard is part of our tradition and culture, because 
the wildfire suppression decision is generously funded and essentially risk-free 
in the public arena, whereas prescribed fire implementation is much more closely 
scrutinized and carries a large risk. A few examples exist today where the 
double standard is being challenged and more latitude is being provided for 
prescribed fire. 
<P>The following "lessons learned" can be applied in dealing with the declining 
forest health problem in the western U.S.: 
<UL>
  <P>1. Most forest ecosystems (plants and animals) are adapted to fire. 
  <P>2. It is not a question of if a fire will occur, but only when and where. 
  There will be fire and there will be smoke. 
  <P>3. Either pay now for a more balanced program of fire prevention, wildfire 
  suppression and prescribed fire, or pay a dear price later due to escalating 
  losses of people, property, and natural resources in uncontrollable wildfires. 

  <P>4. Silvicultural and fire prescriptions must be integrated on a much larger 
  scale to restore ecosystem health. This will require pre-commercial thinning 
  and carefully planned cutting to restore stand densities and species 
  composition that are sustainable into the future. Many stand conditions are so 
  flammable today as a result of fire exclusion that prescribed burning without 
  prior silvicultural treatment would be tantamount to igniting a conflagration. 

  <P>5. Fortunately silvicultural cutting treatments designed to maintain 
  healthy forests often will pay the way for follow-up hazard reduction burning. 

  <P>6. The "buck needs to stop here." Risk for expanded prescribed fire 
  projects must be shared among all stakeholders: agencies, politicians, and the 
  public.

<CENTER><STRONG>FIRE IN WILDLANDS</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Periodic forest, grassland, and tundra fires are part of the natural 
environment--as natural and vital as rain, snow, or wind (Heinselman 1978). 
Evidence of past fires and their periodicity is found in charcoal layers in 
lakes and bogs; and in the fire-scarred cross sections of trees. Fire-adapted 
ecosystems that are found throughout North America are termed fire-dependent, if 
recurring disturbances by fire are essential to the functioning of these systems 
(Heinselman 1978). Numerous examples have been documented on how fire affects 
the functioning of ecosystems: regulating plant succession; regulating fuel 
accumulations; controlling age, structure, and species composition of 
vegetation; affecting insect and disease populations; influencing nutrient 
cycles and energy flows; regulating biotic productivity, diversity, and 
stability; and determining habitats for wildlife. 
<P>Lightning, volcanoes, and people have been igniting fires in wildland 
ecosystems for millenia. The current emphasis on ecosystem management calls for 
the maintenance of interactions between such disturbance processes and ecosystem 
functions. It is incumbent, therefore, on resource managers and fire managers to 
understand the historic frequency, intensity, and areal extent of past fires. 
Such knowledge provides a frame of reference for prescribing appropriate 
management practices on a landscape scale. Many studies have described the 
historical occurrence of fires throughout the world. Swetnam (1993), for 
example, reported on 2000 years of fire history in giant sequoia groves in 
California. He found that frequent small fires occurred during a warm period 
from about A.D. 1000 to 1300, and less frequent but more widespread fires 
occurred during cooler periods from about A.D. 500-1000 and after 1300. However, 
throughout the 2000 years of record fires occurred at intervals of less than 25 
years, until the last century when agencies have been able to eliminate the 
pattern of frequent fires. Thus, several decades of attempted fire exclusion 
have threatened long-lived Giant Sequoia trees with fatal crown fires where the 
trees had co-existed previously for thousands of years with low intensity 
surface fires. 
<P>Swain (1973) determined from lake sediment analysis in the Boundary Waters 
Canoe Area in Minnesota that tree species and fire had interacted in complex 
ways over a 10,000 year period. There is an even larger body of science that 
details the numerous effects of wildland fires on ecosystems. It is this 
knowledge of fire history, fire regimes, and fire effects that allows managers 
to develop silvicultural prescriptions, fire prescriptions, and prescribed fire 
programs to achieve a variety of resource management objectives. 
<P>The role of fire as an important disturbance process has been highlighted in 
a classification of continental fire regimes (Kilgore and Heinselman 1990). They 
described a natural fire regime as the total pattern of fires over time that is 
characteristic of a region or ecosystem. Fire regimes are defined in terms of 
fire type and intensity, typical fire sizes and patterns, and fire frequency, or 
length of return intervals in years. Natural fire regimes of North America are 
placed into seven classes, ranging from Class 0 where fires are rare or absent 
to Class 6 where crown fires and severe surface fires occur at return intervals 
longer than 300 years. Intermediate fire regimes are characterized by increasing 
fire return intervals and increasing fire intensities. Class 2, for example, 
describes the situation for long-needled pines, like longleaf pine, ponderosa 
pine, and Jeffrey pine, where low intensity, surface fires occurred rather 
frequently (return intervals of less than 25 years). Lodgepole pine, jackpine, 
and the boreal forest of Canada and Alaska generally fall into Class 4, where 
high intensity crown fires occurred every 25 to 100 years; or into Class 5 where 
crown fires occurred every 100 to 300 years. 
<P>The noteworthy aspect of continental fire regimes for our consideration is 
that very few plant communities, or ecosystems, in North America fall into Class 
0 where fires are rare or absent. In other words, most ecosystems in the United 
States evolved in environments where wildland fires occurred in a consistent 
manner, establishing fire as a process that affects the numerous ecosystem 
functions described earlier. The application of prescribed fire for many 
different purposes has attempted to mimic the natural role of fire in producing 
fire-related ecosystem effects. Our problem, as we shall see later, is simply 
one where we have not used enough prescribed fire on a large scale to sustain 
the productivity of fire-adapted ecosystems. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>DECLINING FOREST HEALTH</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Numerous ecosystem indicators, however, from the Southeast to the West are 
presenting alarming examples of declining forest health. Attempted fire 
exclusion practices, prolonged drought, and epidemic levels of insects and 
diseases have coincided to produce extensive forest mortality, or major changes 
in forest density and species composition. Gray (1992) called attention to a 
forest health emergency in parts of the western United States where trees have 
been killed across millions of acres in eastern Oregon and Washington. He 
indicated that similar problems extend across a much larger area south into 
Utah, Nevada, and California, and east into Idaho. Denser stands and heavy fuel 
accumulations are also setting the stage for high intensity crown fires in 
Montana, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Nebraska, where the historical norm 
in long-needled pine forests was for more frequent low intensity surface fires 
(fire regime Class 2). 
<P>Since the 1980's, large wildfires in dead and dying western forests have 
accelerated the rate of forest mortality, threatening people, property, and 
natural resources (Mutch 1994). These wildfires also have emitted large amounts 
of particulate matter into the atmosphere. One study (Hardy and others 1992) 
estimated that more than 53 million pounds of respirable particulate matter were 
produced over a 58-day period by the 1987 Silver Fire in southwestern Oregon! 
Yet wildfires are generally looked upon as exceptional events by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and are outside their purview as they 
promulgate clean air strategies. These wildfires, however, can no longer be 
considered exceptional events. More than 50 years ago Weaver (1943) reported 
that the "complete prevention of forest fires in the ponderosa pine region of 
California, Oregon, Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana has certain 
undesirable ecological and silvicultural effects...conditions are already 
deplorable and are becoming increasingly serious over large areas." Also, Cooper 
(1961) stated that "fire has played a major role in shaping the world's 
grassland and forests. Attempts to eliminate it have introduced problems fully 
as serious as those created by accidental conflagrations." 
<P>Some have said that we have been engaged in a "grand ecological experiment" 
as we attempt to exclude fire from fire-adapted ecosystems. Even in the 
southeastern United States where the majority of prescribed burning is 
conducted, a recent report indicated that there were 90 million acres of 
longleaf pine during the late nineteenth century. Current inventories accounted 
for 2.9 million acres of longleaf pine today; and projected that longleaf pine 
was being lost at the rate of 100,000 acres a year. One reason attributed to 
this decline was the absence of fire, contributing to a type conversion to 
hardwoods. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>The clarity of hindsight might move some to question resource management 
agencies for their slowness in responding to clear warnings that were sounded in 
the 1940's and 1960's by people like Weaver and Cooper. But that would be a 
simplistic assessment for a complex situation. Resource management and fire 
management policies, regulations, and practices evolve gradually over time and 
are affected by many internal and external expectations. The external 
expectations may come from society at large, politicians, and regulatory 
agencies. Many of the early internal and external expectations were founded on 
the calamities brought about by catastrophic fires in the late 1800's and early 
1900's. Wildland fires were viewed as the enemy to be eradicated from the 
forests, not as a natural disturbance process with many benefits. The several 
era's of fire control and fire management from then to now have been carefully 
traced by Pyne (1982). So it is not really surprising in the aftermath of the 
extensive 1910 wildfires that an organizational culture developed that 
emphasized fire suppression programs over prescribed fire programs; program 
emphasis that was universally accepted by society and politicians. But in the 
intervening decades since 1910, a large body of scientific knowledge has 
developed regarding fire history, fire regimes, and fire effects; the decline in 
the health of ecosystems has reached alarming proportions; and large, high 
intensity wildfires are increasing in numbers since the mid-1980's. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>PRESCRIBED FIRE</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>How widespread is the use of prescribed fire, fires designed to produce 
beneficial results, in the United States today? A recent survey (Ward and others 
1993) indicated that over five million acres are treated annually by prescribed 
fire in the United States. Over 70 percent of all prescribed burning, or about 
3.5 million acres, was in the Southeast. Purposes for using prescribed fire 
included hazard reduction, silviculture, wildlife habitat improvement, range 
improvement, vegetation management, and other reasons. The survey lumped such 
prescribed burning reasons as watershed management, pest control, disease 
control, and research in the category called "other". A category apparently not 
covered in the survey was the use of prescribed natural fire in national parks 
and wildernesses to perpetuate fire-dependent ecosystems. Many national parks 
and wildernesses across the United States have approved plans that allow 
lightning fires to burn when all prescription criteria have been met. Some of 
these individual prescribed natural fires have been 10-15 thousand acres or 
larger in size in the Rocky Mountains. Whether prescribed fires are ignited by 
managers or by natural causes, all prescribed fire plans include criteria for 
burning in such a manner to minimize impacts on air quality. Resource management 
agencies and private timber companies cooperate with State Air Quality Bureaus 
to prescribe burn in a way that reduces adverse effects on human health and 
visibility. 
<P>We can see from this survey that prescribed burning practices are 
concentrated in the southeastern states. Also, although 5 million acres burned 
annually appears to be a large number, foresters and ecologists are projecting a 
much greater need for prescribed fire in the future to maintain, or restore, the 
health of fire-adapted ecosystems. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>A DOUBLE STANDARD</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>A change in direction is clearly indicated--and that change has been embodied 
in the concept of ecosystem management where we attempt to sustain the 
productivity of all components of ecosystems, allowing society to enjoy the 
by-products of healthy systems. As we already have noted, recurring fire is an 
integral disturbance process to the functioning of fire-adapted ecosystems. But 
a double standard is impairing our ability to prescribe fire on the landscape on 
a large enough scale to truly sustain healthy systems. The double standard is 
simply one where practically any strategy can be adopted in suppressing a 
wildfire, any amount of money can be spent in implementing that strategy, and 
any outcome can be realized from good to bad. No matter how adverse the outcome 
(including the burning of 200,000 acres and the destruction of over 1000 homes 
in southern California in 1993), politicians and the general public will support 
the fire suppression specialist. A prescribed fire, on the other hand, can be 
well-planned and well-executed by qualified people, but the moment something 
goes awry the support from politicians and the public, and even internally, is 
quickly lost. The reprisal is generally immediate because the agency started the 
fire and it is their fault if something goes wrong. This double standard is part 
of the tradition and culture of many wildland fire management agencies, since 
the wildfire suppression decision is generously funded and essentially risk-free 
in the public arena. 
<P>The double standard even carries over into the way that regulatory agencies 
address wildland fire programs. Thus, the wildfire and its smoke are considered 
"natural events" by the Environmental Protection Agency, and are not as 
stringently regulated as prescribed fires to achieve clean air standards. We 
have learned by now that it is not a question of if we are going to have 
wildland fires, but simply a matter of when and where. And the wildfires are 
occurring at increasing frequencies and intensities, producing large volumes of 
smoke over extensive areas. Wildfire smoke is the bad smoke. This doesn't mean 
that prescribed fire smoke is good smoke, but it may be better smoke if 
emissions can be timed to mitigate the future production of unregulated wildfire 
smoke. Residents of the wildland/urban interface, air and water quality 
regulators, endangered species specialists, and resource managers need to plan 
for the "when" of fire occurrence. 
<P>An enlightened tolerance on the part of all sectors of society needs to 
accommodate prescribed fire on a landscape scale, coupled with other management 
practices, as part of the solution in sustaining healthy ecosystems to benefit 
people. This will require confronting the numerous barriers imposed either 
directly or indirectly by the double standard, and seeking appropriate solutions 
that better balance essential and strong fire suppression programs with equally 
well-supported prescribed fire programs. The list of elements receiving 
preferential treatment under the double standard is a varied one: liability, air 
quality, water quality, threatened and endangered species, risks, and funding. 
In most cases these considerations due not hamper operational practices in 
suppressing a wildfire. But this very same list can pose distinct barriers to 
prescribed fire practices. 
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>NEW INITIATIVES</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>There are some breakthroughs today, however, in providing more latitude for 
expansive prescribed fire programs. The state of Florida, for example, has 
enacted innovative legislation that provides more protection for the prescribed 
burner in terms of liability. A cooperative program in Oregon among federal and 
state agencies is developing a fire emissions tradeoff model to predict the 
smoke emissions produced from prescribed fires and wildfires in the Blue 
Mountains of northeastern Oregon (USDA Forest Service 1993). The ultimate goal 
of this effort is to implement a level of prescribed burning that minimizes 
total smoke emissions. The Western States Air Resources Council (WESTAR), a 
non-profit association of air quality agencies in the fourteen western states, 
has drafted an initiative called "Forest Health Initiative to Restore 
Ecosystems" (FIRES). WESTAR's intent of FIRES is to "address forest health-air 
quality technical and policy issues of concern to Congress, the western state 
air regulators, federal land management agencies, and the public" (WESTAR 1994). 
The goal of the three year project is to bring together a broad-based consortium 
to develop regional solutions based on strong science to balance the needs of 
forest health while protecting air quality. All of these initiatives and others 
are providing more latitude for prescribed fire programs to evolve in a more 
supportive environment. Obviously two additional elements that need to be better 
resolved are the important issues of sufficient funding and the better sharing 
of risk by all stakeholders. Some progress is being achieved here as well. 
<P>Because many stands are now excessively dense and contain many dead and dying 
trees (Mutch and others 1993), sanitation and salvage, thinning, and partial 
cutting may be necessary before initiating extensive prescribed burning 
programs. In other situations resource managers and fire managers have been able 
to proceed with landscape scale prescribed burns: a 16,000 acre prescribed fire 
on the Santa Fe National Forest in April 1993, a 1,000 prescribed fire on the 
Boise National Forest, a 700 acre prescribed fire for wildlife winter range and 
forest health on the Lolo National Forest in April 1994, a 6000 acre prescribed 
fire on the Umatilla National Forest in 1994, and a 5000 acre aerially ignited 
crown fire on the Tetlin Wildlife Refuge in Alaska in 1993. Managers are clearly 
beginning to apply prescribed fire on scales large enough to produce some 
meaningful ecosystem effects. 
<P>Concern over another severe fire season in California in 1993 led to the 
establishment of a special interagency Fire Strategies Team in June 1994. The 
Team was composed of 13 different state, federal, and local fire and resource 
agencies, as well as 11 other private and local participants with diverse 
interests in watershed, fire, and environmental issues. The vision of the Team 
is to develop strategies to change the historical pattern of spending millions 
of dollars extinguishing large, damaging fires to a more balanced fuels and 
pre-fire management program (Board of Forestry 1995). Key goals of the Team are 
to achieve a sustainable ecosystem and the maintenance of healthy forests while 
providing defensible space for the protection of life and property. 
<P>Resource management agencies, regulatory agencies, politicians, and society 
have a challenging opportunity to implement meaningful resource management and 
fire management programs at a scale large enough to truly sustain the health of 
fire-adapted ecosystems to benefit people, property, and natural resources. This 
will require cooperation and consensus-building at a level never before 
experienced in resource management. People need to move away from litigation and 
the courtroom as strategies for managing natural resources. The emphasis now 
should be devoted towards the decades of research results that provide the basis 
for managing ecosystems more in harmony with disturbance factors to foster the 
health, resilience, and productivity of wildland ecosystems. Examples already 
exist where the double standard is being confronted and prior obstacles are 
being converted into opportunities for success. We simply need to build on those 
successes. 
<P>Mr. Chairman, this concludes my written statement; and I thank you again for 
the opportunity to participate in this important hearing.
