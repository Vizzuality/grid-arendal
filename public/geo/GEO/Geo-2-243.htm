<P></P>
<P><BR>On March 16 1999, the U.S. Commerce Department's National Marine and 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) added nine populations of West Coast salmon to the 
endangered species list, bringing the total number of federally-protected salmon 
subspecies to 24. The recent designations are especially significant because for 
the first time federal protection has been extended to salmon inhabiting streams 
located in a heavily-populated area of the Pacific Northwest, namely Seattle. 
Seattle now has the dubious distinction of being the first large city to come 
under the strict regulatory scrutiny of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</P>
<P>Listing these salmon as endangered is certain to inflict significant harm on 
the region's economy, causing billions of dollars in losses for a broad range of 
industries including those involved with timber, housing, recreation and 
agriculture, among others. Additionally, the listings will force federal, state 
and local governments to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a multitude of 
salmon-restoration programs that will require increases in taxes for such basic 
services as water and sewer. Individuals will also feel the pinch in the form of 
intrusive regulations governing routine water use, lawn care, car washing and 
any other activity that can conceivably create water runoff problems for 
fish.</P>
<P>The NMFS insists that these huge regulatory burdens are necessary. Federal 
officials and environmentalists claim that a precipitous decline in the 
population of West Coast salmon that has been occurring since the mid-1970s is 
attributable to human activities such as over-harvesting, habitat destruction 
for development projects, hatchery and dam operations, and land-use and water 
project development that degrade stream conditions vital to salmon survival.</P>
<P>But the premise that human actions are responsible for the decline of salmon, 
thus justifying sweeping regulations against development, is erroneous. The 
NMFS's ESA listing ignores a rapidly accumulating body of scientific evidence 
showing that changes in the natural climatic conditions of the Pacific Northwest 
are largely responsible for the low numbers of salmon. Specifically, a 
naturally-occurring increase in the temperature of the Pacific Ocean off the 
coast has caused a sharp decline in salmon by destroying most of the salmon's 
food supply and increasing the number of fish that prey on salmon.</P>
<P>It is these ocean conditions, not man, that play the preeminent role in 
causing fluctuations in salmon population levels. The federal response of 
placing more salmon under ESA protection and imposing additional regulatory 
burdens on businesses and property owners in the region will do nothing to 
counter the adverse natural forces that harm salmon but will needlessly hurt the 
economy. Most importantly, the oceanic phenomenon that has been so detrimental 
to salmon survival operates on a 20-to-30 year cycle, and there is evidence that 
the ocean cycle is entering a phase that will stimulate a major rebound in the 
salmon population, making cumbersome government mandates unnecessary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Salmon Have Declined Despite Conservation Efforts and a Better 
Environment</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>The number of salmon entering the Columbia River has fallen dramatically from 
a high of 2.03 million in 1970 to a low of 673,000 in 1995.1 By the mid-1990s, 
the salmon population had dropped by at least 70%. Naturally, this decline is an 
issue of grave concern to fishermen and government leaders given the great 
importance of salmon to the Pacific Northwest economy. Because the salmon catch 
had been at record high levels prior to the sudden decline, it was assumed that 
the only explanation for this sudden precipitous decline in the salmon 
population had to be due to human activities. Fish biologists and environmental 
activists argued that a combination of overfishing, land development near 
streams and rivers, dam operations and other human factors combined to deprive 
salmon of the natural habitat necessary for them to swim and procreate without 
hindrance.</P>
<P>The Pacific Northwest's rivers and streams are important to the ecological 
cycle of the salmon because it is where adult salmon migrate to lay their eggs. 
After hatching, the young salmon make their way to the ocean where they spend 
one to three years before returning to the rivers to procreate, or spawn, thus 
beginning the cycle again.</P>
<P>Since 1978, at least $3 billion has been spent to increase, or at least 
maintain, the West Coast salmon population.2 Fishery managers have mainly used 
this money to operate hatcheries that breed salmon, monitor harvest levels and 
restore salmon habitat. A broad range of other policies has been implemented to 
enhance salmon survivability rates.</P>
<P>Because salmon lay their eggs in shallow, cool pools that are often found 
along the banks of streams, forestry practices have changed in recent years to 
protect salmon from harm. For example, buffer zones - areas directly adjacent to 
stream banks where activities that might disturb breeding pools or other vital 
habitat are prohibited - are now required. Buffers mandate that no construction 
or other development take place within a specified distance from a stream bank 
to prevent harm to breeding pools or other vital habitat.</P>
<P>Other land-use laws have also been implemented to severely restrict 
development near rivers and wetlands. This is the reason why there have been no 
new dams built in Washington in the past 35 years. Dams can block the migration 
routes of salmon and dam turbines can pose serious hazards to salmon 
survivability. As a result, existing dams now have fish ladders that allow 
salmon to swim past the dam as well as fish-friendly turbines that prevent 
salmon from being harmed.</P>
<P>Citizen groups have also organized to clean many streams while agricultural 
land-use practices and wastewater treatment have steadily improved over the last 
25 years.3 Together these efforts have helped Pacific Northwest streams become 
significantly cleaner than they were in the 1970s and thus more ecologically 
amenable to salmon. A federally-funded 1991 study by the Battelle Marine 
Science's Laboratory, for example, concluded that Puget Sound - home of the 
Puget Sound chinook salmon that was recently listed by the NMFS - is the 
cleanest it has been since before World War II.4 Nevertheless, the salmon has 
not rebounded.</P>
<P>Despite billions of dollars in expenditures, widespread implementation of 
policies to aid the salmon and a cleaner environment, the salmon population 
continues to decline. The NMFS and environmental activists insist that more 
stringent regulation, more restrictions on development and additional spending 
is needed. But if the previous efforts could not halt the salmon decline, it is 
doubtful that doing more of the same will yield better results.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Warmer Ocean Temperatures Have Been Killing the Salmon</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Until recently, fish biologists assumed that only changes in the freshwater 
habitat of salmon could explain the variability in the salmon population. 
Scientists were thus quick to conclude that human modification of this habitat 
was the reason for the salmon population decline. Implicit in this assumption 
was the rejection of the possibility that other factors - such as natural 
oceanic cycles - played a significant role in salmon survivability. It was 
assumed that the ocean was simply a stable, benign force that could be 
discounted in assessing the fortunes of salmon populations.</P>
<P>This turned out to be incorrect.</P>
<P>The marked decline in the salmon catch beginning in the mid-1970s 
corresponded to an increase in the temperature of the Pacific Ocean off the 
coasts of Washington, Oregon and California. This warming has had a most 
detrimental impact on salmon survival rates.</P>
<P>When the water warms, nutrients needed for the production of phytoplankton 
(algae) - including phosphorous, nitrogen and silicon - drop. When phytoplankton 
production decreases, tiny invertebrate organisms called zooplankton which feed 
on the phytoplankton also decreases. Since 1976, zooplankton levels have 
declined by an estimated 70% due to ocean warming. Because salmon feed on 
zooplankton, they have suffered accordingly.5</P>
<P>Dr. Victor Kaczynski, a fish biologist and consultant on fishing issues in 
the Pacific Northwest, says that "per classical ecological theory, a 70% decline 
in zooplankton biomass results in a 70% reduction in predators dependent on 
zooplankton directly and in their food chain (such as coho salmon) while an 80% 
reduction would result in a food supply that could only support 20% of the prior 
predator biomass (such as coho salmon)." With a reduction in zooplankton levels 
by more than 70% in the past two decades, West Coast salmon have declined by at 
least 70% as well.6</P>
<P>In addition, the salmon numbers are further reduced because the warmer water 
attracts predators such as mackerel and Pacific hake. These fish doubly threaten 
the salmon by consuming the reduced zooplankton food supply and by eating the 
salmon themselves.</P>
<P>Salmon are not the only marine animals affected by warm water conditions, 
however. The populations of the California Murre seabird and the Washington 
Murre have fallen by 50% and 80%, respectively, since the 1970s. Oysters, Oregon 
pink shrimp, sole and other fish have experienced dramatic declines similar to 
the salmon.7</P>
<P>An examination of the survival rates of young salmon, or smolts, further 
illustrates how the unfavorable ocean conditions can have a negative effect on 
salmon. For the coho salmon population (a federally-protected salmon group) to 
remain stable, the minimum marine survival rate required is an estimated 2.7%. 
The survival rate is the percentage of salmon that make it to adulthood.</P>
<P>Dr. Kaczynski notes that this ocean survival rate directly corresponds with 
the salmon population levels. For example, between 1965 and 1975, the coho 
salmon survival rate was 6.7%. This was significantly above the minimum 2.7%, 
which explains why the salmon catch reached record levels in that period. After 
1975, the coho salmon survival rate started falling. Between 1991 and 1997, the 
coho's survival rate was a mere 1.2%, nowhere near the level to maintain a 
stable population. Dr. Kaczynski concludes that "coho marine survival was so 
poor in 1976, 1983-84, 1986, 1989, 1991-1997 that coastal coho salmon 
populations would have declined naturally even if there were no salmon fishing 
seasons."8</P>
<P>In another indication of the negative impact of the warmer ocean conditions, 
body sizes of surviving salmon have fallen from an average of 8.2 pounds 
recorded between 1970 and 1975, to only 6.2 pounds today. The reduction in body 
size means that females lay fewer eggs in the freshwater spawning areas, further 
reducing the population.</P>
<P>Another climatic event that affected the salmon population was the West Coast 
drought extending from the mid-1970s to 1993. The years 1987 to 1992 were the 
second driest in recorded California history. This is significant because when 
stream levels are lower, salmon survivability is reduced.</P>
<P>Rapid growth of the salmon population following the drought offers evidence 
of the drought's adverse effects. Two years after the drought ended in 
California in 1993, chinook salmon returned in remarkable numbers in several of 
the state's rivers. For example, the natural salmon population in the Klamath 
River is 97,000 adults. But by 1995, the population had soared to 200,000 - 
levels not seen since the 1960s.</P>
<P>Dr. Kaczynski concludes that the, "triple negative" of "adverse inland 
freshwater survival, estuary survival, and ocean survival... since 1976" explain 
the dramatic decline in the salmon population and man's unsuccessful efforts to 
reverse the trend 9</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>20-to-30-Year Cycle Controls Ocean Temperatures and Salmon 
Populations</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Historical records provide powerful evidence that the 23-year decline in 
salmon is natural and not the result of human activity. Salmon populations 
oscillate every 20-30 years and correlate precisely with rises and drops in 
ocean temperatures. Furthermore, the same cyclical changes in the ocean's 
temperature that reduce West Coast salmon populations significantly increase the 
population of Alaskan salmon. In fact, the Alaskan salmon catch has been at 
record levels since about 1976.10</P>
<P>This inverse correlation between West Coast salmon and Alaskan salmon is 
hardly new. It has existed for at least as long as fishing records have been 
kept. For example, in 1915, the Pacific Fisherman magazine reported that the 
Alaskan salmon catch was so low that "salmon packers returned to port" early. 
Yet, the publication also recorded that "The spring (chinook salmon) fishing 
season on the Columbia River (Washington and Oregon)... proved to be one of the 
best for some years." Twenty-four years later, however, the situation was 
reversed. The 1939 Alaskan salmon catch "was regarded as the greatest in 
history" while the Pacific Northwest salmon catch was "one of the lowest in the 
history of the Columbia." Then, just as dramatically, the situation again 
reversed. National Fisherman magazine reported that the 1972 Alaskan salmon 
catch was a "disaster" while the Columbia River salmon catch was the largest 
"since counting began in 1938."11</P>
<P>The current cycle benefits Alaska. While Alaska was experiencing its biggest 
salmon catch ever in 1994, the salmon numbers in the Pacific Northwest were so 
low that the Columbia spring chinook fishery had to be shut down and west coast 
troll fishing banned. So productive has the Alaskan salmon fishery been in 
recent years that during some years, millions of salmon were not even harvested 
because there was no market for the fish.12</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, politicians have been debating the periodic plight of 
Pacific Northwest salmon for at least 100 years. In his 1899 State of the State 
speech, Washington Governor John Rogers said, "The salmon fisheries of the state 
have, in the past, been wonderfully productive. Of late, however, evidence of a 
decrease in the run is apparent, and all are agreed that something ought to be 
done to prevent the final extinction of a great industry."13</P>
<P>The cyclical warming and cooling of the Northeast Pacific Ocean that governs 
salmon levels is the result of a phenomenon known as the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO). The PDO is an atmospheric event that occurs every 20 to 30 
years in which the wind circulation patterns in the Northeast Pacific Ocean 
shift, thereby changing ocean temperatures and the climate in Northwest North 
America. The oscillations are precipitated by the Aleutian Low, a 
quasi-permanent atmospheric pressure cell that covers much of the North Pacific 
from late fall to spring. The size and intensity of the Aleutian Low varies and 
it is this variance which causes the 20 to 30 year cycles that profoundly affect 
ocean conditions and salmon productivity.14</P>
<P>During the cool phase of the PDO, the period that is beneficial to West Coast 
salmon, the Aleutian Low weakens. The winds change in a westerly direction, 
which shifts a body of cool water to the Pacific Northwest Coast and causes the 
winters to become cooler and wetter throughout the region. In addition, the wind 
patterns bring colder, nutrient-bearing water to the surface - a phenomenon 
known as upwelling - which increases the food supply for phytoplankton and 
zooplankton. As a result, the phytoplankton and zooplankton populations increase 
- which means more food for salmon. Conversely, there is less rainfall in Alaska 
and a sharp decrease in the phytoplankton and zooplankton food supply due to a 
decrease in the upwelling of nutrient-bearing waters.15</P>
<P>During the PDO's warm phase that is so detrimental to salmon production in 
the Pacific Northwest, the Aleutian Low strengthens and moves eastward. The wind 
patterns change from a westerly to a southwesterly direction, the cool ocean 
water moves away from the North American coast to the central North Pacific, and 
the winters on the West Coast become warmer and drier. Alaska's weather, on the 
other hand, becomes wetter. The upwelling of nutrient-bearing cold water 
decreases off the West Coast, thereby lowering the phytoplankton and zooplankton 
food supply - and thus decreasing the amount of food available for salmon. Off 
of Alaska, upwelling of nutrient-rich waters increases, thereby increasing the 
phytoplankton and zooplankton food supply.16</P>
<P>There have been four periods in the 20th century when the PDO reversed 
itself: 1900-1924, a cool period good for Pacific Northwest salmon but bad for 
Alaskan salmon; 1925-1946, a warm period; 1947-1976, a cool period in which 
Pacific Salmon catches reached record highs; and the current warm period that 
began in 1977.17</P>
<P>Changes in winter precipitation have also had a significant impact on salmon. 
The infusion of warm air during the PDO's warm phase has opposite effects on 
winters in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. In Alaska, the warm, moist air 
increases the level of precipitation while in the Pacific Northwest the warm, 
humid air causes lower-than-average precipitation.18</P>
<P>The level of precipitation is vital for salmon because the more rain and 
snowfall, the higher the levels of freshwater streams that salmon need to spawn. 
Since the mid-1970s, higher precipitation resulting from the PDO's warm phase 
has significantly increased the water levels in Alaska's major salmon-bearing 
rivers. The discharge from Alaska's Kenai River, for example, is about 18% 
higher than during the cool period. By contrast, the water discharge on British 
Columbia's Skeena and Frasier Rivers and the Columbia River are 8%, 8% and 14% 
lower, respectively, than during the cool phase.19</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Freshwater Management Programs Cannot Compensate for Adverse Ocean 
Conditions</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>The immense influence of the oceanic cycle on salmon should give politicians 
and bureaucrats considerable pause before implementing costly policies that 
penalize people. Even if this natural cycle was not the culprit, the failure of 
past attempts to maintain or increase salmon populations suggest that a 
regulatory approach is not advisable.</P>
<P>After 1920, the Pacific Northwest salmon catch began to decline, consistent 
with the oceanic warming cycle that started about that time. Yet, that was when 
the first-ever harvest restrictions were put in place to protect the salmon from 
overfishing. Harvesting limits represented the first management strategy for 
reversing salmon decline.20</P>
<P>The Pacific Northwest's experience with hydroelectric power provides further 
evidence that man's influence on the salmon population is limited. Between 1932 
and 1975, 19 major dams were constructed on the Columbia and Snake Rivers while 
numerous other dams were built on the tributaries. Dams are believed to be 
detrimental to salmon because they destroy salmon spawning habitat and impede 
their ability to migrate on the rivers. But the salmon population jumped to 
record levels during the period between 1947 and 1976 - the salmon-friendly cool 
phase of the oceanic cycle. If human destruction of the salmon's freshwater 
habitat was as crucial as some people have contended, then the salmon population 
should not have dramatically increased during the period. Dam construction 
started when the salmon population was falling dramatically. Not only did the 
salmon population stabilize, but it rebounded to reach record levels by the 
early 1970s.</P>
<P>The years 1947 to 1976 were also a period of great economic growth in the 
region and development was infringing on the salmon habitat. The salmon's 
impressive population growth during this period strongly suggests that the 
oceanic cycle compensated for the adverse impact of hydrosystem development as 
well as other development that occurred during that time.21</P>
<P>The second management strategy adopted to reverse the salmon decline called 
for the installation of fish ladders and other additions to dams to ease salmon 
passage on the rivers. In addition, hatcheries were constructed to breed and 
then release salmon into the wild salmon population. By 1975, the five million 
pounds of hatchery smolts released into the Columbia River Basin equaled the 
adult catch.22</P>
<P>With the failure of hatcheries and fish ladders to reverse the salmon decline 
after 1975, a third management strategy was introduced that emphasized 
additional efforts to increase salmon migration. Money was spent on bypass 
facilities at dams to divert salmon from dangerous turbines, programs to 
transport Snake River salmon to below the Columbia River's Bonneville Dam and on 
other programs to speed salmon migration. To prevent any gains made through 
these efforts from being negated by fishing, harvest limits were 
established.23</P>
<P>At the very least, the salmon population should have stabilized at its 
mid-1970s level given the general improvement in hatchery practices, better 
agricultural conservation, continuous improvements in state and federal forest 
management practices and advances in wastewater treatment, according to 
University of Washington fish biologist James J. Anderson.24 Anderson points to 
studies showing transported salmon survival rates at more than 80%, an 
impressive figure. Other studies, Anderson notes, "show improving smolt passage 
survival since the early 1970s." Had the freshwater conditions of the salmon 
been as pivotal as claimed, there should have been no drop in the salmon 
population. Anderson concludes that the success of these management programs 
proves "that climate change negated (freshwater) passage improvements."25</P>
<P>An increasing number of fish biologists are also coming to the same 
conclusion that ocean survival rates, not the freshwater conditions, are the 
primary determinant in salmon population numbers. Dr. Ray Hilborn and Dr. 
Claribel Coronado of the Fisheries Research Institute at the University of 
Washington observe that it is time to rethink the "traditional explanations" 
that changes in salmon numbers are largely determined by the "4-Hs: Habitat, 
Harvest, Hatcheries and Hydropower." They conclude that fluctuations in the 
salmon population "can be explained by changes in ocean survival."26</P>
<P>W.G. Pearcy of the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon 
State University believes that 1983 marked a paradigm shift when scientists 
began to recognize that "ocean factors were important to salmon survival." 
Pearcy believes that the migration of predatory fishes such as mackerel and 
Pacific hake into the ocean off the Pacific Northwest during warm water 
conditions is the "most likely cause" of salmon depletion.27 Dr. Steven Hare of 
the Pacific Halibut Commission and Drs. Nathan Mantua and Robert Francis of the 
University of Washington conclude that the variability in ocean conditions is 
pivotal to salmon abundance and agree that salmon management programs on 
freshwater streams cannot compensate for the negative influences of the ocean.28 
While citing the need for continued improvements in freshwater management 
programs, these scientists believe that the only way West Coast salmon will 
rebound is when the PDO reverses itself and the ocean once again cools. Given 
the fact that the current warm phase began about 23 years ago, these scientists 
believe that the PDO cycle, which averages 20-to-30 years, will reverse itself 
within a decade.29</P>
<P>Indeed, the oceanic cycle could very well be changing to a cool period. As 
noted earlier, the decades-long drought, a consequence of warm ocean conditions, 
that affected the Pacific Northwest and California has ended. By 1995, the 
California salmon population was rebounding in great numbers. Dr. Kaczynski 
believes, "There is some evidence that Southern Oregon and Northern California 
coho salmon also began to exhibit increased survival relative to Northern Oregon 
coho salmon. And we appeared to be moving into a cool, wet inland climate cycle 
beginning in 1995."30</P>
<P>At the very moment then that the federal government is imposing a litany of 
costly ESA regulations to restore salmon populations, the same oceanic cycle 
that caused the decline is reversing itself, promising a rebound in the salmon 
population.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Politics, Not Science, Is Driving Salmon Issue</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>But as is too often the case with environmental issues, politics instead of 
science is setting the terms of the debate. Despite the emerging consensus in 
the scientific community about the preeminent role the ocean plays in salmon 
survivability and man's limited ability to counteract it, many elected officials 
and environmental activists continue to blame human activity.</P>
<P>The mayor of Seattle, Paul Schell, says: "The reasons for a declining salmon 
population can be summed up easily: We humans create too many competing uses for 
our rivers, streams and oceans. If you're looking for something to blame, it is 
the growth and development that surrounds us."31 Former Environmental Protection 
Agency Director Bill Ruckelshaus notes, "Over the last hundred years as people 
moved out here and developed this part of the country, we've forced the salmon 
to adjust to us... [The salmon ESA listings] will force us to adjust to the 
fish."32</P>
<P>Already, the White House and state governments are rushing to spend an 
additional $300 million dollars on salmon restoration projects - projects that 
scientists have said will, at best, have a limited impact on salmon population 
numbers. President Bill Clinton has proposed $100 million in spending for such 
things as river temperature control projects and dam removal.</P>
<P>Since salmon-friendly dams failed to halt the population decline, federal 
authorities now seem intent on getting rid of the dams altogether. On April 14, 
the NMFS proposed that four Snake River dams be destroyed because doing so might 
help the salmon. Even though federal officials acknowledge that destroying the 
dams may not make a difference, they are willing to proceed with the project in 
the face of strong opposition from farmers and barge operators who argue that 
the dams are critical to their livelihood.33 The state of Washington may even 
challenge the renewal of federal licenses for dams the state deems to be 
salmon-killers. There are 22 dams up for relicensing over the next 11 
years.34</P>
<P>Washington Governor Gary Locke has asked the state legislature for $201 
million to implement an aggressive salmon recovery plan.35 The governor's plan 
has yet to be acted on, but since March the state Senate has approved bills 
authorizing 13 state agencies to spend more than $600 million on a variety of 
salmon restoration programs.36</P>
<P>This barrage of federal and state funding would go to such salmon-restoration 
activities as planting trees, buying conservation easements, stabilizing stream 
banks, rebuilding culverts, mapping watersheds and monitoring restoration 
activities.37 Whatever other ecological merits these projects may have, one 
thing they will not achieve is restoring the salmon population while ocean 
conditions remain unfavorable.</P>
<P>Even more disturbing than the proliferation of wasteful spending, however, is 
the dire economic consequences that unneeded salmon regulations will have on the 
region's economy. A "Forest and Fish" agreement negotiated between the timber 
industry and Washington state and federal officials would place 15% of existing 
commercial timber permanently out of production, costing the industry up to $2.5 
billion in revenue over the next 50 years. The agreement, which is currently 
being considered by the state legislature, would impose rigorous regulations 
affecting 60,000 miles of streams on eight million acres of private forest 
land.38 The industry would be required to expand the no-cut buffer zones near 
streams to an average of 150 feet, a figure that still doesn't satisfy 
environmentalists.39</P>
<P>Already, farmers, developers and small property owners are feeling the pinch 
of ill-conceived salmon-restoration policies.</P>
<P>In Okanogan County, Washington, for example, NMFS officials are refusing to 
allow water to be released for irrigation because they haven't determined what 
impact the release would have on salmon. As a result, the county's farmers may 
lose their crops for the season.</P>
<P>On April 26, the Seattle City Council voted to delay for at least three 
months a developer's plan to build five homes over the water on Salmon Bay 
because the council wants to determine if the development would affect salmon. 
Says City Councilman Richard Conlin, "We want to do everything to protect the 
salmon." The Seattle Post-Intelligencer editorializes: "That is fair warning to 
developers that the worm has turned when it comes to new construction."40</P>
<P>The worm has apparently turned for small property owners as well. On April 
19, the environmental group Citizens for a Natural Habitat sued to block 
construction of a 51-house development on an 18-acre parcel in Lynnwood, 
Washington. They claim that a tiny stream, no more than ankle deep at its peak, 
is vital for salmon. Although salmon cannot swim in the stream, 
environmentalists claim that the stream feeds into larger streams inhabited by 
salmon, and this allegedly makes the tributaries just as vital.</P>
<P>The lawsuit threatens to bankrupt the two elderly women who own the 18-acre 
parcel. Delila Gribble, 82, who has owned a 10-acre portion of the property in 
question since the 1940s, says "If this doesn't get settled, I'm going to be in 
the poorhouse." Although she is prohibited from selling the land while 
litigation is in progress, she still must pay skyrocketing property taxes on 
it.</P>
<P>The situation is just as dire for Viola Allen, 72, the owner of the remaining 
8-acre portion, whose property taxes are also rising. Allen, who is in poor 
health and would like to move from her dilapidated house, can't leave unless she 
can sell the property.41</P>
<P>On April 28, a coalition of builders, farmers and cattlemen filed the first 
lawsuit challenging the federal government's decision to list salmon on the 
endangered species list. They charge that that government failed to take into 
account other factors, such as natural fluctuations in the salmon population, to 
explain the present decline.42</P>
<P>But environmentalists are ready to file lawsuits to enforce the salmon 
listings. "We won't hesitate to sue if salmon aren't protected," says Todd True 
of the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.43</P>
<P>Recreational activities are also being affected. On April 27, officials in 
the community of Mountlake Terrace, Washington cancelled an annual amateur 
water-skiing event out of concern the skiing might harm the salmon.44</P>
<P>And suburban residents will be affected too. Governor Locke's 
salmon-restoration plan includes water-use regulations that would sharply 
restrict the amount of water residents can use for the most basic activities. 
These regulations would dictate to homeowners how or if they can wash their 
cars, water their lawns, use fertilizer, build a tool shed, add a patio or 
engage in any other activity which can possibly create a runoff problem for 
salmon.45</P>
<P>The Pacific Northwest is going to pay a stiff price indeed for the 
government's failure to heed scientific research that concludes that nature, not 
man, has been hammering the region's salmon for the past two decades.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, environmental activists are also exploiting the salmon issue 
to advance a major component of their political agenda: stopping urban sprawl. 
The claim that urban sprawl - or economic development - is consuming much of the 
nation's farmland and open space is false given that less than 5% of the 
nation's land is developed and that the federal government has determined that 
our farm land acreage is sufficient for the foreseeable future.46 But urban 
sprawl is now a major issue for many Americans, so much so that Vice President 
Al Gore has made it one of his key issues this year.</P>
<P>Aaron Ostrom, executive director of 1,000 Friends of Washington, an 
anti-sprawl activist group, says: "The creeping blight of urban sprawl that is 
unraveling the character of our communities and fueling the traffic jams that 
make us miserable is also driving wild salmon into extinction... The key to 
saving salmon is protecting salmon habitat. Unfettered growth is polluting 
streams and rivers and mauling the land they flow through creating conditions 
that salmon can not survive."47</P>
<P>Seattle Mayor Paul Schell directly ties salmon protection to his policies to 
combat alleged sprawl. "We have purposely chosen to accept more density in our 
downtown area in order to protect open space around outlying streams and 
wetlands."48</P>
<P>King County Councilman Brian Derdowski, a slow-growth advocate, says, 
"Traffic congestion, crowded schools, high taxes, salmon, are all part of the 
same problem." Derdowski asserts, "The salmon will save ourselves from 
ourselves."49</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Conclusion</B></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>When will the politicians and other government officials start taking into 
consideration the scientific evidence that points to ocean conditions as the key 
factor determining salmon survivability?</P>
<P>They can't claim ignorance as a defense. The NMFS finally acknowledged in 
1998 that adverse inland climate and ocean conditions are at least partly 
responsible for the decline in the salmon population.50 But the NMFS and state 
bureaucracies are still implementing salmon policy based on the same assumptions 
of human impact that have been proven to be largely untrue.</P>
<P>No one can deny that reasonable measures should be taken to protect the 
salmon population, especially when natural conditions sharply lower survival. 
But there is no justification for mandating costly salmon-restoration policies 
that are ineffective in countering the effects of adverse ocean conditions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, salmon are not about to become extinct. The bitter irony of the 
recent ESA listing of West Coast salmon and the plethora of onerous regulations 
that will ensue is that the same ocean conditions that caused the precipitous 
decline beginning two decades ago is likely to soon reverse itself, promising a 
major rebound in the salmon population.</P>
<P>Salmon extinction, it turns out, is just another excuse to increase 
government control of the economy and constrict individuals' rights.<BR><BR></P>
