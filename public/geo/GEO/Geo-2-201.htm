      <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Ecological footprint</FONT></B> analysis is one 
      of the most important functions of the <A 
      href="http://www.global-vision.org/city/index.html">Sustainable City</A> 
      computer software. The environmental economist William E. Rees, Professor 
      of Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia 
      (and member of the <A 
      href="http://www.global-vision.org/city/advisors.html">Sustainable City 
      Advisory Committee</A>) defines the concept as follows:</P>
      <P>"The <STRONG>ecological footprint</STRONG> is the corresponding area of 
      productive land and aquatic ecosystems required to produce the 
      <STRONG>resources</STRONG> used, and to assimilate the 
      <STRONG>wastes</STRONG> produced, by a defined population at a specified 
      material standard of living, <STRONG>wherever on Earth that land may be 
      located</STRONG>."<BR>
      <P>Another member of our Advisory Committee, Sustainable London Trust 
      Co-Founder Herbert Girardet, has calculated that the footprint of London - 
      with 12% of Britain's population covering 170,000 hectares - comes to some 
      21 million hectares or 125 times the surface area of the city itself, 
      equivalent to the entire productive land in the UK!</P></TD></TR>

      <P>In his excellent paper: Revisiting Carrying Capacity: Area-Based 
      Indicators of Sustainability (in Population and Environment: a Journal of 
      Interdisciplinary Studies, Volume 17, Number 2, January 1996, Copyright © 
      1996 Human Sciences Press Inc.), William Rees explains:</P>
      <CENTER>
      <TABLE border=0 width="85%" VALIGN="TOP">
        <TBODY>
        <TR align=left>
          <TD>
            <P>"Since many forms of natural income (resource and service flows) 
            are produced by terrestrial ecosystems and associated water bodies, 
            it should be possible to estimate the area of land/water required by 
            a defined population at a given level of technology. The sum of such 
            calculations for all significant categories of consumption would 
            give us a conservative area-based estimate of the natural capital 
            requirements for that population.</P>
            <P>A simple mental exercise serves to illustrate the ecological 
            reality behind this approach. Imagine what would happen to any 
            modern human settlement or urban region, as defined by its political 
            boundaries or the area of built-up land, if it were enclosed in a 
            glass or plastic hemisphere completely closed to natural flows. 
            Clearly the city would cease to function and its inhabitants would 
            perish within a few days. The population and economy contained by 
            the capsule would have been cut off from both vital resources and 
            essential waste sinks, leaving it to starve and suffocate at the 
            same time. In other words, the ecosystems contained within our 
            imaginary human terrarium would have insufficient carrying capacity 
            to service the ecological load imposed by the contained 
            population.</P>
            <P>This mental model illustrates the simple fact that as a result of 
            high population densities, the enormous increase in <STRONG>per 
            capita</STRONG> energy and material consumption made possible by 
            (and required by) technology, and universally increasing 
            dependencies on trade, <STRONG>the ecological locations of human 
            settlements no longer co-incide with their geographic 
            locations</STRONG>. Twentieth century cities and industrial regions 
            are dependent for survival on a vast and increasingly global 
            hinterland of ecologically productive landscapes. It seems that in 
            purely ecological terms, modern settlements have become the human 
            equivalent of cattle feedlots!</P>
            <P>Cities necessarily appropriate the ecological output and life 
            support functions of distant regions all over the world through 
            commercial trade and the natural biogeochemical cycles of energy and 
            material. Indeed, the annual flows of natural income required by any 
            defined population can be called its <STRONG>appropriated carrying 
            capacity</STRONG>. Since for every material flow there must be a 
            corresponding land/ecosystem source or sink, the total area of 
            land/water required to sustain these flows on a continuous basis is 
            the true <STRONG>ecological footprint</STRONG> of the referent 
            population on the Earth."<BR></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
      <P>Rees' ecological footprint analysis of his home city of Vancouver, 
      Canada, indicates that city appropriates the productive output of an land 
      area nearly 174 times larger that its political area to support its 
      present consumer lifestyle. Other researchers found that the aggregate 
      consumption of wood, paper, fibre and food by the inhabitants of 29 cities 
      in the Baltic Sea drainage basin appropriates an area 200 times larger 
      than the cities themselves. Rees estimates that the footprint of the 
      Netherlands appropriates between 100,000 sq. kilometres and 140,000 square 
      kilometres of agricultural land, mostly in the third world, for food 
      production alone. He goes on to say:</P>
      <CENTER>
      <TABLE border=0 width="85%" VALIGN="TOP">
        <TBODY>
        <TR align=left>
          <TD>
            <P>"This 'imported land' is five to seven times larger than the area 
            of Holland's domestic arable land... It is worth remembering that 
            Holland, like Japan, is often held up as an economic success story 
            and an example for the developing world to follow. Despite small 
            size, few natural resources, and relatively large populations, both 
            Holland and Japan enjoy high material standards and positive current 
            accounts and trade balances as measured in monetary terms. However, 
            our analysis of physical flows shows that these and most other 
            so-called "advanced" economies are running massive, unaccounted 
            ecological deficits with the rest of the planet... Even if their 
            land area were twice as productive as world averages, many European 
            countries would still run a deficit more than three times larger 
            than domestic natural income. These data emphasise that (most 
            developed countries) are over-populated in ecological terms - they 
            could not maintain themselves at current material standards if 
            forced by changing circumstances to live on their remaining 
            endowments of domestic natural capital. This is hardly a good model 
            for the rest of the world to 
      follow!"</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
      <P>Research by <B>The Earth Council</B> in 1997 indicated that the 10 most 
      unsustainable nations in ascending order of <FONT color=#ff0000>ecological 
      deficit per capita</FONT> are: Switzerland, Israel, Japan, Germany, United 
      Kingdom, the USA, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

      <P>William Rees explains this concept further:</P>
      <CENTER>

        <TBODY>
        <TR align=left>
          <TD>
            <P>"Ecological deficits are a measure of the entropic load and 
            resultant 'disordering' being imposed on the ecosphere by so-called 
            advanced countries as the unaccounted cost of maintaining and 
            further expanding their wealthy consumer economies. This massive 
            entropic imbalance invokes what might be called the first axiom of 
            ecological footprint analysis: On a finite planet, not all countries 
            or regions can be net importers of carrying capacity. This, in turn, 
            has serious implications for global development trends.</P>
            <P>The current objective of international development is to raise 
            the developing world to present first world materials standards. To 
            achieve this objective, the Brundtland Commission argued for 'more 
            rapid economic growth in both industrial and developing countries' 
            and suggested that 'a five to ten-fold increase in world industrial 
            output can be anticipated by the time world population stabilises 
            some time in the next century.' (WCED, 1987).</P>
            <P>Let us examine this prospect using ecological footprint analysis. 
            If just the present [i.e. January 1996 - ed.] world population of 
            5.8 billion people were to live at current North American ecological 
            standards (say 4.5 ha/person), a reasonable first approximation of 
            the total productive land requirement would be 26 billion hectares 
            (assuming present technologies). However, there are only just over 
            13 billion hectares of land on Earth, of which only 8.8 billion are 
            ecologically productive cropland, pasture, or forest (1.5 
            ha/person). In short, we would need an additional two planet Earths 
            to accommodate the increased ecological load of people alive today. 
            If the population were to stabilise at between 10 and 11 billion 
            sometime in the next century, five additional Earths would be 
            needed, all else being equal - and this just to maintain the present 
            rate of ecological decline (Rees and Weinberger, 1994).</P>
            <P>While this may seem to be an astonishing result, empirical 
            evidence suggests that five phantom planets is, in fact, a 
            considerable underestimate (keep in mind that our footprint 
            estimates are conservative). Global and regional-scale ecological 
            change in the form of atmospheric change, ozone depletion, soil 
            loss, ground water depletion, deforestation, fisheries collapse, 
            loss of biodiversity, etc., is accelerating. This is direct evidence 
            that aggregate consumption exceeds natural income in certain 
            critical categories and that the carrying capacity of this one Earth 
            is being steadily eroded. In short, the ecological footprint of the 
            present world population/economy already exceeds the total 
            productive land area (or ecological space) available on Earth.</P>
            <P>This situation is, of course, largely attributable to consumption 
            by that wealthy quarter of the world's population who use 75% of 
            global resources. The WCED's 'five to ten-fold increase in 
            industrial output' was deemed necessary to address this obvious 
            inequity while accommodating a much larger population. However, 
            since the world is already ecologically full, sustainable growth on 
            this scale using present technology would require five to ten 
            additional planets."<BR></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
