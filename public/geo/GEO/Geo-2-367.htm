            <P><FONT size=3>Interest in fuel management, to reduce fire control 
            costs and damages, bas been renewed with the numerous, destructive 
            wildfires spread across the West during the summers of 1988 and 
            1994. Fuel management is often linked to forest health, since major 
            forest health concerns include excess biomass (i.e., fuel loadings) 
            and catastrophic fires. Several tools, such as prescribed burning 
            and salvage timber sales, can address these problems, but the extent 
            of the problem and the cost of needed treatments are generally 
            unknown. Fuel management may well reduce fire control costs and 
            damages, but the evidence is largely anecdotal, with few documented 
            estimates of the decline in control costs and/or damages associated 
            with fuel treatments. Finally, the roles and responsibilities of the 
            federal and state governments in fire protection may be subject to 
            further debate.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>

      <P><FONT size=3><B>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The 1988 and 1994 fire seasons saw numerous large 
      wildfires, with the deaths of several firefighters and the destruction of 
      many structures in 1994. Many observers suggested that the extent and 
      severity of the fires was largely due to the poor health of the national 
      forests of the West.</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#1"><FONT 
      size=3><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> These observers argue that 
      activities to improve forest health by reducing fuel loadings will also 
      reduce fire control costs and fire damages. This report describes fuel 
      management and its benefits for controlling wildfires and for reducing 
      fire damages, and discusses the relative roles and</FONT><FONT size=2> 
      </FONT><FONT size=3>responsibilities of the federal and state governments 
      in wildfire protection.</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#2"><FONT 
      size=3><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></A></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><B>FUEL MANAGEMENT</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The Forest Service began moving into fuel management in 
      the 1960s, to reduce the net cost of wildfires to society. Although 
      numerous techniques can be used, one of the most common is prescribed 
      burning -- intentionally setting fires within established control 
      boundaries under prescribed conditions to burn the existing fuels when and 
      where the fire can be contained. Occasionally, weather conditions change, 
      and prescribed fires escape, causing unanticipated damages; for example, 
      the Mack Lake fire in Michigan in May 1980 was a prescribed fire that 
      escaped and killed one person and destroyed 44 homes and 
      buildings</FONT><FONT size=2><SUP>.</SUP></FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#3"><FONT 
      size=2><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> Despite the obvious risks, 
      however, prescribed burning can be an efficient tool for reducing 
      small-diameter fuels at or near ground level.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Salvage timber operations can also be used to reduce fuel 
      loadings. The Timber Salvage Sale Fund is a self-financing, permanently 
      appropriated special account, with receipts from designated salvage sales 
      deposited into the account for use in preparing and administering future 
      salvage sales (and for road construction associated with those salvage 
      sales).</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#4"><FONT 
      size=2><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> To the extent that salvage 
      Bales remove woody materials from the forest, they can be considered fuel 
      management activities. Furthermore, they can be legitimate tools for 
      achieving desired forest health conditions.</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#5"><FONT 
      size=3><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> However, because they have to 
      be sold, salvage sales must focus at least partially on removing 
      merchantable wood, and reducing fuel loads or achieving desired forest 
      conditions could be compromised. At a minimum, salvage sales are 
      insufficient to fulfill the latter goals. In addition, salvage sales can 
      be costly to the U.S. Treasury; they often cost more than the revenues 
      they can generate, because timber quality is lower and operating costs for 
      the buyers are higher.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Other tools for reducing fuel loadings also exist. 
      Pruning, precommercial thinning, and mechanical or chemical release can 
      reduce live biomass and make it more susceptible to elimination, naturally 
      (through decomposition or wildfire) or in prescribed fires. However, these 
      tools are less commonly used because of their relatively high 
      costs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Finally, the possible extent of fuel management and forest 
      health activities is largely undefined. To date, the discussions of 
      prescribed burning, salvage sales, and other fuel management or forest 
      health activities have identified neither the acreage needing treatment 
      nor the likely treatment costs. Treatment costs probably range from less 
      than $100 to more than $1,000 per acre; "average" costs may be about $250 
      per acre. If 10% of the National Forest System lands in the coterminous 
      western States -- about 14 million acres -- were treated, total treatment 
      costs would be $3.5 billion, roughly equal to the annual Forest Service 
      budget. However, these "guesstimates" are very coarse; needed treatments 
      might cost less than $1 billion or more than $10 billion, and could be 
      spread over a decade or more.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><B>FIRE CONTROL</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>In general, when wildfires occur, the fire organization 
      swings into full gear to try to stop them. For</FONT><FONT size=4><B> 
      </B></FONT><FONT size=3>several years, beginning in the late 1970s, the 
      Forest Service</FONT><FONT size=4><I> </I></FONT><FONT size=3>and the 
      National Park Service had "prescribed natural fire" policies. In 
      wilderness areas and Park System units with fire management plans, 
      wildfires burning within prescribed situations were monitored, rather than 
      aggressively suppressed. (These policies have been colloquially known as 
      "let-burn" policies.) In recognition of the financial and environmental 
      costs of total fire suppression, those policies permitted the use of 
      wildfires to achieve the goals of prescribed fires. Following the 
      Yellowstone fires in 1988, however, the use of prescribed natural fire was 
      halted. While one can question whether the prescriptions were sufficiently 
      responsive to burning conditions (fuel moisture, precipitation, dry 
      lightning, winds, etc.), the termination of prescribed natural fire 
      policies may have been an overreaction to the public sentiment.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The public outcry over the fires in Yellowstone and during 
      the summer of 1994 is, in</FONT><FONT size=4><B> </B></FONT><FONT 
      size=3>part, a result of the belief that all wildfires can be controlled. 
      This belief is widespread, internally as well as among the public, because 
      of our general success in controlling structural fires in urban and 
      suburban areas and because all wildfires eventually go out. However, most 
      fire experts agree that, because of fuel types and loadings, topography, 
      and temporary weather conditions (lasting a few hours to several weeks), 
      some fires simply cannot be stopped and some cannot even be influenced. 
      Substantial funds are spent on efforts to suppress wildfires that only 
      stop because of a change in the fuel type or more commonly in the weather. 
      Such efforts contribute to the belief in our ability to stop all 
      wildfires, and lead the public to believe that damages from wildfires only 
      occur because of the Government has been inefficient and 
      ineffective.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The desire to control all wildfires has also led to a 
      belief that fast, aggressive control efforts are efficient, because fires 
      that are stopped while small will not become the large, damaging, fearsome 
      fires that are so expensive to control. The belief in efficiency of fast, 
      aggressive fire control was embodied in the 10-acre and 10:00 a.m. 
      policies of the </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=3>1930s.</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#6"><FONT 
      face=Arial size=3><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> 
      </FONT><FONT size=3>However, only a fraction of fire ignitions ever become 
      catastrophic fires, even without fire suppression. These 10-acre and 10:00 
      a.m. policies were terminated in the late 1970s, because research 
      documented that the policies led to organization size and efforts that far 
      outweighed the benefits of fire control.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The preferred technique to evaluate the economics of fire 
      control, and of fuel management, is known as 
      'least-cost-plus-loss."</FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#7"><FONT 
      size=3><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> This approach, in essence, 
      asserts that fire control is only justified by the damage prevented. 
      Little or no fire control is economically justified for wildfires that are 
      doing little or no damage (the under-lying idea for the prescribed natural 
      fire policies) or for wildfires that cannot be controlled (because no 
      damage can be prevented). Similarly, fuel management is justified only 
      when the treatment costs are less than the benefits, either in reduced 
      control expenditures or in reduced damages. (See below.) Proponents of 
      forest health activities often assert that reduced fuel loads can reduce 
      fire control costs and damages. This assertion is logical, and is 
      supported by some anecdotal evidence. However, there appears to be <I>very 
      </I>little research documentation of widespread fire control savings from 
      fuel treatment, which is essential to demonstrate the merit of forest 
      health activities for fire control savings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><B>WILDFIRE EFFECTS</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Wildfires can damage lands and resources. Timber is 
      burned, although some may be salvageable. Existing forage, for livestock 
      and wildlife, is destroyed. The reduced vegetation can increase erosion; 
      in severe situations, such as southern California, the result can be mud 
      slides when the wet season returns. And the burned areas are not 
      pretty.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The damages of wildfires on lands and resources are often 
      overstated, for two reasons. First, fires are patchy, leaving unburned 
      areas within the fire perimeter. Thus, reports of acres burned, typically 
      calculated from the perimeter, overstate the actual acres burned by 10 to 
      50%, depending on local vegetative, weather, and other 
      conditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Damages are also usually overstated, because fires do not 
      destroy every living thing within the burned areas. Mature conifers can 
      survive even when their entire crowns are scorched; a few species, notably 
      lodgepole pine and jack pine, are serotinous -- their cones will only open 
      and spread their seeds when they have been exposed to the heat of a 
      wildfire. Grasses and other plants are often benefited by wildfire, 
      because fire quickly decomposes organic matter into its mineral components 
      (a process that, in the arid West, may require years or decades without 
      fire), and the flush of nutrients accelerates plant growth for a few 
      growing seasons. Few animals are killed by even the most severe wildfires, 
      rather, many animals seek out burned sites for the newly available 
      minerals and for the flush of plant growth. And erosion is typically far 
      worse along the fire control lines than from the broad burned areas. The 
      recognition of these ecological benefits from fire was a major factor in 
      the end of the 10-acre and 10:00 a.m. policies and their replacement with 
      fuel management and prescribed fire (natural and otherwise).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Nonetheless, the net damages from wildfires are generally 
      greater when fires burn more intensely. Thus, lower fuel loads may reduce 
      the net damages caused by wildfires. Proponents argue that forest health 
      activities to reduce fuel loads also reduce wildfire damages. Again, this 
      assertion is logical, and is supported by some anecdotal evidence, but 
      there appears to be very little research documenting widespread reduction 
      in wildfire damages from fuel treatment. Such evidence is critical, 
      however, to justify of forest health activities from lower fire 
      damage<SUP> </SUP></FONT><A 
      href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Forests/for-23.cfm#8"><FONT 
      size=3><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Finally, it should be noted that emergency rehabilitation 
      occurs following most of the large, severe wildfires. While emergency 
      activities can prove beneficial, especially for erosion control, they may 
      inhibit the restoration of natural ecological processes. In particular, 
      grasses are often seeded in severely burned areas. However, the 
      quick-growing grasses typically used may not be native to the area, and 
      some grasses suppress tree seedling establishment and growth. Thus, while 
      solving some environmental problems, emergency rehabilitation may cause 
      other problems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><B>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>The federal government clearly has a responsibility for 
      fire protection on the federal lands. The responsibility for protecting 
      homes and structures on private lands in and around the federal lands, 
      however, is less clear. In general, the States are responsible for fire 
      protection on non-federal lands, although cooperative agreements may shift 
      those responsibilities (especially when a realignment is efficient). It 
      may be appropriate to maintain some separation, because of structures on 
      non-federal lands and the differences between structural fires and 
      wildfires. (Structural firefighters use different techniques and face 
      different hazards from wildfire fighters, but basic federal firefighting 
      courses focus on fighting wildfires.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Furthermore, the Forest Service has a cooperative fire 
      protection program within its State and Private Forestry branch. This 
      includes: (1) financial and technical assistance to state and other 
      governmental organizations; (2) equipment loans of excess federal personal 
      property; and (3) cooperative fire prevention to provide a nationwide fire 
      prevention program through public service advertising, education, 
      partnerships, and other efforts. FY1995 appropriations for cooperative 
      fire protection were $13.7 million, and the budget request for FY1997 is 
      $17.0 million; however, Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton have proposed 
      eliminating the financial assistance program several times.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Another question is about the relative priorities in 
      wildfire suppression. Assuming that the fires can be controlled, should 
      federal firefighting decisions include values at risk on adjoining or 
      surrounded non-federal lands?8 If so, this is effectively federal fire 
      protection for certain private lands and structures. If not, the federal 
      government may be liable for damages to private lands and structures from 
      wildfires originating on the federal lands -- essentially free federal 
      fire insurance. In either case, it raises the question of whether federal 
      responsibility warrants federal regulation -- if the federal government is 
      responsible for fire protection and/or insurance, then regulating building 
      materials, site clearing and planting, road construction and access, etc. 
      might be appropriate to constrain federal costs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><STRONG>REFERENCES</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><A name=1><FONT size=2><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></A><FONT size=3> It is 
      widely accepted that livestock grazing, timber harvesting, and fire 
      suppression over the past century have led to unnatural conditions -- 
      excessive biomass (too many trees and dead woody material) and altered 
      species mix -- in the pine forests of the West; these conditions make the 
      forests more susceptible to drought; insect and disease epidemics, and 
      other forest-wide catastrophes (including large wildfires).</FONT></P>
