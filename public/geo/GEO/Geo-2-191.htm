    <TD width="100%"><FONT size=4><B>Summary</B></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=3>The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), enacted in 1985, 
      enables producers to bid to retire highly erodible or environmentally 
      sensitive cropland, usually for 10 years. Participants receive annual 
      rental and cost-sharing payments, and technical assistance to install 
      approved plantings. Up to 36.4 million acres have been enrolled; current 
      enrollment is estimated to be 32.9 million acres. The initial contracts 
      started to expire in 1995. The program has broad support.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3>Congress reauthorized and amended the CRP in the 1996 farm 
      bill. The Department filed a final rule implementing the amendments, 
      effective on February 12, 1997. This rule, which modified many aspects of 
      an earlier proposal, was widely anticipated in farm country, where 
      producers were anxious to learn about the characteristics of the revised 
      program as they plan for their farm operation in the future. 
      Implementation is of great interest to others because of competing views 
      about the eventual size and characteristics of the land enrolled in 
      reserve.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=4><B>Background</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Before CRP</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Agricultural exports expanded rapidly through the 1970s to 
record levels, and producers responded by bringing additional land into 
production. Excessive rates of erosion, characterized as rivaling those of the 
1930s dust bowl, were one byproduct of this expansion. When the boom ended in 
the early 1980s, producers were left with excess capacity and insufficient 
markets. Compounding woes for farmers was a widespread farm credit crisis with 
deflating land values. Federal programs at that time allowed annual set asides, 
but did not include any multi-year efforts that could provide more enduring 
benefits for either conservation or the producer's bottom line.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>The CRP Before the 1996 Farm Bill</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Congress enacted the CRP to fill this void. Program proponents 
sought to reduce excessive erosion, stabilize land prices, and slow chronic 
excess production. Of these benefits, erosion control was the most prominent. 
CRP allows producers who cultivate highly erodible or environmentally sensitive 
land to bid to retire it from annual production for 10 years (or longer in 
limited instances). Participants receive rental and cost sharing payments from 
the Farm Services Agency (FSA) and technical assistance from the Natural 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In administering the program, FSA has allowed enrollment only 
through signups during specified time periods. It has held a total of 14 
signups, but only two since 1992. FSA decides which bids to accept, based on 
both the federal dollars available, and a comparison of the costs and benefits 
of each bid.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The 1985 legislation's goal was to enroll between 40 and 45 
million acres of cropland, about 10% of the national total, before 1995. By 
1990, almost 34 million acres had been enrolled in 9 signups. The 1990 farm bill 
did not change the acreage goal but included within this total lands to be 
enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Program (1 million acres). Enrollment since 1990 
has brought the total as high as 36.4 million acres. During this period, the 
enrollment cap was lowered to 38 million acres to create a budget savings in 
reconciliation legislation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Congress has repeatedly mandated that USDA change criteria for 
participation and procedures for program operation, with significant redirection 
in the 1990 farm bill, minor adjustments in other legislation, and directives in 
appropriations legislation. Initially, FSA limited the criterion for acceptance 
to erosion reduction. More than 22 million acres were enrolled in 1986 and 1987 
under this criterion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Since 1988, FSA has repeatedly altered the program's formula for 
accepting bids with a growing emphasis on various environmental benefits. 
Congress endorsed this changing emphasis in amendments in the 1990 farm bill. 
The land enrolled in more recent signups reflect these changes. Since the 10th 
signup, bids have been compared using a formula called the Environmental 
Benefits Index (EBI). Factors considered in the initial EBI included:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size=3> Surface water quality improvement;<BR> Potential ground 
    water quality improvement;<BR> Preservation of soil quality;<BR> 
    Assistance to farmers most affected by conservation compliance;<BR> Tree 
    planting;<BR> Enrollment in identified hydrologic unit areas; and<BR> 
    Enrollment in conservation priority areas.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Until the contracts started to expire, new signups could be held 
only when Congress appropriated the necessary funds, which has not happened 
since FY1992. The Department used existing authority in 1995 to allow producers 
to terminate their contracts prematurely, then replace the terminated acres. 
Approximately 684,000 acres were replaced in the 13th signup. In 1996, it again 
offered an early-out option. Holders of contracts on an estimated 605,000 acres 
chose this option. Enrolled lands with especially high erosion rates or that 
provide certain environmental benefits, totaling about 14 million acres, were 
not eligible for the early-out option. Many more producers had been expected to 
use the early-out option, given high commodity prices and generous federal 
commodity payments.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>The CRP Today</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>CRP participation currently is concentrated in the drier 
portions of the Great Plains; states with the most enrolled acres are Texas 
(about 4 million acres) and North Dakota (about 3 million acres). As the EBI is 
applied and older contracts concentrated in arid areas expire, the center of 
participation may move toward the East. The 1985 law set a participation ceiling 
at 25% of the cropland in a county, capping participation in numerous plains 
counties. Also, participants have planted 2.4 million acres to trees, making the 
CRP the largest federal tree planting program in history. Tree acreage is 
concentrated in the Southeast, with half of the acreage in Georgia and 
Mississippi.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The CRP has been effective in reducing erosion and providing 
other benefits. Average erosion on all enrolled acres has declined from more 
than 20 tons to about 2 tons per acre per year, according to NRCS statistics. 
Viewed another way, this program has reduced overall erosion nationwide by more 
than 22% (an estimated 700 million tons per year) although less than 10% of the 
cropland is enrolled in the program. Other conservation benefits NRCS has 
documented include 8,500 miles of filter strips, 1.7 million acres of wildlife 
practices, and more than 30 million acres devoted to grassland cover.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>After a contract expires, Federal payments cease and producers 
are under no further obligation to maintain the conservation values established 
under the contract. The Department allowed participants to extend expiring 
contracts for one year in 1995 and again in 1996, pending implementation of the 
reauthorized CRP. As a result, contracts will expire on nearly 23 million acres 
on September 30, 1997. Language in the FY1997 agriculture appropriations 
legislation prohibits another extension. Past participants who decide to plant 
annual commodities on land that is defined as highly erodible (about 75% of the 
enrolled land meets this definition) risk losing farm program benefits if they 
do not fully implement an approved conservation plan in two years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The CRP is a costly program. Current annual costs are slightly 
below $2 billion. Cumulative costs, before changes in the 1996 amendments, were 
estimated to be slightly below $20 billion. Proponents argue that these costs 
are offset by its conservation and environmental benefits. Estimates of the 
annual value of these benefits have ranged from slightly less than $1 billion to 
more than $1.5 billion. Some analysts estimate that the value of the benefits 
approach or exceed program costs in some areas.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Given both the large federal investment made in the CRP and the 
extensive benefits this investment has purchased, what contract holders plan to 
do on these lands is of great interest. The most recent large survey of these 
plans, conducted in late 1993, found that holders intended to return 63% of 
their enrolled acres (about 23 million acres) to crop production. These data 
provide a snapshot of holder intent, but changing conditions and expectations 
may alter the thinking of many during the several years that contracts are 
expiring. High prices or expanding markets will attract more interest in crop 
production, while shrinking markets or low prices will encourage more producers 
to retain conserving uses. These decisions will vary by commodity, by region, 
and by year.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>The 1996 Farm Bill</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Discussions of what to do next began during the 103rd Congress 
in anticipation that the earliest contracts would expire before a 1995 farm bill 
could be enacted. The House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on the 
Environment held several hearings on the CRP. Subcommittee Chair Tim Johnson of 
South Dakota formed a bipartisan group to work for reauthorizing the program 
after 1995.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Most interest groups that expressed a view on CRP during these 
hearings and throughout the farm bill debate supported reauthorization. Groups 
differed, however, as to the exact form that a continued program should take. 
Farm groups in many states and many national farm organizations recommended that 
modifications be minimal. Environmental groups generally sought to add more 
acreage that would provide water quality and other environmental benefits, while 
wildlife groups sought larger blocks of land for habitat. The only opposition to 
CRP came from a coalition of large grain processors and related businesses who 
sought to maximize grain supplies and lower market prices.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Some interests expressed concern that if the program was not 
reauthorized, a substantial portion of the land currently retired would return 
to production, negating many of the environmental and conservation benefits and 
lowering some commodity prices. Many in Congress shared these concerns, and the 
decision to continue the program was never in doubt. As finally enacted in the 
1996 farm bill, the Congress made several changes, but left decisions on 
priorities for future enrollment largely to the Department. The changes 
include:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size=3> Making the CRP an entitlement financed by the Commodity 
    Credit Corporation and extending program authority through 2002,<BR> 
    Limiting maximum enrollment at any time to 36.4 million acres,<BR> Allowing 
    contracts on land that does not contain high environmental values or high 
    erosion potential and that has been enrolled at least 5 years before 
    enactment to be terminated with 60 days' notice, and<BR> Limiting 
    conservation requirements for land returning to production to those that are 
    placed on similar lands.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Congress set a 90-day deadline for issuing rules; they should 
have been issued in early July. It set a tight deadline because many farmers 
will make basic farming decisions based on their ability to participate in the 
CRP program. The Department missed the July deadline, but issued interim rules, 
generally making adjustments to the existing program, on August 27, 1996. One 
major change under these rules replaced enrollments during signup periods with 
continuous enrollment for lands that offer specified high environmental 
benefits, including filter strips, riparian buffers, shelter belts, living snow 
fences, field windbreaks, grassed waterways, salt tolerant vegetation, and 
shallow water areas for wildlife.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The Department's delay in the rule-making process has troubled 
many in Congress. Members of the House Agriculture Committee expressed their 
concerns at a September 19, 1996 oversight hearing. Proposed rules to implement 
provisions in the 1996 farm bill were released four days after the hearing, on 
September 23, 1996. Final rules went into effect on February 12, 1997. This 
program attracts considerable interest; almost 3,500 comments were submitted in 
response to the proposed rule, and the Department was lobbied intensively in 
anticipation of decisions that were made public in the February announcement of 
the final rule.</FONT></P>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=4><B>Implementation Issues</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Eligible Acres</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The final rule makes an estimated 230 to 240 million acres 
eligible for the Reserve. Eligible acres must have been planted or were 
considered to have been planted in at least 2 of the past 5 years. Eligible land 
also includes certain marginal cropland. Eligible land must also meet at least 
one of the following criteria:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size=3> Have an Erosion Index (EI) greater than 8, or be 
    considered highly erodible land under the conservation compliance 
    provisions;<BR> Be considered a cropped wetland;<BR> Be devoted to a 
    highly beneficial environmental practice, such as filter strips, riparian 
    buffers, grass waterways, shelter belts, or wetland protection areas;<BR> 
    Be subject to scour erosion;<BR> Be located in a national or state priority 
    area for the CRP; or<BR> Be cropland associated with or surrounding 
    non-cropped wetlands.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>While national priority areas have been used before, 
state-designated priority areas are being used for the first time. NRCS has 
already designated them for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). 
States may designate up to 10 percent of their cropland as priority areas. In 
addition, three national priority areas were designated in farm legislation, 
including drainages that feed into Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay and the 
Great Lakes. The Department then designated the Prairie Potholes as a fourth 
national priority area.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Accepting Bids</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The characteristics of land in the reserve will be largely 
determined by application of an environmental benefits index to compare the 
benefits of bids. This index will decide the future shape of the program in the 
15th signup, to be held during March 1997, as contracts on about 22 million 
acres will end September 30, 1997. (New contracts for acreage under contracts 
that expire on September 30, 1997 will take effect on October 1, 1997; for other 
contracts, each participant can choose an effective date of October 1, 1997 or 
1998.) The index includes:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size=3> Cost to enroll the acres;<BR> Wildlife habitat 
    benefits;<BR> Water quality benefits;<BR> On-farm benefits from reduced 
    erosion;<BR> Likely long-term benefits beyond the contract period, such as 
    from planting trees;<BR> Air quality benefits from reduced wind erosion; 
    and<BR> Benefits of enrollment in conservation priority areas help to 
    improve adverse water quality, wildlife habitat, or air 
  quality.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>The Department has assigned point totals to each of these 
categories. Excluding cost, a total of 400 points is theoretically possible, 
with up to 100 points for wildlife habitat, water quality and soil erosion, up 
to 50 points for benefits beyond the contract period, and up to 25 points for 
air quality benefits and enrolling land in priority areas. Costs do not have a 
points scale, although lower costs and higher benefits will receive a higher 
rating, and 10 points will be credited for sites that do not need cost-sharing 
assistance to meet the CRP contract requirements. States also have the option of 
developing their own ranking process to address particular concerns. Four 
states, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oregon, chose this alternative for the 
13th signup. States choosing this option would determine which bids to accept 
based on the ranking and the allocation to the state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The 1996 farm bill requires that rental rates be limited to 
local market values. FSA has prepared state maps that show the maximum 
acceptable county rates. These rates can be adjusted for site-specific 
productivity factors. In addition, the rental rate can include an incentive of 
up to $5 per acre per year to perform certain maintenance obligations. A review 
of some of the rental rate maps, which were prepared at the local and state 
levels, show some apparent inconsistencies across state boundaries. The 
availability of these maps should give each bidder a clear indication of the 
upper boundary of an acceptable bid. There is a widespread concern that these 
rates will be less than many producers will be willing to accept.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>For the first time, all eligible land will no longer receive the 
same treatment. Continuous enrollments will give certain lands that provide 
these specified benefits much easier access to this program. Continuous 
enrollments would be halted only if the enrollment ceiling is exceeded. Every 
acre enrolled in this process will be an acre that can not be added during 
signup periods. High interest in continuous enrollment may squeeze out 
opportunities for others. While the continuous enrollment has been available for 
several months, FSA does not have data on participation. An FSA representative 
stated that participation has been limited, but that participation will increase 
rapidly after the farm community learns of it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Soil erosion will be considered in a different way than in 
earlier signups. All eligible acreage under the erosion criteria must exceed an 
erodibility index of 8 or be considered highly erodible and subject to 
conservation compliance. Land currently enrolled that would not be eligible in 
the future is estimated to total more than 8 million acres, and is concentrated 
in a few states. For example, 600,000 acres in Kansas and 1 million acres in 
North Dakota would not be eligible. But the program will still have a large pool 
to draw on as, nationwide, more than 140 million acres will be eligible under 
the erosion criteria.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Congressional Interest in 
Implementation</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Congress will closely monitor implementation of the CRP. While 
the CRP, as a concept, continues to enjoy bipartisan support, several specifics 
about implementation seem likely to attract congressional scrutiny. One is what 
priorities will be given in deciding which land can participate, and how might 
the characteristics of participating lands change from earlier enrollments. 
While the release of the EBI and the publication of rental rates by county 
provide some basis for comparison, only about 15% of the eligible land can be 
enrolled before the CRP reaches its ceiling. A second one is the way the 
Department maintains the size of the reserve in the future; the 1996 farm bill 
set the 36.4 million acre ceiling. The Department has stated that it anticipates 
that the reserve will drop to about 30 million acres, then gradually increase to 
the maximum allowable size by 2002.</FONT></P><!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="crsfoot.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
