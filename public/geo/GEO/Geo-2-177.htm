      &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT color=#006a5a size=+4>The Strategy</FONT></P>
      <P><I>Agriculture in Harmony with Nature</I> describes how Agriculture and 
      Agri-Food Canada will work with its partners &shy; in the sector, in other 
      federal and provincial agencies, and in the academic and environment 
      communities &shy; as well as with other Canadians to further advance 
      environmentally sustainable agriculture and agri-food production in 
      Canada. It is intended to help decision makers in the sector and the 
      department to integrate environmental considerations into their day-to-day 
      management.</P>
      <P>The strategy recognizes the interest of Canada's agriculture and 
      agri-food sector in promoting sustainable development and builds on its 
      previous successes in adopting environmentally sustainable practices. The 
      strategy's three-year action plan will be carried out in many ways such as 
      by undertaking agri-environmental and economic analysis, conducting 
      research, developing and demonstrating new technologies, exploring new 
      marketing strategies, and sharing information.</P>
      <P><FONT color=#006a5a size=+1>Sustainable Agriculture and Agri-food 
      Production</FONT></P>
      <P>When carried out in a sustainable manner, agriculture and agri-food 
      production can be expected to:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>protect the natural resource base and prevent the degradation of 
        soil, water, and air quality; 
        <LI>contribute to the economic and social well being of Canadians; 
        <LI>ensure a safe and high-quality supply of agricultural products; 
        <LI>safeguard the livelihood and well being of agricultural workers and 
        their families. </LI></UL>

            <P>Achieving sustainable development in Canada's agriculture and 
            agri-food sector is a process of continuous improvement as we work 
            toward the integration of economic, social, and environmental 
            concerns. This strategy emphasizes environmental sustainability with 
            the goal of better integrating it into existing ways of doing 
            business. Future strategies will work to more fully integrate all 
            three elements.</P>

      into the way decisions are made and business is conducted in Canada &shy;
