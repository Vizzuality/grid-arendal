            <H4 align=center>The largest-ever ozone hole, roughly three times 
            the size of the U.S., was detected on September 6 by NASA's Total 
            Ozone Mapping Spectrometer.</H4>

            <P>A NASA spectrometer has detected an Antarctic ozone "hole" (what 
            scientists call an "ozone depletion area") that is three times 
            larger than the entire land mass of the United States - the largest 
            such area ever observed.<BR><BR>The "hole" expanded to a record size 
            of approximately 11 million square miles (28.3 million square 
            kilometers) on Sept. 3, 2000. The previous record was approximately 
            10.5 million square miles (27.2 million square km) on Sept. 19, 
            1998.<BR><BR>The ozone hole's size currently has stabilized, but the 
            low levels in its interior continue to fall. The lowest readings in 
            the ozone hole are typically observed in late September or early 
            October each year.<BR><BR>"These observations reinforce concerns 
            about the frailty of Earth's ozone layer. Although production of 
            ozone-destroying gases has been curtailed under international 
            agreements, concentrations of the gases in the stratosphere are only 
            now reaching their peak. Due to their long persistence in the 
            atmosphere, it will be many decades before the ozone hole is no 
            longer an annual occurrence," said Dr. Michael J. Kurylo, manager of 
            the Upper Atmosphere Research Program, NASA Headquarters, 
            Washington, DC.<BR><BR>Ozone molecules, made up of three atoms of 
            oxygen, comprise a thin layer of the atmosphere that absorbs harmful 
            ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Most atmospheric ozone is found 
            between approximately six miles (9.5 km) and 18 miles (29 km) above 
            the Earth's surface.<BR><BR>Scientists continuing to investigate 
            this enormous hole are somewhat surprised by its size. The reasons 
            behind the dimensions involve both early-spring conditions, and an 
            extremely intense Antarctic vortex. The Antarctic vortex is an 
            upper-altitude stratospheric air current that sweeps around the 
            Antarctic continent, confining the Antarctic ozone 
            hole.<BR><BR>"Variations in the size of the ozone hole and of ozone 
            depletion accompanying it from one year to the next are not 
            unexpected," said Dr. Jack Kaye, Office of Earth Sciences Research 
            Director, NASA Headquarters. "At this point we can only wait to see 
            how the ozone hole will evolve in the coming few months and see how 
            the year's hole compares in all respects to those of previous 
            years."<BR><BR>"Discoveries like these demonstrate the value of our 
            long-term commitment to providing key observations to the scientific 
            community," said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, Associate Administrator for 
            NASA's Office of Earth Sciences at Headquarters. "We will soon 
            launch QuickTOMS and Aura, two spacecraft that will continue to 
            gather these important data."<BR><BR>The measurements released today 
            were obtained using the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) 
            instrument aboard NASA's Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite. NASA 
            instruments have been measuring Antarctic ozone levels since the 
            early 1970s. Since the discovery of the ozone "hole" in 1985, TOMS 
            has been a key instrument for monitoring ozone levels over the 
            Earth.<BR><BR>TOMS ozone data and pictures are available on the 
            Internet at: </P>

            <P>TOMS-EP and other ozone-measurement programs are important parts 
            of a global environmental effort of NASA's Earth Science enterprise, 
            a long-term research program designed to study Earth's land, oceans, 
            atmosphere, ice and life as a total integrated
