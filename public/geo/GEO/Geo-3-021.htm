      <P align=justify>Inadequate drinking water and sanitation, indoor air 
      pollution, and accidents, injuries and poisonings: these are just three of 
      the causes of the approximately 3 million deaths suffered annually by 
      children under age five due to environmental hazards.</P>
      <P align=justify>1.3 million children under five in developing countries 
      died from diarrhoeal diseases caused by unsafe water supply, sanitation 
      and hygiene in the year 2000. According to WHO’s publication "Health and 
      Environment in Sustainable Development – Five Years after the Earth 
      Summit" 60% of the 2.2 million deaths a year in children under five caused 
      by acute respiratory infections are associated with indoor air pollution 
      (e.g., from the burning of biomass fuels in small, confined spaces), the 
      lack of adequate heating and/or other unsanitary living conditions. 
      Accidental injuries – including road traffic accidents, drowning, burns 
      and poisonings - are the cause of over 400 000 deaths per year in children 
      under five.</P>
      <P align=justify>The lost or compromised ability to be active which 
      children suffer from environmental degradation is vast. Yet, until 
      recently, no specific efforts had been made to address the environmental 
      hazards which specifically affect children. Children are not "little 
      adults": they are in a dynamic process of growth and development, and they 
      are particularly vulnerable to the acute and chronic effects of pollutants 
      in their environments.</P>
      <P align=justify>For this reason, WHO created the Task Force for the 
      Protection of Children’s Environmental Health and is today launching the 
      first major event to address this issue: the International Conference on 
      Environmental Threats to the Health of Children, in Bangkok, Thailand. The 
      Conference is being opened by Professor Dr Her Royal Highness Princess 
      Chulabhorn Mahidol of Thailand and will run until 7 March. Over 300 
      participants from around the world are expected.</P>
      <P align=justify>Research suggests that over 40% of the global burden of 
      disease due to environmental risk factors may fall on children under five, 
      even though they constitute about 10% of the world's population. The 
      Bangkok Conference will focus on the main environmental threats to 
      children’s health and development, and on a range of measures to reduce 
      environmental impacts on children. In addition to the risk factors 
      outlined above, topics such as children’s exposure to lead, mercury, 
      pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and other chemicals will be 
      discussed. The effects of environmental tobacco smoke, radiation, climate 
      change, and food quality and safety on children will also be 
discussed.</P>
      <P align=justify>Special emphasis will be given to environmental problems 
      in the Asia-Pacific countries. In Bangladesh and India, for example, 
      arsenic in drinking water is a persistent problem. In some countries, 
      concern exists about exposure to lead (that may cause anaemia and nervous 
      system disorders in under-fives, and has been found to be correlated to 
      subnormal IQ) and by exposure to waste sites. In China alone, an estimated 
      2.7 million people may suffer from skeletal fluorosis, an irreversible 
      crippling condition that is caused by the consumption of fluoride-rich 
      drinking water. WHO plans on launching pilot projects to help countries 
      assess and improve children’s environmental health in the near future.</P>
      <P align=justify>The Bangkok Conference also plans to examine ways in 
      which the environment in places besides the home – above all schools, but 
      also workplaces – can be made safer for children. Schools are of 
      particular significance, as a healthy and secure school environment can 
      help protect children from health hazards, abuse and exclusion and can 
      foster learning.</P>
      <P align=justify>"A commitment to child health means that hazards should 
      be reduced in all places where children spend significant parts of their 
      day, including the roads and forms of transport they use to get to and 
      from these places." said Dr Richard Helmer, Director of WHO’s Department 
      responsible for Environmental Health.</FONT></P>
