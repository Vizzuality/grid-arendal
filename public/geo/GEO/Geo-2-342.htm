<H2>Time to save the Aral Sea?</H2><B>The destruction of this Central Asian lake 
is a textbook example of unsustainable development</B> 
<HR>
<IMG align=left border=1 height=240 hspace=6 src="geo-2-342_files/aral.gif" 
vspace=2 width=199><FONT face="times new roman,times,serif" size=3>Up until 
recently, atlases described Central Asia's Aral Sea <I>(at left)</I> as the 
world's fourth largest lake. Fed by two major rivers - the Amu Darya in the 
south, and the Syr Darya in the north - it stretched across an area of 66,000 sq 
km, with a total volume estimated at more than 1,000 cubic km. Its waters 
supplied local fisheries with annual catches of 40,000 tonnes, while the deltas 
of its major tributaries hosted dozens of smaller lakes and biologically rich 
marshes and wetlands covering 550,000 ha. 
<P>How the Aral Sea was turned into an ecological disaster - and might now be 
saved from still further damage, if never fully restored - is documented in a 
recent survey by AG's Land and Water Development Division (AGL) of irrigation 
development in 15 countries of the former Soviet Union. 
<P>In the 1960s, planners assigned Central Asia the role of supplier of raw 
materials, notably cotton. Given the region's arid climate, irrigation was 
imperative, and the Aral Sea and its tributaries seemed a limitless source of 
water. Irrigation development in the Soviet part of the Aral Sea basin was 
spectacular, expanding from an area of about 4.5 million ha in 1960 to almost 7 
million ha in 1980. Local population also grew rapidly, from 14 million to about 
27 million in the same period, while total water withdrawal almost doubled to 
120 cubic km, more than 90% of it for agriculture. 
<P>The result was what water resource experts call "disruption of the prevailing 
water balance" in the Aral basin. Many minor tributaries were so overexploited 
that they ceased to contribute directly to the flow of the Amu Darya and Syr 
Darya. Low irrigation efficiencies - caused by unlined canals and a poor 
drainage network - led to major waterlogging and salinization that eventually 
affected about 40% of irrigated land. Overuse of pesticides and fertilizer 
polluted surface- and groundwater, while the delta ecosystems have simply 
perished: by 1990, more than 95% of the marshes and wetlands had given way to 
sand deserts, and more than 50 delta lakes, covering 60 000 ha, had dried up.

Sea, too, is drying up, its level having dropped from 53m above sea level to 
36m, its surface area shrinking by a half and its volume by three-quarters. 
Today, the sea survives in three sections: the Small or Northern Sea in 
Kazakhstan, the Central Sea, and the Western Sea, mostly located in Uzbekistan. 
The mineral content of the water has increased fourfold to 40 g/litre, 
preventing the survival of most of the sea's fish and wild life. All commercial 
fishing ended in 1982, current fish hauls are negligible, and entire fishing 
communities are now unemployed. Former seashore villages and towns are 70 km 
away from the present shoreline. The exposed seabed consists of vast salt 
tracts, whose sand and dust, polluted with pesticides, are carried by the wind 
up to a distance of 250 km at an estimated rate of 15 to 75 million tonnes a 
year. 
<P>The AGL study says that, with the reduction of the Aral Sea's size, the 
surrounding climate has changed, becoming more continental with shorter, hotter, 
rainless summers and longer, colder, snowless winters. The growing season has 
been reduced to an average of 170 days a year, while dust storms rage on more 
than 90 days annually. 
<P>Communities face appalling health problems. In Karakalpakstan, drinking water 
is saline and polluted, with a high content of metals - such as strontium, zinc 
and manganese - that cause conditions such as anaemia. The last 15 years has 
seen a 3,000% increase in chronic bronchitis and in kidney and liver diseases, 
especially cancer, while arthritic diseases have increased 6,000%. Not 
surprisingly, the infant mortality rate is one of the world's highest. 
<P><B>Regional water strategy</B>. As early as the 1982, the government sought 
to develop a water resources master plan for the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river 
basins and placed strict limits on water withdrawal. Soon after, two basin water 
organizations were created to operate and maintain the main hydraulic 
infrastructures and to monitor water use. With the end of the Soviet period, 
five newly independent Central Asian states established a joint commission for 
water coordination to regulate water distribution in the basin and consolidate 
country positions for the adoption of a regional water strategy. Several 
international organizations and bilateral agencies are supporting the 
preparation of this strategy, as well as regional studies and pilot projects for 
a new approach in water management, and an International Fund for the Aral Sea 
and the Interstate Council for the Aral Sea Problem have been set up to 
coordinate these initiatives regionally. 
<P>But what is being done now to save the Aral Sea, at least from further 
degradation? Among proposals currently under study is transfer of water to the 
Aral from the Caspian Sea. Greater use of agricultural drainage water and 
wastewater, as well as the introduction of more salt-tolerant crops, is 
envisaged and, in part, implemented. About 6 cubic km/year of agricultural 
drainage waters or wastewater are directly re-used for irrigation, while some 37 
cubic km/year return to natural depressions or rivers where they are mixed with 
freshwater and can be re-used for irrigation or other purposes. 
<P>Although these improvements have enabled further irrigation development, they 
are viewed as unsustainable. The five Central Asian republics have decided to 
focus now on demand management, aiming to reduce water withdrawal per hectare by 
raising global irrigation efficiency: this involves canal rehabilitation and 
lining, which reduces losses, and canal regulation for better irrigation 
scheduling. The primary objective remains satisfying crop water requirements 
and, in view of the very limited funds available, measures will be implemented 
gradually and rely mostly on international assistance. 
<P>Several countries have introduced water fees and fines for use of water in 
excess of farm allocation, and turned over to farmers decision making on crops 
to be grown on irrigation schemes. As a result, crops with high water 
requirements - rice in Kazakhstan and cotton in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - 
have been partially replaced by other, less demanding crops. These changes may 
lead to a reduction in water withdrawals, but make planning and monitoring water 
distribution more difficult. 
<P><B>Future prospects</B>. Much progress has been made since 1990. The total 
water withdrawal in the basin has now stabilized at about 110-120 cubic km/year 
(it was about 65 in 1960). However, further improvement is needed to meet 
increasing demand from new water users.

    <TD colSpan=2></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>It has been estimated that at least 73 
cubic km of water would have to be discharged to the Aral Sea each year for a 
period of at least 20 years in order to restore the 1960 level of 53 m above sea 
level. The governments of the riparian countries consider this an "unrealistic 
objective". More feasible options include stabilization of the lake at its 1990 
level (38 m), which would require a total inflow of about 35 cubic km/year. 
However, this would not end environmental degradation and desertification of the 
exposed seabed. Another proposal is to restore the Northern Sea to a level of 
38m to 40 m above sea level, requiring an inflow of at least 6-8 cubic km in 
that part of the Aral Sea for the next five years. 
<P>Promising signs are reported in the Amu Darya delta and Western Sea - since 
1989, a project in Uzbekistan has used the collector-drainage network to bring 
more water to the delta. This water, combined with freshwater, replenishes 
shallow lakes and has allowed re-development of flora and wildlife in the 
abandoned areas, and stopped wind erosion of the formerly exposed seabed. 
Another result of this project has been higher annual fish catches, estimated at 
5,000 tonnes in 1993, up from 2,000 tonnes in 1988. 
<P>Because the water resources of the basin are now more or less stable, or 
decreasing slightly due to climatic change, action is needed to save all 
additional water flowing to the Aral Sea from upstream existing uses. The AGL 
study says a major programme is needed to reduce losses in the rivers and 
canals, mainly by lining and automatization of distribution, to stop irrigation 
expansion, to generalize micro-irrigation and other water saving techniques on 
existing irrigated areas, to redirect drainage water and other spilled reservoir 
and canal water directly to the sea, and to return also the non-consumed 
fraction of the water diverted into irrigation schemes. According to the World 
Bank, the introduction of a water market could also help save more water. 
<P><B>Aral a "sixth state"</B>? Water quality problems increase from upstream to 
downstream due to the increasing salinity and pesticide content of agricultural 
return flow and the poor state of wastewater treatment plants in the basin. The 
defining of water quality standards and their observance may significantly 
affect the quantity of water considered as available for use. The introduction 
of a "polluter" pays tax would then be possible. 
<P>If they were sure that the water would actually go to the Aral Sea, upstream 
countries would be willing to release more water, the study concluded. One 
important measure for the future would be to consider the Aral Sea and the two 
deltas as a "sixth state" with a water allocation from the five Central Asian 
republics. In the round of discussions between the countries, a figure of 20 
cubic km/year in normal wet years has been advanced for this environmental water 
demand, reduced to 12 cubic km/year in the one dry year out of 10. 
<P>All these options and solutions have been studied as part of the regional 
water strategy which, however, involves only the countries of the former Soviet 
Union. At a later stage, Afghanistan - which covers about 12% of the Aral Sea 
basin - would be included in the agreements in order to guarantee sustainable 
water resources management.</FONT>
