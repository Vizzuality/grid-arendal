<H1 align=center>Pacific Fisheries Adjustment and Restructuring Program</B></H1>
<P>In conjunction with the conservation measures announced by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans May 1998, and to address the changes announced in the 1998 
Salmon management plan, the federal government announced a $400 million Pacific 
Fisheries Adjustment and Restructuring (PFAR) Program in June 1998, to be 
invested over a five year period. This program is designed to assist those 
involved in the fishing industry adjust to the changes occurring in the Pacific 
fishery. Selective fishing, economic and species diversification opportunities, 
reductions in the size of the fishing fleet, expanded marketing targeting an 
international audience for anglers, and better public accountability have all 
been part of the first year of the new direction in the Pacific fishery.</P>
<P>To date, the federal government has spent $140.6 million under the PFAR 
program on initiatives such as vessel tie-up, selective fishing, licence 
retirement, tourism and marketing, resource rebuilding, support to individuals, 
economic development opportunities and loans to charter fishing operators and 
lodge owners.</P><B>
<H3>Restructuring the Fishery</B></H3><I>
<P>Selective Fisheries</I></P>
<P>Selective fishing is a fundamental change to the Pacific salmon fishery that 
allows the commercial, recreational and Aboriginal sectors to continue to 
harvest more abundant stocks, while protecting weaker stocks. Financial support 
for the development and testing of new technologies or modifications to existing 
gear is being provided over a transition period of three years. Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada's funding for selective fisheries projects in 1998 totalled $7.3 
million. </P>
<P>In 1998, 40 experimental projects were carried out, including experiments 
with gear modification and methodology, testing of new fishing technologies and 
projects to improve the selectivity of food, social and ceremonial fisheries for 
Aboriginal groups. </P>
<P>A discussion paper on "Selective Fishing in Canada's Pacific Fisheries" was 
released on May 17, 1999, and pilot projects for 1999 will be announced 
soon.</P>
<P><I>Licence Retirement</I></P>
<P>The voluntary commercial salmon licence retirement program is designed to 
meet conservation objectives through a substantial reduction in the number of 
licensed salmon vessels in the commercial fleet. Since 1998, the federal 
government has spent a total of $106.9 million to retire 746 licences. </P>
<P>The retirement of commercial licences from both rounds of the program 
represents a balanced reduction and has contributed to a reduced fleet size of 
2,557 salmon licences. A third round of voluntary commercial salmon licence 
retirement will be held in 1999. </P><I>
<P>Vessel tie-up</I></P>
<P>Commercial salmon licence fees were suspended for 1998, and payments for 
pre-season costs incurred were made to vessel owners who chose not to fish in 
1998. This voluntary vessel tie-up program was offered to vessel owners who 
chose not to fish, but incurred pre-season costs preparing for the 1998 fishery. 
A total of $9 million was spent on the vessel tie-up program. </P><I>
<P>Diversification </I></P>
<P>The federal government is providing funds to support diversification efforts 
through the development of commercial fisheries for under-utilized species. This 
encompasses new and experimental fisheries, expansion of existing but 
under-utilized fisheries, expansion of aquaculture to other species, and 
encouraging value-added in existing fisheries. Work is currently underway on 5 
pilot fisheries: Neon Flying Squid, Pilchards, Mackerel, California Mussels and 
Deep-water Tanner Crab. </P><B>
<H3>Community Economic Development and Adjustment for Individuals</B></H3><I>
<P>Adjustment</I></P>
<P>In addition to $250 million spent annually by Human Resources Development 
Canada (HRDC) in British Columbia, new funding of $30 million has been made 
available over a five year period to assist Aboriginal, commercial and 
recreational participants in the fishery. This funding will assist British 
Columbians to prepare for employment outside the fishery, to supplement or 
replace fishing employment with alternative work, to develop small business 
proposals, or to explore other adjustment possibilities. </P>
<P>HRDC programs are being delivered at the local community level, including: 
<UL>
  <LI>Targeted Wage Subsidies 
  <LI>Self-Employment Assistance 
  <LI>Job Creation Partnerships 
  <LI>Purchase of Training 
  <LI>Local Labour Market Partnerships 
  <LI>Employment Assistance Services 
  <LI>All the above programs are also available to those individuals that may 
  not qualify for EI. </LI></UL><I>
<P>Economic Development </I></P>
<P>Western Economic Diversification (WD) has provided an $18 million Community 
Economic Adjustment Initiative (CEAI) to encourage economic development and 
diversification in British Columbia communities through its partners, the 
Community Futures Development Corporations (CFDCs). </P>
<P>The first applications for funding under the CEAI will be reviewed by the 
Project Steering Committee at a meeting on June 18, 1999. The final deadline for 
project applications under the CEAI is March 31, 2001. </P>
<P>WD is also delivering a $7 million Recreational Fishery Loan Program. This 
program offers assistance to owners of fishing lodges and charter boat 
operations by providing access to credit for the development of business 
strategies on diversification and selective fishing. </P><I>
<P>Tourism Promotion </I></P>
<P>In June 1998, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada announced $2 
million in federal funding to promote British Columbia as a destination for 
recreational fishermen. </P>
<P>Fisheries and Oceans Canada is working with the Canadian Tourism Commission, 
the Sport Fishing Institute and Tourism BC on a tourism and marketing campaign 
aimed at encouraging recreational fishermen to come to British Columbia. </P><B>
<H3>Rebuilding the Resource </B></H3>
<P>The main elements of the Resource Rebuilding component of the $400 million 
PFAR program are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Foster community-based watershed stewardship by establishing stewardship 
  coordinators and habitat auxiliaries to assist community groups, industry, 
  local government and volunteers to effectively protect habitat; 
  <LI>Repair damaged habitat and rebuild weak salmon stocks by extending the 
  Habitat Restoration and Salmon Enhancement Program; 
  <LI>Establish a long-term funding mechanism for habitat restoration; 
  <LI>Rebuild threatened salmon stocks, such as coho, through strategic 
  enhancement; </LI></UL><I>
<P>HRSEP</I></P>
<P>The federal government is providing $7 million this year (1999-2000) to a 
range of community projects designed to conserve salmon and their habitat in 
B.C. and the Yukon. Many of the projects aim to improve weak coho salmon 
stocks.</P>
<P>Recipients of the funding include community, fishing and First Nations groups 
who are working in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. More than 100 
projects are receiving funding this fiscal year through the Habitat Restoration 
and Salmon Enhancement Program (HRSEP).</P>
<P>The projects are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Restoring fish habitat in local streams, rivers and estuaries, to improve 
  salmon survival. This includes building side-channels, stabilizing stream 
  banks, improving water flows, planting riparian vegetation and adding spawning 
  gravel. </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Improving watershed stewardship to lead to sustainable salmon populations. 
  This includes stream inventories, habitat mapping, adult and juvenile fish 
  monitoring and protecting habitat through watershed planning. </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Rebuilding salmon stocks through short-term enhancement projects that help 
  bolster weak populations and complement habitat restoration and fisheries 
  management. Possible activities are incubation and rearing programs and the 
  marking of juvenile fish to assess survival. </LI></UL>
<P>Additional funding of $3 million was provided by PFAR to HRSEP projects in 
1998/99.</P><I>
<P>Community Stewardship</I></P>
<P>Fifteen individuals are being hired to help communities protect fish habitat 
and improve watershed stewardship in pilot areas throughout B.C. and the Yukon. 
The positions will be based in Victoria, Campbell River, Prince George, Salmon 
Arm, Queen Charlotte City, Port Alberni, Abbotsford, Williams Lake, Maple Ridge, 
Smithers, Whitehorse and Gold River. About $1 million is being spent on these 15 
positions.</P>
<P>The individuals will be part of a network of habitat auxiliaries and 
stewardship coordinators that Fisheries and Oceans Canada is developing. A total 
of 15 habitat auxiliaries and stewardship coordinators are being hired in 12 
areas. They will assist community and stewardship groups, industry, First 
Nations and government agencies to more effectively prevent habitat damage. 
These positions will help advocate for fish and fish habitat, participate in 
watershed planning and promote sustainable use of land and water resources. </P>
<P>Additional positions will be filled over the course of this year. Stewardship 
coordinators and habitat auxiliaries will augment and complement the 
Department's existing habitat program, including the work of community advisors 
- who support enhancement and stewardship groups - and habitat field 
staff.</P><I>
<P>Strategic Enhancement</I></P>
<P>A further $1 million in 1998/99 went to efforts to address serious 
conservation concerns for coho stocks using salmon hatcheries and enhancement. 
Partners included the local First Nations. In the Upper Skeena watershed, wild 
coho stocks from the Upper Bulkley and Babine rivers and Toboggan Creek 
continued to be supported and rebuilt through enhancement. New enhancement work 
was begun on the Morice River.</P>
<P>On the Thompson River, existing enhancement continued on coho stocks for the 
Salmon, Coldwater, Spius, Deadman, Louis, Lemieux and Dunn river systems. New 
enhancement work began in the Eagle, Duteau and Middle Shuswap systems. </P>
<H3><B>Community Information Delivery Program </B></H3>
<P>Fisheries and Oceans Canada and its federal partners are holding a series of 
ongoing open houses and public information sessions throughout British Columbia. 
These session provide information to the public on current programs being 
offered by the Government of Canada under the $400 million Pacific Fisheries 
Adjustment and Restructuring Program.</P>
