<P><FONT size=+2>Abstract</FONT>
<P>This study addresses the question: "What has been the role of major U.S. 
foundations in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21 and in financing key 
sustainable development projects in the United States and around the world?"</I>
<P>
<P>The study is cast within a five-year time frame to coincide with a global 
assessment of achievements since the historic Earth Summit held at Rio in 1992. 
It is set against the background of major trends and developments in the 
post-Rio world particularly as they affect natural resource systems and/or 
undermine the world's development of its human capital. 
<P>
<P>In determining the efficacy of foundation giving programs in addressing the 
sustainable development agenda, this study reviews major implementation efforts 
by intergovernmental organizations, national governments, the business 
community, and non-governmental organizations, to not only gauge the scope of 
the implementation process and the momentum that has been generated and 
maintained since Rio, but also the major constraints and challenges to effective 
implementation. 
<P>
<P>The study examines considerable data on foundation giving, its scope, 
consistency, shifts, and emphasis, and the way it has addressed issues of 
sustainable development. A number of key findings resulted and a set of 
indicators were produced and applied to select giving programs to determine the 
kind of impact foundations have had and could have on the implementation 
process. Finally, the study proposes a set of recommendations with a view to 
placing foundations in a more strategic position to exploit the potentialities 
and influence more profoundly the forces that shape the future and exert 
leadership on our transition to sustainable development. 
<P>The study supports the fact that although philanthropy dollars are small when 
compared to those of government and business, "when these dollars have been 
targeted independently and creatively, the leadership value has been 
tremendous."1 
<P><FONT size=+2>I. Introduction</FONT>
<P>The central objective of the Earth Summit, the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio in 1992, was to move the joint 
environment and development issues into the center of economic policy and 
decision-making and to lay the foundation for the transition to a sustainable 
way of life on our planet. 
<P>To this end, UNCED, the largest international conference ever held, adopted a 
series of concrete measures, including two historic documents: a declaration</I> 
of basic principles for the conduct of nations and peoples to ensure the future 
viability and integrity of the Earth as a hospitable home for humans and other 
forms of life; and Agenda 21</I>, a plan of action establishing the agreed work 
program of the international community for the period beyond 1992 and into the 
21st century in respect of the issues addressed by the Conference.2
<P>Although Agenda 21 was adopted by consensus, there was no real consensus on 
the critical question of implementation and the financial arrangements through 
which this was to be effected. The proposed budget of $625 billion - never 
intended to be definitive - proved to be elusive and $125 billion of that sum, 
to be provided largely by increases in Official Development Assistance (ODA), 
remains as yet an unfulfilled expectation with equally diminishing prospects. In 
any event, the developing countries remain firm in their insistence that "new 
and additional" financial resources be provided by the developed countries who 
are largely responsible for the degradation of the planet and who should bear 
the main responsibility for its restoration and rehabilitation, and lead the 
process of sustainability. 
<P>As the United Nations prepares for the fifth anniversary of UNCED, the 
question of financing, especially in the light of declining levels of ODA during 
this period, is likely to dominate the discussions with the need for new and 
additional resources assuming a new urgency.
<P>It could provide new opportunities for serious exploration of new and 
creative ways of financing sustainable development. It is here that the 
non-profit and philanthropic sector, with their long-standing experience in 
"giving" and supporting a wide variety of human and environmental concerns, 
could assume a new leadership, the more so as the citizens' sector begins to 
take on ever-widening responsibilities for action at the grassroots level in 
addressing environmental problems where the impacts are the most real and most 
immediately felt.
<P>If the present implementation and financial dilemmas are to be resolved, then 
other resource bases will have to be tapped and new partnerships with the 
strategically relevant sectors forged. This would be very much in keeping with 
the spirit of Rio whose essential characteristic was "partnership and 
cooperation". Agenda 21 was essentially a framework for new and unprecedented 
levels of global cooperation. Moreover, it was quite explicit in calling for a 
fuller engagement of major groups including youth, indigenous peoples, municipal 
leaders, and business and industry, among others in the sustainable development 
revolution. Any serious assessment of the implementation process, therefore, 
must examine the state of such cooperation. Foundations have a long-standing and 
demonstrated record of support for sustainable development and hopefully, the 
forthcoming global assessment will not only acknowledge and encourage such 
support but also establish the necessary mechanisms for new and creative 
partnerships with the philanthropic community. This study will examine such a 
prospect and make recommendations accordingly.
<P>
<P><B>The terms of reference are:</B>
<P>I. Define and develop a set of indicators to evaluate the response of the 
U.S. philanthropic sector to the UNCED meeting in general and Agenda 21 in 
particular. 
<P>II. Measure the impact (in terms of character and quality) of initiatives 
taken by U.S. foundations to the provisions of Agenda 21 with particular 
reference to the following sectors namely; biodiversity, climate change, energy, 
human capital, as well as the implications of changes in overseas development 
assistance.
<P>III. Suggest options, challenges, constraints, and strategies for improving 
effectiveness of the initiative of the U.S. foundations in relation to the UNCED 
mandate.
<P>
<P>II. The Post-Rio World
<P><B>A. Trends and Pressures</B> 
<P>Since the end of the Cold War, and particularly in the five years since Rio, 
the world's economy has grown explosively. We have seen growth in the standard 
of living, incomes and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a majority of the world's 
developing countries. The world's gross output of goods and services is expected 
to grow by about 2.5 percent in 1996 for a third year in a row. Global trade has 
expanded dramatically; the value of world exports has increased by an average of 
10.5 per cent annually. The net value of worldwide global trade was $4.3 
trillion in 1995. Growth in global GDP in developing countries grew by 5.3 per 
cent per year between 1992 - 1996, up from 3.1 per cent in the 1980s thereby 
outperforming the developed countries. 
<P>Many factors have contributed to this dramatic growth in the world's economy, 
including the globalization and liberalization of trade, as well as the 
explosive growth in communications and information technologies. These advances 
in the movement of people, goods, images and ideas, as well as the deregulation 
of international trade barriers, have lead to the unprecedented growth in trade 
and global economic activity. 
<P>But while these economic trends have been good for many of the world's 
people, the benefits have yet to reach many more or to be shared equitably. 
Nearly 1.5 billion people, especially in "least-developed" countries, 
experienced declining or stagnant per capita incomes and GDP throughout the 
1990s. 
<P>Also, this expansion has caused various social and ecological externalities 
which threaten ongoing improvements in the standard of living worldwide. The 
world is steadily urbanizing; people are abandoning rural areas and flooding 
into cities. While nearly half of the world's population now lives in cities, a 
majority of the world's population -- over five billion people -- are expected 
to make this move by 2015. 
<P>Growing energy demands have characterized this economic expansion. By 1993, 
world energy consumption was almost 50 per cent greater than in 1973. Most of 
this demand was satisfied by the burning of fossil fuels, posing serious risks 
of global climate change, acute local and regional air pollution, and disruption 
of communities and agriculture. Transport is the fastest growing end-use of 
energy in developing countries. In 1995, more new cars were sold in developing 
Asia than in Western Europe and North America combined.
<P>Improvements in agricultural technologies since the onset of the Green 
Revolution have brought increased global harvests, food surpluses in 
industrialized countries, and falling prices, as well as a sense that the 
world's ability to feed itself was inexhaustible. More recently however, a 
number of factors have arisen to raise doubts about food security into the next 
century. The growth rate in world food harvests has slowed markedly, marine fish 
stocks are depleting, soil erosion has accelerated, and population growth 
remains steady. The 1995 world grain harvests dropped 4 per cent from 1994 and 
soybean harvests fell 8 per cent. At the same time, meat production grew 4 per 
cent and the worldwide fish catch climbed 5.8 per cent between 1993 and 1994. 
While globally there is still abundant food, nearly 840 million people remain 
hungry worldwide. Solutions to the threats the world's food supply faces are in 
addressing the environmental and social consequences of intensified farming 
techniques, including land degradation, water pollution, pesticide use, and more 
rational dietary and consumption patterns.
<P>Water presents an equally problematic picture and the most likely leading 
constraint on development in many countries.3
<P>These are but a few of the more manifest social, economic and environmental 
problems that the world increasingly will be obliged to confront as we move into 
a new and perhaps unprecedented era of global economic expansion. These problems 
should give new meaning and an added sense of urgency to the provisions of 
Agenda 21 and the principles of sustainability that it offers as well the 
opportunities for more effective participation by key elements of civil society 
in reversing non-sustainable patterns of production, consumption and lifestyles, 
and in shaping the new order. 
<P><B>B. Agenda 21 : The Implementation Process </B>
<P><B>Implementation Initiatives and Strategies</B> 
<P><B>Global Conference Processes</B> 
<P><B>Since 1992, the United Nations has convened a number of global conferences 
designed to set in motion a systematic process for implementing key provisions 
of Agenda 21, strengthen the commitments of governments and civil society, and 
maintain the momentum generated by the UNCED:</B>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Global Conference on Small Island Developing States (Barbados, 1994)</I> 
  which focused on the susceptibility of island states to environmental 
  degradation, their vulnerability and their requirements for sustainability. 
  <LI>The International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 
  1994)</I> formulated programs for expanded education, health care, family 
  planning and economic opportunities, especially for women, in reducing desired 
  family size and thereby reducing population growth. 
  <LI>The World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995)</I> emphasized 
  that eradication of poverty, full employment and social integration are vital 
  to social development. 
  <LI>The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995)</I> noted that many 
  women disproportionately bore the burdens of environmental degradation but 
  remain largely absent from the process of policy formulation and decision- 
  making although their activities are crucial to sustainable development . 
  <LI>UNCTAD IX (Midrand, 1996), </I>while recognizing the potential benefits of 
  globalization and trade liberalization to developing countries, emphasized the 
  risks of marginalization of poorer countries unable to capitalize on new 
  opportunities. 
  <LI>HABITAT II (Istanbul, 1996)</I> gave new meaning to the promise of 
  partnership between governments and civil society and the urgent need to 
  address the importance of human settlements in sustainable development. 
  <LI>Highly Migratory Species and Straddling Fish Stocks (New York, 1996)</I> 
  secured broad agreement on the need to protect species that move in and out of 
  the territorial jurisdictions and exclusive zones of coastal states. 
  <LI>World Food Summit (Rome, 1996)</I> refocused the problem of hunger as a 
  central global concern and the need to ensure both food security and food 
  availability, especially in the coral regions of the world.</LI></UL><B>All of 
these conferences have adopted plans of action in support of Agenda 21 and 
provided new impetus for international cooperation in specific sectors.</B>
<P><B>National and Local Initiatives</B> 
<P>In addition to these international initiatives, the United Nations also 
reports encouraging progress at the national level. It notes for example that 
over 150 countries have established national level commissions or coordinating 
mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development 
and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda 
setting and strategy building. More than 90 per cent of them have been 
established in response to Rio, the majority in developing countries. In some 
countries, the national councils of sustainable development have been more 
political than substantive in nature. 
<P>Progress had also been reported among major groups such as women, indigenous 
peoples, and NGOs that are increasingly beginning to interact directly with 
national governments and international organizations and are promoting effective 
partnerships among members of the wider community in advancing the cause of 
sustainable development. In this connection, indigenous peoples have become 
especially active participants at the intergovernmental level in encouraging the 
implementation of the Convention on Biodiversity and the need to protect genetic 
resources.
<P>But perhaps the most promising developments are occurring at the local and 
municipal levels where local Agenda 21 initiatives are being generated at a 
remarkable rate.
<P>
<P>According to the United Nations, these have been grass roots expressions of 
concern and involvement rather than top-down planning exercises. In many cases 
local authorities have been reluctant to link their efforts to national action 
plans for fear that the agenda will then be imposed on them from above rather 
than flowing from local needs. A wide variety of successful cases have been 
reported in the last four years on these initiatives. It has also been concluded 
that local level strategies and plans have proven far more successful than those 
at the national level in terms of making a direct impact. 
<P>
<P>On the other hand, whereas NGOs are very active in developing and 
implementing actions for sustainable development at the local and national level 
and serving as implementing partners with national governments, bilateral and 
multilateral aid organizations, they do not always receive the necessary 
financial support from national institutions and do not have adequate access to 
international bodies. If their full potential in helping to achieve 
sustainability is to be realized, however, then their role needs to be greatly 
enhanced. 
<P>
<P><B>The Business Community</B> The Earth Summit made a direct appeal to the 
private sector to become effective partners with the United Nations and 
governments in shaping a sustainable future. So far, business leaders across a 
wide spectrum of the industrial sector are beginning to launch initiatives with 
sustainability as their stated objective and "with notable progress in the areas 
of joint industry/government partnerships and the development of innovative 
policy instruments, environmentally efficient technologies and products, and 
broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider 
community."
<P>
<P>In its latest survey on post-Rio developments affecting the business 
community, the United Nations reports that considerations of cost-efficiency and 
effectiveness are encouraging governments to supplement traditional regulatory 
approaches with a broader policy package including economic instruments and 
other strategies based on "partnerships" between the private and public sectors. 
These instruments, which include environmental taxes and charges, environmental 
subsidies, environmental funds, negotiable emissions instruments, environmental 
performance bonds and voluntary agreements, are in use at some level in all 
regions of the globe by both developed and developing country governments.
<P>
<P>Business and industry organizations are responding with the development and 
implementation of an increasing number of voluntary codes of conduct and 
environmental management systems which help firms to meet environmental 
performance standards without the need for detailed regulation.5 
<P>
<P>A number have also moved beyond "end-of-pipe" pollution control to a more 
integrated cleaner production and life-cycle approach aimed at reducing the 
environmental impacts of the goods and services they provide.6
<P>
<P>Small and medium-sized industries are also addressing the problems of 
sustainability with varying degrees of success. But as the United Nations 
suggests, in both developed and developing countries, they are in need of 
support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by 
national and international environmental regulations, standards and voluntary 
codes that are developed by large companies. 
<P>
<P>Impediments, Constraints and Emerging Challenges 
<P>Despite a significant number of gains in the effort to advance the provisions 
of Agenda 21, there are a number of influences which, while indirect, could 
significantly modify - if not nullify - the gains anticipated in the 
implementation process. These include perverse subsidies, institutional 
roadblocks, environment/development linkages, environmental discontinuities, 
concealed costs of inaction, and consumption.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Perverse Subsidies</B> 
<P>Perverse subsidies are those that exert adverse effects of both environmental 
and economic sorts over the long run. The principal sectors in question are 
agriculture, fossil fuels/nuclear energy, water, fisheries and forestry. All in 
all, these perverse subsidies, being funds going into unsustainable development, 
total some $600 billion per year worldwide, hence they exert a significant and 
often distortive impact on the global economy of $26 trillion, as well as 
serving to encourage abuse of environmental resources (Myers, 1997). Subsidies 
for agriculture can foster over-loading of croplands, leading to erosion and 
compaction of topsoil, pollution from synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, 
denitrification of soils, and release of greenhouse gases, among other adverse 
effects. Subsidies for fossil fuels aggravate pollution effects such as acid 
rain, urban smog and global warming. 
<P>
<P>Subsidies for water encourage mis-use and over-use of water supplies that are 
increasingly scarce in many lands. Subsidies for fisheries foster 
over-harvesting, while subsidies for forestry encourage over- logging. Consider 
marine fisheries: in 1994 the fish harvest cost $124 billion and was sold for 
$70 billion, the difference being made up largely by government subsidies which 
thus stimulated over-fishing to meet short-term consumer demand and prompted 
more fishermen to chase after fewer fish. 
<P>
<P>This is not to say that subsidies cannot serve many useful purposes. The key 
question is: which subsidies, of what sorts, of what scope and with what 
impacts, can be viewed as "perverse", i.e. inimical to society's long-term 
interests? Recall that the proposed budget for Agenda 21 was also $600 billion 
per year. Of course, it would make a superb investment to outlay a mere 2.3 
percent of global GNP in order to ensure that development becomes sustainable. 
But for all manner of powerful even if unacceptable reasons, most governments 
have emphatically declined the opportunity. A notable exception is New Zealand 
which has phased out virtually all agricultural subsidies--remarkable in a 
country where agriculture is unusually prominent.
<P>
<P>Clearly this is a question of major import. Yet it has scarcely been 
identified as a salient issue of our times, let alone documented and analysed. 
Fortunately the MacArthur Foundation has recently funded a small scale research 
project to investigate the question, and as such it is a prime example of what 
foundations can supply: investments that are innovative, catalytic and 
facilitating, rather than merely supportive and reinforcing. As such, they offer 
much scope for policy leverage and multiplier effects.
<P>
<P><B>Institutional Roadblocks </B>
<P>Institutional roadblocks are profound and pervasive in many sectors of 
government. This applies especially to environmental concerns, stemming as they 
often do from lack of integration -- whether economic, political or 
otherwise--among our principal institutions of government (plus other forms of 
governance, notably corporations). In essence, we are blighted by a historic 
division of government into rigidly defined sectors, a division that is 
antithetical to the kinds of changes required to integrate environment into 
policy making throughout government systems. 
<P>
<P>To wit: the fiefdoms of e.g. energy, transport, agriculture and industry all 
have their own interests and agendas, which frequently induce them to subvert 
and otherwise oppose each other's activities. 
<P>
<P>Energy policy usually amounts to a fragmented approach to energy supply, 
instead of offering a coherent framework with emphasis on reductions in both 
supply and demand for fossil fuels plus provision of non-polluting and renewable 
fuels. Transport policy encourages the car culture to the detriment of 
alternative forms of transportation. Agriculture policy promotes unsustainable 
forms of farming based on high-energy inputs, plus over-intensive use of 
fertilizers and pesticides. Equally to the point, transportation policy is often 
pursued with indifference to energy policy; agriculture policy with indifference 
to land conservation policy; and both sets with indifference to climate 
constraints. 
<P>
<P>Key question: Why are environmental concerns not better translated into 
public policy in light of their strong intellectual rationale? Who are the main 
movers and shakers, and how can one best influence them? Where are the prime 
pressure points in the nerve ganglia of bureaucracies? We need an in-depth 
assessment of the entire issue of institutional roadblocks in the environmental 
arena: how they arise, why they become entrenched, and what can be done to 
side-step or eliminate them. 
<P>
<P>For illustration, consider two salient types of environmental roadblocks. The 
first lies with lack of integration between government sectors, as per the 
examples cited. In addition, national policies are often formulated with scant 
concern for international repercussions. Of course, it is one thing to formulate 
policy interventions to promote economic/environmental integration, it is 
another thing to establish them as a working reality in governmental systems 
(plus many other systems, from business enterprises to households). What is 
needed is reform of governmental mechanisms so that throughout economic-planning 
activities, environmental values are taken into account both systematically and 
systemically. Various responses have been attempted, such as joint programming 
and integrative planning. 
<P>
<P>A second type of roadblock lies with institutional inertia. Officialdom's 
attitudes and perceptions are deeply entrenched in myriad ways, inducing 
institutional inertia in virtually every sphere of government. This inertia is 
an exceptionally powerful force, and changes will demand an even more powerful 
countervailing force. At Rio, political leaders engaged in rousing rhetoric in 
support of the environment, while studiously avoiding commitments to actual 
action in the form of specific policy measures backed by concrete programmes and 
time targets. As a result, there have been few solid initiatives to stem 
deforestation and species loss in much of the world, to cut back GHG emissions 
everywhere (even to expand energy efficiency anywhere), and to counter wasteful 
and excessive consumption in affluent societies. 
<P>Since Rio, moreover, there has been all too little mention of the 
environmental cause in the councils of power, in the media or in most other 
sectors of the public arena. If the road to Rio was difficult, how much more so 
has been the road from Rio in face of gross indifference and an implicit 
readiness to maintain institutional inertia. The longer we delay with measures 
to counter the inertia that infects the body politic, the more deeply the 
present patterns of departmentalized government will become institutionalized. 
<P>
<P>Fortunately, there can be productive inertia triggered by a turn-around in 
our institutional systems, generating multiple benefits of progressive size and 
inducing a constructive form of momentum. The more a government engages in 
policy measures to promote the environmental cause, the more the benefits will 
become plain, percolating through every sector of government and segment of 
society. When once the change in direction is achieved, traditionalist 
resistance can quickly give way to organic support. 
<P>
<P>This assessment of institutional roadblocks offers scope for U.S. foundations 
to assemble a group of leading policy makers, also political scientists and 
institutional experts, to confront the challenge head on. In other words, to 
gather together a number of individuals with extensive experience of the 
fundamental problem, and to ask for their views on how to resolve it. Or, to 
express it another way, assemble individuals who understand both the flow of 
energy through ecosystems and the flow of influence through corridors of power.
<P>
<P><B>Salient issues to be addressed could include:</B> 
<P>
<P>How to overcome the super-preoccupation of governments with the short term 
("A week in politics is a long time")? Related topic: how to institutionalize 
the rights of future generations?
<P>
<P>How to ensure that government operates as an organic whole, with policies 
that are consistent throughout the entire system? Translation: how to persuade 
individual sectors and departments to coordinate rather than compete? How to 
counter turf rivalries and empire building?
<P>
<P>How to tackle the tendency of governments to react rather than act (the 
squeaking door syndrome of special interest groups and potent lobbyists)? With 
particular reference to environmental issues, shall we need a catastrophe before 
it becomes clear to governments they cannot continue with business as 
usual--even though that option is increasingly foreclosed by force of 
circumstance (becoming ever-more forceful)? 
<P>
<P>How to persuade governments that to do nothing is to do a great deal in a 
fast changing world? And how to educate governments on the new nature of change, 
which often arrives in non-linear form, i.e. in jumps rather than curves? 
<P>
<P>What is the role of public opinion and the media? Who are the main moulders 
of established (or establishment) thinking?
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Environment/Development Linkages </B>
<P>Environment/development linkages--whether linkages between sectors, issues, 
institutions or stakeholders--have become as vital as they are widespread. 
Despite their super significance, however, these linkages tend to be ignored 
because our view of the world is traditionally grounded in a practice of 
splitting it up into "manageable" components. In a world growing ever- more 
interdependent by virtue of proliferant relationships--whether environmental, 
economic, political or social relationships--we can no longer afford the luxury 
of supposing that linkages are an incidental factor that is too complex to be 
reflected ("operationalized") through institutional responses. Yet we still try 
to direct our daily affairs with institutional systems that reflect a bygone and 
far less integrative era. These institutional systems are singularly 
unsystematic in that they disregard what is now a predominant phenomenon of the 
planetary ecosystem and the world order. 
<P>
<P>Bottom-line concern: we will respond to linkages either by responses of 
sufficient scope and character, or by salvage measures in a world impoverished 
by our disregard for linkages. 
<P>
<P>For illustration, consider the question of the oceans. This obviously 
includes sectors such as fisheries, biodiversity, pollution (both sea- and 
land-derived), technology, climate and energy. Less obviously though inevitably 
insofar as "the oceans" extend to coastal zones, the thematic sphere includes 
human settlements (and hence population: 2.5 billion people live within 100 
kilometers of coastlines, also agriculture and industry (both major sources of 
pollution). The sector can even include forestry insofar as deforestation of 
inland watersheds leads to siltation of port facilities. Deforestation also 
leads to a "smothering impact" from soil, silt and other debris washed off 
watersheds onto in-shore fisheries. 
<P>
<P>Yet our analytic response to oceans issues is typically scientific and 
technical for the most part, whereas the economic and political dimensions 
should receive at least as much weight. Equally to the point, the policy 
approach to the oceans is generally specialized and categorized rather than 
integrative and holistic, even though the latter is surely required for an 
entity with a continuum of human activities that recognize no boundaries. Even 
more significant, the institutions deployed to tackle ocean questions usually 
enjoy scant mandate to address questions in systemic as well as systematic 
manner, even though oceans problems tend to be systemic in both scope and scale. 
Among institutions grappling with oceans problems are the International Maritime 
organization, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the U.N. Law of 
the Sea, UNEP's Regional Seas Programme, and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization's Fisheries Department. Yet because they are constitutionally 
little concerned with questions of linkages, these specialized bodies, mostly 
under the United Nations, are inclined to respond in competitive if not 
contradictory fashion--quite the opposite of the collaborative response 
postulated by the phenomenon of linkages. Indeed the entire U.N. system is 
constitutionally mal-adapted to manage linkages. The specialized agencies (FAO, 
WHO, UNESCO, etc.) have been set up to tackle single-sector issues for the most 
part (food, health, science, etc.). Plainly there should be methodical 
collaboration on environment and development between the two agencies 
principally designated, UNEP and UNDP; but equally plainly, there is little. So 
too, UNFPA and UNICEF do not always work in close accord on child welfare. To 
this extent, the U.N. system hardly functions as a system. 
<P>
<P>The Secretary-General and the central secretariat have inadequate authority 
to ensure that the specialized agencies coordinate their activities.
<P>
<P>It is precisely because of this disregard for linkages that many ocean 
problems are increasing in size and number. When land-use planners decide to 
site industries in coastal zones, they unwittingly foster use of the marine 
realm as a costless sewer, whereupon pollution depletes ecosystem health in the 
oceans with adverse impacts on fish stocks and biodiversity generally. When 
fisheries experts develop plans for sustained-yield harvests in 
developing-nation waters, they tend to limit their analyses to scientific and 
technical factors, overlooking the often impoverished status of fisheries' 
communities that fosters over- harvesting. When human-settlement agencies 
encourage the buildup of ever-larger numbers of people in coastal zones, they 
act with indifference to climatologists' warnings of sea-level rise which will 
surely inundate some of the most densely settled areas of Earth's surface. Most 
of these instances of "linkages myopia" apply in developing and developed 
countries alike. The problems arise because planners do not take automatic 
cognizance of the entire gamut of consequences stemming from their activities.
<P>
<P>What can be done to operationalize the question of linkages? How can we 
ensure that environment/development interdependencies in particular become a 
working reality in economic, political and institutional terms? The challenge is 
to modify policy makers' outlook so profoundly that they no longer look upon 
environment and development as two separate arenas of activity, viewing the 
environment as a constraint on development, to be articulated as little more 
than an add-on factor--instead of the built-in dimension that it has 
demonstrably become. This is no longer an option, it is an imperative--a solidly 
entrenched fact of life. Yet despite its detailed documentation on many 
occasions since UNCED, there has been all too little attempt on the part of 
governments and international agencies, let alone business enterprises and other 
parties, to adapt their policy strategies accordingly. This should not be so 
surprising, since the challenge is no less than a seismic shift in the mind-set 
of policy makers, and a fundamental departure in the day-to-day workings of 
governments, agencies and corporations.
<P>
<P>To break the mould, a sound start could be made through the introduction of 
natural resource accounting, entraining a radical revision of the way in which 
governments assess the state of their economies. A related measure would be to 
adjust those pricing policies that send out false messages about sustainable use 
of environmental resources because they do not reflect all costs of production 
(a measure known technically as "full social cost pricing"). Further measures 
could include the Polluter Pays Principle and the Precautionary Principle. These 
measures will require a radical reorientation to shift policy makers' outlook 
from their erstwhile mode of linear thinking, i.e. non-linkages thinking. 
<P>
<P>To further illustrate the scope and character of the challenge, consider the 
pivotal role played by fuelwood in the rural economies of many developing 
countries. Due to fuelwood deficits, rural households divert animal manure and 
crop residues from farm fields to house hearths, causing a decline in soil 
fertility and cropland productivity. 
<P>
<P>In developing Asia and Africa alone, at least 400 million tonnes of dung are 
burned each year; and each tonne means a loss of at least 50 kgs. of potential 
grain grown, or a total of 20 million tonnes of grain per year, being enough to 
feed 100 million people for one year (some analysts calculate the total at twice 
as much). To purchase the grain on world markets could cost $4 billion. In much 
of Ethiopia, between 60 and 90 percent of livestock manure is used as fuel, 
which translates into agricultural output foregone worth $600 million (mid-1980s 
figure), or roughly 30 percent of the country's value added in its entire 
agriculture sector (Pearce and Warford, 1992). In addition, fuelwood shortages 
cause people to spend large amounts of time daily in trekking to find supplies. 
If we allow just 25 U.S. cents per hour as the value of the time opportunity 
costs involved, the aggregate cost in Asia and Africa alone amounts to at least 
$50 billion per year (Myers and Simon, 1994). This figure is equivalent to 
one-third of the collective GNP of the region with the worst fuelwood shortages, 
Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also to be compared with the cost of a comprehensive 
fuelwood-plantation programme, $1 billion per year for ten years--a figure often 
regarded as quite unjustified and unavailable.
<P>
<P>A more localized illustration lies with traffic congestion. In Bangkok, 
traffic jams are so severe that the amount of passengers' time lost on city 
streets, plus the amount of extra gasoline consumed, are reckoned to cost at 
least $1 billion per year. A further $1 billion is lost through medical bills 
and worker absenteeism due to pollution-related ailments, also through 
pollutants' damage to buildings and other infrastructure. In developing-world 
cities generally, more than one billion people are believed to be living in 
conditions so polluted that the air is not fit to breathe. 
<P>These are just two of the more important intersectoral linkages. The numbers 
and significance of these and other salient linkages suggest that collectively 
they can sometimes be as important as the sectors themselves for overall 
processes of development. Yet almost all the sectors cited are handled by 
separate bodies (whether within governments or international agencies), often 
with institutional interests that are far from congruent with each other.
<P>
<P><B>Environmental Discontinuities</B> 
<P>Here we shall look at a strongly emergent challenge for the environmental 
outlook, viz. environmental discontinuities together with the associated issue 
of synergisms. Both will surely become front-rank problems for the environmental 
cause -- a proposition grounded in the notion that the future is not going to be 
a simple extension of the past. We should anticipate that environmental 
discontinuities, or non-linearities, will become a prominent phenomenon 
worldwide, hence they will carry profound repercussions for the environment. 
Many discontinuities are likely to arise from synergistic interactions between 
two or more environmental problems. 
<P>
<P>Both discontinuities and synergisms constitute "surprise" outcomes in the 
sense that their effects diverge from the expected extensions of established 
trends. They have the capacity (1) be to be profoundly disruptive of 
environments, and (2) to catch us unawares by overwhelming our anticipatory and 
preventative capacities. Indeed, the worst environmental problems ahead will 
often be the ones we have scarcely thought of as yet. These two sets of surprise 
phenomena deserve priority attention from environmental scientists. Yet the 
literature has hardly touched on either of them. A library computer check 
reveals few substantive efforts to broach them even in exploratory terms. They 
are largely black holes of research and analysis, even though both promise to 
become ever-more frequent phenomena in light of the expanding niche of humankind 
and its multifarious activities.
<P>
<P>A classic illustration of a discontinuity is when liquid water changes to ice 
or steam. In the present context, environmental discontinuities, sometimes 
designated by ecologists as "jump effects", occur when ecosystems absorb stress 
over long periods without much outward sign of damage, but eventually are pushed 
to the limits of their resilience. They reach a disruption level at which the 
cumulative consequences of stress finally reveal themselves through systemic 
change of critical scale (Costanza and Cornwell, 1992; Faber et al., 1992; 
Schneider and Turner, 1995). A familiar instance is acid rain. Another is the 
deforestation-induced drop-off in rainfall recorded in a dozen areas of the 
humid tropics (Myers, 1988). Still another example is the depletion of the ozone 
layer to the point where "holes" appear, allowing penetration of unusual amounts 
of UV-B radiation to the Earth's surface. 
<P>
<P>Yet another example is the buildup of greenhouse gases, which, after 
accumulating for decades with little effect, seem set to trigger a pronounced 
disruption of climate systems worldwide (Schneider, 1995; Woodwell and 
MacKenzie, 1995). Yet in each of these cases, our most advanced models tend to 
discount, thanks to their very structure, the possibility of discontinuities. 
<P>
<P>To illustrate the scope of potential impacts, human activities can readily 
deplete the environmental underpinnings (soil, water, climate) of agriculture, 
leading to a downturn in the capacity of agriculture to sustain human 
communities at their erstwhile level (Brown et al., 1997; Ehrlich et al., 1995). 
As a result, established farmlands may no longer be able to do their job of 
feeding humankind with its burgeoning numbers. A further factor lies with 
landlessness: in Philippines, Costa Rica and a number of other developing 
countries, it has recently transpired that no more lands remain readily 
available for opening up to agriculture. There has occurred a "break point" in 
conventional patterns of settlement on the part of smallscale farmers. As a 
result, there has ensued a greatly and suddenly increased pressure on forests 
and savannahs among other environmental resources (Jazairy et al., 1992). We can 
expect there will be many steeply stepped-up tendencies for land-hungry peasants 
to encroach onto hitherto little disturbed environments. 
<P>
<P>While we are well aware of the main factors disrupting environmental 
resources, they tend to be studied in isolation from each other. We know much 
less and understand less still about the dynamic interplay between discrete 
factors. Yet synergisms -- literally, the uniting of energies -- are unusually 
significant. For instance, a biota's tolerance of one stress tends to be lower 
when other stresses are at work. A plant that experiences depleted sunlight and 
hence reduced photosynthesis is unduly prone to the adverse effects of cold 
weather, and it thereby suffers much more in the cold than would a plant 
enjoying normal growth and full vigour. A similarly amplified effect operates 
the other way around as well. In certain circumstances, a synergisms-induced 
outcome can be a whole order of magnitude greater than the simple sum of the 
component mechanisms. While ecologists agree that synergisms rank among the most 
important phenomena in nature, most leading textbooks do not even cite the issue 
in their indexes. But when we consider the likely outcome of several factors 
operating together, we can surmise that many of their effects serve to amplify 
one another through mutually reinforcing interactions. Synergisms in the 
biodiversity sphere, for instance, working collectively and with compounding 
impact, will surely lead to an extinction episode of greater scale than usually 
envisaged. They may also cause the episode to be telescoped in time, meaning 
that the full biotic crisis could arrive sooner than anticipated. To the extent 
that we can discern some possible synergistic interactions, the better we shall 
start to understand the potential patterns and processes as grand scale 
environmental problems works themselves out--and the better we shall be able to 
anticipate and even prevent some of them.
<P>
<P>An example of compounded impact consists of likely interactions stemming from 
global warming. There will be a need for wild plant communities to migrate away 
from the equator and toward the poles, which will be difficult enough for the 
many plant communities that will have to attempt their migrations across 
"development deserts" of agriculture, cities and other obstacles of 
human-dominated landscapes. In addition, there will be problems for agriculture 
due to population losses among many crop plant species. The changed temperatures 
and rainfall regimes expected in a greenhouse-affected world will not prove 
appropriate for those many crops that are finely attuned to current climatic 
patterns. 
<P>
<P>There will be a premium on expanding the genetic underpinnings of crops in 
order to increase their resistance to too much or too little rainfall, or new 
diseases and pathogens, among other problems arising from global warming. Yet 
the gene reservoirs of many crop plants are being more rapidly depleted than 
ever due to virtual wipe-out of wild relatives of crop plants (Food and 
Agriculture Organization, 1993). 
<P>
<P>In summary, we can anticipate that it will increasingly be the case for 
several factors to interact with multiplicative impacts, these factors including 
e.g. deforestation, biodepletion, desertification, soil erosion, acid rain, 
freak weather phenomena, global warming, ozone-layer depletion, and immunotoxin 
pollution among other types of environmental disruption. When we consider all 
environmental problems together, there is potentially a multitude of synergistic 
interactions that could generate pronouncedly adverse repercussions. 
<P>
<P>In face of this challenge, let us bear in mind that we have recently 
witnessed some constructive discontinuities of political sort: the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, leading to the end of the Soviet Union, communism and the Cold War; 
and the peace breakthrough in South Africa, plus potential breakthroughs in the 
Middle East, Bosnia and Northern Ireland. We are certainly able to undertake 
policy discontinuities of the most positive sort, provided we can identify the 
critical openings for intervention and leverage. 
<P>
<P>Herein lies an admirable opportunity for U.S. foundations: (a) to mount a 
research effort that will investigate the scope and scale of a phenomenon that 
may well prove to be the single most disruptive meta- factor for environments in 
the world ahead; and (b) to identify the most productive points for policy 
intervention. 
<P><B>Concealed Costs of Inaction </B>
<P>It is generally easy to calculate the costs of a specific action. It is less 
easy, though no less pertinent to calculate the concealed costs of inaction. 
Herewith a few examples with reference to just a single sector, forestry (we 
have already noted the case of fuelwood shortages).
<P>
<P><B>a) Watershed functions</B> - Some 40 percent of developing world farmers 
depend upon regular flow of rivers and streams from forested watersheds to 
irrigate their croplands. In Rwanda, the montane forest of the Volcanoes Part 
(home to one of the last populations of the mountain gorilla) covers only one 
percent of the country, but acts as the sponge that absorbs and metes out about 
10 percent of agricultural water for that severely overpopulated nation. In 
Java, deforestation-deprived siltation of reservoirs, irrigation systems and 
harbours levied damage costs worth $58 million in 1987 (Magrath and Arens, 
1989). The on-site soil conservation benefits of tree cover within India's 
forests are worth between $5 billion and $12 billion per year, or $100-240 per 
hectare, while the nation-wide value of forest services in regulating river 
flows and containing floods are roughly assessed at $72 billion a year 
(Panayotou and Ashton, 1992). Perhaps most pertinent of all: what price for 
watershed services in the year 2025 when a full three billion people in 
developing countries may well be suffering water shortages?
<P>
<P>b) <B>Fisheries</B> - In Bacuit Bay on Palawan island in Philippines, logging 
on steep slopes has increased soil erosion 235 times above that for undisturbed 
forest, with a "silt smother" effect for the Bay's coral reef and its fisheries 
that reduced commercial revenues by almost half in the mid-1980s (Hodgson and 
Dixon, 1988). At the Korup Park in Cameroon, forest-derived protection of 
fisheries (plus food prevention and soil conservation) have a net present value 
of $85 per hectare (ruitenbeek, 1989). Old-growth forests in the Pacific 
Northwest of the North America protect habitats for 112 fish stocks, just the 
salmon industry is worth $1 billion per year (U.S. Forest Service, 1993).
<P>
<P>c) <B>Genetic resources</B> - Asia's rice crop was hit in the early 1970s by 
a "grassy stunt" virus that threatened to devastate 300,000 square kilometers of 
rice fields. Fortunately, a single gene from a wild rice in an Indian forest 
offered resistance against the virus. Then in 1976 another virus, known as 
"ragged stunt" disease, emerged; and again, the most potent source of resistance 
proved to be a wild forest rice. In India alone, the introduction of wild rice 
strains (plus primitive cultivars) has increased yields by $75 million a year 
(Evanson, 1992). Many other crops -- ranging from food crops such as avocado, 
banana, cashew, coconut, grapefruit and lemon to beverages and spices such as 
cacao, cinnamon, coffee, paprika and vanilla, and to industrial crops such as 
oil palm and rubber -- depend for part of their productivity, disease 
resistance, etc., on genetic infusions from wild relatives in tropical forests. 
Just as the exports of these crops are worth well over $20 billion a year (Food 
and Agriculture Organization, 1996). Medicinals from tropical forest plants have 
a commercial value of $25 billion a year and an economic value several times 
larger (Principe, 1996). Potential future drugs awaiting discovery in tropical 
forests could have a theoretical value to society of $147 billion (Mendelsohn 
and Balick, 1995).
<P>
<P><B>Consumption</B> 
<P>The problem triad of environment, population and adverse technology is now 
being joined by consumption. This could prove the least tractable of the four 
interlinked problems, since consumption patterns and expectations are deeply 
entrenched in most societies and cultures. But change will come, whether by 
design or default. Present consumption -- or<BASEFONT><FONT size=+0>
<P><FONT size=+2>The Role of Major U.S. Foundations
<P><FONT size=+0>
<P>Industrialized-world citizens overall generate three-quarters of other wide- 
ranging pollutants, also toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. Much of the same 
applies to depletion of many of the world's non-renewable natural resources 
(Goodwin et al., 1997). Hence the consumption problem lies primarily with 
affluent communities (especially the U.S.), and they bear a responsibility to 
pioneer a path towards sustainable consumption. This is all the more pertinent 
insofar as sizeable communities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, 
also in China, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America, are entering the 
consumption classes. Already, they total 750 million people, or as many as the 
long established consumers of rich nations. In 1995, more new cars were sold in 
developing Asia than in western Europe and North America combined. While poor 
communities certainly need to increase their consumption, they might consider 
less wasteful and polluting forms of consumption than those that characterize 
rich nations.
<P>
<P>With less than five percent of the world's population, the U.S. utilizes 
nearly 30 percent of the Earth's resources (Dower et al, 1996). Of course, there 
is nothing intrinsically wrong with rich nations consuming a large percentage of 
natural resources if those resources remain plentiful and can be recycled, as in 
the case of iron and steel (85 percent of which are consumed by the top 20 
percent of people, who do not thereby limit the consumption of poor nations). 
Indeed, the rich nations' conversion of natural resources into human capital 
often enhances human welfare all round. It is of scant consequence that the 
average American consumes 115 times as much paper as the average Indian, 
provided the American recycles most of the paper (at present, only 41 percent). 
Much more significant is that the average American consumes 227 times as much 
gasoline as the average Indian (Parikh, 1991). The key question is whether 
consumption uses resources or uses them up.
<P>
<P>The main responsibility for consumption problems lies with the rich, who have 
much more opportunity to modify their lifestyles than people struggling to lift 
themselves out of poverty. Not that the poor can ever aspire to matching the 
rich's lifestyles a long as these are based on e.g. artificially cheap fossil 
fuels. Were individuals worldwide to suddenly engage in fossil-fuel consumption 
to match that of Americans (five times the global average), they would inject so 
much carbon dioxide into the global atmosphere, and prompt so much rapid global 
warming, that many human communities and natural biotas would find it all but 
impossible to tolerate such a disruptive change in such a short time (Woodwell, 
1995).
<P>
<P>The fossil-fuel problem is epitomized by cars, which account for almost 20 
percent of all carbon dioxide emissions (25 percent in the US). In 1950, 2.5 
billion people owned 50 million cars, but today, with more than twice as many 
people, there are ten times as many cars. Within another 25 years and with 40 
percent more people, the car population may well double again to top one 
billion. Rich nations, with 13 percent of the world's population, own 81 percent 
of all cars (the U.S., 35 percent), but in 1996 as many new cars were sold in 
developing Asia as in Western Europe and North America combined (Tunali, 1996).
<P>
<P>In sum, exploitation pressures on natural resources are already unsustainable 
in several respects apart from global warming. Humans co-opt at least 40 percent 
of plants' net annual growth on land, leaving 60 percent for millions of other 
species. What when human numbers double and individuals demand still more 
products from plants? We use over half of available freshwater runoff, an amount 
projected to rise to three-quarters by 2025 through population growth alone. The 
number of water-short people today, 55 million, could well soar to three billion 
by 2025. Much of the same prospect -- reflecting fast-growing consumption in 
relation to expanding population and environmentally adverse technology -- 
applies to other strategic resource stocks such as topsoil, forests, grasslands, 
fisheries, biodiversity, climate and the atmosphere (Harvey and Pimentel, 1996). 
True, technology can help relieve environmental pressures, but to date it is far 
from matching the burgeoning scope and scale of the problem.
<P>
<P>There are various policy options to address the consumption problem, certain 
of which could well be promoted by U.S. foundations. The principal goal is to 
move towards "sustainable consumption" definable as the use of goods and 
services to meet basic needs and foster quality of life, while minimizing the 
use of natural resources and reducing waste and pollutants to environmentally 
acceptable levels, and without undermining the rights of future generations 
(Merck Family Fund, 1995; Consumers International, 1995).
<P>
<P>There is a lengthy list of policy options available, which could well be 
promoted by U.S. foundations (among interested bodies to date are the MacArthur 
Foundation, the Merck Family Fund, and the Pew Charitable Trusts). For instance, 
we need to correct marketplace failures so that prices reflect all environmental 
costs. A prime source of externalities is our use of gasoline. If we calculate 
the "true social cost" of burning gasoline by internalizing the more immediate 
externalities such as air pollution (which alone are worth $300 billion), the 
U.S. price would rise by the equivalent of a $2 tax per gallon. If Americans 
were to cover all costs of their car culture, including noise pollution (though 
still omitting global warming), they would pay at least $8 per gallon. The car 
culture would then lose many of its attractions: there are few better educators 
than the wallet. Moreover, the car increasingly fails as a convenience when 
traffic jams cause Americans to lose time worth $80 billion a year.
<P>
<P>A further approach to the externalities question is to examine the 
"ecological footprint", being the foreign resources required to support 
consumption. These include agricultural lands, forests, fisheries, and energy 
supplies, also waste- absorption services. Rich nations' demands for food, 
energy and other resources, plus waste absorption, oblige them to depend 
increasingly upon outside sources. This would be acceptable if trading 
relationships were equitable, i.e. if consumer nations were to pay prices 
reflecting all externalities, including depletion costs. Often, however, rich 
nations compensate for their depletive use of their resource stocks by 
effectively appropriating those of poor and otherwise disadvantaged nations 
(Korten, 1995). In addition, there is often no market for environmental benefits 
such as atmospheric waste-absorption services, hence they cannot be traded 
whether fairly or not; and their general lack of property rights means that they 
are open-access resources. To reiterate, global warming from rich nations' 
consumption of fossil fuels will affect countries and people right around the 
world.
<P>
<P>On average, a rich-nation consumer currently needs four to six hectares of 
productive land (croplands, pastures, forests, etc.) to sustain his or her 
lifestyle, yet the amount of such land worldwide is only 1.7 hectares per 
person. If everyone were to consume in the manner of rich nations today, we 
would require an extra three planets like the Earth (Durning, 1996). To this 
extent, a rich-world person living beyond his or her environmental means may be 
depriving people in poorer nations of the wherewithal to meet their basic needs 
-- people who are often up against the "environmental wall" anyway. An 
American's footprint is 5.1 hectares, an Indian's 0.38 of a hectare (though 
because of India's huge population, its national footprint is 361 million 
hectares whereas its productive land totals only 250 million hectares) 
(Wackernagel and Rees, 1996). An American with an energy-efficient can reduce 
his or her transport footprint by a factor of three, riding the bus by a factor 
of five, and using a bicycle by a factor or twelve. Consuming less meat and more 
fresh food decreases the food footprint by a factor of three (Wackernage and 
Rees, 1996).
<P>
<P>In addition, we can increase resource-use efficiency through fewer materials 
inputs, longer product lifetimes and waste prevention. We could accomplish much 
by utilizing technologies already available. With the right incentives (which 
foundations could expertly identify), there could even be a four-fold increase 
in resource productivity (von Weisacker et al, 1996). Efficiency enables 
sufficiency, which means scant need for belt tightening or hair-shirt 
sacrifices. On the contrary, there is sizeable profit in it. During the past two 
decades, the 3M Corporation has saved $780 million through recycling and waste 
management.
<P>
<P>Similar savings can be gained by reducing excess packaging. Packaging with 
repeat emphasis on brand-name image is costly to consumers and makes little if 
any contribution to human welfare. Add in advertising and other inducements to 
commit customers to ever-greater consumption, and the annual total amounts to 
some $600 billion worldwide (Barnet and Cavanagh, 1994). Moreover, throw- away 
packaging in the US, as in several other industrialized nations, comprises 
nearly half of all municipal solid waste. Tomatoes and green peppers that last a 
week are sold in foam containers and plastic trays that last a century. Seattle 
recycles 42 percent of its solid waste, by contrast with a nation-wide average 
of 17 percent: again, much scope to take up the slack.
<P>
<P>In addition, governments could be persuaded to lead the change towards 
sustainable consumption through their procurement and administrative procedures. 
To cite a simple example: were governments to equip all their buildings with 
long- lasting and low-power light bulbs (as has been done at the White House), 
this would greatly expand the market for these products and enable manufacturers 
to engage in production economies of scale. The same applies, only more 
significantly for purposes both environmental and economic, to high mileage 
vehicles.
<P>
<P>Finally, there is much scope for mobilizing the media to promote sustainable 
consumption. Each day, an average American is the target for 300 messages urging 
him or her to consume more. How about using the media to encourage people to 
consume more discriminatingly and sparingly? The same American spends an 
aggregate of one year watching television -- the main mode for advertising. 
There are now television sets in one billion households comprising almost half 
of humankind, a total that could well double by 2010. Again, this could prove a 
singularly fertile field for foundation research and intervention.
<P>
<P>In the U.S., just the 100 largest corporations pay for 75 percent of 
commercial television time -- making them an admirable limited target for 
foundation activity. These corporations' advertising outlays have multiplied 
nearly seven-fold since 1950, with the growth rate fastest since 1980.
<P>
<P>At the same time, there may well be need to restrain some of advertising's 
practices. How about reducing the sheer volume of advertising, now worth $650 
per American per year and often aiming to promote products that no one seemed to 
want a few years ago but that everyone will shortly "need"? Advertising has gone 
so far to stimulate consumption as an end in itself that it now views it as a 
perpetual mandate. To the extent, moreover, that consumption is increasingly 
pursued as a means to enhance social status rather than to foster personal 
fulfillment, a reduction in advertising, shared by everyone, may prove readily 
acceptable to public opinion.
<P>
<P>Let us bear in mind the ultimate imperative. It is not that consumption 
levels <B>should</B> alter among rich communities, rather they <B>will</B> alter 
if only because the Earth cannot indefinitely support the present consumption 
loading, let alone future loading. the realistic choice is whether present 
consumption is changed through greater efficiency, smarter technologies, more 
equitable sharing, and a start on moderation in consumption -- or whether it 
changes anyway as ecological and social systems are undermined until they fail, 
whereupon people will find themselves obliged to modify their consumption 
behavior, even to "do more with less". The choice will be made by design or by 
default. In many respects, it is already being made, albeit by default for the 
most part. Public opinion polls reveal that more than half of all Americans, and 
an ever greater proportion in several other rich nations, recognize that if 
environmental problems are to be surmounted, "changes in lifestyle" and even 
"reduced consumption" must be accepted as inevitable (Merck Family Fund, 1995; 
Korten, 1995).
<P>
<P>A shift in consumption patterns for the rich will mark one of the greatest 
revolutions in human behaviour. Daunting as is the prospect of generating such a 
revolution in face of long-established inertia, recall that some surprising 
shifts have recently proved feasible: during the 1980s, 55 million Americans 
gave up smoking -- a social earthquake, virtually overnight (For an overall 
assessment of behavior shifts in relation to environment, see Gardner and Stern, 
1996). In any case, a shift in consumption patterns means there will be scope 
for people to engage in the sorts of lifestyles that can ultimately prove more 
rewarding, with emphasis on non-material satisfactions. Should the second car be 
foregone and the savings be spent on personal computers, CDs, photography and 
sports, none of which pollutes much or eats up large amounts of raw materials? 
The basis of certain of these activities, electronics' technology, offers much 
potential for enriched lifestyles and environmentally friendly products. Whereas 
materials account for 40 percent of the value of a car, they make up 0.3 percent 
of the value of a micro-chip -- and all the microchips in the world comprise so 
little volume they would fit inside a jumbo-jet.

<P><FONT size=+2>III. Actions by Major U.S. Foundations to promote Environmental 
and Human Sustainability</FONT> 
<P><B>A. Giving Community, USA</B> 
<P>As was indicated previously, foundation giving is a well established American 
tradition with programs covering almost the entire spectrum of human concern and 
whose value to the United States and the world is assuming increasing 
significance if not urgency. Perhaps Warren Weaver, in his book "U.S. 
Philanthropic Foundations: Their History, Structure, Management and Record" best 
captured the essence of the foundations, their scope of giving, and their 
contributions to society over the years, when he said almost 20 years ago:
<P>"...foundations have freed large parts of the world from the curse of 
diseases such as malaria and yellow fever; have brought enjoyment of the arts to 
millions of people; have created and helped supported universities and research 
institutes; have clarified and otherwise serve the law; have in many practical 
ways promoted international understanding and have encouraged the cause of 
peace; have shown how population can be controlled and people fed; have helped 
developed broadly trained leadership for business and government; have 
significantly aided the emerging nations; have importantly contributed to our 
growing knowledge of physical and living nature; have been alert in aiding new 
fields of activity; have helped to clarify the goals of present-day humanistic 
scholarship; have made possible the development of important new scientific 
instruments for studying the atom, the cell, and the star; have in language and 
area studies, anticipated and provided for some of the pressing needs of our 
country in its new worldwide responsibility; have created multi- million dollar 
free funds for basic research; have recently developed and supported several 
projects to extend the opportunities of higher education to qualified Negroes; 
and have liberated thousands of gifted individuals from the limitations of 
inadequate education, thus freeing them for greater service to society."
<P>This pattern of giving has continued throughout out the years adjusting to 
new circumstances and the imperatives of explosive global change, 
democratization and accelerating environmental degradation. Looked at in terms 
of Agenda 21 and the challenge of environmental sustainability, it might be said 
with confidence that foundation programs have antedated these developments by 
several decades. Although it is tempting to consider the UNCED, which gave rise 
to Agenda 21, as a convenient point of departure, it should not be forgotten 
that the Conference was part of a dynamic continuum of human efforts to come to 
terms with our changing relationship with the natural world, especially as we 
shift progressively from being mere ecosystems creatures to ecosystems shapers, 
a virtual force with nature and a source of dramatic earth change. 
<P>Agenda 21 could thus be said to give added legitimacy and authority to the 
concept of sustainability, making it a central global concern in the closing 
days of the 20th Century. During this process, however, the role of foundations 
can hardly be overestimated in view of their contributions supporting the 
mobilization of scientific energy and expertise to address more fully the state 
of the environment and to enable the non-governmental community to become 
effective participants in the shaping of effective solutions. Sometimes such 
support has resulted in significant scientific breakthroughs, as was the case of 
the Green Revolution. At other times foundation activities have served to keep 
issues in public focus by providing consistent support for such critical 
environmental issues as forestry conservation, biodiversity, as well as rural 
poverty. Moreover, as civil society begins to assert itself and to empower 
citizens to become more effective participants in informed decision making, 
foundation contributions have likewise begun to expand in these areas. 
<P>A clear demonstration of foundation support for Agenda 21 may be found in 
their assistance to non-governmental organizations enabling a number of them to 
become effective participants in the UNCED preparatory process. Not only did the 
NGOs make their presence felt in actively participating in discussions, 
providing new and often fresh perspectives on major issues, they also submitted 
their own documents which often were reflected in the final texts. NGOs were 
also a powerful presence at Rio and their influence on both the Biodiversity and 
Climate Change conventions were both responsible and effective. These examples 
are clearly suggestive of possibilities that are open to foundations given the 
considerable resources over which they preside. Moreover, foundation giving 
continues to grow as their numbers and assets increase.
<P>According to most recent estimates, private contributions from all sources -- 
foundations, individuals, corporations and bequests -- total some $129 billion 
in 1994, representing around 2% of GDP. Preliminary estimates for 1995 place 
this figure at $143.85 billion, an increase of about 9%. In 1994, US foundations 
numbered 38,807 with combined assets of about $195 billion, and gave a total of 
$11.3 billion, a slight increase over 1993. 
<P>The larger foundations are responsible for a substantial portion of total 
grant dollars and account for a considerable share of total assets. They 
therefore hold the potential of being effective leaders in the sustainable 
development revolution, and as such, would seem to warrant closer scrutiny. For 
example, the 50 largest foundations ranked by total grants in 1994 accounted for 
$2.7 billion, or 24% of the $11.3 billion total grants in 1994 (Renz, Qureshi 
&amp; Mandler, 1996). The 50 largest foundations in total assets accounted for 
$70.9 billion, or 36% of total foundation assets of $195 billion in 1994 (Renz, 
Qureshi &amp; Mandler, 1996) .
<P>During this period, their major area of focus appeared to be: education, 
which received the greatest portion of grant dollars, 29.2%; followed by human 
services, 15.4%; and health, 15.2% (Renz, Qureshi &amp; Mandler, 1996). Although 
environment and animals appear to be somewhat on the lower end of giving, 5.1%, 
this level has remained constant during the last 5 years. But perhaps the most 
encouraging feature in this regard is that the major foundations which topped 
the list in total grant dollars in 1994, had programs which directly related to 
Agenda 21. These foundations include Ford Foundation, W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 
Pew Charitable Trusts, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, 
Annenberg Foundation, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Lilly Foundation, Rockefeller 
Foundation, and David and Lucille Packard Foundation.
<P>Recent foundation grants were reviewed particularly in the critical issue 
areas of biodiversity, forests, climate change, energy, human capital 
development, agriculture and oceans. While these have not been definitive, they 
are indicative of how consistently foundations have responded to issues of 
environmental degradation. In a number of instances, although the grants may 
have been small, the results have been exceptionally promising and could serve 
as models for future targeted grants that hold the promise of strong multiplier 
effects. Several examples will be presented where foundation grants have served 
to stimulate action in much broader levels and have produced results which have 
contributed significantly to the implementation of the sustainability 
development agenda. These are the Rockefeller Foundation's Energy Programme, the 
Climate Institute, Smart Wood, and Sustainable Northwest. 
<P><B>B. Select Sectors and the Challenge of Implementation Biodiversity</B> 
<P>The biodiversity issue loomed large at the Rio Earth Summit, to the extent 
that the main outcome was one of the principal products of the entire Earth 
Summit, the Biodiversity Convention. The Convention has now been signed by 167 
governments, indicating that it is a salient concern for the community of 
nations. Despite some action, bio-diversity continues to decline more rapidly 
than ever. This is due primarily to habitat loss through population pressures, 
poverty, and a host of exploitation activities (notably over-logging of the most 
species-rich environments, tropical forests) that are not directly aimed at 
extirpation of wildlife and species (Wilson, 1992).
<P>Biodiversity--or rather, biodepletion--is one environmental problem that is 
intrinsically irreversible. When a species is gone, it is gone for good. In 
terms of our economic welfare, that will often be for bad, as witness the many 
drugs and pharmaceuticals, new and improved foods that depend on wild plants and 
animals (Pearce and Moran, 1994). For instance, plant-based drugs and 
pharmaceuticals were worth $40 billion per year in just the developed world as 
far back as the mid- 1980's, and probably as much in the developing world as 
well; plant-derived anticancer drugs in the U.S. save 30,000 lives per year 
(Principe, 1996). 
<P>Were the present species extinction spasm allowed to persist unchecked, the 
number of people obliged to live in a severely impoverished biosphere for the 
next 5 million years (possibly several times longer before evolution could 
generate replacement species) could be in the order of 500 trillion, or 100 
times more people than have ever existed (Myers, 1995).
<P>
<P>The main mode of safeguarding biodiversity is through protected areas. The 
amount spent by governments domestically on protected areas in 1994 (the latest 
year with data) was $4.1 billion. In addition, $800 million was assigned for 
biodiversity during the period 1994-96 by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) 
for an average of $267 million per year. On top of this, international NGOs 
spent in the order of $1 billion in 1995 (World Wildlife Fund, $290 million). 
The amount estimated for worldwide biodiversity conservation under Agenda 21 for 
the period 1993-2000 is $3.5 billion per year while the Global Biodiversity 
Strategy estimated conservation needs worldwide at $17 billion per year 
(International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources(1996; 
Johnston and Green, 1995). 
<P>Since UNCED, annual ODA funding for biodiversity has been lower than in the 
pre-GEF period of 1987 - 1991. Indeed, non-GEF biodiversity aid during 1987-1994 
was only $446 million, hence massively short of what is needed for conservation 
worldwide (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, 
1997). AID's funding quadrupled during 1989-92, but then dropped for the next 
two years. 
<P><B>Forests</B> 
<P>Closely associated with biodiversity is the forests issue insofar as the 
great bulk of species occur in the world's forests. In fact, at least half and 
possibly a still higher proportion of all species occur in tropical forests 
alone. Fourteen of 18 "hotspots" are located in tropical forests, and measures 
to safeguard these "hotspots" are also measures to safeguard key forest tracts. 
Climate change is also tied in with forests insofar as forests contain 
three-fifths of all carbon on land; at the same time, deforestation is the 
source of perhaps one-fifth of all carbon dioxide emissions into the global 
atmosphere, a proportion that is rising rapidly. All the more regrettable, then, 
is that the Rio Earth Summit could not come up with a Forestry Convention to 
link up with the Biodiversity and Climate Conventions. True, Rio produced a set 
of 15 Forest Principles for the sustainable management of forests as the basis 
for further negotiations on an international forests agreement. These Principles 
have been much discussed in the interim, though without much substantive 
progress. 
<P>There have been two major institutional initiatives since Rio: the World 
Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development, and the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Forests. They are still underway, and it remains to be seen how far 
they will achieve. To-date, however, it seems they will largely be following the 
old- time religion that addresses problems arising <B>within</B> forests, such 
as careless logging, lack of protected areas, and inadequate ecological 
understanding of forests ecosystems. Yet many if not most depletive processes 
arise <B>outside</B> forests in the form of shifted cultivators (displaced 
landless peasants) in the case of tropical forests, and acid rain and global 
warming in the cases of temperate and boreal forests. Hence there is a premium 
on tackling sources rather than symptoms of forest decline. We urgently need to 
gain a closer grasp of the status of forests within economies whether national, 
regional, or global, and of those forces -- economic, political, social, etc.-- 
that often underlie the progressive depletion of forests. It is indicative of 
how far this challenge is overlooked that the conference agenda of the 1997 
triennial meeting of the International Union Forestry Research Organizations 
gives all too little attention to these crucial factors that lie outside the 
realm of traditional forestry.
<P>The challenge also seems to be sidestepped by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Forests (IPF). While prompting governments to set up an International 
Negotiating Committee in February 1997 for a global Forest Convention, the IPF 
is showing itself to be deficient in two respects. 
<P>First, it does not acknowledge the underlying causes of forest depletion in 
whatever part of the world, calling instead for further research on issues that 
are already understood well enough to warrant urgent initiatives. Secondly, it 
does not address the question of why bodies such as FAO, ITTO, UNEP, the World 
Bank and many governments, have not yet got to pragmatic and productive grips 
with forest problems that have been well-known for at least two decades.
<P>In light of the above, it is scarcely surprising that the Forest Principles 
amount to a non-binding and rather vague set of propositions. Worse, they are 
opposed by a good number of leading tropical-forest countries notably India and 
Malaysia -- and the G-77 countries as a whole have argued that if they were to 
accept the Forest Principles entirely, they would effectively sign away part of 
their sovereignty over these natural resource stocks. Although a few action 
initiatives have been agreed, there is no timetable established for them (unlike 
the case of the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions), and they have no 
legal teeth. 
<P><B>Climate Change</B> 
<P>The Rio Earth Summit not only produced the Climate Convention but it 
established the Conference of Parties (COP) as the body responsible for 
implementing the framework convention. The COP goals are to "keep under regular 
review the implementation of the convention" by examining the "obligations of 
the parties, the exchange of information, and the implementation and evolution 
of scientific and technical knowledge". 
<P>The most recent COP meeting (COP-2) was in Geneva in July 1996 with some 140 
countries represented. The meeting was marked by a dramatic shift in the former 
U.S. stance when Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth called for a legally binding 
agreement to reduce post-2000 industrialized-country emissions of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gases, with specific timetables and targets. 
<P>While pressure builds up for action on climate change and especially global 
warming, the divide between various industry groupings is growing wider. The oil 
and coal industry are becoming ever-more resistant to initiatives to reduce 
fossil fuel use, while other industry groupings are looking for stronger climate 
targets, and especially for market-oriented climate policies. At the Geneva 
meeting, the insurance industry became notably vocal. Some 60 insurers signed a 
statement calling on governments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Insurance overall amounts to $1.4 trillion a year worldwide, or five percent of 
the global economy and half as much again as the oil industry. Insurers have 
encountered unprecedented costs in recent years through a steady increase in 
extreme weather phenomena. During 1990-95, the industry paid out $57 billion for 
weather-related losses of the type to be encountered in a greenhouse world 
(floods, droughts, hurricane -- ostensible portents of global warming), compared 
with a total of $14 billion for the entire 1980s. 
<P>The insurers' fears are well-founded. A 3 to 4 degree Centigrade rise in sea 
temperatures as projected by atmospheric models could increase the destructive 
potential of hurricanes by 50 percent. It could also lengthen the hurricane 
season in North America by two months or more, allowing storms to move north as 
far as New York City. Were a hurricane similar to Hurricane Andrew to strike 
Miami or New York, it could cause $50 billion in claims, or nearly one-third of 
the capital base of the American insurance industry. Already, insurance rates in 
Florida have been driven up by one fourth, and reinsurance premiums by four to 
five times, while reinsurers' liability has been capped. The time could soon 
arrive when people in high risk zones could not obtain any insurance at all 
(Flavin and Tunali, 1996). 
<P>Despite the fact that the insurance industry has $160 billion in surplus, 
just two freak weather events could eliminate $80 billion of that surplus, 
leaving the industry in danger of "global collapse", according to Frank Nutter, 
the head of the Reinsurance Association of America. Parallel expressions of 
concern have stemmed from the Gerling international trade. For one thing, it 
magnifies the environmental effects of production by expanding the market for 
commodities beyond national boundaries. More than one-quarter of world 
merchandized trade involves goods derived directly from the natural resource 
base that ultimately underpins all economic activities. This is notably the case 
with primary products such as minerals. Second, it allows countries that have 
depleted their own resource bases (or have passed laws protecting them) to reach 
beyond their borders for products, effectively shifting the environmental 
impacts onto other countries and communities. Third, certain national 
environmental laws and even some international environmental treaties are coming 
to be viewed as "nontariff barriers to trade", threatening efforts to enhance 
environmental quality within countries and to safeguard the global commons. If 
the potential environmental benefits of free trade are to be realized, then 
trading rules such as those developed by GATT must recognize that widespread 
environmental externalities are in effect environmental subsidies. 
<P>This all means that national governments acting alone are unable to control 
the environmental effects of trade, making international cooperation essential. 
As a result, environmental issues are now featuring strongly in ongoing trade 
negotiations such as those of the Uruguay Round, NAFTA, and the European Union's 
Maastricht Treaty. Thus trade can become a prime tool for shaping a world that 
is environmentally sustainable. 
<P>The trade boom has been reinforced by the revolution in 
information/communications technology. Daily trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange frequently exceeds 300 million shares, 200 times the average in the 
1950s. Thanks to electronics, over $1 trillion moves around the world each day 
in search of investment opportunities. This is a sizable segment of the global 
economy's $26 trillion. While many of the funds return next day, the sum offers 
huge scope to affect the environment. this is notably the case when, for 
instance, the stock of a timber corporation is suddenly boosted by an inflow of 
funds, enabling it to purchase another forest holding or concession in Amazonia, 
Borneo or Siberia. Funds of this scale can be exceptionally influential in 
land-use planning and other activities affecting environments in all parts of 
the world. 
<P>There have been proposals to exploit the daily $1 trillion by levying a tax 
of e.g. one percent of turnover. The $100 billion annually garnered from what is 
in effect a single worldwide stock exchange could be utilized for various 
international purposes, including safeguards for global commons such as the 
atmosphere and climate, the oceans, or the planetary spectrum of species (the 
anticipated revenues would be twice as much as all foreign aid). It would also 
help to damp down the more speculative and disruptive forms of currency trading. 

<P><B>Energy</B> 
<P>Closely allied to the climate sector is energy, especially with respect to 
new, renewable and non-polluting sources of energy as alternatives to fossil 
fuels. Many developed-world governments have asserted that they intend in 
principle to counter global warming by limiting year-2000 CO2 emissions to 1990 
levels, but only half of them are likely to meet their targets without 
substantive policy measures to translate principle into practice. At the same 
time, they continue to subsidize fossil fuels ten times more than non-polluting 
energy sources (energy subsidies worldwide, mostly in favour of polluting fossil 
fuels amount to over $200 billion pe year). By contrast, India now allows a full 
tax deduction for renewable energy investments. 
<P>Of the various energy alternatives, a leading candidate is solar energy. 
Recent initiatives in technology development have resulted in dramatic 
improvements in efficiency and costs. But the solar prospect hinges upon 
critical factors of start-up economics. If the high capital costs could be 
temporarily offset by financial mechanisms, it would provide momentum for solar 
energy to become an economically competitive response to CO2 emissions and 
rising energy demands. As it is, the consumer's cost had fallen from more than 
$70 per watt in the 1970 (199 dollars) to $4 per watt today, and it is expected 
to drop further. 
<P>Two billion people in developing countries mostly in rural areas and far from 
a central power supply, lack access to electricity or other modern energy 
sources. Photovoltaics can provide them with services such as lighting, heating 
and refrigeration at cheaper cost than adding power lines. During the past ten 
years, silicon cells that convert sunlight into electricity have been installed 
in or adjacent to 250,000 homes, mostly in remote areas of countries such as 
China, Sri Lanka and Mexico. In Kenya in 1993, more homes were powered with 
solar cells than by extending the national electricity grid. In Brazil, utility 
companies are starting to support solar electrification in Amazonia and other 
areas where it is impractical to extend power lines. In South Africa, the 
government has initiated a major effort to supply millions of rural people with 
solar energy, and in Vietnam, where less than one-fifth of the country's 77 
million people have electricity, the Women's Union has launched a solar 
electrification program (Flavin, 1996). 
<P>As a measure of solar power as a burgeoning energy source, Japan now features 
over 100 million solar-powered consumer electronic devices. In Norway, 50,000 
homes are powered by photovoltaics. In Israel, more than 900,000 solar units 
heat 83 percent of the country's domestic water (Roodman and Lenssen, 1995). In 
Colombia, there are 30,000 solar water heaters. In Jordan, over one quarter of 
households use solar hot-water systems (Flavin, 1996). 
<P>Other non-polluting sources of energy are available, primarily wind, 
geothermal and hydro-power. While none of these enjoys the flexibility, 
adaptability, and portability of solar energy, they all deserve further 
development. Wind power has become the world's fastest growing energy market 
even though it currently provides less than 0.1 percent of the world's 
electricity. There were 23,000 turbines operating by late 1995, and output 
expanded from 2000 MW in 1990 to 4500 MW in 1996. The cost has fallen by more 
than two-thirds during the past ten years and is expected to drop to only four 
cents per kilowatt hour, making it the least expensive power source to date 
which can be developed on a large scale worldwide. In many regions, the cost is 
no lower than that for energy from new coal plants. India is the first 
developing country with a significant market for wind power, and it is second to 
Germany in the number of annual installations. Germany's wind power now exceeds 
1000 MW, making it the world's most vigorous wind power market. India possesses 
the second fastest wind-power industry with 500 MW installed, while China plans 
on 1300 MW by the year 2000. In California, there were 1700 turbines generating 
enough electricity to supply all of San Francisco's residents (Flavin, 1996). 
<P>This account of energy alternatives offers much opportunity for foundations 
to spur the development of solar and wind power among other renewables. In 
addition, there is still extensive scope to meet energy needs through efficiency 
and conservation. Aggressive public education and advertising, promoted in part 
by foundations, could encourage people to reduce wasteful consumption of energy. 
There are lots of examples of the exceptional savings available. According to 
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, a new bank 
headquarters in Amsterdam uses 90 percent less energy per square meter than its 
predecessor. It costs an extra $0.7 million to build but saves $2.4 million a 
year. Climate-sensitive design of buildings in the United States, using 
available technologies, could cut heating and cooling energy use in residential 
buildings by up to 70 percent, and total energy use in commercial buildings by 
60 percent. Simply planting trees around some buildings can provide enough shade 
to cut cooling needs by as much as 30 percent (Roodman and Lenssen, 1995). 
<P><B>Human Capital Development</B> 
<P>Principle 1 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development was 
emphatic in its assertion that "human beings are the center of concern to 
sustainable development" and as such they were entitled to a healthy and 
productive life in harmony with nature. This position was recently reaffirmed in 
the Human Development Report 1996 which reminded the world that "human 
development is the end and economic growth is the means" and that the purpose of 
growth should be to enrich peoples' lives. In too many instances, unfortunately, 
this was not the case. In its most recent findings, the report noted that growth 
has been failing about one-third of the world's peoples in about a hundred 
countries for much of the last 15 years, and that lopsided development likewise 
had been failing to preserve the link between growth and human development with 
good growth and little or no human development in some instances and good human 
development but little or no growth in others. For economic growth to be 
successful, however, and to genuinely advance the human cause, much more 
attention will have to be given to the structure and quality of growth in order 
to ensure that it is directed to supporting human development, reducing poverty, 
protecting the environment and ensuring the quality of life. 
<P><B>Agriculture</B> 
<P>In its projection of humanity's agricultural future, Agenda 21 estimates 
that, viewed against the background of a global population of 8.5 billion people 
by the year 2025, 83% of whom will be living in developing countries, "the 
capacity of available resources and technology to satisfy the demands of this 
growing population for food and other agricultural commodities remain 
uncertain". To meet the challenge, agriculture will be obliged to utilize land 
already in use and avoid further encroachment of land that is only marginally 
suitable for cultivation. To this end, major adjustments in agricultural 
policies are needed to create the conditions necessary for sustainable 
agricultural and rural development (SARD). Such policies will be successful, 
however, only to the degree that they, "involve education initiatives, 
utilization of economic incentives, and the development of appropriate new 
technologies thus ensuring stable supplies of nutritionally adequate food, 
access to those supplies by vulnerable groups and the production for market, 
employment and income generation to alleviate poverty and natural resource 
management and environmental protection"7. Seven hundred million people are 
chronically malnourished. This number and other figures have led to projections 
that food production may in fact have to triple to provide adequate nutrition 
for all. Compounding troubling population and environmental trends is a growing 
acknowledgment that the Green Revolution of the 1960s to the 1980s -- which 
provided reassuring evidence of the power of agricultural science -- was 
stalling.
<P><B>Oceans</B>
<P>
<P>In the development of a comprehensive program for the protection of the seas 
and oceans of our planet, Earth Summit leaders were unanimous in their 
affirmation that the "marine environment formed an integral whole that is an 
essential component of the global life support system and a positive asset that 
presents opportunities for sustainable development". This reality was stated 
even more bluntly by the Brundtland Commission in a report to the United Nations 
five years earlier which argued that "...in the earth's wheel of life, the 
oceans provide the balance". And that balance is now being threatened in almost 
all seas and oceans and must be quickly reset if the vital ecological and 
economic services they perform are to be maintained. 
<P>In perhaps the clearest popular account of just how far and how fast that 
balance is being upset, Michael Specter8 noted that "The last decade has not 
been easy on the world's oceans, the largest and seemingly least vulnerable 
resource on earth". 
<P>Among the most discouraging trends are giant tumors on turtles, PCBs in the 
flesh of fish, amnesic shellfish poisoning of humans by algae blooms - many of 
these were unknown 30 years ago. And while there is no significantly certain way 
to prove a pattern, or to assert that human beings are to blame, the 
deterioration has escalated notably in the last decade. Autopsies on beluga 
whales -- sometimes called the most polluted animal on earth - regularly find 
ulcers, cancers, immune deficiencies and lung infections that may be caused by 
the mercury, lead, PCBs and other toxins that quietly accumulate in their 
blubber every time they swallow a fish from the rivers of Europe or America. 
<P>Specter then noted that even the essential chemical balance at many river 
mouths has changed as nitrogen-rich fertilizers and acid rain have increased 
while fresh water is siphoned off by dams and development. As the water's 
composition changes, so does the sea's intricate food chain -- starting with 
plankton, and ending with people. 
<P>Other dimensions of the crisis are becoming even more manifest as coral 
reefs, one of the planet's most productive ecosystems, are dying at an alarming 
rate. Numerous factors are to blame for the coral reef's die-off, including 
"ocean pollution from coastal run-off" and gradual warming of the world's oceans 
due to the greenhouse effect. But recent reports suggest that fish collectors, 
especially in the South Pacific and Southeast Asia are among those causing the 
most damage to the reefs. These fish hunters often use sodium cyanide which is 
dumped in the water to stun the fish which are then shipped alive to restaurants 
and collectors throughout Asia. Sodium cyanide, which is toxic, destroys the 
reefs' micro- organisms as well as cause numerous health problems among 
fishermen. It is now estimated that as much as 80% of the Philippines' coral 
reefs have been damaged by sedimentation, explosive and toxic pollution. 
<P>At another level, the scope of the crisis which has even more immediate 
implications for human society was further elaborated by the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which noted that as much as one-third of 200 
fisheries which it monitors world-wide are being depleted or being over-fished. 
Moreover, throughout the world, fishcatch is in a steady state of decline; 1988 
being the last year when the catch topped 100 million tons. And whereas a 
variety of factors have contributed to the current situation, a key element may 
be the surplus of fishing boats, plus more efficient fishery techniques and such 
advanced technologies as sonar, and the use of factory ships as well as 
substantial subsidies. 
<P>According to a recent <B>Business Week</B> report, since 1989 "...too many 
boats chasing too few fish have kept the world's fishing fleets operating at a 
loss despite $54 billion in annual subsidies". Moreover, the subsidies have 
accelerated the expansion of fishing vessels which now total some 1.2 million 
boats, a 30% increase over 1975 levels. The implications of this dramatic 
expansion may best be observed in Alaska where it now takes the 5,000 or so 
boats that fish the halibut just 30 hours to catch their limit versus 120 days 
in the mid-70s.9 
<P>Clearly, such practices are unsustainable and pose serious ecological, 
economic and social problems for many nations especially in regions that are 
dependent upon fishery, and could very well become a source of tension, if not 
conflict, among states. 
<P><B>C. Select Examples of Foundation Initiatives: Leverage and Multipliers</B> 

<P><B>The Energy Programme of the Rockefeller Foundation</B> 
<P>Considerable progress has been made in the quest to achieve energy 
sustainability with the help of the Rockefeller Foundation's Energy Programme. 
This program has been instrumental in moving forward the development of 
sustainable and renewable energy resources and technologies, both in developed 
and developing countries. 
<P><B>Climate Institute</B> 
<P>As a result of a small number of grants, the Climate Institute was able to 
mobilize considerable scientific expertise which it brought to bare on issues of 
climate change and their predicted effects on both developed and developing 
countries. These initiatives, in time, were expanded to include collaboration 
with UNEP in the development of the principal elements for the Climate Change 
Convention. 
<P><B>Smart Wood</B> 
<P>A similar initiative which resulted in considerable impact on the forestry 
sector concerns the Rainforest Alliance's Smart Wood program. Under this 
program, the Rainforest Alliance has succeeded in applying the most advanced 
findings in forestry conservation and research to the logging industry and to 
bring loggers, manufacturers, conservationists, and consumers together to work 
for the sustainable exploitation of forests. 
<P><B>Sustainable Northwest</B> 
<P>Many foundations increasingly recognize that communities are beginning to 
take responsibility as stakeholders in protecting local environments and 
promoting the cause of sustainability at the local level. This is particularly 
true in those communities with single or limited resource-based economies, and 
the Pacific Northwest is pioneering a number of initiatives where through small 
grants from foundations, they are able to launch broad education programs and 
political strategies for protecting the natural resources for which their 
livelihoods depend. Many of these initiatives are directly related to issues 
raised in Agenda 21, which in a number of instances have served to inspire 
action. 
<P><B>Rockefeller Foundation's Energy Programme</B></FONT> 
<P><B>In its commitment to finding innovative ways to promote more extensive 
energy efficiency and to accelerate the introduction of renewable energy 
resources, the foundation has launched a major energy initiative with four 
concrete programs:</B> 
<P>a) <B>E&amp;Co.</B>, a nonprofit international energy service was created 
with foundation funding in 1994 to promote the transition from traditional 
systems of generating energy to a new energy paradigm of ecologically sound and 
economically viable patterns of energy production and use. Among the activities 
of E&amp;Co. are the provision of small grants to entrepreneurs, technical 
assistance, liaison with international funders and direct investment in 
projects. To foster cooperative energy projects, grants are designed to 
encourage similar investment from other sources including government, the 
private sector, multilateral institutions and consumers;
<P>b) <B>Solar Electric Light Fund</B> received foundation funding to complete 
the purchase of an equity share of a Chinese-American company that manufactures 
photovoltaic (PV) power generating systems in western China. Already, production 
and sales of PV units by this company have exceeded original predictions in 
large part because of an unexpectedly high level of demand for PV systems from 
nomadic herdsman, an unexpected market niche;
<P>
<P>c) <B>Solar Energy Ocean Energy, Inc.</B> in Jamaica received foundation 
support in its efforts to demonstrate the commercial viability of hybrid solar 
and ocean thermal-energy conversion technology as an affordable means of 
generating power. This technology, which mixes solar-heated surface waters with 
cooler waters from the ocean depths to generate electricity, is environmentally 
benign and relies on the natural resources and climate of tropical island 
nations, significantly reducing the need to import more expensive sources of 
energy; 
<P>d) <B>The feasibility study of the Integrated Solar Combined Cycle System</B> 
in Mexico which is supported by the Foundation is nearing completion. The 
$260,000 provided by the Foundation is part of a public/private development 
effort for this unique technology and has demonstrated the way public funds can 
be used trather, excessive and wasteful consumption -- by rich com
<P><B>Climate Institute</B> 
<P>Even before the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 
Rio de Janeiro several U.S. foundations had assumed a catalytic role in 
promoting global environmental protection. 
<P>These U.S. foundations working with the Climate Institute, an international 
environmental organization founded in July 1986, were instrumental through 
modest resource commitments in vaulting the climate change issue into the 
international policy arena. 
<P>A particularly crucial role was played by The William Bingham Foundation, a 
medium-sized Cleveland-based philanthropy which funded the first symposium on 
climate change for United Nations missions in June 1988. This one day meeting 
drew representatives from about two dozen United Nations permanent missions, a 
half dozen UN organizations, a number of environmental groups and several 
foundations. Held under the auspices of the United Nations Environment 
Programme, this Climate Institute organized meeting, like the symposium three 
months earlier in Washington, focused on implications of climate change for 
developing countries. Although there was a paucity of credible impact analysis 
of climate change effects on developing countries, the Institute assembled a 
diverse group of experts from industrialized and developing countries. 
<P>At this June, 1988 meeting the idea was germinated of a world conference on 
climate change in Cairo, Egypt the next year under joint sponsorship of the 
Climate Institute and UNEP. The 1988 UN Symposium's funder, the William Bingham 
Foundation agreed to provide a matching grant of up to $25,000 to support the 
Cairo World Conference on Preparing for Climate Change held December 17-21, 
1989. This challenge grant and $50,000 in travel funds for developing country 
speakers arranged by UNEP through its Executive Director, Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, 
a Cairo resident, were instrumental in gelling support for this watershed 
conference which drew over 400 delegates from about 40 nations. Ultimately the 
Cairo Conference drew support of 27 sponsors who provided somewhat more than 
$350,000 to support this meeting. Among these was the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore 
Foundation whose Chair and Treasurer, had attended the Institute's June 1988 UN 
Symposium. Besides strong support from Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, the 
Climate Institute's rapidly evolving international program focused on developing 
countries drew crucial support from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation which 
provided seed money annual grants of $35,000 in each of three years, 1989, 1990, 
and 1991. 
<P>The Cairo Conference under the Chairmanship of Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba produced 
a conference declaration, the Cairo Compact, that provided a strong impetus to 
the negotiation of the climate treaty signed in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The 
Cairo Compact called for completion of a framework climate convention prior to 
the time of the Rio UNCED. It called for action by both "affluent nations" and 
"poorer nations" with the former providing the latter "additional financial and 
technological resources... to enable them to restrain greenhouse gas emissions 
and adapt to climate change." 
<P>Anticipating that the Cairo Conference product could lay the groundwork for 
the negotiation of a climate treaty, a number of environmental lawyers and 
climate experts, e.g. coastal, water resources, scientific research and 
monitoring and emissions mitigation, to team-up in an International Workshop on 
a Framework Convention and Associated Protocols: A Nongovernmental Perspective 
to be held in Washington, D.C. February 2-4, 1990, just six weeks after the 
conclusion of the Cairo Conference. 
<P>The draft framework convention on climate change produced by this weekend 
piggyback conclave at a cost of about $4000 was remarkably close to the language 
of the document ultimately signed twenty eight months later by over 150 
governments in Rio de Janeiro. 
<P><B>Smart Wood Program </B>
<P>Background: Initiated in 1989, Smart Wood, a program supported by grants from 
Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation and Sequoia Foundation, is the first and 
largest forestry certification program in existence. Smart Wood is a program of 
the Rainforest Alliance, an international nonprofit environmental group based in 
New York City. Though the program initially focused on tropical forests, today 
Smart Wood works in all forest types worldwide, Smart Wood is managed by a 
headquarters staff of experienced forestry specialists based at Rainforest 
Alliance offices in New York and Vermont, in collaboration with the growing 
number of cooperating nonprofit organizations in the Smart Wood Network (see 
below).
<P>The purpose of Smart Wood is to provide independent, objective evaluation of 
forest management practices, forest products, timber sources and companies, 
enabling the public to identify products and practices that do not destroy 
forests. Through certification, and use of the Smart Wood label, the program 
provides a commercial incentive for forest managers to adopt sustainable forest 
practices. Smart Wood certifies forest products that come from "sustainable" or 
well-managed" forests ("sources"). Candidate sources may include a natural 
forest, a plantation, a large commercial operation or a small- scale community 
project. Smart Wood also certifies companies that process, manufacture or sell 
products made from certified wood, through "chain of custody" certification.
<P>Forest Monitoring for Carbon Offset, Environmental Protection, Financial 
Investments, and Other Purposes: Smart Wood also evaluates forestry operations 
for other purposes, such as determining a project's compliance with government 
or donor environmental standards or assessing the suitability of a project for 
investments that are conditioned upon the use of sustainable forest management 
practices. Smart Wood is also monitoring "forestry carbon offset" programs. In 
forestry carbon offsets, investments in the conservation and management of 
forest are made by companies such as electric utilities in recognition of the 
forest's value as a carbon sink for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions. Since 
November 1992 Smart Wood has participated in designing and implementing a field 
monitoring program for the first natural forest management carbon offset project 
in the world in Sabah, Malaysia, as a service to an electric utility company 
(New England Energy Services, Inc.) The project is analyzing the benefits of 
such initiatives and refining techniques for field monitoring and verification 
of benefits. The Smart Wood program is also engaged in dialogue with 
governmental bodies (e.g., White House, United Nations), companies and other 
organizations concerned with developing policies that encourage balanced and 
credible carbon offset efforts in both the energy and forestry sectors.
<P><B>Smart Wood Network:</B> To facilitate credible and low-cost evaluation, 
monitoring and certification in all forest types, Smart Wood has developed the 
Smart Wood Network, composed of collaborating nonprofit organizations throughout 
the world. This constantly expanding network has staff representatives in 
Central and South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Mexico), six regions of the United States (California, Florida, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Vermont), and expanding coverage in Europe, Southeast 
Asia and Africa. A complete list of current Smart Wood representatives can be 
obtained through Smart Wood headquarters. Network representatives offer the 
complete range of Smart Wood services, including forest and chain of custody 
certification and access to the internationally recognized Smart Wood label. The 
advantages of certification through the non-profit Smart Wood Network include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>high credibility and acceptance with local environmental groups, 
  scientists, government and forest industry; thus reducing environmental or 
  corporate risk and fostering positive local relationships; 
  <LI>low cost certification and monitoring services; 
  <LI>immediate, local access to multilingual representatives of the Smart Wood 
  program; 
  <LI>access to, and understanding of, certified forest products markets 
  worldwide; and

size=+2>Sustainable Northwest:<BR>Human Capital, Community Development and 
Sustainable Resource Management<FONT size=+0> 
<P><B>The mission of Sustainable Northwest, a small, non-profit NGO, is to 
strengthen local capacity to promote environmentally sound economic development 
in communities of the Pacific Northwest (in the U.S.). To fulfil this mission, 
Sustainable Northwest has devised a three-part strategy:</B> 
<OL>
  <LI>Partnerships for Community Sustainability -- Engage rural communities in 
  economically viable and environmentally sustainable projects that strengthen 
  their self-reliance, long-term vitality and commitment to place and people. 
  <LI>Information and Tools for Sustainable Communities -- Share ideas, 
  examples, expertise and technologies that help build local, regional and 
  national understanding of the linkages between economy, ecosystem, and 
  community. 
  <LI>Regional and Systemic Change -- Facilitate communication, learning and 
  development of cooperative solutions between communities, agencies, interest 
  groups, and the non-profit and private sectors. </LI></OL>
<P>Sustainable Northwest is currently focusing its efforts in the Interior 
Columbia River Basin, a vast and diverse region where soil, water, forest, 
wildlife and mineral-resources drew settlers and fuelled extractive industry 
development. More recent arrivals however, have increasingly influenced resource 
utilization policies and challenged traditional lifestyle values. The resulting 
tensions can either create endless conflict or catalyze new collaborative 
efforts that build on the energy, determination, self-reliance and creativity of 
a diverse citizen. 
<P>The operating premise of Snw is that local communities can and should become 
effective stewards of the land, in partnership with agencies and national 
interest groups. But too often rural communities are singled-out as the cause of 
poor land and ecosystem conditions and treated as the problem rather than as 
potential conservation allies. Engaging the constructive energies of rural 
residents, SNw assists them to identify locally-grounded solutions to both 
environmental and economic challenges by offering direct support to economic 
development projects that stress responsible stewardship of natural resources.
<P><B>Three encouraging examples SNW projects include:</B>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Wallowa County, Oregon </B>-- In this its first project, SNw explored 
  environmentally sound economic development opportunities in the forestry 
  sector. With the aim of promoting forest and watershed health, a task force 
  was formed to prepare landowners to participate in sustainable forest 
  management and watershed restoration activities, build on the example of 
  exemplary land stewards in the area, develop local sustainable forestry 
  standards, and encourage cooperative approaches to land management. Other job 
  opportunities exist in land restoration activities and in developing tourism 
  options for the region. The final objective of this effort is to help build 
  community understanding through stakeholder dialogues and the development of 
  interest groups. 
  <LI><B>Okanogan County, Washington</B> -- A group of local organic farmers are 
  exploring the potential of developing a shared processing kitchen facility. 
  With local partners, SNw developed a needs assessment to gauge interest in 
  using such a facility. In addition, stakeholder meetings have been convened by 
  SNw to help residents debate alternative uses of the resources of the Okanogan 
  National Forest. 
  <LI><B>Council, Idaho</B> -- A small, one industry town on the border of the 
  State, Council was devastated when a large wood processing mill was closed. 
  SNw was able to facilitate the transfer of the mill to the town. The original 
  owner has agreed to finance the clean-up efforts and the town will use the 
  developed site to attract new business, creating up to an estimated 30 jobs.

<P><FONT size=+2>IV. Conclusions</FONT> 
<P>In evaluating the response of major U.S. foundations to the UNCED meeting in 
general and Agenda 21 in particular, it is important to emphasize that many 
foundations had been responding to environment/development issues years before 
UNCED and these pioneering initiatives continue to contribute to the 
implementation of Agenda 21. Although the concept of sustainable development 
received wide currency since the Brundtland Commission commended it in 1987, the 
term itself had been used before in the <B>World Conservation Strategy</B> 
prepared by IUCN, UNEP, and WWF in 1980.
<P>The Consultative Group on Biological Diversity (CGBD), consisting of forty 
foundations and the U.S. Agency for International Development, has been in 
existence since 1987. This consortium supports foundation activity in the field 
of biodiversity conservation, and serves as the nexus for its members. Its 1996 
working group program areas were: forests, conservation of marine biodiversity, 
systemic contaminants, and conservation &amp; development.
<P>Similar consortia could be established to support foundation activity in 
other Agenda 21 sectors, i.e. climate change, population, etc. The goals of 
consortia like CGBD could be to: create partnerships among funders; improve the 
quality of grant-making; increase the quantity of grant-making; identify gaps in 
current funding patterns; target priority subjects and geographic regions, and 
broaden the public constituency.
<P>In 1988, The Rockefeller Foundation pointed out that it was important to 
integrate concern for the global environment with the international and 
technical dimensions of their Science-Based Development programs in 
agricultural, health, and population sciences with an emphasis on developing 
nations, and to insist that the issues of development and the environment are 
structured as part of one overall framework. This set the stage for their Global 
Environmental Program that was launched in 1989. In 1991 two major initiatives 
were established: (1) Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD) and (2) 
the International Energy Initiative (IEI), both focused on developing countries.
<P>The MacArthur Foundation initiated the World Environment and Resources 
Program in 1989 to underscore the Foundation's commitment to sustainable 
development in regions where large numbers of people depend on local natural 
resources for survival.
<P>Again -- prior to UNCED -- the Ford Foundation through Rural Poverty and 
Resources and other programs supported research on the links between economic 
and ecological concerns as well as activities to strengthen public and private 
institutions working to advance environmentally sound economic development. The 
Foundation also sought to encourage ties among local, regional and national 
environmental organizations. It supported the design and replication of 
innovations leading to more equitable allocation of such resources as land and 
water, and funded projects intended to advance knowledge of the global 
dimensions of sustainable development.
<P>The Kellogg Foundation supported agriculture, education, health, leadership 
and youth (all important sectors of Agenda 21) before UNCED.
<P>Another pre-Rio initiative to encourage a more integrated approach was the 
establishment of The Energy Foundation by the Rockefeller, MacArthur, and Pew 
Foundations, to assist in the transition to a sustainable energy future by 
promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in the U.S. Similar 
collaborative initiatives could respond to other Agenda 21 sectors in order to 
help operationalize sustainable development at the national and local level and 
support the requirement that global sustainable development policies and 
practices be based on sustainability policies and practices at the national and 
local level not the other way around.
<P>In 1991, the Andrew Mellon Foundation was supporting programs in Conservation 
and the Environment and Population. Also pre-Rio, the Jessie Smith Noyes 
Foundation was focused on tropical ecology, water and toxics, sustainable 
agriculture, and population and reproductive rights. It is significant that 
these foundations recognized the interrelatedness of areas like environment and 
population and the need to protect natural systems and ensure a sustainable 
society before UNCED.
<P>It is also important to underscore that U.S. foundations contributed to the 
UNCED meeting in a variety of ways.
<P>In 1991, the Ford Foundation supported projects designed to facilitate the 
participation of women, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organizations and 
developing countries in the discussions leading up to UNCED. The Foundation also 
supported a study of the challenges to the international system posed by global 
environment problems, the preparation of the Brundtland Commission for UNCED and 
efforts to raise the press coverage of the Conference. 
<P>The MacArthur Foundation in 1991 supported roundtable meetings and the 
publication of policy papers with the goal of securing agreement among 
participating nations for the signing of the U.N.'s 1982 Law of the Sea 
Convention.
<P><B>A. Criteria or Indicators for Evaluation</B>
<P>Two categories of criteria or indicators are recommended to evaluate the 
response of the U.S. philanthropic sector to the UNCED meeting in general and 
Agenda 21 in particular: (1) process and (2) content.
<P><B>Process Criteria or Indicators and Selected Examples</B>
<P>Some examples of how foundations have successfully applied the recommended 
criteria or indicators follow.
<P>Simplify the processes and principles involved with making sustainable 
development work, i.e. contribute to the development of a core knowledge base 
and a standardized language 
<P>The Environmental Grantmakers Association (EGA) with support from three 
foundations, Nathan Cummings, Joyce, and Rockefeller Brothers Fund, prepared a 
guide for grantmakers on Agriculture and the Environment: Promoting Sustainable 
Agriculture in the 1995 Farm Bill and beyond. This guide is a useful model for 
others on specific topics that could be developed to simplify needed information 
for operationalizing sustainable development at the national and local level. 
<P>Move beyond "piecemeal" efforts to build and integrate "systemic" management 
systems that effectively address the interrelatedness of sustainability issues 
<P>The Rockefeller Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation helped to 
plan, organize, and fund a forum on Population, Environment and Development, 
organized by The Rene Dubos Center for Human Environments, to serve as a bridge 
between Rio and Cairo by convening more than seventy-five authorities on 
demography, ecology, sociology, energy use, climatology, and economics, drawn 
from five continents and spanning the ideological spectrum. Their mission was to 
examine the linkages between population growth and four significant 
environmental issues: biological diversity, global warming, air/water resource 
management, and land use. 
<P>Require global sustainable development policies and practices be based on 
sustainability policies and practices at the national and local level not the 
other way around. The Ford Foundation's community-based approaches to natural 
resources management advance that approach in relationship to forests, 
fisheries, grazing land, water, and wildlife in Africa, Asia, Latin America and 
the U.S. 
<P>Encourage open processes, identification of stakeholders, and full 
participation as first steps 
<P>The Rockefeller Foundation sponsored the Dubos Forum on Technological 
Prospects for Sustainable Agriculture organized by The Rene Dubos Center for 
Human Environments and held at The Rockefeller Foundation's Study and Conference 
Center in Bellagio, Italy with additional funding from the Henry P. Kendall 
Foundation. Scientists and economists representing five continents focused on 
where agricultural research and technology development should be focused to find 
solutions to two key questions: How can we feed a world population that is 
expected to double before leveling off? and How can we produce sufficient food 
without substantial environmental harm?
<P>Help operationalize sustainable development, particularly at the local and 
national levels 
<P>The Ford Foundation's Conservation-Based Community Development Initiative 
supports community economic development and resource conservation by helping to 
create jobs that sustain the ecosystem.
<P>A broad base of external support, including Ford Foundation, MacArthur 
Foundation, and Sequoia Foundation, underlies the training efforts of the 
Rainforest Alliance and the Mexican Council for Sustainable Silviculture in 
providing the world's first formal training course in environmental forestry 
certification -- starting with twenty professionals from eight Latin American 
countries -- to meet the need for local certification auditors.
<P>Develop collaborative initiatives on sustainable development that involve two 
or more organizations tackling the same problem, but from different 
perspectives, to create new approaches 
<P>"Defining Sustainable Communities", a project of the Tides Foundation with 
support from 16 other foundations, is committed to creating a new collaborative 
model based on the belief that environment, community development, social 
justice and health are integrally linked.
<P>Develop collaborative sustainable development initiatives inhouse with 
program staff from different areas working together to learn from each other 
<P>Peace and International Cooperation, Population, and World Environment and 
Resources -- three programs of the MacArthur Foundation -- developed 
Collaborative Studies on Human Societies and Environmental Change.
<P>Designate a special program area for cross-cutting initiatives that embody 
the sustainability category The Rockefeller Foundation's Global Environment 
Division continues two major initiatives: (1) Leadership for Environment and 
Development (LEAD) -- to build human capital for leadership that will help 
preserve the environment, promote fair and sustainable development, and forge 
international agreements to accomplish these ends -- and (2) E&amp;Co., a 
nonprofit international energy service to facilitate the transition to a new, 
sustainable-energy paradigm by promoting energy enterprises in developing 
countries.
<P>The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's World Environment and 
Resource Program supports conservation, public education, policy studies, and 
sustainable development projects relating to key environmental issues in the 
tropics. The program seeks to increase understanding of the delicate 
relationship between the health of the biosphere and the welfare of human 
communities. With its focus on biodiversity the program links environmental 
concerns and economic needs, conservation and commerce.
<P><B>The Rockefeller Brothers Fund's One World:</B> Sustainable Resource Use 
Program fosters environmental stewardship which is ecologically based, 
economically sound, culturally appropriate, and sensitive to questions of 
intergenerational equity. Strategies on climate change focus on utility-based 
energy efficiency, renewable energy, transportation, and green taxes; strategies 
on biodiversity preservation focus on an ecosystem approach with an emphasis on 
temperate rainforests and fishery and coastal zone management.
<P><B>Additional process criteria/indicators include:</B> (1) promote 
considerable cooperation among different stakeholders to achieve sustainability; 
(2) draw previously marginalized people into policy debates, leading to the 
formulation and implementation of more responsible environmental and economic 
policies; (3) utilize up-to-date, reliable non-technical information that 
incorporates different perspectives on achieving sustainability; (4) facilitate 
the ability to make choices based on an understanding of the trade-offs, 
alternatives, and resulting consequences of achieving sustainability; (5) create 
a separate long-term funding program for sustainability projects to increase the 
time horizon for determining the success of a project; (6) develop a separate 
"risk" fund for innovative projects that attempt innovative approaches; and (7) 
reconsider blanket prohibitions on conferences or meetings on sustainable 
development. 
<P><B>Content Criteria/Indicators and Selected Examples <BR>Focus on 
conservation of biodiversity</B> 
<P>In light of the declining prospect for biodiversity, there is all the greater 
need for supplementary funds, especially those that can make incisive 
contributions. This means there is a unique challenge for U.S. foundations. In 
1995 foundations that generated most funding for biodiversity worldwide were 
MacArthur, followed by--on a far smaller scale -- W. Alton Jones and Rockefeller 
Brothers Fund, with a total of a little over $20 million, of which the great 
bulk was for biodiversity in developing countries. 
<P>One way of tackling priorities is to focus on "hotspots". These are areas 
that (a) feature exceptional numbers of species with exceptional levels of 
endemism, and (b) face exceptional threat of habitat destruction. As many as 20 
percent of Earth's plant species and a still higher proportion of animal species 
are confined to 18 hot spots comprising 0.5 percent of Earth's land surface 
(Myers, 1990). This finding allows conservation planners to concentrate on areas 
where investment will yield the highest payoff.
<P>The hotspots opportunity has been addressed by a remarkable initiative on the 
part of the MacArthur Foundation. In 1989 its World Environment and Resources 
Program embarked on a major effort to safeguard hotspots. Thus far the 
foundation has funded conservation activities in virtually all the 18 hotspots 
cited (plus a few others), working mostly through on-ground NGOs. Total funds 
disbursed from 1989 through 1996 amounted to some $150 million, for a rough 
average of almost $19 million per year. This should surely rank as one of the 
most substantive and closely targeted of all biodiversity investments since the 
start-up of conservation efforts forty years ago. 
<P><B>Support forest-related issues</B> 
<P>The World Environment and Resources program of The John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation supported the Tropical Forest Foundation's efforts to 
promote sustained yield forest management projects that demonstrate low-impact 
logging techniques in Brazil's Amazon basin with an $180,000 grant in 1995.
<P>The World Wildlife Fund received a $1.1 million grant in 1995 from The Pew 
Charitable Trusts to help protect and conserve British Columbia's threatened 
ancient forests and wilderness areas.
<P>There are other forms of forestry support that lend themselves to foundation 
input: for example, the need for grassroots involvement. There is an important 
role for U.S. foundations to support smaller-sized projects which otherwise 
cannot obtain funds from large donors and especially official sources. 
<P>Another way for foundations to make an incisive intervention is to support 
research that could identify key factors such as "deforestation fronts" in 
tropical forests (plus possibly Siberia). Through a marginal amount of research 
funding, the Joint Research Centre under the European Commission has established 
that almost half of all tropical deforestation occurs in just 14 fronts 
comprising less than one quarter of all tropical forests (Myers, 1993). As with 
biodiversity hotspots, this opens the way for responses on the part of forestry 
agencies of the European Union in conjunction with the World Bank, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, NGOs, etc. The research also demonstrates that 
deforestation is primarily due to nine factors (population pressures, poverty, 
rural infrastructure, etc.), that collectively allow development of "early 
warning" criteria for future foci of deforestation--thus enabling policy makers, 
land-use planners and forestry experts to engage in preventative measures. This 
is precisely the sort of imaginative and pioneering research that could 
represent an unusually productive contribution by U.S. foundations.
<P><B>Support climate change issues</B> 
<P>Several foundations have already been quite active in this sphere and their 
contributions had profound impact and far-reaching implications ranging from 
cabinet-level briefings, pioneering studies on regional and national impacts and 
outlining the principles on which the Convention is based. One area where urgent 
and imaginative work remains to be done is consensus-building for national 
climate policies. So far, few governments can claim anything approaching a 
national consensus supportive of the Climate Convention, and even fewer seem 
likely to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 
the year 2000. 
<P>In the United Kingdom, sizable shifting from natural coal to gas, a more 
economic as well as greenhouse benign energy source, has made achieving these 
greenhouse targets possible. In Germany, significant reductions seem possible 
due to the closing of many energy inefficient industrial facilities in the 
former East Germany and the initiation of aggressive efficiency measures on a 
country wide basis. Most other industrial countries are likely by 2000 to have 
emissions significantly exceeding year 1990 levels with U.S. emissions mirroring 
this trend. Emissions are growing much more rapidly in developing countries. 
<P>It would be timely for foundations to support meetings of key stakeholders in 
such areas as energy, transportation and agriculture to work on the development 
of national climate policies. For instance, The Rockefeller Foundation together 
with the Moriah Fund has put substantial sums into work of the Climate 
Institute, including an assessment of the scope for alternatives to fossil-fuel 
energy such as biofuels, plus a series of minister-level briefings in developing 
countries on climate change.
<P>The Third Convention of the Parties (COP3) of the Climate Change Convention 
to be held at Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 would seem to provide a unique and 
significant opportunity for foundations to contribute meaningfully to the 
implementation process and perhaps place the U.S. in a more strategic position 
to exercise leadership and exert influence based on a solid foundation of public 
support. On 17 January 1997, the U.S. government submitted to the conference 
secretariat a proposal for an emissions protocol that would set up binding 
emissions levels for industrialized countries that choose to ratify the 
protocol. Patterned after the mid-1980s EPA rule-making on lead in gasoline and 
the 1990 U.S. 
<P>Clean Air Amendments permitting CO2 trading, the U.S. proposal would seek to 
reduce emissions mitigation costs by permitting trading among parties to the 
protocol, allowing them to bank excess emissions reductions and to borrow from 
future years. To increase flexibility, the proposal would permit the binding 
targets to be yearly averages over periods as long as a decade. Despite the 
intellectual elegance of the recent U.S. proposal, it may have three drawbacks.
<P>The most fundamental is that there seems little likelihood that such a 
protocol, if approved at COP3, would receive the necessary two-thirds majority 
in the U.S. Senate required for U.S. ratification. In the judgement of most 
observers including key Administration officials, a binding emissions protocol 
might capture a bare majority of votes in the U.S. but would, for the next 
several years, have little possibility of achieving the two-thirds vote required 
for U.S. ratification. Refusal of the U.S., the world's largest emitter of 
greenhouse emissions, to ratify an emissions protocol might convert it to 
nullify much as the U.S. refusal to participate in the League of Nations led to 
the failure of that body. Secondly, the long time period before parties would be 
clearly out of compliance if they exceeded negotiated target levels, about 20 to 
30 years from now, is so well into the future that it may do little to affect 
corporate strategy energy investment decisions. Third, the U.S. proposal does 
relatively little to encourage developing countries, the likeliest source of 
most emissions growth, to limit greenhouse emissions. 
<P>
<P>To minimize the possibility of a breakdown in climate negotiations, it is 
important to work on several fronts. An essential precondition for U.S. action 
to support further emissions reductions is a wide scale public recognition of 
the potential implications of climate change for the U.S. and of the role of 
U.S. energy consumption in contributing to global climate change.
<P>Success of a global greenhouse emissions limitation strategy will also depend 
heavily on an active commitment to energy efficiency and expanded reliance on 
greenhouse benign energy by key developing countries. To this end, it is helpful 
that planners and decision makers in developing countries are aware of the 
implications of climate change for their countries and of the potential of cost 
effective energy efficiency and renewable measures to limit their greenhouse 
emissions.
<P>To achieve these changed perceptions in the U.S. and in developing countries, 
the philanthropic community should undertake some highly focused initiatives 
prior to COP3 including the development and placement on the Internet of a guide 
to policymakers on climate change implications.
<P><B>Help to combat poverty</B> 
<P>The Ford Foundation provided a grant of $223,000 in 1994 to the Santiago 
Development Corporation in Chile to support an urban revitalization program in a 
poor, inner-city neighborhood as a model for participating community economic 
development.
<P><B>Help to change consumption patterns</B> 
<P>The National Religious Partnership for the Environment, Inc. received 
$323,000 from the Pew Memorial Trust to develop and test outreach materials for 
five major faith groups and denominations on consumption issues, and to assemble 
a team of religious scholars to identify and present theological teaching 
concerning population, consumption and environmental issues to policy makers and 
the media.
<P><B>Promote sustainable agriculture</B> 
<P>The W.K. Kellogg Foundation's Food Systems and Rural Development program 
provided the Agricultural School of the Humid Tropical Region in Costa Rica with 
a grant of $1.19 million in 1995 to improve food supply, agricultural 
sustainability and the environment by providing educational opportunities to 
economically disadvantaged kids.
<P>The Rockefeller Foundation's Agricultural Sciences program offers support for 
a wide variety of agricultural programs around the world. It provided the China 
National Rice Research Institute with a grant of $110,000 in 1995 for research 
into novel rice improvements while granting the Association for Better Land 
Husbandry $112,000 to promote organic farming in Kenya. 
<P><B>Focus on protection of the marine environment</B> 
<P>The David and Lucille Packard Foundation is very active in the protection of 
marine resources. For example, it granted the Conservation Law Foundation 
$80,000 in 1994 to restore New England's depleted fisheries, while supporting 
the efforts of the Conservation Foundation to help aid the Galapagos Islands 
manage its own fisheries crisis with a $16,000 grant in 1995. 
<P>The Pew Charitable Trusts provided a grant of $120,000 in 1995 to the 
Regional Fisheries Initiative and the Alaska Marine Conservation Council to 
promote policies aimed at reducing bycatch in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska 
offshore fisheries. 
<P><B>Support education, public awareness and training</B> 
<P>The Belize Zoo &amp; Tropical Education Center received a $140,000 grant from 
The
<P>John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for natural history training 
programs aimed at school children, educators, residents of protected areas, and 
tour guides. 
<P><B>Promote human resource development</B> 
<P>Professional Assistance for Development Action, an India-based N.G.O., 
received $157,000 from the Ford Foundation's Rural Poverty and Assistance 
program for its efforts to improve rural livelihoods in India by providing 
financial services for women and development banks for the poor. 
<P><B>B. Recommendations</B>
<P><B>Additional suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the initiative 
of the U.S. foundations in relation to the UNCED mandate follow.</B> 
<P>Provision of auspices for exploring new and creative ways of financing the 
sustainable development agenda. 
<P>One of the most urgent issues to be addressed is the question of financing. 
This was the subject of a recently held U.N. expert meeting in Santiago, Chile 
that drew some very sobering conclusions, particularly in connection with the 
status of the Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) Programme that shows very 
significant signs of decline and may even be reduced for lack of political will 
and changing global interests and priorities of the major donors. Some have even 
suggested that ODA may have served the interests of the Cold War and not 
development and with the Cold War now over, the reason for its being may 
likewise have disappeared. This is obviously the pessimistic view. Still, 
looking at the progressive decline of ODA, the U.N. is now beginning to wonder 
whether alternative modes of financing should not now be aggressively pursued. 
<P>In this connection U.S. foundations have a new and even more significant role 
to play. Because of their respected status in society, the composition of their 
boards, with strong linkages to money and power and to new as well as old wealth 
generators, they are in a unique position to provide auspices for the convening 
of high-level meetings of financial and industrial leaders to explore the 
question, "how to generate the resources necessary for financing Agenda 21?" 
<P>Although the question of creating new ways of financing various U.N. agendas 
and action plans have occurred with almost tedious frequency, most of the 
discussions have been held under governmental auspices to which select experts 
have been invited. As the question moves again to center stage, foundations may 
find it timely to join the argument, not with technical experts as such but with 
the real money- makers and the people who make wealth happen -- bankers, brokers 
and business leaders. Such meetings convened under foundations' auspices could 
look at Agenda 21 not only as another government-driven perspective but also as 
a set of challenges to their own futures and the future of their enterprises as 
well as their own livelihood. 
<P><B>Promoting business leadership in sustainable development </B>
<P>As a result of diverse activities and changes, there are rapidly evolving 
opportunities for foundations to leverage innovation. For example, given that we 
are on the verge of a period of profound experimentation, there is a potential 
role for longitudinal research involving the monitoring -- and in some cases, 
the helping -- of companies and even entire industry sectors as they begin to 
make the sustainability transition. The goal should be to watch for barriers or 
constraints that are interrupting the progress of a significant number of 
companies, and to identify ways in which business in conjunction with 
governments and other actors can address these problems. 
<P>Also, foundations could help evaluate the emerging area of industrial 
ecology. This applies particularly to industrial symbioses when several 
companies develop characteristics of an industrial ecosystem, exchanging 
effluents and energy emissions that might otherwise go to waste. 
<P>In addition, foundations can complement their grantmaking activities through 
their investment and fiduciary activities. This applies with respect to three 
notable areas: screened portfolios, venture-related investment, and active 
shareholder involvement. The Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, for instance, has 
made small, direct investments in companies that make enzyme-based cleaners, 
leak detection systems, and shoes from recycled materials, as well as in an 
energy services company and a person-to-person marketer of non-toxic cleaning 
and personal care products (Viederman and Tasch, 1995) 
<P><B>Mobilizing and energizing civil society </B>
<P>Clearly, as the 20th Century draws to a close, two features would seem to be 
manifest. One, the globalization of the democratic spirit; and two, the rise of 
the citizen's sector of the civil society. Increasingly, citizens are beginning 
to take action in defining their future and determining their destiny and 
well-being. They have a very critical role to play in securing the natural 
resources on which their community rests and in developing effective programs of 
action for sustainability. It is recommended that foundations look very closely 
at how they might support civil society and empower them to participate in the 
work of sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21. 
<P><B>Mobilizing the religious and faith communities in a new mission for the 
earth</B> 
<P>All the world's main religions have powerful teachings on how we should care 
for the world, albeit coming from very different understandings and leading to 
different goals. There is no other major social issue upon which all faiths so 
readily agree nor upon which they have all undertaken such major plans. 
<P>In the growing worldwide movement of religious-environmental alliances, the 
Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival is the 
largest and most multi-representative, in addition to being the most celebrated 
because of its orientation, its distinguished membership, and its major global 
conferences. The International Coordinating Committee on Religion and the Earth 
(ICCRE) is a unique consultative body of representatives from the world's major 
spiritual traditions and environmental groups established "to foster the 
relationship between religion and ecology and to address the spiritual dimension 
of the ecological crisis imperiling the earth. Its Earth Charter, inspired the 
only NGO document written for UNCED to reach negotiation stage. This document 
came so close to being adopted that ICCRE was encouraged to continue its 
international work on the Earth Charter toward possible adoption by the U.N. as 
a "declaration of principals and bill of rights for all life on earth." 
<P>As a result of the interfaith collaborations, four major faith groups and 
denominations have established an unprecedented partnership, the National 
Religious Partnership for the Environment, to better reach and educate a 
membership of over 100 million Americans on environmental justice, individual 
and corporate responsibility, and deeper moral commitment to help change 
environmental values. 
<P>Perhaps the time has come now for all religions to consider a new mission - 
that is a mission of restoration and renewal for an ailing earth. It should not 
be too difficult for religious leaders to grasp since most faith considers Earth 
to be a manifestation of the work of God, and that as creatures we have a 
responsibility to ensure that this work is not degraded as a result of our 
careless and irresponsible stewardship. One popular philosopher perhaps best 
summed it up when he said, "The Earth is God's gift to Man; how we treat the 
Earth is Man's gift to God". This was later paraphrased by a student as "The 
Earth is God's gift to Man; how we treat the Earth and each other is Man's gift 
to God." Perhaps religious institutions may indeed wish to look anew at their 
mission to see how far it would include stewardship of the Earth as part of its 
mission. Foundations might serve as an effective catalyst in encouraging the 
development of such mission. 
<P><B>Convening "implementation summits" </B>
<P>One of the most consistent features of the United Nations is its power as 
convenor. For nearly two decades, it has convened a number of conferences which 
have yielded action plans, and Agenda 21 is one such plan of action. 
Unfortunately, the question of implementation as a systematic global effort has 
remained elusive. Perhaps the time has indeed arrived for us to reconsider 
"implementation summits" whereby governments would take time to review some of 
these plans systematically and creatively with a view to determining what are or 
would be required to ensure effective implementation. Foundations could 
contribute significantly to launching such a process by commissioning a 
systematic examination of all action plans from Stockholm to Rio with a view to 
establishing their place on the sustainable agenda and the prospects for 
implementation through collective collaboration and effective strategies. It 
seems ironic that after nearly 20 years of conferencing, few of us have a clear 
idea of the status of implementation of all these plans of action. The Earth 
Summit may therefore provide a catalyst for undertaking this important analysis. 

<P><B>Marketing of Agenda 21 </B>
<P>Agenda 21 suffers from the fact that whereas it has become a popular label, 
it is virtually unknown even among senior government officials in many nations. 
Part of the difficulty here is that there is yet to be published a truly 
readable text and one that engages the mind as well as the attention. Perhaps 
this is where the foundations might make a significant contribution by 
supporting efforts to effectively market Agenda 21. 
<P>Possibilities include more effective utilization of the arts, entertainment 
and advertising. Foundations have traditionally and consistently supported the 
arts.10 Many are committed to making arts and culture an active part of the 
daily lives of people and community, and have invested in a number of programmes 
to that end. Given the fact, however, that art is a universal medium, an 
effective medium for transmitting messages, it is deemed unfortunate that it is 
not more widely utilized in the sustainable development revolution.11 This is 
perhaps an area where foundation giving might consider an additional focus using 
the powerful medium of art to help develop a new sense of caring for the earth 
and the values for a sustainable lifestyle. 
<P>Markets are more than just centers for economic transactions for goods and 
services. Values are also in transaction - and what better place to transmit 
environmental values than in the marketplace where the consumer can indeed exert 
influence if not exercise power. An environmentally responsible consumer may yet 
turn out to be our best guarantor for environmental sustainability, and 
advertising can do much to influence attitudes and change behavior. This was 
explicitly recognized in Chapter 36 of Agenda 21 which urged countries and the 
United Nations system to mobilize their experience in shaping public behavior 
and consumption patterns and making wide use of their methods. Although a number 
of foundations have already supported a wide variety of media and public 
education campaigns, the advertising community have not yet been sufficiently 
mobilized to have the necessary impact in the consumers' sphere. Perhaps under 
foundations' sponsoring, "advertising for sustainability" campaigns could be 
developed. 
<P><B>Education for sustainable development</B> 
<P>Education, public awareness, and training are linked to virtually all areas 
in Agenda 21, especially the ones on meeting basic needs, capacity-building, 
data and information, science, and the role of major groups. As we move into the 
twenty-first century, the need for a basic understanding of how the natural and 
cultural environments are totally interrelated is paramount to our ability to 
maintain a sustainable environment. 
<P>The telecommunications revolution and the "information highway" that has 
resulted have provided unprecedented opportunities. The ability of computers to 
model complex systems, combined with the power of interactive multimedia, can 
bring users a wealth of interrelated information in a format that is at once 
understandable, exciting and engaging. The integration of text, graphics, video, 
audio, still images, and simulations provide a unique and powerful educational 
methodology for interrelating disciplines. 
<P>What is needed is a World Wide Web site that addresses the range and 
complexity of the interrelated nature of all human activities and the 
environment for both policymakers and the general public. This site requires an 
accessible, structured database that can be maintained, updated, and expanded. 
Such a database exists based on twenty-five key topics organized to illustrate 
how the natural and cultural environments are totally interrelated in a 
sustainable world. The Encyclopedia of the Environment published by Houghton 
Mifflin Company for The Rene Dubos Center for Human Environments contains 550 
nontechnical, alphabetically arranged, concise entries, covering critical 
concepts, basic terms, problems, and issues written by over 300 eminent 
scientists, scholars, researchers, policy analysts, and economists for the 
general reader. The entries include succinct definitions, interpretive essays, 
selected biographies, graphs, figures, tables, and maps. In this way the site 
can utilize up-to-date, reliable, nontechnical information that incorporates 
different perspectives on achieving sustainability. 
<P>The prototype for such a website has been initiated with support from the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Exxon Corporation, United Technologies 
Corporation and others. Entitled "EarthLine" it responds to the need for 
balanced perspectives and authoritative information to help individuals 
contribute to the development of positive, effective solutions to environmental 
problems and issues involved with sustainable development. "E2Zone" is a 
corresponding site for young people on EarthLine. There is a wealth of 
specialized information to be found on the World Wide Web. By hyperlinking to 
relevant sites, EarthLine can integrate appropriate materials into interactive 
learning experiences to meet the needs of stakeholders worldwide. Establishing 
and maintaining EarthLine would be an ideal collaborative initiative for the 
Environmental Grantmakers Association (EGA). 
<P><B>Indigenous people: the case for special attention</B>
<P>A number of foundations have already began to address and support indigenous 
peoples, particularly those who are living in critical enviroo attract private 
funds to share the cost of projects. 
<P>There are a number of key areas to which foundation support might give a new 
vitality to this provision. For example, it has been proposed that this should 
be made the Decade of the Indigenous Peoples and yet the world is none the 
wiser. How can foundations assist in promoting the Decade, its objectives, and 
perhaps educating national societies on what their responsibilities might be? It 
has also been proposed that a special unit might be created at United Nations 
for indigenous peoples. This too remains to be addressed.
<P>More importantly, there are a number of outstanding issues which might be 
looked at immediately. One initiative was undertaken by UNEP and the Indigenous 
Development Institute (INDI) at Cambridge University as a model. At the 
initiative of UNEP and under the auspices of Chapter 26 of Agenda 21, the 
Haudenosaunee people were encouraged to review for themselves the critical 
environmental issues that affected their reservations and territories with the 
view to defining a Restoration Strategy for Native Lands. This has produced a 
unique report on the state of the Haudenosaunee environment, the issues which 
call for much more energetic action by the governments and states in which these 
territories are located, and greater recognition and support by the 
international community. A budget for implementing the Haudenosaunee Plan of 
Action has also been produced. Because of the amount of work that has been put 
in so far, foundations could review this program and similar such programs to 
see how they could redirect resources or facilitate the engendering of new 
resources for this purpose. 
<P><B>Risk-taking, innovations and flexibility </B>
<P>Foundations should develop a separate "risk" fund for innovative projects 
that attempt innovative approaches. Many may fail, but the few that succeed will 
provide powerful models for broader implementation.
<P><B>Activating relevant constituencies</B> 
<P>It is being suggested here that far from looking at Agenda 21 abstractly and 
amorphously, it may be useful to take a look at key provisions and identify the 
strategic constituencies that may be most be suitable for propelling the 
implementation process. 
<P>For example, the medical community and health-givers would seem most relevant 
to Chapter 6 (Health and environmental issues). Likewise, for Chapter 28, youth 
organizations might be encouraged to join the process of implementation. We can 
cite, for instance, an outstanding example where, at the initiative of UNEP and 
with the support of a number of U.N. agencies, a small NGO called Peace Child 
International was invited to re-write Agenda 21 in an idiom, language and style 
that is familiar to youth. The result, "Rescue Mission: Planet Earth", remains 
to-date the most popular and perhaps the most readable version of Agenda 21.
<P><B>Consensus-building at national and global levels</B> 
<P>Only in very few countries is there any broad-based consensus in support of 
Agenda 21. Many governments have made commitments and even assumed obligations, 
as for example in the case of climate change and the biodiversity conventions, 
but have been unable to develop implementing policies due to lack of public 
support. Only in a few countries have there been serious national debates on 
Agenda 21. This would be an area where foundations could make a contribution by 
hosting workshops, meetings, or seminars on Agenda 21 with a view to educating 
the public on its meaning and message, and what they could do to engage the 
policy process in terms of implementation.
<P>
<P><B>Cabinet-level briefings</B> 
<P>In the past, there have been some successful attempts to hold cabinet level 
briefings, and similar attempts may be undertaken more systematically under the 
auspices of say, the Commission on Sustainable Development, with the support of 
the foundations to host periodic meetings of cabinet members where top experts 
may be invited to address issues of sustainability and Agenda 21. For example, 
in 1990 a Rockefeller Foundation grant of $100,000 provided the seed money for 
heads of states and ministerial briefings which were held in 22 countries in 
1991 and 1992 and helped significantly to solidify developing countries' support 
for the Climate Change Convention. But the foundation's grant contributed more 
than just financial support, it also provided a kind of cachet which enabled the 
Climate Institute to exert some leverage in lining up other resources for this 
ambitious undertaking. 
<P><B>Toward a new philanthropic diplomacy</B> 
<P>Foundations are now embarking on new areas of promoting bi-national 
cooperation within ecologically designed frameworks where governments will 
otherwise seem to be reluctant. This could prove especially critical in areas 
where neighbors are "enemies" but share a common economic resource whose joint 
exploitation could be mutually beneficial but whose deterioration would deny 
both parties significant benefits. Such initiatives may engender a new 
"Neighbors to Partners" strategy for "environmental sustainability" and could 
reduce tensions in such flashpoint areas as the Nile, the Jordan River and even 
at more moderate levels of tension between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The 
MacArthur Foundation, for example, has developed a number of such initiatives 
and hopefully these could be broadened and encouraged.
<P><B>New partnerships with the United Nations</B> 
<P>It is time to think anew about relationships with the world organization, and 
as we examine the processes of implementing Agenda 21, it is clear that 
governmental efforts alone will never be able to meet the challenges involved 
and that new partnerships are called for. It is being proposed here that the 
Commission on Sustainable Development work out a new relationship with the 
foundation community with a view to jointly defining and approaching specific 
problems.
<P>APPENDIX
<P><B>The Future of Giving: Hopes, Concerns, and Fantasies</B> 
<P>The record of growth in the assets of the foundation community has been 
impressive but there is no assurance that this pattern will obtain in the 
future. Already some observers have been flashing alerts, if not alarms, of a 
somewhat dismal prospect. <B>These include, among other things:</B>
<P><B>The changing status of the family and religion</B> 
<P>Traditionally, the family and religion have been the forces that have shaped 
giving in the U.S. These two institutions are undergoing an important 
transition, however, and there is no guarantee that the values that have infused 
the habit of giving will emerge at the other end of the transition. This in turn 
could be a subject of serious examination in order to determine how giving might 
survive this very worrying developments. 
<P><B>The new billionaires </B>
<P>An interesting trend in the U.S. is the rise of the new billionaires many of 
whom have no historic family ties or deeply-rooted relations to society. Few has 
yet formed a coherent system of environmental values or program for systematic 
giving. This may be a promising area for exploration by foundations - how to 
engage the interest and attention of the new billionaires and the new wealth and 
how to help create a value system which would continue a historic tradition of 
philanthropy.
<P>
<P><B>The second- and third- generation philanthropists </B>
<P>Whether or not the children as successors of the founders of philanthropic 
institutions and great givers of the past will continue the tradition is an area 
which might be addressed by foundations as we look to the future of giving in 
the U.S.
<P>
<P><B>"What-ifs" and "why-nots"</B> 
<P>The end of the Cold War and the forces of globalization, economic 
liberalization, democratization and the explosive electronic communications and 
information revolution as well as the emergence of "virtual communities" have 
created what some have termed as open in history. Now humanity has an 
unprecedented opportunity to re-invent itself - establishing that a future that 
is equitable, prosperous and sustainable. It is a time which calls for bold 
visions, creative thinking, experimentation and innovation, a time to liberate 
humanity's considerable "fantasy resources". It is a time to ask "what if?" and 
"why not?" along the lines advocated by the French students in their revolution 
of the '60s when they urged us to be "realistic and ask the impossible". What if 
foundations could mobilize their collective resources for say five years and 
commit these to the service of the Earth in a clear and coherent strategy for 
the implementation of Agenda 21? Such a question posed in fantasy might yet 
surprise the world with a plain and simple answer, "why not?". 
<P><B>Rekindling the Spirit of Rio </B>
<P>Historians may yet conclude that one of the most significant achievements of 
the United Nations during its fifty years of existence was conceiving and 
convening the Earth Summit. Historians may also characterize it as a defining 
moment for humanity and the planet. Without question, this was a conference of 
great expectations and strong sense of purpose. It was also perhaps a special 
moment for the earth establishing principles for a new covenant for the earth 
based on the realities of the human impact on the natural world and the dangers 
posed for the human future by unsustainable patterns of production, consumption 
and lifestyles. 
<P>Perhaps the former United Nations Secretary-General, Dr. Boutros Boutros 
Ghali, captured the spirit best and the requirements for new forms of good 
citizenship when he said: 
<P>"After loving his neighbor as the bible required him to, post-Rio man must 
also love the world, including the flowers, birds and trees - every part of that 
natural world that we are constantly destroying. 
<P>Over and above the moral contract with God, over and above the social 
contract concluded with men, we must now conclude an ethical and political 
contract with nature, with this earth to which we owe our very existence and 
which gives us life." 
<P><B>He then continued:</B>
<P>"Our road is now illuminated by a new light which I, along with many others, 
have called the spirit of Rio. 
<P>Perhaps, the fifth anniversary of the Earth Summit will provide a unique 
opportunity to rekindle that spirit. And perhaps, just perhaps the U.S. 
foundations might provide the spark.

Environment and Resources Program Supports conservation efforts, public 
education, policy studies, and sustainable development projects relating to key 
environmental issues, with a focus on biodiversity in the tropics.
<P><B>Community Initiatives Program<BR></B>Supports community development and 
cultural activities in Chicago, Illinois and community development, cultural 
activities, and education in Palm Beach County, Florida. Its 3 fundamental goals 
are: enhancing democratic and civic life, developing an inclusive and diverse 
culture, and overcoming obstacles to economic opportunity for those in poverty.
<P><B>Education Program</B>
<P>Supports efforts across the U.S. to encourage family and community 
involvement in children's education, develop critical and thinking skills, 
promote basic literacy and numeracy, and develop new standards and assessments. 
A special initiative supports education reform in Chicago.
<P><B>Foundation-wide initiatives</B>
<P>Through foundation-wide initiatives, the foundation responds to 
broadly-defined problems that call for multidisciplinary analysis and action. 
Initiatives generally encompass 2 or more of the foundation program interests.
<P>General Program Supports research and action on a changing set of important 
issues which do not fall within the guidelines of its topical programs. The 
program makes awards in 3 categories: special initiatives, innovative media 
projects, and other grants. Recent special initiatives have focused on 
international human rights and on youth and public service.
<P>Health Program Supports collaborative research on mental health, particularly 
the biological, behavioral, and social processes underlying both health and 
disease; and research on the biology of parasitic diseases. MacArthur Fellows 
Program Provides no-strings-attached fellowships to exceptionally talented and 
promising individuals.
<P>Population Program Supports creative strategies to address complex population 
and reproductive rights issues. Working in Brazil, Mexico, India and Nigeria, it 
emphasizes initiatives to improve women's reproductive health, to explore the 
parallel phenomena of population growth and natural resource degradation; and to 
use media with local participation to inform people about reproductive health.
<P>Program on Peace and International CooperationSupports efforts to enhance 
prospects for peace and international cooperation through training, research and 
public education. Areas of interest include foreign policy and national 
priorities; arms control, disarmament, and demobilization; international 
governance and civil society; and sustainable democracy. 
<P>Table 5: Annenberg Foundation
<P>Foundation Programme Areas<BR>Brief description Annenberg Foundation
<P><B>Encouraging new school designs</B>
<P>The foundation supports efforts to re-design schools such as the development 
of reform strategies that encompass the whole school, from curriculum and 
instruction to budgeting and community involvement. These new whole-school 
"designs" are intended to reduce the program-oriented, piecemeal approach to 
reform often found in schools and to stimulate significant gains in student 
achievement. 
<P>The New American Schools, which figures prominently among those pursuing this 
new vision for education, has enjoyed the support of the Foundation since its 
inception in 1991. At the center of NAS's work is the creation and development 
of a number of Design Teams, composed of some of America's most creative 
thinkers in education, business, science, and the humanities. While each design 
team is unique, all focus on innovations in school instruction, governance and 
the use of technology.
<P><B>Supporting urban school reform</B> 
<P>The foundation seeks:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>To promote, in some of the nation's most urban and rural areas an 
  unprecedented number of public schools which, in collaboration with their 
  immediate community: 
  <LI>arrange their resources so that each child is known well and then use this 
  knowledge to shape each child's schooling; 
  <LI>set uncompromisingly high academic expectations for all children; 
  <LI>respectfully assess the progress of each student by means of a careful and 
  continuing review of that child's actual work and then use that assessment to 
  improve the child's learning; 
  <LI>exhibit daily the ideals of acting as a democratic and thoughtful learning 
  community. 
  <LI>To unite these changing schools in a diverse array of small "systems of 
  schools" and thereby encourage member schools to learn from and support one 
  another. 
  <LI>To provoke the larger, formal systems - local, county and state - of which 
  these smaller "systems" are a part to provide participating schools with the 
  autonomy, flexibility, resources, and time they need to become genuinely good 
  schools. 
  <LI>To mobilize the local community supports - political, moral, and financial 
  - and the local broad-based coalitions in support of the goals of the urban 
  school reform. 
  <P><B>Promoting genuinely good, genuinely rural schools: The rural 
  challenge</B>
  <P>The foundation encourages rural schools and communities to promote develop 
  a "pedagogy of place" that takes full advantage of their rural qualities and 
  to overcome the isolation and marginalization that characterize so much of 
  rural education.
  <UL>
    <LI>Moving arts education to center stage The foundation seeks to integrate 
    arts education into school reform and promotes learning through the arts as 
    a powerful catalyst for cognitive growth.

  Foundation
  <P><B>Conservation and the Environment
  <P></B>The current program is devoted to basic research on how ecosystems work 
  focusing on botany and terrestrial ecosystems. The Foundation also invests in 
  land preservation through the Trust for Public Land and the Nature Conservancy 
  an area where 31 grants totaling $12,323,700 were made in 1995.
  <P>In selecting both institutions and researchers, the Foundation looks for 
  independence, leadership in the field, vitality in questioning research and 
  its results, and a commitment to objective research aimed at learning and 
  understanding or "the point of view of the mind that delights in understanding 
  nature rather than in attempting to reform her".
  <P>This program has evolved from interests originally stated by its 
  predecessors, the Avalon and Old Dominion Foundations as including the 
  preservation of natural areas and the support of "organizations concerned with 
  increasing man's understanding of his natural environment, his relation to it, 
  and the affects of activities upon it." Through the early 1970's, a 
  substantial fraction of the grants supported land acquisition. Between 1974 
  and 1979, it supported research in energy, natural resources, and the 
  environment including the oceans, and of important acquisition working in 
  these fields. It also supported the training of young scientists, engineers, 
  resource managers, and potential policy makers.
  <P><B>Limitation:</B> The Conservation and the Environment Programme does not 
  support advocacy, nor does it make grants for work in such areas as energy, 
  global warming, biodiversity, sustainability, wildlife, land management, 
  agriculture, pollution or related policy.
  <P><B>Higher Education and Scholarship</B>
  <P>The field of higher education and scholarship has been central to the work 
  of the Foundation over the years. Focus is on strengthening doctoral education 
  in the arts and sciences; portable fellowships for outstanding graduate 
  students in the humanities; sponsoring of a series of graduate seminars in 
  literature and history.
  <P><B>Population</B>
  <P>The Foundation's efforts are directed to increased support of applied 
  research in contraceptive development; more emphasis on advancing on advancing 
  the understanding of human behavior.
  <P><B>Literacy</B> 
  <P>The goal has been not only to improve children's educational skills but to 
  help students become actively literate across a broad array of intellectual 
  competencies. To pursue this goal, the Foundation's program attempted to 
  capitalize on the findings of basic research about the learning processes that 
  have emerged in the cognitive sciences over the past 20 years, especially as 
  they might be applied to the educational needs of disadvantaged students.

    <P>The program aims to explore key strategies by which the basic building 
    blocks indispensable to science-based development - human capital and the 
    institutional end environmental settings required for it to be productively 
    deployed - can be strengthened. These initiatives that cross the traditional 
    boundaries of the global environment, agriculture, health, and population 
    divisions. The major focus is on innovative approaches that can: (1) 
    increase the participation of girls in primary and secondary education; and 
    (2) enhance training and career maintenance arrangements for leadership in 
    scientific and economic research and science policy-making. The program also 
    supports activities to promote children's technological literacy and the 
    popularization of science more generally.
    <P><B>Arts and Humanities The programs' 2 primary interests are:</B>
    <P>
    <OL>
      <LI>To extend international and intercultural understanding - by 
      supporting scholars who are seeking to enrich this country's understanding 
      of Third World cultures, of cultural pluralism within the United States, 
      and of the changing social, cultural, and environmental circumstances of 
      contemporary peoples. 
      <P></P>
      <LI>To increase artistic experimentation across cultural boundaries - by 
      encouraging artists to create works across cultures, and within the United 
      States, across neighborhood boundaries. Grants are also made for original 
      artistic experiments involving the interplay of diverse cultural forms and 
      meanings.

    urban poor. Funding is provided for stimulating and informing community 
    planning and action, building new understanding of persistent poverty, and 
    strengthening basic skills. 
    <P>In the area of School Reform, the foundation is assisting a limited 
    number of programs to improve public education in poor communities for 
    at-risk children and help these young people succeed in school. A key goal 
    for this effort is to hasten the widespread adoption of methods pioneered by 
    Dr. James P. Comer, that stress the importance of a child's psychological 
    preparation for school, and emphasize the importance of school staff and 
    parents in the child's academic and social development. Support is also 
    provided for a national network of school systems to improve teaching and 
    learning in the arts and humanities, as a means to promote intercultural and 
    international understanding. In addition, the foundation supports a 
    multi-site demonstration developing and evaluating alternative methods. 
    <P><B>International Security</B>
