      <H3>Water Quality Conditions in the United States: A Profile from the 1998 
      National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress</H3>
      <P><EM>States, tribes, territories and interstate commissions report that, 
      in 1998, about 40% of U.S. streams, lakes and estuaries that were assessed 
      were not clean enough to support uses such as fishing and swimming. About 
      32% of U.S. waters were assessed for this national inventory of water 
      quality. Leading pollutants in impaired waters include siltation, 
      bacteria, nutrients and metals. Runoff from agricultural lands and urban 
      areas are the primary sources of these pollutants. Although the U.S. has 
      made significant progress in cleaning up polluted waters over the past 30 
      years, much remains to be done to restore and protect</EM> <EM>the 
      Nation's waters.</EM>
      <CENTER></CENTER>
      <P><STRONG>Findings</STRONG> 
      <P>Recent water quality data finds that more than 291,000 miles of 
      assessed rivers and streams do not meet water quality standards. Across 
      all types of waterbodies, states, territories, tribes and other 
      jurisdictions report that poor water quality affects aquatic life, fish 
      consumption, swimming, and drinking water. In their 1998 reports, states 
      assessed 840,000 miles of rivers and 17.4 million acres of lakes, 
      including 150,000 more river miles and 600,000 more lake acres than in 
      their previous reports in 1996.

      <P>Of the assessed ocean shoreline miles, 12% are impaired, primarily 
      because of bacteria, turbidity and excess nutrients. Primary sources of 
      pollution include urban runoff, storm sewers and land disposal of wastes. 
      States assessed only 5% of the Nation's ocean shoreline miles. 
      <P>States also found that 96% of assessed Great Lakes shoreline miles are 
      impaired, primarily due to pollutants in fish tissue at levels that exceed 
      standards to protect human health. States assessed 90% of Great Lakes 
      shoreline miles.

      <P>Wetlands are being lost in the United States at a rate of about 100,000 
      acres per year in the contiguous United States. Eleven states and tribes 
      listed sources of recent wetland loss; conversion for agricultural uses, 
      road construction, and residential development are leading reasons for 
      loss. 
      <P>The states found that ground water quality is good and can support many 
      different uses. However, measurable negative impacts have been detected 
      and are commonly traced back to sources such as leaking underground 
      storage tanks, septic systems, and landfills. 
      <P><STRONG>Reporting Under the Clean Water Act</STRONG> 
      <P>This <EM>National Water Quality Inventory </EM>is the twelfth biennial 
      report to Congress prepared under Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act. 
      It contains information from each state on the quality of our nation's 
      rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, coastal waters, and ground water, 
      along with information on public health and aquatic life concerns. It 
      serves as a snapshot of water quality conditions across the country. 
      <P>To assess water quality, states and other jurisdictions compare their 
      monitoring results to the water quality standards they have set for their 
      waters. These standards consist of designated uses (such as drinking, 
      swimming, or fishing), criteria to protect those uses (such as 
      chemical-specific thresholds that should not be exceeded), and an 
      antidegradation policy intended to keep waters that do meet standards from 
      deteriorating from their current condition. 
      <P>Under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, there is a second 
      reporting requirement -- that states provide lists of all of their 
      impaired waters. These lists are then used to prioritize state restoration 
      activities. This is accomplished through the development of Total Maximum 
      Daily Loads (TMDLs), calculations of the amount of a pollutant that a 
      waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. A TMDL is 
      the sum of all allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing 
      point and nonpoint sources. It includes reductions needed to meet water 
      quality standards and allocates those reductions among sources in the 
      watershed. 
      <P>Information reported by the states under the two Clean Water Act 
      reporting requirements is generally consistent, although the 303(d) lists 
      often include specific information from more targeted monitoring 
      activities. This information clearly points to the need to restore 
      polluted waters and maintain the quality of waters that currently meet 
      standards. In August 1999, EPA announced a new proposal for a strengthened 
      TMDL program. Since August, EPA has worked to incorporate comments from 
      stakeholders and to refine the proposal to be an effective, common-sense 
      approach to water restoration led by states, territories, and tribes in 
      partnership with federal and local governments, and local communities.
