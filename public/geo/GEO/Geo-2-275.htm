<p class=HeadingA><span style='font-variant:normal;text-transform:uppercase'>The
Political Foundations of Sustainable Development<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>Structural
adjustment evolved from a package of national-level economic reforms to an
instrument of global economic policy over the past decade and one-half. Predating,
then running parallel to, the evolution of structural adjustment was the
emergence of sustainability as the new development paradigm. However, whereas
structural adjustment was driven and shaped by the very centers of
international economic power, sustainable development has emerged from public
pressure, ultimately forcing itself onto the agenda of governments and
international institutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Two international events mark
the evolution of sustainable development over the past three decades, the
Stockholm conference of 1972 and the Rio conference of 1992. Those two
conferences are significant not because they represent radical departures from
politics of the past or because governments fundamentally altered their
policies thereafter. Rather, they acquire significance because they represent
the formal institutional result of the public’s demand that governments address
the growing environmental crises. In this sense, the two conferences are the
culmination of prior periods of international environmental struggles while
also marking the beginning of new periods of political activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>The Stockholm Conference</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>In
this perspective, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held
in Stockholm in 1972 acquired significance in that it reflected the mounting
public distress in northern societies about the negative impacts of
industrialization. In no uncertain terms, the Stockholm conference was driven
by citizens in industrialized countries who were increasingly preoccupied with
the cumulative impacts of stationary and mobile pollution. Prognostications of
a planet rendered uninhabitable by industrial expansion were compounded by
neo-Malthusian prophecies of population explosion in the developing world. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Silent Spring</i> (1962),</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>1</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Population
Bomb</i> (1970),</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>2</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Limits to Growth</i> (1972)</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>3</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> captured the general anxieties of the public in
industrialized countries by expressing doomsday scenarios caused by a shrinking
resource base, spreading pollution, and ever-expanding populations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>In many ways, the preparatory
process for the Stockholm conference became a dress rehearsal for subsequent
struggles between the industrialized North and developing countries of the
South that continue to the present day. As conference organizers began seeking
a consensual framework among the 113 participating nations, the environmental
agenda of the industrialized societies collided head-on with the political
perspectives and priorities of the developing world.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>4</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> In contrast to industrialization problems of the
North, developing countries identified the issue of poverty alleviation as
their most urgent challenge to arresting environmental degradation. They
highlighted the relation between impoverishment and the degradation of natural
resources through soil erosion, deforestation, desertification, and diminishing
water sources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>A tenuous compromise between
the two perspectives was forged at the Preparatory Committee meeting held in
Founex, Switzerland, in June 1971. One of the important concessions underlying
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Founex Report</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>5</span></sup></i><span
style='color:windowtext'> and the subsequent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Stockholm Declaration</i></span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>6</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> was acceptance of the developing countries’
perspective that pollution caused by industrialization in the North imposed
tangible constraints on their own development and industrialization options. A
second important concession was acceptance of the South’s view that poverty,
not industrialization, was the overriding cause of environmental problems in
the developing world for which economic growth would have to provide the
principal answer. Moreover, their insistence on placing national sovereignty at
the center of this compromise underscored developing countries’ resistance to
using future international environmental agreements to alter their own
development paths, reduce development assistance, or condition financial transfers
from the North.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>7</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The formal statement of the
conference, known as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stockholm
Declaration</i>, established 26 principles of behavior and responsibility that
were intended to serve as the basis for future legally binding multilateral
agreements. The accompanying Action Plan for the Human Environment enumerated
109 recommendations in three areas: environmental assessment, environmental
management, and supporting institutional measures. Implementation of those
actions was intended to lay the institutional and legal foundation for global
environmental monitoring and management. The conference also gave rise to the
formation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) through a
resolution of the UN General Assembly in 1972. The new agency was initially
intended to coordinate environmental actions for the entire UN development
system and to fund specific environmental programs of a global nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>If the Stockholm conference
were measured by its success in implementing the principles or recommended
actions, it would be deemed a categoric failure. The principles have not become
the basis of international law, the 109 recommendations have largely been
overlooked, and UNEP has never acquired the functional status of being the UN
agency responsible for coordinating the system’s environmental activities.
Indeed, UNEP has struggled consistently to gain comparable stature to the other
agencies of the UN development system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Rather, the significance of
the Stockholm conference resides in its successfully crystalizing the
underlying issues of global environmental politics leading up to 1972. The
conference provided a forum for articulating the different agendas of the
industrialized North and those of the developing countries, and it facilitated
the forging of a compromise, albeit a fragile one, as the basis for future
international environmental actions and accords.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB>Sharpening Global Environmental Tensions</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>In the
subsequent 20 years, the evolution of the conceptual foundations of sustainable
development was driven by the same two political forces that shaped the
Stockholm conference—that is, public pressures exerted by a diverse but growing
environmental movement and by tensions between North and South. The
public-driven environmental movement was spurred by a multiplicity of
environmental crises. Among them were localized disasters, such as the mass
chemical contamination in Bhopal, India, and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in
the Ukraine. Some environmental crises spread across regions of the world, such
as acidification in the United States and Northern Europe and destruction of
tropical rain forests in Brazil, Asia, and central Africa. Other environmental
problems acquired global proportions, such as stratospheric ozone depletion and
greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. Public clamor for government
action spawned a host of new international environmental conventions,</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>8</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> obliged multi- and bilateral development agencies to
adopt new standards of behavior, and created new international financial
incentives.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>9</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The development cum
environment agenda of the South, accepted as a matter of formality at Founex
and Stockholm, fared less well in the real world politics of North-South power
relations in the post-Stockholm period. The South’s view on how to address its
pressing development needs was captured in its demands for a New International
Economic Order (NIEO). Dating back to the first United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development meeting in 1964, followed by the Algiers Conference of
the Non-Aligned Countries in 1973, the NIEO was formulated in 1974 at a special
session of the UN General Assembly.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>10</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Premised on the assumption that the developing
countries held considerable bargaining power over the North’s access to oil and
other basic commodities, the nonaligned countries felt they could force
fundamental changes in North-South relations, including expanded trade
opportunities, increased capital flows, accelerated technology transfer, even
strengthened North-to-South income redistribution. The underlying objective of
the developing countries in promoting the NIEO was to ensure their “national
economic sovereignty” vis-à-vis the industrial powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>This precedent-setting show of
solidarity among fundamentally different developing countries collapsed without
ceremony at the 1981 Cancun Summit when the leading industrial countries
refused to give further consideration to their demands. Collapse of the NIEO
was attributable in large part to sharply deteriorating economic conditions in
scores of developing countries. The hard-earned Third World solidarity of the
1970s dissipated quickly as developing countries competed with each other to
gain access to the limited, and urgently needed, capital resources of the
industrialized societies.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>11</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'> One of
the few meaningful accomplishments of this North-South dialogue in the
post-Stockholm period was the agreement reached between European countries and
their 69 former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (the ACP
countries). The Lomé Convention, renewed through four consecutive negotiations,
established preferential trade relations between the European Community and ACP
countries, guaranteed agreed levels of development assistance, and promoted a
wide range of social and human rights issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB style='margin-bottom:11.5pt'>First Articulations of Sustainable
Development</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>These
two international pressures, growing public demand and conflicting North-South
development perspectives, found their way, albeit unevenly, into two seminal
formulations of sustainable development in the 1980s. The first statement was
proffered in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>World Conservation
Strategy</i> (WCS), published by the International Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), UNEP, and the World Wide Fund for
Nature-International (WWF-I) in 1980.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>12</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> The WCS marked a significant departure from previous
approaches to the development-environment nexus in that it sought to establish
a “global framework for conservation” and affirmed the compatibility of
promoting development objectives while “achieving conservation.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>13</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> The WCS offered the first exposition of
sustainability that effectively linked human welfare, now and in the future, to
sustainable management of the planet’s natural patrimony. The strategy set
forth a carefully organized menu of requirements and action priorities for national
governments that would help guide them in using their natural resource bases to
promote human welfare while respecting the “carrying capacities of ecosystems.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>14</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext style='margin-top:1.0pt'><span style='color:windowtext'>The
major failing of the WCS was that this ethically grounded, morally persuasive
statement disregarded the political realities of the North-South divide. The
moral high ground established by the WCS was undermined by its political
naiveté and inability to come to grips with the international political
economy. As a consequence, the WCS was received as a compelling if somewhat
visionary statement, but one that failed to mobilize international political
support and consequently proved unable to generate enduring practical and
programmatic influence. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext style='margin-top:1.0pt'><span style='color:windowtext'>The
WCS, as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Founex Report</i> before it,
did provide a strengthened conceptual foundation for the next articulation of
sustainable development offered by the World Commission on Environment and
Development (WCED), also known as the Brundtland Commission, in its 1987
report, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Our Common Future</i>.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>15</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> The Brundtland Commission’s contributions to
establishing sustainable development as the standard for international
development were threefold. First, the WCED effectively established the present
generation’s responsibility for safeguarding future generations’ development
options and opportunities by protecting the planet’s environment and natural
resources. Second, it placed the alleviation of poverty in developing countries
as the central axis around which global sustainability would revolve. Third, it
recast the pursuit of sustainability in the context of the international
economy by recognizing the need to reorder patterns of international trade and
flows of capital and to ensure greater developing world influence in these
economic relations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The biggest weakness of the
Brundtland Commission report lay not in its analytical contributions but in its
prescriptions. Its highly ambiguous proposals sent the message to governments
and development agencies alike that “growth as usual” policies would remain the
linchpin for promoting sustainable development practices. In this regard, the
commission asserted that a 3-4 percent growth rate in the industrialized
nations was the pivotal economic requirement on which poverty alleviation in
the developing world depended.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>16</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> In turn, the WCED called for the world economy to
expand “by a factor of five or ten,” ultimately translating into an annual per
capita income rise of 3 percent in all countries, North and South. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The WCED also called for
“changing the quality of growth,” and it recognized the need to redistribute
wealth in order to alleviate poverty. However, those potentially radical
propositions were diluted by its overall message that the transition to a
sustainable world would not require fundamental changes in the current
distribution of wealth, consumption patterns, standards of living, or the
character of growth in the North and South. Further, the WCED did not offer an
accurate or complete portrayal of the political relations and struggles,
international and national, that needed to be addressed in order to move the
world society to a sustainable development path. However, where the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>World Conservation Strategy</i> had failed,
the Brundtland Commission achieved remarkable success in establishing
sustainable development as the standard against which the behavior of
governments and international institutions would measure their policies and
activities. Moreover, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Our Common Future</i>
cemented the conceptual and political foundation on which the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), the Rio conference, was to
be erected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB>The Rio Conference</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>The
formal accomplishments of UNCED, held in 1992 and also known as the Earth
Summit, were, in some ways, considerable. Global conventions on climate change
and biodiversity were signed; the “Earth Charter,” a set of principles to be
respected by governments and people, was agreed upon by 178 governments; an
action program to promote sustainability, called Agenda 21, was adopted; and an
institutional mechanism within the UN system, notably the Commission on
Sustainable Development (CSD), was created. To this list can be added the fact
that the Earth Summit was the culmination of a protracted and intense period of
awareness raising among policymakers at the highest level.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>17</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>UNCED can be viewed as the
moment when the international community formally embraced the concept of
sustainable development as the standard for measuring development objectives
and performance in both the North and South. Reflecting a southern perspective,
the UNCED approach attempted to emphasize basic development needs within a
framework that included environmental issues. However, the conceptual framework
of sustainable development emerging from UNCED, while giving greater attention
to changing North-South economic relations, ultimately did not alter the basic
“growth as usual” prescription articulated a few years earlier by the
Brundtland Commission. This attitude was particularly evident in the approach
promoted by northern countries that posited “growth as usual” and technological
innovations as the strategic pillars of sustainable development.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>As with the Stockholm
conference, the Earth Summit did not fundamentally alter the current
development approach; nor did it significantly enhance the political conditions
required to shift the world to a sustainable development path. International
economic incentives remained virtually intact,</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>18</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> power relations between North and South were
unaffected, and economic disparities continued to grow.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>19</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> The Earth Summit assuaged the domestic political
concerns of leaders vis-à-vis their respective publics while leaving basic
economic and social relations unaffected. In short, UNCED produced ample verbal
agreement but postponed for the indefinite future the actual making of
commitments and the undertaking of structural reforms required to promote
sustainable development.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Another significant
shortcoming of UNCED influenced the international development agenda in the
years that followed. Although UNCED proclaimed to have forged the vital linkage
between the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development,
it significantly downplayed the third pillar of sustainability, namely, the
social dimension. That neglect fueled the convocation of successive international
summits under the mantle of the United Nations to reaffirm the rightful place
of such concerns on policymakers’ agendas. Those summits began in 1994 with the
Summit on Human Rights in Vienna, followed in quick order by the Population
Summit in Cairo in 1994, the Social Summit in Copenhagen and the Women’s Summit
in Beijing in 1995, and the Habitat II Summit in 1996. Given UNCED’s relative
lack of attention to social issues, it is not surprising that the official
declarations agreed upon during those successive international conferences
focusing on social issues give scant attention to the central role of the
environment in supporting all aspects of the human enterprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>One final historical note is
in order. Although the evolution of sustainable development as the new
development paradigm has been driven by public pressure and the North-South
political struggle, the conceptual foundations of sustainability have been
enriched over the past two decades by contributions of a new intellectual
order. The hallmark of that intellectual effort is the breaking down of rigid
disciplinary boundaries that have separated the natural and social sciences.
The works of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, K. William Kapp, Kenneth Boulding, and
Herman Daly, among many, have posed fundamental challenges to the postwar
development enterprise in two fundamental areas.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>20</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> First, these scholars assert the intractable physical
constraints that the natural environment imposes on the prevailing economic
growth paradigm, which is predicated on unlimited resources and unrestricted
environmental sink functions. Second, they explore the implications of those
constraints by challenging the basic assumptions of trickle-down economics and
the perspective that growing poverty can be addressed without a global
redistribution of wealth. These authors’ challenges to mainstream development
thinking have yet to be answered, if even accepted, by policymakers on national
and international levels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB>Toward an Operational Definition</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>These
political forces and international struggles have shaped the definition of
sustainable development used in this study. In general terms, the definition is
based on the framework set forth in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Caring
for the Earth</i>, a joint publication of the IUCN, UNEP, and WWF-I.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>21</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Sustainable development is people centered in that
its aim is to improve the quality of human life, and it is conservation based
in that it is conditioned by the need to respect nature’s capacity to provide
resources and life-supporting services. In this perspective, sustainable
development means improving the quality of human life while living within the
carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems.</span><sup><span style='font-size:
5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>22</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>This definition of sustainable
development is a normative concept that embodies standards of judgment and
behavior to be respected as the human community seeks to satisfy its needs of
survival and well-being. The definition embraces the three basic components—the
economic, the social, and the environmental—that constitute the foundations of
sustainable development. These components are intimately interdependent and
consequently require that efforts to promote development support all three of
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The economic component of
sustainability requires that societies pursue economic growth paths that
generate an increase in true income, not short-term policies that lead to
long-term impoverishment. It further requires that societies generate an
optimal flow of income while maintaining their basic stock of capital. Capital,
in this context, includes man-made capital, human capital, and natural capital.
To avoid unrealistic and even self-defeating growth strategies, sustainable
economics requires identifying where man-made capital, human capital, and
natural capital are substitutable and where they remain complementary.
Sustainable economics requires a differentiated approach to growth in that many
developing areas of the world urgently need to increase their productive
capacity, and at the same time and with equal urgency, the industrialized
societies need to reduce their consumption of natural resources and use those
resources more efficiently.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>23</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'>
Economic sustainability also requires internalizing all costs, including the
societal and environmental costs associated with the production and disposition
of goods, thereby implementing the full cost principle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The social dimension of
sustainable development is built on the premise that equity and an
understanding of the human community’s interdependence are basic requirements
of an acceptable quality of life, which is, ultimately, the aim of development.
For a development path to be sustainable over a long period, wealth, resources,
and opportunity must be shared in such a manner that all citizens have access
to minimum standards of security, human rights, and social benefits, such as
food, health, education, shelter, and opportunities for self-development.
Social equity means ensuring that all people have access to education and the
opportunity to make productive, justly remunerated contributions to society.
Interdependence of the human community implies an understanding that stark
social inequities threaten the stability and long-term viability of the human
enterprise. Interdependence also implies recognition that the human community’s
standard of living is ultimately related to the size of the human population to
be sustained by the planet’s environmental resources and infrastructure.
Moreover, the social dimension of sustainable development demands the active
political participation of all social sectors and the accountability of
governments to the broader public in making basic social policy regarding,
among other issues, social equity and population size. It requires drawing on
local populations’ knowledge and experience and strengthening social groups’
capacity to shape and manage their own lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The environmental dimension of
sustainable development is predicated on maintaining the long-term integrity
and therefore productivity of the planet’s life-support systems and
environmental infrastructure. Meeting this standard requires investing in the biosphere’s
infrastructure to ensure the continuity and quality of environmental goods and
services on which all life depends. Environmental sustainability requires the
use of environmental goods in such a way as not to diminish the productivity of
nature or the overall contribution of environmental goods and services to human
well-being. Application of the precautionary principle should become an
integral feature of all development programs to ensure that these activities do
not result in either human harm or ecological irreversibilities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>These three components of
sustainable development should converge in such a way as to generate a steady
stream of income, ensure social equity, pursue socially agreed upon population
levels, maintain man-made and natural capital stocks, and protect the
life-giving services of the environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB>Reforming National Development Strategies</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>Achieving
sustainability will require behavioral changes on all levels of the human
enterprise, from international relations down to community-level development
activities. While recognizing the interrelations of the global, national, and
local levels, the focus of this study is primarily on the requirements of
promoting sustainable development policies at the national and international
levels. The empirical analysis and scenario-building presented in Part Two
focus primarily on the policies and practices of individual nations for the
main reason that the nation-state remains the basic, yet clearly not the
exclusive, unit of decision-making, standard-setting, and public
administration. Although the emerging international economic regime is swiftly
eroding the state’s sphere of influence, it is on the national level that basic
development strategies are formulated and implemented and, in that context,
that basic choices are made regarding human welfare and natural resource
management. It is also on the national level that correcting unsustainable
policies and practices is most urgently needed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Consistent with the definition
of sustainable development offered above, correcting deficient national
development strategies requires addressing the three pillars of
sustainability—that is, the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Far
from inclusive, the elements listed below constitute some of the more important
requisites for shifting to national sustainability strategies in the context of
the rapidly changing world order. This list is tailored to developing
countries, including the nine covered in this research project. Transition to
sustainable development strategies in the industrialized world is equally
urgent, but the specific reforms required to make that transition differ from
the points listed below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=HeadingB>Changing International Development Patterns</p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>If
proposed reforms for promoting sustainable development were to focus
exclusively on the national level, they would ignore the basic trends of
integration and globalization that characterize the emerging international
economy. Those trends endow private capital and the international marketplace
with far greater influence in shaping national development processes while
national governments watch their own influence decline proportionately. The
driving force behind agreement on recent regional and global trade regimes is
the compelling argument that the gateway to world prosperity is expanded trade
and easier access to markets.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>24</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Although economic growth generated by the globalized
world economy will continue to provide economic benefits for some social
sectors, those benefits are not and will not be accessible equitably to all
sectors or all countries. Nor will those benefits necessarily accrue to future
generations. What is certain is that in order to ensure the transition to
sustainability on a global level, three additional changes in the human
enterprise, addressed briefly below, are urgently required.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The first reform is a
fundamental change in the intensity of use of environmental goods and services
on a global level. International debate on this issue was initially enjoined
when the Club of Rome released the results of a global modeling exercise in 1972.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>25</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Limits to
Growth</i> examined the long-term prospects for the human enterprise in
consideration of disturbing trends in industrialization, environmental
deterioration, depletion of nonrenewable resources, human population growth,
and expanding poverty. The 20 years since its publication have demonstrated
that exhaustion of many energy and mineral resources has not become the main
environmental constraint challenging the short-term viability of the human
enterprise. Rather, the major environmental constraints are the limited
absorptive capacity of environmental sinks, the depletion and degradation of
soil productivity, and the consumption of both renewable and nonrenewable
resources at unprecedented rates. These and other factors have converged to
erode the very conditions required for economic production and human survival.
Lack of clean water, fresh air, and uncontaminated, nondepleted soils have combined
with growing population pressures to generate deteriorating standards of living
and societal instability in virtually all countries and regions of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The principal response of
policymakers to those growing constraints has been to look to resource
substitution and technological innovation as ways of forestalling potential
dislocations caused by such constraints.</span><sup><span style='font-size:
5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>26</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> In relying on technological changes and substitution
of resources, policymakers obviate the need to undertake fundamental
alterations in the prevailing economic growth model. Without undervaluing the
significant contributions brought by technological innovation in recent years,
the planet’s weakening environmental infrastructure, the accelerating
consumption of environmental goods and services, and the ever-growing pollution
demand a revisit to the premise of limitless growth underlying the current
economic growth strategy. A sustainable development strategy would replace the
current unlimited growth framework with a world moving toward individual
societies’ and the community of nations’ making basic choices about the scale
and quality of economic growth, the level of human population, and the
distribution of wealth and resources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The second level on which
sustainable development demands fundamental change regards establishing
equitable relations between northern societies and the developing societies of
the South. This relationship is currently characterized by stark disparities in
the distribution of wealth, as reflected, for example, in the fact that the 23
high-income countries have a combined GNP of more than US$18.3 trillion but the
combined income of more than 160 developing countries is approximately US$4.7
trillion.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>27</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'> The per capita
income of the 23 high-income countries averaged US$22,160 in 1992; yet 1.3
billion people live in absolute poverty, and over 3.1 billion had yearly
incomes of less than US$310.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>28</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Accompanying the inequitable distribution of wealth
is the skewed resource consumption between North and South wherein, for
example, the average northerner uses 5,101 kilograms of oil (or energy
equivalent) per year and a southern counterpart in low-income countries
consumes just 338 kilograms per year.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>29</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Moreover, barely one-fifth of the world’s population
consumes 70 percent of all energy, 80 percent of its wood products, and 75
percent of all metals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Quantitative comparisons
provide useful indications of the levels of inequality between North and South.
Alone, however, quantitative analysis does not capture the full band of
disparities between these two parts of the world in that they do not reflect,
among other points, differences in their (in)ability to influence the world’s
economic and political affairs. This point is poignantly reflected in the fact
that by the year 2000, the developing world will contribute more than 50
percent of the world’s annual output.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>30</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Yet the present distribution of wealth and
international economic decisionmaking arrangements in no way reflect the
South’s growing economic contribution or its urgent economic and social needs.
A fundamental shift in the distribution of resources and opportunity from the
North to the South is required to address the growing disparities and the
growing sources of social instability.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>31</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The third fundamental change
regards addressing the intensified pressures that growing populations are
placing on their countries’ natural resources and productive capacities.
Population growth rates of up to 3 percent per year simply exceed the economic
growth rates of many countries, condemning the growing populations to declining
standards of living. Confronted with this reality, a far more comprehensive
effort is required to empower women to control their own lives and profit from
educational and health services, productive resources, and opportunities. In
addition, countries must move to implement adaptive strategies to avoid
overtaxing the productive capacity of agricultural lands and other
consequences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Neither operational mechanisms
nor the political will to create such mechanisms for promoting sustainability
on a global level exists today. In fact, the evolving economic system, current
development strategy, and ideology have consistently generated outcomes that
run contrary to these three requisites of sustainable development. Little hope
can be taken from the somewhat cynical response that it may be necessary to
wait until the impacts of the current development strategy, including more
severe environmental degradation, untenable social inequalities, and
demographic crowding, are dramatically manifested before an ecological
restructuring of our economic system finds a more attentive public audience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext style='text-indent:0in'><span style='color:windowtext'>One
further linkage between sustainable development and structural adjustment must
be identified. Here the conceptual and strategic statements of the World Bank
are important because that institution has played and continues to play a
central role in shaping, implementing, and coordinating the adjustment process
in scores of developing countries. As pointed out in the preceding chapter, the
basic contours and characteristics of adjustment programs were dictated
primarily by the requirements of capital accumulation on a global scale during
this historical period. However, depending on the capacity of national
governments, the Bretton Woods institutions have played a major role in shaping
the way in which countries have responded to the evolving world economy. Thus
their publications are used here to reflect the role of sustainable development
in restructuring national economies in response to the new demands and
opportunities of the evolving world economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>From their initial design to
the present, structural adjustment programs have had no pretense or specific
aim of encouraging sustainable development reforms on an international level.
For example, they had no intention of strengthening the biosphere’s
sustainability, reducing natural resource consumption levels, enhancing the
global sink function performance, or rebuilding the planet’s environmental
infrastructure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The purpose of adjustment
programs, moreover, has not been to address the disparity between North and
South. Economic restructuring programs have not sought to change basic patterns
of consumption or use of natural resources by the industrialized and developing
countries. Designers of adjustment programs did not set goals to alter terms of
trade between North and South or change the conditions under which developing
countries would have access to the northern markets. Nor was there any
intention to redistribute productive assets or wealth from the rich to poor
nations through the economic restructuring programs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>In no uncertain terms,
sponsors and designers of adjustment programs intended only to effect reforms
on the level of national economies. This single-minded purpose is clearly set
forth in the World Bank’s Operational Manual Statement of 1982: “Structural
Adjustment Lending (SAL) is non-project lending to support programs of policy
and institutional change necessary to modify the structure of an economy so
that it can maintain both its growth rate and the viability of its balance of
payments in the medium term.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>32</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>A high degree of consistency
and continuity is apparent in the Bank’s formulations if one traces objectives
of structural adjustment beginning with this formal statement and continuing
through the following 15 years. This consistency is reflected in the initial
justifications of policy-based lending, subsequent policy iterations, and the
Bank’s evaluations. In short, adjustment lending sought “to support policy
changes for short-term stabilization and longer-term growth. It thus supports
policies to bring domestic demand into line with resource availability and
policies to increase economic efficiency and flexibility.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>33</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>Over the course of those
years, the Bank has nuanced its basic objectives of adjustment lending in two
ways. The first was to add “sustained” or “sustainable” as a qualifier to the
growth objective. This change occurred in the early 1990s with the release of a
World Bank evaluation of adjustment programs, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Adjustment Lending Policies for Sustainable Growth</i>.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>34</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Not only did “sustainable growth” find its way into
the title of that publication, but sustainability references surfaced in many
expressions, including “sustained adjustment,”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>35</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> “sustainable reductions in the public sector
deficit,”</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>36</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'> and
“sustainability of the balance of payments situation.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>37</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> However, the references did not establish a direct
conceptual linkage to the framework of sustainable development that evolved
during the 1980s and that was formally agreed upon by governments at UNCED in
June 1992.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>In 1992, the World Bank
injected a second nuance into its structural adjustment lending objectives
statement. As stated in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Third Report on
Adjustment Lending</i>, adjustment policies are designed to “shift an economy
to a new, sustainable and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poverty-reducing</i>
growth path” (emphasis added).</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>38</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> By the 1990s, it was apparent that the public’s
protests regarding structural adjustment’s negative impacts on the most
vulnerable sectors of adjusting societies were not going to disappear. Not only
were these problems enduring in character; their negative impacts threatened
the viability of the economic reform programs and social cohesion, particularly
in low-income countries. Faced with growing public discontent and its admitted
difficulties in alleviating poverty, senior management again elevated poverty
reduction to the level of the Bank’s primary objective.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>39</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> Subsequent Bank strategy and publications, including
those dealing with structural adjustment, have reflected that new clarity of
purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Bodytext><span style='color:windowtext'>The Bretton Woods institutions
(BWI) have responded to the social dimensions of adjustment policies,</span><sup><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>40</span></sup><span
style='color:windowtext'> they recognize the political dimension of
policy-based lending,</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>41</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'> and
they accept the mixed impacts of adjustment lending on the environment of
adjusting countries.</span><sup><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>42</span></sup><span style='color:windowtext'>
Recognition of these impacts, however, has not led the World Bank to alter the
definition of the objectives of its policy-based lending programs. From the
outset of these programs some 15 years ago, the Bank has viewed any improvement
in developing countries’ social, political, and environmental fabric as
contingent on improving a country’s macroeconomic performance. The underlying
BWI approach to adjustment lending is that restoring aggregate growth in
adjusting countries is the sine qua non of addressing the social, political,
and environmental problems besetting adjusting countries. In this framework,
raising countries to a “higher growth path” will provide more resources for
alleviating poverty, providing social services, strengthening management of
natural resources, supporting redistribution policies, and so on. The accuracy
of these assumptions are examined in light of the nine country research
programs presented in Chapters 3 through 11. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
