<P>A leading U-S agricultural scientist is urging the world's farmers, 
agribusiness firms and farm policy makers to reduce the worldwide use of 
agricultural chemicals and adopt new, biologically-based strategies in the 
age-old war on crop pests. VOA's Rob Sivak reports the plea comes in a new book 
that's NOT available at your local bookstore:
<P>The call for a new battle plan in the global war on bugs comes in Pest 
Management at the Crossroads, a new book (10/15) published by Consumers Union, a 
Washington-based public interest research group. Author Charles Benbrook is the 
former director of the National Research Council's Board on Agriculture. The 
Board's landmark 1989 study, Alternative Agriculture, stirred controversy by 
lauding the economic and environmental benefits of non-chemical farming systems. 

<P>Mr. Benbrook is now a private consultant on global agriculture issues. He 
says he and Consumers Union decided to write Pest Management at the Crossroads 
out of concern that despite all the well-known biological alternatives to 
chemical pest control -- from bacterial pesticides to bug-eating wasps -- 
farmers around the world are more dependent than ever on chemical pesticides:
<P>Benbrook: "Despite all the progress with new...biological control 
technologies from the last thirty years of research, our analysis found clearly 
that reliance on pesticides continues to rise. The reason that it's rising is 
that farmers are designing farming systems and managing pests in ways that are 
pulling the rug out from under natural systems of pest management."
<P>Mr. Benbrook says that on most farms today, overuse of chemical pesticides 
prevents the establishment of natural pest control systems. Worse, he says, it 
triggers the development of pesticide resistance among insect pests. Farmers who 
believe only poisons can protect their crops typically respond by using more 
pesticide, further undermining the chemicals' usefulness. Mr. Benbrook argues in 
his new book that farmers need to step off this so-called "pesticide treadmill" 
and begin moving down what he refers to as the Integrated Pest Management, or 
I-P-M, continuum. This continuum, he says, moves farmers toward a practice he 
calls "biointensive IPM:"
<P>Benbrook: "...which are systems where farmers do everything they can to avoid 
pest problems in the first place, and secondly to use ecological and biological 
processes to lower pest populations. So you tolerate some pests and you keep a 
high degree of biological diversity in your system, and let some of these 
natural checks and balances bear most of the load in managing pests. In those 
sorts of systems we found that pest management is actually more reliable. You 
have fewer dramatic losses in yield. The costs are no greater. There is much 
less highly toxic broad-spectrum pesticide applied, so you have much lower risk 
to farm workers, the environment and to consumers of the food. " 
<P>And contrary to the claims of the agri-chemical industry and its supporters, 
Charles Benbrook says moving away from chemically-based pest management does not 
mean sacrificing crop yields -- provided, he adds, that the shift is gradual and 
balanced. He says a farm on which biointensive I-P-M has been established and is 
properly managed can be a more productive and sustainable farm than one that 
relies on chemical toxins:
<P>Benbrook: "When you start to pull out a lot of the very toxic broad-spectrum 
pesticides from a farming system, you provide the soil micro-organisms and other 
life in the soil a chance to recover, which improves the fertility of the soil 
and its ability to take in water. And you find that crop yields start to go up." 

<P>The American scientist believes the shift from chemically-reliant pest 
control toward more knowledge-based I-P-M will not be an easy transition. That's 
especially true in the United States, he says, where a ten billion dollar a year 
industry and a vast regulatory apparatus support the continued production, sale 
and use of chemical pesticides. Mr. Benbrook says the biointensive I-P-M 
industry in the U-S is still in its infancy. With more farmer, business, and 
government support for research and education -- like the I-P-M initiative the 
Clinton Administration launched in 1993 -- Mr. Benbrook predicts Integrated Pest 
Management will eventually prove its worth in the marketplace:
<P>Benbrook: "We project in the book that about six percent of cropland acreage 
is now managed under biointensive I-P-M, and we call for that percentage to rise 
to essentially 100 percent by 2020. And we think it is going to take about 25 
years to build that infrastructure, to do the science, to create the 
manufacturing plants and the engineering processes that are going to lower the 
costs and increase the effectiveness of these more biologically-oriented 
approaches to pest management."
<P>Charles Benbrook is hopeful his new book will help fuel support for I-P-M, in 
the United States and around the world. The author notes that in researching 
Pest Management at the Crossroads, he drew on the same global information 
resources available today to anyone with interest in the topic and access to the 
World Wide Web computer network. The book itself, not available in bookstores, 
is being marketed through its own Web site --- located at "www.pmac.net." Mr. 
Benbrook hopes people will visit the site not just to order copies of the book, 
but to learn more about the promise of integrated pest management. </B>
