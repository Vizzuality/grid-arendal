<P>It is indeed a privilege to be here today to deliver The Hunger Project 
Millennium Lecture. I am particularly pleased to be here in the company of Joan 
Holmes. Her leadership of The Hunger Project has done so much to awaken people 
and policy makers everywhere to the persistence of hunger in a world of plenty 
which now has the means to eradicate it and has done so much to illuminate the 
pathway to a hunger-free world. </P>
<P>I am proud to join my old friend Dr. M.S. Swaminathan at this important event 
and to recognize him for the tireless and significant contributions he has made, 
and continues to make, to the sustainable development movement, both within 
India and internationally. I first met Dr. Swaminathan some 30 years ago when he 
was director of the Indian Institute of Agricultural Research. Since then have 
been guided and inspired by his vision, his wisdom and his unique capacity to 
combine the best of science with practical methods of applying it to the lives 
of the poorest and the neediest of people. Indeed, I saw a moving and impressive 
example of this in the visits I made with him last weekend to the villages in 
Pondicherry in which the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation has established 
"Knowledge Centres." At these centres, local people can access the kind of 
practical knowledge that enriches their own lives and enhances their capacities 
to earn a self-reliant livelihood. Dr. Swaminathan has always been in the 
forefront of the movement to recognize the essentially systemic relationships 
between hunger, poverty, population and environment and to deal with them in 
this context. So the theme of this lecture and of the subject you have asked me 
to address is most appropriate. </P>
<P>Being here again with you reminds me of the great leadership that India has 
played in moving the world environmental agenda forward and linking it to the 
issues of hunger, poverty and population that are central to the concerns of the 
developing world. In particular, I recall the role that one of Indiaís most 
remarkable leaders, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, played during the first world 
environmental conference held by the United Nations in Stockholm in 1972. As 
many of you will recall, she played key role in elevating the concerns of the 
developing world at the Stockholm conference, and re-fashioning its agenda 
around developing countries' concerns and interests and to encourage other 
developing countries to participate. As you know, she was the star of the 
Stockholm conference. Her speech more than anything set its tone and direction. 
Her memorable statement that "Poverty is the greatest polluter" has become the 
best known and most widely quoted in the folklore of the environmental movement. 
And thanks to her leadership, never more could the environment issue be 
considered only in the narrow context of the pollution problems of the rich. It 
could only be considered as inextricably linked with the development needs and 
aspirations of developing countries and the imperatives for new dimensions of 
co-operation and equity in north-south relationships.</P>
<P>In a world that produces more than enough food to feed everyone, it is a 
scandal that people are hungry and malnourished and an affront to the moral 
basis of our civilization.</P>
<P>It is now twenty-seven years ago since representatives of 113 nations 
assembled in Stockholm in June 1972 for the inauguration of the United Nations 
Conference on the Human Environment. Stockholm was the beginning of "a new 
journey of hope". </P>
<P>It was during the preparations for the Stockholm Conference that the link 
between environment and development was finally made. The most important single 
event in this process was the informal meeting we convened in a motel in Founex 
outside of Geneva with some 30 leading experts and policy leaders. The 
discussions were intense and characterised by a degree of intellectual integrity 
and rigour that ultimately enabled them to find common ground despite 
divergencies of opinions and interest. The meeting is inscribed in my memory as 
one of the best intellectual exchanges in which I have ever participated and it 
certainly had a profound influence both on the Stockholm Conference and the 
evolution of the environment-development relationship. The meeting resulted in 
the production of the Founex Report on Development and Environment, which I 
regard as a seminal milestone in the history of the environmental movement.</P>
<P>The Founex Report called for an expansion of the entire concept of 
environment to link it directly to the economic development process and the 
priorities of developing countries. The basic thesis was that although in 
individual instances there were conflicts between environmental and economic 
priorities, they were intrinsically two sides of the same coin. It is, after 
all, through the process of economic development that we impact on the 
environment, both positively and negatively. And it is only through better 
management of the development process that the basic goals of development – to 
eradicate poverty and to improve the lives and prospects of people in 
environmental and social as well as economic terms could be achieved. It 
recognised that priorities would vary in each country depending on its stage of 
development and its own priorities. It also recognized that the needs of 
developing countries could best be addressed by a renewed commitment to the 
development process itself and dealing with the environmental dimension as an 
integral dimension of development rather than a separate impediment to 
development.</P>
<P>Essentially, the Founex Report, and the Stockholm Conference for which it was 
prepared, confirmed that poverty and environment are linked in a vicious spiral 
in which degradation of the environment increases poverty while poverty 
increases environmental degradation. Mrs. Indira Gandhi made this point cogently 
when she said: "the environment cannot be improved in conditions of poverty – 
how can we speak to those who live in villages and slums about keeping the 
oceans, the rivers and the air clean when their own live are contaminated at the 
source."</P>
<P>Despite progress in many areas following the Stockholm Conference, it became 
evident by the mid-1980s that, overall, the environment wash still deteriorating 
and that population and economic growth were largely responsible for this. In 
response, the United Nations General Assembly established a World Commission for 
Environment and Development under the chairmanship of Norway's Gro Harlem 
Brundtland. Its report "Our Common Future" made the case for sustainable 
development as the only viable pathway to a secure and hopeful future for the 
human community. Its recommendations provided an important input to the decision 
by the UN General Assembly in December 1989 to hold the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development. To underscore the importance of this conference, it 
was decided that it should be held at the summit level and it is now known 
universally as the "Earth Summit". </P>
<P>As an event itself, Rio was clearly remarkable, indeed historic. Never before 
had so many of the world's political leaders come together in one place, and the 
fact that they came to consider the urgent question of our planet's future put 
these issues under an enormous international spotlight. This was helped by the 
presence at Rio, both in the conference itself and the accompanying "Global 
Forum", of an unprecedented number of people and organisations representing 
every sector of civil society, and more than double the number of media 
representatives than had ever covered a world conference.</P>
<P>This "people-pressure" helped to move governments to agree on a set of 
principles, the Declaration of Rio, and a comprehensive program of action to 
give effect to these principles, Agenda 21.</P>
<P>The Earth Summit produced agreement on two historic framework conventions, 
one on Climate Change and the other on Biodiversity, which have since, come into 
effect. It also launched the negotiating process that has led to agreement on a 
Convention on Desertification, an issue of special importance to many developing 
countries, particularly in the arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. </P>
<P>I am pleased to note that India has been one of the most influential nations 
in shaping these international conventions, and has taken a leading role in 
promoting the interests of the developing world vis-à-vis the implementation of 
these agreements. From Stockholm through to Rio, India has championed the shared 
concern of most developing countries that inadequate availability of funds for 
the financing of sustainable development remains the greatest impediment to 
alleviating the hunger, poverty and environmental degradation which continue to 
plague to less developed countries.</P>
<P>In 1993, in the aftermath of the Earth Summit, India launched its National 
Environment Action Program with a series of measures to protect biodiversity and 
forests. Particularly important were the measures the Indian government took to 
provide for democratic decentralisation to local bodies. The government took a 
vital step to ensure the participation of women, requiring that they comprise at 
least one-third of the representation on such bodies.</P>
<P>And it was at its first Assembly in India last year that the Global 
Environment Facility reached agreement, following protracted and difficult 
negotiations, on the replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) with 
unique modalities for governance which give developing countries a larger role 
than in the Bretton Woods Institutions. The GEF is a far cry from the much more 
ambitious vision of the late Rajiv Gandhi when he proposed the creation of a 
"Planet Protection Fund". But it provides the foundations on which the 
international community can continue to build, as the imperatives of the future 
will inevitably require more enlightened, innovative and substantial responses 
to the resource needs of developing countries than have yet been forthcoming on 
the part of the major industrial nations.</P>
<P>India will have an enormously important role to play in the global community 
in the next millennium. Already the second most populous country on earth, 
India's population is expected to reach 1 billion in August of this year, and is 
projected to add another 500 million people by the year 2050. Population growth 
is clearly a major global issue. But it is first and foremost a problem for 
those countries that are experiencing this growth and must manage the pressure 
it creates on scarce land and resources to meet the need and expectations of 
their people on a sustainable basis. This is not an easy issue. Life itself is 
very precious. Indeed, the reverence for life, including the plant and animal 
life, is deeply entrenched in Indiaís traditional value systems. Yet to confine 
people to a life of poverty and suffering is neither just nor necessary. There 
is not doubt that India can support its present and projected population at a 
level that will enable all to enjoy reasonable standards. But it will take 
profound changes in the ways in which resources are developed and deployed and 
priorities set to do this.</P>
<P>Ecologically, India is home to more than 45,000 plant species, several 
thousand of which are endemic to India and found nowhere else in the world. The 
biological diversity of the country is so rich – especially in the Eastern 
Himalayas and the Western Ghats – that it may play a very important and crucial 
role in future for the survival of humankind if it is conserved and used with 
the utmost care. However, India's traditional environmental problems – those 
traditionally associated with poverty, including deforestation, a lack of 
potable water, land degradation, and poor sanitation – are rapidly being 
accompanied by a new generation of environmental problems stemming from rapid 
industrialisation. These new pressures include increased industrial pollution, 
ecologically unsound commercial agriculture, and the over-exploitation of 
natural resources. Likewise, as their development accelerates, countries like 
India are contributing more and more to the larger global risks such as those of 
climate change, ozone depletion, degradation of biological resources, and loss 
or deterioration of arable lands. China has already become the second largest 
source of CO2 emissions and will almost certainly succeed the United States to 
the dubious honor of becoming number one. India, with its booming population, 
cannot be far behind. The prospect of a massive increase in Third World energy 
consumption over the next 30 years boldly underlines a point I have been making 
since before the Earth Summit. It is the industrialised world that must reduce 
its environmental impact in order to "leave space" for developing countries to 
meet their own needs and aspirations. There is now overwhelming evidence that 
the industrialised world cannot continue in its historical patterns of 
production and consumption.</P>
<P>Neither can developing countries be denied the right to grow. Nor can they be 
expected to respond to exhortations to reduce their population growth and adopt 
stringent environmental controls from those whose patterns of production and 
consumption have largely given rise to global risks like climate change. This 
means recognising the special responsibilities of the traditional industrialised 
countries to ensure developing countries the access to the capital and 
technologies they require for their transition to sustainable development and to 
cooperate fully in measures to protect the planet's future. </P>
<P>Although India is among the countries which are at the vanguard of 
environmental protection, the added burden from its increasing population – and 
the economic growth which will have to accompany it if poverty is to be 
alleviated – will present a tremendous burden on the country's ecological 
endowment into the next century. Already the constraints are evident, depletion 
and contamination of ground water, loss of soil in the forest. Continue on with 
new paragraph</P>
<P>As custodians of most of the biological resources on which the sustainability 
and well-being of the world community depends, developing countries like India 
provide products and services that are necessary to the continued integrity and 
sustainability of the Earth's resource and life-support systems. But the 
indispensable services they provide have always been taken for granted and 
treated as free goods. We must now begin to place an economic value on them if 
we are to expect developing countries to maintain them largely for the benefit 
of the rest of the world. </P>
<P>One of the most disappointing trends since the Earth Summit in 1992 is the 
lack of response by OECD countries to the needs of developing countries for the 
additional financial resources which all governments at Rio agreed were required 
to enable developing countries to make their transition to sustainable 
development. What is particularly discouraging is that progress towards meeting 
these needs has actually been further set back since Rio as a number of donors 
have reduced their Official Development Assistance. And all the signs currently 
point to further reductions accompanied by a diversion of resources that might 
have been available for development assistance to meet growing emergency 
humanitarian needs. </P>
<P>With the continuing trend of reductions in Official Development Assistance we 
must be much more innovative in motivating private capital – now the principal 
source of financial flows to developing countries – to contribute more to 
sustainable development. This is particularly true as more and more developing 
countries move to privatization in such key sectors as water, waste disposal, 
electric power and transport. And the very scale and intensity of the 
sustainable development challenge requires a heavy reliance on technological 
solutions for which the private sector is the primary vehicle. At the same time, 
the systemic nature of sustainable development requires a much greater degree of 
cooperation both amongst key industry actors and financial institutions and 
between them and governments.</P>
<P>To be sure, there have been some positive developments. Many developing 
countries, including, I am pleased to say, India, have taken steps to implement 
many of the measures called for in Agenda 21. For example, the UNDP's most 
recent Human Development Report, India is referenced as planting four hectares 
of forest for each hectare felled in the country. The Human Development Report 
also points out that India aims to provide 10% of its electricity from renewable 
sources by 2012. This is in spite of the fact that Rio's promises of additional 
financial resources for sustainable development initiatives remain unfulfilled. 
To some degree this is understandable. Fundamental change does not come quickly 
or easily and the seven years that have elapsed since the Earth Summit, and even 
the twenty-seven years that have passed since the Stockholm conference, are too 
short to have expected such change to have occurred. Nevertheless, we cannot 
afford to be complacent in light of evidence that we continue along a pathway 
that is not sustainable while the driving forces of population growth in 
developing countries and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in 
industrialised countries persist. </P>
<P>Today's "world order" is much different from that which prevailed at the time 
of the Stockholm Conference in 1972. Today developing countries are leading the 
revitalisation of the global economy. Developing countries <U>are</U> growing. 
Not all of them, to be sure. The economic growth of many of the poorest, as well 
as the conflict-ridden countries of Africa, has been stalled or declined. But in 
Africa, too – notably Uganda and Ghana – some economies are on the move again 
and with the historic transformation to multi-racial democracy in South Africa, 
it is expected to lead Southern Africa into a new era of economic progress. A 
recent World Bank report points out that even in the two decades 1974 – 1993, 
developing countries as a whole grew at a rate slightly higher (3%) than the 
rich industrial countries (2.9%) and, despite recent set-backs, are expected to 
grow by almost 5% per year in the next decade compared with 2.7% in the 
traditional industrial countries. But most of the new growth in the developing 
world is occurring in Asia and Latin America. India is becoming one of the most 
dynamically growing economies. In our modern technological civilization, 
knowledge is the primary source of added value and competitive advantage. India 
is notably rich in its intellectual resources and technological skills. It is 
capital that is in short supply in India. But despite continuing ambivalence 
about the role of foreign capital, India is now attracting growing flows of 
private capital. According to a survey by <I>The Economist</I>, India is 
expected to replace Germany as the fourth largest economy by the year 2020. And 
the same survey projects that developing countries' share of world output will 
grow to 62% by 2020 while that of the rich industrial countries will decline to 
37%.</P>
<P>The basic character of the economies of the developing countries is also 
undergoing a major transformation. Most have moved beyond their traditional role 
as exporters of raw materials and commodities. Manufactured goods now constitute 
some 60% of developing country exports as compared to only 5% in 1955. And their 
share of world manufacturing exports rose from 5% in 1970 to 22% in 1993.</P>
<P>The major movement of economic growth to the south is evoking mixed feelings, 
and responses, from the traditional industrialised countries, the "OECD" 
countries. On the one hand, their export industries have welcomed – and been 
quick to exploit – the opportunities that have opened up in the rapidly growing 
economies of the developing world. A recent OECD report postulates that if 
China, India, and Indonesia continue to grow at current rates, without changing 
current patterns of income distribution, some 700 million people in these three 
countries alone – more than the combined populations of America, the European 
Union and Japan, will, by 2010, have an average income equivalent to that of 
Spain. This compares with only 100 million today.</P>
<P>On the other hand, OECD countries are increasingly looking on developing 
countries as competitors. Low labour costs and rising productivity are making 
their manufactured products highly competitive in northern markets – helping to 
keep consumer prices down but evoking strong and growing resistance from those 
in the industrial countries that see their investments and jobs at risk.</P>
<P>The G-7, which today does not include a single developing country, is clearly 
becoming an anachronism. The current "world order" continues to be rooted in the 
past, particularly our notions as to north-south relationships. This fundamental 
shift in North – South relations could have an even greater effect on the 
geo-political landscape and the prospects for international co-operation than 
the end of the Cold War. The line between the traditional have- and have-not 
nations is blurring as a result of the economic progress being made by some 
developing countries. But, at the same time, the income gap between the rich and 
the poor is growing both within and between countries. In 1965, the average per 
capita income of the G-7 industrialised countries was 20 times that of the 
world's poorest seven countries. By 1995, it was about 50 times greater. Though 
a number of developing countries have been growing faster than the developed 
market economies, growth rates were not fast enough to narrow the absolute per 
capita income gap. </P>
<P>Thus, we cannot rely on an over-all increase in GNP as a reliable indicator 
of human development. Yes, economic growth does have the potential to reduce 
poverty, but equating growth with poverty reduction is too simplistic. 
Nation-wide, India did not see a consistent drop in poverty between the 1950s 
and 1970s despite a reasonable economic growth rate. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 
number of income poor has actually increased due to population growth. Between 
1951 and 1994, the number of income poor has in actual fact doubled from 170 
million to 340 million. The disparity between increase in GNP and actual numbers 
of income poor is mainly due to an historical focus on the expansion of total 
economic output than on its distribution. All efforts went into building heavy 
industry and public enterprises rather than on micro-enterprises that employ the 
poor.</P>
<P>Likewise, the Green Revolution helped agricultural growth in India, but 
little effort has been made to distribute the benefits equitably. The Green 
Revolution favoured the large and wealthier farmers who could afford to take 
advantage of it and exacerbated the plight of the small holders, the landless 
and farm labourers. Critics also point to the environmental and health impacts 
from the massive increase in the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers 
which the Green Revolution entailed, to the vulnerabilities which may arise 
through the spread of monocultures in which indigenous plant stocks are replaced 
by new, genetically engineered varieties.</P>
<P>The technology of the Green Revolution that dramatically boosted grain 
supplies throughout the 1960s and 1970s appear to be running out of steam. The 
growth in cereal yields in developing countries has slowed from 3% a year in the 
1970s to around 2% in the 1980s and 1990s. Another area of vulnerability is the 
increase in the use of meat, as it becomes affordable to an increasing 
proportion of the world's population, particularly in rapidly developing 
countries. Some two of every five tons of grain produced in the world is fed to 
livestock, poultry or fish. Two kilograms of grain are required to produce a 
kilo of chicken or fish. For grain-fed cattle, the conversion ratio is up to 7 
kilos of grain for a kilo of meat. Between now and 2020, about 80% of the 
increase in demand for cereals is likely to be in developing countries. </P>
<P>While there is clearly some validity in these concerns, they do not outweigh 
the benefits that have been achieved in sparing millions of people from the 
plight of hunger and malnutrition and relieving major food-deficit nations, 
notably India, from their dependence on imports of food grains. India, widely 
expected to be an agricultural basket-case by the 1950, has instead become 
self-sufficient in food production and a net exporter of food grains.</P>
<P>As you know, Lester Brown of WorldWatch has long been warning against 
complacency and pointing to the growing vulnerabilities in the world's food 
supply system. FAO has called for massive new efforts to improve food security 
at both national and household levels based on a "new" green revolution, drawing 
on the social-economic lessons of the Green Revolution as well as its advances 
in agricultural science. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural 
Research, as part of its renewal program, has called for a "doubly green 
revolution", green for productivity and green for environmental and natural 
resource management. The World Bank is revisiting its own policies on 
agriculture and, under President Jim Wolfensohn, is giving it renewed priority. 
The great African famine of 1984 to 1986 demonstrated dramatically how 
ecological deterioration as a result of overgrazing and loss of trees and grass 
cover can turn drought conditions into devastating famine.</P>
<P>The role of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research 
(CGIAR) is to combat poverty and hunger through research based on the best and 
latest in science. CGIAR mobilises the national and international agricultural 
research communities to sharply focus their research efforts and their practical 
results to meet the challenges of food security, sustainability, and poverty 
alleviation.</P>
<P>The CGIAR, so much at the forefront of international agricultural science in 
its 27-year history, is a unique informal consultative group that can be proud 
of its major accomplishments. It was primarily responsible for doubling the 
yield of rice, wheat and maize over a period of the last 30 years. We face a 
similar challenge to again double world food production in the next 30 years. 
Moreover this food has to be produced in locations where the population 
concentration and growth is high – that is, in the developing countries.</P>
<P>The decade of the 1990s has brought the concerns of sustainability to the 
fore. Sustainable development is not just an option, but an imperative, in 
environmental, economic and social terms. It requires a major commitment by 
governments, the scientific and research community, business and industry, and 
civil society. A global research and development partnership is essential to set 
the world community onto a new course for a more sustainable, secure and 
equitable future as we move into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P>
<P>We now recognise and have begun to understand the major environmental, 
economic and social issues confronting our ability to overcome hunger and 
poverty. The ecological consequences of ozone depletion, climate change, soil 
degradation, loss of biodiversity and the increasing pollution of the air, the 
water, and land threaten the worldís food system and its sustainable future.</P>
<P>International agricultural research is an imperative. The agricultural 
research community must meet this challenge. It requires a shift in priorities 
and focus of research, involving the full integration of the environmental 
dimension into agricultural research and social and economic development 
policies. There has to be real and functional agricultural research partnerships 
at the national and international levels.</P>
<P>Agricultural research must concentrate more attention on creating a positive 
synthesis between the modern scientific techniques that have been pioneered and 
traditional knowledge and practice. This means integrating their work more fully 
with the institutions, scientists, and farmers in the communities in which they 
are located and to which their work pertains. Sustainability cannot be 
understood, let alone practised without the participation and traditional 
knowledge of the farmers.</P>
<P>Tragically, the traditional knowledge of farming communities is eroding 
rapidly along with their agricultural genetics resources. Ecologically specific 
knowledge of useful food species as well as pests and diseases is often attached 
to local languages. During this century, the world lost 4000 of its 10000 
languages, and researchers tell us almost half of todayís surviving languages 
are not being taught to the next generation. This has led some to suggest that 
the world is actually losing more knowledge than it gains. Whether this is a 
certainty or not, the reality remains that a vast treasure trove of invaluable 
survival and scientific knowledge is disappearing and may not be replaceable. 
Even today, in Latin America, one third of the land area is peopled with farmers 
who no longer have an indigenous language. The research community must find the 
links between high science and community innovations systems.</P>
<P>Integration of crop-specific research must embrace the concept of 
sustainability. The land, the water, biodiversity and all natural resources must 
be managed sustainably to deliver satisfying livelihoods for all the poor. The 
responsible and sustainable use of resources is a fundamental challenge for all 
– in developing and developed countries.</P>
<P>In India, the tradition is that one must look after the resources inherited 
from oneís parents. The Indians in the Americas believe that they are custodians 
of resources borrowed from their children. The issues of sustainable natural 
resources management and ecoregional approaches are central to agricultural 
research.</P>
<P>If there ever was a case for complacency, it has surely been overtaken by the 
sobering evidence of the challenge we face in doubling world food production by 
the year 2025. It will be a formidable task, but even more daunting will be the 
challenge of ensuring that poor people in food-deficit areas receive the quality 
and quantities of food they will require for their basic sustenance.</P>
<P>The knowledge and the technologies developed primarily as a result of the 
Green Revolution will, I believe, make it possible to produce the food the world 
will need in the foreseeable future on a globally aggregated basis. This is 
subject to the major qualification that we do not at this point know how food 
production may be affected by climate change. The other issue is how to match 
food availability with food needs, particularly on the part of the poor. Even in 
times of food scarcity those with the resources to purchase food can usually 
obtain it. Conversely, even in times of food abundance those without the means 
are often hungry and malnourished. Poverty, more than lack of availability, is 
what denies many the access to the food they need.</P>
<P>The availability of potable water is another issue with potentially explosive 
consequences in the next millennium. On a global basis more than 1 billion 
people do not have ready access to an adequate and safe water supply. More than 
800 million of those unserved live in rural areas. In 1990, 20 countries 
suffered chronic water shortages. By 2025, the World Bank expects that number to 
rise to 34.</P><I>
<P>The Hindustan Times</I> recently commented on the fast-deteriorating water 
situation in India, where water tables are falling almost everywhere and wells 
are going to dry up by the thousands. "If our population continues to grow as it 
is nowÖ it is certain that a major part of the country would be in the grip of a 
severe water famine in 10 to 15 yearsÖ" India's ambitious use of its water 
resources may have helped to unite an otherwise diverse country, but it has 
exacerbated cross-border tensions with downstream countries including Bangladesh 
and Pakistan.</P>
<P>Ismail Serageldin, the World Bank's vice president of environmental affairs 
and chairman of the World Water Commission stated bluntly a few years ago that 
the wars of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century would be fought over water. Although he 
was criticised for this opinion, he refused to disavow it and has frequently 
asserted that water is the most critical issue facing human development. Former 
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the late King Hussein of Jordan have 
both said something similar.</P>
<P>Even this very inadequate summary of some of the constraints and 
vulnerabilities we confront in meeting the world's future food needs underscore 
the complexity of this challenge and its relationship with the broad range of 
factors that are shaping the future of our technological civilisation. The 
eradication of poverty and hunger is an essential pre-condition to a secure and 
sustainable future for the human community as a whole.</P>
<P>The good news is that technology has played a crucial role in providing more 
goods to more people and can still help us find ways to use renewable and 
non-renewable natural resources more efficiently. Production in quantitative 
terms is not the main problem. Quality and sustainability production <U>is</U>. 
Particularly important in terms of overcoming hunger is to increase the 
productivity of the poor. Making available to them the knowledge and the tools 
which science and technology can now provide, to increase their own capacity to 
improve their livelihoods.</P>
<P>The evidence produced at the Earth Summit, and confirmed by experience since 
then, makes it clear that "eco-efficiency", i.e., – efficiency in the use of 
energy and materials as well as in the prevention, recycling and disposal of 
wastes, is the key to sustainability and long-term environmental protection. 
Eco-efficiency is a critical tool that will enable us to move along a pathway to 
a secure and sustainable future in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P>
<P>Let me give you an example that is close to home: According to current 
ecological footprint analysis, India has a per capita footprint of 0.8 hectares. 
That means it takes 0.8 hectares of biologically productive space to support the 
average Indian's lifestyle. This is in contrast to an American's ecological 
footprint, which has been calculated at 10.3 – more than 10 times that of the 
average Indian's. However, on a global basis, only 2 hectares are available per 
world citizen. This means that India is consuming less than half its available 
global share of resources. </P>
<P>However, India's ability to take possession of its full share of global 
resources is hampered by rich nations' demands for food, energy and other 
resources, as rich nations in effect appropriate the resource stocks of poor and 
otherwise disadvantaged nations like India. If everyone were to consume in the 
manner of the rich nations today, an extra three planets like Earth would be 
required. This is clearly an untenable situation especially when considered 
within the context of the evidence produced at the Earth Summit. Chapter 4 of 
Agenda 21 points out, "Ö the major cause of the continued deterioration of the 
global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production, 
particularly in developed countries".</P>
<P>Jawaharlal Nehru commented on this paradox in an article on "The Strange 
Behaviour of Money" in which he said that "the extraordinary spectacle of 
abundance and poverty existing side by side" and that "if capitalism is not 
advanced enough ..., some other system must be evolved more in keeping with 
science". And a recent article in "The Economist" – hardly a radical publication 
– stated that "if the Marxist prediction of a proletariat plunged into abject 
misery under capitalism has so far been unfulfilled, the widening gap between 
haves and have-nots is causing some to think that Marx might yet be proved right 
on this point after all".</P>
<P>Clearly, democratic, market capitalism must find ways of dealing with these 
emerging dilemmas or risk becoming the victim of its own success. It must become 
just as effective at meeting society's needs as it is in generating economic 
growth. Where large sections of society are denied the ability to participate in 
the benefits of the prevailing economic system, that system will not be 
sustainable. A mercantile society without a soul, however successful it may be 
in material terms, will not be sustainable.</P>
<P>As they move into a new era of economic growth, developing countries have a 
rare opportunity – and need – to fashion their own development model. As Prime 
Minister Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao said in a speech a couple of years ago to 
Harvard University, "it will have to find an equilibrium among three factors, 
viz:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>-the level of material benefit necessary for a human being to attain his full 
creative potential;</P>
<P>-the level of exploitation of Nature consistent with its needs to replenish 
itself;</P>
<P>-the need to ensure comparable benefit to the vast masses of people and lift 
the social pyramid as a whole."</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>This is as good a definition of sustainable development as I have heard.</P>
<P>No country is in a better position to take the lead in creation of this new 
sustainable development model than India because of the strength and experience 
of its democracy, its diverse natural resource base, its formidable scientific 
and technological capabilities, its well developed industrial sector and 
entrepreneurial tradition, the quality and strength of its institutions and 
professional cadres, its commitment to education and its high degree of 
environmental awareness. And no country has a greater need to do so in its own 
interests. </P>
<P>The 1998 Hindu Survey of the Environment raises the provocative question: "is 
building highways and dams more important for a developing country than 
conserving the natural environment and peoples livelihoods? These are sometimes 
seen as mutually exclusive in the environment versus development debate. Yet, 
countries need both infrastructure development and environmental safeguards. To 
reconcile these two needs, new paradigms and alternative systems have to be 
considered. At present, environmental protection is introduced as an 
afterthought." One of the most encouraging movements that has developed as a 
result of the Earth Summit has been initiative of local communities, leadership 
of the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives, to develop 
local Agendas 21 based on Rioís Global Agenda 21. Some 3000 cities and towns 
around the world have now done this and have found in it a dynamic means of 
bringing their communities together to frame a common vision of a future to 
which they aspire and to work together in achieving it. </P>
<P>I am convinced that India now has an historic opportunity – one which will 
not likely even recur – to establish a new development model based on a 
synthesis of Gandhi's principals of Sarvodaya and people-centred rural 
development with Nehru's commitment to science, technology and modernisation. It 
will not be easy to effect this synthesis; and it will require an enlightened 
and sustained political will of the kind India has always been able to produce. 
India's leadership in the transition to a new model of sustainable development 
is, I am persuaded, the key to its own future and to its role in the world of 
the 21st century. </P>
<P>India is home to extraordinarily rich experience in development alternatives, 
springing from the grassroots. India should first turn to its own experience to 
help chart the road to human development – by reflecting on its own well 
documented achievements and challenges in reducing poverty. Improving growth and 
incomes, while at the same time being aware that development is multidimensional 
and people-centered is essential for achieving long-lasting and sustainable 
results.</P>
<P>India's rich experience in development stems primarily from India's 
tremendous cultural diversity, which is often seen as the country's greatest 
weakness in that it is the source of a great deal of conflict. However, 
diversity does not need to be a weakness. Diversity can be a source of strength, 
but only if tolerance and respect for the beliefs and practices of others and a 
commitment to a common set of values and principles that are essential to the 
survival and well being of the entire human community accompany it. These 
include first and foremost a respect for life itself and a commitment to the 
behaviour and practices that will ensure its sustainability and its qualities. 
We need new dimensions of co-operation across the boundaries of nations, 
disciplines, sectors and institutions to ensure the integrity of the ecological, 
resource and social systems that sustain life on Earth. We must exercise, 
individually and co-operatively, a high degree of responsible stewardship over 
the precious resources of the Earth which sustain and nourish its life. Caring 
for and sharing with each other can no longer be seen as pious ideals, divorced 
from reality, but as the indispensable requirements for a secure and sustainable 
future.</P>
<P>One of my disappointments in the results of the Earth Summit was our 
inability to obtain an agreement on an Earth Charter to define a set of moral 
and ethical principles for the conduct of people and nations toward each other 
and the earth as the basis for achieving a sustainable way of life on our 
planet. Governments were simply not ready for it. They agreed on a Rio 
Declaration, but, they did not complete the job of agreeing on an Earth Charter, 
and therefore people are now taking up this. The Earth Council has joined with 
many other organisations to undertake this piece of unfinished business from Rio 
through a global campaign designed to stimulate dialogue and enlist of the 
contributions of people everywhere to the formulation of a People's Earth 
Charter. This process began with a conference in the Hague in May 1995, through 
the sponsorship of the Dutch government, and has been gaining momentum ever 
since.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Earth Charter will command the support of people throughout the world. By 
commanding their support, as the true voice of people (after all, the United 
Nation's Charter begins "We the Peoples...") The Earth Charter is going to be a 
product of people's commitments. Those commitments will clearly serve to 
motivate governments. And through the political process, people are making it 
clear that they expect high standards of environmental responsibility from their 
leaders. </P>
<P>The aim of the Earth Charter consultation process is to bring the Earth 
Charter to people everywhere; to enlist the co-operation and the help of 
organisations of every kind: citizen's organisations, non-governmental 
organisations, educational organisations, youth organisations, and of course 
religious and spiritual organisations. We want to enlist all of them in the task 
of trying to ensure that the Earth Charter reflects the thinking, and the 
concerns, and the values of people everywhere. We want to distil those universal 
values that we all must share in order to ensure our common future. And, to put 
it language that speaks to people everywhere but also ensures that people are 
the source of the Charter.</P>
<P>I am pleased to note that India has been pursuing a series of consultations 
on the Earth Charter, thanks to Earth Charter Commission member Kamla Chowdhry 
and to my colleague Ashok Khosla with Development Alternatives in New Delhi. 
Specifically, India has noted that lifestyle and biodiversity concerns of 
tropical countries are different from those of temperate countries, and that 
this should be noted in the Earth Charter. Likewise, the Indian consultations 
endorsed the need for truly democratic governance structures in which power 
flows upward from the people, as advocated by Gandhi.</P>
<P>After all, the ultimate goal of sustainable development is to enable 
<B><I>people</B></I> to achieve sustainable livelihoods. Hunger is experienced 
at the level of people; and it is at the level of people that it must be 
addressed, and people can do it if they have a supportive fiscal and policy 
environment.</P>
<P>Nations everywhere are now encountering the limits of governments – limits on 
their capacity to meet the expectations of their electorates, limits on the 
willingness of people to accept new taxes and their insistence on a greater 
degree of cost effectiveness, transparency and accountability on the part of 
their governments. This is directly related to the movement that has taken place 
towards more democratic forms of government throughout the world. It is a 
movement in which India, in demonstrating its strength and resilience as the 
world's largest democracy, has set such an outstanding example. It is therefore 
not surprising that India is also in the vanguard of the movement from merely 
representative to participatory democracy, which makes more effective provision 
for the increasingly important and activist role being played by the various 
organisations of the civil society.</P>
<P>Global sustainability will be built on the foundations of people power and 
local action. It cannot be built from the "top down." But the global framework 
must be supportive.</P>
<P>Recent experience in which the collapse of some of the most dynamic economies 
of Asia rapidly developed into a crisis threatening the entire global economy, 
dramatically brought home to us that the benefits of globalisation are 
accompanied by a new generation of perils. No nation can manage these perils 
alone. Neither can any of the main issues that affect the quality of life and 
sustainability of the human community – access to food and water, managing the 
pressures for migration, protecting the environment, meeting social needs, 
ensuring employment and livelihoods, and of course, maintaining peace and 
security – be managed in isolation. As ecologists have long reminded us, the 
forces through which our actions have their ultimate impacts are systemic in 
nature. They must be managed systemically if we are to develop the secure and 
sustainable way of life on our planet that must be our principal goal as we move 
into the new millennium.</P>
<P>The principal message of the Earth Summit was that we must make the 
transition to a new global partnership in which all share equitably the benefits 
as well as the risks. As Rio made clear, this requires new dimensions of 
co-operation amongst the nations and peoples of our planet, and most of all a 
new basis for relationships between the rich, industrialised countries and the 
developing world.</P>
<P></P>
<P>I am convinced that prospects for the human future will be determined, 
perhaps decisively, by what we do, or fail to do in our generation. For we are 
literally trustees of our own future. As the environmental movement has evolved 
from Stockholm through the Law of the Sea, to the Brundtland Commission to the 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, we have enlarged the context in which we must 
view and deal with the challenge of protecting and improving the environment. 
This larger context embraces the complex system of relationships through which 
our economic aspirations and behaviour must be reconciled with our environmental 
and social goals. What we have come to call sustainable development provides the 
larger framework for achieving a positive synthesis between the social, economic 
and environmental dimensions of the development process. This is no mere passing 
phase, but a fundamental process of civilizational change, which is essential, 
if we are to move onto the pathway to a secure and sustainable future in the new 
millennium.</P>
<P>Individuals often believe that they can make little difference in the larger 
scheme of things. But they can. Indeed, without individual change there cannot 
be societal change. For in the final analysis the behaviour of individuals as 
well as the priorities of society respond not only to our narrow economic and 
security interests, as important as these are, but ultimately to the deepest 
moral, ethical and spiritual values of people. Again, India is unique. No nation 
has a greater diversity of religious and spiritual traditions. Yet it was 
established as a secular state on the basic moral and ethical principles 
promulgated by Mahatma Gandhi and implemented by Jawaharlal Nehru and his 
successors. Respect for the rights of all of India's diverse communities, and 
particularly its most disadvantaged, has become a strong and durable feature of 
India's national life. It should not be surprising that conflicts and tensions 
continue to arise; what is more important is that these have not been allowed to 
subvert the basic nature of Indian democracy and its continuing respect for 
diversity and the rights of its minorities.</P>
<P>The principles that Mahatma Gandhi espoused and died for, and the leadership 
of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi inspired the hopes of all developing 
countries and evoked the respect and esteem of the entire world community. They 
provide the historical and the moral foundations on which those who have 
succeeded them in the leadership of this great nation are now working to fashion 
a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable future for India and all the peoples 
of our "Only One Earth".</P>
<P>India has the capacity to eradicate hunger and poverty and to take the lead 
in creating a hunger-free world. Indeed it is the first time ever that this is 
really feasible. What is needed is a new political will based on a 
revitalisation of the moral and ethical foundations that have motivated people 
and societies at their best.</P>
<P>The good examples you have already delivered show how it can be done. These 
must be moved to the centre of the development agenda. What is possible must now 
become inevitable.</P>
<P>I am persuaded that the 21st century will be decisive for the human species. 
For all the evidences of environmental degradation, social tension and 
inter-communal conflict have occurred at levels of population and human activity 
that are a great deal less than they will be in the 21st Century. All people and 
nations have in the past been willing to accord highest priority to the measures 
required for their own security. We must give the same kind of priority to 
civilizational security and sustainability. This will take a major shift in the 
current political mind-set. Necessity will compel such a shift eventually; the 
question is can we really afford the costs and risks of 
waiting.</P></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
