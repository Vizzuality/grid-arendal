      <P align=left><BR>At the end of 1994 member countries of the European 
      Commission reached agreement on a Directive to minimise waste by reducing 
      the amount of packaging used and entering the waste stream. The Directive, 
      known as the European Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (PWD), 
      set Europe-wide recovery and recycling targets to be met by the year 2001. 
      The Directive covered all kinds of packaging materials, including 
      aluminium, glass, paper, board, plastic and steel. Wood and other 
      materials will be included from 2000. </P>
      <P align=left>The PWD’s definition of packaging included any material used 
      for containment, protection, handling, delivery or presentation of goods, 
      and was divided into three categories:</P><B>
      <P align=left>primary</B> - packaging around individual items at point of 
      sale;</P><B>
      <P align=left>secondary</B> - packaging surrounding groups of products for 
      storage or for display at point of sale;</P><B>
      <P align=left>tertiary</B> - packaging for transport purposes. </P>
      <P align=left>The Directive decreed that between 50 - 65 per cent of 
      packaging waste by weight must be recovered by the year 2001. Of this a 
      minimum of 25% overall and 15% of each material must be recycled.</P>
      <P align=left>Each EU member country has been responsible for devising its 
      own national strategy for meeting the targets required by the Directive. 
      In Britain this has taken the form of the Producer Responsibility 
      Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations.</P>

      Producer Responsibility (SPR) evolved in 1995, and in 1996 the Government

      highest recovery and recycling rates of any packaging material in the UK. 
      In 1998 we consumed over 4.2m tonnes of paper packaging; 2.6m tonnes were 
      domestically produced. On the basis of evidence of Compliance provided to 
      the EA and SEPA, 1.89 million tonnes were recycled. However statistics 
      </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>collated by The Paper Federation show that 
      1.69m tonnes of post consumer packaging waste were recycled. Significant 
      disparities in packaging waste and recovery/recycling statistics provided 
      by registered obligated parties and from industry assessments remain to be 
      resolved. </P>
      <P align=left>Current paper packaging recycling rates are considerably in 
      excess of the 2001 national target level of 15%. However, the EU Directive 
      specifies that the overall recovery target can be met in any material. 
      Given that most other materials will fail to reach this level, it is 
      inevitable that, if the national recovery target is to be met, the 
      recovery of paper packaging will have to exceed 50%, probably by a 
      considerable margin. This is despite the expectation that, by 2001, paper 
      packaging's share of the overall packaging waste stream will be no more 
      than 48%. Some estimates suggest that paper packaging recovery (including 
      Energy from Waste) will have to increase by more than 25% over the 1996 
      level. The industry is concerned that the increase in the financial 
      turnover threshold will increase the number of "free-riders", placing even 
      greater responsibility on obligated companies. It hopes that the increased 
      targets will create a greater demand for PRNs, thus allowing them to 
      fulfil their intended purpose.</FONT></P>
