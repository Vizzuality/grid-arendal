      <P>This is the Final Report of the International Joint Commission to the 
      governments of the United States and Canada concerning protection of the 
      waters of the Great Lakes. It is submitted in response to a February 10, 
      1999 Reference from the governments to undertake a study of such 
      protection.<BR><BR>This Final Report incorporates and where appropriate 
      updates the Commission's Interim Report of August 10, 1999. It also 
      extends and, in some cases, modifies the conclusions reached and 
      recommendations made in the Interim Report.</P>

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=1></A>Section 1 - 
      Introduction:</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>Water is an important and often emotional issue throughout North 
      America. Along the U.S.–Canadian border there have been many controversial 
      issues involving boundary and transboundary water resources, and there 
      also have been many opportunities for cooperative ventures, projects, and 
      other efforts to make life considerably better for the citizens of both 
      countries. The history of U.S.–Canadian relations is filled with examples 
      of cooperative efforts in navigation, hydropower, agriculture, and 
      fisheries and of significant improvements in water 
      quality.<BR><BR>Diverting water from the Great Lakes has been an issue of 
      interest and at times controversy between the United States and Canada. 
      This issue, dating back to the 1800s, has been investigated by the 
      International Joint Commission most recently in the mid-1980s. In 1996, 
      the Commission advised both national governments that the subject of 
      diversion and consumptive use of Great Lakes waters needed to be addressed 
      more comprehensively than it had been to date.<BR><BR>In the light of 
      recent proposals to export water from the Great Lakes and other areas of 
      the United States and Canada, the governments decided to refer the issue 
      of water use along the border to the Commission. In a letter of February 
      10, 1999 (the "Reference"; see Appendix 1), the governments—after noting 
      that the number of proposals to use, divert, and remove greater amounts of 
      water that flow along or across the boundary is increasing—stated that 
      they were concerned that current management principles and conservation 
      measures may be inadequate to ensure the future sustainable use of shared 
      waters. Within this context, the governments requested the Commission to 
      examine, report upon, and provide recommendations on the following matters 
      that may affect levels and flows of waters within the boundary or 
      transboundary basins and shared aquifers:</P>

      <P>The Reference instructed the Commission, in preparing its 
      recommendations, to consider in general terms such matters as potential 
      effects on the environment and other interests of diversions and 
      consumptive uses and, where appropriate, the implications of 
      climatological trends and conditions.<BR><BR>The governments requested the 
      Commission to give first priority to an examination of the Great Lakes 
      Basin, focusing on the potential effects of bulk water removal, including 
      removals for export, and to provide interim recommendations for the 
      protection of the waters of the Great Lakes. The governments asked that 
      the interim recommendations covering the Great Lakes be submitted within 
      six months and that a final report be submitted six months later. The 
      Commission was asked to include in its final report advice on additional 
      work that may be required to better understand the implications of 
      consumption, diversion, and removal of water from boundary and 
      transboundary basins and from shared aquifers elsewhere along the 
      boundary.<BR><BR>In this report, "Great Lakes Basin" refers to the Great 
      Lakes, their connecting channels, and the international section of the St. 
      Lawrence River, together with their tributaries, and it also includes the 
      reach of the St. Lawrence River immediately downstream from the 
      international section of the river to the end of Lake St. Peter, excluding 
      the tributaries of this downstream reach (<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/figure1eng.jpg">Figure 
      1</A>). This is the same area the Commission addressed in its 1985 report, 
      Great Lakes Diversions and Consumptive Uses.<BR><BR>Immediately after 
      receiving the Reference, the Commission established a binational, 
      interdisciplinary study team to carry out the required investigations. An 
      equal number of members from each country were appointed to the team. They 
      were directed to work in the spirit of consensus in their personal and 
      professional capacities and not as representatives of their countries or 
      organizations. Members of the study team and IJC study participants are 
      listed in Appendix 2.<BR><BR>In August 1999, the Commission submitted to 
      the governments its Interim Report. The Commission recommended that, 
      pending submission of its Final Report under the Reference, federal, 
      state, and provincial governments should not authorize or permit any new 
      bulk sales or removals of surface water or groundwater from the Great 
      Lakes Basin and should continue to exercise caution with regard to 
      consumptive use of these waters. The Commission also offered other 
      recommendations and indicated it would discuss the recommendations with 
      the governments and the public.<BR><BR>The Commission has carried out a 
      broad public-consultation process and has made information related to work 
      on this Reference as widely available as practicable. A section on the 
      International Joint Commission web site (www.ijc.org) was created to 
      disseminate information and to encourage public discussion during the 
      study period. Eight public hearings were held throughout the Great Lakes 
      Basin in both countries in the latter half of March 1999, and 12 
      additional hearings were held in September and October (Appendix 3). In 
      addition to over 300 presentations made at these hearings, the Commission 
      received hundreds of other submissions in writing and by e-mail, primarily 
      from governments, interest groups, and individuals. The Commission also 
      consulted with federal, provincial, and state governments and regional and 
      other relevant sources, including a selection of experts convened at a 
      special workshop at the end of March 1999 and another workshop in 
      September 1999 (Appendix 4).<BR><BR>The majority of presentations from the 
      public supported the Commission's Interim Report but wanted the 
      recommendations to be strengthened to provide greater protection for the 
      waters of the Great Lakes Basin. There was general opposition to all forms 
      of bulk removals, although some presenters acknowledged the possibility of 
      exports to meet humanitarian needs. Many presenters believed that the 
      Interim Report understated the pressure that may arise in the future for 
      removal of water from the Great Lakes Basin. Many advocated adopting a 
      precautionary approach to removals, particularly in the light of future 
      uncertainties produced by, among other things, the possible impacts of 
      climate change. The hearings revealed widespread concern about water 
      quality issues, groundwater supplies, and the increasing trend to 
      privatization of water and sewage services. They also demonstrated that 
      there is support for conservation measures in the Basin. Aboriginal 
      Peoples and Indian tribes opposed water exports and were concerned that 
      removals or diversions could affect their treaty rights. <BR><BR>The 
      public hearings and written presentations revealed a profound concern on 
      the part of the public that international trade law could prevent proper 
      protection of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin. This view is not shared 
      by the Canadian and U. S. governments, and it is not supported by the 
      statements and writings of many experts in international trade law who 
      appeared before the Commission. These experts agreed that international 
      trade agreements do not prevent governments from protecting the waters of 
      the Great Lakes Basin. The public, however, remains deeply concerned that 
      international trade law could affect the protection of these waters. 
      <BR><BR>This Final Report is based on information the Commission had 
      before it when it prepared the Interim Report and on additional 
      information the Commission subsequently obtained from a variety of 
      sources, including the 12 public hearings held in September and October 
      1999. The Commission consulted government officials and experts on climate 
      change, cumulative impacts, and international trade and water law. 
      <BR><BR>There is little change from the Interim Report in Section 2— "The 
      Great Lakes System". Section 3—"Water Uses in the Great Lakes 
      Basin"—provides updated information on consumptive use and removals and 
      addresses concerns expressed at the recent public hearings with respect to 
      the possibility of future major diversions and the subject of 
      privatization.<BR><BR>Section 4—"Cumulative Effects"—reports on the 
      findings of an experts workshop on cumulative impacts (held in Windsor, 
      Ontario, in September 1999) and the study team's report on information 
      gathered with respect to the cumulative effects on the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem of factors affecting water levels and flows. Section 5— "Climate 
      Change"—provides more recent information on climate change 
      assessments.<BR><BR>Section 6—"Groundwater"—expands the discussion of 
      groundwater basins and their divides. Section 7—"Conservation"—expands on 
      the need for conservation in the Basin.<BR><BR>Section 8—"Legal and Policy 
      Considerations"—more fully addresses international trade law and U.S. 
      constitutional law issues and provides new information on domestic legal 
      developments in Canada and the United States.<BR><BR>Section 9 (a new 
      section) proposes a plan, as requested by the governments, for the 
      continuation of this study into the remainder of the boundary 
      region.<BR><BR>The Commission reviewed its conclusions and recommendations 
      in the Interim Report. Most conclusions remain the same, others have been 
      modified, and two have been added. Although the thrust of the final 
      recommendations parallels that of the interim report, some of the 
      recommendations in this report have been revised in the light of the 
      Commission's further consideration of the issues; some new recommendations 
      have also been added.<BR><BR>A glossary of terms used in this report is

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=2></A>Section 2 - The Great Lakes 
      System:</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>The Great Lakes Basin lies within eight states and two provinces and 
      comprises the lakes, connecting channels, tributaries, and groundwater 
      that drain through the international section of the St. Lawrence River. 
      The waters of the Great Lakes Basin are a critical part of the natural and 
      cultural heritage of the region, of Canada and the United States, and of 
      the global community. About 40 million people reside in the Basin itself<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. 
      Spanning over 1,200 km (750 mi.) from east to west, these freshwater seas 
      have made a vital contribution to the historical settlement, economic 
      prosperity, culture, and quality of life and to the diverse ecosystems of 
      the Basin and surrounding region.<BR><BR>The waters of the Great Lakes 
      have been a fundamental factor in placing the region among the world’s 
      leading locations in which to live and do business. Water contributes to 
      the health and well-being of all Basin residents, from its use in the home 
      to uses in manufacturing and industrial activity, in shipping and 
      navigation, in tourism and recreation, in energy production, and in 
      agriculture. The Great Lakes are, however, more than just a resource to be 
      consumed; they are also home to a great diversity of plants, animals, and 
      other biota. <BR><BR>The waters of the Great Lakes are, for the most part, 
      a nonrenewable resource. They are composed of numerous aquifers 
      (groundwater) that have filled with water over the centuries, waters that 
      flow in the tributaries of the Great Lakes, and waters that fill the lakes 
      themselves. Although the total volume in the lakes is vast, on average 
      less than 1 percent of the waters of the Great Lakes is renewed annually 
      by precipitation, surface water runoff, and inflow from groundwater 
      sources<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.<BR><BR>Lake 
      levels are determined by the combined influence of precipitation (the 
      primary source of natural water supply to the Great Lakes), upstream 
      inflows, groundwater, surface water runoff, evaporation, diversions into 
      and out of the system, consumptive use, dredging, and water level 
      regulation. Because of the vast water surface area, water levels of the 
      Great Lakes remain remarkably steady, with a normal fluctuation ranging 
      from 30 to 60 cm (12-24 in.) in a single year. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>Climatic conditions control precipitation (and thus groundwater 
      recharge), runoff, and direct supply to the lakes, as well as the rate of 
      evaporation. These are the primary driving factors in determining water 
      levels. With removals and in-Basin consumptive use remaining relatively 
      constant, during dry, hot-weather periods, inflow is decreased and 
      evaporation increased, resulting in lower lake levels and reduced flows. 
      During wet, colder periods, the opposite situation develops: higher levels 
      and increased flows. Between 1918 and 1998, there were several periods of 
      extremely high and extremely low water levels and flows. Exceptionally low 
      levels were experienced in the mid-1920s, mid-1930s, and early 1960s. High 
      levels occurred in 1929-30, 1952, 1973-74, 1985-86, and 1997-98. Studies 
      of water level fluctuations have shown that the Great Lakes can respond 
      relatively quickly to periods of above-average, below-average, or extreme 
      precipitation, water supply, and temperature conditions. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Great Lakes levels and lake level interests are highly sensitive to 
      climatic variability, as illustrated by the impact of high water levels in 
      the early 1950s and mid-1980s and of low water levels in the 1930s and 
      mid-1960s. Significant variability will continue whether or not 
      human-induced climate change is superimposed on natural fluctuations. An 
      example of how quickly water levels can change in response to climatic 
      conditions occurred during 1998-99, when the water levels of Lakes 
      Michigan-Huron dropped 57 cm (22 in.) in 12 months.<BR><BR>Studies have 
      concluded that the hydraulic characteristics of the Great Lakes system are 
      the result of both natural fluctuation and, to a lesser extent, human 
      intervention<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>3</SUP></A>. 
      Control works that are operated under the authority of the International 
      Joint Commission have been constructed in the St. Marys River at the 
      outlet of Lake Superior and in the St. Lawrence River below the outflow 
      from Lake Ontario. The level of Lake Erie has been increased by 
      obstructions in the Niagara River, including a number of fills on both 
      sides of the river, with a cumulative effect of about 12 cm (4.8 in.). 
      Dredging in the connecting channels has had a relatively significant 
      impact on lake levels, even in comparison to natural fluctuations. 
      Connecting channels and canals that have been dredged to facilitate 
      deep-draft shipping have permanently lowered Lakes Michigan—Huron by 
      approximately 40 cm (15.8 in.). Although dredging in the connecting 
      channels can have a significant effect, its impact is greatest on lakes 
      above the point of dredging, with downstream interests still receiving the 
      total amount of water flowing through the system. Out-of-basin diversions 
      or other removals and consumptive uses, by contrast, reduce water levels 
      both above and below the actual point of withdrawal and also reduce flows 
      in the system.<BR><BR>Diversions have been constructed to bring water into 
      the Great Lakes system from the Albany River system in northern Ontario at 
      Long Lac and Ogoki. They also have been constructed to take water out of 
      the system at Chicago and, to a much lesser extent, through the Erie 
      Canal. At present, more water is diverted into the system than is taken 
      out. A few other diversions on the border of the Basin move water in and 
      out of the Basin and have negligible effect. The volume of diversions out 
      of the Basin, of other removals, and of consumptive uses exceeds the 
      volume of water brought into the Basin by diversions and other artificial 
      means. Water is also diverted around Niagara Falls for hydroelectric power 
      generation, and water is diverted from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario through 
      the Welland Canal. <BR><BR>Groundwater is important to the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem because it provides a reservoir for storing water and for slowly 
      replenishing the Great Lakes through base flow in the tributaries and 
      through direct inflow to the lakes. Groundwater also serves as a source of 
      water for many human communities and provides moisture and sustenance to 
      plants and other biota.<BR><BR>The Great Lakes Basin is home to a diverse 
      range of fish, mammals, birds, and other biota. The interplay between 
      human activity and the natural order of the Lakes is complex and only 
      partially understood. Human activity is altering the biological diversity 
      and the socioeconomic structure of the Great Lakes Basin. Not only has 
      there been some loss of species in the Lakes, but there has also been the 
      introduction and establishment of alien invasive species like the lamprey 
      eel, the zebra mussel, and the goby fish through channels built to foster 
      transportation and electricity. Urbanization and farming have changed the 
      hydrology of the Lakes by reducing wetlands and other natural habitats and 
      by altering the speed at which runoff reaches the lakes<A

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=3></A>Section 3 - Water Uses in the Great 
      Lakes Basin</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>The Commission has conducted an examination of water use data in the 
      Great Lakes Basin. Water uses are presented in two categories: (1) 
      consumptive uses estimated from water withdrawal data and (2) removals. 
      Close to 90 percent of withdrawals are taken from the lakes themselves, 
      with the remaining 10 percent coming from tributary streams and 
      groundwater sources (<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/piechartsenglishA.jpg">Figure 
      2-A</A>)<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>5</SUP></A>.<BR><BR>In 
      its Interim Report issued in August 1999, the Commission used the most 
      current data that were available at that time for its analysis—1993 data 
      drawn from the Regional Water Use Data Base, maintained by the Great Lakes 
      Commission (GLC) on behalf of the Great Lakes states and provinces<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. 
      These data did not include consumptive use figures for the Chicago urban 
      area.<BR><BR>Since the Interim Report, the GLC has provided the Commission 
      with more recent water use data<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>7</SUP></A>. 
      Although most of these data are concentrated in the years 1994-98, not all 
      of the data fall into this time frame<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>8</SUP></A>. 
      Because the data span several years and the methods of data collection 
      vary from one jurisdiction to another, trend analysis and jurisdictional 
      comparison are difficult. In some instances, there are large differences 
      between the two sets of data in water use by sector presented by some 
      individual jurisdictions; the reasons for these differences are not always 
      clear. The Commission is of the view that analysis of the 1994-98 water 
      use data by sector and jurisdiction is of limited value. It decided to 
      focus instead on the overall aggregate Basin figures for withdrawals and 
      consumptive use, and compared these figures with the equivalent 1993 
      numbers, including Chicago consumption data.<BR><BR>The Commission also 
      looked at Great Lakes Basin water use data, extracted from national 
      databases compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<A

      For its five-year reports, the USGS analyzes state data, adjusts the data 
      to compensate for perceived deficiencies, and produces estimates of actual 
      water use for the year of the report. Environment Canada derives its 
      information from Statistics Canada surveys of major water users in the 
      Basin, not from provincial data. Environment Canada’s water use data tend 
      to be lower than data provided by the provinces to the GLC’s Regional 
      Water Use Data Base, since provincial data are generated from water 
      license permits as opposed to actual withdrawals. Like the USGS, 
      Environment Canada’s treatment of data is viewed as consistent over the 
      years. As with the 1994-98 GLC data, the Commission concentrated on Basin 
      aggregate numbers for withdrawals and consumptive use, mainly because of 
      the somewhat different water use sector category and classification 
      systems utilized by the two federal agencies. <BR><BR><A

      final report now reflect data for the Chicago urban area. The data 
      indicate a range for water use in the Great Lakes Basin. The percentage of 
      water consumed is approximately the same for all data sources, ranging 
      from 4.4 percent to 4.6 percent.<BR><BR><STRONG>Consumptive 
      Use</STRONG><BR><BR>For consumptive use, the Commission determined that 
      the 1993 data, now updated with the inclusion of full water use data for 
      Chicago, would be the basis for its final report. The Great Lakes 
      Commission stated that the 1993 data were sufficiently comprehensive and 
      consistent across all jurisdictions, were the product of a quality 
      assurance and control process by its committee of water resource managers, 
      and provided the best possible snapshot of water use in the 
      Basin.<BR><BR>In 1993, consumptive use in the Great Lakes Basin was 
      estimated to be 121 cms (4,270 cfs) as compared to a withdrawal of about 
      2,493 cms (88,060 cfs) (<A

      <P>The percentage of withdrawn water that is consumed within the Great 
      Lakes system varies with the type of use to which the water is put. When 
      water is used for irrigation, over 70 percent is consumed<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>11</SUP></A>. 
      At the other extreme, when water is used for thermoelectric power, less 
      than 1 percent is consumed. The percentage of water lost to the Basin when 
      it is used for public supply and for industrial purposes—other large 
      water-using categories—is of the order of 10 percent for each (<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/barchartenglish.jpg">Figure 
      3</A>). As previously indicated the average consumption rate, considering 
      all types of uses, is approximately 5 percent. <BR><BR>Consumptive use 
      data for groundwater are not available for most jurisdictions. Groundwater 
      withdrawal in the Great Lakes Basin is estimated to be generally between 3 
      percent and 5 percent of the total water withdrawal in the Basin. This 
      figure, however, greatly understates the importance of groundwater to the 
      Basin population. The USGS estimates that over 8 million people on the 
      U.S. side of the border rely on groundwater as their source of drinking 
      water, and groundwater is the most common source of bottled water. The 
      effects of groundwater withdrawal may therefore be of concern on a local 
      or subregional basis, particularly with respect to urban sprawl, even if 
      withdrawals do not have a major impact on the overall water budget of the 
      Basin<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>12</SUP></A>. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>The Commission has developed insights into trends in water use and 
      their impact on potential future water demands. These insights were 
      derived from a simple extension of trends established over the previous 
      decade. The variability in existing data complicates not only analysis of 
      past and present trends, but also the task of predicting the future. All 
      predictions are heavily dependent on the assumptions underlying them and 
      on an accurate understanding of the present starting point. Factors such 
      as climate change could encourage the increased use of water for 
      irrigation and other purposes. On the other hand, continued improvement in 
      water demand management as well as in water conservation might help to 
      slow any increase in withdrawals for consumptive use within the Basin. 
      Because population will increase, there is a greater probability of 
      increasing use in the future than there is of decreasing use. Projections 
      presented below extend to 2020. The Commission believes that water use is 
      likely to increase modestly by 2020 and that projections beyond this point 
      should be considered highly speculative.<BR><BR><EM>Thermoelectric Power 
      Use.</EM> At thermoelectric power plants, water is used principally for 
      condenser and reactor cooling. In the United States, thermoelectric 
      withdrawals have remained relatively constant since 1985 and are expected 
      to remain near their current levels for the next few decades. In Canada, 
      modest increases are expected to continue along with population and 
      economic growth.<BR><BR><EM>Industrial and Commercial Use.</EM> In the 
      United States, industrial and commercial water use has declined in 
      response to environmental pollution legislation, technological advances, 
      and a change in the industrial mix from heavy metal production to more 
      service-oriented sectors. A similar trend is evident in Ontario, so 
      combined use is expected to gradually decline through 2020. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR><EM>Domestic and Public Use</EM>. In the United States, water use for 
      domestic and public purposes in the Great Lakes Basin generally increased 
      from 1960 to 1995 and is expected to climb gradually through 2020. In 
      Ontario, however, the modest downward trend established in recent years 
      because of water conservation efforts is expected to 
      continue.<BR><BR><EM>Agriculture.</EM> In the United States, water use for 
      agriculture in the Great Lakes region increased fairly steadily from 1960 
      to 1995 and is expected to continue to grow. In Canada, the rate of 
      increase was somewhat greater, so that combined projections indicate a 
      significant increase by 2020. Climate change could increase even further 
      the competitive advantage in agriculture the Basin has as a result of its 
      relative abundance of water. <BR><BR><EM>Total Water Use.</EM> There is 
      agreement that water withdrawal will increase in the future, although it 
      is impossible to say with confidence just how much the increase will be<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>13</SUP></A>. 
      There is, however, no such agreement on consumptive use. For 
      example:<BR></P>

              of the Basin, and by 25 percent in the whole Basin.<BR>

              Canadian section of 1 percent, and in the total Basin of 3

      conveyed outside their basin of origin by any means. The following 
      paragraphs discuss current removals by diversion, other types of removals

      potential for future diversions and other removals. Some past diversion 
      and removal proposals are summarized in Appendix 6.<BR><BR><EM>Current

      Corps of Engineers, has averaged 3,439 cfs (97 cms), which is 239 cfs (6.9 
      cms) more than the U.S. Supreme Court limit of 3,200 cfs (91 cms). 
      Pursuant to the 1996 Memorandum of Understanding, the state of Illinois 
      has agreed to repay the cumulative flow deficit by the year 2019.

      Superior.<BR><BR>At present, more water is diverted into the Great Lakes 
      Basin through the Long Lac and Ogoki diversions than is diverted out of 
      the Basin at Chicago and by several small diversions in the United States. 
      If the Long Lac and Ogoki diversions were not in place, water levels would

      <BR>Aside from these major diversions, there are also a few small 
      diversions<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>15</SUP></A>. 
      Three were implemented in the 19th century to facilitate waterborne 
      commerce between the Great Lakes and neighboring drainage basins. These 
      are the Forestport, New York, diversion of water from the Black River 
      tributary of Lake Ontario into the Erie Canal and Hudson River basin; the 
      Portage Canal diverting Wisconsin River water from the Mississippi River 
      system into the Lake Michigan basin; and the Ohio and Erie Canal diverting 
      water from the Ohio River basin into the uyahoga River of the Lake Erie 
      basin. All three are now used primarily for recreational 
      purposes.<BR><BR>In recent years, London, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan 
      have taken water from Lake Huron for municipal purposes, discharging their 
      effluent to Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, respectively. The Raisin 
      River Conservation Authority in Ontario has, with the approval of the 
      Commission, taken water from the international section of the St. Lawrence 
      River to maintain summer flows in the Raisin River. Ohio has reported very 
      small diversions in Lorain County and the City of Ravenna, both 
      communities whose customers straddle the Lake Erie–Ohio basin divide. The 
      information in this section covers the diversions of which the Commission 
      is aware. There may be others.<BR><BR>Two U.S. communities —Pleasant 
      Prairie, Wisconsin, which lies outside the Basin, and Akron, Ohio, whose 
      water district straddles the Great Lakes Basin divide— have obtained 
      permission under U.S. law (the Water Resources Development Act of 1986) to 
      take water from the Great Lakes on the condition that they return an 
      equivalent volume of water over time to the Basin. In 1988, the Great 
      Lakes governors approved the Pleasant Prairie Diversion and agreed that a 
      like amount of water would be returned to the Lake Michigan Basin by 2005. 
      Although this diversion was below the consultation trigger amount in the 
      Great Lakes Charter, Ontario and Quebec were consulted. Quebec concurred, 
      but Ontario did not. The diversion was implemented. After 2005, the 
      diversion would provide “no net loss” to Lake Michigan. With respect to 
      Akron, the governors approved; Ontario concurred, and Quebec did not 
      object. The state of Ohio has already increased the flow of water into the 
      Cuyahoga River from the Ohio/Portage system to support the Akron 
      Diversion, and there is no loss of water to the Great Lakes from this 
      diversion.<BR><BR>In addition to these diversions in and out of the Great 
      Lakes Basin, the Welland and Erie Canals divert water between subbasins of 
      the Great Lakes and are considered intrabasin diversions<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>17</SUP></A>. 
      In 1997, another small intrabasin diversion was built from Hamilton to the 
      Haldimand region in Ontario.<BR><BR><EM>Other Removals.</EM> Public 
      concern has been focused on the potential movement of freshwater in bulk 
      beyond the Great Lakes Basin by ocean tankers. To date, no contracts are 
      in place, and no regular trade has begun to ship water in bulk from the 
      Great Lakes Basin or from North America as a whole<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>18</SUP></A>. 
      For almost two decades, however, entrepreneurs have actively pursued 
      foreign markets and have sought approval to export from jurisdictions on 
      both the west and east coasts. When the Interim Report was written, 
      Alaska, Newfoundland, and Quebec were considering proposals to export 
      freshwater in bulk by ocean tankers, although both Newfoundland and Quebec 
      have since moved to prohibit such exports subject to exceptions described 
      in Section 8 of this report.<BR><BR>The Commission has learned that one 
      exporter in Alaska was shipping a small volume of water, 378,500 liters 
      per week (100,000 gallons/week). The Commission understands that orders 
      for Alaskan water have fallen significantly since the beginning of 1999. 
      The water is placed in containers that are barged to Washington state, 
      where the water is bottled. It is then shipped to Alaska, Taiwan, and 
      Korea. Although it seems clear that climate change and continued reports 
      of worldwide water shortages will continue to keep discussion of bulk 
      water shipments alive, the cost of such shipments makes it unlikely that 
      there will be serious efforts to take Great Lakes water to foreign 
      markets, and cost will continue to serve as an impediment to bulk 
      shipments from coastal waters. Thus far, companies in these jurisdictions 
      have captured only small markets for bottled water.<BR><BR>Analysis of the 
      bottled water industry indicates that when intrabasin trade in bottled 
      water is subtracted from the total trade, the Basin imports about 14 times 
      more bottled water than it exports— 141 million liters (37 million 
      gallons) in 1998 imported vs. 10 million liters (2.6 million gallons) 
      exported. At this time, bottled water appears to have no effect on water 
      levels in the Great Lakes Basin as a whole, although there could be local 
      effects in and around the withdrawal sites<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>19</SUP></A>.<BR><BR>Trade 
      in other types of beverages is believed to be of a similar order of 
      magnitude<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>20</SUP></A>. 
      For example, 272 million liters (72 million gallons) of bottled water were 
      exported in 1998 from all of Canada to the United States. That represented 
      33 percent of all beverage exports from Canada to the United States that 
      year, compared with 44 percent for beer and 19 percent for soft drinks. 
      Considering the extremely small magnitude of trade in bottled water and 
      other beverages, it would appear both impractical and unnecessary to treat 
      bottled water and other beverages any differently than any other products 
      that either include water or use water in their production 
      processes.<BR><BR>In July 1999, there was a flurry of media interest in 
      the bottled water situation in Ontario. According to media reports, the 
      Ontario government had issued permits authorizing the withdrawal of 18 
      billion liters (4.8 billion gallons) of water per year for bottling 
      purposes, almost all from groundwater sources. Only about 4 percent of 
      this volume is currently being withdrawn, amounting to a flow of 0.02 cms 
      (0.7 cfs), and Ontario is reviewing whether groundwater supplies are 
      adequate to satisfy the licenses that it has issued to bottling companies. 
      It appears that most of this water remains within the Great Lakes Basin. 
      While the Commission is sensitive to the potential importance of this 
      matter to local groundwater regimes, at this time the Commission believes 
      that this is not a significant issue with respect to the level of Great 
      Lakes waters and that local effects can be managed best at the local 
      level. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Ballast water, which is used to 
      stabilize vessels, has always been considered a noncommercial item. No 
      evidence has been found to suggest that any ballast water taken from the 
      Great Lakes Basin is sold abroad. It should be noted that water quality is 
      not an issue for the purpose of establishing ballast, but discharging 
      ballast water can lead to the introduction of alien invasive species. A 
      number of these species are now prevalent throughout the Great Lakes 
      Basin. Over a recent nine-year period, the net loss of water from the 
      Great Lakes Basin as a result of ships taking on ballast water in the 
      lakes was equivalent to an average annual flow of 0.02 cms (0.7 cfs)<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>21</SUP></A>.<BR><BR><EM>Potential 
      for Future Diversions and Removals</EM>. Many speakers at the public 
      hearings on the Interim Report said the Commission too readily dismissed 
      the threat of major diversions from the Great Lakes to other regions, 
      especially the Southwestern states. They indicated that while an analysis 
      of past proposals for mega-diversions indicates that they may not have 
      been feasible, at least from an economic standpoint, this does not mean 
      that proposals of this kind could never be pursued for economic or other 
      reasons. While the Commission acknowledges the anxiety expressed by some 
      at the hearings, the Commission continues to believe that the era of major 
      diversions and water transfers in the United States and Canada has ended. 
      Barring significant climate change, an overcoming of engineering problems 
      and of numerous economic and social issues, and an abandonment of national 
      environmental ethics, the call for such diversions and transfers will not 
      return. At present, there do not appear to be any active proposals for 
      major diversion projects either into or out of the Basin. There is little 
      reason to believe that such projects will become economically, 
      environmentally, and socially feasible in the foreseeable future. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>In the United States, the era of major diversions and water transfers 
      was linked to the transcontinental movement of population and industry, 
      which fostered a dynamic of resource exploitation to support new 
      settlements and new economic activity. In the western United States, 
      engineers created, at tremendous cost, networks of dams, reservoirs, and 
      canals to harvest water sources to support power generation, irrigation, 
      human consumption, and sanitation. As the west moves into the 21st 
      century, concerns are turning to ecosystem restoration and environmental 
      remediation, and sustainable management has begun to guide regional 
      planning principles.<BR><BR>The mega-projects that have already been 
      completed targeted the most easily accessible areas. Future 
      mega-diversions would present many additional engineering challenges. 
      Although most of these challenges could be overcome, the costs of such 
      projects, whether by pipeline or channel, remain enormous. Not only must 
      capital be invested in the construction of the project, but also operating 
      and maintenance funds must be found to support the effort. Every study of 
      such projects has highlighted the high energy costs associated with the 
      pumping of water over topographic barriers. Mega-diversions also require 
      rights-of-way for their passage and security for the products being 
      transported, which would be difficult to obtain. The environmental costs 
      of such projects in terms of disruption of habitat and species movement 
      are enormous. A project similar to the current California Aqueduct would 
      represent 75 percent of the current consumptive use in the Great Lakes 
      Basin and would, prima facie, have a major environmental impact on aquatic 
      and terrestrial resources. Increasingly, water managers recognize the 
      validity of pricing water at its true value, making it far more cost 
      effective to increase the available supply of water by using existing 
      supplies more efficiently as they are allocated among basin 
      interests.<BR><BR>The 1998 Report of the Western Water Policy Review 
      Advisory Commission<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
      confirmed earlier expert analysis that Western states have options for 
      water that are less expensive and less open to legal challenge than 
      long-distance import of water from the Columbia, Missouri–Mississippi, or 
      Great Lakes basins. The population of the Western states is continuing to 
      grow faster than the national average. It is an urban population and may 
      be able to afford to buy and lease existing water rights from the 
      less-productive agricultural sector. Water savings are already being 
      realized by some cities in the Southwest as a result of conservation 
      measures and improved irrigation practices. The fact that agriculture 
      still accounts for almost 80 percent of water withdrawals in Western 
      states, most of it for low-value crops like alfalfa and corn, indicates 
      that there will continue to be significant opportunities for reallocation 
      of existing supplies for the foreseeable future. <BR><BR>Even if 
      mega-diversions were technically and economically feasible, current water 
      management thinking recognizes that the political difficulties of managing 
      water effectively increase as one moves beyond a single basin. Although it 
      can be very difficult to do so effectively, those who share a basin 
      generally recognize the importance of working together to manage both 
      excess and shortfall, as well as water quality. Agreeing to cooperate 
      across both political boundaries and basin divides is even more difficult, 
      and it would be impossible for Great Lakes jurisdictions to guarantee an 
      uninterruptible supply to a non-Basin consumer of water. Some interests in 
      the Great Lakes Basin, such as riparian homeowners, might welcome a means 
      of removing water from the Basin during periods of extremely high levels. 
      Most interests, including in-stream interests, commercial navigation, and 
      recreational boating, would be adamantly opposed to such removals in 
      periods of low levels. Diversions during droughts would, however, be 
      difficult to interrupt because of the dependency that diversions create 
      among recipients. The Commission recognizes that once a diversion to a 
      water-poor area is permitted, it would be very difficult to shut it off at 
      some time in the future. <BR><BR>The Chicago Diversion, where 
      infrastructure already exists, is a possible exception to the technical 
      and economic impediments to additional major diversions. There were 
      expressions of anxiety in public hearings about this possibility, which 
      would, of course, lower Lakes Michigan–Huron and the downstream system, 
      impair navigation, and reduce hydroelectric power generation in the 
      Niagara and St. Lawrence Rivers. In fact, during a period of high water in 
      the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s, a Commission study team evaluated the 
      possibility of increasing the Chicago Diversion to reduce water levels. 
      Shortly thereafter, there were calls, during a period of low water in the 
      Mississippi River Basin, to increase the diversion for a limited period to 
      ease navigation difficulties on the Mississippi River. In the 1980s, 
      further diversions from the Great Lakes were reviewed, including the 
      possibility of increasing the Chicago Diversion to replace water diverted 
      from the Arkansas River Basin to help replenish the Ogallala aquifer<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>23</SUP></A>. 
      In all cases, it was determined that such diversions would either not 
      achieve the intended objectives or were too expensive to be practical. Any 
      effort to increase the diversion in periods of either high or low water 
      would have to overcome potential opposition from some downstream 
      Mississippi Basin states and from Canada, the reluctance of any Great 
      Lakes states to allow any increase in the diversion lest it become 
      permanent, and the need for U.S. Supreme Court approval. <BR><BR>The 
      Chicago Diversion was designed for a flow of 10,000 cfs (283 cms). When 
      the Boundary Waters Treaty was signed in 1909, the U.S. government had 
      already limited the Chicago Diversion to 4,167 cfs (118 cms)<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>24</SUP></A>. 
      Subsequent urban development limits the diversion to 8,700 cfs (246 cms); 
      flows above this level will damage property along the diversion.<BR><BR>In 
      the short run, pressures for small removals via diversion or pipeline are 
      most likely to come from growing communities in the United States just 
      outside the Great Lakes Basin divide where there are shortages of water 
      and available water is of poor quality. The cost of building the 
      structures needed to support such diversions would be relatively small by 
      comparison to the cost of building structures to move water vast 
      distances. Population distribution<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>25</SUP></A> 
      suggests that several communities that straddle or are near the Great 
      Lakes Basin divide, particularly communities in Ohio, Indiana, and 
      Wisconsin, may look to the Great Lakes for a secure source of municipal 
      and industrial water supplies in the future. Such diversions would require 
      the approval of the Great Lakes governors under the Water Resources 
      Development Act of 1986 (WRDA), and they would fall within the provisions 
      of the Great Lakes Charter. The only diversions approved in the United 
      States under WRDA procedures to date have resulted in no net loss of water 
      to the Great Lakes Basin. In Ontario, because of geography, there are 
      currently no such pressures along the border of the Basin to draw on Great 
      Lakes water, nor are there likely to be any in the future. <BR><BR>At a 
      lesser level, water may be transferred in bulk by trucks or marine 
      tankers. Because water is heavy, it is expensive to move. The geography of 
      the region and the inability of the St. Lawrence Seaway to handle large 
      tankers are such that the commercial viability of long-distance trade in 
      bulk water from the Great Lakes appears uneconomical. Moreover, other 
      countries with abundant water supplies are located much closer to 
      prospective foreign markets than are the Great Lakes. Even the 
      California–Mexico border region could be served more effectively from the 
      Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Panama than from diversions or ocean 
      tankers drawing water from the Great Lakes, and there are more readily 
      accessible sources of water on the East Coast of North 
      America.<BR><BR>Towing large fabric bags filled with water is a variation 
      on freshwater export by ocean tanker. This technique has been used since 
      late 1997 to provide water from the mainland to some of the Greek islands 
      and to the Turkish part of Cyprus<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>26</SUP></A>. 
      Apparently, these short-haul arrangements in the Mediterranean have 
      reduced the cost of delivery to under $1 U.S. per cubic meter, but the 
      limited capacity of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system and longer ocean 
      distances may rule out the use of this technology in the Great Lakes 
      Basin.<BR><BR>The difficulty and the expense of moving water in bulk are 
      forcing water managers around the world to place greater emphasis on the 
      efficient use of existing local sources. Treated domestic and industrial 
      wastewaters are being used for many purposes, including lawn watering and 
      agricultural irrigation. As demand for urban water supplies increases, 
      communities are seeking to manage their demands rather than increase their 
      supplies. In some areas, implementation of conservation techniques has 
      reduced demand by as much as 50 percent. In other areas, water rights 
      markets have shifted available water from agricultural to urban uses. 
      <BR><BR>Desalination is another promising alternative to long-distance 
      diversion (or shipment) of water. Santa Barbara chose during the 
      California drought a decade ago to build a desalination plant in order to 
      guarantee a reliable supply of water in preference to importing water by 
      tanker and/or reducing system-wide use. More recently, Quebec has 
      concluded that in most instances, the cost of desalination would be about 
      half that of transporting freshwater long distances by ship. By late 2002, 
      Tampa, Florida, will begin blending desalinated water with freshwater at 
      costs that are competitive with the costs of developing new freshwater 
      sources. Desalination technology is improving rapidly. Hybrid desalination 
      systems, which combine thermal and membrane filtration, are lowering costs 
      significantly, and throughout the world, new desalination projects worth 
      billions of dollars are scheduled to come on-line over the next two 
      decades<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>27</SUP></A>.<BR><BR><EM>Privatization.</EM> 
      It is evident from the Commission’s public hearings that many people are 
      concerned about the growing trend toward private sector involvement in 
      water utilities worldwide. Privatization incorporates a spectrum of 
      private–public relationships such as entirely private, private with public 
      oversight, and private management contracts. Governments are divesting 
      themselves of their investments and services in order to promote capital 
      inflow, efficiency, and solvency<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>28</SUP></A>. 
      For example, Milwaukee, Toronto, Hamilton–Wentworth, and other cities in 
      the Great Lakes Basin are involving the private sector in water or 
      wastewater systems. Private sector involvement may lead to efficiencies, 
      improved technology, improved customer service, and reduced cost<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>29</SUP></A>. 
      In addition, other benefits include conservation, improved adherence to 
      local and federal regulations, and increased spending on research and 
      development. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      However, public divestiture of utilities may have its disadvantages. The 
      public raised concerns that profit-oriented private firms may act at the 
      expense of the public since profits are directly related to high rates of 
      consumption, lower expenditures, and/or higher rates in the water services 
      industry. Also, there is some evidence that companies may be more lax on 
      public and environmental safety standards to increase profits because 
      there is little regulation and public accountability<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>30</SUP></A>. 
      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      An increasing amount of privatization will require that attention be paid 
      to government regulations and their enforcement to ensure that public 
      goals with respect to such matters as high water quality, other aspects of 
      environmental quality, conservation, equity, and efficiency are fully 
      satisfied. This includes ensuring that public and private sector water 
      managers are held accountable for the achievement of these public goals 
      and for protection of public health.</P>

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=4></A>Section 4 - Cumulative 
      Effects</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>Human intervention has affected the Great Lakes ecosystem at the local 
      level as well as at the system-wide level, and the effects (impacts) are 
      both short-term and long-term. The Commission has identified the basic 
      physical (abiotic or nonliving) impacts of human use and activity on the 
      current water levels in the Basin and has worked to identify the ensuing 
      impacts of these and possible future changes on the living components of 
      the ecosystem. Human interventions (withdrawals, consumptive uses, 
      regulation, dredging, land use, etc.) are inherently cumulative. The 
      impact of localized, small-scale activities may be difficult to quantify 
      on an individual basis but, collectively, they can significantly alter the 
      level and flow regime and associated ecological 
      conditions.<BR><BR>Existing consumptive uses have lowered the levels of 
      the Great Lakes from less than 1 cm (0.4 in.) to 6 cm (2.4 in.) (<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/cummulativeeng.jpg">Table 
      3</A>). This impact has been far exceeded by other anthropogenic 
      activities. The inflows from the Long Lac and Ogoki Diversions have raised 
      lake levels, and the outflows from inter- and intrabasin diversions have 
      lowered lake levels. The largest human-induced impact on lake levels has 
      come from the channel work on the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers; this 
      dredging and mining for gravel has lowered the levels of Lakes Michigan 
      and Huron by 40 cm (15.8 in.). The Commission's orders of approval 
      governing the operations of the structures on the St. Marys and St. 
      Lawrence Rivers have established desirable ranges for levels in Lakes 
      Superior and Ontario to avoid very low or very high levels and the 
      consequent impacts that very low and very high levels have on Great Lakes 
      interests.<BR><BR>There is interaction among these changes, bringing about 
      cumulative impacts. Cumulative impacts in ecosystems involve past, 
      present, and reasonably foreseeable effects that are seldom simply the sum 
      of the changes. Even modest changes induced by individual, discrete 
      actions have incremental and other cumulative impacts on both a localized 
      and system-wide basis. These implications become more pronounced as one 
      proceeds downstream through the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence 
      system.<BR><BR>Although changes to lake levels and outflows are relatively 
      easy to determine, the impact of these changes is subject to 
      interpretation. The impacts of the changes in levels on the ecosystem as a 
      whole, and especially on its lake and river subsystems, are not well 
      understood. For example, construction of the power and navigation projects 
      on the St. Lawrence River in the late 1950s forever changed the character 
      of the river. Some argue that the environmental changes brought about by 
      the project have done incalculable harm. Others have built their lives on 
      the basis of the new river–lake system and would be devastated by a return 
      to pre-project conditions. In fact, the overall effects of the changed 
      regime have not been fully assessed.<BR><BR>The Commission is aware of 
      only one assessment of the overall effects of water diversions. In 1979 
      the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an assessment of a major 
      increase in the Chicago Diversion on the Great Lakes<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>31</SUP></A>. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>Experts participating in a Commission workshop on cumulative impacts 
      concluded that it is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
      the ecological impacts of most water withdrawals, consumptive uses, and 
      removals<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>32</SUP></A>. 
      In particular, impact assessment data and information are lacking with 
      respect to fisheries productivity and composition, the extent and range of 
      coastal wetlands, near-shore water quality, habitat and the degree of 
      slope lakeward of the habitat, and biodiversity. <BR><BR>The dynamic 
      nature of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system and the multiplicity of 
      physical, chemical, and biological processes affecting ecosystem status 
      challenge science's ability to establish and characterize causal 
      relationships between a given water use and its impact on levels, flows, 
      and fluctuations, on any observed changes in the ecosystem, and on 
      economic uses of the system. These challenges will always be difficult to 
      deal with, and additional research clearly is warranted in several areas<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>33</SUP></A>.<BR><BR>It 
      is unlikely that cumulative assessment tools will ever be able to deal 
      comprehensively with all the uncontrollable and unknown factors and all 
      the uncertainties, surprises, and complex, nonlinear interrelationships 
      that are inherent in a vast ecosystem. Nevertheless, efforts to conduct 
      such assessments must continue.<BR><BR>Given the uncertainties associated 
      with future climate change, consumptive use, and possible pressures for 
      removals, and given the additional uncertainties associated with impact 
      assessment methodologies, a precautionary approach is appropriate. Toward 
      this end, consideration should be given to policies that are well advised 
      from an ecological and economic standpoint irrespective of climate change 
      or unforeseen demands. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>A literature review conducted in conjunction with the experts workshop 
      provided key findings from studies related to assessment of impacts of 
      changes in water levels and a listing of methodologies that could be 
      useful in assessing impacts of changes in water levels. Through the 
      literature review, it became evident that meaningful assessments have been 
      limited by unavailability of information and by a lack of science to 
      support analysis. Meaningful assessments are also limited by an inability 
      to go beyond assessment of individual impacts. The literature review 
      pointed out the uncertainties associated with conducting assessments and 
      the variety of challenges faced in determining the appropriate methodology 
      to be used.<BR><BR>For the 21st century, there is a great deal of 
      uncertainty regarding factors such as future consumptive use, small-scale 
      removals of water, and climate change. Despite this uncertainty, present 
      indications are that all three factors are likely to place downward 
      pressures on water levels, with reinforcing impacts. Although there are 
      insufficient data and inadequate scientific understanding to place precise 
      estimates on the magnitude and timing of such impacts, the impacts could 
      be significant. This—and the prospect of adverse cumulative impact of new 
      human interventions—suggests a need for great caution in dealing with 
      those water use factors that are within the control of Basin managers.</P>

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=5></A>Section 5 - Climate 
      Change</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>Two decades after the 1979 World Climate Conference, there is still 
      considerable debate over how fast human-induced climate change will take 
      place, how extreme it will be, how dangerous such changes will be for 
      ecosystems, including socioeconomic systems, and just how aggressively the 
      global community should seek to mitigate the issue. There are, however, 
      some points of consensus. The rate of increase in concentrations of 
      greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is related to human activity, and, at a 
      minimum, a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere 
      will occur in the 21st century, with a corresponding increase in the 
      average global temperature of 1–4 degrees C. There is also a reasonably 
      strong consensus that the science is sound and that "the balance of 
      evidence suggests there is discernible human influence on the climate 
      system."<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>34</SUP></A><BR><BR>In 
      recent decades, scientists have become increasingly concerned about 
      changes taking place in the atmosphere, particularly the increasing 
      concentrations of greenhouse gases. There is growing evidence that the 
      changing composition of the atmosphere is beginning to influence specific 
      components of the hydrologic cycle, even though it is not yet possible to 
      differentiate such effects from the natural variability of Great Lakes 
      levels. Over the past several decades, trends in hydrologic variables in 
      the Basin and in the vicinity of the Basin have generally been consistent 
      with changes projected by and inferred from climate models, in terms of 
      increases in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation. Although it is 
      not yet possible to differentiate such effects from the natural 
      variability of climate, these research results are generally what would be 
      expected with "enhanced greenhouse effect" warming.<BR><BR>Results from 
      computer climate models have been used to explore impacts on various 
      water-related interests, assuming likely scenarios of future atmospheric 
      greenhouse gas concentrations and, in some cases, sulfate aerosol 
      concentrations. The information from these models has been used to develop 
      climate scenarios that have been input to hydrologic models. Early impact 
      assessments, based on equilibrium 2 x CO2 scenarios, suggest global 
      warming will result in a lowering of water supplies and lake levels and in 
      a reduction of outflows from the Basin. Based on projections using several 
      state-of-the-art models<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>35</SUP></A>, 
      experts from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
      (NOAA) and Environment Canada believe that global warming could result in 
      a lowering of lake level regimes by up to a meter or more by the middle of 
      the 21st century, a development that would cause severe economic, 
      environmental, and social impacts throughout the Great Lakes region. 
      <BR><BR>Experts associated with the U.S. National Assessment on the 
      Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change indicate the 
      possibility of both slightly increased and decreased lake levels as a 
      result of their analysis of climate models. The National Assessment is 
      focusing on two transient, coupled atmosphere– ocean general circulation 
      models<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>36</SUP></A> 
      (GCMs) that generally result in increased precipitation and temperature in 
      North America as a whole, although one more dramatically than the other, 
      in the long run (2090)<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>37</SUP></A>. 
      Of particular note, these two models reach different projected outcomes in 
      2030 and 2090 for net supplies and water levels in the Great Lakes Basin<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>38</SUP></A>. 
      Given the large discrepancies in some results of the models, there 
      continues to be a high degree of uncertainty associated with the magnitude 
      of potential changes. <BR><BR>Many analysts recognize that results from 
      the analysis of general circulation models indicate that global warming 
      will change global precipitation patterns, with different amounts of 
      rainfall over the course of the year. Warmer conditions may also lead to 
      more precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow; less snow cover 
      and shorter duration of both snow and ice cover; earlier snow melt; more 
      runoff in winter; and a greater likelihood of less runoff in summer 
      because of higher evaporation and the earlier onset of spring melt, with 
      less runoff because of less snow pack. Many analysts believe that there 
      will be increased frequency of heavy, short-duration rains in some regions 
      interspersed with dry spells, and more pronounced droughts. All these 
      factors indicate a shift in the peak volume and timing of rainfall and 
      runoff, which may change the timing of increases and decreases of lake 
      water levels. Thus, areas that receive roughly the same amount of total 
      annual precipitation could be forced to alter water management practice 
      significantly to take into account large changes in seasonal patterns of 
      precipitation. <BR><BR>The question with respect to average Great Lakes 
      levels is whether, in the long term, increases in evaporation due to 
      global warming will significantly offset increases in precipitation, 
      thereby reducing net water supplies. It is impossible at this time to 
      conclusively differentiate shorter-term natural variability from any 
      longer-term trend in the historical record. Great Lakes levels and lake 
      level interests are highly sensitive to climatic variability, as 
      illustrated by the impact of high water levels in the early 1950s and the 
      mid-1980s and of low water levels in the 1930s and the mid-1960s. 
      Significant variability will continue whether or not human-induced 
      climatic change is superimposed on these natural fluctuations. From a 
      policy perspective, this uncertainty does not alter the risk posed by 
      climate change.<BR><BR>Climate change suggests that some lowering of water 
      levels is likely to occur. The Commission's study team examined the 
      subject of changing water levels and found that the effects of high water 
      levels have been dealt with in the recent past<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>39</SUP></A>. 
      However, should lower water levels occur, the factors noted below may be 
      indicative of some of the impacts that could be significant for the 
      economy, the social fabric, and the natural environment of the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>40</SUP></A>. 
      It should be noted that adaptation measures would moderate some of these

      <P>The analysis of the general circulation models suggests that a notable

      studies is the timing of the change in lake levels and connecting channel 
      flows. There is a need for further research to help predict future weather 
      and climate with more certainty and for impact assessments that define the 
      vulnerability. The continually developing research would provide water 
      managers with information so they may address coping mechanisms—such as 
      developing water management plans to handle extremes—that alleviate the 
      possible wide range of climate change effects. At a minimum, 
      cost-effective measures should be taken that would modify those human 
      activities that contribute to changes in climate and other unsustainable 
      environmental impacts on resources. <BR><BR>Although uncertainty is 
      inherent in climate models, it should not be assumed that climate change 
      impacts on the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem would take place gradually over 
      the next several decades. Human-induced climate change will be 
      superimposed on normal climate variability and natural events like El 
      Niño/La Niña. The timing and regional patterns of precipitation and runoff 
      could change and have a dramatic effect on water levels and outflows. In 
      summary, the Commission believes that considerable caution should be 
      exercised with respect to any factors potentially reducing water levels 
      and outflows.</P>

      Groundwater</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>Groundwater is an important source of water for many segments of the 
      Great Lakes community. Humans use groundwater primarily for public supply 
      and for irrigation, industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes. Some 
      members of the biotic community—for example, cave-dwelling fish, 
      cave-dwelling crayfish, cave-dwelling insects, some kinds of funguses, and 
      some microorganisms—spend all their lives underground and are completely 
      dependent upon groundwater. Additionally, the vadose zone (the 
      occasionally saturated permeable substrate) is home to a number of 
      organisms—many of them microorganisms—that emerge from dormancy during 
      periods of water saturation and return to dormancy during periods of 
      dessication.<BR><BR>Recent U.S. studies have estimated that groundwater 
      makes a significant contribution to the overall water supply in the Great 
      Lakes Basin43. Indirect groundwater discharge accounts for approximately 
      22 percent of the U.S. supply to Lake Erie, 33 percent of the supply to 
      Lake Superior, 35 percent of the supply to Lake Michigan, and 42 percent 
      of the supply to Lakes Huron and Ontario (<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/groundwater.jpg">Figure 
      5</A>). Over most of Ontario, the contribution of groundwater to stream 
      flow is less than 20 percent; this is because of the predominance of silt 
      and clay or poorly fractured bedrock at the surface. However, in some 
      portions of the Lake Erie and Lake Ontario basins, where sand and gravel 
      are found at the surface, the contribution of groundwater to local streams 
      can be as high as 60 percent or more.<BR><BR>Groundwater's contribution to 
      stream flow is significant as, among other things, it ultimately affects 
      lake levels. Groundwater discharge is also a significant determinant of 
      the biological viability of tributary streams. In undisturbed areas, 
      groundwater discharge throughout the year provides a stable inflow of 
      water with generally consistent dissolved oxygen concentration, 
      temperature, and water chemistry. In disturbed areas where, for example, 
      land uses have significantly reduced groundwater flow to a stream, stream 
      reaches may experience diminished biological viability. Where land uses 
      add contaminants, streams may also lose viability.<BR><BR>In the Great 
      Lakes Basin, the groundwater system is recharged mainly by infiltration 
      and percolation of precipitation. Withdrawal of groundwater at rates 
      greater than the recharge rate causes water levels in aquifers to decline. 
      If the amount of decline is sufficient, water may be drawn from streams or 
      lakes into the groundwater system, thus reducing the amount of water 
      discharging to the Great Lakes. This is indicative of the inextricable 
      link between ground and surface waters.<BR><BR>Groundwater withdrawals at 
      rates high enough to warrant concern have been and are taking place at a 
      number of locations. Among the best known of these are high-volume 
      withdrawals in the Chicago–Milwaukee metropolitan region. There, in 1979, 
      in the eight-county northeastern Illinois area, deep-aquifer withdrawals 
      from the Cambrian–Ordovician aquifer system peaked at 693 million liters 
      per day (mld) (183 mgd) . During this same period, maximum pumpage 
      (withdrawals) for Milwaukee from the Cambrian–Ordovician aquifer system 
      reached 212 mld (56 mgd). This large-scale pumping produced cones of 
      depression in aquifers under Milwaukee and Chicago, with declines in the 
      levels of groundwater as great as 114 and 274 m, respectively (375 and 900 
      ft., respectively). As a result of lower pumping rates since 1980, 
      groundwater levels in the Chicago area have recovered as much as 76 m (250 
      ft.) in some localities, but groundwater levels are continuing to decline 
      in the southwestern part of the Chicago metropolitan area<A

      <P>In the strictest sense, a groundwater basin may be defined as a 
      hydrogeologic unit containing one large aquifer or several connected and 
      interrelated aquifers. In practice, the term "groundwater basin" is 
      loosely defined and implies an area containing a groundwater flow system 
      capable of storing or furnishing a substantial water supply. The 
      groundwater basin includes both the surface area and the permeable 
      materials beneath it.<BR><BR>The concept of a groundwater basin becomes 
      important because of the hydraulic continuity that exists for the 
      contained groundwater resource. A groundwater basin may or may not 
      coincide with a surface physiographic feature—that is, water in an aquifer 
      under a lake or river may actually flow away from the lake or river and be 
      deposited in a different surface-water basin. In a valley between mountain 
      ranges, the groundwater basin may occupy only the central portion of the 
      stream drainage basin. In limestone and sandhill areas, drainage and 
      groundwater basins may have entirely different configurations. The 
      physical boundaries of the groundwater basin are formed, in some 
      instances, by the physical presence of an impermeable body of rock or a 
      large body of surface water. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <BR>Other boundaries form as a result of hydrologic conditions. These 
      boundaries are hydraulic boundaries that include groundwater divides. A 
      groundwater divide can be visualized as a ridge in the water table from 
      which groundwater moves away in both directions at right angles to the 
      ridge line. Groundwater divides form hydraulic boundaries whose locations 
      are influenced by the presence of surficial features—for example, 
      topographic lows that hold major rivers and topographic highs from which 
      waters drain—and by hydraulic stresses including pumping from wells and 
      recharge. All hydraulic boundaries, including those that coincide with 
      physical features, are transitory in that these hydraulic boundaries may 
      shift location or disappear altogether if hydrologic conditions 
      change.<BR><BR>Groundwater basins may have boundaries that are 
      considerably different from the boundary of the surface water basin under 
      which the groundwaters lie. In fact, there may be several groundwater 
      basins layered at different depths, and each of these groundwater basins 
      may have a boundary that does not coincide with the boundary of the 
      surface water basin under which it is found. Accurate mapping of 
      groundwater basins has the potential to bring about changes in how we 
      manage the withdrawal of groundwater as well as in how we manage the 
      interlinked surface waters. In any case, owing to the interconnection of 
      surface water and groundwater, whether water consumption is from the 
      lakes, the tributaries, or groundwater sources, the eventual physical 
      impact on average lake levels is virtually identical.</P>

      <P><BIG><BIG><STRONG><A name=7></A>Section 7 - 
      Conservation</STRONG></BIG></BIG> </P>
      <P>The first step in sound management of resources and the exercise of the 
      precautionary principle is conservation. Some consumption, of course, is 
      essential to the functioning of the human element of ecosystems. 
      Currently, consumptive use in the Great Lakes Basin is relatively small 
      and is likely to experience only modest increases into the foreseeable 
      future. However, the cumulative impact of past activity and the likelihood 
      of future change will further stress the integrity of the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem and its ability to respond to change. Global warming will likely 
      increase and will likely change patterns of consumptive use; in 
      particular, higher average temperatures in the Basin could result in 
      increased agricultural activity and water consumption in the longer term. 
      Because of a possible downward trend in net Basin supply in the 21st 
      century, water-conservation and demand-management practices should become 
      increasingly important components of any overall sustainable use strategy. 
      Governments and citizens alike can best prepare for future uncertainty and 
      protect the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem by imbedding a robust 
      ethic of conservation into education and into every level of planning and 
      execution. <BR><BR>Experience has shown that conserving water by using it 
      more efficiently makes sound economic and environmental sense in that 
      infrastructure costs for water supply and wastewater treatment are 
      reduced, energy use is reduced, cost efficiencies are increased by 
      reducing the volumes of water and waste to be treated, resiliency of the 
      ecosystem is improved by reducing withdrawals, and exemplary behavior is 
      demonstrated to others. <BR><BR>On a basin-wide scale, implementation of 
      the Basin Water Resources Management Program—to which the states and 
      provinces are committed under the Great Lakes Charter—could provide the 
      opportunity to launch a water-conservation initiative. Sharing of 
      conservation experiences among Basin jurisdictions should be an integral 
      part of the overall approach to cooperative programs and practices. 
      Cooperating jurisdictions may wish to adopt some common approaches, as 
      appropriate, in their water-conservation plans, including incentives to 
      encourage water demand-management initiatives and the installation of best 
      practicable water-saving technology.<BR><BR>A 1999 report by the 
      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>45</SUP></A> 
      compares water use in the European Union with water use in the United 
      States and Canada and indicates that there are opportunities to reduce 
      waste and inefficient uses and to achieve energy and infrastructure cost 
      savings. The report notes that the United States and Canada use (withdraw) 
      nearly twice as much water per capita as the OECD average. Even taking 
      into account differences in economic structure and lifestyle between the 
      United States and Canada and other OECD countries, it would appear that 
      improvements in water use could be made by using appropriate, existing 
      water-conservation and demand-management techniques.<BR><BR>Demand 
      management shifts traditional thinking away from going after new water 
      supplies to more efficient use of the resource. Central to the concept of 
      demand management is the setting of prices in such a way that the amount 
      of water used by any activity is a function of price. Much can be done in 
      many areas of the Basin to use water more efficiently by such measures as 
      adopting metering of all water facilities and moving more assertively to 
      recovering the full costs of providing water services. <BR><BR>During the 
      public hearings the Commission held in September and October 1999, it was 
      suggested that the Commission should develop measurable targets for 
      reducing water withdrawals and consumptive losses and that it should 
      recommend that Basin jurisdictions adopt these targets. The Commission 
      believes, however, that decisions on conservation targets and the means 
      for achieving them are better made at the local level, where the real 
      problems and opportunities lie and where results are more likely to be 
      measurable. This approach makes it possible to build on experience gained 
      in the Basin and, at the same time, allows for measures to be tailored to 
      unique local situations. Mechanisms for sharing conservation and 
      demand-management experience should, in the Commission's view, be an 
      integral part of such programs as the Basin Water Resources Management 
      Program under the Great Lakes Charter.</P>

      Considerations</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>Water management in the Great Lakes Basin is governed by a network of 
      legal regimes, including international instruments and customs, federal 
      laws and regulations in both Canada and the United States, the laws of the 
      eight Great Lakes states and Ontario and Quebec, and the rights of 
      Aboriginal Peoples and Indian tribes under Canadian and U.S. laws. This 
      section is not intended to be a full discussion of all legal issues; 
      rather, it is intended to be an identification of aspects of the legal 
      regime that bear most directly on the issues raised in this 
      report.<BR><BR><STRONG>The International Legal 
      Context</STRONG><BR><BR><EM>Boundary Waters Treaty.</EM> The Boundary 
      Waters Treaty of 1909 is the primary international legal instrument 
      governing the use of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin. The treaty 
      established certain basic legal principles to deal with boundary and 
      transboundary waters and created the International Joint Commission to 
      help implement portions of the treaty. For over 90 years, the treaty has 
      been effective in assisting Canada and the United States to avoid and 
      resolve disputes over freshwater.<BR><BR>Under the treaty, boundary waters 
      (i.e., the waters along which the boundary passes) are treated differently 
      from transboundary rivers or tributaries. Thus, the treaty does not deal 
      with all waters of the Great Lakes Basin in the same way. With some 
      exceptions, Article III provides that the use, diversion, or obstruction 
      of boundary waters must be approved by the Commission if water levels or 
      flows on the other side of the boundary are to be affected. With respect 
      to tributaries of boundary waters and transboundary rivers, however, 
      Article II states that each nation reserves "the exclusive jurisdiction 
      and control over [their] use and diversion." The treaty does not 
      explicitly refer to groundwater.<BR><BR>The treaty also provides that the 
      governments of the United States and Canada may refer issues to the 
      Commission to investigate and to make recommendations on, in order to help 
      the countries resolve and avoid disputes along the border. This provision 
      of the treaty has been used many times over the years to address water 
      quality and water quantity issues in the Great Lakes and 
      elsewhere.<BR><BR><EM>Great Lakes Charter.</EM> The 1985 Great Lakes 
      Charter is an arrangement among the Great Lakes states and the provinces 
      of Ontario and Quebec. Although the Charter is not binding, it focuses the 
      Great Lakes states and provinces on a number of resource issues and 
      fosters cooperation among them. The Charter provides that the planning and 
      management of the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin should be 
      founded upon the integrity of the natural resources and ecosystem of the 
      Great Lakes Basin. Moreover, the Charter stipulates that the water 
      resources of the Basin should be treated as a single hydrologic system 
      that transcends political boundaries in the Basin. New or increased major 
      diversions and consumptive use of the water resources of the Great Lakes 
      are said to be matters of serious concern, and the Charter states that 
      "[it] is the intent of the signatory states and provinces that diversions 
      of Basin water resources will not be allowed if individually or 
      cumulatively they would have any significant adverse impacts on lake 
      levels, in-basin uses and the Great Lakes Ecosystem."<BR><BR>The Charter 
      provides that no state or province will approve or permit any major new or 
      increased diversion or consumptive use of the water resources of the Great 
      Lakes Basin without notifying and consulting with and seeking the consent 
      and concurrence of all affected Great Lakes states and provinces. The 
      trigger point for notification and for seeking the consent and concurrence 
      of other Great Lakes states and provinces is an average use of 5 million 
      gallons (19 million liters) per day in any 30-day period. In order to 
      participate in this notice and consultation process, jurisdictions must be 
      in a position to provide accurate and comparable information on water 
      withdrawals in excess of 100,000 gallons (380,000 liters) per day in any 
      30-day period and must have authority to manage and regulate water 
      withdrawals involving a total diversion or consumptive use of Great Lakes 
      Basin water resources in excess of 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) 
      per day average in any 30-day period.<BR><BR>The Great Lakes Charter also 
      records a commitment by the signatory states and provinces to pursue the 
      development and maintenance of a common base of data and information 
      regarding the use and management of Basin water resources, the 
      establishment of systematic arrangements for the exchange of water data 
      and information, the creation of a Water Resources Management Committee, 
      the development of a Great Lakes Basin Water Resources Management Program, 
      and additional coordinated research efforts to provide improved 
      information for future water planning and management decisions. Although 
      not fully implemented, these commitments point toward the kind of 
      cooperation and coordination that is required in the future.<BR><BR>On 
      October 15, 1999, the Great Lakes governors issued a statement renewing 
      their commitment to the principles contained in the Great Lakes Charter 
      and pledged to develop a new agreement, based on those principles, that 
      would bind the states and provinces more closely to collectively planning, 
      managing, and making decisions regarding the protection of the waters of 
      the Great Lakes<A 
      href="http://www.ijc.org/boards/cde/finalreport/footnotes.html"><SUP>46</SUP></A>. 
      The governors also pledged to develop a new common standard, based on the 
      protection of the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, against which 
      water projects will be reviewed.<BR><BR><EM>International Trade Law.</EM> 
      One issue raised by the governments in the Reference was whether 
      international trade obligations might affect water management in the 
      Basin. To address this issue, the Commission, with the assistance of the 
      study team, reviewed the relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) 
      agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as 
      well as the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 
      Canada–United States–Mexico North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
      and relevant case law. The Commission and its study team also consulted 
      experts in the field.<BR><BR>The Commission believes it is unlikely that 
      water in its natural state (e.g., in a lake, river, or aquifer) is 
      included within the scope of any of these trade agreements since it is not 
      a product or good. This view is supported by the fact that the NAFTA 
      parties have issued a statement to this effect. When water is "captured" 
      and enters into commerce, it may, however, attract obligations under the 
      GATT, the FTA, and the NAFTA. <BR><BR>The key GATT provision with possible 
      significance for water exports is the prohibition of quantitative 
      restrictions in Article XI. The GATT, however, creates a number of 
      exceptions. Of these, the most relevant to trade in water would appear to 
      be those related to measures "necessary to protect human, animal, or plant 
      life or health" (the "health exception") or "relating to the conservation 
      of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in 
      conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption" (the 
      "conservation exception"). With respect to the former, there has been some 
      debate as to whether this provision should be read broadly, so as to in 
      effect create an "environmental" exception to the GATT, or narrowly, so as 
      to embrace essentially traditional concerns related to sanitary and 
      phytosanitary measures. With respect to the latter, there may be a 
      question as to whether water is an exhaustible natural resource, although 
      this raises less of a problem in the case of a discrete ecosystem such as 
      the Great Lakes Basin, where only a small part of the resource is 
      replenished annually. Both exceptions are qualified by a requirement that 
      they "[not] be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of 
      arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same 
      conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international 
      trade."<BR><BR>Although dispute-settlement panels considering these GATT 
      exceptions have affirmed, in principle, that trade interests may have to 
      give way to legitimate environmental concerns, it is also true that the 
      same panels have questioned very closely whether measures nominally taken 
      for environmental reasons have underlying protectionist elements. Clearly, 
      then, the achievement of a coherent and consistent approach to water 
      conservation and management in the Great Lakes Basin—an approach clearly 
      grounded in environmental policy—would be an important step in addressing 
      any trade-related concerns with respect to the use of Basin 
      waters.<BR><BR>The NAFTA trade obligations with respect to goods, while 
      rooted in the GATT, appear to constrain the availability of certain GATT 
      exceptions—including the conservation exception—in some important ways, in 
      effect making it more difficult to "turn off the tap" once trade in water 
      has been established. These constraints do not, however, apply to the 
      health exception, and the NAFTA wording of that exception specifically 
      provides that it is understood by the parties to include environmental 
      measures. NAFTA also makes provision for certain trade obligations in 
      environmental/conservation agreements to prevail in the event of a 
      conflict. Finally, it should be recalled that following the signing of 
      NAFTA, the three parties issued a joint declaration that NAFTA creates no 
      rights to the natural water resources of any party; that unless water, in 
      any form, has entered into commerce and has become a good or product, it 
      is not covered by the provisions of any trade agreement, including NAFTA; 
      and that international rights and obligations respecting water in its 
      natural state are contained in separate treaties, such as the Boundary 
      Waters Treaty, negotiated for that purpose.<BR><BR>Many people who made 
      presentations during the Commission's hearings in September and October 
      1999 believed that the NAFTA and WTO agreements could prevent or at least 
      impede the United States and Canada from prohibiting the export of Great 
      Lakes waters and the diversion of those waters. Several noted that to 
      date, in all the cases before the WTO involving issues of protecting 
      environmental or natural resource interests, the WTO had ruled against 
      those interests. Some observed that the WTO decision-making process was 
      not transparent. <BR><BR>Since issuing its Interim Report, the Commission 
      has received a letter dated November 24, 1999, from the Deputy United 
      States Trade Representative concerning the implications of international 
      trade agreements for the protection of the waters of the Great Lakes 
      Basin. A copy of this letter is attached (Appendix 8). The Commission has 
      also received a document entitled Bulk Water Removal and International 
      Trade Considerations from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and 
      International Trade (Appendix 9). These submissions generally are 
      consistent with the Commission's views regarding the effect of 
      international trade law on the ability of the two countries to protect the 
      water resources of the Great Lakes Basin.<BR><BR>The Commission also 
      received legal opinions from several experts. The following points 
      synthesize the thrust of these opinions received and are intended to take 
      into account the uncertainties and the caution expressed with respect to 
      international trade law. They are similar to the views expressed by the 
      Canadian and U.S. governments.</P>

              <LI>The provisions of NAFTA and the WTO agreements do not prevent 
              Canada and the United States from taking measures to protect their 
              water resources and preserve the integrity of the Great Lakes 
              Basin ecosystem where there is no discrimination by 
              decision-makers against individuals from other countries in the 
              application of those measures.<BR>
              <LI>NAFTA and the WTO agreements do not constrain or affect the 
              sovereign right of a government to decide whether or not it will 
              allow natural resources within its jurisdiction to be exploited 
              and, if a natural resource is allowed to be exploited, the pace 
              and manner of such exploitation.<BR>
              <LI>Moreover, even if there were sales or diversions of water from 
              the Great Lakes Basin in the past, governments could still decide 
              not to allow new and additional sales or diversions in the future. 
              <BR>
              <LI>The NAFTA and WTO agreements contain provisions that prohibit 
              export restrictions and discrimination between nationals and 
              foreigners who are entitled to national treatment under those 
              treaties. Sales of water that are allowed could not be restricted 
              to the domestic market unless they fit within the health and 
              conservation exceptions referred to above (i.e., restrictive 
              measures would be necessary for the protection of human, animal, 
              or plant life or health or for the conservation of an exhaustible 
              natural resource and are not applied in a way that constitutes 
              arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised 
              restriction of international trade). Recent decisions of the 
              appellate body of the WTO may raise concerns about the 
              circumstances in which environmental measures will meet the test 
              of not constituting arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a 
              disguised restriction of international trade, even though they may 
              otherwise relate to the conservation of an exhaustible natural 
              resource or may be necessary for the protection of life or health. 
              The WTO decisions have tended to focus on whether measures are 
              arbitrary or discriminatory. In the light of these decisions, it 
              appears that it would be desirable, whenever possible, for 
              environmental measures to be based on an international agreement 
              or arrangement.<BR>
              <LI>If governments in Canada and the United States want to avoid 
              falling within the investment provisions of the NAFTA, they should 
              avoid creating undue expectations by clearly articulating their 
              water-management policies in a fully transparent manner, by acting 
              in a manner that is entirely consistent with their stated policy, 
              and by limiting the time for which authorizations are valid. 
              Moreover, the governments should make it clear that authorizations 
              do not give rise to any continuing entitlement or expectation on 
              the part of the holder of the authorization, that, if the holder 
              of the authorization were to reapply after the expiry of the 
              authorization, there is no guarantee that that person would be 
              given treatment any more favorable than any other person who might 
              apply, and that it is within the government's jurisdiction to 
              decide whether or not even to permit an authorization to be issued 
              again. <BR>
              <LI>Actions with respect to water diversions or sales that 
              nationalize or expropriate an investment of a foreigner may lead 
              to a claim under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, which gives private 
              investors of one country the right to commence proceedings against 
              another country for injuries to the rights accorded private 
              investors under the agreement. In all other cases, claims under 
              the WTO agreements or the NAFTA must be brought by a Party to the 
              agreement (i.e., by the government of one of the countries).

      <P>Other experts, while not suggesting international trade law made it 
      impossible to regulate exports of water, cautioned that trade law could 
      make the process more complicated.<BR><BR><STRONG>The Domestic Legal 
      Context</STRONG><BR><BR><EM>In Canada.</EM> The constitutional 
      underpinnings of Canadian water law are found in the Constitution Act. 
      Because water is not treated explicitly in that act, the respective 
      federal and provincial roles in water management can be found under a 
      number of constitutional headings that may be either legislative or 
      proprietary in nature.<BR><BR>Federal legislative jurisdiction over water 
      is rooted in several headings under the Constitution Act. The most obvious 
      are the specific federal responsibilities for navigation and shipping and 
      for sea coast and inland fisheries. Other headings, such as trade and 
      commerce, Indians and lands reserved for Indians, agriculture (a power 
      exercised concurrently with the provinces), criminal law (especially with 
      respect to pollution), and undertakings (including canals) connecting or 
      extending beyond the limits of a province, are also relevant. Two other 
      more general grants of legislative authority are also relevant. The first 
      general grant is the power of the federal government to implement treaties 
      concluded by the British Empire on Canada's behalf. This power supports 
      the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, but it has not been extended 
      to treaties concluded by Canada in its own right. The second general grant 
      is the power to make laws for the "peace, order and good government" of 
      Canada. Although this power has had a checkered history, it has been used 
      to justify federal authority over marine dumping within provincial waters, 
      and it could take on significance with respect to issues such as climate 
      change that are determined to have a primarily national or international 
      character.<BR><BR>On November 22, 1999, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
      introduced in the House of Commons proposed amendments to the 
      International Boundary Waters Treaty Act that, if enacted, will impose a 
      prohibition on removals of boundary waters from their water basins. The 
      proposed amendments also provide that the Governor in Council, on the 
      recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, may make regulations 
      that create exceptions to this prohibition. Moreover, the amendments will 
      require persons to obtain a license from the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
      for the use, obstruction, or diversion of boundary waters in a manner that 
      in any way affects, or is likely to affect, the natural level or flow of 
      boundary waters on the other side of the international boundary. This 
      licensing requirement does not, however, apply to the ordinary use of 
      waters for domestic or sanitary purposes or in cases for which exceptions 
      have been established by regulations. <BR><BR>According to the Canadian 
      government, the recently introduced amendments to the International 
      Boundary Waters Treaty Act are part of its three-part strategy, announced 
      on February 10, 1999, to prohibit the removal of water (including removals 
      for the purposes of export) out of major Canadian water basins. The 
      strategy includes the joint Reference by Canada and the United States to 
      the International Joint Commission on consumptive uses, diversion, and 
      removal of Great Lakes water. It also includes an effort by the Canadian 
      Minister of the Environment to seek the endorsement by provinces and 
      territories of a Canada-wide accord prohibiting bulk water removals to 
      ensure that all of Canada's watersheds are protected. This process 
      continues. <BR><BR>Apart from its legislative powers, the federal 
      government also exercises certain proprietary rights that may involve a 
      water-management role. These rights include ownership of specified public 
      works such as canals (and connected lands and water power), public 
      harbors, lighthouses and piers, river and lake improvements, lands set 
      apart for general public purposes, and national parks.<BR><BR>Although the 
      federal government exercises jurisdiction over water management primarily 
      through its legislative authority under the Constitution Act, provinces 
      also derive important authority from their proprietary rights. The 
      Constitution Act provides, with limited exceptions, for provincial 
      ownership of all public lands (including water). The legislative powers of 
      the provinces largely buttress their proprietary powers and include 
      authority with respect to management and sale of public lands, local works 
      and undertakings, property and civil rights in the province, and generally 
      all matters of a local or private nature.<BR><BR>There is no plenary 
      federal legislation with respect to water. Historically, the primary 
      interest of the federal government in water management has been focused on 
      its constitutional responsibilities for fisheries (through the Fisheries 
      Act), navigation (through the Navigable Waters Protection Act), and 
      international relations, although it has in recent years taken a role in 
      water quality, particularly with respect to toxic substances.<BR><BR>The 
      most ambitious attempt by the federal government to legislate in a 
      comprehensive fashion with respect to water was the Canada Water Act of 
      1970. The act emphasizes federal–provincial cooperation and includes 
      provisions for unilateral federal action on transboundary issues. In 
      practice, however, the federal role envisaged in the act has not been 
      fully realized. The International Rivers Improvements Act also has 
      potential application to some water withdrawals with transboundary 
      aspects. The act requires a license for international river improvements. 
      The definition of an international river is very broad and would include, 
      for example, a transboundary water pipeline.<BR><BR>The International 
      Rivers Improvement Act is, however, subject to two important exceptions: 
      It does not apply to improvements situated within boundary waters as 
      defined by the Boundary Waters Treaty, nor does it apply to improvements 
      "constructed, operated or maintained solely for domestic, sanitary or 
      irrigation purposes, or other similar consumptive uses." In sum, as with 
      other federal legislation, the act is not designed to provide a general 
      mechanism for dealing with water removals, and it would not even apply to 
      schemes that do not involve a physical "work" of some kind.<BR><BR>The 
      Ontario Water Resources Act (OWRA) prohibits the withdrawal of more than 
      50,000 liters (13,209 gal.) of water a day from a well or from surface 
      waters without a permit. Ontario's recently issued Water Taking and 
      Transfer regulation, which took effect on April 30, 1999, among other 
      things, prohibits the transfer of water out of the Great Lakes Basin, 
      subject to certain exceptions.<BR><BR>In Quebec, the Civil Code contains 
      provisions concerning the use of water, including the rights of riparian 
      owners. Moreover, Quebec's Environmental Quality Act, which is concerned 
      primarily with contamination and withdrawals that have a significant 
      effect on the environment, imposes constraints on the use of 
      water.<BR><BR>The Quebec Minister of the Environment introduced Bill 73 on 
      October 21, 1999, in the Quebec National Assembly, and it was assented to 
      on November 26, 1999. The bill, a proposal for a Water Resources 
      Preservation Act, was put forward as an interim measure to prevent adverse 
      effects on the environment from water transfers outside Quebec prior to 
      completion of the public inquiry that is now underway regarding a 
      framework for water management. The Water Resources Preservation Act 
      prohibits the transfer outside Quebec of surface or groundwater taken in 
      Quebec. Bill 73 does, however, provide exceptions for (1) water to produce 
      electric power, (2) water to be marketed for human consumption that is 
      packaged in Quebec in containers of 20 liters or less, (3) water to supply 
      potable water to establishments or dwellings situated "in a bordering 
      zone," and (4) water to supply vehicles. Moreover, the government may lift 
      the prohibition on the grounds of urgency, for humanitarian reasons, or 
      for any other reason considered to be in the public 
      interest.<BR><BR><EM>In the United States.</EM> Congress has plenary power 
      under the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution to regulate interstate 
      commerce. This federal authority includes the power to authorize and 
      control the diversion of water from one navigable waterway to another or 
      from one watershed to another, and it also includes the power to authorize 
      the use of water for navigational purposes. The exercise of this 
      Congressional power is as broad as the needs of commerce. It extends to 
      the use of water of a navigable stream for the production of hydroelectric 
      power and to the protection of navigable waters from obstruction by 
      out-of-basin diversions and from pollution. <BR><BR>The Great Lakes Basin 
      Compact, which was agreed to by the eight Great Lakes states and approved 
      by the U.S. Congress in 1968 and which created the Great Lakes Commission, 
      provides, among other things, for joint or cooperative action to promote 
      the orderly, integrated, and comprehensive development, use, and 
      conservation of the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin and to plan 
      for the welfare and development of these water resources. <BR><BR>The 
      Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA) is a federal law that 
      prohibits any further diversion of water from any U.S. portion of the 
      Great Lakes or their tributaries for use outside the Basin unless such 
      diversion is approved by the governors of all Great Lakes states. It also 
      prohibits federal studies of diversions without the concurrence of the 
      governors. The impetus for the Charter and for WRDA was the concern in the 
      U.S. portion of the Great Lakes Basin, in the early 1980s, that there 
      would be major demands for Great Lakes Basin water from the agricultural 
      and energy sectors of the western and southern United States.<BR><BR>The 
      Commission received legal advice on issues related to the Commerce Clause 
      of the U.S. Constitution.</P>

              <LI>Under the Supreme Court doctrine known as the Dormant Commerce 
              Clause Doctrine, federal courts may invalidate state laws that 
              either blatantly discriminate against interstate commerce or 
              unreasonably burden interstate commerce in other ways. Courts have 
              consistently applied this doctrine to invalidate state legislation 
              that simply blocks the flow of goods across state lines. On the 
              other hand, they have also recognized that there are times—for 
              example, times of shortage—when a state may favor its own 
              citizens. There are also times when legitimate state interests may 
              justify actions by states that do affect interstate commerce. The 
              more narrowly tailored any restraints on commercialization can be, 
              and the more targeted to preservation of ecological integrity, the 
              more likely the restraints are to be sustained against a Commerce 
              Clause attack. How a court will act in any given case will, of 
              course, depend on the facts of that case.<BR>
              <LI>The Commission is not aware of any cases where the doctrine 
              has been applied to waters allocated by the doctrine of riparian 
              rights, as are the Great Lakes in the United States, or to 
              interstate or boundary waters widely shared among basin states and 
              a foreign nation. Moreover, Congress has the power to authorize 
              state legislation that would otherwise violate the Dormant 
              Commerce Clause Doctrine, and neither the Court nor commentators 
              have suggested any limitations on this power that would restrain 
              Congressional approval of Great Lakes protection efforts. It is 
              very clear under the Commerce Clause cases that, where Congress 
              has authorized a restraint on trade, there is no Commerce Clause 
              problem. <BR>
              <LI>The Water Resources Development Act of 1986, by not having 
              standards, may run afoul of the nondelegation doctrine. The U.S. 
              Supreme Court has not, however, found an improper delegation since 
              1935, and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 could be 
              upheld by the Court finding appropriate standards in a variety of 
              sources, such as practice and existing arrangements, including the 
              Great Lakes Charter. This issue could be addressed by the creation 
              of appropriate standards that were legally binding on the states 
              </LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>Historically, surface water law in each of the Great Lakes states has 
      been based on the doctrine of riparian rights. Under this doctrine, the 
      right to make reasonable use of water in rivers and lakes was incidental 
      to the ownership of land that abutted the water. Leaving aside the 
      relevant provisions of the Boundary Waters Treaty, this right could be 
      exercised even if it caused some diminution in the quantity or quality of 
      the water remaining in the river or lake. The riparian right was usually 
      limited to the use of the water on the riparian land and within the 
      watershed of origin. Traditionally, the use of groundwater was not 
      similarly restricted. Each of the Great Lakes states has made legislative 
      changes to the legal regime over many years, to address specific needs in 
      that state. Changes range from collecting information regarding specific 
      large uses to requiring permits for withdrawals or consumptive uses above 
      a certain amount. Although there is no clear pattern to these legislative 
      changes, they do provide different approaches to achieve overall state 
      water-management goals within a context of riparian rights.<BR><BR>With 
      the signing of the Great Lakes Charter, each of the Great Lakes states 
      found it necessary to institute a legal regime for protecting the Great 
      Lakes ecosystem. Different states have adopted different statutes. Most 
      state laws deal with water withdrawals in general or with withdrawals in 
      the context of Basin waters. Typically, the level of withdrawal that 
      triggers state permitting requirements is well below that which triggers 
      review under the Great Lakes Charter. Although some Basin states 
      (Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin) include a statutory provision that 
      specifically requires consultations with the other Great Lakes states and 
      provinces in the event of diversions from the Basin that fall within the 
      Charter's trigger provision of 5 million gallons (19 million liters) per 
      day, others have not provided for this explicitly.<BR><BR>Since the 
      signing of the Great Lakes Charter and the adoption of the Water Resources 
      Development Act, several proposals for diversions of Great Lakes water 
      have been considered by the Great Lakes governors and premiers. These 
      proposals include diversions at Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, and at Akron, 
      Ohio, which were approved, and at Lowell, Indiana, which was denied. A 
      proposal to divert water from the Crandon Mine to the Wisconsin River was 
      retracted without formal consideration by the Great Lakes governors. A 
      proposal to withdraw water from Lake Huron for the Mud Creek irrigation 
      district in Michigan, an increased consumptive use, went forward even 
      though there were objections by some Great Lakes jurisdictions. To date, 
      the Mud Creek irrigation project has been the only consumptive use 
      proposal large enough to trigger the Charter requirement for notice, 
      consultation, and seeking the concurrence of all Great Lakes Basin 
      jurisdictions. Consequently, the Charter has not yet provided the impetus 
      for an ongoing conversation among the jurisdictions on the subject of 
      consumptive uses.<BR><BR>The implementing resolutions for the Great Lakes 
      Charter that were approved by the Great Lakes governors and premiers in 
      1987 outlined a review process for diversion proposals. A process has 
      evolved for reviewing and approving diversions pursuant to the Charter and 
      the WRDA. A custom and usage has developed of requiring extensive 
      information before a diversion proposal can be approved. The states have 
      also developed the practice of employing the Charter procedures regarding 
      consultation for diversion proposals covered by WRDA that do not meet the 
      Charter trigger point, so that the provinces are consulted although they 
      have no rights under WRDA. <BR><BR>The Commission notes that while WRDA 
      offers the strength of mandatory review of all proposed diversions, 
      concern has been expressed by observers that WRDA applies only to 
      diversions in the United States, does not address consumptive use, 
      contains no criteria for the governors to use in considering proposals, 
      contains no appeal procedure, and may not cover 
      groundwater.<BR><BR>Legislation was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 
      1999 to impose a moratorium on the export of water from the U.S. portion 
      of the Great Lakes and, in one case, from elsewhere in the United States 
      pending the development of agreed principles and procedures that would 
      protect the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin. To date, there has 
      not been final Congressional action on these legislative initiatives.

      <STRONG>Aboriginal Peoples and Indian Tribes</STRONG><BR><BR>In Canada, 
      Aboriginal and treaty rights are recognized and affirmed by the 
      Constitution Act, 1982, although the specific nature and the extent of 
      these rights have not yet been determined. Aboriginal Peoples' interests 
      in land are understood to be communal in nature, involving rights of 
      occupation as well as the use and benefit of resources. The extent to 
      which Aboriginal Peoples' interests extend to water and waterways may vary 
      significantly with the circumstances, including whether the particular 
      interest has the status of a treaty right. It is not clearly settled 
      whether Aboriginal Peoples' interests in water are riparian in nature. 
      More generally, however, the federal government may have an obligation to 
      consult with Aboriginal Peoples, which is underpinned by its fiduciary 
      duty toward them.<BR><BR>In the United States, the right of Indian tribes 
      to the use of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin has continued without 
      significant challenge since the reservations were established (late 1700s 
      to the mid-1800s). Although litigation has occurred regarding the 
      existence and extent of tribal fishing rights in the Great Lakes, there 
      does not appear to have been any dispute over tribal use of water from the 
      Great Lakes or its tributaries flowing through or adjacent to the 
      reservations.<BR><BR>During its recent hearings, the Commission received 
      numerous submissions with respect to the interest and involvement of 
      Aboriginal Peoples and Indian tribes. These submissions uniformly 
      expressed opposition to exports or diversions from the Great Lakes Basin 
      and strongly urged the need to ensure opportunities for the participation 
      of Aboriginal Peoples and Indian tribes in decisions concerning the waters 
      of the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem. <BR><BR>During its hearings, the 
      Commission was also requested to clarify the relationship between 
      international trade agreements and treaties with Aboriginal Peoples and 
      Indian tribes. The Commission is not, however, the appropriate forum in 
      which to address this issue.</P>

      <P>The Reference asks the Commission to report on additional work that may 
      be required to better understand the implications of consumption, 
      diversions, and removal of water—including removals for export from 
      boundary waters outside the Great Lakes Basin, removals of waters of 
      transboundary basins, and removals of groundwater of shared aquifers—and 
      to prepare a plan proposing the phasing of such additional 
      work.<BR><BR>The Commission's binational, interdisciplinary study team 
      undertook a reconnaissance survey of shared watersheds beyond the Great 
      Lakes Basin to determine the availability of water supply and consumptive 
      use data and the availability of information on such matters as diversions 
      and other removals, bilateral agreements and arrangements with respect to 
      water quantity and quality issues, groundwater, and climate change. Based 
      on this survey, the study team identified the following areas of study in 
      which further work could assist in better understanding the implications 
      of consumption, diversions, and removal of water. It was, however, 
      recognized that these areas of study may not be applicable in the same way

      <P>The Commission has consulted states and provinces along the border 
      about the plans for additional work on consumption, diversions, and 
      removal of waters from boundary waters outside the Great Lakes Basin, 
      transboundary waters, and shared aquifers. In general, jurisdictions 
      appreciate the importance of these issues and appear to be prepared to 
      share existing information with the Commission. There were, however, 
      different views about how these issues should be addressed.<BR><BR>All 
      western states expressed an interest in cooperating with the Commission on 
      the study. In some of the Canadian provinces, however, there was some 
      concern that encompassing all boundary and transboundary basins and shared 
      aquifers in one sea-to-sea approach could, in some cases, lead to an 
      inappropriate linking of issues.<BR><BR>Manitoba supports the study and 
      would like to participate in such a new or extended Reference. Moreover, 
      Manitoba officials consider that the Commission could be of assistance in 
      resolving binational water quantity issues that are on the horizon, 
      including the apportionment of water crossing the Manitoba–North Dakota 
      portion of the border. North Dakota also considers that the Commission 
      could play a useful role in this area. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Alberta 
      and Saskatchewan officials expressed a number of concerns about the 
      proposed study. In their view, water quantity issues are well in hand in 
      their areas, and they consider that a new or extended Reference would not 
      only duplicate work that is being done by the Alberta and Saskatchewan 
      governments, but would also confuse the public. Moreover, they expressed 
      concern that there could be inappropriate comparisons (e.g., comparisons 
      between eastern and western situations); that local issues could become 
      linked, making them more difficult to manage and resolve; and that a 
      broad-brush study could reopen old wounds for no apparent 
      reason.<BR><BR>In the east, the Commission consulted with officials from 
      New Hampshire, Vermont, and New Brunswick. There was a general feeling 
      among the participants that all major issues in the boundary region were 
      being addressed appropriately. In addition, budgets throughout the region 
      were extremely tight. Nevertheless, all three jurisdictions were willing 
      to contribute data and information and participate in Commission work 
      under the current reference to the extent that resources were 
      available.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>The Commission considers that further 
      work in the areas the study team identified could provide a better 
      understanding of the implications of consumption, diversions, and removal 
      of water from boundary waters outside the Great Lakes Basin, from waters 
      of transboundary basins, and from groundwater of shared aquifers. Taking 
      into account the views it has received, the Commission believes that some 
      issues—such as climate change and groundwater research—should be addressed 
      across the entire border region, and other issues—such as water balances 
      in the plains region and water apportionment in the border region between 
      Manitoba and North Dakota—should be focused at the regional 
      level.<BR><BR>This approach would allow efforts and resources to be 
      focused on important concerns with respect to consumption, diversions, and 
      removal of water in the border region without duplicating work that is 
      being done in states and provinces. This would provide for work to 
      continue binationally, focusing on those priority issues that are not 
      being addressed elsewhere and on specific regional issues to which the 
      Commission can contribute binational experience and resources. In both 
      instances, the Commission's involvement would serve its traditional 
      purpose of acting impartially in the common interest of both countries to 
      prevent and resolve differences.</P>

      Conclusions</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
      <P>The Commission was charged to provide recommendations to the 
      governments concerning the protection of the waters of the Great Lakes. In 
      the course of developing these recommendations, conducting its studies, 
      and consulting with the public, the Commission was able to draw several 
      conclusions and to note matters it believes should be brought to the 
      attention of the governments at this time. The Commission was also able to 
      identify and build upon principles that would effectively lead to both the 
      protection and the enhancement of the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem.<BR><BR><STRONG>The Great Lakes Basin 
      Ecosystem</STRONG><BR><BR><EM>1. The Great Lakes: A Critical 
      Resource</EM>. Water is a critical resource that is essential for all 
      forms of life and for a broad range of economic and social activities. The 
      Great Lakes, sometimes referred to as North America's inland sea, are one 
      of the largest freshwater ecosystems in the world and support about 40 
      million people and a diversity of biotic populations. Moreover, the lakes 
      are a central feature of the natural and cultural heritage of the Great 
      Lakes region and the social and economic interdependence of eight U.S. 
      states and two Canadian provinces.<BR><BR><EM>2. The Aquatic 
      Ecosystem.</EM> The Great Lakes aquatic ecosystem is made up not only of 
      the lakes themselves, but also of the complex network of tributaries and 
      groundwater on which the lakes depend. Changes to the lakes, the 
      tributaries, or the groundwater can alter the balance of the ecosystem of 
      the region in significant and sometimes unpredictable ways. Measures aimed 
      at protecting and conserving the waters of the Great Lakes must cover the 
      surface water of the lakes, connecting channels, tributaries, and 
      groundwater if they are to be effective.<BR><BR><EM>3. Conservation</EM>. 
      Conservation measures can and should minimize the amount of water that is 
      withdrawn and consumed in the Great Lakes Basin, and such measures must 
      form part of any effort to preserve the integrity of the waters of the 
      Great Lakes Basin and ensure the sustainability of those resources. 
      <BR><BR><EM>4. System Stress</EM>. Removals of water from the Great Lakes 
      Basin reduce the resilience of the system and its capacity to cope with 
      future, unpredictable stresses. On an average annual basis, less than 1 
      percent of the water in the Great Lakes system—approximately 613 billion 
      liters per day (162 billion gallons per day)—is renewable. Any water taken 
      from the system has to be replaced in order to restore the system's lost 
      resilience. It is not possible at this time to identify with any 
      confidence all the adverse consequences of water removals so that these 
      consequences could be mitigated. The precautionary approach dictates that 
      removals should not be authorized unless it can be shown, with confidence, 
      that they will not adversely affect the integrity of the Great Lakes Basin 
      ecosystem.<BR><BR><EM>5. Climate Influences.</EM> Although the outflows 
      from Lake Ontario and Lake Superior are regulated, the levels of the lakes 
      ultimately depend on climatic conditions that cannot be controlled or even 
      reliably predicted. It can, however, be expected that the Great Lakes 
      system will continue to experience periods of high and low precipitation 
      and therefore high and low levels and variable flows, which will be 
      beneficial to some interests and disruptive to others. As illustrated 
      during 1998–99—when the level of Lakes Michigan–Huron dropped 57 cm (22 
      in.) in 12 months—water levels can change quickly over short periods in 
      response to climate conditions. <BR><BR><EM>6. Use of Great Lakes 
      Water</EM>. If all interests in the Basin are considered, there is never a 
      "surplus" of water in the Great Lakes system; every drop of water has 
      several potential uses, and trade-offs must be made when, through human 
      intervention, waters are removed from the system. Environmental interests, 
      for example, require fluctuations between high and low levels to preserve 
      diversity. Seemingly "wasted", the infrequent very high waters do, in 
      fact, serve a purpose by inundating less frequently wetted areas and 
      renewing habitat for their biotic occupants. Major outflows from the Great 
      Lakes provide needed freshwater input to fish populations as far away as 
      the Gulf of Maine.<BR><BR><EM>7. Water Quality and Water Quantity</EM>. 
      Water quantity and water quality are inextricably linked. For most uses, 
      quantity alone does not satisfy the demand. Since the signing of the Great 
      Lakes Water Quality Agreement, significant strides have been made toward 
      restoring and preserving the quality of water in the Great Lakes Basin. 
      However, in many areas, the restoration has not been complete and problems 
      remain. In these situations, this poor water quality impairs the potential 
      uses of the waters of the Great Lakes and constitutes a virtual "removal" 
      of usable waters from the system.<BR><BR><EM>8. Climate Change</EM>. 
      Mounting evidence of the potential for climate change adds uncertainty to 
      the nature of future supplies to the Great Lakes and how the levels and 
      flows of the lakes will be affected. All climate models to date agree that 
      there will be some increase in temperature in North America. Although most 
      models suggest that global warming would lower Great Lakes levels and 
      outflows, there is some limited new information that suggests the 
      possibility of a slight rise in water levels. There is information to 
      suggest that there could be more frequent and severe local weather events. 
      Climate change also has the potential to increase the demand for water, 
      both inside and outside the Great Lakes Basin.<BR><BR><EM>9. Future 
      Demands</EM>. There is uncertainty not only with respect to water supplies 
      to the Great Lakes Basin, but also with respect to future demand for water 
      within the Basin. The use of water for irrigation is increasing in the 
      Basin. Currently, however, there is a trend to slower growth in water 
      withdrawals in the Great Lakes region. This trend is the result of 
      conservation and environmental measures, shifts in resources from the 
      industrial sector to the service sector, and a decline in population 
      growth, mainly in the portion of the Basin that lies within the United 
      States. Whether this trend will continue cannot be predicted. Existing 
      water use data, much of which is out of date, do not provide a reliable 
      basis from which to predict future demand, and withdrawals could start to 
      rise again with economic growth or climate change. <BR><BR><EM>10. 
      Diversions and Other Removals</EM>. Over the longer term, a number of 
      factors may affect the demand for water diversions and other bulk 
      removals. Global population growth or climate changes could result in 
      requests for shipments of Great Lakes water to meet short-term 
      humanitarian needs. Geography and distance may reduce such demands as 
      there are more logical and more economical water sources closer to most 
      areas of potential drought. The United Nations advocates that the solution 
      to future water crises rests with nations learning to use water more 
      efficiently, not in shipping freshwater around the world. <BR><BR><EM>11. 
      Potential Diversions</EM>. There are no active proposals for major 
      diversion projects either into or out of the Basin at the present time. 
      There is little reason to believe that such projects will become 
      economically, environmentally, and socially feasible in the foreseeable 
      future. Although the Commission has not identified any planning for or 
      consideration of major diversions in areas outside the Basin, such 
      diversions cannot be entirely discounted. There are no active proposals 
      for any smaller diversions into or out of the Great Lakes Basin at this 
      time, although growth trends would indicate that such requests are likely 
      from communities on or near the Great Lakes Basin divide.<BR><BR><EM>12. 
      Interruptions of Supply</EM>. Apart from the many engineering, economic, 
      environmental, and social obstacles to construction of large-scale 
      diversions, and given the variations in water levels and flows in the 
      Great Lakes, it would be impossible for the Great Lakes jurisdictions to 
      guarantee an uninterruptible supply to any mega-removal. Some interests in 
      the Great Lakes Basin, such as riparian homeowners, might welcome a means 
      of removing water from the Basin during periods of extremely high levels. 
      Most interests, including in-stream interests, commercial navigation, and 
      recreational boating, would be adamantly opposed to such removals in 
      periods of low levels. Diversions during droughts would be difficult to 
      interrupt because of the dependency that diversions create among 
      recipients. The Commission recognizes that once a diversion to a 
      water-poor area is permitted, it would be very difficult to shut it off at 
      some time in the future.<BR><BR><EM>13. Current Bulk Removals</EM>. There 
      are not, at present, significant removals of water from the Great Lakes 
      Basin by truck. There is no trade in water from the Great Lakes by marine 
      tanker, although the Nova Group in 1998 did seek a permit to ship 600 
      million liters (159 million gallons) of water annually from Lake Superior 
      to Asia. Moreover, despite the increase that has occurred in the market 
      for bottled water, the volume of water leaving the Great Lakes Basin in 
      bottles is not significant (the amount of bottled water presently imported 
      into the Basin exceeds the amount leaving by a factor of 14). The amount 
      of ballast water currently leaving the Basin is not sufficient to cause 
      damage to the Basin ecosystem. There is nevertheless a need to monitor 
      these activities and keep them under review.<BR><BR><EM>14. 
      Groundwater.</EM> There is uncertainty and a lack of adequate data about 
      groundwater and use of groundwater in the Basin. Data on withdrawals vary 
      in quality, while data on consumption are extremely limited. It is 
      estimated that about 5 percent of all withdrawals in the Basin are from 
      groundwater. Current estimates of consumption of groundwater do not 
      indicate that this consumption is a major factor with respect to Great 
      Lakes levels. Nevertheless, it is a matter of considerable importance to 
      more than 20 percent of the Basin's human population and to the large 
      biological community that rely on groundwater and that can be 
      significantly affected by local withdrawals. There is a serious lack of 
      information on groundwater in the Basin, and governments should undertake 
      the necessary research to meet this need. There is clear need for state, 
      provincial, and local government attention to the monitoring and 
      regulation of groundwater withdrawals and protection of groundwater 
      recharge areas.<BR><BR><EM>15. Human Interventions</EM>. Human activities 
      beyond water removals and consumption have had impacts on the natural 
      environment of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Land use changes, water 
      pollution, regulation of lake levels, channel work for navigation, 
      construction of dams, other activities, and development of wetlands can 
      affect water levels, destroy habitat, and modify hydrologic 
      regimes.<BR><BR><STRONG>Great Lakes Basin Laws and Policies 
      </STRONG><BR><BR><EM>16. Cooperative Efforts</EM>. The Great Lakes Basin 
      extends across the boundary between Canada and the United States and the 
      borders of eight states and of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. None 
      of these governments alone can regulate water in the entire Basin. The 
      Great Lakes are an integrated hydrologic system. When water is removed 
      from the Basin on one side of the international boundary by either 
      consumptive use or removals, the amount of water that is available on both 
      sides is reduced. Measures to protect and conserve the waters of the Great 
      Lakes ecosystem must therefore be directed at the Basin as a whole in 
      order to be effective. This requires cooperation and coordination among 
      the governments with responsibilities in the Basin.<BR><BR><EM>17. The

              <LI>At the international level, the waters of the Great Lakes are 
              subject to the requirements of the Boundary Waters Treaty, which 
              has established a binational regime that has been in place since 
              1909. The treaty requires, among other things, a special agreement 
              between the governments of Canada and the United States or 
              approval of the International Joint Commission for uses of 
              boundary waters that affect levels or flows on the other side of 
              the border. It also provides that each country reserves exclusive 
              jurisdiction and control over tributaries of boundary waters.<BR>
              <LI>The Boundary Waters Treaty, after 90 years, continues to 
              provide effective protection for both countries from abuses to the 
              waters of the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem. It represents a proven 
              regime for avoiding and resolving disputes that arise between 
              Canada and the United States over boundary waters and 
              transboundary rivers.<BR>
              <LI>The Boundary Waters Treaty is buttressed by the Great Lakes 
              Water Quality Agreement, which the governments of Canada and the 
              United States signed in 1978. The objective of that agreement is 
              to protect the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the 
              waters of the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem.

      <P><EM>20. Conservation Management</EM>. Conservation of water by using it 
      more efficiently makes sound economic and environmental sense. Little has 
      been done by the states and provinces to implement the conservation 
      provisions of the Great Lakes Basin Water Resources Management Program, to 
      which they are committed under the Great Lakes Charter. The states and 
      provinces need to make a commitment to move forward vigorously with 
      conservation programs.<BR><BR><EM>21. Data Monitoring and Collection.</EM> 
      Sound management of the water resources of the Great Lakes requires sound 
      data about these resources. Although the Great Lakes Charter provides a 
      structure for the collection, analysis, and distribution of these data, 
      progress in the data management area has been very slow. The states and 
      provinces have failed to maintain adequate databases needed to make 
      appropriate decisions concerning the management of the waters of the Great 
      Lakes Basin. In addition, current monitoring arrangements are inadequate 
      to support such decisions and to assess cumulative effects of water use. 
      The federal governments, the Great Lakes states, and the provinces are 
      underfunding data collection and management and, as a result, must use 
      outdated and inadequate information in their decision-making process. This 
      calls into question the soundness of governments' decisions. The 
      uncertainty of future water supply makes adequate data collection and 
      management an absolute necessity.<BR><BR><EM>22. Legal Limitations</EM>. 
      There are now laws in both countries that, in different ways, limit 
      removals of water from the Great Lakes Basin. These laws, however, apply 
      only in the jurisdictions that enacted them; they can be changed by those 
      jurisdictions at any time and do not constitute a binational 
      regime.<BR><BR><EM>23. Trade Law.</EM> International trade law 
      obligations—including the provisions of the Canada–United States Free 
      Trade Agreement (FTA), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
      and World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, including the General 
      Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)—do not prevent Canada and the United 
      States from taking measures to protect their water resources and preserve 
      the integrity of the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem. Such measures are not 
      prohibited so long as there is no discrimination by decision makers 
      against persons from other countries in their application, and so long as 
      water management policies are clearly articulated and consistently 
      implemented so that undue expectations are not created. Canada and the 
      United States cannot be compelled by trade laws to endanger the waters of 
      the Great Lakes ecosystem. The public, however, remains deeply concerned 
      that international trade law could affect the protection of these 
      waters.</P>
      <P><BR><STRONG>Principles</STRONG><BR><BR>24. To ensure the protection and 
      conservation of the waters of the Great Lakes, the Commission concludes 
      that the following principles should guide their 
      management:<BR><BR><EM>Integrity of the Ecosystem</EM>: The Great Lakes 
      Basin is an integrated and fragile ecosystem. Its surface and groundwater 
      resources are part of a single hydrologic system and should be dealt with 
      as a unified whole in ways that take into account water quantity, water 
      quality, and ecosystem integrity.<BR><BR><EM>The Precautionary 
      Approach</EM>: Because there is uncertainty about the availability of 
      Great Lakes water in the future—in the light of previous variations in 
      climatic conditions as well as potential climate change, uncertainty about 
      the demands that may be placed on that water, uncertainty about the 
      reliability of existing data, and uncertainty about the extent to which 
      removals and consumptive use harm, perhaps irreparably, the integrity of 
      the Basin ecosystem—caution should be used in managing water to protect 
      the resource for the future. There should be a bias in favor of retaining 
      water in the system and using it more efficiently and 
      effectively.<BR><BR><EM>Sustainability</EM>: Water and related resources 
      of the Basin should be used and managed to meet present needs, while not 
      foreclosing options for future generations to meet their cultural, 
      economic, environmental, and social needs.<BR><BR><EM>Water 
      Conservation:</EM> There should be an obligation to apply the best 
      conservation and demand-management practices to reduce water use and 
      consumptive losses and thus retain water in the 
      Basin.<BR><BR><EM>Cooperation:</EM> Decisions regarding management of 
      water resources must involve cooperation among the two federal 
      governments, the Great Lakes states and provinces, the tribes and 
      Aboriginal Peoples, the municipalities and regions, and the citizenry on 
      both sides of the boundary. The processes must be open to involvement and 
      meaningful participation by these governments, the stakeholders, and the 
      public. <BR><BR><EM>Existing Institutions:</EM> Existing institutions, 
      processes, and legal instruments—including the Boundary Waters Treaty, the 
      International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes Charter, the U.S. Water 
      Resources Development Act, the Ontario Water Taking and Transfer 
      Regulation, and the Great Lakes Commission—have provided vehicles to deal 
      with water use issues. It is important to retain these strengths in any 
      new process. Moreover, it is important to continue to respect existing 
      international agreements and arrangements and the rights of tribes and 
      Aboriginal Peoples.<BR><BR><EM>Measurable Objectives, Sound Science, and 
      Adaptive Management:</EM> Water resource goals should, whenever possible, 
      be established as measurable objectives that can be assessed through open, 
      objective, scientific studies that are subject to peer review. Where 
      information is incomplete, particularly with respect to emerging issues of 
      concern, decisions should be based on the precautionary approach and 
      should take into account the best available data, information, and 
      knowledge, including cultural, economic, environmental, and social 
      values.<BR><BR><EM>Fairness:</EM> The Great Lakes Basin community is 
      broad, diverse, and interdependent. Culturally and economically, it 
      extends beyond the physical confines of the hydrologic basin. It is 
      important that programs designed to protect the ecological foundation of 
      the Basin community be, and be seen to be, fair to all those who use and 
      contribute to the Basin and are part of the community.</P>

      on a binational basis, research is coordinated on individual and 
      cumulative impacts of water withdrawals on the integrity of the Great 
      Lakes Basin ecosystem. In support of their decision-making, governments 
      should implement long-term monitoring programs capable of detecting 
      threats (including cumulative threats) to ecosystem integrity. Such 
      monitoring programs should be comprehensive, particularly in their 
      approaches to detecting threats to ecosystem integrity at a spectrum of 
      space and time scales.<BR><BR>As part of an anticipatory policy for

      <P>In recognition of the frequent and pervasive interaction between 
      groundwater and surface water and the virtual impossibility of 
      distinguishing between them in some instances, governments should apply 
      the precautionary principle with respect to removals and consumptive use 
      of groundwater in the Basin.<BR><BR><STRONG>Recommendation VIII. Climate 
      Change</STRONG><BR><BR>Recognizing that the Intergovernmental Panel on 
      Climate Change has concluded that human activities are having a 
      discernible effect on global climate, and despite the uncertainties 
      associated with the modeling of future climate, the governments of Canada 
      and the United States should fully implement their international 
      commitments to reduce greenhouse gas 
      emissions.<BR><BR><STRONG>Recommendation IX. Trade Law 
      </STRONG><BR><BR>The governments of the United States and Canada should 
      direct more effort to allaying the public's concern that international 
      trade law obligations could prevent Canada and the United States from 
      taking measures to protect waters in the boundary region, and they also 
      need to direct more effort to bringing greater clarity and consensus to 
      the issue. <BR><BR><STRONG>Recommendation X. Standing 
      Reference</STRONG><BR><BR>The Commission should be given a standing 
      reference to review its recommendations for the protection of the waters 
      of the Great Lakes in three years and thereafter at 10-year intervals 
      unless conditions dictate a more frequent 
      review.<BR><BR><STRONG>Recommendation XI. Next Steps</STRONG><BR><BR>The 
      Commission recommends that the governments consider for adoption the 
      proposed plan of work for Commission activities on the rest of the border, 
      focusing on priority issues and on specific regional issues where the 
      Commission can contribute binational experience and 
      resources.<BR><BR><STRONG>Recommendation XII. 
      Implementation</STRONG><BR><BR>The Commission recommends that the 
      governments of the United States and Canada and the governments of the 
      Great Lakes states and Ontario and Quebec, acting individually or 
      collectively, as appropriate, take the necessary steps to implement the 
      recommendations contained in this report.</P>
