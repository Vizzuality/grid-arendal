<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Information on quantity and quality of freshwater and its availability and 
use is essential for sustainable development. Considering that a major share of 
the world's water resources is used for agricultural production, and water 
development plays a key role in increasing food production and achieving food 
security, information on agricultural water use has assumed greater importance. 
Reliable data are also required for joint management of internationally shared 
water resources. The "thirst" for water data is ever increasing and there is 
indeed considerable demand for data on rural water use from national governments 
and development agencies.</P>
<P>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations initiated an 
activity in 1993 to meet this demand with particular focus on irrigation. This 
resulted in the AQUASTAT Programme, the objective of which is to generate rural 
water use data at country and subcountry level in a systematic manner. It was 
decided to give priority to the countries of the African continent, in view of 
the urgent need to promote irrigation development for food security in most 
countries of the continent.</P>
<P>The 53 countries of the African continent were surveyed in 1994-94, which 
resulted in FAO Water Report 7 "Irrigation in Africa in Figures". In 1995-96 the 
Near East region, which concentrates most of the complex water allocation issues 
of the world, was surveyed, resulting in FAO Water Report 9 "Irrigation in the 
Near East Region in Figures". In 1997, the 15 countries of the Former Soviet 
Union were surveyed and FAO Water Report 15 "Irrigation in the Countries of the 
Former Soviet Union in Figures" was published. In 1998-99 a fourth series of 
countries were surveyed, covering the countries of Asia not included in the two 
previous reports on the Near East (Water Report 9) and on the former Soviet 
Union (Water Report 15). Water Report 20 is the most recent and came out in 
2000. It covers the Latin American and Caribbean countries. </P>
<P>In this section the background of the AQUASTAT survey is described, covering
