      Middle East region is characterised by an arid and semi arid environment. 
      Being at a junction between three continents it is considered as one of 
      the most diverse areas on earth. The region includes the following 22 
      countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, 
      Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, 
      Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, UAE and Yemen.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>The region is characterized by variations in elevation 
      ranging from the lowest point on earth at the Dead Sea area (more than 300 
      m below sea level) to high mountains rising above 3000 m above sea level. 
      The vertical and the horizontal variation from north to south create high 
      biological diversity. The marine components in the region also reflect 
      great diversity, centered on the Mediterranean Sea, but including the 
      Atlantic Ocean, the Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf, the Arabian Sea, 
      Black Sea, Caspian Sea and the Indian Ocean. The variation in ecosystems 
      across the region is reflected by high diversity in flora and fauna. 
      Endemism is considerably high particularly among marine invertebrates and 
      in some hot spots like the Socotra Islands of Yemen.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>The region features a unique experience in land 
      management for conserving natural resources, which is the <I>hema</I> 
      system. <I>Hema</I> is an Arabic word, which means an area that is 
      protected. The concept of <I>hema</I> is demonstrated in the practice of 
      setting aside and protecting an area with good vegetation cover. Such an 
      action was usually taken by a governing authority, a group of people (a 
      tribe or a clan), or an individual. Those sites were mostly protected for 
      grazing during drought seasons and in other instances for multiple use 
      such as bee- keeping and for the protection of large trees. Grazing and 
      other uses, such as cutting grasses for fodder, were banned most of the 
      time and only allowed with restrictions and under certain regulations set 
      by those who established or managed the <I>hema</I>.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>The practice of <I>hema</I> dates back, in the Arabian 
      Peninsula, to the pre-Islamic era. It probably goes as far back in history 
      as 2000 years ago or maybe more. It developed as an acknowledgment of the 
      need to conserve and wisely use scarce renewable resources.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>In 1969, it was estimated that there were more than 
      3000 <I>hema</I> in Saudi Arabia. Later, a survey was conducted in 1984 in 
      the mountain areas west of Saudi Arabia (where most of the <I>hema</I> 
      existed) and only 71 <I>hema</I> were found, under various degrees of 
      protection.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>The main aim of the WCPA regional program is to ensure 
      that protected areas effectively fulfil their role in conserving 
      biodiversity and to contribute to sustainable development. Moreover, the 
      program aims to assist governments of the region in meeting their 
      obligations regarding the implementation of the Convention on Biological 
      Diversity and other related conventions. A WCPA Regional Action Plan has 
      been completed and will be considered part of the next IUCN regional 
      programme.</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Times>The objectives of the WCPA Regional Action Plan and 
      the associated project proposals for North Africa and the Middle East, 
      are:</FONT> 
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face=Times>To develop and implement protected area training 
        programmes in the region targeted largely at the managers of particular 
        sites;</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Times>To develop more effective and appropriate protected 
        area legislation at a national level, which reflect the needs and unique 
        circumstances of each country and is capable of implementation;</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Times>To develop a number of pilot protected areas in the 
        region as well as guidelines for their more effective establishment and 
        long-term management; and</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Times>To develop guidelines related to ecotourism and 
        protected areas in the region.</FONT> </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face=Times><B>Training</B><BR>The lack of skilled staff is a 
      major constraint to the effective establishment and management of 
      protected areas in the region. The management of many protected areas 
      falls below acceptable international standards. Such disciplines as 
      protected area planning and management, wildlife management and 
      environmental sociology are not yet widely recognised by the region's 
      academic institutions. One training centre has recently been established 
      in the region, but there are almost no university courses or degree 
      programs in the subjects most closely related to protected area 
      management.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>Skills are particularly needed in the following areas: 
      involvement of local stakeholders; conflict resolution; planning and 
      management of protected areas including marine protected areas; 
      application of information arising from research and monitoring 
      programmes; and development of environmental awareness and education 
      programmes. The development of skills must embrace legal and 
      socio-economic as well as ecological aspects of protected area 
      management.</FONT>

      focus of training must be on those directly involved in the management of 
      protected areas, such as upper level managers and administrators, middle 
      level managers, researchers, rangers, and tourist guides, however, there 
      are other important target groups. These should include decision-makers 
      and legislators who work in other agencies but whose decisions may 
      influence the establishment and management of protected areas. They should 
      also include local stakeholders, educators, women, and youth.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times><B>Legislation</B><BR>The legislative basis for 
      protected areas is still weak in the region. Even though most countries 
      have some protected area legislation, others do not have enough provisions 
      to make creative use of the region's rich heritage of traditional 
      institutions and indigenous conservation practices. There are also few 
      provisions to involve local citizens as participants in the establishment 
      and management of protected areas, or to ensure that any benefits 
      generated from the use of protected areas be equitably shared with the 
      local people. In many instances, implementation and enforcement are given 
      insufficient attention.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times><B>Pilot Protected Areas</B><BR>There is an acute need 
      to expand the protected area systems of the region to represent those 
      biotopes where there is no protection, and to conserve endangered endemic 
      and relict species of plants and animals, as well as species of special 
      ecological, economic, or cultural value. Especially important is the need 
      to conserve those key sites of biological productivity - the wetlands, 
      mountains and woodlands, and the coastal sites - that constitute the 
      habitats of the majority of the region's flora and fauna.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>Equally great is the need to manage protected areas or 
      suitable parts of them, in a manner that brings sustainable and tangible 
      benefits to the local people who have in many cases been disadvantaged by 
      their establishment. Such benefits will give these people incentives to 
      become partners in conservation.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>Broad agreement and commitment to these objectives 
      exists among conservation agencies within the region. But there is a need 
      for highly successful pilot or "model" protected areas that are effective 
      in conserving the region's biological diversity and at the same time 
      demonstrating how community participation in the management of protected 
      areas can bring tangible sustainable benefits.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times><B>Ecotourism</B><BR>One of the most promising ways 
      for protected areas to generate tangible and sustainable benefits is from 
      nature-based tourism. Ecotourism can provide a meaningful incentive and 
      economic justification for conservation, as it depends on the maintenance 
      of unspoiled nature and thriving communities of wild plants and animals. 
      In addition, it can generate an influential and articulate clientele who 
      can serve as advocates for the conservation of protected areas. If it is 
      not managed very carefully, however, nature-based tourism tends to degrade 
      the very resources upon which it depends, and this has been happening in 
      the region.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), one 
      of five major tourism trends will be an important growth in adventure 
      tourism and in ecotourism. The same organization also forecasts solid 
      growth in cultural tourism and North Africa and the Middle East are among 
      the regions where this is expected to happen in the near future.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Times>It is, therefore, critical that tourism be carefully 
      planned to ensure that such developments and activities do not compromise 
      the natural and cultural values for which protected areas were established 
      in the first place. This can only be ensured through effective management 
      of these areas. Emphasis also needs to be placed on the development of 
      strong partnerships between protected area agencies and tourism agencies, 
      including commercial operators.</FONT>
