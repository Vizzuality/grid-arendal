<H2>Executive Summary </H2>
<P><I>CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration trends and budgets</I></P>
<P>Before the Industrial Era, circa 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide 
(CO<SUB>2</SUB>) concentration was 280 ± 10 ppm for several thousand years. It 
has risen continuously since then, reaching 367 ppm in 1999. <BR><BR>The present 
atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration has not been exceeded during the past 
420,000 years, and likely not during the past 20 million years. The rate of 
increase over the past century is unprecedented, at least during the past 20,000 
years. <BR><BR>The present atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase is caused by 
anthropogenic emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. About three-quarters of these 
emissions are due to fossil fuel burning. Fossil fuel burning (plus a small 
contribution from cement production) released on average 5.4 ± 0.3 PgC/yr during 
1980 to 1989, and 6.3 ± 0.4 PgC/yr during 1990 to 1999. Land use change is 
responsible for the rest of the emissions.<BR><BR>The rate of increase of 
atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> content was 3.3 ± 0.1 PgC/yr during 1980 to 1989 and 
3.2 ± 0.1 PgC/yr during 1990 to 1999. These rates are less than the emissions, 
because some of the emitted CO<SUB>2</SUB> dissolves in the oceans, and some is 
taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. Individual years show different rates of 
increase. For example, 1992 was low (1.9 PgC/yr), and 1998 was the highest (6.0 
PgC/yr) since direct measurements began in 1957. This variability is mainly 
caused by variations in land and ocean uptake.<BR><BR>Statistically, high rates 
of increase in atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> have occurred in most El Niño years, 
although low rates occurred during the extended El Niño of 1991 to 1994. Surface 
water CO<SUB>2</SUB> measurements from the equatorial Pacific show that the 
natural source of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from this region is reduced by between 0.2 and 
1.0 PgC/yr during El Niño events, counter to the atmospheric increase. It is 
likely that the high rates of CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase during most El Niño events 
are explained by reductions in land uptake, caused in part by the effects of 
high temperatures, drought and fire on terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics. 
<BR><BR>Land and ocean uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> can now be separated using 
atmospheric measurements (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, oxygen (O<SUB>2</SUB>) and 
13CO<SUB>2</SUB>). For 1980 to 1989, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as 
-1.9 ± 0.6 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as -0.2 ± 0.7 PgC/yr based on 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>2</SUB> measurements (negative signs denote net 
uptake). For 1990 to 1999, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as -1.7 ± 0.5 
PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as -1.4 ± 0.7 PgC/yr. These figures are 
consistent with alternative budgets based on CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 13CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
measurements, and with independent estimates based on measurements of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 13CO<SUB>2</SUB> in sea water. The new 1980s estimates are 
also consistent with the ocean-model based carbon budget of the IPCC WGI Second 
Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996a) (hereafter SAR). The new 1990s estimates update 
the budget derived using SAR methodologies for the IPCC Special Report on Land 
Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a).<BR><BR>The net CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
release due to land-use change during the 1980s has been estimated as 0.6 to 2.5 
PgC/yr (central estimate 1.7 PgC/yr). This net CO<SUB>2</SUB> release is mainly 
due to deforestation in the tropics. Uncertainties about land-use changes limit 
the accuracy of these estimates. Comparable data for the 1990s are not yet 
available. <BR><BR>The land-atmosphere flux estimated from atmospheric 
observations comprises the balance of net CO<SUB>2</SUB> release due to land-use 
changes and CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake by terrestrial systems (the &#8220;residual 
terrestrial sink&#8221;). The residual terrestrial sink is estimated as -1.9 PgC/yr 
(range -3.8 to +0.3 PgC/yr) during the 1980s. It has several likely causes, 
including changes in land management practices and fertilisation effects of 
increased atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> and nitrogen (N) deposition, leading to 
increased vegetation and soil carbon.<BR><BR>Modelling based on atmospheric 
observations (inverse modelling) enables the land-atmosphere and 
ocean-atmosphere fluxes to be partitioned between broad latitudinal bands. The 
sites of anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake in the ocean are not resolved by 
inverse modelling because of the large, natural background air-sea fluxes 
(outgassing in the tropics and uptake in high latitudes). Estimates of the 
land-atmosphere flux north of 30°N during 1980 to 1989 range from -2.3 to -0.6 
PgC/yr; for the tropics, -1.0 to +1.5 PgC/yr. These results imply substantial 
terrestrial sinks for anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the northern 
extra-tropics, and in the tropics (to balance deforestation). The pattern for 
the 1980s persisted into the 1990s. <BR><BR>Terrestrial carbon inventory data 
indicate carbon sinks in northern and tropical forests, consistent with the 
results of inverse modelling.<BR><BR>East-west gradients of atmospheric 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration are an order of magnitude smaller than north-south 
gradients. Estimates of continental-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> balance are possible in 
principle but are poorly constrained because there are too few well-calibrated 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> monitoring sites, especially in the interior of continents, and 
insufficient data on air-sea fluxes and vertical transport in the 
atmosphere.</P>
<P><I>The global carbon cycle and anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB></I></P>
<P>The global carbon cycle operates through a variety of response and feedback 
mechanisms. The most relevant for decade to century time-scales are listed 
here.</P>
<P>Responses of the carbon cycle to changing CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Uptake of anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> by the ocean is primarily governed 
  by ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry. So long as atmospheric 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration is increasing there is net uptake of carbon by 
  the ocean, driven by the atmosphere-ocean difference in partial pressure of 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The fraction of anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> that is taken up 
  by the ocean declines with increasing CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration, due to 
  reduced buffer capacity of the carbonate system. The fraction taken up by the 
  ocean also declines with the rate of increase of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 
  because the rate of mixing between deep water and surface water limits 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake. 
  <LI>Increasing atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> has no significant fertilisation 
  effect on marine biological productivity, but it decreases pH. Over a century, 
  changes in marine biology brought about by changes in calcification at low pH 
  could increase the ocean uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> by a few percentage points. 
  <LI>Terrestrial uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is governed by net biome production 
  (NBP), which is the balance of net primary production (NPP) and carbon losses 
  due to heterotrophic respiration (decomposition and herbivory) and fire, 
  including the fate of harvested biomass. NPP increases when atmospheric 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration is increased above present levels (the 
  &#8220;fertilisation&#8221; effect occurs directly through enhanced photo-synthesis, and 
  indirectly through effects such as increased water use efficiency). At high 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration (800 to 1,000 ppm) any further direct 
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> fertilisation effect is likely to be small. The effectiveness 
  of terrestrial uptake as a carbon sink depends on the transfer of carbon to 
  forms with long residence times (wood or modified soil organic matter). 
  Management practices can enhance the carbon sink because of the inertia of 
  these &#8220;slow&#8221; carbon pools. </LI></UL>
<P>Feedbacks in the carbon cycle due to climate change</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Warming reduces the solubility of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and therefore reduces 
  uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> by the ocean. 
  <LI>Increased vertical stratification in the ocean is likely to accompany 
  increasing global temperature. The likely consequences include reduced 
  outgassing of upwelled CO<SUB>2</SUB>, reduced transport of excess carbon to 
  the deep ocean, and changes in biological productivity. 
  <LI>On short time-scales, warming increases the rate of heterotrophic 
  respiration on land, but the extent to which this effect can alter 
  land-atmosphere fluxes over longer time-scales is not yet clear. Warming, and 
  regional changes in precipitation patterns and cloudiness, are also likely to 
  bring about changes in terrestrial ecosystem structure, geographic 
  distribution and primary production. The net effect of climate on NBP depends 
  on regional patterns of climate change. </LI></UL>
<P>Other impacts on the carbon cycle</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Changes in management practices are very likely to have significant 
  effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In addition to deforestation and 
  afforestation/reforestation, more subtle management effects can be important. 
  For example, fire suppression (e.g., in savannas) reduces CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
  emissions from burning, and encourages woody plant biomass to increase. On 
  agricultural lands, some of the soil carbon lost when land was cleared and 
  tilled can be regained through adoption of low-tillage agriculture. 
  <LI>Anthropogenic N deposition is increasing terrestrial NPP in some regions; 
  excess tropospheric ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) is likely to be reducing NPP. 
  <LI>Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the oceans by rivers and atmospheric 
  dust may influence marine biological productivity, although such effects are 
  poorly quantified. </LI></UL>
<P><I>Modelling and projection of CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration</I></P>
<P>Process-based models of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycling have been 
developed, compared and tested against in situ measurements and atmospheric 
measurements. The following are consistent results based on several models.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Modelled ocean-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in the range -1.5 
  to -2.2 PgC/yr for the 1980s, consistent with earlier model estimates and 
  consistent with the atmospheric budget. 
  <LI>Modelled land-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in the range -0.3 to 
  -1.5 PgC/yr, consistent with or slightly more negative than the 
  land-atmosphere flux as indicated by the atmospheric budget. CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
  fertilisation and anthropogenic N deposition effects contributed 
  significantly: their combined effect was estimated as -1.5 to -3.1 PgC/yr. 
  Effects of climate change during the 1980s were small, and of uncertain sign. 
  <LI>In future projections with ocean models, driven by CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
  concentrations derived from the IS92a scenario (for illustration and 
  comparison with earlier work), ocean uptake becomes progressively larger 
  towards the end of the century, but represents a smaller fraction of emissions 
  than today. When climate change feedbacks are included, ocean uptake becomes 
  less in all models, when compared with the situation without climate 
  feedbacks. 
  <LI>In analogous projections with terrestrial models, the rate of uptake by 
  the land due to CO<SUB>2</SUB> fertilisation increases until mid-century, but 
  the models project smaller increases, or no increase, after that time. When 
  climate change feedbacks are included, land uptake becomes less in all models, 
  when compared with the situation without climate feedbacks. Some models have 
  shown a rapid decline in carbon uptake after the mid-century. </LI></UL>
<P>Two simplified, fast models (ISAM and Bern-CC) were used to project future 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations under IS92a and six SRES scenarios, and to project 

future emissions under five CO<SUB>2</SUB> stabilisation scenarios. Both models 
represent ocean and terrestrial climate feedbacks, in a way consistent with 
process-based models, and allow for uncertainties in climate sensitivity and in 
ocean and terrestrial responses to CO<SUB>2</SUB> and climate.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The reference case projections (which include climate feedbacks) of both 
  models under IS92a are, by coincidence, close to those made in the SAR (which 
  neglected feedbacks). 
  <LI>The SRES scenarios lead to divergent CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration 
  trajectories. Among the six emissions scenarios considered, the projected 
  range of CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations at the end of the century is 550 to 970 
  ppm (ISAM model) or 540 to 960 ppm (Bern-CC model). 
  <LI>Variations in climate sensitivity and ocean and terrestrial model 
  responses add at least -10 to +30% uncertainty to these values, and to the 
  emissions implied by the stabilisation scenarios. 
  <LI>The net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks is always to increase 
  projected atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. This is equivalent to 
  reducing the allowable emissions for stabilisation at any one CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
  concentration. 
  <LI>New studies with general circulation models including interactive land and 
  ocean carbon cycle components also indicate that climate feedbacks have the 
  potential to increase atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> but with large uncertainty 
  about the magnitude of the terrestrial biosphere feedback. </LI></UL>
<P><I>Implications</I></P>
<P>CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from fossil fuel burning are virtually certain to be 
the dominant factor determining CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations during the 21st 
century. There is scope for land-use changes to increase or decrease 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations on this time-scale. If all of the carbon so far 
released by land-use changes could<BR>be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> at the end of the century would be 40 to 70 ppm less than it 
would be if no such intervention had occurred. By comparison, global 
deforestation would add two to four times more CO<SUB>2</SUB> to the atmosphere 
than reforestation of all cleared areas would subtract.</P>
<P>There is sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to 80% of 
foreseeable anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions to the atmosphere, this 
process takes centuries due to the rate of ocean mixing. As a result, even 
several centuries after emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase in 
concentration caused by these emissions is still present in the atmosphere. 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1,000 ppm would require global 
anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions to drop below 1990 levels, within a few 
decades, about a century, or about two centuries respectively, and continue to 
steadily decrease thereafter. Stabilisation requires that net anthropogenic 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions ultimately decline to the level of persistent natural 
land and ocean<BR>sinks, which are expected to be small (&lt;0.2 PgC/yr).</P>
