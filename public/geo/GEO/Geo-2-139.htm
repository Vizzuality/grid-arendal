<CENTER><B>WHAT IS THE BOUNDARY WATERS TREATY?</B> </CENTER>
<P>Signed in 1909, it provides the principles and mechanisms to help resolve 
disputes and to prevent future ones, primarily those concerning water quantity 
and water quality along the boundary between Canada and the United States. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>HOW IS THE PUBLIC INVOLVED WITH <BR>INTERNATIONAL JOINT COMMISSION 
ACTIVITIES?</B> </CENTER>
<P>The Boundary Waters Treaty requires that the Commission give all interested 
parties a "convenient opportunity to be heard" on matters under consideration. 
The Commission invites public participation and advice when it undertakes 
studies under References, when it deals with Orders of Approval and when it 
prepares reports to Governments. 
<P>In many instances, citizens, both specialists and non-specialists, also serve 
on Commission boards and task forces. 
<P>The Commission is specifically authorized to develop a public information 
program under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. 
<P>Informing the public of boundary water issues before the Commission is an 
important aspect of the work and ways to enhance the Commission's role in this 
area are continually explored. 
<P>Information materials are produced on various topics; these materials and 
Commission reports are available from and IJC office.

<CENTER><B>TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN RELATING TO 
BOUNDARY WATERS, AND QUESTIONS ARISING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
CANADA</CENTER></B>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<P>The United States of America and His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, 
Emperor of India, being equally desirous to prevent disputes regarding the use 
of boundary waters and to settle all questions which are now pending between the 
United States and the Dominion of Canada involving the rights, obligations, or 
interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, 
along their common frontier, and to make provision for the adjustment and 
settlement of all such questions as may hereafter arise, have resolved to 
conclude a treaty in furtherance of these ends, and for that purpose have 
appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries: 
<P>The President of the United States of America, Elihu Root, Secretary of State 
of the United States; and His Britannic Majesty, the Right Honourable James 
Bryce, O.M., his Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Washington; 
<P>Who, after having communicated to one another their full powers, found in 
good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles: 
<P><B>PRELIMINARY ARTICLE</B> 
<P>For the purpose of this treaty boundary waters are defined as the waters from 
main shore to main shore of the lakes and rivers and connecting waterways, or 
the portions thereof, along which the international boundary between the United 
States and the Dominion of Canada passes, including all bays, arms, and inlets 
thereof, but not including tributary waters which in their natural channels 
would flow into such lakes, rivers, and waterways, or waters flowing from such 
lakes, rivers, and waterways, or the waters of rivers flowing across the 
boundary. 
<P><B>ARTICLE I</B> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties agree that the navigation of all navigable 
boundary waters shall forever continue free and open for the purposes of 
commerce to the inhabitants and to the ships, vessels, and boats of both 
countries equally, subject, however, to any laws and regulations of either 
country, within its own territory, not inconsistent with such privilege of free 
navigation and applying equally and without discrimination to the inhabitants, 
ships, vessels, and boats of both countries.
<P>It is further agreed that so long as this treaty shall remain in force, this 
same right of navigation shall extend to the waters of Lake Michigan and to all 
canals connecting boundary waters, and now existing or which may hereafter be 
constructed on either side of the line. Either of the High Contracting Parties 
may adopt rules and regulations governing the use of such canals within its own 
territory and may charge tolls for the use thereof, but all such rules and 
regulations and all tolls charged shall apply alike to the subjects or citizens 
of the High Contracting Parties and the ships, vessels, and boats of both of the 
High Contracting Parties, and they shall be placed on terms of equality in the 
use thereof. 
<P><B>ARTICLE II</B> 
<P>Each of the High Contracting Parties reserves to itself or to the several 
State Governments on the one side and the Dominion or Provincial Governments on 
the other as the case may be, subject to any treaty provisions now existing with 
respect thereto, the exclusive jurisdiction and control over the use and 
diversion, whether temporary or permanent, of all waters on its own side of the 
line which in their natural channels would flow across the boundary or into 
boundary waters; but it is agreed that any interference with or diversion from 
their natural channel of such waters on either side of the boundary, resulting 
in any injury on the other side of the boundary, shall give rise to the same 
rights and entitle the injured parties to the same legal remedies as if such 
injury took place in the country where such diversion or interference occurs; 
but this provision shall not apply to cases already existing or to cases 
expressly covered by special agreement between the parties hereto. It is 
understood however, that neither of the High Contracting Parties intends by the 
foregoing provision to surrender any right, which it may have, to object to any 
interference with or diversions of waters on the other side of the boundary the 
effect of which would be productive of material injury to the navigation 
interests on its own side of the boundary. 
<P><A name=art3><B>ARTICLE III </B></A>
<P>It is agreed that, in addition to the uses, obstructions, and diversions 
heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by special agreement between the 
Parties hereto, no further or other uses or obstructions or diversions, whether 
temporary or permanent, of boundary waters on either side of the line, affecting 
the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the other side of the line shall 
be mae except by authority of the United States or the Dominion of Canada within 
their respective jurisdictions and with the approval, as hereinafter provided, 
of a joint commission, to be known as the International Joint Commission.
<P>The foregoing provisions are not intended to limit or interfere with the 
existing rights of the Government of the United States on the one side and the 
Government of the Dominion of Canada on the other, to undertake and carry on 
governmental works in boundary waters for the deepening of channels, the 
construction of breakwaters, the improvement of harbours, and other governmental 
works for the benefit of commerce and navigation, provided that such works are 
wholly on its own side of the line and do not materially affect the level or 
flow of the boundary waters on the other, nor are such provisions intended to 
interfere with the ordinary use of such waters for domestic and sanitary 
purposes. 
<P><A name=art4><B>ARTICLE IV</B></A> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties agree that, except in cases provided for by 
special agreement between them, they will not permit the construction of 
maintenance on their respective sides of the boundary of any remedial or 
protective works or any dams or other obstructions in waters flowing from 
boundary waters or in waters at a lower level than the boundary in rivers 
flowing across the boundary, the effect of which is to raise the natural level 
of waters on the other side of the boundary unless the construction or 
maintenance thereof is approved by the aforesaid International Joint Commission.
<P>It is further agreed that the waters herein defined as boundary waters and 
waters flowing across the boundary shall not be polluted on either side to the 
injury of health or property on the other. 
<P><B>ARTICLE V</B> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties agree that it is expedient to limit the 
diversion of waters from the Niagara River so that the level of Lake Erie and 
the flow of the stream shall not be appreciably affected. It is the desire of 
both Parties to accomplish this object with the least possible injury to 
investments which have already been made in the construction of power plants on 
the United States side of the river under grants of authority from State of New 
York, and on the Canadian side of the river under licences authorized by the 
Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario. 
<P>So long as this treaty shall remain in force, no diversion of the waters of 
the Niagara River above the Falls from the natural course and stream thereof 
shall be permitted except for the purposes and to the extent hereinafter 
provided. 
<P>
<LI>The United States may authorize and permit the diversion within the State of 
New York of the waters of said river above the Falls of Niagara, for power 
purposes, not exceeding in the aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of twenty 
thousand cubic feet of water per second.
<P></P>
<LI>The United Kingdom, by the Dominion of Canada, or the Province of Ontario, 
may authorize and permit the diversion within the Province of Ontario of the 
waters of said rive above the Falls of Niagara, for the power purposes, not 
exceeding in the aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of thirty-six thousand 
cubic feet of water per second.
<P></P>
<LI>The prohibitions of this article shall not apply to the diversion of water 
for sanitary or domestic purposes, or for the service of canals for the purposes 
of navigation. 
<P>Note: The third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of Article V were terminated by 
the Canada-United States Treaty of February 27, 1950 concerning the diversion of 
the Niagara River. 
<P><B>ARTICLE VI</B> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties agree that the St. Mary and Milk Rivers and 
their tributaries (in the State of Montana and the Provinces of Alberta and 
Saskatchewan) are to be treated as one stream for the purposes of irrigation and 
power, and the waters thereof shall be apportioned equally between the two 
countries, but in making such equal apportionment more than half may be taken 
from one river and less than half from the other by either country so as to 
afford a more beneficial use to each. It is further agreed that in the division 
of such waters during the irrigation season, between the 1st of April and 31st 
of October, inclusive, annually, the United States is entitled to a prior 
appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of the waters of the Milk River, or 
so much of such amount as constitutes three-fourths of its natural flow, and 
that Canada is entitled to a prior appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of 
the flow of St. Mary River, or so much of such amount as constitutes 
three-fourths of its natural flow. 
<P>The channel of the Milk River in Canada may be used at the convenience of the 
United States for the conveyance, while passing through Canadian territory, of 
waters diverted from the St. Mary River. The provisions of Article II of this 
treaty shall apply to any injury resulting to property in Canada from the 
conveyance of such waters through the Milk River. 
<P>The measurement and apportionment of the water to be used by each country 
shall from time to time be made jointly by the properly constituted reclamation 
officers of the United States and the properly constituted irrigation officers 
of His Majesty under the direction of the International Joint Commission. 
<P><B>ARTICLE VII</B> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties agree to establish and maintain an International 
Joint Commission of the Untied States and Canada composed of six commissioners, 
three on the part of the United States appointed by the President thereof, and 
three on the part of the United Kingdom appointed by His Majesty on the 
recommendation of the Governor in Council of the Dominion of Canada. 
<P><B>ARTICLE VIII</B> 
<P>This International Joint Commission shall have jurisdiction over and shall 
pass upon all cases involving the use or obstruction or diversion of the waters 
with respect to which under Article III or IV of this Treaty the approval shall 
be governed by the following rules of principles which are adopted by the High 
Contracting Parties for this purpose: 
<P>The High Contracting Parties shall have, each on its own side of the 
boundary, equal and similar rights in the use of the waters hereinbefore defined 
as boundary waters. 
<P>The following order of precedence shall be observed among the various uses 
enumerated hereinafter for these waters, and no use shall be permitted which 
tends materially to conflict with or restrain any other use which is given 
preference over it in this order of precedence: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Uses for domestic and sanitary purposes; 
  <LI>Uses for navigation, including the service of canals for the purposes of 
  navigation; 
  <LI>Uses for power and for irrigation purposes. </LI></OL>
<P>The foregoing provisions shall not apply to or disturb any existing uses of 
boundary waters on either side of the boundary. The requirement for an equal 
division may in the discretion of the Commission be suspended in cases of 
temporary diversions along boundary waters at points where such equal division 
can not be made advantageously on account of local conditions, and where such 
diversion does not diminish elsewhere the amount available for use on the other 
side. 
<P>The Commission in its discretion may make its approval in any case 
conditional upon the construction of remedial or protective works to compensate 
so far as possible for the particular use or diversion proposed, and in such 
cases may require that suitable and adequate provision, approved by the 
Commission, be made for the protection and indemnity against injury of all 
interests on the other side of the line which may be injured thereby. 
<P>In cases involving the elevation of the natural level of waters on either 
side of the line as a result of the construction or maintenance on the other 
side of remedial or protective works or dams or other obstructions in boundary 
waters flowing there from or in waters below the boundary in rivers flowing 
across the boundary, the Commission shall require, as a condition of its 
approval thereof, that suitable and adequate provision, approved by it, be made 
for the protection and indemnity of all interests on the other side of the line 
which may be injured thereby. 
<P>The majority of the Commissioners shall have power to render a decision. In 
case the Commission is evenly divided upon any question or matter presented to 
it for decision, separate reports shall be made by the Commissioners on each 
side to their own Government. The High Contracting Parties shall thereupon 
endeavour to agree upon an adjustment of the question or matter of difference, 
and if an agreement is reached between them, it shall be reduced to writing in 
the form of a protocol, and shall be communicated to the Commissioners, who 
shall take such further proceedings as may be necessary to carry out such 
agreement. 
<P><B>ARTICLE IX</B> 
<P>The High Contracting Parties further agree that any other questions or 
matters of difference arising between them involving the rights, obligations, or 
interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, 
along the common frontier between the United States and the Dominion of Canada, 
shall be referred from time to time to the International Joint Commission for 
examination and report, whenever either the Government of the United States or 
the Government of the Dominion of Canada shall request that such questions or 
matters of difference be so referred. 
<P>The International Joint Commission is authorized in each case so referred to 
examine into and report upon the facts and circumstances of the particular 
questions and matters referred, together with such conclusions and 
recommendations as may be appropriate, subject, however, to any restrictions or 
exceptions which may be imposed with respect thereto by the terms of the 
reference. 
<P>Such reports of the Commission shall not be regarded as decisions of the 
questions or matters so submitted either on the facts or the law, and shall in 
no way have the character of an arbitral award. 
<P>The Commission shall make a joint report to both Governments in all cases in 
which all or a majority of the Commissioners agree, and in case of disagreement 
the minority may make a joint report to both Governments, or separate reports to 
their respective Governments. 
<P>In case the Commission is evenly divided upon any question or matter referred 
to it for report, separate reports shall be made by the Commissioners on each 
side to their own Government. 
<P><B>ARTICLE X</B> 
<P>Any questions or matters of difference arising between the High Contracting 
Parties involving the rights, obligations, or interests of the United States or 
of the Dominion of Canada either in relation to each other or to their 
respective inhabitants, may be referred for decision to the International Joint 
Commission by the consent of the two Parties, it being understood that on the 
part of the United States any such action will be by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate, and on the part of His Majesty's Government with the 
consent of the Governor General in Council. In each case so referred, the said 
Commission is authorized to examine into and report upon the facts and 
circumstances of the particular questions any matters referred, together with 
such conclusions and recommendations as may be appropriate, subject, however, to 
any restrictions or exceptions which may be imposed with respect thereto by the 
terms of the reference. 
<P>A majority of the said Commission shall have power to render a decision or 
finding upon any of the questions or matters so referred. 
<P>If the said Commission is equally divided or otherwise unable to render a 
decision or finding as to any questions or matters so referred, it shall be the 
duty of the Commissioners to make a joint report to both Governments, or 
separate reports to their respective Governments, showing the different 
conclusions arrived at with regard to the matters or questions referred, which 
questions or matters shall thereupon be referred for decision by the High 
Contracting Parties to an umpire chosen in accordance with the procedure 
prescribed in the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of Article XLV of the Hague 
Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes, dated October 
18, 1907. Such umpire shall have power to render a final decision with respect 
to those matters and questions so referred on which the Commission fail to 
agree. 
<P><B>ARTICLE XI</B> 
<P>A duplicate original of all decisions rendered and joint reports made by the 
Commission shall be transmitted to and filed with the Secretary of State of the 
United States and the Governor General of the Dominion of Canada, and to them 
shall be addressed all communications of the Commission. 
<P><B>ARTICLE XII</B> 
<P>The International Joint Commission shall meet and organize at Washington 
promptly after the members thereof are appointed, and when organized the 
Commission may fix such times and places for its meetings as may be necessary, 
subject at all times to special call or direction by the two Governments. Each 
Commissioner upon the first joint meeting of the Commission after his 
appointment, shall, before proceeding with the work of the Commission, make and 
subscribe a solemn declaration in writing that he will faithfully and 
impartially perform the duties imposed upon him under this treaty, and such 
declaration shall be entered on the records of the proceedings of the 
Commission. 
<P>The United States and Canadian sections of the Commission may each appoint a 
secretary, and these shall act as joint secretaries of the Commission at its 
joint sessions, and the Commission may employ engineers and clerical assistants 
from time to time as it may deem advisable. The salaries and personal expenses 
of the Commission and of the secretaries shall be paid by their respective 
Governments, and all reasonable and necessary joint expenses of the Commission, 
incurred by it, shall be paid in equal moieties by the High Contracting Parties. 

<P>The Commission shall have power to administer oaths to witnesses, and to take 
evidence on oath whenever deemed necessary in any proceeding, or inquiry, or 
matter within its jurisdiction under this treaty, and all parties interested 
therein shall be given convenient opportunity to be heard, and the High 
Contracting Parties agree to adopt such legislation as may be appropriate and 
necessary to give the Commission the powers above mentioned on each side of the 
boundary, and to provide for the issue of subpoenas and for compelling the 
attendance of witnesses in proceedings before the Commission before the 
Commission. The Commission may adopt such rules of procedure as shall be in 
accordance with justice and equity, and may make such examination in person and 
through agents or employees as may be deemed advisable. 
<P><B>ARTICLE XIII</B> 
<P>In all cases where special agreements between the High Contracting Parties 
hereto are referred to in the foregoing articles, such agreements are understood 
and intended to include not only direct agreements between the High Contracting 
Parties, but also any mutual arrangement between the United States and the 
Dominion of Canada expressed by concurrent or reciprocal legislation on the part 
of Congress and the Parliament of the Dominion. 
<P><B>ARTICLE XIV</B> 
<P>The present treaty shall be ratified by the President of the United States of 
America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, thereof, and by His 
Britannic Majesty. The ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington as soon as 
possible and the treaty shall take effect on the date of the exchange of its 
ratifications. It shall remain in force for five years, dating from the day of 
exchange of ratifications, and thereafter until terminated by twelve months' 
written notice given by either High Contracting Party to the other.
