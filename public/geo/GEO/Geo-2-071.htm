<P><EM>[B]y tomorrow morning we shall almost certainly have one less species on 
Planet Earth than we had this morning. It will not be a charismatic creature 
like the tiger. It could well be an obscure insect in the depths of some remote 
rainforest. It may even be a creature that nobody has ever heard of. But it will 
be gone. A unique form of life will have been driven from the face of the earth 
forever.</EM><A href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_2_">

<P>
<H4>
<CENTER>I. Introduction</H4></CENTER>
<P>The problem of wildlife endangerment and extinction is a concern of global 
proportion. Every country in the world must now face the fact that there are 
species being depleted forever and the ramifications of extinction have an 
everlasting effect. The rate of species endangerment and/or extinction is 
staggering. The United States Department of Interior estimated that 300 species 
face extinction each decade. Other estimates place the figure as high as several 
species disappearing every day.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> 
<P>Legal and illegal trade in wildlife are both to blame, and the reasons for 
culpability are diverse. This Article will discuss the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES)<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and its 
attempt to address the dire problems of legal and illegal trade, as well as 
regulating and monitoring the wildlife trade. First, this Article will address 
the importance of wildlife preservation and illegal wildlife trade. Second, it 
will discuss the general provisions, as well as major loopholes, in the CITES 
treaty, and describe the problems of enforcing its provisions. Serious obstacles 
facing effective wildlife regulation and preservation include the differing 
social, economic, and religious beliefs of the various member countries, which 
have a direct impact on each country's willingness to preserve and protect 
species. 
<P>Further, this Article will examine the enforcement of wildlife laws in the 
United States through the provisions of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the 
Lacey Act, and the CITES treaty. Each of these laws addresses species 
endangerment in the international arena as it affects importation into the 
United States. Lastly, this Article will discuss areas in which enforcement and 
regulation can be improved to ensure that wildlife is given the full protection 
it well deserves on this planet. 
<P>
<H4>
<CENTER>II. The Importance of Species Preservation</H4></CENTER>
<P>There are several reasons why wildlife protection is such an important issue, 
and why it is imperative upon <EM>every</EM> country to ensure that trade is 
enforced and regulated. Species diminution has several adverse consequences. 
Utilitarian benefits that can be derived from flora and fauna species, both 
currently known and potentially discoverable, are lost irretrievably when a 
specie is rendered extinct by over-exploitation.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> If 
preserved, rare species of animals and plants may help to address the world's 
food crisis.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> For 
example, scientists have discovered that <EM>Zea diploperennis</EM>, a rare 
Mexican tall grass, may be crossed with corn through genetic engineering to 
create a perennial, virus-resistant hybrid which could substantially increase 
the world's food supply in the future.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> In 
addition, genetic experiments with plant species may contribute significantly 
toward helping countries increase their food supply. One experiment genetically 
crossing commercial tomatoes with a rare wild tomato from the Galapagos Islands 
has yielded a hybrid that can be irrigated with seventy percent sea water, 
helping to alleviate pressures on irrigation systems in developing countries.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> This 
tomato may be seen as an agricultural miracle in countries where water shortages 
have been a major obstacle to increasing food productivity. 
<P>Another benefit of species preservation involves the creation of vital 
medicines from plant and marine species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> 
Important medical advances have been made by using extracts from marine species 
in pharmaceuticals to combat cancer,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> and by 
using marine sponges in developing antibiotics.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> Flora 
and fauna species have also been used in heart drugs, analgesics, 
anticoagulants, and hormones.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> 
<P>These are only a few examples of the benefits that may be derived from flora 
and fauna species. There are innumerable other drugs and cures that could be 
discovered, although with the rate of extinction progressing at an accelerated 
rate, many of these benefits to humankind may never be realized. Moreover, 
despite these enormous benefits, less than one percent of the earth's plant 
species have been thoroughly studied for their possible usefulness to humans.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> 
<P>CITES attempts to address this situation. At the November 1994 meeting of 
CITES in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, member nations agreed to monitor and regulate 
the trade of the Himalayan Yew tree, a natural source of taxol medicine used to 
combat ovarian and breast cancer.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> 
Through its conferences, CITES seeks to initiate recognition of the importance 
of various types of species with the potential to cure disastrous diseases. 
<P>The seriousness of species extinction may be summed up in an observation by 
several members of the National Academy of Sciences, who view the ramifications 
of a loss of biodiversity "as second only in severity to the consequences of 
large scale nuclear warfare."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<H4>
<CENTER>III. Illegal Wildlife Trade and Dwindling Animal Populations Individual 
Countries</H4></CENTER>
<P>The declared annual legal wildlife trade at the importing stage is at least 
five billion dollars.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> Legal 
trade into and out of the United States alone is valued at approximately one 
billion dollars,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> 
however an illegal trade estimate is an incalculable figure. International 
illegal wildlife trade is a crucial concern worldwide. It is one of the primary 
contributing factors to the decline of wildlife species in recent years.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> The 
Interpol list of illegal trade activities reports that the monetary value 
generated from the illegal trade of endangered species is second only to drug 
smuggling.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> The 
real predator of endangered species is organized crime, which has added illegal 
wildlife trade to its resume of illicit activities.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> 
<P>Illegal trade has initiated an expanding black market for tiger bones and 
skins, bear gall bladders from Russia, rhino horns, elephant meat and ivory from 
Africa, and whale meat from Japan.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> The 
skins, hides and various organs or articles manufactured from these species 
command high prices in many parts of the world.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> As a 
result, the numbers for these animal populations are dwindling severely. In 
India, where 60% of the world's remaining tiger population resides, numbers have 
decreased from 4,334 to 3,750 in four years.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_23_"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A> A 
tiger is considered a very valuable asset in certain regions, such as Asia. 
Village poachers can expect to make ten years worth of income from a single 
tiger.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> One 
reason for their value is the extensive use of tiger parts in many Asian 
medicines.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_25_"><SUP>(25)</SUP></A> At the 
CITES Conference in November 1994, China, India, and other countries with a 
tiger population have signed an agreement to ban the trade of tiger parts and to 
preserve the tigers' habitat.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A> Other 
animal parts can generate substantial profit. A rhino horn, for example, can be 
worth up to a half a million dollars.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_27_"><SUP>(27)</SUP></A> It is 
no surprise that 90% of the world's rhino population has disappeared.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_28_"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A> 
<P>Wildlife trade violations in individual countries are rampant. For example, 
scientific research has revealed that Japan, a CITES member, has engaged in 
egregious violations of international wildlife laws regarding whale meat.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_29_"><SUP>(29)</SUP></A> 
Certain species of whale meat, such as the relatively abundant southern minke 
whale, are permitted to be sold in markets.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> 
Scientists, using a portable DNA sampling device and a laboratory set up in a 
hotel room in Japan, discovered that several samples of whale meat bought at 
several Japanese fish markets and grocery stores were in fact from endangered 
species of whales.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A> 
Scientists sampled sixteen pieces of whale meat and found that only seven were 
from minke whales, while the remainder were pieces of humpback whales, fin 
whales, dolphins, and a type of a beaked whale about the size of a killer 
whale.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_32_"><SUP>(32)</SUP></A> None 
of the packages of meat revealed the exact nature of their content, beyond 
calling it whale meat.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_33_"><SUP>(33)</SUP></A> It 
was, therefore, impossible to know if any of the salespeople at the markets 
where the samples were bought were aware that they were trading in illegal 
goods. The whale meat may have been imported illegally from other countries that 
continue to hunt whales, like Norway (a CITES member), or it may have been 
illegally caught by coastal fishermen.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_34_"><SUP>(34)</SUP></A> "It's 
like the drug-smuggling trade or anything else illicit," said Don White, a 
founder of Earthtrust, an organization that documents the practice of illegal 
driftnet fishing.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_35_"><SUP>(35)</SUP></A> 
"There's a lot of money to be had here."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_36_"><SUP>(36)</SUP></A> 
Indeed, in Japan, whale meat is like caviar, selling for about $300 per pound.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_37_"><SUP>(37)</SUP></A> 
Therefore, there is a profitable incentive to obtain whale meat from anywhere 
possible.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_38_"><SUP>(38)</SUP></A>

<CENTER>IV. Cites: Attempts to Address Regulation and Preservation at the 
International Level</H4></CENTER>
<P>
<P align=center><EM>A. Background and General Provisions of CITES</EM> 
<P>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and 
Fauna (CITES) was signed by the United States on March 3, 1973<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_39_"><SUP>(39)</SUP></A> in an 
effort to address the ever increasing problem of species endangerment at the 
international level. In 1975, when the Convention came into force,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_40_"><SUP>(40)</SUP></A> ten 
countries were member states.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_41_"><SUP>(41)</SUP></A> There 
are now 118 members to this international treaty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_42_"><SUP>(42)</SUP></A> 
<P>CITES has been characterized as perhaps the most successful of all 
international treaties concerned with the conservation of wildlife.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_43_"><SUP>(43)</SUP></A> The 
concept of CITES is simple but the complexities of human nature and the laws of 
economics make implementation more difficult.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_44_"><SUP>(44)</SUP></A> The 
goal of the treaty is to control, reduce and/or eliminate the international 
trade in those species whose numbers or conditions suggest that further removal 
of individuals from their natural habitat would be detrimental to the specie's 
survival.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_45_"><SUP>(45)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Preamble to CITES recognizes that "wild flora and fauna in their many 
beautiful forms are an irreplaceable part of the natural systems of the earth 
which must be protected for this and the generations to come . . . ."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_46_"><SUP>(46)</SUP></A> The 
Preamble also states that wildlife is valuable "from aesthetic, scientific, 
cultural, recreational, and economic points of view."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_47_"><SUP>(47)</SUP></A> CITES 
provides for detailed regulations concerning international legal trade among 
member countries. The extent of the intricate requirements are beyond the scope 
of this Article, as the treaty is a lengthy and complex document, demonstrating 
the fact that however simple the concept may be, monitoring and preserving 
wildlife is a difficult undertaking. 
<P>The CITES treaty covers approximately 3,000 animal and 35,000 plant species<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_48_"><SUP>(48)</SUP></A> and 
divides them into three appendices based on their vulnerability to extinction.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_49_"><SUP>(49)</SUP></A> 
Appendix I species are the most vulnerable and include all species threatened 
with extinction which are or which may be affected by trade.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_50_"><SUP>(50)</SUP></A> 
Because Appendix I species are under the threat of extinction, they receive the 
highest degree of protection.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_51_"><SUP>(51)</SUP></A> As an 
added measure of protection, trade is defined very broadly in CITES<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_52_"><SUP>(52)</SUP></A> to 
mean export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_53_"><SUP>(53)</SUP></A> Thus, 
any time that a specimen of a protected species crosses national borders, the 
action is considered trade and will have to satisfy the provisions of the 
treaty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_54_"><SUP>(54)</SUP></A> 
<P>For most Appendix I species, the treaty requires two documents for trade: an 
export and an import permit, each to be obtained from a different country.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_55_"><SUP>(55)</SUP></A> The 
requirement of an export and import document for Appendix I species is of 
primary importance in trade under CITES. In order for both documents to be 
issued, the Scientific Authority of the exporting country must determine that 
the export will "not (be) detrimental to the survival of the species,"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_56_"><SUP>(56)</SUP></A> and 
that the living specimen will be shipped to "minimize the risk of injury, damage 
to health or cruel treatment."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_57_"><SUP>(57)</SUP></A> In 
addition, the exporting country must determine that the trade is not illegal.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_58_"><SUP>(58)</SUP></A> 
<P>CITES' requirement of two permits is also an important factor that hampers 
corruption attempts by traders, as corrupting two governments is more difficult 
and expensive for the illegal wildlife trader than corrupting one government.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_59_"><SUP>(59)</SUP></A> 
Endangered species trade can be financially rewarding not only for the traders, 
but also the producers of forged documents, and for government officials who are 
susceptible to bribes.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_60_"><SUP>(60)</SUP></A> 
Requiring two permits, therefore, will make corrupting governments for the 
purpose of illegal wildlife trade a more arduous endeavor. For an import permit 
to be issued, the Scientific Authority of the importing state must determine 
that the "import will be for purposes which are not detrimental to the survival 
of the species,"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_61_"><SUP>(61)</SUP></A> that 
"the proposed recipient of a living specimen is suitably equipped to house and 
care for it,"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_62_"><SUP>(62)</SUP></A> and a 
Management Authority of the importing state "is satisfied that the specimen is 
not to be used for primarily commercial purposes."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_63_"><SUP>(63)</SUP></A> 
<P>"Commercial purpose" is the critical difference between an Appendix I and 
Appendix II or III species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_64_"><SUP>(64)</SUP></A> CITES 
allows commercial trade of Appendix II and III species in certain circumstances. 
Because Appendix I species are vulnerable to extinction, trade in Appendix I 
species between CITES signatories for commercial purposes is strictly 
prohibited.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_65_"><SUP>(65)</SUP></A> 
Commercial trade is not defined in the treaty, although it may be reasonably 
defined as the "acts of purchase and resale for profit."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_66_"><SUP>(66)</SUP></A> Import 
for retail or wholesale transactions is prohibited, however the transfer of 
money is not the distinguishing factor. At the 1985 Conference in Buenos Aires, 
the delegates adopted Conference 5.10, in an attempt to more clearly define 
"commercial purpose."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_67_"><SUP>(67)</SUP></A> First, 
trade in Appendix I species should be authorized only in exceptional 
circumstances, and second, if the species are traded, a commercial purpose 
should be defined as broadly as possible.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_68_"><SUP>(68)</SUP></A> The 
burden of proof is on the importer to prove the non-commercial aspects of the 
import, and those aspects should clearly eclipse any other purpose for the 
trade.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_69_"><SUP>(69)</SUP></A> The 
focus of the import should be on the use of the species in the importing 
country.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_70_"><SUP>(70)</SUP></A> 
Finally, the term "commercial" is defined as obtaining an economic benefit by 
sale, exchange, or use.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_71_"><SUP>(71)</SUP></A> 
<P>Species listed in Appendix II may be traded for commercial purposes, but an 
export permit must be obtained.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_72_"><SUP>(72)</SUP></A> An 
export permit may only be issued if the Scientific Authority of the exporting 
state finds that the trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the 
species, that the trade is not illegal, and that the species is transported to 
minimize risk of injury, health or cruel treatment.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_73_"><SUP>(73)</SUP></A> 
<P>Appendix III requires an export permit if the organisms are being exported 
from the country responsible for listing the particular species in Appendix 
III.<A href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_74_"><SUP>(74)</SUP></A> 
An export permit is to be granted only if the Management Authority of the 
exporting state finds that the specimen was not obtained illegally and is 
shipped so as to avoid injury and cruel treatment.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_75_"><SUP>(75)</SUP></A> The 
listing of species in Appendix III can be done unilaterally by one party at any 
time it may wish. As a result, the export permit requirement applies only to the 
country which has requested the Appendix III listing.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_76_"><SUP>(76)</SUP></A> 
<P align=center><EM>B. Loopholes in CITES and the Problem of Enforcement</EM> 
<P>In complex international agreements, such as CITES, there will inevitably be 
provisions that are ambiguous or that may be construed differently by various 
countries. Interpretation of the treaty's provisions by CITES members can be as 
diverse as the member nations themselves. The problem of interpretation is one 
which is not easily resolved. Moreover, member states may encourage provisions 
to be drafted ambiguously, which allows the individual country to evade certain 
provisions of the treaty. 
<P>For instance, Article I of the treaty defines a "specimen" as "any animal or 
plant . . . [or] any recognizable part or derivative thereof. . . ."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_77_"><SUP>(77)</SUP></A> Thus, 
only if a plant or animal specimen is readily recognizable is it within the 
control of CITES.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_78_"><SUP>(78)</SUP></A> The 
term "readily recognizable" is not defined elsewhere in CITES, and thus creates 
a potential loophole.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_79_"><SUP>(79)</SUP></A> 
According to one author, there are two policy reasons why "readily recognizable" 
is not defined. First, member states may not have wanted to assume a much more 
detailed documentation and inspection process that would otherwise be 
required.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_80_"><SUP>(80)</SUP></A> 
Second, some member states did not want to interfere unnecessarily with their 
international trade of retail goods and thus maintained the loophole.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_81_"><SUP>(81)</SUP></A> An 
identification manual has been developed by members of CITES in an attempt to 
identify every species listed, but keeping it current is another problem.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_82_"><SUP>(82)</SUP></A> 
Another large loophole is found in Article VII, "Exemptions and Other Special 
Provisions Relating to Trade." Specimens may be imported or exported if they are 
"personal or household effects"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_83_"><SUP>(83)</SUP></A> which 
is not defined anywhere in the treaty. This provision may be interpreted, for 
example, as allowing individual purchases for "personal need" items, or private 
persons' "clothing or jewelry."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_84_"><SUP>(84)</SUP></A> The 
buyer only need claim that the item was purchased in his home state,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_85_"><SUP>(85)</SUP></A> or 
that it was bought before CITES came into effect.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_86_"><SUP>(86)</SUP></A> As 
long as individuals such as tourists continue to purchase such items made from 
illegally-killed animals, the poaching of protected species will continue.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_87_"><SUP>(87)</SUP></A> 
<P>One major way to evade the CITES treaty regulations is found in Article X, 
"Trade With States Not Party to This Convention." The language in this provision 
is vague: trade between members and non-members is allowed only if there is 
comparable documentation issued by competent authorities which substantially 
conforms with the requirement of CITES.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_88_"><SUP>(88)</SUP></A> 
Approximately 30% of wildlife trade occurs with non-parties.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_89_"><SUP>(89)</SUP></A> As a 
result, many countries may become "laundering" ports for illegal wildlife 
trade.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_90_"><SUP>(90)</SUP></A> If 
CITES was truly interested in enforcement of illegal trade violations, it would 
curtail trading with non-member states. Trade with non-members could be 
regulated more strictly by defining how member countries trading with 
non-members must adhere to the requirements of CITES, and exactly what those 
requirements are. This section is so vague it is easy to see how countries may 
circumscribe the treaty altogether by trading with non-members. Even if the 
member country is caught violating this provision, it is very difficult to see 
how this ambiguous section will be enforced against the violating country. 
<P>Article VII constitutes another loophole in that when a party becomes a 
member of CITES, or when a new species is listed, there is a "grace period" 
which allows countries to import or export species without regulation.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_91_"><SUP>(91)</SUP></A> In 
effect, this allows the country to stockpile specimens in anticipation of the 
new regulations.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_92_"><SUP>(92)</SUP></A> When 
the United Kingdom was not a party to CITES, it imported approximately 27,000 
ocelot skins per year.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_93_"><SUP>(93)</SUP></A> The 
year the United Kingdom announced its intention to ratify CITES, it imported 
50,000 ocelot skins.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_94_"><SUP>(94)</SUP></A> The 
practice of stockpiling can have extremely adverse effects, and in some cases 
may have more of an adverse effect than a steady killing of a species, as a 
sudden increase in the killing can swiftly exterminate the whole species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_95_"><SUP>(95)</SUP></A> CITES 
is aware of this issue, and at the Convention in November 1994, the parties 
attempted to regulate the issue of stockpiling.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_96_"><SUP>(96)</SUP></A> 
<P>CITES' major defect is that there is no treaty-wide, nor worldwide 
enforcement.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_97_"><SUP>(97)</SUP></A> 
Article VIII, "Measures to be Taken by the Parties" contains a general 
enforcement provision, however, it is relatively innocuous. Any means of 
enforcement is left up to the discretion of the member states.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_98_"><SUP>(98)</SUP></A> As a 
result, there is little deterrence for wildlife poachers and smugglers. The 
effectiveness of CITES' enforcement was evaluated in one experiment conducted in 
1979 by TRAFFIC, an organization funded by the World Wildlife Fund that monitors 
trade in endangered species and other flora and fauna.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_99_"><SUP>(99)</SUP></A> The 
group transported a cactus, which is listed in at least one of the appendices of 
CITES, and openly declared it at customs of ten countries.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_100_"><SUP>(100)</SUP></A> The 
TRAFFIC member carrying the cactus was never questioned; the United States and 
the Russian Federation confiscated it, but only for health reasons.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_101_"><SUP>(101)</SUP></A> In 
another blatant enforcement oversight, an importing country was presented with a 
shipment of penguins, which are listed in Appendix I and II, and the export 
document listed the country of origin as Paraguay.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_102_"><SUP>(102)</SUP></A> 
Although common knowledge dictates that penguins do not inhabit Paraguay, the 
country allowed the shipment without question.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_103_"><SUP>(103)</SUP></A> 
These are a few of the conspicuous violations that better enforcement mechanisms 
would cure. 
<P>Article XXIII is yet another provision that may be considered an escape 
clause. This Article allows a state in effect, to evade the treaty by entering a 
"reservation," concerning certain species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_104_"><SUP>(104)</SUP></A> A 
reservation is a mechanism exercised unilaterally by a state to opt out of a 
portion of a treaty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_105_"><SUP>(105)</SUP></A> 
Under CITES, a member can enter specific reservations as to listed species or 
any parts or derivatives of an Appendix III species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_106_"><SUP>(106)</SUP></A> The 
practical impact of entering a reservation is that it allows the state to trade 
with non-members without the CITES trade restrictions.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_107_"><SUP>(107)</SUP></A> 
Moreover, importing and exporting is governed by Article X,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_108_"><SUP>(108)</SUP></A> in 
which trade requirements are ambiguous and open to interpretation. Currently the 
United States has no reservations under CITES, and the European Community's 
coordinating regulation does not allow for reservations. Other countries, such 
as Japan, maintain significant reservations<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_109_"><SUP>(109)</SUP></A> for 
six whales and seven reptiles,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_110_"><SUP>(110)</SUP></A> and 
African nations retain a reservation to limit compliance with the ban on the 
elephant trade<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_111_"><SUP>(111)</SUP></A> 
despite the fact that elephant numbers are rapidly declining. One frightening 
estimate suggests that while as many as 1.3 million elephants might have existed 
in 1979, fewer than 750,000 were counted in 1987.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_112_"><SUP>(112)</SUP></A> 
CITES is the key international focal point for the regulation of the ivory 
trade.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_113_"><SUP>(113)</SUP></A> 
Unfortunately, if countries are allowed to enter reservations for certain 
species, CITES' effectiveness regulating trade with that species is drastically 
attenuated. 
<P>Despite many weaknesses, the CITES treaty should not be criticized too 
extensively when considering the magnitude of the task of regulating 
international wildlife trade. CITES is represented by 118 Party States across 
the world,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_114_"><SUP>(114)</SUP></A> each 
of which has its own legal, political, economic and bureaucratic issues with 
which to contend.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_115_"><SUP>(115)</SUP></A> Many 
of the countries have extensive economic problems, where the majority population 
is impoverished. If the hide of an endangered species can feed a poor family for 
a year, it is difficult to imagine how a treaty would deter a family from 
hunting the animal and using the hide for survival. One solution may be to 
educate indigenous peoples on the importance of biodiversity and on various 
methods of improving species populations. In addition, poorer countries might 
benefit by encouraging tourists to view endangered species in their natural 
habitats, which would generate income without killing the animals indigenous to 
the area.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_116_"><SUP>(116)</SUP></A> 
<P>Since CITES includes no specific provisions for enforcing its requirements 
against individual violators or signatory nations,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_117_"><SUP>(117)</SUP></A> 
enforcement primarily lies with its members.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_118_"><SUP>(118)</SUP></A> Each 
member administers the requirements of CITES through its own legal system, which 
is necessary from a standpoint of state sovereignty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_119_"><SUP>(119)</SUP></A> In 
reality, each state may administer CITES and enforce violations in its 
discretion. As a result, the goals of wildlife regulation and preservation may 
be compromised as a result of a lack of uniform enforcement. Individual defiance 
may have disastrous results. This year, three countries, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and 
Malawi threatened to disregard CITES regulations altogether.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_120_"><SUP>(120)</SUP></A> In 
addition, one of the greatest obstacles to CITES is greed and corruption within 
the Party State, as government officials are themselves involved in the poaching 
of animals, illegal issuance of permits, and forged documents, to name a few 
illicit activities.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_121_"><SUP>(121)</SUP></A> If 
the CITES resolutions are to have any force whatsoever, enforcement measures 
will have to be leveled at village hunters and organized crime that establish 
the markets for these species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_122_"><SUP>(122)</SUP></A> 
Effective enforcement of international wildlife laws require resources to combat 
organized crime at all levels.<A

<CENTER>V. Enforcement of Wildlife Violations in the United States</H4></CENTER>
<P>
<P>There are several United States legislative enactments which may fortify the 
CITES treaty and provide enforcement and cooperation mechanisms. These acts also 
provide for the prosecution of wildlife violators in areas where the CITES 
treaty standing alone may be lacking. The Endangered Species Act of 1973<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_124_"><SUP>(124)</SUP></A> 
(ESA) prohibits trade in violation of CITES, and empowers the United States Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) with enforcement of CITES' requirements.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_125_"><SUP>(125)</SUP></A> In 
addition, section 8 of the ESA gives the President of the United States the 
power to provide financial assistance to foreign nations for species 
conservation programs, to direct the Secretary of the Interior to encourage 
foreign governments to protect rare species, and to foster agreements between 
the United States and other countries on species preservation.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_126_"><SUP>(126)</SUP></A> 
Further, section 8 allows the Secretary of the Interior, after consulting with 
the Secretary of State, to offer the services of federal personnel to foreign 
nations or to international organizations attempting to conserve fish, wildlife, 
or plants.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_127_"><SUP>(127)</SUP></A> The 
United States may also provide or finance training of foreign wildlife 
experts.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_128_"><SUP>(128)</SUP></A> 
Additionally, law enforcement investigations and research may be conducted at 
the request of the Secretary of the Interior.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_129_"><SUP>(129)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Lacey Act<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_130_"><SUP>(130)</SUP></A> 
prohibits wildlife trade in violation of any state, federal, or foreign law<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_131_"><SUP>(131)</SUP></A> or 
any treaty signed by the United States.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_132_"><SUP>(132)</SUP></A> 
United States courts are increasingly using the Lacey Act as a means of finding 
liability for wildlife violations. Federal customs laws have also been used to 
prosecute illegal wildlife traders.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_133_"><SUP>(133)</SUP></A> 
<P align=center><EM>A. Penalties under the ESA and the Lacey Act: Vehicles for 
Enforcement of Wildlife Laws</EM> 
<P align=center>1. Civil Penalties 
<P>The civil penalty of forfeiture<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_134_"><SUP>(134)</SUP></A> 
under both the ESA and the Lacey Act is used extensively, partly because the 
government does not bear a burden of proof at trial.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_135_"><SUP>(135)</SUP></A> The 
penalty will be imposed on the defendant if the government demonstrates probable 
cause that the wildlife is illegal, or contraband.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_136_"><SUP>(136)</SUP></A> The 
burden then shifts to the claimant to prove that the wildlife is legal.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_137_"><SUP>(137)</SUP></A> 
Under the Lacey Act a defendant may pay a civil penalty of $10,000 for a 
negligent violation of wildlife trade.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_138_"><SUP>(138)</SUP></A> 
<P align=center>2. Criminal Penalties 
<P>The Lacey Act classifies criminal violations into felonies and misdemeanors. 
A felony may include a $20,000 fine and imprisonment for up to five years, 
however proof of a higher standard of scienter by the defendant is required.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_139_"><SUP>(139)</SUP></A> 
These penalties are reserved for persons who violate the Act knowingly.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_140_"><SUP>(140)</SUP></A> For 
misdemeanor violations, a "due care" requirement is imposed.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_141_"><SUP>(141)</SUP></A> If 
the individual should have known, in the exercise of due care, that the specimen 
was taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of another law, they may 
be fined $10,000, and/or imprisoned for one year.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_142_"><SUP>(142)</SUP></A> 
Under the ESA, a strict liability civil fine may be imposed of up to $10,000 per 
violation for a wildlife dealer and $500 for other persons.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_143_"><SUP>(143)</SUP></A> 
<P align=center><EM>B. Judicial Enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, 
CITES, and the Lacey Act</EM> 
<P>Several United States cases demonstrate how courts interpret wildlife acts. 
In two landmark cases, the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida found liability under the ESA, CITES, and the Lacey Act.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_144_"><SUP>(144)</SUP></A> 
<EM>U.S. v. 3,210 Crusted Sides of Caiman Crocodilus</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_145_"><SUP>(145)</SUP></A> and 
<EM>U.S. v. 2,507 Live Canary Winged Parakeets</EM><A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_146_"><SUP>(146)</SUP></A> led 
the way to a nationwide increase in the use of the Lacey Act by the courts, and 
to a lesser degree the ESA, in wildlife trade violations cases.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_147_"><SUP>(147)</SUP></A> 
These two cases have been cited in almost every later case involving forfeiture 
under the Lacey Act or the ESA.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_148_"><SUP>(148)</SUP></A> Both 
cases interpreted South American law and forfeiture procedures.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_149_"><SUP>(149)</SUP></A> 
<P>In <EM>Crocodilus</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_150_"><SUP>(150)</SUP></A> a 
flight from Bolivia to Paris carrying crocodile hides made an unscheduled stop 
in Miami, Florida.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_151_"><SUP>(151)</SUP></A> A 
Fish and Wildlife Service officer in Miami inspected the hides and found the 
country of origin listed on the export license to be suspicious, since the 
species listed were not native to Bolivia.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_152_"><SUP>(152)</SUP></A> At 
trial, the court found that the hides were actually from an endangered species, 
and not from the species that were noted in the documentation.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_153_"><SUP>(153)</SUP></A> In 
addition, the court found that the stop in Miami constituted importation under 
United States customs law.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_154_"><SUP>(154)</SUP></A> The 
court therefore found probable cause to believe that CITES, the ESA and the 
Lacey Act had all been violated.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_155_"><SUP>(155)</SUP></A> The 
court found that the hides were subject to forfeiture under the ESA,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_156_"><SUP>(156)</SUP></A> and 
that the hides had been imported in violation of CITES, because the permit was 
not an original,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_157_"><SUP>(157)</SUP></A> as 
mandated, and the permit stated that the number of hides was 3,210, when the 
actual number was 10,875.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_158_"><SUP>(158)</SUP></A> 
Under the Lacey Act the court found probable cause to believe that a Bolivian 
law prohibiting the hunting of the undersized crocodile had been violated.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_159_"><SUP>(159)</SUP></A> The 
court rejected the defendant's contention that he was an "innocent owner,"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_160_"><SUP>(160)</SUP></A> and 
the entire shipment of hides was forfeited.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_161_"><SUP>(161)</SUP></A> The 
court stated that the entire <EM>res</EM> of the hides was subject to 
forfeiture, and not just the number of hides which exceeded the amount declared 
in the CITES permit.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_162_"><SUP>(162)</SUP></A> The 
court explained that 
<P>the purpose of CITES (and the ESA) is to prevent extinction of certain 
species by 'over-exploitation through international trade'. . . . To accomplish 
this aim, the penalties for CITES must be stringent. Merely forfeiting the 
offending portion of the res would only serve to thwart the intent and undermine 
the effectiveness of both CITES and the (ESA). . . . The plain intent of 
Congress in enacting [the ESA] wasto halt and reverse the trend toward species 
extinction, whatever the cost.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_163_"><SUP>(163)</SUP></A>This 
case is remarkable for having explored foreign law and an international 
convention, and as a result paved the way for future courts to implement these 
provisions of wildlife enforcement.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_164_"><SUP>(164)</SUP></A> In 
addition, the court applied the provisions of the ESA and CITES strictly, which 
demonstrates that United States courts are serious about wildlife trade 
violations. 
<P>In <EM>Parakeets</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_165_"><SUP>(165)</SUP></A> a 
bird importer had a CITES permit signed by the Peruvian Director of the 
Department of Forest and Fauna.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_166_"><SUP>(166)</SUP></A> 
Because Peruvian law prohibited the exportation of native live wild animals, and 
the species imported fell into that category, the court found that the Director 
had no authority to sign the permit.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_167_"><SUP>(167)</SUP></A> The 
permit was therefore held invalid because it was obtained in violation of 
Peruvian law, and the importer was found to have violated the ESA, CITES, and 
the Lacey Act.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_168_"><SUP>(168)</SUP></A> The 
court also rejected the innocent owner defense, holding that even if the 
importer genuinely believed that the permit was valid, he nevertheless had an 
affirmative duty to inquire into the legality of the shipment.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_169_"><SUP>(169)</SUP></A> The 
court also imposed forfeiture as a penalty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_170_"><SUP>(170)</SUP></A> The 
court in <EM>Parakeets</EM> established more than precedent. Like the 
<EM>Crocodilus</EM> case, it set out a tough standard for wildlife traders and 
sent a message that violations will not be treated lightly. Both the 
<EM>Parakeets</EM> and <EM>Crocodilus</EM> cases provide a framework for the 
application of the principles set out in the ESA, CITES, and the Lacey Act in 
the enforcement of wildlife protection and trade violations in future cases. 
<P>Constitutional challenges to the incorporation of foreign law argued by 
defendants in ESA and Lacey Act cases have been rejected by the courts. 
Defendants have argued either that their due process rights have been violated 
due to the incorporation of foreign law, thereby allowing government officials 
unlimited discretion,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_171_"><SUP>(171)</SUP></A> or 
that the law has been unconstitutionally vague.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_172_"><SUP>(172)</SUP></A> In 
<EM>U.S. v. 594,464 Pounds of Salmon</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_173_"><SUP>(173)</SUP></A> 
United States officials alleged that the defendant had exported fish from Taiwan 
without a permit in violation of a Taiwanese regulation, and that the 
importation of the salmon into the United States was part of a complex 
international fish smuggling scheme.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_174_"><SUP>(174)</SUP></A> The 
Lacey Act provided for forfeiture of certain fish imported into the United 
States in violation of "any foreign law."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_175_"><SUP>(175)</SUP></A> The 
court found that the Taiwanese regulation requiring the permit was a "foreign 
law."<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_176_"><SUP>(176)</SUP></A> The 
defendant argued that the incorporation of foreign law violated his due process 
rights. The Ninth Circuit rejected the defendant's argument, reasoning that the 
Lacey Act only looks to foreign law to determine if the Act has been triggered. 
The Act, therefore does not incorporate foreign law nor does it allow unlimited 
discretion to government officials.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_177_"><SUP>(177)</SUP></A> 
<P>In addressing the defendant's argument that the Lacey Act was 
unconstitutionally vague, the court explained that the vagueness issue focused 
on the inquiry of whether the statute's terms are insufficiently clear. 
Specifically, the court had to decide whether the term "any foreign law" was 
sufficiently clear in providing the defendant with fair warning.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_178_"><SUP>(178)</SUP></A> The 
court found that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague, explaining that a 
statute providing for civil sanctions is reviewed for vagueness with greater 
tolerance than one involving criminal penalties.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_179_"><SUP>(179)</SUP></A> 
Further, the defendant, who was frequently involved in large international 
commercial transactions, should have been aware of a strong possibility that 
violation of a foreign regulation would trigger the forfeiture provision of the 
Act.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_180_"><SUP>(180)</SUP></A> 
<P>Determining whether a violation of CITES and the ESA has occurred is 
generally a straightforward procedure for courts.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_181_"><SUP>(181)</SUP></A> In 
<EM>U.S. v. 1,000 Raw Skins of Caiman Crocodilus Yacare</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_182_"><SUP>(182)</SUP></A> 
crocodile <EM>yacare</EM> skins were incorrectly listed on CITES documentation 
as <EM>crocodilus crocodilus</EM>, and the country of origin was erroneously 
labeled as Colombia.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_183_"><SUP>(183)</SUP></A> A 
CITES permit must state the correct scientific name of the species or specimen, 
and the correct country of origin, therefore any factual error is a violation of 
CITES and of the ESA.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_184_"><SUP>(184)</SUP></A> 
<P>Courts not only uphold the law against big game hunters, commercial 
fisherman, and commercial wildlife traders,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_185_"><SUP>(185)</SUP></A> but 
also against seemingly innocuous wildlife dealers such as zoos. In <EM>World 
Wildlife Fund v. Hodel</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_186_"><SUP>(186)</SUP></A> the 
non-profit Toledo Zoo had been granted a permit from the Fish and Wildlife 
Service (FWS) to import two giant pandas from China for a temporary 
exhibition.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_187_"><SUP>(187)</SUP></A> The 
Zoo was expected to profit from the exhibition through increased attendance and 
souvenir sales.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_188_"><SUP>(188)</SUP></A> 
Pandas are listed in Appendix I of CITES, in which trade is strictly 
regulated.<A

<P>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), an organization dedicated to preserving 
wildlife, sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the zoo from continuing the 
panda display because pandas are an endangered species.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_190_"><SUP>(190)</SUP></A> The 
court enjoined the zoo only from charging an extra fee to view the pandas based 
on a public policy consideration, because irreparable harm had not been proved 
by the plaintiffs.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_191_"><SUP>(191)</SUP></A> The 
case should be considered a victory for wildlife despite the court refusing to 
enjoin the zoo, since the court ultimately enforced the CITES provisions against 
a non-profit zoo that had taken measures to comply with the law in importing the 
pandas.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_192_"><SUP>(192)</SUP></A> One 
important result of this case is that the FWS revised its permit policy 
regarding pandas to incorporate the WWF's concerns, and China announced it would 
no longer loan giant pandas nor endangered golden monkeys to the United 
States.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_193_"><SUP>(193)</SUP></A> This 
case was another milestone for wildlife enforcement as the court administered 
the law very stringently, despite the importer's efforts to comply with CITES.<A

<P>In <EM>U.S. v. Asper</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_195_"><SUP>(195)</SUP></A> the 
court considered specific aspects of the ESA, CITES, and the Lacey Act in the 
commercial context. The defendant argued that the species he imported for his 
for-profit museum did not constitute use for a commercial purpose<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_196_"><SUP>(196)</SUP></A> 
because the venture operated at a loss.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_197_"><SUP>(197)</SUP></A> The 
court, however, found that a commercial purpose was involved, therefore the 
defendant was subject to a more severe penalty.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_198_"><SUP>(198)</SUP></A> The 
court alternatively held that the defendant deserved a harsher sentence because 
he had killed a large male <EM>Jentink's duiker</EM>,<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_199_"><SUP>(199)</SUP></A> of 
which only one to two hundred which existed at the time.<A

<EM>Asper</EM> is another example of a court strictly enforcing wildlife laws 
and imposing strict sentences. These cases should serve as a deterrent to 
illegal traders, and a reminder to legal traders that their actions will be 
scrutinized by the court as well.

<CENTER>V. Conclusion </H4></CENTER>
<P>Although hailed as "the most successful of all international wildlife 
treaties,"<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_201_"><SUP>(201)</SUP></A> 
CITES contains significant loopholes, and through its ambiguous provisions, 
allows many wildlife importers to escape liability or detection. CITES does not 
provide for an effective enforcement procedure against individual violators nor 
member countries who choose to look the other way when violations occur. Perhaps 
such is the nature of an international multi-member treaty, whose Party States 
encompass the four corners of the world. Politics, notions of state sovereignty, 
vast differences in economic development, individual ideas of what constitutes 
wildlife endangerment and social and religious beliefs in general are all 
considerations, and ultimately, obstacles to successful administration and 
enforcement of wildlife laws. 
<P>International pressure encourages adherence and continued participation, yet 
a lack of funds and insufficient infrastructure to manage or verify compliance 
are two major enforcement problems.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_202_"><SUP>(202)</SUP></A> 
Nevertheless, there is still hope when one considers that some communities are 
initiating their own wildlife regulations by banning hunting and trafficking, 
and conserving species populations. 
<P>Courts in the United States have taken the problem of species importation 
seriously by interpreting the Lacey Act, the ESA, and the CITES treaty to 
maximize the number of violators prosecuted. This manifests a willingness on 
behalf of the United States courts to use these laws whenever the FWS discovers 
a violation of CITES, the wildlife laws of the United States or of any foreign 
country. The broad interpretation of wildlife preservation laws can only help to 
ensure that wildlife remains protected. While United States courts may only 
prosecute wildlife offenders and importers with contraband within their 
jurisdiction, the United States' efforts at law enforcement and prosecution 
represent a significant enough portion of the world wildlife trade that may have 
a notable effect on the entire illegal species industry.<A 
href="http://www.nesl.edu/annual/vol3/cite.htm#N_203_"><SUP>(203)</SUP></A> 
Continued enforcement by the United States of these wildlife laws can at least 
serve as a deterrent to poachers and illicit traders from finding a market in 
the United States in which to peddle endangered and threatened wildlife. One can 
only anticipate that other countries will follow suit before many other 
endangered species disappear forever.

three levels of endangered species covered by the CITES treaty are: 
<P>Appendix I: Species are strictly regulated. Participating countries agree to 
ban all commercial trade. This category consists of: (1) live animals or plants; 
(2) parts of animals or plants. 
<P>Appendix II: Trade is less restricted, but trade of goods is regulated. 
<P>Appendix III: Regulations in this category do not require joint approval by 
CITES members. Regulations may be enacted by an individual country by refusing 
to issue or accept import or export permits for a certain species. Wesley,

<P><A name=N_118_>118. </A>In Northern Areas, Pakistan, villagers wanted to stop 
the illegal hunting of game, including snow leopards and Himalayan black bears. 
While the Pakistani government has many regulations to protect wild species, 
enforcement is virtually impossible. The villages requested assistance in 
developing programs to manage their wildlife, and several actually took the 
initiative to stop all hunting in their areas, including hunting by hunters in 
their villages. In one case, a village sent a delegation to the local radio 
station, several kilometers away, to announce their hunting ban and the 
penalties if hunters were caught, including a fine of 5,000 rupees ($200)- an 
astronomical sum for the economy of such a village- and confiscation of the 
rifle. They have since apprehended two hunters and collected the fines. When 
asked what they did with the income, the author was told that the villagers 
bought medicine for the village, books for the school, and planted 34,000 trees.

Regulation at x-xi (The Bureau of International Affairs, Inc. 1992). 
<P>In addition, there are examples of villages that have initiated their own 
conservation programs. In Cocle, Panama, one author described the village as an 
"oasis" surrounded by very poor towns. Its success was due to conservation 
programs started by the villagers, with help from programs like CARE and the 
Smithsonian Institute (SI). They began by raising pigs and growing Caribbean 
pine (for lumber) and added a project on agroforestry where vegetable crops are 
grown in combination with trees. Iguana management began when a woman from SI 
told the villagers that it was important to save the species and that they could 
possibly sell the animal. The people also started an aquaculture project to 
raise talapia (a fish). The village was virtually centered around the projects, 
with income going to village activities and families. The author noted that he 
"had witnesse[d] a rural community in the midst of abject poverty as reflected 
in the surrounding villages that was motivated to conserve . . . species because 
it thought it was the right thing to do."<EM> Id.</EM> at x.

<P><A name=N_134_>134. </A>A forfeiture action is an <EM>in rem</EM> proceeding 
in which property is considered to be the offender. The claimant must establish 
an interest in the item subject to forfeiture. Once the claimant has established 
standing, the government must establish probable cause for the forfeiture. The 
burden then shifts to the defendant to prove that the property is not subject to 
forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. U.S. v. 3,210 Crusted Sides of

the government had to establish that the parakeets were imported into the United 
States in violation of the laws of Peru. The testimony at trial established that 
Peruvian Supreme Decree No. 934-73-AG prohibits the exportation of wild live 
animals originating from the forest or jungle region, from anywhere in the 
national territory. The court stated that the decree was sufficient in and of 
itself to establish probable cause to believe that the birds had been imported 
in violation of Peruvian law. <EM>Id.</EM> at 1113.

of "innocent owner" was not available in actions under the Lacey Act. The court 
stated that although there was no published opinion regarding the issue, the 
legislative history of the amendments to the Lacey Act <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>unequivocally establishes that the defense of 'innocent owner' is not 
available in forfeiture actions of wildlife brought pursuant to this Act . . . a 
violator does not have to forfeit his illegal shipment unless the Government can 
prove that he knowingly violated the Act or failed to exercise due care. The 
strict liability forfeiture section of these amendments would allow the 
protection of various species from harmful illegal trade by withdrawing illegal 
shipments from the marketplace even when the violation itself is inadvertent.
