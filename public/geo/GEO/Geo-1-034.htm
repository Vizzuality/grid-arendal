came into force in 1975. As of 1 March 2000, 119 states were Contracting Parties 
and many others were poised to join. Ramsar is the only global environmental 
treaty dealing with a particular ecosystem. </FONT></P>

</FONT></STRONG>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>For the purpose of the treaty, 
  "<STRONG>wetlands are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural 
  or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, 
  fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at 
  low tide does not exceed six meters</STRONG>". </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Wetlands have fundamental ecological 
  functions, as regulators of water regimes and as habitats supporting a rich 
  biodiversity.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Wetlands constitute a resource of 
  great economic, cultural, scientific and recreational value that must be 
  maintained.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Progressive encroachment on, and loss 
  of, wetlands constitute serious and sometimes irreparable environmental damage 
  that must be avoided.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Wetlands should be restored and 
  rehabilitated, whenever possible.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Wetlands should be conserved by 
  ensuring their<STRONG> <U>wise use</U></STRONG>. Wise use is defined as 
  <I>"sustainable utilization for the benefit of mankind in a way compatible 
  with the maintenance of the natural properties of the ecosystem"</I> – 
  sustainable utilization is understood as <I>"human use of a wetland so that it 
  may yield the greatest continuous benefit to present generations while 
  maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future 
  generations"</I>. ‘Wise use’ may also require strict protection.</FONT>

  take place in Spain in 2002) and approves resolutions, recommendations and 
  technical guidelines to further the application of the Convention.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Conference has adopted a 
  <B>Strategic Plan 1997-2002</B> to guide the implementation of the Convention. 
  Parties report on its application at each session of the Conference. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The <B>Standing Committee</B> includes 
  Regional Representatives of Ramsar’s six regions, and meets annually.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The <B>Scientific and Technical Review

  Convention.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The <B>Ramsar Bureau</B> 
  (secretariat), which shares headquarters with IUCN - The World Conservation 
  Union, in Gland, Switzerland, coordinates the day-to-day activities of the 
  Convention.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Missions in Geneva and/or the 
  Embassies in Bern are the diplomatic channel used by the Bureau. In addition, 
  each country designates an ‘Administrative Authority’ as its focal point for 
  the Convention.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Convention works closely with 
  other environment-related conventions and institutions. It has a Joint Work 
  Plan with the Convention on Biological Diversity, and Memoranda of Cooperation 
  with the Conventions on Desertification, Migratory Species, and World 
  Heritage. The Bureau also works with funding institutions such as the World 
  Bank and the GEF. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Countries are encouraged to establish 
  National Wetland Committees, or Ramsar Committees, involving all relevant 
  government institutions at central and state/province level dealing with water 
  resources, development planning, protected areas, biodiversity, tourism, 
  education, development assistance, etc. The participation of NGOs and interest 
  groups is also actively encouraged. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Ramsar sites facing problems related 
  to the maintenance of their ecological character can be placed by the country 
  concerned on a special list, the "<B>Montreux Record</B>", and technical 
  assistance to help solve the problems may be requested.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Countries can make applications to the 
  <B>Ramsar Small Grants Fund</B> to implement wetland conservation and wise use 
  projects.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Regional Ramsar meetings are held 
  periodically. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Convention publishes technical and 
  information/education materials, including the <I>Ramsar Newsletter</I>, and 
  maintains a number of electronic communication tools: a comprehensive Web site 
  and an electronic mailing list, the "Ramsar Forum", as well as specific 
  mailing lists for focal points in the member states.<B> </B>A 22’ video on the 
  Convention’s approach to wetland conservation and wise use, a video on the

nine Ramsar Handbooks presenting the guidelines adopted by the Conference of the 
Parties over the years in the areas of: wise use of wetlands; national wetland 
policies; laws and institutions; wetlands and river basin management; community 
participation; education and public awareness; development of the Ramsar List; 
management planning; and international cooperation.</FONT></P><B>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Convention has established procedures 
to formally recognize international organizations, including NGOs, as its 
Partners. So far, BirdLife International; IUCN - The World Conservation Union; 
Wetlands International; and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have been given 
that status. The Bureau also cooperates with many other international and 
national NGOs.</FONT></P><B>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Budget </FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Conference of the Parties adopts a 
core budget administered by the Ramsar Bureau. The core budget for the year 2000 
amounts to three million Swiss francs. Each Party pays a percentage related to 
its contribution to the UN budget (from a minimum of 0.01% to a maximum of 25%). 
Many countries and other donors also make contributions to special Ramsar Bureau 
projects, including the Ramsar Small Grants Fund.</FONT></P>
