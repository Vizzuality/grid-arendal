<H2><A name=story1>Government reports on flood damage and 
reconstruction</A></H2>
<P>Finance Minister Luisa Diogo told the country's parliament, the Assembly of 
the Republic, on 24 October that total losses, direct and indirect, to the 
Mozambican economy arising from the February cyclones and floods are now 
calculated at $600 million. 
<P>Giving a report from the government on flood damage and the efforts at 
reconstruction, Diogo said this figure broke down into $273 million in physical 
damage and destruction, $247 million in lost production, $48 million in lost 
exports, and $31 million in increased imports. 
<P>She said that the impact of the floods has forced the government to reduce 
its projections for this year's economic growth downwards from 6 percent to just 
3.8 per cent growth in Gross Domestic Product. Projections for inflation in 2000 
have been adjusted from less than 10 per cent to 12 per cent. 
<P>Diogo confirmed that most of the money for post- flood reconstruction pledged 
at a donors' conference held in Rome in early May has not yet arrived. At Rome, 
donors promised $452.9 million dollars. So far, however, donations reconfirmed 
amount to $259 million, of which $146.2 million correspond to bilateral 
agreements. Just $69 million has so far been disbursed. 
<P>For the first time, donors agreed to finance the Mozambican private sector. 
The government had asked for $77.7 million for the reconstruction needs of 
private companies hit by the floods. Donors have promised $40 million, of which 
$17.5 million has been made available. 
<P>This money will be disbursed in the form of bank loans at preferential 
interest rates. Diogo said the interest rates charged will be between eight and 
10 percent, with a grace period of a year, and repayment periods of up to five 
years. 
<P>Diogo said $10.5 million has so far been spent on repairing roads damaged by 
the floods, notably those stretches of the main north-south highway that were 
cut by the Incomati river, and by the Limpopo . 
<P>The floods completely paralysed all railway lines in the south of the 
country. Nonetheless, the publicly owned ports and railway company, CFM, was 
able to reopen the lines from Maputo to South Africa and Swaziland in late 
February, and by June, the worst-hit railway, the Limpopo line that runs from 
Maputo to Zimbabwe, was reopened as far as Chokwe, in Gaza. 
<P>The total cost of repairing flood damage to the railways was $7.3 million, of 
which only $1.1 million came from a donation. The rest was CFM's own funds. A 
further $60 million is expected (mainly from the United States) which will allow 
the thorough rehabilitation of the Limpopo line. 
<P>In order to rescue some of the 2000 harvest in flood-hit areas, kits of seeds 
and tools for use in the second plantings were distributed to 155,000 families. 
However, this was only 71 per cent of the 218,000 families in need. 
<P>For the 2000/2001 agricultural campaign, the government plans to distribute 
97,478 kits to peasants in the provinces recovering from the floods. 
<P>Diogo said that 43,400 families needed resettlement, 22,000 plots of land 
have been demarcated, and 9,800 new houses have been built. In addition, a 
number of families have been provided with building materials. 
<P>Diogo said that, at the height of the crisis, when there were 80,000 people 
crammed into the largest government accommodation centre (at Chihaquelane in 
Gaza), it was "miraculous" that major epidemics had been avoided. 
<P>In the flood stricken areas, malaria was rampant. Thus in Gaza, from January 
to July, 495,804 cases of malaria were diagnosed, 222 of whom died. As for the 
rainy season that is now starting, Diogo said that the latest SADC (Southern 
African Development Community) weather forecasts indicate that central 
Mozambique is particularly at risk of higher than normal rainfall. 
<P>
<H4>Debate in Assembly</H4>
<P>On 25 October the Assembly continued the debate on reconstruction. However, 
it was hindered by Renamo, who claimed that the government's report on the 
matter was incomplete. 
<P>Renamo deputy Luis Boavida claimed that before any debate could be held, a 
"previous question" should be answered - namely why the government report 
scarcely mentioned Cyclone Hudah, which had struck parts of northern Mozambique 
in April, and concentrated entirely on the February disaster in the south and 
centre of the country. Boavida claimed that the government was thus undermining 
national unity. 
<P>He was backed up by other Renamo deputies, but Assembly chairman Eduardo 
Mulembue overruled this attempt to block debate. 
<P>Most of the Renamo speeches complained of alleged discrimination amongst 
disaster victims, and that the government was only interested in the southern 
provinces. 
<P>"In the south, houses are being built of cement, but in the centre and north 
there is nothing", claimed Almeida Tambara. 
<P>"Anything north of the Save (the river marking the boundary between southern 
and central Mozambique) doesn't count for Frelimo ", exclaimed Manecas Daniel. 
"It is Frelimo and not Renamo that has a plan to divide the country". 
<P>"The people received no support", he said. "I am aware that the floods in the 
south were extremely serious. But those who live in Nampula and Zambezia are 
also Mozambicans. If we accept this report, we're in favour of dividing the 
country". 
<P>Facts about Hudah were contained in the report, given on 24 October, by the 
Assembly's own Social Affairs Commission, which sent teams to Nampula and 
Zambezia (including Frelimo and Renamo deputies) in May. 
<P>The Commission's report gave the total death toll from Hudah as six (four in 
Zambezia and two in Nampula). The main damage was to about 3,700 houses, mostly 
traditional huts. In the February catastrophe, when every river south of Beira 
burst its banks, the death toll that reached 699, and 650,000 people were 
affected. 
<P>The Social Affairs Commission concluded that in Nampula "the situation of 
natural disasters is not alarming" - a judgement from which the Renamo members 
of the Commission did not dissociate themselves. 
<P>Only one opposition deputy treated Diogo courteously. He was Maximo Dias, 
general secretary of the Mozambican National Movement (MONAMO), one of the minor 
parties allied to Renamo in the Electoral Union coalition. His references to the 
government won him dismay from his own side, and applause from the Frelimo 
benches. "Whether we like it or not, this is the de facto government", he said. 
He even praised Diogo for "your competence in the economic and financial areas". 

<P>But Dias went on to criticise the government for not providing enough support 
for businesses hit by the floods. He called for loans to such businessmen at 
interest rates lower than those proposed by the government. Dias called for 
these loans to be interest free, or for an interest rate that would just cover 
the administrative expenses. 
<P>Jose Samo Gudo, from another of Renamo's coalition partners, FUMO (Mozambique 
United Front), wondered if the banks would demand guarantees from those applying 
for loans: if so, what guarantee could a businessman who had lost everything in 
the floods give ? He called for different interest rates and repayment periods - 
one for circulating capital, and a more favourable one for investment. 
<P>For Frelimo, Carolina Chemane said that business people complain that they 
were not consulted about the forms of credit they are being offered. She said 
they are also "harassed" by tax collectors about this year's corporation tax - 
even though the Finance Ministry has said that corporation tax will not be 
demanded from flood-stricken businesses this year. 
<P>From both Renamo and Frelimo deputies came calls to improve the quality of 
houses provided for resettled victims. 
<P>The Minister of Public Works and Housing, Roberto White, said that most of 
the donor money for resettlement is channelled through NGOs. The government had 
tried to give some guidance as to the sort of houses that should be provide - 
but some of the "solutions" found by NGOs "are not to our liking, such as the 
houses that have been built without windows". 
<P>He stressed that his Ministry's first concern had been to restore supplies of 
safe drinking water, since the floods had knocked out and contaminated large 
numbers of wells. According to White, 135 new wells and boreholes had been 
provided in the central provinces (75 in Sofala and 56 in Manica), and 117 in 
the south (48 in Inhambane, 49 in Gaza and 20 in Maputo).

<H2><A name=story2>PROAGRI 2001 gets green light</A></H2>
<P>Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Helder Muteia on 3 November said 
that all conditions for the continuous implementation of the country's National 
Agriculture Development Programme (PROAGRI) have been met. 
<P>Speaking to journalists in Maputo at the end of a three-day meeting to 
evaluate the current status of PROAGRI, Muteia said that the project's donors 
had guaranteed funding for the implementation of activities for 2001. 
<P>PROAGRI started implementation in 1999, and it will cost about $202 million 
during it five-year period, with donors disbursing $42 million each year. 
<P>Muteia also said that under the project his ministry has to train cadres to 
work in provinces, and currently 24 technicians are being trained. The ministry 
envisages transferring of a further 40 technical staff to districts that will 
have a pivotal role in the implementation of the programme in their catchment 
areas. 
<P>The ministry is also to revise the list of products to be included in the 
KRII Programme signed with Japan - under this programme the ministry imports 
chemicals from Japan.

<P>
<H2><A name=story3>Calls for sweet potato planting</A></H2>
<P>The Mozambican scientific community has called for the massive planting of a 
variety of sweet potato with an orange pulp to eradicate malnourishment and 
supply vitamin A. 
<P>The call was made on 24 October in Maputo during a national seminar on the 
promotion of the planting of the orange pulp sweet potato. According to Isabel 
Andrade, the coordinator of the regional research network (SARRNET) for root 
crops like sweet potatoes and cassava, the promotion of orange pulp sweet potato 
is an alternative aimed at reducing the high costs involved in the purchase of 
vitamin A capsules - a strategy currently used to deal with deficiency in the 
vitamin. 
<P>For his part, Manuel Amade of the National Agricultural Research Institute 
(INIA) claimed that, if the planting of this variety of sweet potato is well 
received in the countryside, it will be possible to cut child deaths caused by 
diseases such as measles by about 50 per cent. He believed that the child 
mortality rate can be reduced to between 25 and 35 per cent, without spending 
vast sums. 
<P>The total land where the bulb is currently planted is just 55 hectares in the 
southern provinces of Maputo and Gaza. The authorities are to distribute sweet 
potato seeds to 91,000 families in the two provinces, and a further 15,000 
families in the central Sofala province in November.

<P>
<H2><A name=story4>Incomati water for MISP</A></H2>
<P>The government believes that the Incomati river can be used to supply the 
huge amounts of water required by the planned Maputo Iron and Steel Project 
(MISP), according to the Minister of Public Works, Roberto White. 
<P>MISP is a factory that would produce two million tonnes of steel slabs a 
year, using magnetite from South Africa and Mozambican natural gas as its main 
raw materials. 
<P>Water for the project has been a headache. Steel plants use enormous 
quantities of water for cooling: initially it was said that MISP would require 
67 million litres of water a day, a figure that was later scaled down, with no 
explanation, to 15 million litres a day. 
<P>The government has always made it clear that MISP cannot take its water from 
the nearest large river, the Umbeluzi, which is the source of Maputo's drinking 
water. 
<P>White said evaluation shows that the Incomati river could be used by MISP. 
This was because of the storage capacity of the Corumana dam, on the Incomati's 
main tributary, the Sabie. 
<P>This, however, would require a lengthy pipeline to carry the water to the 
MISP site on the outskirts of Maputo. There is a growing demand for Incomati 
water for agricultural purposes, notably by the two sugar plantations on the 
lower reaches of the river. 
<P>
<HR align=center SIZE=1 width="100%">

<P>
<H2><A name=story5>Agreement on natural gas</A></H2>
<P>The Mozambican government, the state-owned National Hydrocarbon Company 
(ENH), and the South African company SASOL, on 26 October signed three 
agreements on the joint development of the Pande and Temane natural gas fields 
in the southern province of Inhambane, and on a gas pipeline to South Africa. 
<P>Under these agreements Pande and Temane will be treated as a single field. 
ENH and SASOL (the former with a 30 per cent share, and the latter with 70 per 
cent) will work in partnership to develop the two fields. Sasol will also have 
rights to prospect for hydrocarbons in the areas surrounding the known Pande and 
Temane deposits. 
<P>Under the pipeline accord, SASOL and an ENH subsidiary will jointly own and 
build a pipeline from Temane to Ressano Garcia on the South African border, 
which will take 120 million gigajoules a year to South African clients. Gas will 
also be transported to Maputo, for use in the Maputo Iron and Steel Project 
(MISP). 
<P>The pipeline will also freely transport a share of the Mozambican 
government's royalty gas to up to five points along the pipeline route. 
<P>This agreement means that the American corporation ENRON has given up its 
rights to the Pande field. 
<P>Building of the pipeline is scheduled to start in June 2001, and will be 
concluded in 2004. The total length of the pipeline, from Temane to Secunda, 
will be 895 kilometres. 
<P>According to SASOL, the focus will first be on Temane, where the gas is at 
significantly higher pressure than at Pande.

<P>
<H2><A name=story6>Agreement on heavy sands</A></H2>
<P>The Mozambican government and the mining company, Corridor Sands, signed two 
agreements on 27 October that establish the guidelines for mining heavy sands in 
the district of Chibuto, in the southern province of Gaza. 
<P>The project is costed at about $1 billion, and will involve the 
transformation of ilemite, a heavy mineral found in the sands, into titanium, 
zirconium, and ruthenium. 
<P>The agreements cover the mining of heavy minerals, and the establishment of a 
processing plant and smelters, as well as fiscal benefits. 
<P>In the initial stage Corridor Sands would spend about $500 million on mining 
activities, starting in 2002.

<H2><A name=story7>Denmark pledges $200 million</A></H2>
<P>Denmark has pledged to commit about $200 million to finance development 
projects in Mozambique, until 2004. 
<P>The amount covers technical assistance, support for environmental projects, 
and support for the development of the private sector in a business-to-business 
programme. 
<P>The two governments have a strategy under which cooperation is concentrated 
on agriculture, education and energy supply. Furthermore, Mozambique receives 
general budget support and support for democratic institutions such as the 
parliament and legal system.

October, under which the latter is to provide a credit of about $6.5 million for 
a post-flood road rehabilitation project in Manica and Sofala. 
<P>The credit, to be channelled through the German Rebuilding Credit Institute 
(KFW), is part of the pledges made by Germany at the donor conference on 
post-flood reconstruction needs held in Rome in early May.

<P>The emergency repair of the electricity grid in the cities of Maputo and 
Matola, damaged by the torrential rains and floods of February, has been held up 
because of delays in securing from the Finance Ministry exemptions from customs 
duties and Value Added Tax (VAT) on imports of necessary equipment, reports 
"Noticias" on 4 November. 
<P>The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) has pledged a loan of 
$12 million for the rehabilitation of the electricity grid in Maputo and Gaza 
provinces. In Gaza some of the ongoing rehabilitation work is being funded by 
the South African electricity company ESKOM. 
<P>EDM is planning to use the DANIDA money to rehabilitate the power lines to 
four Maputo and seven Matola suburbs, and also to make repairs in some outlying 
districts of Maputo province.

<P>The Mozambican government is introducing new procedures, whereby visas can be 
issued at border posts. 
<P>Under previous policy, all visitors to the country were supposed to obtain 
their entry visas from Mozambican embassies or consulates. Under the new regime, 
an entry visa will cost 300,000 meticais (about $18) paid at the entry point, 
and its renewal will cost 150,000 meticais. 
<P>Tourism Minister Fernando Sumbana said that the implementation of the new

<H2><A name=story12>Deputy Attorney-General appointed</A></H2>
<P>President Joaquim Chissano has appointed Edmundo Alberto as Deputy 
Attorney-General. Alberto was Deputy Interior Minister from 1991 to 1996, but 
was removed at the same time as Interior Minister, Manuel Antonio, who was 
sacked following repeated scandals in the police and prisons. 
<P>President Chissano removed all the top figures in the Attorney- General's 
office in July. The office had fallen into disrepute with public battles 
conducted in the media between the then Attorney-General Antonio Namburete and 
one of his assistants, Afonso Antunes. 
<P>The major issue was the failure of the Attorney-General's Office to bring to 
justice any of those implicated in the country's largest bank fraud - the theft 
of 144 billion meticais (about $14 million at the exchange rate of the time) 
from the Commercial Bank of Mozambique (BCM) in 1996.

<P>Pedro Gonzalez, the Cuban ambassador in Maputo, told AIM that the efficacy of

<P>A small scale cashew producer in northern Mozambique claims that his factory 
will be the first Mozambican cashew processor to export nuts that are salted and 
packaged, ready for consumption. 
<P>To date, according to Jurg Reisser, director-general of Cabo-Caju, in the 
northern province of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique has only exported a semi-finished 
product. 
<P>Reisser, said that his company will shortly start exporting 6,000 kilos per 
month of entirely processed, packeted and ready for table nuts to guarantee its 
sustainability. 
<P>The nuts will bear the brand of the Portuguese coffee company, "Delta Cafe". 
<P>Cabo-Caju was built from scratch through World Bank funding to the tune of 
$1.4 million. The company has the capacity to process 1,200 tonnes of raw nuts a 
year, and it started operations with 150 workers. It is expected that the figure 
will increase to 350 within two to three months when it reaches full production.

<P>The governor of the northern province of Nampula, Abdul Razak Noormahomed, 
has hit on a novel approach to the problem of late payment of wages to teachers, 
health workers and other state employees. 
<P>Razak has ordered that as from now Nampula Provincial Directors will not 
receive their salaries until all their subordinates in the outlying districts 
have been paid. 
<P>Noormahomed had been angered on his visits around the province to find that 
regularly people on the state payroll did not receive their wages before the end 
of the month. Thus in the district of Lalaua, he found that some 200 teachers 
and other education staff had not been paid for the previous two months.

Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports, and Chissano swore Jeque into office on 25 
October. 
<P>But Jeque, a former footballer, had tried to conceal details of his past from 
the President. In 1997, Jeque had been expelled from the state apparatus for a 
serious disciplinary offence.

<P>Exports generated by the central province of Sofala have increased by 60 per 
cent since 1996, according to provincial governor Felicio Zacarias, speaking at 
a session of the provincial government held on 2 November in the district of 
Gorongosa, and chaired by President Joaquim Chissano. 
<P>By far the most important export from Sofala is prawns, which accounted for 
61 per cent of the total. The province's other major exports are timber and 
cotton. 
<P>Zacarias said that over the same period the province's imports had shrunk by 
26 per cent. This was largely because Sofala had become self-sufficient in 
grain. 
<P>The health service in Sofala had expanded by 50 per cent - from 101 health 
units in 1995 to 151 units in 1999, with a similar success in education, water 
supply, and the expansion of the telecommunications network.
