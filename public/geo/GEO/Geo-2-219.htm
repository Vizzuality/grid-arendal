      large and growing market for the products and services of socially 
      responsible businesses. These studies show that American consumers are 
      increasingly integrating their social and environmental values into their 
      purchasing and investing choices – and are seeking to support companies

  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>The studies show that between 40 and 50 million Americans -- about 25% 
      of the adult population -- are beginning to make these value-based choices 
      in more and more product categories. Taken together, these studies show 
      that when price and quality are comparable, socially responsible 
      businesses have the advantage.
      <P>If you own or work for a socially responsible business, these studies 
      are a gold mine for understanding current social and marketing trends -- 
      and developing strategies for taking advantage of the trends. The studies 
      have data useful for marketing and business plans. And they underscore how 
      important socially responsible businesses are to our society.</P>
      <P><B>Social Trends: Common Concerns</B></P>
      <P>Americans increasingly share common concerns about the future. Many 
      leading polls, including a comprehensive study by the Harwood Group, show 
      that the majority of Americans across all walks of life, name problems 
      such as greed and selfishness, the deteriorating environment, increasing 
      stress on families and communities, and the growing gap between 'have' and 
      'have nots' as major obstacles endangering America's future (see Figure 
      1).</P>
      <P><IMG height=222 src="Geo-2-219_files/B44mil1.gif" width=500></P>
      <P>The Harwood Group study also shows that as Americans go about their 
      everyday lives -- making decisions about work, purchases and investments 
      -- they are seeking to reclaim core values such as relationships, 
      meaningful work, economic security, personal safety, quality education for 
      their children, thriving communities and a healthy planet.<BR></P>
      <P><B>Social Trends: A New Worldview -- A New Mainstream</B></P>
      <P>If Americans share so many common concerns, why is there so much 
      disagreement about how to solve our problems?</P>
      <P>A path-breaking study, <I>The Integral Culture</I>, by Paul Ray for the 
      Institute for Noetic Sciences and the Fetzer Institute, set out to answer 
      this question. If you read only one study this year to understand social 
      and market trends for your business and your efforts to improve society -- 
      this is the one.</P>
      <P>What Ray discovered is that there are three competing worldviews, or 
      paradigms, in America today (see Figure 2). People's worldviews, the sum 
      total of their assumptions and values, determine their beliefs and 
      practices. </P>
      <P><IMG height=235 src="Geo-2-219_files/B44mil2.gif" width=465></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Figure 2: Key Worldview 
        Segments</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>These three contemporary worldviews all have long historical roots. 
      What Ray calls the Traditionalist or Heartlander paradigm was the 
      worldview that dominated in the early days of the United States, when 
      Europeans first began to arrive here. A faith-based worldview, it has 
      changed over the years and now includes many people who would identify 
      themselves as part of the religious right. It is declining rapidly and now 
      includes about 56 million Americans, about 29% of the adult population. 
      Heartlanders propose to solve today's problems by returning to what worked 
      earlier in this century.</P>
      <P>The Modernist worldview is what most people would call the mainstream. 
      It includes about 88 million Americans, about 47% of the adult population. 
      The Modernist worldview emerged with the industrial revolution and became 
      the dominant paradigm early in this century. It grew rapidly throughout 
      this century, but is now leveling off. Modernists believe that progress 
      and the good life are defined by increasing material wealth. Modernists 
      recognize that there are problem facing society but believe they can be 
      fixed by adjusting the present system. Almost all of our contemporary 
      political, business, media and religious leaders share this worldview.</P>
      <P>A new worldview, the Cultural Creatives, began to emerge and grow 
      rapidly in the 1970s. It now includes about 44 million Americans, 24% of 
      the adult population. The Cultural Creatives believe society faces 
      significant problems and needs to reinvent its culture, institutions and 
      practices to solve them and provide a future for our children. Cultural 
      Creatives are seeking to reintegrate their values into their everyday 
      lives and are ready to take action on a wide range of social, 
      environmental and spiritual concerns.</P>
      <P>People come to the Cultural Creatives worldview from many different 
      pathways and issues -- environmental, social justice, civil rights, health 
      and healing, spiritual, new age. It's core values are ecological 
      sustainability; civil rights for women and communities of color; 
      self-actualization and spirituality; and social conscience and 
      optimism.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, although Cultural Creatives are 44 million strong and 
      growing rapidly, most Cultural Creatives think they represent a tiny, 
      minority worldview -- maybe as small as themselves and their ten best 
      friends. This happens for two reasons. First, because it is an emerging 
      worldview and people have come to it from many pathways, the worldview is 
      still highly fragmented. People within it don't yet share a common 
      language or recognize people who come to this worldview from different 
      pathways as allies.</P>
      <P>Second, one of the jobs of the dominant paradigm is to marginalize new 
      ideas. So the feedback from the Modernist mainstream is that Cultural 
      Creative thinking is a small, fringe worldview. Cultural Creatives don't 
      see themselves reflected in the media or the institutions of our times, so 
      it is easy to believe that there are not many people like them. This 
      phenomenon causes many Cultural Creatives to lie low, expressing their 
      values in their homes but not at work or other aspects of public life. 
      Likewise, it may be causing many socially responsible businesses to see 
      and act as if their market is much smaller than it really is.</P>
      <P>With 24% of the population and growing rapidly, the Cultural Creatives 
      are beginning to define the new mainstream. </P>
      <P><B>Market Trends: Cultural Creatives as Consumers </B></P>
      <P>Socially responsible businesses will recognize the profile of the 
      Cultural Creative as their customers: They are more likely to be women 
      than men. Their median age is 42 and although they come from all walks of 
      life, they are likely to be well educated and in the upper middle class 
      (see Figure 3).</P>

      <P>Cultural Creatives are information junkies. Their cognitive style is to 
      scan the horizon for information, delve into their interests, and then put 
      what they learn into the big picture. They are ready to take action on 
      their values, and especially in their homes, are already beginning to 
      integrate their values into their everyday decisions, purchases and 
      investments. This integration will continue to be a guiding imperative for 
      them -- and increasingly in the marketplace, at work and in other public 
      arenas.</P>
      <P>Cultural Creatives are careful consumers -- and experiential consumers, 
      they like to "kick the tires," learn from others, find out how and why 
      others are using products and services. They want the whole story on 
      products and services. They get their information from other people, print 
      and radio, but are low TV users (they don't see people like themselves on 
      TV). They desire integrity, authenticity and quality (see Figure 4). </P>

      <P>Whole Foods is an example of a company that understands and reaches the 
      Cultural Creative consumer. Compare a Whole Foods store to a mainstream 
      grocery such as a Safeway, and you'll get an immediate experience of the 
      difference between the Cultural Creative and Modernist paradigms in the 
      business world.<BR></P>
      <P><B>Market Trends: Growth Opportunities</B> </P>
      <P>Other recent market studies corroborate the Cultural Creatives trend. 
      Kaagen Research Associates identified a segment of 50 million Americans as 
      "socially responsible" in their purchasing and investing activities. In 
      the food purchasing category, The Hartman Group found a "new green 
      mainstream" of at least 45 million Americans. </P>
      <P>The growth of key Cultural Creative products and consumer practices are 
      showing up in other market surveys around the country. The sales of 
      organic food are growing at 20 - 25% per year, while the food industry 
      itself is growing at 3- 5% annually. The social investing market has more 
      than doubled in two years, now representing over $1.2 trillion. At least 
      84% of Americans would pay more for clothes made without sweatshop or 
      child labor. (See Figure 6).</P>

      <P><B>Market Trends: Cautions</B></P>
      <P>These same studies also provide insight into what it takes to reach 
      this market: A values-based approach is necessary but not sufficient. 
      Businesses must still satisfy the Cultural Creative consumer's core 
      purchase criteria.</P>
      <P>Indeed, several studies show that the social or environmental 
      characteristics of the product are the most important purchasing criteria 
      for only about 5 - 10% of this market. The Hartman Group calls these the 
      "True Greens." The True Greens will pay more and go way out of their way 
      to purchase responsible products from responsible companies. Many socially 
      responsible businesses are limiting their market to the True Greens, when 
      there is a much larger market out there -- the new mainstream of the 
      Cultural Creatives.</P>
      <P>For the rest of the Cultural Creatives market, businesses must first 
      reach them with the core purchasing criteria for the product (i.e. price, 
      quality, appearance, taste, availability, convenience) and then include 
      the social and environmental message.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, businesses must understand which social or environmental 
      message works with which product. For example, the Hartman Group found 
      that for many (but not all) food products, pesticide-free was the most 
      important environmental message. Other environmental messages, such as 
      chemical-free, risks to farm workers and soil erosion were less 
      effective.</P>
      <P>In short, for the socially responsible business marketing to the 
      Cultural Creatives, sales growth requires both satisfaction of the core 
      purchasing criteria for the particular product and the communication of 
      the social or environmental message.</P>
      <P><B>Market Trends: Lessons Learned</B></P>
      <P>It’s clear that these and other social trends are showing that the time 
      for socially responsible business is now. Market trends show a growing 
      market for socially responsible businesses and products.</P>
      <P>There is a growing segment of Americans, the Cultural Creatives, who 
      now number between 40 - 50 million people and are ready to act on their 
      social, environmental and spiritual values. They desire to integrate these 
      values into their everyday decisions, purchases and investments.</P>
      <P>Socially responsible businesses are uniquely positioned to deliver on 
      the core values of this segment of Americans. The Cultural Creatives are 
      clearly the target customers for socially responsible businesses. </P>
      <P>This market is larger and stronger than many socially responsible 
      businesses have measured. Many socially responsible businesses are 
      targeting just the "True Greens," which represent only about 5% - 10% of 
      this market. The large and growing size of the entire Cultural Creatives 
      market, the market's interest in integrating its values into purchasing 
      decisions, and the relatively small market share of most socially 
      responsible businesses and products mean that there is an enormous market 
      potential for socially responsible businesses.</P>
      <P>However, the market is fragmented and does not yet share a common 
      language or identity. Careful market segmentation and research is required 
      to reach it successfully.</P>
      <P>Market success depends on satisfying consumers core purchase 
      requirements and communicating the larger social and environmental 
      message. No one message works -- there's no magic set of words. However, 
      when price and quality are comparable socially responsible businesses will 
      increasingly have the advantage.</P>
      <P>As Harvey Hartman, president of the Hartman Group put it: "The 'green' 
      consumer is now mainstream. There is significant market potential for 
      earth-sustainable products. It is not merely a market niche. It is a 
      market that is here to stay and is still untapped."</P>
