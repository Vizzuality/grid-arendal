      ENVIRONMENT FROM SEA-BASED ACTIVITIES</FONT></H4>
      <P align=justify><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><FONT size=+1>6.1 
      </FONT>The Technical Secretary of IMO introduced this topic, recalling 
      that the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of IMO at its 35th 
      session in 1994 had requested GESAMP to evaluate all available data 
      sources of input of oil into the marine environment from sea-based 
      activities, i.e., those related to shipping and offshore activities, and 
      to develop approaches that might in future be used for the provision of 
      input data.</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><FONT size=+1>6.2 
      </FONT>The first meeting of the GESAMP Working Group was held in London in 
      November 1997. A description of this meeting and its outcome was provided 
      by the Chairman of the Working Group (GESAMP-XXVIII/6). He described in 
      detail the proposed Terms of Reference and scope of the Working Group’s 
      task, and the progress made at the meeting on 6 topics - transportation 
      sources, exploration and production, coastal refineries, reception 
      facilities, waste material dumped at sea and natural seeps. The Working 
      Group has initiated discussion of the topics, collection of relevant data 
      and consideration of specific topics, e.g., uncertainties around estimates 
      of oil volumes delivered by tankers.</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><FONT 
      size=+1>6.3</FONT> The report solicited the following major comments for 
      consideration by the Working Group, others were also noted and will be 
      considered. These are not in order of priority:</FONT></P>
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(i) The work of the Working 
        Group is primarily a scoping exercise for estimating inputs, not 
        necessarily a definitive exercise;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(ii) As part of the context of 
        the study, consideration should be made of the institutional framework 
        in which the study is conducted and to which the study provides data, 
        analysis and insight, i.e. the MARPOL 73/78 Convention. A broad view of 
        the topic of oil releases to the sea was valuable for public 
        understanding and an examination of institutional arrangements at a 
        range of levels. Mechanisms for conducting the evaluation of inputs 
        comprehensively should be made;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(iii) It is very important to 
        make estimates of the uncertainties of input quantities (e.g., tanker 
        cargos losses, size of spills) at the start of the project. Data sources 
        will be evaluated and an approach for making input estimates should be 
        developed, taking these uncertainties into account;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(iv) The long-term data 
        requirements for the task of estimating inputs should be determined 
        during the project. The location and arrangements of data storage and 
        access should be considered at an early stage;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(v) There was an important 
        geographic aspect to the task, hence it is worth considering developing 
        a GIS in support of the project. This would allow an analysis of the 
        distribution, size and trends of oil inputs around the globe;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(vi) Natural oil seeps should 
        be considered by the Working Group, although they are not strictly "an 
        activity". Seeps can contribute substantial amounts of oil to the sea, 
        their presence is often being confused with ship-based sources, and 
        their relative importance may vary geographically;</FONT> 
        <DD><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>(vii) Other sources of oil or 
        hydrocarbon inputs to the sea, such as those from land-based activities 
        and from aviation should be mentioned for context but not evaluated in 
        detail.</FONT> </DD></DL>
