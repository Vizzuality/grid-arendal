<H2>Ground-Level Ozone</H2>
<P><IMG align=right alt=Traffic height=222 src="Geo-2-040_files/traffic.gif" 
width=215>Ozone that occurs naturally in the upper atmosphere surrounding the 
Earth provides a filter for the damaging ultraviolet light emitted by the Sun. 
At ground level, ozone is harmful to living things. Ground-level ozone is an air 
pollutant that damages human health, vegetation, and many common materials. It 
is a key ingredient of urban smog.</P>
<H3>Sources</H3>
<P>Ground-level ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but rather is formed 
by gases called oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), 
which in the presence of heat and sunlight, react to form ozone. Ground-level 
ozone forms readily in the atmosphere, usually during hot weather. As a result, 
it is known as a "summer-time" air pollutant. Emissions of NOx are produced 
primarily when fossil fuels are burned in motor vehicle engines, power plants, 
and industrial boilers. There are hundreds of thousands of sources of VOC 
emissions including automobile emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, 
and consumer products like paints.</P>
<H3>Health &amp; Environmental Effects</H3><IMG align=left 
alt="Factory emitting smoke" height=287 src="Geo-2-040_files/factory.gif" 
width=216> 
<P>Repeated exposure to ozone pollution for several months may cause permanent 
structural damage to the lungs. Because ozone pollution usually forms in hot 
weather, anyone who spends time outdoors in the summer is at risk, particularly 
children, moderate exercisers, and outdoor workers.</P>
<P>Even when inhaled at very low levels, ground-level ozone triggers a variety 
of health problems including aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and 
increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and 
bronchitis.</P>
<P>Ground-level ozone is also responsible for 1 to 2 billion dollars in reduced 
crop production in the U.S. each year. Because ground-level ozone interferes 
with the ability of plants to produce and store food, they are more susceptible 
to disease, insects, other pollutants, and harsh weather. Ozone also damages the 
foliage of trees and other plants, ruining the appearance of cities, national 
parks, and recreation areas.</P><BR clear=all>
<H3>Regional Transport</H3>
<P>Under the Clean Air Act, EPA has set acceptable levels, called National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards, for ozone in the air we breathe. Some parts of 
the U.S. are currently unable to meet these standards. These areas are described 
as "nonattainment" areas. Tens of millions of Americans live in ozone 
"nonattainment" areas, primarily in parts of the Northeast, Lake Michigan area, 
Atlanta, southeastern Texas, and parts of California. Many of these 
nonattainment areas have focused a great deal of effort on reducing VOC and, in 
some cases, NOx emissions from stationary (factories) and mobile (vehicles) 
sources within their jurisdictions. In several cases, emission controls are not 
producing the reductions in ground-level concentrations of ozone needed to meet 
the national health standard.</P>
<H2 align=center><FONT color=#26590c>VOC+NOx+HEAT+Sunlight=Ozone</FONT></H2>
<P align=center><I>According to this simplified equation, volatile organic 
compounds and oxides of nitrogen react, in the presence of heat and sunlight, to 
form ozone.</I></P>
<P><IMG align=right alt=Cornfield height=158 src="Geo-2-040_files/cornfeld.gif" 
width=108>Ozone "precursors," such as NOx emissions, as well as ozone itself, 
can be carried hundreds of miles from their origins, causing air pollution over 
wide regions. Although many urban areas have made efforts to control ozone by 
reducing local NOx and VOC emissions, incoming ozone transported from upwind 
areas also needs to be addressed in order to meet the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards. High levels of ozone entering some nonattainment areas can 
make achieving the national ozone standard difficult and costly, unless upwind 
sources are identified and controlled. If these sources fall within a certain 
state's boundaries, it can take measures to control them. If, as is often the 
case, these sources fall beyond the political boundaries of that state, it must 
work with EPA and other states to reduce air pollution on a regional scale. 
Often, it is more cost-effective to reduce emissions from upwind sources than to 
control emissions from smaller and smaller businesses in the nonattainment areas 
being affected downwind.</P>
<P>Some regional strategies for reducing ground-level ozone include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>reducing NOx emissions from power plants and industrial combustion 
  sources<BR><BR>
  <LI>introducing low-emission cars and trucks<BR><BR>
  <LI>burning gasoline reformulated to reduce VOC, NOx, and other emissions. 
  </LI></UL><IMG align=left alt="Ozone Graphic" height=177 
src="Geo-2-040_files/newozone.gif" width=300> <BR>
<P><I>Ozone, VOC, and NOx air emissions from upwind industrial/urban areas 
contribute to ozone concentrations hundreds of miles downwind in rural and other 
urban areas. When combined with local air emissions, regionally transported 
ozone causes some areas to exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) for ozone. </I></P><BR clear=all><BR>
