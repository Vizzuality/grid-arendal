<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>In accordance with Articles 4 and 
12 of the Convention, and the relevant decisions of the Conference of the 
Parties, Parties to the Convention submit national greenhouse gas inventories to 
the Climate Change secretariat. These inventory data are provided in the 
national communications under the Convention by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. 
In addition, Annex I Parties submit annual national greenhouse gas 
inventories.</FONT></FONT> 
<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>This site contains summary tables 
and an on-line database of emission estimates for three main gases: 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>O, as well as for CO, 
NO<SUB>X</SUB>, NMVOCs, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. These data are in general available 
for <A href="http://194.95.39.33/infosrc.htf">1990 - 1997</A>.&nbsp; The 
emission estimates are presented in accordance with the source categories of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories (1996).</FONT></FONT> 
<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>This site contains only the most 
recently submitted information. In some cases, the most recent information for a 
period of years (e.g. 1990-1997) is based on different submissions, as 
information submitted from year to year does not necessarily include data for 
years previously submitted. Thus the data may not necessarily be consistent or 
comparable among years for a given Party.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT

reported, with the exception of rounding during data processing and corrections 
of typographical or calculation errors or omissions, therefore totals and 
sub-totals may differ from the sum of the individual components.</FONT></FONT>

for presentation of CH<SUB>4</SUB> and N<SUB>2</SUB>O in terms of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
equivalent are 21 and 310, respectively, for a 100 year time horizon (source:

<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>Emission estimates are presented 
in accordance with the source categories of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (1996), with 
the exception of emissions from burning of biomass. As some information has been 
reported following previous IPCC reporting formats, emissions estimates from 
burning of biomass from gases other than CO<SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp; are also provided 
where reported separately from other source categories.</FONT></FONT> 
<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>It should also be noted that the 
category "National Total" does not include emissions resulting from fuel sold to 
ships or aircraft engaged in international transport (international bunker fuel 
emissions). Furthermore, in the case of CO<SUB>2</SUB> , the "National Total" 
does not include emissions from biomass burning or emissions or removals from 
the land-use change and forestry sector.</FONT></FONT> 
<DD><BR><FONT face=Geneva,Arial><FONT size=-1>Blanks in the tables indicate 
emissions whose values are zero or not reported.</FONT></FONT>
