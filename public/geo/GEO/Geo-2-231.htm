        <P align=justify>The Nenets living in the Komi Republic are a small part 
        of the Nenets of Russia, who are officially re-ferred to as on of the 
        indigenous minorities of the North. At the same time, the Komi Nenets 
        appear to be the least understood ethnic group of Nenets, receiv-ing the 
        least attention. They are a total of 400 people out of the total Nenets 
        population of 34,000, i.e., a little more than 1% of the entire people, 
        whereas their proportion in the entire population of the Komi Re-public 
        is still less. 
        <P align=justify>An interpretation of the present-day legal and so-cial 
        situation of the Nenets in the Komi Republic re-quires some historical 
        digression. 
        <P align=justify>Over a long time period, the northern groups of the 
        Komi people (Komi-Izhemtsy) gradually moved northward, where they became 
        neighbors of the Ne-nets, the latter being partly assimilated. In the 
        territory of the present-day Komi (except the area annexed in 1959, 
        which will be discussed below), by the end of the 19th century there 
        were about 400 Nenets, and in 1926 their number reached 900 and remained 
        almost unchange until 1939. They all lived in three former regions of 
        the Republic which at that time were re-garded as the territories of the 
        Extreme North: there were quite few of them in the Izhemskiy; somewhat 
        more in Ust-Tsilemskiy; and the majority in Ust-Usinskiy. By that time, 
        they had all been strongly assimilated - over three fourths of them 
        referred to Komi as their native language. 
        <P align=justify>The extraction of coal deposits of the Vorkuta Basin, 
        started in the middle of the 1930s, dealt a heavy blow to reindeer 
        herding of the Ust-Usinskiy District Nenets. The workers employed were 
        convicts, and work was done with loss of life and with neglect of the 
        indigenous people of the Bolshaya Zemlya Tundra, as was practiced at 
        that time. Coal production particularly increased during World War II 
        (over 12-fold between 1940 and 1945), the forthcoming victory justifying 
        all the costs. 
        <P align=justify>By the late 1950s, there remained about 200 Ne-nets in 
        the Izhemskiy and Ust-Tsilemskiy districts - the former Ust-Usinskiy (in 
        1959 this was a territory of the Pechora District and the Vorkuta and 
        Inta city councils) had almost no Nenets. Some died during the war and 
        the post-war hard period, and some migrated to the Nenets Okrug (in 
        those times it was referred to as "ethnic"). 
        <P align=justify>Subsequently, the number of Nenets unexpectedly 
        increased. The reason was that in the Nenets Okrug, on its eastern edge, 
        bordering to the Vorkuta City Council of Komi, coal deposits were also 
        discovered; and in 1954 a built-up area at the site of mine 
        con-struction became the Khalmer-Yu construction village (actually, 
        Khalmer-Yu is the Nenets word for ceme-tery). In 1957 the mine produced 
        its first coal, and by the end of 1959, the construction villages 
        Khalmer-Yu and Tsementozavodskiy, with the adjacent area of coal bed 
        occurrence, were transferred from the Nenets National Okrug to the Komi 
        ASSR. That was eco-nomically feasible. 
        <P align=justify>The nomad Nenets registered in the Khalmer-Yu village 
        began to be regarded as part of the Vorkuta population (both villages 
        were affiliated with the Vorkuta City Council). In fact, in the Komi 
        Republic, a substantial group of "city resident Nenets" devel-oped; they 
        were "city residents" only on paper and continued migrating between the 
        Komi and Nenets okrugs maintaining close and often kindred relations 
        with Nenets of both the Nenets and Yamalo-Nenets okrugs. 
        <P align=justify>At the same time, there remained a group of "rural" 
        Nenets - in the Ust-Tsilemskiy and Izhemskiy districts. It has been 
        assimilated by Komi to a considerably greater extent, and judging by 
        population data, their number has been declining, which does not apply 
        to the so-called Vorkuta "city residents".

        <P align=justify><B>*</B><I> Since we have no data available on 
        individual administrative units within the Republic, the table gives 
        data on the entire Nenets population of Komi, including a small number 
        of the Nenets living in southern districts and in Syktyvkar. But there 
        are not more than 50 such people.</I>

        width=200>When in 1980 the concept of "Regions of Residence of the 
        Peoples of the North" was developed, only the northwestern territories 
        of the Komi Republic were attributed to those regions - Izhemskiy and 
        Ust-Tsilemskiy districts - the area subordinated to the Usinskiy city 
        administration (the then city council), in addition to the village of 
        Usinsk and another village subordinated to the Inta city administration. 
        Thus, the Vorkuta Nenets remained outside of the approved territories of 
        the peoples of the North. 
        <P align=justify>There was a view that urban groups of indigenous 
        minorities do not lead a traditional mode of life. Judg-ing by constant 
        contact and exchange between the urban and rural populations, this view 
        is questionable, and, in the case of Vorkuta Nenets, erroneous. 
        <P align=justify>The paradox of the Komi Nenets situation lies in the 
        fact that only a minority of the indigenous popula-tion (those in "the 
        regions of residence…") enjoy all the rights they are entitled to. 
        According to the 1989 census, there were only 46 such Nenets; and by the 
        census of 1990, 60-70 people. The majority of them live on the lands of 
        their traditional residence - on the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra, becoming 
        second-rate people and being treated as a confounding factor. </P>
