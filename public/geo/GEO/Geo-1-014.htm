      <H1><FONT color=#cc0000>The Environmental Impacts of War</FONT></H1>
      <UL>For centuries, war has involved not only human conflict but also 
        environmental destruction in the forms of both 'collateral damage' and 
        deliberate destruction of environments. Environmental destruction has 
        been used as a war-winning strategy and as a punishment for defeated 
        opponents. The Romans routinely destroyed the crops of their enemies to 
        ensure their future dependence on Rome and the Russians have twice 
        destroyed their own crops and homes in a "scorched earth" policy to 
        prevent those resources from being useful to either Napoleon or Hitler. 
        The near extinction of America's once vast herds of buffalo was, in 
        part, linked to an assault against Indian tribes through their resource 
        base. 
        <P>As war has become increasingly technologically advanced so its 
        impacts on the environment have become more severe and longer-lasting. 
        In the case of the American war in <A 
        href="http://www.hatfieldgroup.com/featured/vietnam.htm">Vietnam</A>, 
        the destruction of forest ecosystems with broad-leaf herbicides has 
        directly impacted not only the ecosystems in which they were used, but 
        also has had long-term effects on human health. 
        <P>The environmental impacts of modern war can be grouped into three 
        areas:<BR><BR>
        <UL>1) The consequences of preparing for war. <BR>2) The immediate 
          effects of war. <BR>3) The aftermath of war.<BR><BR></UL>This 
        Eco-Compass feature identifies the major sources of the environmental 
        impacts of war and points the way to print and electronic resources 
        which clarify this subject.</UL>
      <H2><FONT color=#cc0000>Preparation</FONT></H2>
      <UL>The environmental repercussions of preparing for war include: 
        indirect impacts made through the diversion of resources from ecological 
        protection to military spending, and through the pollution caused by 
        arms production; and direct impacts through weapons testing and military 
        training.</UL>
      <H3>War Games and Military Training</H3>
      <UL>Military bases, especially airfields, require large areas of 
        land--much of it ecologically valuable--and often lead to the 
        destruction of any fauna perceived as hindering such activity (such as 
        birds congregating on runways). The construction of military bases tends 
        to destroy these environments irretrievably, especially in the case of 
        island bases. Large sectors of most countries are reserved for military 
        exercises, especially tank maneuvers, tactical missile exercises, 
        bombing exercises and artillery practice. In addition, some countries 
        reserve large areas for chemical and biological warfare exercises. In 
        those countries manufacturing weapons, areas may also be used for 
        testing missiles, chemical and biological warfare products, and nuclear 
        weapons. All of these activities severely degrade the natural ecosystems 
        and tend to be treated as exceptions to any regulatory measures to 
        protect the environment. 
        <P>When Soviet troops withdrew from former East Germany in 1992, 1.5 
        million tonnes of ammunition was destroyed. It was reported that most of 
        the ammunition was burned, without filters, in the open air and that 
        nitrogen oxides, highly toxic chemical dioxides, and heavy metals (e.g., 
        mercury) were released to the atmosphere. Under treaty, the munitions 
        should have been removed to Russia, but much of it was found buried on 
        site to avoid the expense of removal. Abandoned garrison towns around 
        Berlin have derelict barracks and villas, wreckage of army vehicles, 
        hidden waste tips with not only ammunition but million of gallons of 
        spent tank and truck oil, and chemical wastes. Officials have estimated 
        that the 4% of East German territory that was occupied by former Soviet 
        bases and facilities is severely polluted. In Brandenburg, north of 
        Berlin, where a third of the forces were concentrated, the environmental 
        damage damage exceeds Dm 10 billion. Germany had already paid Dm 13 
        billion to the Russian forces to help finance the withdrawal.</P></UL>
      <H3>The By-Products of Weapons Programs</H3>
      <UL>Military toxic waste poses an enormous threat to public health and 
        the environment. Vast amounts of toxic pollution left from the 
        production, storage, and testing of chemical, biological, nuclear, and 
        conventional weapons contaminate millions of acres awaiting 
        redevelopment. Millions of tons of obsolete weapons and ammunition await 
        destruction. Only recently has the full extent of the problem been 
        realized. Over 20,000 sites on more than 1,700 U.S. military facilities 
        are contaminated with conventional toxic wastes. Over 30,000 tons of 
        deadly chemical weapons await destruction. Estimated costs of addressing 
        these problems run as high as $65 billion.</UL>
      <H3>The Opportunity Cost of Weapons Spending</H3>
      <UL>According to the UNESCO, in 1971 the world spent 7.2% of its gross 
        national product on arms, compared to 5% on education and 2.5% on 
        health. 
        <P>Two days of global military spending (approx. $4.8 billion) is equal 
        to the annual cost of the UN Action Plan to halt Third World 
        desertification over 20 years. 
        <P>The US Department of Defense purchased 2,000 billion barrels of oil 
        for military use in 1989, enough to run all of the US public transport 
        system for 22 years. 
        <P>West German spending on military procurement and R&amp;D was $10.75 
        billion in 1985, the same as the estimated cost of cleaning up the West 
        German sector of the North Sea. 
        <P>In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government spent an annual average of 
        $275 million on waging war in Eritrea &amp; Tigre. An annual expenditure 
        of $50 million a year on tree planting and soil conservation would have 
        reversed desertification in the country and thereby helped to prevent 
        the million plus deaths in the 1985 famine. 
        <P>In under one hour of flight, an F-16 fighter plane burns up almost 
        twice as much fuel as the average American motorist during one year. 
        <P>In the former West Germany, German air force jets accounted for some 
        58% of air pollutants generated by all air traffic over its 
        territory.</P></UL>
      <H2><FONT color=#cc0000>War</FONT></H2>
      <UL>This century has seen a steady increase in the percentage of 
        civilian victims of war as well as an increase in the amount of 
        environmental damage caused by war. The desire to cripple an enemy's 
        economic ability to wage war leads to the targeting of industrial 
        facilities. However, as the technology of weapons has advanced, so too 
        has the technological level of the targets which are selected. This has 
        increased not only civilian causalities but also the incidence of 
        environmental destruction through the release of industrial 
chemicals.</UL>
      <H3>Human Consequences</H3>
      <UL>As we have seen in the current conflicts in Kosovo and the Gulf, 
        human deaths and the destruction of "military targets" are not the only 
        immediate consequences of war. Modern weapons rely on toxic chemicals 
        for much of their explosive force and propulsion. Hence they create 
        negative environmental impacts through their own composition as well as 
        their destructive power. 
        <P>When a heavy bomb goes off, it creates temperatures of approximately 
        3,000 degrees Celsius; this not only annihilates all flora and fauna but 
        also destroys the lower layers of soil, which can take anywhere from 
        1,500 to 7,400 years to regenerate. 
        <P>Although the weapons constitute the most obvious threat to the 
        environment, the targets that they destroy are also a highly significant 
        contributor to the environmental devastation of war. During the current 
        war in the Balkans, NATO has bombed petro-chemical plants in Pancevo and 
        Sremicica in the suburbs of Belgrade. These air raids destroyed a 
        plastics factory and an ammonia production unit within the complexes, 
        releasing toxins such as chlorine, ethylene dichloride, and vinyl 
        chloride monomer into the atmosphere. These chemicals not only have an 
        immediate and life-threatening effect on humans but also have a residual 
        effect on the environment. 
        <P>The Gulf War produced similar negative environmental impacts through 
        the targeting of oil tankers and oil production facilities. According to 
        the 1993 Marine Pollution Bulletin, 6-8 million barrels of crude oil was 
        spilled from sunken vessels (including Iraqi tankers) and from oil 
        transfer facilities such as the Kuwaiti Mina Al-Ahmadi Sea Island 
        terminal and Iraqi Mina Al Bakr loading terminal between January 19-28, 
        1991. Reports suggest that approximately 30,000 marine birds perished as 
        a result of this incident, and this figure excludes those that were 
        trapped in oil pools in the desert. Furthermore, approximately 20% of 
        mangroves were contaminated, 50% of coral reefs affected, and hundreds 
        of square miles of sea grass infected. 
        <P>Iraq's decision to deliberately destroy Kuwaiti oil production 
        facilities resulted in an approximate 5-6 million barrels per day of oil 
        being engulfed in flames. Tons of gaseous pollutants such as carbon 
        dioxide and sulfur dioxide (the primary element in acid rain) were 
        released into the atmosphere, causing black, greasy rains to fall in 
        Saudi Arabia and Iran and black snow in Kashmir (1,500+ miles away). 
        <P>Such ecological disasters have an immediate impact not only human 
        human but also on the flora and fauna of affected areas.</P></UL>
      <H2><FONT color=#cc0000>The Aftermath</FONT></H2>
      <UL>In the aftermath of modern wars, people are faced with having to 
        restore their natural resources as well as communities and lives. 
        However, the concentrated destructive power unleashed by modern weapons 
        means that in a relatively short period of time all the resources that a 
        community relied on can be destroyed. This often results in 
        environmentally ruinous population movements. The recent wars in Rwanda 
        and Kosovo are excellent illustrations of the quantity and 
        concentrations of refugees produced by modern armed conflict. The 
        immediate threat of death combined with the prospect of facing the 
        long-term hazards of war simply proves too much for many victims of war. 
        The resultant exodus to safer areas puts such a strain on the resources 
        of that region that its the economic and social fabric is irreversibly 
        altered. 
        <P>Perhaps more disturbing than the sheer destructive power of modern 
        weapons is the long-lasting nature of their effects. Munitions such as 
        Depleted Uranium (DU) shells used by anti-tank cannons and land mines 
        have long-term effects on everything that comes into contact with them. 
        <P>DU is used in alloy form in shells to make them penetrate targets 
        better. It is extremely dense, 1.7 times as dense as lead. As the shell 
        hits its target, it burns and releases uranium oxide into the air. The 
        poisonous and radioactive uranium is most dangerous when inhaled into 
        the body, where it will release radiation during the life of the person 
        who inhaled it. According to Robert Fisk of the <I>Independent</I> 
        newspaper in London, there is <A 
        href="http://www.islandpress.org/ecocompass/war/fisk2.html">evidence</A> 
        that the depleted uranium residue left in Iraq is responsible for a 
        large increase in stillbirths, children born with defects, childhood 
        leukemia and other cancers in southern Iraq near Basra, where most of 
        these shells were fired. Many U.S. veterans groups also say that DU 
        residues contributed to the condition called "Gulf War Syndrome". 
        <P>Land mines are cheap, devastating, and increasingly popular in 
        today's regionalized conflicts. According to the International Committee 
        of the Red Cross, they kill or maim between 1,000 and 2,000 people every 
        month. 100 million land mines now lie in wait around the world. Most 
        victims are civilians in peace time. The Save the Children Fund has 
        repeatedly stated that children are especially vulnerable to 
        anti-personnel mines. The injury or death of a parent directly affects 
        their welfare; their small size and curiosity increase risk of injury. 
        Childhood occupations, such as herding, expose them to greater 
        danger.</P></UL>
      <H2><FONT color=#cc0000>All's Fair in Love and War?</FONT></H2>
      <UL>It is often said that "from the ashes of destruction grow the roses 
        of success"; in modern war this is not the case. The unparalleled 
        destruction created in a short time span by toxic munitions; unexploded 
        weapons; the physical and biological effects of damage to soil and 
        landscape; and the human suffering resulting from the disruption of 
        social systems turn today's war zones into ecological disaster areas. 
        Fortunately, we have yet to deal with the long-term effects of 
        large-scale nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare. 
        <P>Despite the bleak outlook, there are hopes that in the future the 
        environmental consequences of war will be taken into account. 
        <P>&nbsp;In June 1998 the <A href="http://www.eli.org/ecw/">First 
        International Conference on Addressing the Environmental Consequences of 
        War</A> was held in Washington, DC. This conference addressed the legal, 
        scientific, and economic perspectives of the environmental consequences 
        of war. 
        <P>On May 3rd, 1999, the First Meeting of States Parties of the <A 
        href="http://www.un.org/Depts/mine/UNDocs/ban_trty.htm">Convention on 
        the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of 
        antipersonnel mines and on their destruction</A> will be held in Maputo, 
        Mozambique. In this forum, <A 
        href="http://www.mines.gc.ca/english/treaty/index.html">countries party 
        to the Convention</A> (as well as other interested states and 
        non-governmental organizations) will review progress since the <A 
        href="http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/english/news/press_releases/99_press/99_046-e.htm">March 
        1st, 1999, entry into force</A> of the Convention and set new goals for 
        increased international cooperation. 
        <P>The rapid proliferation of depleted uranium weapons is steadily 
        diminishing any battlefield advantage they currently provide to U.S. 
        forces. Depleted uranium weapons have already been acquired or are being 
        developed by the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Israel, 
        Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, and Taiwan. As 
        more countries develop and acquire depleted uranium munitions, and the 
        effects of DU munitions become more apparent, there will undoubtedly be 
        more reactions against the use of these weapons. Japan has already 
        forced the US Department of Defense to apologize for shooting 1,520 
        small caliber DU rounds in 1995 and 1996 on an uninhabited island near 
        Okinawa. U.S. military officials stated that approximately 64 pounds of 
        depleted uranium were recovered from the Japanese island. 
        <P>We must hope that the international community does not become 
        oblivious to the environmental impacts of war by the sanitized images of 
        "surgical" air strikes we are presented with in the news media. The 
        anti-land mine movement is proving that public opinion can remove 
        particularly odious weapons from the arsenals of our armies.</P></UL>
