<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Probably no other distinct 
plant community has attracted as much curiosity and scientific attention for as 
long as have the mangrove forests. "Rollet's (1981) annotated bibliography lists 
5,608 published titles through 1975 with one of the first being the written 
account from the chronicle of Nearchus, dating back to the Greek mariners of 325 
BC." (S. C. Snedaker, University of Miami, Division of Marine Biology and 
Fisheries) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>"One perceives a forest of 
jagged, gnarled trees protruding from the surface of the sea, roots anchored in 
deep, black, foul-smelling mud, verdant crowns arching toward a blazing sun. . . 
. Here is where land and sea intertwine, where the line dividing ocean and 
continent blurs, in this setting the marine biologist and the forest ecologist 
both must work at the extreme reaches of their disciplines" ("Caribbean Mangrove 
Swamps", by Klause Rutzler and Ilka C. Feller, <I>Scientific American</I>, March 
1996, p. 94)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangroves are the 
rainforests by the sea. "The majority of the subtropical and tropical coastline 
is dominated by mangroves, estimated to cover an area of 22 million hectares. 
However, over the past several decades, the global area in mangroves has 
increasingly diminished as a result of a variety of human activities, such as 
overharvesting, freshwater diversion and conversion to other uses." (Snedaker, 
University of Miami, personal correspondence) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangrove forests are 
comprised of taxonomically diverse, salt-tolerant tree and other plant species 
which thrive in intertidal zones of sheltered tropical shores, "overwash" 
islands, and estuaries. Mangrove trees have specially adapted aerial and 
salt-filtering roots and salt-excreting leaves that enable them to occupy the 
saline wetlands where other plant life cannot survive. </FONT></P>

</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangrove forests are vital 
for healthy coastal ecosystems. The forest detritus, consisting mainly of fallen 
leaves and branches from the mangroves, provides nutrients for the marine 
environment and supports immense varieties of sea life in intricate food webs 
associated directly through detritus or indirectly through the planktonic and 
epiphytic algal food chains. (Note: Plankton and benthic algae are primary 
sources of carbon in the mangrove ecosystem, in addition to 
detritus.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The shallow intertidal 
reaches that characterize the mangrove wetlands offer refuge and nursery grounds 
for juvenile fish, crabs, shrimps, and mollusks. Mangroves are also prime 
nesting and migratory sites for hundreds of bird species. In Belize, for 
instance, there are over 500 species of birds recorded in mangrove areas. 
Additionally, manatees, crab-eating monkeys, fishing cats, monitor lizards, sea 
turtles, and mud-skipper fish utilize the mangrove wetlands. </FONT></P>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3><B>The Origin of the 
Species </B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Scientists theorize that 
the earliest mangrove species originated in the Indo-Malayan region. This may 
account for the fact that there are far more mangrove species present in this 
region than anywhere else. Because of their unique floating propagules and 
seeds, certain of these early mangrove species spread westward, borne by ocean 
currents, to India and East Africa, and eastward to the Americas, arriving in 
Central and South America during the upper Cretaceous period and lower Miocene 
epoch, between 66 and 23 million years ago. During that time, mangroves spread 
throughout the Caribbean Sea across an open seaway which once existed where 
Panama lies today. Later, sea currents may have carried mangrove seeds to the 
western coast of Africa and as far south as New Zealand. This might explain why 
the mangroves of West Africa and the Americas contain fewer, but similar 
colonizing species, whereas those of Asia, India, and East Africa contain a much 
fuller range of mangrove species.</FONT></P>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3><B>The Ecology of Mangroves 
</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>These complex ecosystems 
are found between the latitudes of 32 degrees north and 38 degrees south, along 
the tropical coasts of Africa, Australia, Asia, and the Americas. There are 
varying scientific classifications of what constitutes a mangrove plant. 
According to two reputable scientific studies, mangroves include approximately 
16-24 families and 54-75 species (Tomlinson (1986) and Field (1995) 
respectively). The greatest diversity of mangrove species exists in Southeast 
Asia. For example, there are only twelve mangrove species in the New World and 
only four species of mangroves exist along portions of the coasts of the 
southern USA.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangrove forests literally 
live in two worlds at once, acting as the interface between land and sea. 
Mangroves help protect coastlines from erosion, storm damage, and wave action. 
The stability mangroves provide is of immense importance. They prevent shoreline 
erosion by acting as buffers and catch alluvial materials, thus stablizing land 
elevation by sediment accretion that balances sediment loss. Vital coral reefs 
and sea grass beds are also protected from damaging siltation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>A primary factor of the 
natural environment that affects mangroves over the long term is sea level and 
its fluctuations. Other shorter-term factors are air temperature, salinity, 
ocean currents, storms, shore slope, and soil substrate. Most mangroves live on 
muddy soils, but they also grow on sand, peat, and coral rock. If tidal 
conditions are optimal, mangroves can flourish far inland, along the upper 
reaches of coastal estuaries.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangroves vary in height 
according to species and environment, from mere shrubs to 40 meter trees. The 
prop roots of some mangrove species, such as Rhizophora or "red mangrove", and 
the pneumataphores of others, such as Avicennia or "black mangrove", contain 
many small "breathing" pores, called "lenticels." These allow oxygen to diffuse 
into the plant, and down to the underground roots by means of air space tissue 
in the cortex, called "aerenchyma." The lenticels are inactive during high 
tide.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Evolutionary adjustments to 
varying coastal marine environments have produced some astounding biological 
characteristics within mangrove plant communities. Certain species of mangroves 
exclude salt from their systems, others actually excrete the salt they take in 
via their leaves, roots, or branches. In salt excluding mangrove species , the 
mangrove root system is so effective in filtering out salt that a thirsty 
traveler could drink fresh water from a cut root, though the tree itself stands 
in saline soil. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Certain mangrove species 
can propagate successfully in a marine environment because of special 
adaptations. Through "viviparity," embryo germination begins on the tree itself; 
the tree later drops its developed embryos, called seedlings, which may take 
root in the soil beneath. Viviparity may have evolved as an adaptive mechanism 
to prepare the seedlings for long-distance dispersal, and survival and growth 
within a harsh saline environment. During this viviparous development, the 
propagules are nourished on the parent tree, thus accumulating the carbohydrates 
and other compounds required for later autonomous growth. The structural 
complexity achieved by the seedlings at this early stage of plant development 
helps acclimate the seedlings to extreme physical conditions which otherwise 
might preclude normal seed germination. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Another special adaptation 
is the dispersal of certain mangroves' "propagules" which hang from the branches 
of mature trees. These fall off and eventually take root in the soil surrounding 
the parent tree or are carried to distant shorelines. Depending on the species, 
these propagules may float for extended periods, up to a year, and still remain 
viable. Viviparity and the long-lived propagules allow these mangrove species to 
disperse over wide areas.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>"Zonation" often 
characterizes mangrove forests. Certain tree species occupy particular areas, or 
niches, within the ecosystem. Some mangrove species occur close to shore, 
fringing islands and sheltered bays; others are found further inland, in 
estuaries influenced by tidal action.</FONT></P>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3><B>The Importance for Local 
Communities</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Mangrove ecosystems have 
traditionally been sustainably managed by local populations for the production 
of food, medicines, tannins, fuel wood, and construction materials. For millions 
of indigenous coastal residents, mangrove forests offer dependable, basic 
livelihoods and sustain their traditional cultures.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The protective mangrove 
buffer zone helps minimize damage of property and losses of life from hurricanes 
and storms. In regions where these coastal fringe forests have been cleared, 
tremendous problems of erosion and siltation have arisen, and sometimes terrible 
losses to human life and property have occurred due to destructive storms. 
Mangroves have also been useful in treating effluent, as the plants absorb 
excess nitrates and phosphates thereby preventing contamination of nearshore 
waters.</FONT></P>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3><B>The Greatest Threats: an 
Ecosystem in Peril </B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Naturally resilient, 
mangrove forests have withstood severe storms and changing tides for many 
millennia, but they are now being devastated by modern encroachments. Today, 
mangrove forests are among the most threatened habitats in the world -- 
disappearing at an accelerating rate, yet with little public notice. Lenticels 
in the exposed portions of mangrove roots are highly susceptible to clogging by 
crude oil and other pollutants, attacks by parasites, and prolonged flooding 
from artificial dikes or causeways. Over time, environmental stress can kill 
large numbers of mangrove trees. In addition, the charcoal and timber industries 
have also severely impacted mangrove forests, as well as tourism and other 
coastal developments. The rapidly expanding shrimp aquaculture industry poses 
the gravest threat to the world's remaining mangroves. Literally thousands of 
hectares of lush mangrove forests have been cleared to make room for the 
artificial shrimp ponds of this boom and bust industry. This highly volatile 
enterprise has grown exponentially over the last 15 years, leaving devastating 
ruin in its wake. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Until recently, mangrove 
forests have been classified by many governments and industries alike as 
"wastelands", or useless swamps. This erroneous designation has made it easier 
to exploit mangrove forests as cheap and unprotected sources of land and water 
for shrimp farming. The amount of mangrove forest destruction is alarming. 
Thailand has lost more than half of its mangrove forests since 1960. In the 
Philippines, mangroves have declined from an estimated 448,000 hectares in the 
1920s to only 110,000 hectares by 1990. In Ecuador, estimates of mangrove loss 
range from 20% percent to nearly one half of Ecuador's once 362,000 ha. of 
mangrove forested coastline. The Muisne region of Ecuador alone has lost nearly 
90% percent of its mangroves. Globally, as much as 50% percent of mangrove 
destruction in recent years has been due to clear cutting for shrimp 
farms.</FONT></P>
<CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3><B>Towards Solutions: 
Protecting Mangrove Forests</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The failure of national 
governments to adequately regulate the shrimp industry, and the headlong rush of 
multilateral lending agencies to fund aquaculture development without meeting 
their own stated ecological and social criteria, are other important pieces to 
this unfortunate puzzle. The fate of remaining mangrove forests may now rest in 
the hands of the consumers from the wealthy nations that import these luxury 
shrimp products. Since a highly profitable and expanding market is the driving 
force behind the shrimp industry, a worldwide reduction in consumer demand for 
pond-raised shrimp is called for. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Meanwhile, stricter local 
governmental regulations and enforcement protecting mangroves are necessary. 
Also, involvement of local communities in sustainably managing and protecting 
their coastal resource base, including the nearby mangrove forests, is 
essential. </FONT></P>
