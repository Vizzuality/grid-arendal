<P><FONT size=+2>Introduction</FONT> 
<P>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a work in progress. The progress 
toward which it is working is global sustainability -- the integration of local, 
national and regional economic development with protection of the planet's 
environment. That goal is both complex and novel.</P>
<P>There are certainly a number of positive accomplishments. As a grant-giver 
and maker of concessional loans, whose own limited resources leverage roughly 
three times their value, the Facility is expanding the horizons of 
decision-makers in both developing countries and the multilateral development 
agencies to include the major global environment issues as practical and policy 
concerns. As a significant catalyst for partnerships among governments, private 
groups and international institutions, the GEF is creating new coalitions to 
address development and environment and accelerating the transfer of 
environmentally friendly technologies. It has welcomed into its planning and 
operations non-governmental organizations whose concerns and expertise have been 
underappreciated and underutilized. The GEF has also promoted the involvement of 
affected communities in both the planning and the execution of sustainable 
development projects.</P>
<P>It is too early, however, to make a definitive assessment of the impact of 
most of the 220 projects in the GEF work program in terms of their contribution 
to sustainable development as defined at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de 
Janeiro. Nor do the sums of money involved ($1.33 billion in GEF commitments as 
of the end of 1996 along with almost $3.3 billion in cofinancing) match the 
scope of the global challenges to which the GEF gives priority - protecting 
biological diversity and reducing the risks of climate change, for instance. 
Because many GEF projects are without precedent and most require the 
participation of many public and private actors in their design and execution, 
the actual disbursement of funds has often gone slowly. Finally, a gap between 
donor pledges and actual contributions to the GEF is raising concerns regarding 
current planning and questions about burden sharing arrangements in the next 
replenishment of the Facility's funds.</P>
<P>Given these realities, it is most appropriate to view the GEF as a pioneer 
operating on one of the frontiers of sustainable development. By that standard, 
its early performance as an innovator and catalyst has been fruitful, and the 
mechanisms it has developed for cooperative experimentation - especially among 
governments, non-governmental organizations and multilateral development 
agencies - are proving to be effective and flexible, though not always speedy, 
models for decision-making. The track record, however, is short. What it shows 
is the gathering momentum of a fresh force moving in the right direction. The 
body of this report prepared at the request of the Earth Council documents that 
judgment.</P><FONT size=+2>A Unique Entity </FONT>
<P>The Global Environment Facility is a unique international entity. Its 
mission, its governance, its management and its internal procedures represent 
innovative responses to the general spirit and the detailed mandate of the 1992 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, of which the Facility is the only major 
financial accomplishment. </P>
<P></P>
<P>First, its mission. The GEF is the only entity specifically created to foster 
the kinds of local and regional development that will also pay ecological 
dividends for the entire planet. Through grants and low-interest loans to 
developing nations and economies in transition, it helps to fund national, 
regional and global development projects that benefit at least one of four 
central aspects of the world's environment -- climate change, biological 
diversity, the ozone layer and international waters -- as well as local 
economies and societies. No other international entity makes that connection, 
acting locally and globally at the same time. The Facility's contribution, 
however, is limited to covering the additional costs incurred when, for example, 
a country's efforts to promote energy development or the development of natural 
resources also bring additional global environmental benefits. GEF financing 
related to its four focal areas can also support cross-cutting measures against 
land degradation, particularly to combat desertification and the destruction of 
forests.</P>
<P>To guide the evolution of its project portfolio, particularly in the context 
of the priorities and policy guidelines of the Biodiversity and Climate Change 
Conventions, the Facility has adopted an operational strategy for each of its 
focal areas. In biodiversity, the strategy is to address a representative sample 
of ecosystems of global significance. In climate change, the strategy is to 
focus on long-term mitigation measures by (a) removing the barriers to adoption 
of viable climate-friendly technologies and (b) reducing the cost of some of the 
most promising prospective technologies that are not yet viable. In 
international waters, the GEF strategy aims at promoting collaboration in 
addressing priority transboundary concerns, and, on ozone depletion, it is to 
fill crucial gaps in the Montreal Protocol's action plan. </P>
<P>Second, its system of governance is one of a kind. Initially created in 1991 
as an experimental partnership among three international agencies, the GEF was 
restructured, in conformity with the Rio action plan, Agenda 21, to be a 
permanent entity for financing global environmental actions while contributing 
to sustainable development. After negotiations on restructuring concluded in 
March 1994, 34 participating nations - including 13 recipient countries -- 
pledged to contribute $2 billion to the GEF Trust Fund. Since then, the total 
number of GEF members has grown to over 155 countries, whose representatives 
meet in the GEF Assembly of participating states, the GEF's overall supervisory 
body, every three years.</P>
<P>The 32-member GEF Council is the agency's governing body. Convening every six 
months, it both sets general policy and approves "work programs" comprising 
specific project proposals. The day-to-day activity of the independent 
Secretariat involves extensive collaboration with the three institutions - the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank (IBRD) - that are the Facility's 
implementing agencies. The GEF has been designated as the interim financial 
mechanism for both the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. An important component of its work 
consists of enabling activities that assist member countries to fulfill their 
Convention obligations. Reporting formally to its own Assembly and Council, it 
conducts continual consultations with five other bodies: the three multilateral 
agencies who are its executive partners and the Secretariats of the two Rio 
Conventions. (Additionally, in supporting projects to replace ozone-depleting 
technologies in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, the GEF 
works closely with the Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol.) </P>
<P>This exceptionally broad range of cooperative activity sets the Facility 
apart from all other international environmental and development bodies. Its 
scope means that the GEF operates at the center of the multifaceted effort to 
make sustainable development a reality, and the GEF has made considerable 
strides toward bringing global environmental concerns into the mainstream of 
international development activity. But the effort required to sustain its 
partnerships is necessarily time-consuming. Consultation and coordination bring 
important operational benefits, but speed is sometimes sacrificed.</P>
<P>That trade-off has been a conscious one, a corollary to the third unique 
aspect of the GEF's identity: the openness of its management and 
decision-making. Dealing with multiple constituencies - national governments, 
international institutions and private organizations - the Facility has put a 
premium on inclusiveness, consensus and transparency. In the GEF Council, for 
instance, a double weighted majority system of voting gives donor and recipient 
nations equal say. While formal Council decisions are by consensus, were a 
contested resolution actually put to a test, it would require the approval of 
votes representing both 60 percent of all GEF members and 60 percent of total 
contributions.</P>
<P>The Council's rules also provide for invitations to outsiders, NGOs in 
particular, to attend its sessions. That provision - without precedent in other 
international financial institutions - has translated in practice not just to 
attendance but to participation by a number of NGOs at Council sessions. In 
addition to providing written material to GEF members in advance of their 
decisions, NGO representatives have been given the opportunity to speak at the 
meetings on pending questions. Through a regular flow of published project 
documents and quarterly reports on its operations, the GEF also supplies the 
public with a detailed, accessible record of its work and policies and, in 
advance of Council sessions, makes all relevant documents widely available 
through the Internet.</P>
<P>The GEF has found NGO expertise particularly helpful in designing projects 
that fit realities on the ground, and consultations with NGO representatives - 
including day-long reviews in advance of each Council meeting - have built 
working partnerships that translate into more effective GEF investments. NGOs 
are the source of about 20 percent of the actual projects proposed to the 
Facility. Nearly half such ideas (599 in 1994-95) originate with countries 
seeking the Facility's assistance, and approximately one fifth come from the 
GEF's implementing agencies. Of the proposals from non-governmental 
organizations, some of the most noteworthy have arisen under an innovative, 
small ($2,000 to $50,000) grants program administered by UNDP. Lessons learned 
in that small-grants experiment contributed to a GEF Council decision in late 
1996 to adopt a new approach of expedited procedures for handling medium-size 
projects of up to $1 million. It is an innovation built on experience. </P>
<P>Two other special features of the GEF's management approach relate to the 
high standards it demands of the projects it approves and the high priority it 
gives to speedy action. An advisory group, the Scientific and Technical Advisory 
Panel (STAP) under UNEP administration, reviews projects proposed to the GEF to 
insure that they incorporate best-practice precepts and can stand as models of 
imaginative and cost-effective experimentation. If STAP screening serves to 
insure scientifically credible projects, a different GEF mechanism - the Project 
Preparation and Development Facility (PDF) - serves to accelerate their 
evolution. Small but rapid allocations of funds, from a maximum of $25,000 at 
the earliest stage of a project's identification to as much as $1 million for 
detailed technical design of large-scale undertakings, enable the GEF's three 
implementing agencies to move ahead on worthwhile proposals that are on track 
for formal Council approval but have not yet received that final endorsement. 
PDF funds give project developers a small added measure of flexibility, a 
low-cost stimulus to accelerating progress.</P>
<P>Because it is a new entity, working with both United Nations and Bretton 
Woods agencies on a task none had previously faced, the GEF has been obliged to 
experiment. Internally, the emphasis has been on creating new partnerships, 
making the decision-making process an open one and including in it as many 
interested parties as possible. That effort is paying dividends in terms of 
improved project design and execution based on wide advance consultation. It 
carries costs, as well, especially in long lead times between an initial 
proposal and its actual implementation. The GEF has determined, however, that 
careful preparation and, particularly, broad public involvement are crucial 
ingredients for success in realizing global environmental benefits from local 
economic development. The next section of this report examines the way that 
principle has been put into practice and some of the lessons the GEF is learning 
in the process. </P><FONT size=+2>Catalyst for Cooperation</FONT> 
<P>Just as it has pushed for transparency and inclusiveness in its governance 
and management procedures, the GEF has stressed parallel principles in its work 
program. This emphasis on participation is not idealistic; it is a practical 
necessity. Projects that promote global environmental objectives succeed or fail 
at the local level. And to have any realistic chance of success, 
tradition-breaking approaches to natural resource management in developing 
countries must build on community-based partnerships to plan, design and carry 
out the work of change. The GEF acts as a catalyst for such cooperation.</P>
<P>Its operational strategy, therefore, takes as a first principle the 
requirement that projects be country-driven so that national priorities are 
respected and those who are most affected by development - whether the provision 
of clean energy or the sustainable use of forest resources - have a clear stake 
in the outcome of GEF-supported investments. In applying this strategy to real 
situations, the Facility has had to make certain trade-offs. Some developing 
countries, particularly smaller ones, lack the full array of technical and 
managerial resources to see sophisticated projects through from inception to 
completion without some outside help. In some cases, this reality has slowed 
access to funds, a problem which the GEF recognizes and seeks to overcome. Also, 
the widespread need for extra effort to lay the foundation for a project's 
successful design and implementation can mean in practice that funds go to 
preparatory work and capacity-building rather than concrete action. The 
alternative course would produce speedier disbursement of project funds but far 
fewer lasting benefits. The GEF also recognizes that it needs to find new 
avenues to insure that the developing nations' scientists play a greater part in 
identifying and advancing projects and, as appropriate, in participating in 
their implementation. Where country focal points for liaison with the GEF, the 
multilateral development agencies and the Rio conventions are being assigned to 
different government agencies and officials, a frequent result is a lack of 
internal coordination and cohesion another contributing factor to confusion and 
delay.</P>
<P>Given all these concerns it is tempting to believe that development dictated 
from outside and above would be quick and efficient. The GEF, however, has 
learned to look beyond that appearance - a rapid start often leading to an 
unsatisfactory finish - to concentrate its efforts behind country-driven 
projects that rely heavily on stakeholder participation. Progress is not quick, 
but where sufficient investments go into involving local people and building 
capacity to manage local resources, progress can be sustained. Without that 
informed participation, even model ventures can falter and fail. Sustainable 
development also requires supportive national policies, not least a pricing 
framework that reflects the long-term value of natural resources.</P>
<P>In the GEF's experience, community-based non-governmental organizations have 
been among the most effective agents for mobilizing and maintaining grass-roots 
commitment to the kind of experimental undertakings the Facility supports. NGOs 
have participated in projects as large as the world's first attempt to generate 
30 megawatts of power from a biomass integrated gasification/gas turbine in 
Brazil's Northeast Amazon region and as small as the effort on the Caribbean 
island of Tobago to protect vulnerable leatherback turtles when they come ashore 
to lay their eggs. A particularly successful effort to enhance sustainable 
management along Argentina's Patagonian coast has been overseen since 1993 by 
the United Nations Development Programme, using a $2.8 million GEF grant. A UNDP 
report describes the project in greater detail:</P>
<P>"A rich Antarctic Ocean current nourishes the 3,000 km coastline of 
Patagonia, making it the sole breeding ground and habitat for a diverse, yet 
highly interdependent array of life. Its biological resources translate directly 
into employment for most of its human inhabitants: it has the world's fastest 
growing commercial fishery, and wildlife-based tourism has become one of 
Argentina's most important industries. However, without an integrated coastal 
zone management plan for the region, officials are unable to respond to chronic 
oil spills, the spread of untreated sewage and the loss of crucial habitat."</P>
<P>"With the UNDP as its implementing agency, the GEF in 1993 funded the 
initiative of a committed local NGO --Fundacion Patagonia Natural -- to develop 
a comprehensive Patagonian Coastal Zone Management Plan (PCZMP) for the entire 
bioregion. Backed-up by technical support from Wildlife Conservation 
International, this project dedicates over 50% of its budget to local human 
resource development. During the project design stage, a workshop assessed the 
management needs of over 40 officials representing coastal zone governments.... 
Fishermen and eco-tourism service providers participated in stakeholder 
workshops, and public hearings were held to attract community participation in 
developing management recommendations.... [P]rofessionals [being trained under 
the PCZMP] are now filling a newly created institutional framework designed to 
monitor, manage and preserve Patagonian biodiversity. The project's long term 
goal is to incorporate integrated planning by all sectors as the accepted 
approach to resource use...." </P>
<P>"Among its activities the PCZMP sponsors on-board biologist observers who 
work closely with coastal fishermen in assessing unwanted by-catch in South 
Atlantic, a crucial first step toward reducing this wasteful destruction of huge 
numbers of fish and other organisms. Incorporating the concerns of coastal 
fishermen regarding competition from high-seas fisheries, the PCZMP is drawing 
attention to the need to address the effects of high-sea fishing on Patagonian 
biodiversity. By protecting the low-impact coastal fisheries, the PCZMP not only 
provides better protection for the local fishery but has also built good-will 
with the fishermen that led to setting aside new marine protected areas, 
[including the foraging ground] of a penguin colony that is the basis for 
increasingly lucrative tourism."</P>
<P>"A survey of visitors at wildlife reserves has increased the quality of 
reserve management, and hence the value of the tourism sector. The large 
turn-out at a PCZMP sponsored national beach walk to clean the shores made the 
government aware of ... a community [grown] more vocal in demanding protection 
of the coastal environment. The PCZMP has also made coastal communities more 
aware of the need to reduce effluents and the dumping of refuse at sea. Impact 
assessments and community participation are now becoming a familiar part of new 
development initiatives. In spite of a huge increase in the whale-watching 
business, PCZMP meetings with whale-watching firms resulted in a reduction of 
the number of boats around whales at any one time and limited the areas open to 
whale-watching. Since the Patagonian ecosystem extends far out into 
international waters, benefits from this project will have positive effects on 
the health of natural resources throughout the South Atlantic region." </P>
<P>Argentina and many other large, middle-income developing countries have the 
educated personnel, the communications network and the physical infrastructure 
to back up ambitious biodiversity protection projects like the one on 
Patagonia's coast. Smaller GEF partners with more limited income lack some or 
all of those crucial capacities. Nonetheless, they shelter resources that are 
just as valuable to the global environment. To help them with the task of 
protection, the Facility and the UNDP have adopted a flexible strategy of 
supporting small-scale, low-cost ventures - often NGO initiatives - that can lay 
the groundwork for broader efforts and help develop the skills to make larger, 
future investments more feasible. Begun in 1992, this Small Grants Program (SGP) 
is active in 33 countries and aims to include 13 more in 1997. Having already 
awarded funds to some 750 NGOs, the SGP received 565 proposals in the ten months 
from September 1995 to July 1996, approving 134, rejecting 330 and returning the 
remaining ones for revision and reconsideration. Of the successful ideas, nearly 
two-thirds addressed biodiversity protection goals, such as the ones pursued 
since mid-1993 under a $50,000 grant described in the following UNDP report on 
raising butterflies to conserve critical forest habitat in Kenya:</P>
<P>"Kenya's Arabuko-Sokoke forest is the largest block of natural coastal forest 
remaining in East Africa. According to the East Africa Natural History Society, 
it is the most important tract of land for biodiversity conservation in Kenya. 
It is home to at least six species of endangered birds and to a number of 
endemic animal species that exist nowhere else in the world. Rare plants, 
butterflies, reptiles and amphibians abound in Arabuko-Sokoke as well....Yet 
until recently, the 84,000 people who live in or near the forest did not 
appreciate its value as a resource of local and global significance because they 
did not benefit from its presence. Indeed, poverty among these people is acute. 
When polled, 53 percent of those interviewed said they thought the forest should 
be cleared for farming." </P>
<P>"In June 1993, an NGO formed by the Kenya Museums Society and the East 
African Natural History Society received a grant of $50,000 from the GEF Small 
Grants Program to launch a project that would help meet the immediate need of 
the local people for income, while at the same time motivating them to view the 
forest as a precious resource which it is in their interest to protect. Such a 
project also meets two of the GEF's key criteria for operation: to conserve 
biodiversity and to combat global warming which is associated with the 
destruction of forests. The key player in the Kipepeo Project scheme is one of 
the forest's most delicate, elegant and elusive inhabitants: the swallowtail 
butterfly. In order to demonstrate that biodiversity can be conserved when 
natural habitats are used sustainably - and profitably - by local communities, 
the project began providing local farmers with extension training in the rearing 
of butterfly pupae for export." </P>
<P>"Other activities carried out in connection with this effort to combat 
poverty while conserving biodiversity included the construction of a flight cage 
and breeding shed, the establishment of a foodplant nursery and research into 
butterfly inventories, seasonality, rearing techniques, and the foodplant 
requirements of selected species. To ensure the economic viability of the 
scheme, overseas markets were identified, export procedures were set up and a 
business plan was developed to ensure sustainability. Tangible results were 
produced within a year. More than 130 households took part in the project as 
compared to the 50 anticipated. Villagers living on the edge of the forest 
learned how to rear forest butterflies using leaves from forest trees for food, 
and were paid one dollar for every healthy butterfly pupa they produced. In 
1994, the Kipepeo Project exported more than 10,000 butterfly pupae, netting 
nearly $16,000 in export earnings. About one third of these pupae were produced 
by villagers, who earned approximately $4,200 from their sale...."</P>
<P>Three other small grants, totaling less than $38,000, have underwritten 
efforts in villages of the Dominican Republic to expand the use of solar energy, 
not only providing credit for the purchase and installation of solar 
photovoltaic panels for some 300 families within the first year of the project 
but also helping to establish three new small businesses and strengthen ten 
others whose 27 technicians are now able to install solar PV systems in 21 
provinces. Each such system is estimated to displace between three and five 
metric tons of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. As a UNDP assessment 
reports, "six NGOs also received technical assistance in solar PV installation 
and maintenance, and two of these received financial support to enable them to 
purchase equipment and establish revolving funds to enable families to acquire 
photovoltaic systems on credit. And perhaps most significant in the long term is 
the expanded acceptance by a wide range of rural Dominicans of solar energy as a 
viable, affordable, environmentally friendly source of electricity."</P>
<P>What has worked on the island of Hispaniola is to be tried - but on a far 
larger scale - in the island nation of Indonesia, where the GEF and World Bank 
have readied a $74.3 million dollar solar electrification project to bring some 
200,000 home systems to rural communities in four regions. In this case, a GEF 
grant of $24.3 million is the catalyst for $37.5 million in World Bank funding, 
with the remaining co-financing to come from Indonesian sources. Another World 
Bank loan of $150 million to Indonesia is to be linked to a $6-million GEF grant 
in support of efforts to spur private energy suppliers to use small-scale 
renewable power generation from biomass, hydroelectric and thermal sources to 
supply rural customers. Like the small Dominican Republic grants, these 
GEF-supported projects in Indonesia aim to stimulate private activities, 
including those of NGOs and cooperatives, that will both further economic 
development and mitigate global climate change.</P>
<P>Mini-investments, such as those in the Small Grants Programme, can bring 
quick returns and spur community involvement. But as their scale is limited, so 
is their impact, and the GEF has determined to incorporate the speed and 
flexibility of the SGP into a streamlined set of procedures for handling 
medium-sized projects in which GEF financing will be $1 million or less. The 
goal is to cut preparation time for project proposals to no more than three 
months and to expedite review by the GEF and the project's implementing agency 
to maximum of 25 days.<BR>This new approach - responding both to experience and 
to the urgency for action on the Rio agenda - exemplifies the GEF's readiness to 
innovate and, by its catalytic example, to stimulate change in the ways its 
partners also address the challenges of sustainable development. The next 
section of the report looks at those partnerships, especially with the GEF's 
implementing agencies. 
<P><FONT size=+2>Unlimited Partnerships</FONT> 
<P>Whether in concert with local communities or a government ministry or an 
international body, the GEF is always a partner (and rarely the senior one) in 
coalitions to advance sustainable development. Its influence depends on its 
ability to mobilize others, but while the Facility's financial resources can 
stimulate collaboration, they are too limited to determine its outcome. The key 
factor, instead, is the ability to harmonize diverse skills and interests within 
an agreed agenda for action. Since the GEF's agenda of <EM>global</EM> 
environmental protection poses very new challenges to developing nations and 
multilateral institutions, it has taken time to forge effective partnerships at 
various levels. The record is encouraging but far from complete.</P>
<P>In intensive consultation with the two Rio Conventions, for which it acts as 
the interim financial mechanism, for instance, the Facility has been able to 
contribute to the search for a practical global consensus on priorities for 
action in reducing the risks of climate change and expanding the protection of 
biological resources. Predictably, the process of developing operational 
modalities from the guidance of the Conferences of the Parties to the 
Conventions is not simple or straightforward. The GEF's relations with the two 
Conventions, however, are evolving positively. Regular consultations among 
Secretariats' staff and the presence of representatives from the Conventions' 
Secretariats on the GEF's Operations Committee, facilitate the sharing of 
information and views about projects under active consideration and their 
eligibilities.</P>
<P>Some of those projects have moved rapidly; others have not. Among the success 
stories is a 1993 GEF climate-change grant of $3.3 million to install wind 
turbines in Costa Rica to generate power that would otherwise have been provided 
by thermal plants. It has not only leveraged $24.1 million in private 
co-investments but opened the way to a broad increase in the country's use of 
wind as a source of electricity. Similarly, energy-efficiency projects in 
Thailand and Mexico have moved quickly - though along different lines - toward 
greenhouse-gas-reduction goals. By contrast, a plan that was approved in 1992 to 
introduce sustainable forestry management in Guyana's virgin Iwokrama rain 
forest has had to wait on the resolution of a prolonged policy debate in that 
nation's legislature over competing visions of the economic value of timber 
reserves. The legal framework for environmentally sound forestry practices is 
now in place - an example of the progress that GEF intervention can stimulate - 
but the project itself is far behind schedule. </P>
<P>In general, developing countries have tended to respond positively to ideas 
for abating the dangers of global climate change through experimental efforts at 
the local level to enhance energy efficiency or develop power from alternative 
and renewable sources. One attraction of such endeavors is that, while not 
cost-free, they often come in the form of new, outside investments. Efforts to 
protect biodiversity, on the other hand, may well involve at least short-term 
reductions in much-needed earnings from forests or fisheries or other 
exploitable natural resources. Making the case for long-term, sustainable 
management in the interest of local economic growth as well as global 
environmental objectives requires sophisticated and persistent effort. It is not 
a task that the GEF can accomplish alone.</P>
<P>The projects are the testing ground for the GEF's basic operational 
partnerships, its collaboration with the three implementing agencies who oversee 
and often also underwrite the execution of GEF grants and loans. Each of the 
agencies has its own strong institutional assets to bring to the work of 
environmental protection, but none of them - until the GEF came into being - had 
an ally committed to advancing global goals and making them <EM>mainstream</EM> 
priorities for concerted effort. Opening new avenues for action, the GEF has 
helped each of its partners rethink its role in terms of the global 
environmental agenda and has joined them in adapting to the new challenges. In 
turn, as participants in GEF planning and in development of its projects, the 
implementing agencies help the GEF put its mission into the context of other 
global concerns - the fight against poverty above all - that relate to 
environmental degradation. </P>
<P>With the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the smallest and 
youngest of the three agencies but the only one with a specifically 
environmental mandate, the GEF has collaborated primarily in the field of 
biodiversity protection and specifically in projects to gather the scientific 
data needed to assess both world-wide knowledge on the subject and 
country-by-country data on resources and strategies for their conservation and 
sustainable use. The Global Biodiversity Assessment had, as well, the effect of 
strengthening links among the world's scientists and mobilizing the scientific 
community worldwide in support of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. 
With the participation of a number of private international research 
organizations, the GEF/UNEP effort has committed over $12 million to assembling 
and analyzing information needed for practical progress under the Convention on 
Biological Diversity. In the realm of climate change, UNEP has also supported 
nine studies in countries as diverse as Venezuela, Poland, Morocco and Tanzania 
as part of an effort to create inventories of both greenhouse gases and the 
sinks that can absorb them. The results have provided the standard methodology 
for such inventories and the basic building blocks for future GEF projects to 
assist countries in controlling greenhouse-gas emissions, and the studies helped 
to form an NGO network that participated in designing guidelines for the 
national inventories.</P>
<P>In its work with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
Facility has helped to launch the innovative projects described above in 
Argentina, Kenya, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. Beyond its role in 
administering the ground-breaking Small Grants Program, the UNDP has proved a 
particularly valuable intermediary with non-governmental organizations, 
recruiting NGO participants for 104 projects as of April 1996. It put the dollar 
value of those private services at $47.8 million - out of total GEF allocations 
of $288 million - including $2.3 million for the work of five NGOs in the 
Patagonian Coastal Zone Management Plan and $779,000 for the participation of 13 
European groups in a regional monitoring and analysis program to compile the 
data needed for action to manage and clean up pollution in the Danube River 
Basin. As a development agency with extensive contacts with government officials 
as well, the UNDP supplements the Facility's concern for environmental issues 
with an understanding of the political and economic dynamics of countries where 
developmental and ecological objectives need to be pursued together.</P>
<P>Of the GEF implementing agencies, the World Bank (IBRD) has the largest 
financial resources, the longest record of involvement in the developing world 
and deep reserves of technical knowledge and analytical capacity. A partnership 
between a large, mature organization and a small, young one would seem a 
predestined mismatch, but the GEF, as a source even of very limited funds, has 
proved to have a positive synergy with Bank lending for projects incorporating 
global environmental goals. A Bank working paper on climate change noted in 
March, 1995, for instance, that the IBRD had launched its own "Solar Initiative" 
as an "organizing force... for the identification of opportunities to finance 
renewable energy applications with Bank and GEF resources. For some 
renewable-energy technology, the report added, "GEF-funded projects are not only 
the testing grounds... but also the first demonstration of their applicability 
on a commercial basis." </P>
<P>The experiment mentioned earlier with a biomass integrated gasifier/gas 
turbine in Brazil is only one of nine, large-scale renewable energy initiatives 
which the Bank and the GEF have joined to support. In most of them, a single GEF 
dollar has leveraged more than three dollars of Bank lending. A huge investment 
in developing geothermal energy in the Philippines matches $30 million in GEF 
support with more than $1.3 billion from the Bank and other investors. On a 
smaller scale and still in early stages of development is a GEF/World Bank 
effort to draw private investment into the work of sustainable development, 
especially in the areas of climate change and biodiversity protection. 
Initiatives pursued in partnership with the Bank's private-sector arm, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), include a Biodiversity Enterprise Fund 
for Latin America to invest in forestry, agriculture and ecotourism, a Small and 
Medium Scale Enterprise Program that channels GEF funds through financial 
intermediaries to private enterprises engaged in renewable and energy efficiency 
projects and in sustainable forestry and agriculture. Additionally a Renewable 
Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund would channel concessional finance to buy down 
the development costs and risks for smaller and innovative projects in these 
areas. The private sector is an asset that the GEF and World Bank together seek 
to mobilize both as a source of co-financing and as a channel for technology 
transfer.</P>
<P>While the Bank's concessional loan arm, the International Development Agency, 
and the GEF are equal financial participants ($35 million each) in a joint 
effort with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to improve the environmental management 
of Lake Victoria, this international waters project is a good example of the way 
the Bank Group's multifaceted expertise, with GEF stimulus, can be brought to 
bear on ecological threats to economic development. Over-fishing and various 
forms of pollution are endangering not only 200 indigenous species in Lake 
Victoria but the livelihood of an estimated 25 million people in the three 
countries that adjoin it. The five-year project seeks to make a start on what 
will have to be a longer term effort at waste and wetlands management in 14 
pilot zones, fisheries management on a regional scale, extensive research and 
even contingency planning for pollution disasters. The challenge of bringing 
three governments together, drawing up detailed investment plans, overseeing 
their implementation and assessing the results as basis for further effort is 
vast in scope. The World Bank, in different settings, has gained the knowledge 
needed for such an undertaking. In partnership with the GEF, it is addressing 
its experience and resources to the global environmental agenda.</P><FONT 
size=+2>Conclusions and Recommendations</FONT> 
<P>The preceding pages of this report to the Earth Council have described the 
beginnings of the Global Environment Facility, the innovations it has attempted, 
the partnerships it is forging and a few of the operations that it is helping 
countries around the world to conduct in furtherance of Agenda 21. The emphasis 
of the GEF's brief history has been on experimentation, on learning from 
experience and maintaining the flexibility to adapt to realities on the ground 
and in the complex international setting of a global effort. A monitoring and 
evaluation (M&amp;E) system has been put in place to insure that the experiences 
and lessons learned are continuously being analysed and incorporated into future 
planning, design and implementation of GEF activities.</P>
<P>The first years have been hopeful, but they have also been sobering. In 
concluding this progress report, it is important to underline the constraints 
that face not only the GEF but all those who are committed to insuring that the 
spirit of Rio be translated into tangible achievement.</P>
<P>The spirit of Rio is not unchallenged. The changes set in motion there are 
neither automatic nor unopposed. The momentum behind global environmental 
progress meets constant resistance from other powerful forces -- among them 
rising population and persistent poverty, certain patterns of production and 
consumption, rapid urbanization and the abiding human temptation in all nations 
to sacrifice long-term interests to short-term needs. It is too early to predict 
the outcome of a contest that did not begin at the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development and that will not end in five more years or even 
fifty. It is essential to recognize, above all, that the contest is very much 
underway. Considering that nothing less is at stake than the future of the 
planet and its inhabitants, it is also necessary constantly to examine our 
strategy for environmental security for flaws to correct and strengths to 
exploit.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A crucial reality to acknowledge is the overall stagnation -- even the 
decline -- of support from governments and multilateral institutions for 
development financing of all kinds. As a percentage of donor countries' GNP, 
official development assistance in 1995 stood at 0.29 percent, its lowest level 
since 1973. In dollar terms, the flow of these public resources dropped almost 
ten percent in a single year, from $60.8 billion in 1992 to $54.8 billion in 
1993. The total rose again in 1994 to roughly $60 billion, but it remains lower 
than in the past.</P>
<P>Equally important to external finance is the slow-moving effort to reform 
economic and development policies that abet, not restrain, air and water 
pollution, land degradation and natural resource exhaustion. Many of those 
policies are the reflections of distorted markets. To take just one example, 
energy subsidies in developing countries amount to some $200 billion annually. 
Inefficient water supply agencies are estimated to be costing $1.5 billion a 
year in revenues in Latin America alone. Tariffs for electricity and water that 
reflected real production costs would bring a double harvest of benefits. First, 
some of the new revenues could certainly be invested in human resources to 
improve nutrition, education and health and to restrain population growth. 
Second, realistic costs that cut the waste of fuel and water would further 
enhance sustainability. Valuable in themselves, such reforms have added, 
important environmental value.</P>
<P>Another instance of assets wasted is the undervaluation of forest resources, 
part of the policy problem faced by Guyana in the biodiversity protection 
project mentioned earlier. Although it is hard to put a definitive price tag on 
yearly losses, it is clear that market-based pricing of timber and other 
agricultural products -- along with strengthened land tenure policies -- would 
give foresters and farmers the incentives they now lack to increase productivity 
while reducing pressure on natural habitat and threats to biodiversity.</P>
<P>Such reforms can pay for themselves many times over in environmental and 
development dividends. Without them, financing, whatever its source, will not be 
effective in advancing sustainable development. But in the proper policy 
setting, even the private financing that is now the main outside resource for 
most developing countries in Asia can be steered toward environmentally positive 
and enduring growth.</P>
<P>Establishing that proper setting is one of the goals - and one of the higher 
hurdles - of every significant GEF-backed project. To the extent that GEF 
involvement moves recipient countries to face and to resolve the policy choices 
that underpin sustainable development, even the limited resources the Facility 
has at its disposal can produce far-reaching and long-lasting results. When 
those resources were set in 1994 at $2 billion, donor countries pledged to 
provide their full contributions within four years. Regrettably, that schedule 
is not being kept by some. </P>
<P>The gap between the pledges of 1994 and performance as of 1997 is worrisome. 
It handicaps the Facility's long-range planning and its ability to encourage 
project pipeline development. It also impedes a smooth process for replenishing 
the GEF Trust Fund which is due to begin in the spring of 1997. Most of all, 
unlike official development assistance, actions for global environmental 
improvement can only succeed if pursued as a cooperative international effort, 
particularly between North and South. The North cannot by itself mitigate such 
threats as global warming, any more than the South -- acting alone -- can make 
sustainable economic development a reality. </P>
<P>On the fifth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development, it is essential, therefore, to renew the Rio commitments and to 
redouble the collective effort to find and to maintain a dynamic balance between 
human needs and nature's resources, a sustainable course of development that 
promotes security among nations and for the planetary environment.</P>
