<P align=center>Is There An Economic Recovery In Sub-Saharan Africa?</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>by</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>Callisto Madavo and Jean-Louis Sarbib</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=justify></B>It was not so long ago that economic writing on Africa 
tended to be uniformly gray, foreboding, and even marked by despair, a suitable 
accompaniment to the pervasive television images of civil war, famine, and 
assorted crises in the Continent.<SUP> </SUP>Some of this persists. Recent 
strife in disparate parts of Africa--Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, the Horn of Africa--suggests that Africa’s fundamental 
instabilities remain. However, messages of an altogether different nature have 
begun to appear on the economic front over the past three years. Initially, the 
positive sentiments about Africa were muted, even tentative. This was 
understandable. Too often in the past had hopes of an African upturn been dashed 
by events, either unfavorable developments in the international economy, or 
regional cataclysms resulting from natural or man-made crises.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Lately, judgments about the economic performance of African 
countries have become less speculative. They are based on a pattern of solidity 
in several countries that is undeniable, even if it remains fragile, and has not 
been witnessed in the Continent in over two decades. Moreover, several new 
linkups between leading industrialized and African countries are in the works. 
They are based on trade and investment, rather than focused entirely on aid to 
Africa, as in the past. This gives implicit recognition to the fact that several 
African countries are ready for relationships based on greater equality between 
the two groups. All of this comes at a time when favorable political transitions 
have taken place in Africa. Perhaps the most important change is the fact that 
in 36 of 48 countries, the government of the day has come to power through 
multi-party elections, a sharp contrast to the situation as late as 1990, when 
only 6 of the region’s governments were elected. It is significant that the 
countries that have made the greatest progress in terms of political rights and 
civil participation during the 1990s have also done best on economic 
management.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>In this brief review, we will examine whether the changing 
opinion on Africa is justified, and comment on elements that offer hope and 
those that remain a cause for concern.</P><B>

      <LI>Why is news of an African recovery important?</LI></OL></OL></OL></B>
<P align=justify>Africa is the most important development challenge of the 21st 
century. In many respects, there has been significant progress––for example, 
life expectancy in some countries has risen by more than 20 years. But, even 
these gains are threatened by the scourge of HIV/AIDS, which is expected to 
reduce life expectancy in some countries (e.g., Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe) by 
as much as 10-17 years. For the most part, the Continent faces a formidable task 
in attempting to reach parity on economic welfare and social inclusion with the 
leading developing regions of the world (see Table 1).</P>

<P align=justify>a</U>/ <I>World Development Indicators: 1998</I>, World Bank; 
data refer to latest year.</P><I>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Adjusted for differences in purchasing power</I>, in 1997 the 
average income of the poorest developing countries, worldwide, was $3,230. In 
Africa, incomes range from $510 in Ethiopia and Sierra Leone (the lowest in the 
world) to $9,360 in Mauritius (close to those of Argentina and Saudi Arabia). 
But the incidence of poverty is higher in most African countries than elsewhere 
in the developing world.</P><I>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>The reduction of poverty, through the creation of permanent, 
productive employment, is the highest priority in Africa</I>. It is estimated 
that about half of all Africans will live in absolute income poverty when the 
millennium ends about 18 months from now. The probability of being income poor 
is highest among those who live in countries growing slower than 5 percent per 
year in real terms, in rural areas, in large households or (in several 
countries) in households headed by women, and among those who have low 
educational attainment.</P>
<P align=justify>Other measures of poverty are equally disturbing. With low 
economic growth, a rate of population increase that is the highest in the world 
(2.8 percent per year), and a high burden of dependents to workers, the pressure 
on resources to ameliorate the condition of the poor has been excessive. As a 
result, Africa ranks low in terms of the most critical indicators of social 
progress––how long people live, how much knowledge they acquire, and their 
access to the resources needed for a decent standard of living. The pace of 
improvement is also much slower than in other developing regions. Further, 
despite recent increases in real incomes in most countries, inequality in the 
distribution of these incomes remains unacceptably high, and although the data 
are sketchy, seems to have risen since the 1980s. This is disturbing not only 
because large income inequalities often explain poor economic performance, they 
are also a central factor in social and political instability.</P>
<P align=justify>Given this background, it is evident why good news from Africa 
is important not only to the people of the region, but to all development 
practitioners. The need for a strongly positive performance is urgent because, 
since World War II, except for the countries in Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union, no developing region of the world has seen such widespread and 
persistence economic stagnation as Africa in the 1980s ("the lost decade"). 
After rising at an average rate of 4.1 percent per year during 1965-1980, the 
growth rate plummeted to 2.3 percent per year for the next decade, below the 
rate of increase in population. In 28 (of 47) countries, per capita income 
started declining during the 1980s. In fact, 21 countries had lower incomes per 
head of their population in 1990 than in 1980.</P><B>
<P align=justify>Is There An African Recovery?</P></B>
<P align=justify>Analysts who study the level and fluctuations of economic 
activity have well-defined criteria for identifying recoveries. The benchmarks 
are usually ascertained from short-period data, for example quarterly time 
series. They juxtapose leading, coincidental and lagging indicators of economic 
performance that are correlated with expansions or declines in economic output 
and employment.</P>
<P align=justify>Unfortunately, no such methodology exists for identifying 
changes in economic cycles in African countries, not least because the data are 
weak. In many countries, the year-to-year variation in economic performance is 
large enough to impair our ability to identify stable economic relationships 
from published statistics alone. Here, our examination of whether there is a 
recovery is, therefore, focused on three nodes. <I>First</I>, we examine 
conjunctural changes in economic variables, and speculate about their 
implications on the basis of "priors"--knowledge of what holds in similar 
economic systems. <I>Second</I>, we examine changes in policy regimes and 
decision making processes, and draw out the possible implications. 
<I>Finally</I>, we assess whether the recent changes are significant enough that 
the fundamental obstacles to the growth of African countries have been removed. 
</P><B>
<P align=justify>Indicators</B>. The recent economic performance of most African 
countries has been encouraging. Figure 1 attempts to capture the general trend 
in terms of an "economic cycle." There are noticeably more countries on the 
ascending part of the cycle, implying that performance during 1994-97 was better 
than during 1991-93, than on the descending portion. After a decade of declining 
or stagnant incomes, 34 countries recorded increases in <I>income per head</I> 
during 1994-97, and 18 countries were able to grow at <I>aggregate rates</I> 
above the 5 percent per year anti-poverty threshold mentioned above. Figure 2 
elaborates on this, showing the number of countries where income per head has 
been rising. </P>
<P align=justify>However, this improved performance is not yet as spectacular, 
nor of as long a duration, as several other post-1960 economic expansions. Our 
examination of the data on growth trends and turnarounds in Africa is sobering. 
Eleven countries in the region were able to maintain average growth rates of 
above 6 percent per year for at least a 10-year period; nineteen countries were 
able to reach and maintain growth rates higher than the 4.6 percent recorded 
during 1997. In general, therefore, growth rates significantly higher than the 
recent ones are possible. In fact, just four countries--Angola, Central African 
Republic, Guinea and Namibia--have never reached sustained growth rates of above 
5 percent per year.</P>
<P align=justify>Growth acceleration indicators--which show how fast turnarounds 
can occur--are equally instructive. Several countries have been able to raise 
their growth rates from one year to the next by as much as 3-4 percentage 
points, and then to sustain the higher </P><FONT size=2>

<P align=justify>growth rates, or continue accelerating, over a period of years. 
Most frequently, however, growth rate accelerations of 2 percentage points per 
year seem to be the norm. By these standards, the recent (post-1994) 
acceleration in African trend growth rates is modest indeed, for most countries 
in the range of 0.5 percentage points per year.</P>
<P align=justify>Other indicators of economic performance support our reading 
that economic performance is noticeably better, but not yet self-sustaining or 
generalized enough to warrant excessive optimism. The median rate of inflation, 
as measured by the GDP deflator, has fallen to 9.7 percent, compared to above 11 
percent during much of the 1980s and early part of this decade. However, there 
are still large differences among the </P>
<P align=center><IMG height=420 src="Geo-2-286_files/image10.gif" width=575></P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=justify>countries of the region. At one extreme are countries such as 
those in the CFA zone that have reverted to their historically low rates of 
below 5 percent per year. At the other are countries afflicted by recent 
conflicts or other forms of social and political instability, where inflation 
rates could run significantly above 50 percent per year. External aid has played 
an important role in moderating inflationary demands that could emanate from 
public budget deficits. Nevertheless, the overall picture that emerges is that 
most African countries have now acquired the macroeconomic skills and discipline 
to bring inflation down to levels that are no longer as punishing as in the 
past. </P>
<P align=justify>The situation with regard to international reserves, an 
indicator of the ability of countries to be able to withstand economic shocks, 
is not as good. Traditionally, most African countries have targeted three months 
of import cover to be the desirable level of international reserves. Even by 
this standard, nearly half the countries are extremely vulnerable to shocks, 
with several hanging on with just a few weeks of cover. If, as it is sometimes 
argued, the commodity dependent countries of Africa should hold even higher 
stocks of reserves than other developing countries, the risks from the current 
low levels of reserves are perilous for most of the continent. A global slump 
during 1998 and 1999, perhaps longer, is a plausible outcome. There is cause for 
concern about the sustainability of the current growth rates of income in Africa 
which, as described below, have resulted partly from rising global demand for 
African exports. At best, external deficits as a share of total output will 
remain unchanged; it is more likely they will expand as countries struggle to 
maintain imports at the present level, even if import prices fall. The adequacy 
of international reserves will prove to be critical.</P><B>
<P align=justify>Policies.</B> There is heartening evidence to suggest that the 
recent growth spurt goes beyond merely reflecting the improved world economy. It 
is also a product of good policies, especially in macroeconomic management and 
in core areas of resource use in the economy. In the past, excluding the period 
of import-substituting growth witnessed in many countries in the 1960s and 1970s 
that proved to be unsustainable, growth accelerations in African countries have 
reflected improved commodity prices or, more broadly, improved terms of trade. 
While in the aggregate terms of trade continued to exercise some influence over 
the 1994-97 growth rate, but <I>negatively</I>, both increases in developed 
country demand for Africa’s exports and improved domestic policies had strong 
positive effects. By far the strongest explanatory factor seems to be the 
latter.</P>
<P align=justify>The relationship in recent years between good policies and 
higher growth is shown graphically in Figure 3. The 44 African countries for 
which detailed information is available were evaluated by using three criteria: 
the existence of social stability, which is considered essential for economywide 
productive activity; satisfactory macroeconomic policies, which help avoid 
payments crisis and provide a stable environment for rational resource 
allocation; and a basic level of efficiency in core areas of resource 
allocation, which is necessary to support economic growth.</P>
<P align=justify>As shown, there is an unmistakable positive relationship. The 
importance of social stability is undoubted. It is for this reason that we find 
worrisome some recent events that have seen several countries sucked into civil 
and military strife. Of the 37 countries (with an average annual growth rate of 
4.4 percent during the past three years) that were able to provide social 
stability, the 30 that cleared the macroeconomic policy threshold were able to 
obtain a higher payoff in terms of growth (average of 5.1 percent per year). 
Moreover, of this group, the 21 countries that were also able to achieve a basic 
level of resource allocation efficiency grew even faster, at 5.5 percent per 
year.</P>
<P align=justify>The specifics of this relationship bear examination. There is 
an unambiguous (and for the "working" economies a fairly smooth) relationship 
between policy performance and policy outcomes, especially in areas where 
quantitative measurement is possible. The overall fiscal deficit tends to be 
smaller in the representative "better performing" country (below 5 percent of 
GDP, compared to about 9 percent for the rest); the external current account 
balance is also lower (about 7 percent of GDP, compared to about 14 percent for 
the weaker performers); and net private capital inflows to the better performers 
reached 1.4 percent of GDP in 1997, compared to 0.4 percent for the 
representative weak performer. In sum, while domestic demand was being 
restrained, increased external demand coupled with policy-induced increases in 
the efficiency and volume of domestic supply have accounted for the improved 
growth performance that we have seen during 1994-97. A similar, but weaker, 
relationship between policy and performance can be seen when other measurable 
factors such as inflation and investment efficiency, are examined; however, the 
time period is too short in each of these cases to entirely disentangle trends 
from special situations. </P>
<P align=justify>Besides demonstrating that economic policies matter for growth, 
the results described above are also the bedrock upon which we could base 
optimism about African economic prospects. For, in many cases, several African 
countries are adopting economic policies that are reshaping the micro-structures 
of their economies in fundamentally liberal ways and in concert with, rather 
than against, the forces of globalization that are so powerful today.</P>
<P align=justify>For example, all African governments are less interventionist 
today in production and marketing than during the past two decades. Inefficient 
public sector or quasi-public marketing boards, be they in agriculture, 
manufacturing or services, have been largely abolished or commercialized. In 
cases where they continue to exist, as for example in the markets for some of 
West Africa’s main export crops, considerable flexibility and partial 
delicensing have been introduced into their operations, and all indicators point 
towards even greater liberalization. Further, all African economies are less 
protectionist today than, say, in 1990. In many cases restrictions on trade have 
been reduced to levels comparable to those found in the more liberal developing 
countries. Price distortions are much lower, too. Real interest rates, although 
at extremely high and punishing levels in some countries--due mainly to 
excessive government borrowing--are generally market demand-driven, and the 
volume of credit flowing at rigid and market-distorting rates (including to the 
public sector) is down sharply. Real exchange rates are more competitive than in 
1990, especially for the CFA zone countries, which have been able to hold on to 
most of the gains from the 1994 devaluation. With the exception of the CFA zone, 
most foreign exchange regimes are market-based today; access to foreign exchange 
has been almost universally broadened, as has retention of foreign exchange by 
exporters and other recipients. As a result, the black market premium in foreign 
exchange markets, for the representative country, was below 5 percent in 1997, 
compared to 45 percent as late as 1991.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Obstacles.</B> Africa’s economic endowments are well 
known--rich and relatively unexploited natural resources; weak states and 
institutions and corruption; inadequate strategic, functional and technical 
management skills; low efficiency of investment; high costs of transportation 
and communication; and prevalence of serious health and nutritional 
deficiencies. The contribution of each of these factors to African performance 
and prospects has been described extensively in recent popular and technical 
writings. So have some of the potential solutions--foreign investment to 
jump-start resource based industrialization, capacity building, investments in 
human and physical infrastructure, promotion of regional integration, and the 
like.</P>
<P align=justify>We do not deny the importance of these factors, nor some of the 
solutions proffered, when we point out that, together, they add up to a vast, 
financially costly and institutionally demanding agenda of actions for the 
continent. In an environment of constrained funding and capacity, there is need 
for selectivity in what is attempted to sustain African development. For our 
purposes, and within the limits of the subject discussed in this review, it is 
sufficient to note that economic policies have and will continue to play a 
critical role in the African revival. The challenge is to pace and sequence 
policy reforms. On the one hand, liberal market reforms, if pursued with vigor 
and extended to cover corruption and core areas of economic activity, should 
forestall the emergence of the kinds of microeconomic and incentive problems 
that recently have compounded the economic woes of the East Asian countries, 
including Japan. On the other, there is need to pursue liberal markets in a 
measured manner, ensuring that supply and management capacities are enhanced 
adequately to help countries, and firms and farms within them, to manage higher 
volatility (even if only during a transitional phase) and to deal with increased 
competition. Among the areas where this is especially true are the financial 
sector, public enterprise reform, and the management of capital flows. </P><B>
<P align=justify></B>Over the medium and long term, one of the keys to 
sustaining improvements in supply and enhancements in management capacities is 
investment, both in physical infrastructure and in human resources. On both 
fronts, there is cause for concern. </P>
<P align=justify>Unfortunately, high levels of instability––economic, social and 
political––are a characteristic of many countries in the region, making them 
high risk environments in which to stimulate more rapid economic development. 
The risk associated with "doing business" in Africa applies equally to private 
investors, who put their own resources on the line, and external donors, who are 
held accountable by their constituencies for the use of resources by recipient 
countries.</P>
<P align=justify>Recent economic policies have yielded improvements in 
efficiency, no doubt, but it is unlikely that they can be sustained without 
massive increases in investment. Overall, the amount of output extracted from 
existing investment levels has risen nearly threefold during 1994-97 compared to 
1991-93, which is a praiseworthy achievement by any standard. However, at the 
economywide level investment efficiency is still only half that in East and 
South Asia, although ahead of the levels achieved by Latin America and the 
Caribbean countries. An alternative way of evaluating the data, which tries to 
explain whether increase in growth have resulted from employing more workers, 
more capital, or higher efficiency, yields equally interesting results. Total 
factor productivity growth, as a measure of the efficiency of resource use in an 
economy, has been low or negative for most African countries for which such 
calculations can be made. This is disquieting, and possibly reflects low levels 
of technology, poor organization of production and marketing, inadequate 
specialization, and similar factors that affect the efficiency of resource 
use.</P>
<P align=justify>The information at hand suggests that, despite the recent 
increase in investment efficiency, over the long haul capital accumulation has 
played by far the greatest role in raising output. Unfortunately, increasing aid 
dependency suggests that, while faster capital accumulation is essential in 
Africa, present trends are not sustainable. Over the medium and long term, 
higher domestic investment can only be financed if the contribution of domestic 
sources increases, or larger private capital inflows are available, and are not 
viable unless gains in efficiency are enhanced.</P>
<P align=justify>Most African countries have been unsuccessful in generating 
private investment, either domestic or foreign, and the $11 billion in net 
private flows (lending and direct/portfolio investment) received in 1997 went 
mainly to a small group of five countries. Economic uncertainty, inhospitable 
business environments, weak property rights, and inadequate integration with the 
world economy are some areas of the African challenge where effective and 
continuous reforms need to be maintained over several years. For, without such 
reforms, it is unlikely that African countries will be able to generate higher 
levels of efficiency in existing resource use or mobilize the larger volume of 
resources they need to accelerate the rate of growth to levels that will reduce 
poverty. Average domestic savings, at $81 per capita (compared to $300 in East 
Asia and $671 in Latin America), are simply too low, and foreign aid is becoming 
increasingly constrained and selective. The kinds of payments relief 
contemplated under existing international debt initiatives will be useful, but 
still inadequate to address the reconstruction, redistribution and 
growth-promoting investment needs of most countries. Further, flight capital 
will only return to Africa if investment risks are lowered. Thus, together, the 
two factors discussed above reinforce the need for improved economic policies to 
stimulate investment in the context of a competitive environment and globally 
integrated economy.</P>
<P align=justify>The analysis points to another area of weakness in the recent 
economic performance--output growth has not increased employment at a 
commensurate pace. The data to describe employment trends in African countries 
in detail do not exist, but three broad observations can be made with reasonable 
confidence. <I>First</I>, in the aggregate employment in the modern, formal 
sectors of most economies is stagnant, or rising very sluggishly. It is not 
evident that the process of reallocation of formal employment across sectors 
that normally accompanies liberalization has taken place in all economies, nor 
that the expanding sectors have generated new employment in large numbers. As 
the labor force in African countries is rising at roughly 2.4 percent per year 
(the urban population often at double that rate), and there is a large backlog 
of unemployed workers to absorb, it is imperative that future economic growth be 
labor-using. <I>Second</I>, the rapid growth of the informal sector in most 
countries has provided a safety net in terms of adjustment to economic 
liberalization. Whether the informal sectors of most countries can provide 
permanent employment in high or growing productivity jobs remains an open 
question, not least because these are chiefly domestic market oriented 
activities, heavily dependent on the continuing growth of domestic incomes. As 
discussed below, one of the major risks faced by the African countries in a 
slowing global economy is the possibility that external demand will fail to grow 
as rapidly as in recent years, or even fall sharply.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Third</I>, it is arguable, but worth considering, that the 
comparative advantage of most African countries lies in labor intensive 
activities that utilize their abundant natural resources in a sustainable 
manner. This would, first of all, distinguish their economic strategy from the 
skills intensive models of manufacturing development of east Asia and Latin 
America, and require different operational approaches than applied in the past. 
But it would also mean that African countries will need to strike a balance 
between exploiting their natural resources aggressively to meet short term 
needs, and husbanding them for sustainable long term development. As recent 
African experience would suggest, its natural resources are a major attraction 
for foreign investors. Clearly, therefore, the question of how to use these 
resources will determine a large number of development outcomes--rising average 
incomes, number of people living below the poverty line. It is, therefore, 
central to Africa’s development path in the next period. </P><B>
<P align=justify>Some Challenges And Risks</B>. While the recent uptick in 
performance is encouraging, it still implies that at current growth rates it 
will take at least 30 years for the representative African country to double per 
capita income from its present low level. The margin for errors in economic 
management is much smaller at current levels of income. Unfortunately, it is 
possible to be hopeful, but not sanguine, about growth prospects. There are 
still areas of weakness in policy that could thwart a full recovery of many 
African economies, chiefly of private investment, without which there is little 
hope that incomes will rise rapidly enough for Africa to be able to catch up 
with the other developing regions.</P>
<P align=justify>The main immediate challenge seems to be its response to the 
global slowdown that has become evident during 1998. Present estimates suggest 
that the growth rate of the representative economy will fall by one to 
one-and-a-half percentage points below the 1997 level. The global slowdown is 
expected to halve the growth rate of world demand for Africa’s products, and 
falling commodity prices will inflict additional costs on some countries, 
chiefly exporters of metals and minerals. Here, the ability of African countries 
to minimize damage will depend, to a large extent, on convincing investors that 
liberal economic reforms have been set on a favorable and largely irreversible 
course, and upon the availability of external assistance. With regard to the 
former, the privatization of money-losing public enterprises--some of which is 
already underway--and the maintenance of sound macroeconomic policies is key. 
Nevertheless, a short term slowdown in growth seems inevitable. </P>
<P align=justify>But what of the future? The challenge in Africa is to broaden 
and intensify its recent performance, step up the rate of growth for all 
countries, and ensure that development processes are sustained over time. 
Sustainability embraces several dimensions. In today’s African context, perhaps 
the most important of these is to address the major risk factors in health (low 
birthweight babies, child malnutrition, HIV/AIDS prevalence) and education (low 
primary school enrollments and overall quality).</P>
<P align=justify>In these areas, the most devastating threat to Africa’s 
prospects comes from the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. Africa has been the hardest 
hit among continents. The 15 countries with the highest prevalence rates in the 
world lie in this region; two in every three persons and eight of every ten 
females presently living with the disease are from Africa. In almost half of the 
region HIV/AIDS prevalence among adults (15-49 years) exceeds 8 percent, but in 
some countries it has risen to 20-30 percent. It is beginning to reduce life 
expectancy and infant and child survival; in some countries 25 percent more 
infants are dying than would be the case without the disease. Nearly 8 million 
HIV/AIDS orphans under the age of 15 years live in the region. Losses of 
experienced personnel, especially in professions that require high mobility 
(e.g., agricultural extension, transport), absenteeism, increased labor 
turnover, and increased health care costs are just some of the most immediate 
manifestations of the epidemic. Given that individuals infected with HIV have 
not yet developed AIDS, the sharp increase in HIV prevalance suggests that the 
peak of the epidemic is yet to be felt in Africa. In addition to impeding or 
reversing many of the hard-won gains in the development of human capacity in 
Africa, the problem of HIV/AIDS is much more than a health or demographic issue, 
because the disease affects people in their most productive years. It will 
undoubtedly have a contractionary effect on African output in the first years of 
the millennium, even if strong actions are put in place today to slow the spread 
of infection; how big an effect is still unknown.</P>
<P align=justify>African governments need to also address other risk factors, 
that, if not taken care of today, will undermine Africa’s long term prospects. 
The main ones are governance, property rights, and the long term productivity of 
infrastructure and environmental services. Africa has moved from being a net 
exporter to a net importer of food which, together with its aid dependence, 
makes it the most vulnerable of all regions to unforeseen declines or 
interruptions in global food production. Participation and social inclusion, 
long neglected, are vital to generate the needed dynamism of African societies 
and ensure the viability of political states. In addition, in order to arrest 
Africa’s marginalization and narrow the gap with the leading developing regions 
of the world, there is need to design and implement practical programs to 
enhance and build domestic skills and capacities, and for exploiting all the 
opportunities offered by global trade, investment and knowledge-sharing.</P>
<P align=justify>The last of these is now acknowledged as a powerful engine of 
development. With recent achievements that reduce the costs of collecting and 
disseminating knowledge, it is possible to narrow the intellectual distance 
between the leading and lagging countries. It is also possible, in some key 
areas, for the latter to leapfrog into the future. Africa (as a competitor in 
the global economy), people living in its remoter regions, and groups that have 
been holding the short-end of the stick in market transactions have to 
participate in the information revolution. Integration into this new information 
age requires a threshold level of domestic capacity and education to be able to 
access and assimilate this new knowledge, as well as the willingness to embrace 
radical reform in key sector such as telecommunications. In many cases, the 
balance between traditional development drivers (e.g. roads, extension agents, 
or bricks-and-mortar schools) and the new drivers (e.g. market information 
carried over telecoms links) will have to be re-examined. The rules of the 
development game are changing rapidly, and the greatest challenge in the next 
century will be to keep pace with this change and use it effectively for 
reducing the number of African poor.</P>
