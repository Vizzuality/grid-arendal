  <P>For over a decade diverse groups throughout the world have endeavored to 
  create an <A href="http://www.earthcharter.org/draft/charter.htm">Earth 
  Charter</A> that sets forth fundamental ethical principles for a sustainable 
  way of life. Hundreds of groups and thousands of individuals have been 
  involved in the process. Representatives from government and nongovernmental 
  organizations worked to secure adoption of an Earth Charter during the Rio 
  Earth Summit in 1992. However, the time was not right. A new Earth Charter 
  initiative was launched by the Earth Council and Green Cross International in 
  1994. 
  <P>An Earth Charter Commission was formed in 1997 to oversee the project and 
  the drafting of the Charter. The Secretariat for the Commission is at the 
  Earth Council in Costa Rica. In March, 1997, at the conclusion of the Rio+5 
  Forum in Rio de Janeiro, the Earth Charter Commission issued the Benchmark 
  Draft Earth Charter. The Commission also called for ongoing international 
  consultations on the text of the document. 
  <P>Between 1997 and 1999 over forty national Earth Charter committees were 
  formed, and numerous Earth Charter conferences were held. Comments and 
  recommendations from all regions of the world were forwarded to the Earth 
  Council and the Drafting Committee. Guided by these contributions to the 
  consultation process, the text of the Charter was extensively revised. In 
  April, 1999, the Earth Charter Commission issued Benchmark Draft II. The 
  consultation process continued throughout 1999 in order to provide individuals 
  and groups with a further opportunity to make contributions to the drafting 
  process. As a result of the worldwide consultation process, the Earth Charter 
  Commission issued a final version of the Earth Charter after their meeting on 
  March 12 - 14, 2000 at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. 
  <P><FONT size=+1>Objectives of the International Earth Charter Initiative 
  are:</FONT> 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>To disseminate the Earth Charter to individuals and organizations in all 
    sectors of society throughout the world. 
    <LI>To promote the educational use of the Earth Charter in schools, 
    universities, faith communities, and a variety of other settings, and to 
    develop and distribute the necessary supporting materials. 
    <LI>To encourage and support the use, implementation, and endorsement of the 
    Earth Charter by civil society, business, and government at all levels. 
    <LI>To seek endorsement of the Earth Charter by the United Nations General 
    Assembly in 2002, the tenth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit. </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT size=+1>A Declaration of Interdependence and Principles for 
  Sustainable Development</FONT> 
  <P>The Earth Charter is a declaration of interdependence and responsibility 
  and an urgent call to build a global partnership for sustainable development. 
  <P>The principles of the Earth Charter are closely interrelated. Together they 
  provide a conception of sustainable development and set forth fundamental 
  guidelines for achieving it. These principles are drawn from international 
  law, science, philosophy, religion, recent UN Summit meetings, and the 
  international Earth Charter conversation on global ethics. 
  <P>The goal of sustainable development is full human development and 
  ecological protection. The Earth Charter recognizes that humanity's 
  environmental, economic, social, cultural, ethical, and spiritual problems and 
  aspirations are interconnected. It affirms the need for holistic thinking and 
  collaborative, integrated problem solving. Sustainable development requires 
  such an approach. It is about freedom, justice, participation, and peace as 
  well as environmental protection and economic well-being. 
  <P><FONT size=+1>The Design of the Earth Charter</FONT> 
  <P>Some groups would prefer a short Earth Charter that is a prayer or poem or 
  a declaration with five to ten principles only. Others strongly favor a more 
  substantial document that is more like an intergovernmental declaration. 
  <P>In an effort to address these different concerns, the Drafting Committee 
  has created a layered document with a Preamble, sixteen main principles, 
  various supporting principles, and a conclusion. The principles are divided 
  into four parts. 
  <P>The supporting principles offer clarification and elaboration of the ideas 
  in the main principles. The supporting principles provide an overview of the 
  many issues that have been raised by various groups in the course of the 
  international consultation process. Those who favor a very short Earth Charter 
  would like to see the supporting principles significantly reduced in number or 
  eliminated. Others feel passionately that the supporting principles are an 
  essential part of the Charter because they make explicit the practical meaning 
  of the main principles with reference to critical issues. The supporting 
  principles are especially important to groups that feel marginalized and 
  excluded from decision making processes. 
  <P><FONT size=+1>Three Ways to Present the Earth Charter Vision</FONT> 
  <UL>
    <LI>Use the first four Principles only as a short version. 
    <LI>Use the two-page Abbreviated Version with the full Preamble, the sixteen 
    main principles only, and the conclusion. 
    <LI>Use the full document with the Preamble, the main principles together 
    with the supporting principles, and the conclusion. </LI></UL><FONT
