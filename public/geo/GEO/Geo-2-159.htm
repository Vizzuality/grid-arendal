    <TD>During the 20 years after the establishment of the Environment Agency 
      in 1971, the environmental situation at both the national and global level 
      has undergone substantial changes. At the national level, notable 
      achievements have been accomplished in combating severe pollution during 
      the time of high economic growth, however, air pollution by nitrogen 
      oxides in major urban areas, water pollution due to household effluent and 
      waste disposal have continued to pose ever more difficult problems. 
      Furthermore, due to the various development projects such as resort, the 
      threat to the natural environment has increased . 
      <P>On the other hand, concerns over the global environment issues are 
      mounting worldwide: i.e., the impact of the global warming, depletion of 
      the ozone layer, deforestation, biodiversity loss, transboundary movement 
      of acid rain, and hazardous waste, etc. In the few years since the Earth 
      Summit, many countries are being urged to implement concrete actions and 
      measures in order to realize sustainable development, as was agreed at the 
      Earth Summit. 
      <P>Here in Japan, the Basic Environment Law setting out basic principles 
      and directions for the making of environmental policies was enacted in 
      November 1993. In December of the same year, the "National Action Plan for 
      Agenda 21" was submitted to the United Nations. The following year, in 
      December 1994 was adopted an action plan, the Basic Environment Plan, 
      being the most important measure which the Basic Environmental Law newly 
      introduced. This plan systematically clarifies what needs to be done by 
      the beginning of the 21st century in terms of national measures and local 
      government, corporate and individual actions. It also defines the roles of 
      the parties involved and ways and means for effectively pursuing 
      environmental policies. 
      <P>Moreover, the Environment Agency is positively taking a set of 
      supportive measures, including one designed to support the appropriate 
      transfer of technology through "the UNEP International Environment 
      Technology Center" as a core organization, in order to enrich and 
      reinforce the ODA system to realize sustainable development in developing 
      countries. 
      <P>The regions we are particularly interested in are the Asia and the 
      Pacific regions because of their proximity to Japan. These regions have 
      been confronted with numerous problems because of spiralling population 
      and poverty, accelerated consumption of resources and energy due to 
      life-style sophistication, transformation of urban environment, etc. In 
      order to surmount these problems, the Environment Agency is planning to 
      work on conservation of regional environmental integrity and promote 
      intraregional cooperation by activating closer dialogues concerning 
      environmental policies discussed at "the Environment Congress for Asia and 
      the Pacific (Eco-Asia)". 
      <P>Today, environmental issues are a common challenge to us all as they 
      range over diverse matters from those of direct daily concern to the wider 
      global arena and even into the future of generations to come. Thinking 
      about the cumulative effects of separate environmental problems and the 
      great impact they can have on the earth, our survival base, it is vital 
      that the central and local governments, enterprises and individuals are 
      required to take well-coordinated cooperative action, both international 
      and domestic, to effectively respond to these issues. </P></TD></TR>
