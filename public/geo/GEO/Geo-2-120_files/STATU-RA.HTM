<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>International Network of Basin Organisations was 
established during the constitutive assembly in 1994 at Aix-les-Bains, France, 
by organisations whose common goal was to implement integrated basin water 
resource management, which made a voluntary act of joining the charter adopted

meetings in Valencia, Spain, 1997 and in Salvador, Brasil, 1998. </FONT></P>
