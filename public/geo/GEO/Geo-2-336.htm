<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it not for earthquakes, climate prediction 
could be called the last frontier in natural disaster early warning. Early 
warning systems have been developed for many natural hazards and, while neither 
the systems nor the options for response are perfect, there has been progress 
over the past several decades toward using early warning in preventing, or at 
least mitigating, some kinds of natural disasters. Volcano monitoring, for 
example, coupled with civil defense preparedness, led to the timely evacuation 
of the vicinity around Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines immediately prior to 
its 1991 eruption, saving thousands of lives. Storm warning systems that prompt 
the evacuation of coastal areas prevent loss of life, even during storms strong 
enough to inflict devastating property damage. Locust monitoring and spraying 
kill larvae before they can swarm and cause widespread crop damage.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Earthquake prediction efforts have yet to yield 
reliable early warning. If reliable prediction methods emerge, however, civil 
defense and evacuation response options will presumably become as viable for 
earthquakes as they are for other localized natural hazards. Given the current 
state of the art, even approved building codes and seismically resistant 
construction techniques, when adopted, have proved effective at minimizing loss 
of life.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Climatic hazards -- especially droughts and floods 
-- have not only proved so far difficult to predict, but their widespread and 
multisectoral impacts pose challenges for effective societal response. 
Historically, droughts and floods have affected more people worldwide than any 
other cause of disaster (IFRC 1995, p. 102). These hazards affect food security, 
especially in poor areas where options for coping with disaster are limited. El 
Niño /Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasting is a scientific advance with the 
potential to provide drought and flood early warning. At the least, it can 
suggest regions of the world where, depending on ENSO activity in the equatorial 
Pacific, the probability that climate conditions will tend to favor drought or 
flood conditions for various locations around the globe is heightened or 
reduced. This chapter discusses strategies for reducing the impacts of such 
climate-related shocks on food security and the role that ENSO-based early 
warning information can play.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In nonindustrialized countries in particular, 
climate affects food security both directly, through its impacts on food 
production, and indirectly, through the impacts of climate variations on 
people's livelihoods. Human health consequences of climatic conditions or events 
also relate to food security. Good health is necessary for individual food 
security through the ability of the body to use food. Health also affects 
household food security though its impacts on productive members' ability to 
produce and earn income. Climate conditions favorable for vectors can promote 
the transmission of disease. Sanitation problems that accompany flooding or 
large concentrations of displaced people affect health and nutrition.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When adverse conditions, climatic or otherwise, 
overwhelm the capacity of large numbers of people to cope, an international 
response may ensue. Major international disaster response organizations include 
the United Nations, donor countries, international Private Voluntary 
Organizations (PVOs), and national institutions in the affected country. During 
disasters, emergency assistance is provided by international agencies over and 
above normal development assistance (and sometimes exceeding it). A large 
portion of U.S. humanitarian assistance goes to Africa -- over $500 million in 
fiscal year (FY) 94 (October 1993 to September 1994) -- a continent afflicted 
with poverty, conflict, pests, drought, and floods. Expanding rural populations 
in many African countries increase pressures on fragile lands, increasing the 
sensitivity of food production systems and the livelihood of growing numbers of 
people to climate variations.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In regions where climate shocks, particularly 
drought, are linked to ENSO events, ENSO forecasting has the potential to 
provide the response community with an early warning during which to mobilize a 
more timely and coordinated response. More importantly, the ability to 
anticipate hazardous climate events through ENSO forecasting gives ENSO-affected 
regions the opportunity to increase their own capacity to withstand climate 
shocks and reduce human suffering, economic losses, and the need for outside 
assistance. For ENSO forecasts to promote food security in food-insecure areas 
through improved early warning, two-way communication is needed between the 
early warning and response communities. Responders and affected populations must 
generally understand the scientific basis for regional climate prediction, its 
possible applications, and its uncertainties. Climate forecasters must, in turn, 
understand options and strategies for disaster management available to the 
international response community and affected populations, and their limits. If 
these preconditions are met, early warning information can be translated into 
effective actions to reduce disastrous climate-related impacts.
<P><B>When Disaster Triggers Response</B>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the <I>U.N. Human Development 
Report</I> (UNDP, 1994), in the 45 least developed countries, 46% of the 
population lacked access to health services, 55% lacked safe drinking water, the 
average daily calorie supply per capita was 91% of requirements, and 64% lived 
in absolute poverty. Official international development assistance constitutes 
an ongoing response to this situation. Humanitarian assistance, or disaster 
relief, is a special category of additional assistance during acute crises. 
Humanitarian responses are usually precipitated by an identifiable triggering 
event, such as a conflict or a drought. A disaster occurs when a triggering 
event strikes a vulnerable population. Vulnerability is a relative term and may 
be a function of exposure to hazards, or of the capacity of an individual, 
group, or society to cope with the hazard. In other words, it is a function of 
exposure both to risks and the consequences thereof (Downing 1991, p. 372). 
Vulnerability can be a chronic condition and/or episodically acute. Where the 
vulnerability of many people is high, even a modest triggering event can cause 
significant loss of life and destruction. A population whose vulnerability is 
low can withstand events of greater magnitude without experiencing loss of life 
and socioeconomic disruption leading to a disaster requiring outside assistance.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The criteria vary for determining whether a given 
event constitutes a disaster. The U.S. offers humanitarian assistance to other 
countries, when a disaster is declared by the Chief of the U.S. Mission in the 
affected country (OFDA 1993, p. 15). The Center for Research on the Epidemiology 
of Disasters uses the criteria of 10 people killed and/or 100 affected, and/or 
an appeal for assistance to define a disaster (IFRC 1995, p. 93). Affected 
countries can declare a disaster and appeal for outside assistance. The United 
Nations also issues emergency appeals.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is overwhelming evidence that the climatic 
events that trigger some of these disasters are linked to ENSO. ENSO impacts on 
regional climates and food supply are well-documented. An ENSO index has been 
shown to be strongly correlated with maize yields in Zimbabwe (Cane et al., 
1994) and in Oaxaca, Mexico (Dilley, 1996). ENSO impacts on crops in Australia 
have been identified (e.g., Nicholls 1985; 1986). Droughts corresponding to ENSO 
warm events have been shown to be associated statistically with disasters in 
Southeast Asia/Oceania and southern Africa (Dilley and Heyman, 1995). Drought 
impacts on agricultural production and water resources have been reported in 
southern Africa in 1995 in association with a moderate ENSO warm event (FEWS, 
1995a; FEWS, 1995b). Temperature and precipitation variations associated with 
ENSO have been associated with outbreaks of contagious disease (Epstein, 1994). 
Flooding affects sanitation and the prevalence of waterborne disease. The 
adverse economic impacts of these climatic hazards also affect food security, by 
lessening people's ability to purchase food as well as to produce it.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the increasingly large numbers of 
emergencies worldwide, international organizations must prioritize where to 
respond, and with what level of resources. The following criteria from the USAID 
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA, 1994) are representative:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Where can OFDA resources assist the greatest number of victims? Can OFDA's 
  resources reach the victims?
  <P></P>
  <LI>To what degree is security of relief workers and relief supplies adequate 
  to undertake and sustain a relief operation?
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is or will be the level of cooperation from the governing 
authorities?
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the level of commitment and funding from other donors? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the ability of OFDA and its implementing partners to respond in a 
  timely fashion with appropriate interventions?
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the level of interest of the U.S. government? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the level of interest of the American people?
  <P></P></LI></UL>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the resources of international 
disaster response organizations increasingly being consumed by the needs of 
refugees and people displaced by conflict, and with response organizations 
having to make tough choices, it is imperative that countries in regions exposed 
to predictable natural hazards begin to improve their understanding of the 
nature of those hazards, assess their vulnerability, and take appropriate (i.e., 
effective) measures to reduce their own vulnerability. 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Linking response to early warning involves both 
short- and long-term actions, representing two strategies that use ENSO 
information in different ways. Short-term (tactical) uses of early warning -- of 
the actual warning itself -- generally involve preparedness. In the case of 
floods, for example, shelters can be built, evacuation plans prepared, and civil 
defense procedures defined. When the warning is given, these preparedness 
measures permit the population to be effectively warned and to seek shelter. 
Early drought warning allows disaster response organizations to initiate the 
programming and transport of food aid, so that aid will arrive where and when it 
is needed. However, in the short period of time between the early warning and 
the actual outbreak of crisis, the response alternatives of international 
disaster response agencies are limited. Basically, they are limited to providing 
goods, cash, services, or information. These are often delivered in the form of 
disaster relief through PVOs, who, funded by the international donors, design 
and implement relief and rehabilitation interventions. Donors must decide among 
expensive alternatives, the positive effects of many of which will be 
short-lived. Considerations used by OFDA for evaluating relief interventions 
include but are not limited to the following:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Is the intervention necessary/appropriate? And will it save lives and 
  reduce suffering? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the project technically sound? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Can the activity be implemented, and in a timely manner?
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the likelihood of success, given the location within the country 
  of the proposed activity?
  <P></P>
  <LI>Given its location, how important is it to the most urgent relief 
  requirements? To the largest concentrations of people? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the organization requesting funding capable of delivering the 
  assistance? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the intervention duplicative? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Can other donors be encouraged to provide the assistance in a timely 
  manner? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the relief or emergency rehabilitation activity appropriate for OFDA 
  funding?
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is management and coordination expertise (usually UN coordination) 
  required on the ground to assure success of the relief effort? Is it available 
  or will it be available in a timely manner? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the intervention compatible with existing or anticipated development 
  programs?
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the intervention likely to be acceptable to the government or, in 
  conflict zones, to the insurgent groups? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the duration of the activity (not more than 12 months) (OFDA, 
  1994)? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>In the initial phase of an emergency response, relief is a higher priority 
  than rehabilitation. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>OFDA discourages heavy capital investments to initiate relief programs.
  <P></P></LI></UL>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For these interventions to be fully 
effective, it is essential that they reflect the priorities of the affected 
population (Cuny, 1983). The chaos of a disaster situation, however, can be a 
difficult time to establish the links between responders and local institutions 
and communities. Opportunities for engaging the beneficiary population in 
reducing their own vulnerability to disasters are greater when early warning 
information can be incorporated into their decision-making processes over the 
longer term.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a natural hazard is explainable and 
predictable (e.g., the possibility offered by regional climate prediction based 
on forecasts of ENSO or other large-scale climate forcing factors), 
opportunities for long-term approaches to disaster prevention and mitigation 
increase. Natural disaster prevention and mitigation strategies succeed by 
reducing vulnerability, since the magnitudes and timing of natural hazard events 
are not subject to human control. Vulnerability reduction over the long term is 
part of the development process undertaken by the society at risk, ideally with 
the cooperation of international donors. This process begins well in advance of 
a triggering event or early warning but can capitalize on the existence an early 
warning system. 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the risk of exposure to the hazard cannot 
easily be lessened, attempts must be made to increase coping capacity and reduce 
the consequences of the exposure. Both faces of vulnerability -- risks of 
exposure to a hazard and, especially, risks of consequences from that exposure 
-- are often related to poverty. Food insecurity is very related to poverty. 
Reducing poverty and, therefore, chronic food insecurity is an objective of 
sustainable development. The task in disaster prevention and mitigation is more 
specific than broad-based poverty reduction (a desirable but overwhelming 
objective). Mitigation efforts are targeted at those vulnerable to a particular 
hazard, based on an understanding of who is vulnerable, and how and why they are 
vulnerable. This analysis creates opportunities to take steps to reduce that 
specific vulnerability. An early warning system provides information inputs for 
this task, provided that flexibility can be built into food production and 
economic systems to use early warning information in ways that help people to 
anticipate, prevent, and, if not prevent, at least mitigate, negative climatic 
impacts. This requires coordination between the early warning and the response 
communities.
<P><B>What Information Is Needed from the Early Warning Community?</B>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ENSO impacts are felt in teleconnected regions 
worldwide, especially in the tropics. Many of these regions have the resources 
to cope with climate fluctuations and/or have developed strategies to withstand 
them without experiencing severely adverse food security consequences. While all 
teleconnected regions can benefit from understanding ENSO's impacts, areas where 
ENSO has disastrous impacts on food security deserve particular attention from 
the early warning community. For example, countries in two regions -- southern 
Africa and Southeast Asia/Oceania -- have historically been forced to declare 
drought disasters during ENSO warm events (<A 
href="http://www.brad.ac.uk/research/ijas/ijasno2/dilley1.jpg">Figure 1</A>). 
For these two regions, ENSO forecasts provide valuable information for response, 
because the countries within them tend to experience climate-related disasters 
during the mature stages of ENSO warm events but not at other times. The 
occurrence of a warm event increases the possibility that a drought disaster 
will occur. In addition, this pattern provides evidence that countries in these 
regions have not taken adequate steps to reduce their drought vulnerability. 
Some countries that experience ENSO-related hydrometeorological droughts but are 
not forced to declare disaster have apparently already succeeded in reducing 
their vulnerability sufficiently to withstand ENSO-related climate shocks. 
Greater focus on southern Africa and Southeast Asia/Oceania, in terms of 
providing information about what ENSO is and what its regional impacts are, 
could be a step toward mobilizing action to reduce vulnerability. 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the drought of 1991-92 in southern Africa, 
awareness in both the early warning and disaster response communities of ENSO 
impacts on regional climates -- particularly of droughts and floods -- has been 
sharply improved. Heavy rains and flooding in the U.S. throughout the early 
1990s, associated by some observers with a prolonged ENSO warm event, has made 
ENSO a nightly feature of televised weather reports. This sort of broad-based 
public education, along with special concentration on key groups of specialists 
(e.g., potential users of ENSO information), is an important outreach component 
of climate science to both the general public and the response community. It is 
important to sustain this educational effort, so that increased awareness is 
enhanced by better understanding of both ENSO's impacts and the current 
limitations of scientific research focused on ENSO. (NOAA's <I>Report to the 
Nation, El Niño and Climate Prediction</I> [UCAR, 1994] provides a good example 
of how a basic understanding of ENSO and its impacts can be effectively 
communicated.) Disseminating basic knowledge about ENSO creates a context in 
which ENSO-based early warnings can be heard and understood. In poor countries, 
where vulnerability is high, achieving this level of public awareness poses 
special challenges. Potential mechanisms for promoting ENSO awareness include 
disaster training and education programs, scientific and policy workshops, 
classrooms, agricultural extension, and the media.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A main vehicle for early warning based on ENSO 
forecasts is a regional climate forecast. However, regional climate forecasts 
need to be qualified in at least two ways: How reliable is the forecast of an 
ENSO event (this is what climatologists in the region need to know); and how 
reliable is the regional climate prediction (this is what decisionmakers need to 
know)? The accuracy of an ENSO forecast depends on a "correct" interpretation of 
sea-surface temperature and atmospheric sea-level pressure indicators in the 
equatorial Pacific, and on numerical climate modeling. An improved ENSO forecast 
should indicate both the likely strength of the event and the location of the 
anomalous warm pool in the central or eastern equatorial Pacific. In turn, 
regional climatologists in teleconnected regions can take a general ENSO 
forecast and tailor it to their regions, taking into account observed regional 
climate conditions, seasonality, and the behavior of regional synoptic factors. 
A reliable, regional, ENSO-related forecast that includes an analysis of impacts 
across multiple sectors of society will help bridge the gap to potential users. 
Early warning systems analysts can convert the f orecast into terms relating it 
to the implications for food security.
<P><B>What Actions Can Be Taken on the Basis of ENSO-Based Early Warnings?</B>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specific strategies for preventing, mitigating, or 
preparing for (e.g., adapting to) ENSO-related disasters depend on prevailing 
socioeconomic conditions and institutional resources in each region, and the 
nature (e.g., strength, reliability) of the teleconnection. In regions whose 
teleconnections pose a high risk of exposure to climatic hazards, vulnerability 
assessments can be undertaken. The risk of exposure can be assessed, 
geographically identifying those areas particularly likely to experience the 
hazard. The risk of consequences can also be assessed (e.g., which social groups 
are likely to suffer consequences), as well as which sectors (e.g., agriculture, 
livestock, water and sanitation, health). The assessment of the risks of 
consequences from a climatic hazard associated with ENSO may be expressed 
spatially, according to where people live who have been identified as 
particularly vulnerable to consequences of regional ENSO impacts. Vulnerability 
assessments provide information for targeting development and mitigation 
activities in order to reduce chronic vulnerability among the most vulnerable 
populations. 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following examples focus on drought, although 
measures to prevent, mitigate, and prepare for floods can also be identified. 
Preparedness strategies are feasible for international response organizations, 
national governments, and affected populations. International response 
organizations that are aware of ENSO events (for example, the USAID Famine Early 
Warning System or the Southern Africa Development Community [SADC] Regional 
Early Warning System) can, however, act earlier to anticipate food-aid needs. 
Hence, they can prepare to provide assistance prior to drought disasters, as was 
done on the basis of ENSO signals during the 1994-95 drought in southern Africa. 
The training of disaster responders at the national level also provides a means 
by which national and municipal governments can become better partners in a 
response. In Latin America, disaster management training has been extremely 
effective in decreasing the need for outside assistance in responding to 
regional disasters. Perhaps most importantly, public awareness campaigns and 
information dissemination can both educate the general public and provide it 
with information useful for decisionmaking at the individual and household 
levels. This approach empowers the affected population to take control of its 
own response to the potential crisis. Australia has pursued this strategy by 
providing ENSO information to support farmer and herder decisionmaking in the 
face of probable droughts.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mitigation strategies strengthen the coping 
capacities of vulnerable groups. Some approaches capitalize on the availability 
of an early warning system and seek to maximize food production or income, based 
on a regional climate forecast. Planting dates can be adjusted and 
drought-tolerant crops planted when rains are expected to be delayed or 
inadequate. Livestock can be sold to reduce herd sizes and to maximize returns 
prior to a drought. Water conservation measures can be undertaken. National food 
policies can be adjusted to ensure adequate food stocks or regional trade 
linkages. Mitigation objectives can also be achieved through sustainable 
development efforts that seek to promote food security. Creating access to 
markets through road construction is a prerequisite for enabling the destocking 
of herds prior to the onset of droughts. Drought-tolerant crops such as cassava 
can be promoted through agricultural extension and PVO projects. Natural 
resource management, soil and water conservation, and irrigation resource 
development are all strategies that can be implemented at the local level with 
funding channeled through PVOs. Small-scale irrigation not only provides drought 
protection but also diversifies and protects income-generation possibilities, an 
important aspect of food security (e.g., capacity-building at the local level). 
During a disaster, it is a good time to promote mitigation, while the hazard is 
fresh in everyone's mind. Thus, disaster relief can be used to promote 
longer-term food security. Well improvement, for example, is a low-cost measure 
that permits a well to provide water through dry periods, providing longer-term 
protection against drought. International responses can distribute 
drought-tolerant seeds. Even "appropriate" food aid can contribute, by helping 
to develop tastes and markets for sorghum or other drought-tolerant cereals.
<P><B>Conclusion</B>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Information exchange between the early warning and 
response communities requires a two-way flow. For its part, the response 
community must continue to be exposed to and learn about ENSO, i.e., what it is 
and its impacts in particular regions. The early warning community must 
understand the limitations of humanitarian assistance and constraints on, and 
opportunities for, disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. Such 
communication will promote sharing of ENSO information relevant for reducing 
vulnerability and food insecurity. For the purposes of early warning and 
response, it is less necessary, for example, to gain a complete understanding of 
the entire hydrologic cycle of a region than it is to engage in outreach and 
public education. General scientific information may be "good enough" as a basis 
for decisionmaking under certain conditions, where detailed analysis of systems 
could obscure the main point. By keeping the end-use in mind, scientific 
knowledge about ENSO can be put to use toward linking ENSO forecasts to disaster 
early warning and, therefore, to disaster reduction.
