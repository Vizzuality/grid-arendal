<H1>The Costs and Ancillary9 Benefits of Mitigation Actions <BR></H1>
<P><A name=11></A>11. Estimates of cost and benefits of mitigation actions 
differ because of (i) how welfare is measured, (ii) the scope and methodology of 
the analysis, and (iii) the underlying assumptions built into the analysis. As a 
result, estimated costs and benefits may not reflect the actual costs and 
benefits of implementing mitigation actions. With respect to (i) and (ii), costs 
and benefits estimates, inter alia, depend on revenue recycling, and whether and 
how the following are considered: implementation and transaction cost, 
distributional impacts, multiple gases, land-use change options, benefits of 
avoided climate change, ancillary benefits, no regrets opportunities<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>10</SUP></SMALL></A> 
and valuation of externalities and non-market impacts. Assumptions include, 
inter alia:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Demographic change, the rate and structure of economic growth; increases 
  in personal mobility, technological innovation such as improvements in energy 
  efficiency and the availability of low-cost energy sources, flexibility of 
  capital investments and labour markets, prices, fiscal distortions in the 
  no-policy (baseline) scenario. 
  <LI>The level and timing of the mitigation target. 
  <LI>Assumptions regarding implementation measures, e.g. the extent of 
  emissions trading, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint 
  Implementation (JI), regulation, and voluntary agreements <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>11</SUP></SMALL></A> 
  and the associated transaction costs. 
  <LI>Discount rates: the long time scales make discounting assumptions critical 
  and there is still no consensus on appropriate long-term rates, though the 
  literature shows increasing attention to rates that decline over time and 
  hence give more weight to benefits that occur in the long term. These discount 
  rates should be distinguished from the higher rates that private agents 
  generally use in market transactions.<BR>(Sections <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/271.htm">7.2</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/283.htm">7.3</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/322.htm#821">8.2.1</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/326.htm">8.2.2</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/374.htm">9.4</A>) </LI></UL>
<P><A name=12></A>12. Some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at 
no or negative net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no 
regrets opportunities (Sections <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/291.htm">7.3.4</A>, <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/356.htm#921">9.2.1</A>):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Market imperfections. Reduction of existing market or institutional 
  failures and other barriers that impede adoption of cost-effective emission 
  reduction measures, can lower private costs compared to current practice. This 
  can also reduce private costs overall. 
  <LI>Ancillary benefits. Climate change mitigation measures will have effects 
  on other societal issues. For example, reducing carbon emissions in many cases 
  will result in the simultaneous reduction in local and regional air pollution. 
  It is likely that mitigation strategies will also affect transportation, 
  agriculture, land-use practices and waste management and will have an impact 
  on other issues of social concern, such as employment, and energy security. 
  However, not all of the effects will be positive; careful policy selection and 
  design can better ensure positive effects and minimize negative impacts. In 
  some cases, the magnitude of ancillary benefits of mitigation may be 
  comparable to the costs of the mitigating measures, adding to the no regrets 
  potential, although estimates are difficult to make and vary widely (Sections 
  <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/288.htm">7.3.3</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/334.htm">8.2.4</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/359.htm">9.2.2</A>-<A

  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/371.htm">9.2.10</A>). 
  <LI>Double dividend. Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned permits) provide 
  revenues to the government. If used to finance reductions in existing 
  distortionary taxes (&#8220;revenue recycling&#8221;), these revenues reduce the economic 
  cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions. The magnitude of this offset 
  depends on the existing tax structure, type of tax cuts, labour market 
  conditions, and method of recycling. Under some circumstances, it is possible 
  that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of mitigation (Sections <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/288.htm">7.3.3</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/326.htm">8.2.2</A>, <A

<P><A name=13></A>13. The cost estimates for Annex B countries to implement the 
Kyoto Protocol vary between studies and regions as indicated in <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/007.htm">Paragraph 11</A>, and depend 
strongly upon the assumptions regarding the use of the Kyoto mechanisms, and 
their interactions with domestic measures. The great majority of global studies 
reporting and comparing these costs use international energy-economic models. 
Nine of these studies suggest the following GDP impacts <A

(Sections 7.3.5, 8.3.1, 9.2.3, 10.4.4): </P>
<P>Annex II countries<A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>13</SUP></SMALL></A> 
: In the absence of emissions trading between Annex B countries<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>14</SUP></SMALL></A>, 
the majority of global studies show reductions in projected GDP of about 0.2% to 
2% in 2010 for different Annex II regions. With full emissions trading between 
Annex B countries, the estimated reductions in 2010 are between 0.1% and 1.1% of 
projected GDP<A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>15</SUP></SMALL></A>. 
These studies encompass a wide range of assumptions as listed in Paragraph 11. 
Models whose results are reported in this paragraph assume full use of emissions 
trading without transaction cost. Results for cases that do not allow Annex B 
trading assume full domestic trading within each region. Models do not include 
sinks or non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> greenhouse gases. They do not include the CDM, 
negative cost options, ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue 
recycling.<BR><BR>For all regions costs are also influenced by the following 
factors: <BR></P>
<UL>
  <LI>Constraints on the use of Annex B trading, high transaction costs in 
  implementing the mechanisms, and inefficient domestic implementation could 
  raise costs. 
  <LI>Inclusion in domestic policy and measures of the no regrets 
  possibilities<A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>10</SUP></SMALL></A> 
  identified in <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/007.htm#12">Paragraph 
  12</A>, use of the CDM, sinks, and inclusion of non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> greenhouse 
  gases, could lower costs. Costs for individual countries can vary more 
  widely.<BR></LI></UL>
<P>The models show that the Kyoto mechanisms are important in controlling risks 
of high costs in given countries, and thus can complement domestic policy 
mechanisms. Similarly, they can minimize risks of inequitable international 
impacts and help to level marginal costs. The global modelling studies reported 
above show national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets from about US$20/tC 
up to US$600/tC without trading, and a range from about US$15/tC up to US$150/tC 
with Annex B trading. The cost reductions from these mechanisms may depend on 
the details of implementation, including the compatibility of domestic and 
international mechanisms, constraints, and transaction costs.</P>
<P>Economies in transition: For most of these countries, GDP effects range from 
negligible to a several per cent increase. This reflects opportunities for 
energy efficiency improvements not available to Annex II countries. Under 
assumptions of drastic energy efficiency improvement and/or continuing economic 
recessions in some countries, the assigned amounts may exceed projected 
emissions in the first commitment period. In this case, models show increased 
GDP due to revenues from trading assigned amounts. However, for some economies 
in transition, implementing the Kyoto Protocol will have similar impact on GDP 
as for Annex II countries.</P>
<P><A name=14></A>14. Cost-effectiveness studies with a century timescale 
estimate that the costs of stabilizing CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations in the 
atmosphere increase as the concentration stabilization level declines. Different 
baselines can have a strong influence on absolute costs. While there is a 
moderate increase in the costs when passing from a 750ppmv to a 550ppmv 
concentration stabilization level, there is a larger increase in costs passing 
from 550ppmv to 450ppmv unless the emissions in the baseline scenario are very 
low. These results, however, do not incorporate carbon sequestration, gases 
other than CO<SUB>2</SUB> and did not examine the possible effect of more 
ambitious targets on induced technological change <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>16</SUP></SMALL></A>. 
Costs associated with each concentration level depend on numerous factors 
including the rate of discount, distribution of emission reductions over time, 
policies and measures employed, and particularly the choice of the baseline 
scenario: for scenarios characterized by a focus on local and regional 
sustainable development for example, total costs of stabilizing at a particular 
level are significantly lower than for other scenarios<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>17</SUP></SMALL></A> 
(Sections <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/082.htm#252">2.5.2</A>, <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/346.htm#841">8.4.1</A>, <A

<P><A name=15></A>15. Under any greenhouse gas mitigation effort, the economic 
costs and benefits are distributed unevenly between sectors; to a varying 
degree, the costs of mitigation actions could be reduced by appropriate 
policies. In general, it is easier to identify activities, which stand to suffer 
economic costs compared to those which may benefit, and the economic costs are 
more immediate, more concentrated and more certain. Under mitigation policies, 
coal, possibly oil and gas, and certain energy-intensive sectors, such as steel 
production, are most likely to suffer an economic disadvantage. Other industries 
including renewable energy industries and services can be expected to benefit in 
the long term from price changes and the availability of financial and other 
resources that would otherwise have been devoted to carbon-intensive sectors. 
Policies such as the removal of subsidies from fossil fuels may increase total 
societal benefits through gains in economic efficiency, while use of the Kyoto 
mechanisms could be expected to reduce the net economic cost of meeting Annex B 
targets. Other types of policies, for example exempting carbon-intensive 
industries, redistribute the costs but increase total societal costs at the same 
time. Most studies show that the distributional effects of a carbon tax can have 
negative income effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues are used 
directly or indirectly to compensate such effects (Section <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/356.htm#921">9.2.1</A>).</P>
<P><A name=16></A>16. Emission constraints in Annex I countries have well 
established, albeit varied &#8220;spillover&#8221; effects <A

onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>18</SUP></SMALL></A> 
on non-Annex I countries (Sections <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/343.htm">8.3.2</A>, <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/373.htm">9.3</A>).<BR></P>
<UL>
  <LI>Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries: Analyses report costs differently, 
  including, inter alia, reductions in projected GDP and reductions in projected 
  oil revenues <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>19</SUP></SMALL></A>. 
  The study reporting the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of projected GDP 
  with no emissions trading, and less than 0.05% of projected GDP with Annex B 
  emissions trading in 2010 <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>20</SUP></SMALL></A>. 
  The study reporting the highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected oil 
  revenues with no emissions trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues with 
  Annex B emissions trading in 2010. These studies do not consider policies and 
  measures <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>21</SUP></SMALL></A> 
  other than Annex B emissions trading, that could lessen the impact on 
  non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the 
  costs to these countries and overall costs. </LI></UL>
<P>The effects on these countries can be further reduced by removal of subsidies 
for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content, 
increased use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex 
I, oil-exporting countries.<BR></P>
<UL>
  <LI>Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected by reductions 
  in demand for their exports to OECD nations and by the price increase of those 
  carbon-intensive and other products they continue to import. These countries 
  may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased exports of 
  carbon-intensive products and the transfer of environmentally sound 
  technologies and know-how. The net balance for a given country depends on 
  which of these factors dominates. Because of these complexities, the breakdown 
  of winners and losers remains uncertain. 
  <LI>Carbon leakage <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/Footnote" 
  onclick='window.open("fnspm.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><SMALL><SUP>22</SUP></SMALL></A>. 
  The possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-Annex I 
  countries and wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices may 
  lead to leakage in the order of 5%-20% (Section <A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg3/344.htm#8322">8.3.2.2</A>). Exemptions, 
  for example for energy-intensive industries, make the higher model estimates 
  for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate costs. The transfer of 
  environmentally sound technologies and know-how, not included in models, may 
  lead to lower leakage and especially on the longer term may more than offset 
  the leakage. </LI></UL><!-- #EndEditable -->
