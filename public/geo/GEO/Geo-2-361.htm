<H3>National Overview </H3>
<P><IMG height=50 src="geo-2-361_files/therm.gif" width=50> 1997… warm in the 
west and north but cool in the east. The national average temperature for 1997 
(January through December), based on preliminary data, was warmer than normal 
overall, at 0.7 degree above the long-term average. Spatially-averaged annual 
temperatures were warmer than normal, in a pattern very similar to that of the 
autumn just past, providing further evidence of the impacts of the continuing <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/elnino/index.html">El Nino</A> drama currently 
playing itself out in the equatorial Pacific. On average, over 90% of the 
Canadian land area experienced above-normal temperatures in 1997. 
Annually-averaged temperatures were about a degree warmer than normal in western 
Canada, from the Pacific Coast to the Prairie Provinces, and about two degrees 
warmer than normal in the north from northern British Columbia/Yukon Territory 
to the Mackenzie District of Northwest Territories. Across the Arctic Tundra to 
Baffin Island in the east, it was about 0.7 degree warmer than normal for the 
year. In the south and east, from Ontario to the Atlantic Coast 
annually-averaged temperatures ranged from slightly below normal to about a half 
a degree below in Atlantic Canada. Nationally, 1997 ranks as the 9<SUP>th</SUP> 
warmest year (42<SUP>nd</SUP> coldest) in the 50 years since <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual97/ttabna10.htm">comparable 
temperature records began in 1948</A>. A positive national temperature trend of 
0.5 degree continues over the 50-year period of analysis. Nationally, 
temperatures have been above-normal in 7 of the last 10 years (1989, 1990 and 
1992 were below), and similarly above in 13 of the last 20 since 1978. The 
warmest year nationally since 1948 continues to be 1981 (+2.0 degrees) and the 
coldest continues to be 1972 (-1.8 degrees). The <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual97/tchtseas.htm">consecutive 
seasons graph</A> shows that, nationally, so far in the 1990s, temperatures have 
been warmer than normal in over 60% of all seasons with springs and summers 
tending to be warm and winters and autumns tending to be cool. Exceptions abound 
of course, such as for example, the mild autumn of 1994 followed by the warm 
winter of 1994/95, and the "dreadful" summer of 1992 which will be remembered 
for its lack of warmth across most of the country.</P>

<P><IMG height=50 src="geo-2-361_files/rain.gif" width=50> 1997… wet in British 
Columbia and the north but dry on the prairies and in the east. The national 
average precipitation for 1997, based on preliminary data, was slightly wetter 
than normal overall, at about 3% above the long-term average. Spatially averaged 
annual precipitation was above normal throughout much of Canada (in a little 
over 50% of the Canadian land area) including the high Arctic Islands, the Yukon 
Territory, all of British Columbia, and from the Mackenzie Valley to the Ungava 
Peninsula. The heavy precipitation amounts received along coastal British 
Columbia in December are consistent with the late autumn-early winter 
precipitation impacts of the <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/elnino/index.html">El Nino</A> event. 
Elsewhere it was drier than normal from the prairies to Ontario and Quebec and 
to the east coast. Nationally, 1997 ranks as the 14<SUP>th</SUP> wettest 
(37<SUP>th</SUP> driest), since <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual97/ptabna10.htm">comparable 
precipitation records began in 1948</A>. It should be kept in mind, however, 
that "normal" precipitation in northern Canada is generally much less than it is 
in southern Canada, and hence a percentage departure in the north represents 
much less actual precipitation than the same percentage departure in the south. 
The national precipitation rankings are therefore often skewed by the northern 
departures, and do not represent the rankings for the volume of water falling on 
the country. For the nation as a whole, 8 of the last 10 years have been wetter 
than normal (1992 and 1995 were drier), and in the past 20 years since 1978, 18 
years have all been wetter than normal (exceptions again were 1992 and 1995). On 
a national basis since 1948, the wettest year continues to be 1996 (+11%) and 
the driest continues to be 1956 (-7%). Nationally, 1997 continues a period of 
wetter than normal seasons with nearly 70% of all seasons in the 1990s being 
wetter than normal as shown in the <A 
href="http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual97/pchtseas.htm">consecutive 
seasons graph.</A> During the 1990s Canadian winters have tended to be on the 
dry side overall, especially in 1993, 1994 and 1995. </P>
