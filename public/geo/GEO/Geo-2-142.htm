<P><I><B>Groundwater is an important source of drinking water for more than half 
of the nation's population and nearly all its rural population. In recent years, 
widespread reports of bacteria, nitrate, synthetic organic chemicals and other 
pollutants in groundwater have increased public concern about the quality of 
groundwater. What do we know - and what don't we know - about groundwater 
quality? What causes groundwater contamination, and to what extent are the 
nation's groundwater supplies at risk?</B></I> </P>
<HR SIZE=4>

<H2>How Much Do We Depend on Groundwater?</H2>
<P>According to 1985 U.S. figures, groundwater provides an estimated: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>22 percent of all freshwater withdrawals 
  <LI>53 percent of drinking water for the total population and 97 percent of 
  drinking water for the rural population 
  <LI>40 percent of public water supply withdrawals 
  <LI>46 percent of domestic and commercial use 
  <LI>24 percent of industrial and mining use 
  <LI>34 percent of agricultural use (mostly for irrigation) </LI></UL>
<H2>How Susceptible Groundwater to Contamination</H2>
<P>About one-fourth of the average 4.2 trillion gallons of precipitation that 
falls each day on the conterminous United States infiltrates the soil and 
recharges local aquifers, the sediments and roeks that store and transport 
groundwater. In general, shallow, permeable water table aquifers are the most 
susceptible to contamination, but susceptibility of all aquifers to 
contamination is determined largely by such site-specific characteristics as: 
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>distance from the contamination source to the aquifer and residence time 
  of the water in the unsaturated zone; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>presence of clay and organic matter in the unsaturated zone materials; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>potential of a particular contaminant to biodegrade and decompose; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>amount of precipitation, which affects recharge and the rate at whieh 
  contaminants move downward; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>evapotranspiration, which in recharge areas may decrease the amount of 
  water that moves downward to the aquifer. </LI></UL>
<H2>What Causes Groundwater Contamination</H2>
<H3>Natural Sources</H3>
<P>Groundwater contamination can occur in many ways and from many sources, both 
natural- and human-induced. Groundwater commonly contains one or more naturally 
ocourring chemicals, leached from soil or rocks by percolating water, in 
concentrations that exceed federal or state drinking water standards or 
otherwise impair its use. </P>
<H4>Dissolved Solids and Chloride</H4>
<P>One of the most common water quality concerns is the presence of dissolved 
solids and chloride in concentrations that exceed the recommended maximum limits 
in federal secondary drinking water standards: 500 mg/L (milligrams per liter or 
approximately equivalent to parts per million) for dissolved solids and 250 mg/L 
for chloride. Such concentrations are found at the seaward ends of all coastal 
aquifers and are quite common in aquifers at depths greater than a few hundred 
feet below the land surface in many parts of the United States. </P>
<H4>Iron and Manganese</H4>
<P>Although not partieularly toxic, iron and manganese in concentrations greater 
than the limits for federal secondary drinking water standards (0.3 mg/L for 
iron and 0.05 mg/L for manganese) can impair the taste of water; stain plumbing 
fixtures, glassware and laundry; and form encrustrations on well screens, 
thereby reducing well-pumping efficiency. </P>
<H4>Nitrate-Nitrogen</H4>
<P>Most groundwater not affected by human activity contains less than 10 mg/L 
nitrate-nitrogen, the maximum concentration allowed by federal primary drinking 
water standards. Nationwide, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of less than 0.2 
mg/L generally represent natural conditions, whereas values greater than 3 mg/L 
may indicate the effects of human activities. </P>
<P>Although relatively nontoxic, nitrate may be reduced by bacteria to nitrite 
in the intestines of newbom infants and cause the disease methemoglobinemia. 
Nitrate also can react with amines in the human body to form N-nitrosamines, 
careinogenic chemicals known to induce tumors in laboratory animals and thought 
to be linked to human cancers. </P>
<H3>Human Activities</H3>
<P>Contaminants can enter groundwater from more than 30 different generic 
sources related to human activities. These sources commonly are referred to as 
either point or nonpoint sources. Point sources are localized in areas of an 
acre or less, whereas nonpoint sources are dispersed over broad areas. </P>
<P>The most common sources of human-induced groundwater contamination can be 
grouped into four categories: waste disposal practiees; storage and handling of 
materials and wastes; agricultural activities; and saline water intrusion. </P>
<H4>Waste Disposal Practices</H4>
<P>Perhaps the best-known sources of groundwater contamination are associated 
with the storage or disposal of liquid and solid wastes. The organic substances 
most frequently reported in groundwater as resulting from waste disposal in 
decreasing order of occurrence, are: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>trichloroethylene (TCE) 
  <LI>chloroform 
  <LI>benzene 
  <LI>pentachlorophenol 
  <LI>tetrachloroethylene (PCE) 
  <LI>creosote 
  <LI>phenolic compounds 
  <LI>l,l,l-trichloroethane 
  <LI>toluene 
  <LI>xylene </LI></UL>
<P>Waste disposal can take a number of forms: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>septic systems 
  <LI>municipal and industrial landfills 
  <LI>surface impoundments 
  <LI>waste-injection wells 
  <LI>direct application of stabilized wastes to the land </LI></UL>
<P>In addition to these regulated forms of disposal, a considerable amount of 
unregulated disposal, such as illegal dumping and accidental spills, contributes 
to groundwater contamination. </P>
<H4>Septic Systems</H4>
<P>Septic systems are the largest source by volume of waste discharged to the 
land. These systems are sources of bacteria, viruses, nitrate, phosphorus, 
chloride and organic substances, including organic solvents such as 
trichloroethylene that are sold commercially to "clean" the systems. </P>
<P>In 1980, about 22 million domestic disposal systems were in operation, and 
about one-half million new systems are installed each year. It is estimated that 
from one-third to one-half of existing systems eould be operating improperly 
because of poor location, design, construction or maintenance practices. </P>
<P>Even when Operating properly, systems ean be spaced so densely that their 
discharge exceeds the capacity of the local soil to assimilate the pollutant 
loads. Because the 10- to 15-year design life of many septic systems built 
during the 1960s and 1970s is now exceeded, groundwater contamination caused by 
septic system failure probably will increase in the future. </P>
<H4>Landfills</H4>
<P>About 150 million tons of municipal solid waste and 240 million tons of 
industrial solid waste are deposited in 16,400 landfills each year. Some 
hazardous waste material may be deposited in municipal landfills and underlying 
groundwater may become contaminated. Wastes deposited at industrial landfills 
inelude a large assortment of trace metals, acids, volatile organie eompounds 
and peticides, which may eause signifieant local contamination. </P>
<H4>Surface impoundments</H4>
<P>Surface impoundments are used to store, treat or dispose of oil and gas 
brines, acidic mine wastes, industrial wastes (mainly liquids), animal wastes, 
municipal treatment plant sludges and cooling water. For the most part, these 
impoundments eontain nonhazardous wastes; however, hazardous wastes are known to 
be treated, stored and disposed of by 400 facilities involving about 3,200 
impoundments. Some of these impoundments have significant potential for 
contaminating groundwater. </P>
<H4>Injection Wells</H4>
<P>In some parts of the country, injection wells dispose of liquid wastes 
underground. Of paticular concern is the widespread use of drainage wells to 
dispose of urban stormwater runoff and irrigation drainage. Contaminants 
associated with drainage wells include suspended sediments; dissolved solids; 
baeteria; sodium; chloride; nitrate; phosphate; lead, and organic compounds, 
including pesticides. </P>
<H4>Land Application of Wastes</H4>
<P>In many places, solid and liquid wastes are placed or sprayed on the land, 
commonly after treatment and stabilization. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) has estimated that more than 7 million dry tons of sludge from at 
least 2,463 publicly owned waste treatment plants are applied to about 11,900 
parcels of land each year. Contamination can occur from improper land-disposal 
techniques. </P>
<H3>Storage and Handling of Materials and Wastes</H3>
<P>Groundwater contamination as the result of storage and handling of materials 
includes leaks from both above-ground and underground storage tanks, as well as 
unintentional spills or poor housekeeping practices in the handling and 
transfering of materials on industrial and commercial sites. </P>
<H4>Leaking Underground Storage Tanks</H4>
<P>Possibly as many as 7 million steel tanks are used to store petroleum 
products, acids, chemicals, industrial solvents and other types of waste 
underground. The potential of these tanks to leak increases with age. About 20 
percent of existing steel tanks are more than 16 years old, and estimates of the 
total number that presently leak petroleum products range from 25 to 30 percent. 
Underground storage tanks appear to be a leading source of benzene, toluene and 
xylene contaminants, all of which are organic compounds in diesel and gasoline 
fuels. </P>
<H4>Transporting and Stockpiling</H4>
<P>Many materials and wastes are transported and then temporarily stored in 
stockpiles before being used or shipped elsewhere. Precipitation can leaeh 
potential contaminants from such stockpile; storage containers can eorrode and 
leak; and accidental spills ean oecur - as many as 10,000 to 16,000 per year, 
according to EPA estimates. </P>
<H4>Mining Practices</H4>
<P>Mining of coal, uranium and other substances and the related mine spoil can 
lead to groundwater contamination in several ways: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Shafts and tunnels can intersect aquifers. 
  <LI>Exposing coal to oxygen can form sulfuric acid, which can degrade water 
  quality. 
  <LI>Contaminants from tailings can leach into groundwater. </LI></UL>
<H4>Oil-Well Brines</H4>
<P>Since the 1800s, hundreds of thousands of exploratory and production wells 
have been drilled for oil and gas in the United States. During production, oil 
wells produce brines that are separated from the oil and stored in surface 
impoundments. EPA estimates that 125,100 brine-disposal impoundments exist that 
might affect local groundwater supplies. </P>
<H3>Agricultural Activities</H3>
<P>Agriculture is one of the most widespread human activities that affects the 
quality of groundwater. In 1987, about 330 million acres were used for growing 
crops in the United States, of which 45 million acres were irrigated. </P>
<H4>Fertilizers</H4>
<P>During the 1960s and 1970s, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer use 
steadily increased to a peak of 23 million tons in 1981. By 1987, however, 
fertilizer use had declined to 19.2 million tons, reflecting the large number of 
acres withdrawn from production as part of the Conservation Reserve Program and 
other government programs. </P>
<P>If nitrogen supply exceeds nitrogen uptake by crops, excess nitrogen ean be 
leached to groundwater. In such areas, local nitrate-nitrogen concentrations may 
exceed the federal drinking water standard of 10 mg/L </P>
<H4>Pesticides</H4>
<P>Pesticides have been used since the 1940s to combat a variety of agricultural 
pests. Between 1964 and 1982, the amount of active ingredients applied to 
croplands increased 170 pereent. Herbicide usage peaked in 1982, and since then 
has declined from about 500 million pounds of active ingredients per year to 
about 430 million pounds in 1987. </P>
<P>In addition to crop applications, infiltration of spilled pesticides can 
cause contamination in locations where pesticides are stored, and where sprayers 
and other equipment used to apply pesticides are loaded and washed. </P>
<P>Pesticides most frequently detected in groundwater are the fumigants ethylene 
dibromide (EDB) and 1,2-dichloropropane; the insecticides aldicarb, carbofuran 
and chlordane; and the herbieides alachlor and atrazine. </P>
<H4>Feedlots</H4>
<P>Feedlots confine livestock and poultry and create problems of animal-waste 
disposal. Feedlot wastes often are collected in impoundments from which they 
might infiltrate to groundwater and raise nitrate concentrations. Runoff from 
farmyards may also directly enter an aquifer along the outside of a poorly 
sealed well easing. </P>
<H4>Irrigation</H4>
<P>Percolation of irrigation water into soils dissolves soil salts and 
transports them downward. Evapotranspiration of applied water from the root zone 
concentrates salts in the soil and increases the salt load to the groundwater. 
</P>
<P>Chemigation, the practice of mixing and distributing pesticides and 
fertilizers with irrigation water, may cause contamination if more chemicals are 
applied than crops can use. lt may also cause local contamination if chemicals 
back-siphon from the holding tank directly into the aquifer through an 
irrigation well. </P>
<H4>Saline Water Intrusion</H4>
<P>The encroachment of saline water into the freshwater part of an aquifer is an 
ever-present threat when water supplies are developed from the highly productive 
coastal plain aquifers of the United States, or from aquifers underlain by 
saline water in the interior of the country. Local incidents of saline water 
intrusion have occurred on all coasts of the United States. </P>
<H2>How Extensive is Groundwater Contamination</H2>
<P>Assessment of the extent of groundwater contamination is difficult, due to 
such factors as limited and inconsistent access to the water (usually dependent 
on wells and springs); the potential for bias in existing data (if originally 
collected to explore a particular water quality problem); incomplete information 
about the well (did the well draw from more than one aquifer?); and inconsistent 
methods of sampling and analysis. </P>
<P>It is also important to keep in mind that the trend of increasing reports of 
detections of contaminants in groundwater is largely due to the intensive search 
for contaminants now under way by many state agencies, as well as continued 
improvements in the sensitivity of analytical methods used to measure the 
concentration of contaminants. </P>
<P>The volume of groundwater within 2500 feet of the surface has been estimated 
at 100 quadrillion gallons, or about 16 times the volume of the Great Lakes. Of 
this amount, at least half is too saline from natural causes to use for drinking 
water, although some of it may be suitable for other uses. The total amount of 
the remaining groundwater that is contaminated is unknown, although EPA 
estimates the amount contaminated by point sources to be 2-3 percent. </P>
<P>Recent U.S. Geological Suney studies have made the following assessments: 
</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>The United States has large amounts of potable water available for use. 
  Locally, however, high concentrations of a variety of toxic metals, organic 
  chemicals and petroleum products form plumes around such point sources as 
  leaking underground storage tanks, waste disposal sites and chemical or waste 
  handling areas. These types of problems generally occur in urban or 
  industrialized areas, although they are found occasionally in rural areas. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Large regions have been identified in which contaminants, derived from 
  nonpoint sources and often at minimum detectable levels, are present in many 
  shallow wells throughout a given area. In a small percentage of wells, such 
  contaminants as nitrate may exceed drinking water standards or health 
  advisories. Generally, such nonpoint source contamination is associated with 
  densely populated urban areas, agricultural land uses and concentrations of 
  septic systems. Furthermore, such contamination commonly affects only the 
  shallowest aquifers. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>20 percent of 124,000 wells sampled over the past 25 years contained a 
  maximum nitrate-nitrogen concentration greater than 3 mg/L, suggesting the 
  effects of human activities.6 percent of the samples exceeded the federal 
  drinking water standard for nitrate-nitrogen of 10 mg/L. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Although 44 state summaries in the U.S. Geological Survey's 1986 National 
  Water Summary on groundwater quality mention detection of pesticides in 
  groundwater, data are insufficient to draw conclusions about the extent of 
  contamination. The state summaries do, however, express widespread concern 
  that the frequency of detections and the concentrations of pesticides will 
  increase over time. </LI></UL>
<P>The U.S. EPA has compiled reports on the ocourrence of 46 pesticides in 
groundwater. In 26 states, one or more pesticides have been deteeted in 
groundwater that ean be attributed to normal agricultural use. The most commonly 
detected pesticides are atrazine and aldicarb. </P>
<P>EPA currently is conducting its National Pesticide Survey to provide a 
nationwide estimate of the occurrenee of pesticides in drinking water wells. The 
survey includes the collection of water samples from a statistically 
representative sample of community water system wells (600) and private wells 
(750). </P>
<P>Interim results show that 6 of 180 community well samples collected thus far 
and 9 of 115 private well samples had detectable pesticide residues. Of the 15 
wells that had detectable levels of pesticides,3 had concentrations that 
exceeded lifetime health advisory levels established by EPA. Of 295 wells 
sampled thus far, samples from 8 wells had nitrate-nitrogen concentrations that 
exceeded the 10 mg/L drinking water standard. All 8 samples were from private 
wells. Statistically reliable estimates of the percentage of wells containated 
will be available when the survey results are released in late 1990. </P>
<H2>Summary: How Contaminated is Groundwater?</H2>
<P>Although little systematic information exists on the extent and severity of 
groundwater contamination, available evidence suggests that: </P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>The shallowest aquifers generally are at greatest risk of contamination, 
  especially those where the overlying unsaturated zone is thin and permeable. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Contamination of shallow aquifers by nitrates and synthetic organic 
  chemicals is widespread in many areas; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Shallow groundwater contamination can be related to land use. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>As yet, deeper aquifers, which commonly are used for public drinking water 
  supplies, are relatively free from contamination. </LI></UL>
<P>Additional reports of groundwater contamination may be expected in the coming 
years, as federal, state and local agencies expand their groundwater quality 
monitoring programs using sophisticated analytical methods that can measure very 
small concentrations of contaminants. Groundwater moves very slowly, and it may 
be years after remedial actions are taken before improvements in water quality 
are obsened. For this reason, the enhancement of the quality of the nation's 
groundwater requires a long-term commitment. </P>
<P>More definitive assessments of groundwater quality will have to await the 
expansion of data-collection programs, the use of standard sampling and 
analytical procedures, research on the health risks associated wtih long-term 
exposure to very small concentrations of contaminants, and improvements in the 
computer models used to predict contaminant behavior. </P>
<P>Although current assessments of groundwater quality are far from definitive, 
they do suggest the widespread presence of shallow groundwater contamination. 
While we have much yet to learn about the sources and extent of contamination, 
the general principles and steps needed to protect groundwater from future 
contamination are well understood. Reductions of wastes, control of 
contamination sources and improved land management practices can significantly 
reduce the risk of contamination in the future. </P>
