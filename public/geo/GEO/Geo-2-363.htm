      <H1>Introduction</H1>
      <P><FONT color=#3300cc size=+2>The flood was forty days upon the earth; 
      and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the 
      earth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The waters prevailed exceedingly upon the

      covered.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <P align=right><FONT color=#3300cc size=-1>— <I>Genesis, 
      7</I></FONT></FONT> 
      <P>The Old Testament story of Noah and his ark is merely one of many told 
      down through the ages. In both Western and Eastern civilizations, people 
      have recounted legends of floods engulfing the entire earth. Only in 
      Africa is the flood story rarely told. Scholars have argued for centuries 
      about the origins of these stories, their commonality, and whether such 
      cataclysms ever occurred. Nonetheless, although the extent of these floods 
      is uncertain, their violent nature is vividly portrayed. The stories, of 
      course, are told in terms of how floods affect people's lives. They 
      reflect public perception which sees widespread human and material losses 
      in the flood's wake. 
      <P>[<A href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/en/manage/floodgen/e_noah.htm">News 
      Clip&nbsp;- Noah's Flood Really Happened</A>] 
      <P>Viewed in terms of the global ecosystem, however, flooding is part of 
      the hydrologic cycle in which water is forever recycled between the earth 
      and the atmosphere. Spilling over the floodplain, water nourishes the 
      wetlands of Canada's major deltas. For instance, the recurrent inundation 
      of the Peace&shy;Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta has fostered an 
      environment in which plant and animal life has achieved a balance 
      dependent on flooding. 
      <P>Flooding is a common phenomenon in Canada, resulting from an increase 
      in streamflow beyond the point where the normal stream channel can contain 
      the water. When water overspills riverbanks, it spreads out along the 
      adjoining floodplain. Flood&shy;waters may occupy the floodplain for a 
      matter of hours, as in the case of flash floods, or for up to two months, 
      as sometimes occurs during the spring snowmelt runoff period. 
      <P><A 
      href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/water/images/manage/floodgen/e-111.gif"><IMG 
      align=baseline alt="The floodplain - 25KB" border=0 height=32 
      src="geo-2-363_files/graphic.gif" width=32></A> The floodplain, a level 
      expanse carved out by the river, is a natural extension of the river 
      channel. In spite of potential peril, people are drawn to the area because 
      of the many benefits the floodplain provides. Unfortunately, this use of 
      the floodplain generally does not make accommodation for the river's 
      eventual return. As the development of floodplains continues, conflicts 
      with many ecological processes increase. The marshes and swamps of the 
      floodplains provide required habitat for numerous species of fish and 
      wildlife. As well, these areas act as filters for the river system and 
      allow the recharging of groundwater supplies. When floodplains are 
      developed, marshes and swamps are drained and low&shy;lying areas filled 
      in. 
      <P>Since earliest time people have lived along the edge of rivers and 
      lakes. Apart from the obvious source of drinking water, the river 
      supported a food source, provided a means of transportation, and 
      eventually supplied power to mills. People have continued to occupy the 
      floodplain but for different reasons. The floodplain and riverbank provide 
      aesthetically pleasing sites for housing, the level land is cheaper to 
      build on, and services are easier to install. 
      <P>As the development of the floodplains increased, concurrently the 
      damage caused by flooding also increased. Therefore protective measures 
      such as dykes, dams and diversions have been widely employed. 
      <P>Although structures may successfully protect areas, they also can 
      engender a false sense of security. Often development continues in the 
      floodplain after the structural approach has apparently solved the flood 
      problem. However, structures are not infallible. They require maintenance, 
      particularly dykes, which can be eroded over time or become saturated and 
      fail during extended periods of high flow. No matter to what level of 
      flooding structures are designed, there may come a time when the flood 
      levels will exceed the <I>design flood</I>. Whatever the reason, once the 
      structural system fails, the damage from the flooding will be greater than 
      if the structures had never been put in place.

      <P>
      <H3>The flood regime</H3>
      <P>Given the proper conditions, every river has reaches that have the 
      potential to flood. Across Canada, flooding is a common event because 
      these conditions are met regularly. Although flooding is generally 
      perceived to be associated with the spring runoff, floods have been known 
      to occur at any time of the year. Other causes of flooding include storms 
      and ice jams. While many floods are due to one cause, the most severe 
      floods tend to result from the compounding influences of two or more 
      causes, such as a heavy rainfall together with the spring snowmelt runoff. 

      <P>Although people generally think of floods in terms of damage to 
      property and loss of life, floods can benefit the natural environment and 
      sustain many ecosystems. <PRE></PRE><!--END OF VARIABLE INFO-->
