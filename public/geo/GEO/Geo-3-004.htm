            <P><B>(03/11/2002) Dirty little secrets: Almost 1/3 of all 
            factories, power plants and other major sources of air pollution in 
            the U.S. still do not have the permits required under the 1970 Clean 
            Air Act, leaving many of the worst polluters unregulated.</B> Across 
            the U.S., almost one third of all factories, power plants and other 
            major sources of air pollution still do not have the permits 
            required under the Clean Air Act of 1970. The poor rate of 
            compliance is detailed in agency documents released by Public 
            Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). As a consequence, 
            many of the nation's worst air polluters are shielded from both 
            regulatory control and public scrutiny, according to PEER, a 
            nonprofit organization of government employees, including 
            scientists, land managers, law enforcement officers, and other 
            environmental professionals. 
            <P>Despite a 1997 statutory deadline for issuance of all permits for 
            facilities that are major sources of air pollution, the failure of 
            the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its state counterparts 
            to require permits for these air polluters "has remained an open 
            secret in agency circles," PEER said. 
            <P>According to an October 2001 draft report from EPA's Office of 
            Inspector General that was never made public, the absence of 
            operating permits undermines monitoring, enforcement and pollution 
            prevention. "The Clean Air Act must be implemented before it can be 
            expected to work," said Kyla Bennett, a former EPA attorney who is 
            director of New England PEER. "The poor track records for the 
            industrial New England states of Massachusetts, Connecticut and 
            Rhode Island should be setting off alarm bells."

              </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The air pollution is emitted from 
            factories and power plants that burn fossil fuels - coal, oil and 
            gas. Several of the Eastern industrial states with the worst air 
            pollution problems have the lowest rates of permit issuance, the 
            agency documents revealed. New Jersey has permitted only 30 percent 
            of its major sources; Massachusetts has permitted only 32 percent. 
            Regionally, New England has the lowest rate, at only 41 percent, 
            while the Rocky Mountain region has highest rate of 91 percent. 
            <P>A December 4, 2001 statement of priorities distributed by Jeffrey 
            Holmstead, head of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, assessed the 
            inability to meet statutory deadlines in the stationary source 
            program - referred to as Title V of the Clean Air Act. "We're more 
            than 10 years into the Title V program," Holmstead wrote, "yet only 
            about two-thirds of the major sources in the country have received 
            their Title V permits. And most of the largest, most complex sources 
            remain unpermitted and are operating under the so-called application 
            shield." 
            <P>Under the application shield, polluters are allowed to operate if 
            they have applied for a permit; a process that the EPA Inspector 
            General estimates takes an average of 3.2 years. The EPA predicts 
            that it may close the gap in permit issuance by 2004, at the 
            earliest. However, Bush changed the rules on February 14, 2002, when 
            he announced a new, industry-supported air pollution control scheme 
            that would instead establish a so-called market based cap-and-trade 
            approach. 
            <P>But the first step taken by the administration towards a 
            cap-and-trade approach - the approval of open market air pollution 
            trading authority for states - has been challenged by PEER and the 
            Sierra Club, who have filed complaints charging that the air 
            pollution trading authority for states violates the Clean Air Act to 
            the detriment of public health. The joint PEER/Sierra Club 
            complaints ask first that enforcement action be taken against New 
            Jersey companies who have used credits to circumvent Clean Air Act 
            requirements without legal authorization; and also that the EPA 
            Office of Inspector General review the effectiveness and legality of 
            pollution trading schemes. 
            <P>Testifying before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public 
            Works November 1, 2001, Holmstead acknowledged that an "effective" 
            market based approach would make some existing provisions of the 
            Clean Air Act unnecessary. For example, he said, depending on the 
            ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress, cap-and-trade legislation 
            that creates a market for emissions credits would eliminate the need 
            for "best available retrofit technology" requirements, "maximum 
            achievable control technology" to reduce mercury emissions, and "new 
            source review case-by-case technology requirements for power 
            generators," all requirements that have been fought by industry. (<A

            <P><B>(03/11/2002) Study shows breathing air contaminated with 
            pollutants from car and truck exhaust at levels commonly found in 
            urban areas narrows blood vessels in even healthy people, possibly 
            explaining why rate of heart attacks increases with exposure to air 
            pollution.</B> Even in healthy people, breathing air contaminated 
            with pollutants found in car and truck exhaust causes blood vessels 
            to constrict, according to the first study of its kind. The study 
            fits in with other research that shows air pollution can cause not 
            only breathing problems, but also heart problems. The findings may 
            explain why people with cardiovascular disease seem to be 
            particularly susceptible to poor air quality, researchers say. The 
            U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that air pollution 
            contributed to 60,000 heart-related deaths in 1996.

            that environmentally relevant concentrations of common air 
            pollutants that can occur in urban settings adversely affects the 
            blood vessels of healthy people," says study author Robert D. Brook, 
            MD, assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of 
            Michigan at Ann Arbor. "Breathing common urban air pollution, which 
            is on the rise globally due to world-wide industrialization, clearly 
            has an adverse impact on the proper functioning of blood vessels, of 
            even the healthiest of individuals." 
            <P>"There is a lot of epidemiological data saying that air pollution 
            is associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes, 
            but there is still a lack of understanding as to how the association 
            occurs physiologically," Brook said, a specialist in the biology of 
            blood vessels. "These findings suggest a possible reason why the 
            rate of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events increases with 
            exposure to air pollution for people with known heart and blood 
            vessel disease." 
            <P>Brook said the harmful pollution could not be seen or smelled, 
            and people would not feel the effects. "You don't even know. You 
            can't tell that you are inhaling it. You can breathe in these rather 
            high levels of air pollution and be mostly unaware," Brook said. 
            <P>The researchers focused on ozone and fine particulate matter. 
            Fine particles are those with a diameter of less than 2.5 
            micrometers. Fine particles are emitted from burning fossil fuels, 
            mostly from car engine exhaust, power generation and many industrial 
            processes. Ozone and additional particulate materials are created 
            when the sun shines on these emissions. 
            <P>"These come from the combustion of normal fossil fuel," Brook 
            said. Cars, power plants, iron smelters and other industry all 
            create ozone and fine particulate pollution. 
            <P>"In other research, exposure to fine particles has been 
            implicated in coronary events such as heart attacks," Brook 
            explains. "In contrast to larger particles, which are trapped in the 
            upper airways when inhaled, the fine particles travel down to the 
            alveoli, tiny air sacs at the base of the lungs, where they can 
            affect the rest of the cardiovascular system by adversely impacting 
            circulating blood. It is possible that the particles may even 
            directly enter the blood." 
            <P>The tiny particles of carbon and other material have even smaller 
            bits of iron, manganese and zinc clinging to them. They are inhaled 
            deep into the lungs and some studies suggest they may be absorbed 
            directly into the bloodstream. These bits of metal may also damage 
            healthy cells. 
            <P>Brook said the body's immune system may mistake smog particles 
            for bacterial or viral invaders, and attack. As white blood cell 
            move in, they release inflammatory chemicals called cytokines that 
            cause the blood vessels to constrict. 
            <P>Twenty-five healthy volunteers with an average age of 35 inhaled 
            air with concentrations of particulate matter of 150 micrograms per 
            cubic meter and 120 parts per billion of ozone for 2 hours. These 
            concentrations are similar to those found in the air during 
            rush-hour traffic in large cities, Brook noted. 
            <P>After two hours of breathing the polluted air, the blood vessels 
            of the volunteers constricted between 2 percent and 4 percent on 
            average, Brook and his team reported in the journal Circulation. 
            Their vessels did not constrict when they breathed clean, filtered 
            air. The researchers used ultrasound to measure the diameter of the 
            brachial artery, which runs from the shoulder to the elbow. 
            <P>"Although the degree of constriction in and of itself is unlikely 
            to produce significant problems in healthy individuals, such a 
            constriction could conceivably trigger cardiac events in those 
            individuals who have or are at risk for heart disease," Brook said. 
            <P>Brooks said his study fit in well with one published last week in 
            the Journal of the American Medical Association, in which a team at 
            Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, found that long-term 
            exposure to air pollution increases the risk of death from lung 
            cancer, heart attack, stroke, asthma, pneumonia, emphysema and 
            chronic bronchitis. 
            <P>"We are hoping that this line of research will add some strength 
            to well-known association studies," Brook said. "Now we can say 
            'gee, there is a clear linkage here between bad air and 
            cardiopulmonary events."' (<A

            <P><B>(03/05/2002) Major new study provides "compelling" evidence 
            that air pollution in many U.S. cities raises the risk of 
            cardiopulmonary diseases, including lung cancer, heart attack, 
            stroke, asthma, pneumonia, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as much 
            as living with a smoker.</B> Long-term exposure to the levels of air 
            pollution common in many of America's metropolitan areas 
            significantly increases the risk of dying from lung cancer and other 
            lung and heart diseases, and is about as dangerous as living with a 
            smoker, a study of a half-million people has found. The increased 
            risk comes from what scientists call combustion-related fine 
            particulate matter soot emitted by cars and trucks, coal-fired power 
            plants and factories.

            provide the strongest evidence to date that long-term exposure to 
            fine particulate air pollution common to many metropolitan areas is 
            an important risk factor for cardiopulmonary mortality," researchers 
            from Brigham Young University said. The study included heart attack, 
            stroke, asthma, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
            diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis under the category of 
            cardiopulmonary diseases. Exposure to high levels of particulate air 
            pollution - tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs - 
            and sulfur oxide-related pollution were linked to a higher risk of 
            death from these illnesses, as well as death from any cause. Both 
            types of pollution are produced by combustion, such as burning of 
            gas by automobile engines and fuel burning at power plants. 
            <P>"Elevated fine particulate air pollution exposures were 
            associated with significant increases in lung cancer mortality," the 
            researchers added. 
            <P>"This means, over the long run, your lungs and heart are 
            experiencing damage equal to what you would get if you were living 
            with a smoker, even if you are not," says study co-author George D. 
            Thurston. 
            <P>Professor Arden Pope, a co-author of the study from Bingham Young 
            University: "We found the risk of dying from lung cancer as well as 
            heart disease in the most polluted cities was comparable to the risk 
            associated with non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke over 
            a long period." 
            <P>Lung cancer is one of the hardest cancers to treat. For example, 
            even with the latest drugs and treatments, only one in 10 people is 
            alive five years after diagnosis - and in many parts of the UK, the 
            survival rate is only half this or worse. As a result, although it 
            is not the most common cancer in the U.K., it kills far more people 
            than any other type. 
            <P>The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical 
            Association, confirms previous research and provides the strongest 
            evidence yet of the health dangers of the pollution levels found in 
            many big cities and even some smaller ones, according to the 
            researchers from Brigham Young University and New York University. 
            For example, someone living in heavily polluted Bakersfield or 
            Rubidoux, California faces a risk 20% greater than someone living in 
            Pueblo, Colorado. 
            <P>For years, air pollution cleanup has focused on ways to reduce 
            ozone, a gas that reduces respiratory function. Yet, more and more 
            studies implicate microscopic particles that form haze as a serious 
            health risk. While ozone levels are generally in decline nationwide, 
            progress against particle pollution has been more modest. 
            Significant sources include farm equipment, diesel trucks and buses 
            and portable generators. 
            <P>The most dangerous particles are the smallest specks, which can 
            float in the air for weeks, circumnavigate the globe and bypass the 
            body's defenses to lodge deep in the lungs. Those particles come 
            primarily from fossil fuel combustion, and some are formed when 
            emissions from power plants, factories and vehicles react with 
            sunlight to form microscopic bits. For example, when huge power 
            plants spew pollution into the air while burning coal, and sometimes 
            diesel fuel, to provide low-cost electricity for many suburban 
            areas, wind patterns carry it from places as far west as Ohio to 
            cities as far east as New York and Washington. Unfortunately, these 
            places already have air pollution problems due to vehicle exhaust 
            and factories. 
            <P>The study involved 500,000 adults who enrolled in 1982 in an 
            American Cancer Society survey on cancer prevention. The researchers 
            examined participants' health records through 1998 and analyzed data 
            on annual air pollution averages in the more than 100 cities in 
            which participants lived. The researchers first took into account 
            other risk factors for heart and lung disease such as cigarettes, 
            diet, weight and occupation. 
            <P>Lung cancer death rates were compared with average pollution 
            levels, as measured in micrograms per cubic meter of air. The 
            researchers found that every time the level of particulate matter 
            smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter increased by 10 micrograms 
            per cubic meter, there was approximately a 4%, 6% and 8% increased 
            risk of death from all causes, cardiopulmonary disease, and lung 
            cancer, respectively. Nationwide, as many as 30,100 deaths a year 
            are related to power plant emissions, according to another study by 
            Abt Associates, a private research organization that does work for 
            the EPA. In 1998, an influential British government committee on the 
            effects of air pollution suggested that 10,000 people a year might 
            be dying in the U.K. as a result of particulate pollution. 
            <P>Allen Dearry, a scientist at the National Institute of 
            Environmental Health Sciences, which funded the new study, called it 
            "the best epidemiologic evidence that we have so far that that type 
            of exposure is associated with lung cancer death." 
            <P>"What makes this study significant is that it involved hundreds 
            of thousands of people in cities across the country. And most 
            importantly, it gave us nearly two decades of follow-up, during 
            which time it continued to demonstrate a direct correlation between 
            this fine particulate air pollution and the risk of death from heart 
            and lung disease," said Dr. Joseph Cooke, associate director of the 
            Medical Intensive Care Unit at New York Weill Cornell Medical 
            Center. 
            <P>"This study is compelling because it involved hundreds of 
            thousands of people in many cities across the United States who were 
            followed for almost two decades," said Thurston, an NYU 
            environmental scientist. Thurston said the lung cancer risks were 
            virtually identical to those faced by nonsmokers who live with 
            smokers and are exposed long-term to secondhand cigarette smoke. 
            <P>Though doctors aren't exactly sure how the particles damage the 
            lungs and heart, the American Lung Association says small particles 
            are easily drawn into the alveoli, the smallest air sacs of the 
            lungs. Because the lung has trouble clearing foreign matter from 
            that deep within the system, the soot deposits remain. 
            <P>"The tiny particles are best able to defeat defense mechanisms of 
            our lungs," Thurston said. "The larger ones catch in our nose and 
            throat and we're able to clear them out, but fine combustion 
            particles can penetrate and bypass our defenses. Fine particles 
            contain the highest concentration of toxic material, heavy metals, 
            lead, arsenic and other cancer causing agents." 
            <P>In the early 1980s, when the study began, some major cities had 
            air pollution levels of 25 to 30 micrograms per cubic meter, which 
            would confer a more than 20 percent increased risk of lung cancer 
            mortality, said Pope. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set 
            average exposure limits at 15 micrograms per cubic meter in 1997, 
            when it tightened its standards to include fine particulate matter 
            pollutants measuring less than 2.5 micrometers (about 1/28th the 
            width of a human hair). But the rules have been held up by lawsuits 
            brought by the power industry and by vehicle manufacturers and 
            operators. 
            <P>The EPA's 1997 regulations followed a study linking fine 
            particulate pollution and lung cancer done on many of the same 
            participants by Pope, an environmental epidemiologist at Brigham 
            Young University. Pope said the new study doubles the follow-up time 
            and does a better job of taking other risk factors into account, to 
            address criticism from industry groups who challenged the earlier 
            study and sued the EPA over the 1997 regulations. The Supreme Court 
            upheld the tightened standards last year. 
            <P>Thurston said annual fine-particulate pollutant averages have 
            fallen since the early 1980s but as of 1999-2000 were still at or 
            above the EPA limit in such metropolitan areas as New York, 
            Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles. He said the biggest sources of 
            such pollution are coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and 
            East, and diesel trucks and buses in the West. 
            <P>Thurston said the study gives new impetus to efforts to clean up 
            aging coal-fired power plants. The efforts to clean up city air 
            stoke a political debate that revolves, in part, around huge power 
            plants that continue to burn coal, and sometimes diesel fuel, to 
            provide low-cost electricity for many suburban areas. When that 
            pollution is spewed into air, Thurston says, wind patterns carry it 
            from places as far west as Ohio to cities as far east as New York 
            and Washington. Unfortunately, these places are already compromised 
            by vehicle pollution. 
            <P>While newer plants are subject to clean air emissions laws passed 
            during the Clinton administration, Thurston said the older companies 
            are getting away with environmental murder, thanks to a 
            "grandfather" clause that exempts them from the new, higher 
            standards. 
            <P>The latest findings come as the Bush administration is 
            considering industry-supported proposals for rolling back government 
            legal action against dozens of aging "grandfathered" coal-fired 
            power plants and refineries that violated the law by expanding 
            without installing state of the art anti-pollution equipment. Power 
            plants built before 1980 generate about half the nation's 
            electricity but nearly all of the utility industry's unhealthy 
            sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and soot, experts said. 
            <P>Environmentalists, public health advocates and citizens groups 
            have long contended that power plant emissions have contributed to 
            an alarming rise in premature deaths and illness related to asthma, 
            bronchitis and other diseases and have urged action to either close 
            the plants or force them to install anti-pollution equipment. Brian 
            P. Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs for the 
            American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago, said the study 
            "is another nail in the coffin for these old coal-fired power 
            plants." 
            <P>"It makes no sense to weaken the Clean Air Act in light of this 
            important new evidence. It raises urgency to moving forward to 
            reduce fine particles," said A. Blakeman Early, a consultant to the 
            American Lung Assn. 
            <P>"This research dramatically underscores the urgent need for the 
            EPA to limit the emission of these cancer-causing particles," said 
            John Kirkwood, president and chief executive officer of the American 
            Lung Association. "The scientific evidence keeps mounting. In the 
            meantime, we are no closer to protecting people's health because the 
            EPA has not acted." 
            <P>The Bush administration has come under fire from 
            environmentalists and congressional Democrats who contend that the 
            president's energy and environmental policies have been heavily 
            tilted in favor of industry supporters who contributed heavily to 
            the Republicans in the 2000 election. The Senate Governmental 
            Affairs Committee will begin hearings Thursday on the president's 
            environmental policies, including testimony from EPA administrator 
            Christine Todd Whitman and a senior EPA regulatory enforcement 
            officer who resigned last week to protest what he described as

            million tons of toxins into the air every year. Eric V. Schaeffer, 
            director of the EPA's Office of Regulatory Enforcement, said in his 
            scathing resignation letter that he is tired of "fighting a White 
            House that seems determined to weaken the rules that we are trying 
            to enforce" and accused the Bush administration of crippling agency 
            enforcement efforts with budget cuts and undermining legal actions 
            against power companies with "endless delays." 
            <P>Schaeffer said Bush has cut 200 positions from the EPA 
            enforcement staff and is undermining legal efforts to curb air 
            pollution by nine major power companies that are responsible for 
            one-fourth of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions. 
            <P>In his letter, Schaeffer noted that the EPA is already "unable to 
            fill key staff positions, not only in air enforcement, but in other 
            critical programs, and the proposed budget cuts would leave us 
            desperately short of the resources needed to deal with the large, 
            sophisticated corporate defendants we face." 
            <P>Schaeffer said energy-industry lobbyists are helping to write 
            Bush administration proposals to weaken air-pollution regulations 
            for older coal power plants. Enforcing those regulations was 
            Schaeffer's job. He said that Energy Department officials are 
            treating the power industry as their "client" in pursuing drastic 
            changes to enforcement policies aimed at eliminating millions of 
            tons of unlawful air pollution. 
            <P>In an interview after his resignation, Schaeffer said the 
            problems he outlined in his resignation letter "reflect the views of 
            just about all the civil servants working in enforcement" at the 
            EPA. 
            <P>"This is the kind of thing you can't say when you're in 
            government, and it is something I really feel needs to be said," 
            Schaeffer said. 
            <P>"The energy industry is very tight with the Bush administration," 
            Schaeffer said. "In my view they (industry lobbyists) are 
            interfering. I've never seen that kind of political pressure applied 
            to an enforcement issue." 
            <P>"The big problem is the Department of Energy's been put in the 
            front seat on these decisions," Schaeffer said. "Their client is the 
            power industry and our perspective is this is an environmental 
            enforcement matter and I don't think they have a place in those 
            negotiations, but there they are." 
            <P>Schaeffer said energy industry lobbyists are helping to write the 
            administration's reinterpretation of the Clean Air Act. "I've seen 
            lots of memos. We keep getting them from the lobbyists, which is 
            kind of disconcerting," he said. "They're clearly part of the game." 

            <P>Schaeffer said that if some of the proposals he has seen floated, 
            and which have been under discussion at the EPA, are implemented, it 
            would amount to a "rollback of the Clean Air Act." 
            <P>"I decided we had hit a wall and it was going to be really hard 
            to do much more in enforcement without a change in the climate we 
            were working in," Schaeffer said. "I just wanted to bring some 
            public attention to the issue." 
            <P>Schaeffer, 47, began his career as an EPA lawyer in 1990 working 
            in the administrator's office under President George Bush, the 
            current president's father. Before that, he worked for Rep. Claudine 
            Schneider of Rhode Island, a Republican who served from 1975 to 
            1991. 
            <P>In August, Schaeffer received the Justice Department's John 
            Marshall Award for exemplary public service for "interagency 
            cooperation in support of litigation" from Attorney General John 
            Ashcroft for his work in settling oil refinery-pollution cases. 
            <P>The main issue in Schaeffer's resignation is enforcement of a 
            provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act called "new source review." The 
            Clean Air Act exempted certain older stationary sources of pollution 
            - coal-burning power plants, for example - from emissions standards, 
            but one provision in the act mandated that if those sources make 
            significant improvements or expansions that result in additional 
            chemical releases, they would be required to meet the act's 
            standards. This rule went largely unenforced until the latter half 
            of the Clinton administration, when the government sued dozens of 
            power companies. 
            <P>Starting in November 1999, in a program Schaeffer oversaw, the 
            Clinton administration EPA used new source review to force older, 
            more-polluting power companies to cut back emissions if they made 
            large-scale improvements in their plants. Those power companies 
            upgraded or expanded their facilities well beyond routine 
            maintenance without installing new pollution control equipment as 
            required by the Clean Air Act, the EPA and Justice Department say. 
            <P>The Clinton EPA sued nine utilities. One of them - Tampa Electric 
            - settled its suit and installed new pollution controls. Another, 
            PSE&amp;G of New Jersey, yielded last month, even though it was 
            never formally sued. But most of the others have hesitated to settle 
            because the Bush administration is working on changing the rule, 
            Schaeffer said. 
            <P>The energy industry has never liked the new source review 
            requirement and, according to Schaeffer and another source at the 
            EPA, non-compliance is widespread. 
            <P>Schaeffer said signals from the White House that it would relax 
            the rules, which would save industry billions of dollars in costly 
            upgrades, had undermined his ability to file lawsuits and win 
            settlements from polluters. The White House proposals, Schaeffer 
            wrote, "would turn narrow exemptions into larger loopholes." He said 
            the administration was further hurting the agency with its budget 
            proposal to cut 200 staff positions below the level of last year. 
            <P>Vice President Cheney's energy task force, responding to 
            complaints from the energy industry, ordered a 90-day interagency 
            review of the new source review enforcement policy in May 2001 to 
            determine whether the provisions substantially impede power 
            generation. The "90-day" review has now dragged on for nine months 
            and produced sharp divisions. On one side are EPA officials who 
            believe coal-fired plants that are more than 25 years old must 
            install modern anti-pollution equipment to keep operating. On the 
            other side are energy industry lobbyists and Energy Department and 
            White House officials who believe utilities should be free to 
            "update" their plants without installing modern pollution-control 
            equipment. 
            <P>The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a coalition of 
            utility companies formed last year to lobby against the lawsuits, 
            has met several times with Bush administration officials to press 
            for weaker guidelines. On July 23, 2001, for example, a 15-person 
            delegation - including former Republican National Committee chairman 
            Haley Barbour and representatives of Southern Co. and Duke Power Co. 
            - met with Deputy Energy Secretary Francis S. Blake to discuss the 
            issue, according to an Energy Department document. 
            <P>A recently disclosed EPA document sharply criticized the Energy 
            Department for recommending changes in how regulators decide what 
            level of factory emissions would trigger controls and for allowing 
            plants to avoid stricter controls for 15 years under some 
            circumstances. 
            <P>Schaeffer said the companies are responsible for pumping 5 
            million tons of sulfur dioxide - known to cause haze, acid rain and 
            lung ailments - and 2 million tons of nitrogen oxide pollution into 
            the atmosphere every year. He cited an EPA report to the Senate 
            Environment Committee that estimated the health cost from these 
            emissions at 10,800 premature deaths, about 5,400 incidents of 
            chronic bronchitis, more than 5,100 hospital emergency cases 
            involving respiratory problems and some 1.5 million lost workdays. 
            "As the scale of pollution from these coal-fired smokestacks is 
            immense, so is the damage to public health," Schaeffer wrote EPA 
            Administrator Christie Whitman in his resignation letter. "Add to 
            that severe damage to our natural resources, as acid rain attacks 
            soils and plants and deposits nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay and 
            other critical bodies of water." 
            <P>"Fifteen months ago, it looked as though our lawsuits were going 
            to shrink these dismal statistics. ... Yet today we seem about to 
            snatch defeat from the jaws of victory," wrote Schaeffer. 
            <P>Industry insiders said it is rare for an official of Schaeffer's 
            stature to resign with such a candid critique. Schaeffer will go to 
            work as a consultant for the Rockefeller Family Fund, which gives 
            money to environmental and women's rights groups. 
            <P>Schaeffer's is the most recent voice in a chorus of people 
            worried that the Bush administration is on the verge of gutting the 
            Clean Air Act. They include Gov. George E. Pataki, Republican of New 
            York, who recently wrote to Vice President Dick Cheney warning that 
            the administration's changes in the new source review program "must 
            not have the practical effect of weakening the air quality 
            protections provided by the existing N.S.R. provisions." 
            <P>Environmentalists said Schaeffer is only bringing to the open 
            what they had suspected all along. Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air 
            Trust and John Coequyt of Environmental Working Group said 
            Schaeffer's letter is proof the administration had tilted its 
            enforcement policies in favor of industry. 
            <P>"What's it going to take for this administration to crack down on 
            polluters? If this doesn't shake them up, what will?" asked John 
            Coequyt, a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group. "Eric 
            Schaeffer is as dedicated a public servant as you can find. If 
            there's no home for him at E.P.A. any more, it's a sure sign that 
            this president is in full retreat from serious environmental 
            protection. The health of millions of Americans will suffer for the 
            man's departure." 
            <P>"Anyone who has seen the pollution at Shenandoah National Park, 
            the Smokies, Big Bend or Acadia knows we need to do more, not less, 
            to clean up the air," said Joy Oakes, coordinator of the National 
            Parks Conservation Association's Clean Air Campaign. 
            <P>Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said his group was 
            distressed by the resignation. "All Americans should be alarmed by 
            Mr. Schaeffer's letter of resignation," Pope said. "[It] confirms 
            our fears that the Bush administration is preventing the nation's 
            environmental cop from policing his beat. 
            <P>"Among Mr. Schaeffer's chief concerns in his resignation letter 
            was the Bush administration's pressure to weaken enforcement of New 
            Source Review, an important Clean Air Act program that requires 
            antiquated power plants and factories to install pollution control 
            equipment when they expand," Pope continued. 
            <P>"This Clean Air Act provision has been instrumental in regulating 
            refineries and power plants," he said, noting that plants built 
            between 1940 and 1970 emit more pollutants than modern facilities. 
            <P>"The resignation of someone at Mr. Schaeffer's level underscores 
            the fact that environmental enforcement is a very weak spot in the 
            administration's approach to environmental policy," said Joan 
            Mulhern of Earthjustice, a Washington environmental law firm. 
            <P>The following is the full text of Schaeffer's resignation letter: 

            <P>Christine Whitman<BR>Administrator<BR>U.S. Environmental 
            Protection Agency<BR>1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.<BR>Washington, 
            D.C. 20004 
            <P>Dear Ms. Whitman: 
            <P>I resign today from the Environmental Protection Agency after 12 
            years of service, the last five as Director of the Office of 
            Regulatory Enforcement. I am grateful for the opportunities I have 
            been given, and leave with a deep admiration for the men and women 
            of EPA who dedicate their lives to protecting the environment and 
            the public health. Their faith in the Agency's mission is an 
            inspiring example to those who still believe that government should 
            stand for the public interest. 
            <P>But I cannot leave without sharing my frustration about the fate 
            of our enforcement actions against power companies that have 
            violated the Clean Air Act. Between November of 1999 and December of 
            2000, EPA filed lawsuits against nine power companies for expanding 
            their plants without obtaining New Source Review permits and the 
            up-to-date pollution controls required by law. The companies named 
            in our lawsuits emit an incredible 5 million tons of sulfur dioxide 
            every year (a quarter of the emissions in the entire country) as 
            well as 2 million tons of nitrogen oxide. 
            <P>As the scale of pollution from these coal-fired smokestacks is 
            immense, so is the damage to public health. Data supplied to the 
            Senate Environment Committee by EPA last year estimate the annual 
            health bill from 7 million tons of SO2 and NO2: more than 10,800 
            premature deaths; at least 5,400 incidents of chronic bronchitis; 
            more than 5,100 hospital emergency visits; and over 1.5 million lost 
            work days. Add to that severe damage to our natural resources, as 
            acid rain attacks soils and plants and deposits nitrogen in the 
            Chesapeake Bay and other critical bodies of water. 
            <P>Fifteen months ago, it looked as though our lawsuits were going 
            to shrink these dismal statistics, when EPA publicly announced 
            agreements with Cinergy and Vepco to reduce Sox and Nox emissions by 
            a combined 750,000 tons per year. Settlements already lodged with 
            two other companies - TECO and PSE&amp;G - will eventually take 
            another quarter million tons of Nox and Sox out of the air annually. 
            If we get similar results from the nine companies with filed 
            complaints, we are on track to reduce both pollutants by a combined 
            4.8 million tons per year. And that does not count the hundreds of 
            thousands of additional tons that can be obtained from other 
            companies with whom we have been negotiating. 
            <P>Yet today, we seem about to snatch defeat from the jaws of 
            victory. We are in the ninth month of a "90 day review" to reexamine 
            the law, and fighting a White House that seems determined to weaken 
            the rules we are trying to enforce. It is hard to know which is 
            worse, the endless delay or the repeated leaks by energy industry 
            lobbyists of draft rule changes that would undermine lawsuits 
            already filed. At their heart, these proposals would turn narrow 
            exemptions into larger loopholes that would allow old 
            "grandfathered" plants to be continually rebuilt (and emissions to 
            increase) without modern pollution controls. 
            <P>Our negotiating position is weakened further by the 
            Administration's budget proposal to cut the civil enforcement 
            program by more than 200 staff positions below the 2001 level. 
            Already, we are unable to fill key staff positions, not only in air 
            enforcement, but in other critical programs, and the proposed budget 
            cuts would leave us desperately short of the resources needed to 
            deal with the large, sophisticated corporate defendants we face. And 
            it is completely unrealistic to expect underfunded state 
            environmental programs, facing their own budget cuts, to take up the 
            slack. 
            <P>It is no longer possible to pretend that the ongoing debate with 
            the White House and Department of Energy is not effecting our 
            ability to negotiate settlements. Cinergy and Vepco have refused to 
            sign the consent decrees they agreed to 15 months ago, hedging their 
            bets while waiting for the Administration's Clean Air Act reform 
            proposals. Other companies with whom we were close to settlement 
            have walked away from the table. The momentum we obtained with 
            agreements announced earlier has stopped, and we have filed no new 
            lawsuits against utility companies since this Administration took 
            office. We obviously cannot settle cases with defendants who think 
            we are still rewriting the law. 
            <P>The arguments against sustaining our enforcement actions don't 
            hold up to scrutiny. 
            <P>Were the complaints filed by the U.S. government based on 
            conflicting or changing interpretations? The Justice Department 
            doesn't think so. Its review of our enforcement actions found EPA's 
            interpretation of the law to be reasonable and consistent. While the 
            Justice Department has gamely insisted it will continue to prosecute 
            existing cases, the confusion over where EPA is going with New 
            Source Review has made settlement almost impossible, and protracted 
            litigation inevitable. 
            <P>What about the energy crisis? It stubbornly refuses to 
            materialize, as experts predict a glut of power plants in some areas 
            of the U.S. In any case, our settlements are flexible enough to 
            provide for cleaner air while protecting consumers from rate shock. 
            <P>The relative costs and benefits? EPA's regulatory impact 
            analyses, reviewed by OMB, quantify health and environmental 
            benefits of $7,300 per ton of SO2 reduced at a cost of less than 
            $1,000 per ton. These cases should be supported by anyone who thinks 
            cost-benefit analysis is a serious tool for decision-making, not a 
            political game. 
            <P>Is the law too complicated to understand? Most of the projects 
            our cases targeted involved big expansion projects that pushed 
            emission increases many times over the limits allowed by law. 
            <P>Should we try to fix the problem by passing a new law? Assuming 
            the Administration's bill survives a legislative odyssey in today's 
            evenly divided Congress, it will send us right back where we started 
            with new rules to write, which will then be delayed by industry 
            challenges, and with fewer emissions reductions than we can get by 
            enforcing today's law. 
            <P>I believe you share the concerns I have expressed, and wish you 
            well in your efforts to persuade the Administration to put our 
            enforcement actions back on course. Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican 
            and our greatest environmental President, said, "Compliance with the 
            law is demanded as a right, not asked as a favor." By showing that 
            powerful utility interests are not exempt from that principle, you 
            will prove to EPA's staff that their faith in the Agency's mission 
            is not in vain. And you will leave the American public with an 
            environmental victory that will be felt for generations to come. 
            <P>Sincerely,<BR>Eric V. Schaeffer, Director<BR>Office of Regulatory 
            Enforcement

            believed to be contributing to milder winters in parts of the 
            northern hemisphere," said Steven Sherwood, assistant professor of 
            geology and geophysics. "The cooling is caused as much by the 
            increased humidity as by carbon dioxide." 
            <P>"Higher humidity also helps catalyze the destruction of the ozone 
            layer," added Sherwood, whose article appears in the journal 
            Science. 
            <P>Cooling in the stratosphere causes changes to the jet stream, 
            which in turn produce milder winters in North America and Europe. By 
            contrast, harsher winters result in the Arctic due to the changes in 
            the jet stream. 
            <P>Sherwood said that about half of the increased humidity in the 
            stratosphere has been attributed to methane oxidation. It is not yet 
            known what caused the remaining added moisture. 
            <P>In a study funded by the National Aeronautics and Space 
            Administration (NASA), Sherwood examined a combination of data from 
            a NASA satellite launched in the 1990s and operational weather 
            satellite data archived at the Goddard Institute for Space Science 
            in New York. In particular, he studied monthly and yearly 
            fluctuations of humidity in the stratosphere, relative humidity near 
            the tropical tropopause (the place where air enters the 
            stratosphere), ice crystal size in cumulus clouds, and aerosols 
            associated with tropical biomass burning. 
            <P>Tropical biomass burning is any burning of plant material. In the 
            tropics, the burning is often associated with the clearing of forest 
            or grassland for agricultural purposes. 
            <P>"More aerosols lead to smaller ice crystals and more water vapor 
            entering the stratosphere," Sherwood explained. "Aerosols are smoke 
            from burning. They fluctuate seasonally and geographically. Over 
            decades there have been increases linked to population growth." (<A

            <P><B>(02/18/2002) Contrary to expectations, researchers find tiny 
            air pollution particles can pass through the human lung-blood 
            barrier and enter the bloodstream, carrying toxic and carcinogenic 
            substances throughout the body.</B> With the aid of an imaging 
            technique that uses a radioactive isotope, researchers in Belgium 
            have shown that small particles, similar in size to those found in 
            air pollution, can enter a person's bloodstream from the lungs. 
            According to the investigators, the findings could help explain the 
            "poorly understood" relationship between air pollution and 
            cardiovascular disease - such as the recent evidence tying air 
            pollution exposure to significant increases in the risk of heart 
            attack and birth defects. 
            <P>The new findings "came somewhat as a surprise because it is 
            generally believed that the lung-blood barrier is very impermeable 
            for particles and only allows the passage of gases or vapors," said 
            Dr. Ben Nemery, of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. "So, what we 
            showed is that this barrier may be more leaky than we thought, at 
            least for the smallest particles." 
            <P>Small particles are abundant in urban air since they are produced 
            by diesel-powered engines - and are possibly the ones that are the 
            most harmful to health, Nemery noted. "The fact that they can 
            penetrate into the blood circulation could explain why people may 
            die from cardiovascular causes - like heart attacks - as a result of 
            increased urban air pollution," he said. 
            <P>In their investigation, the researchers tracked the movement of 
            radioactive particles after five nonsmoking men between the ages of 
            24 and 47 inhaled them. Immediately after inhalation, the men 
            underwent body scans that monitored the particles as they traveled 
            from the lungs, into the bloodstream and to different organs 
            including the liver and bladder. The men also had several blood 
            samples drawn throughout the scanning procedure, which lasted about 
            60 minutes. 
            <P>"The radioactivity was detected in blood already after 1 minute, 
            reached a maximum between 10 and 20 minutes, and remained at this 
            level up to 60 minutes," the authors report in Circulation: Journal 
            of the American Heart Association. They note that the radioactive 
            ultra-fine particles used in the study, and considered to be "very 
            similar to the ultra-fine fraction of actual pollutant particles," 
            traveled rapidly into the bloodstream. 
            <P>The finding "should be considered relevant for the cardiovascular 
            (illness and death) related to ambient particle pollution," the 
            investigators conclude. 
            <P>"Small particles stay airborne for a long time," Nemery said. 
            "These particles may be harmful by themselves or because they carry 
            toxic - or carcinogenic - substances on their surface." (<A

            <P><B>(02/18/2002) Scientists warn half of Amazon rainforest is 
            being profoundly damaged by toxic gases and particulates released by 
            forest fires started by farmers to clear land for planting.</B> Half 
            of the Amazon rain forest is being damaged by the pollution caused 
            by forest burning, according to new research presented at the 
            American Association for the Advancement of Science's 2002 annual 
            meeting. Previous concerns about the world's largest rainforest have 
            focused on the burning itself, which has now destroyed 14 percent of 
            the forest's five million square kilometres. But the new research 
            shows that half of the remaining pristine forest is being degraded 
            by the gases and particulates released by the burning, much of which 
            is caused by farmers starting fires to clear land for planting. 
            <P>Paulo Artaxo, who conducted the work with colleagues at the 
            Universidade de So Paulo in Brazil, said: "This is causing a 
            profound effect on the health of the ecosystem - there is no doubt 
            about it. " 
            <P>The pollution caused by burning will also impact on the Amazon 
            forest's critical role in the global climate, affecting the 
            production of water vapour in the tropics. [ECES note: see next 
            article for more on this topic.] 
            <P>Daniel Rosenfeld, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, points 
            out that particulate pollution has an immediate impact and is also a 
            concern across the world: "Greenhouse gases will dominate climate 
            change in the long term but we should give similar priority to what 
            happens to climate in this generation as a result of particulate 
            pollution. We have a very different climate to what we would have if 
            we had kept our atmosphere clean." 
            <P>Artaxo's work calculates for the first time the amount of the 
            sunlight absorbed by the pollution caused by forest burning. The 
            cooling is produced by tiny aerosol particles in the air which have 
            a very significant effect on photosynthesis. In some places there is 
            40 percent reduction in the total radiation that would have reached 
            the surface, says Artaxo. 
            <P>A second effect is the poisoning of vegetation by ozone, a 
            phytotoxic gas produced by burning. Natural levels of ozone are no 
            higher than 15 ppm, says Artaxo, but in affected areas in Amazonia 
            levels are nearly seven times higher. The ozone can travel up to 
            1,500 kilometres from the site of the burning, meaning vast tracts 
            of untainted forest are affected. "Other studies in China show that 
            ozone pollution has reduced the production of crops by 20 to 25 
            percent," he adds. 
            <P>Amazonia has suffered tremendous land use changes in last 20 
            years, says Artaxo, but one programme Brazil is currently promoting 
            to tackle the problem is to persuade farmers to cut down forest, not 
            burn it. An additional agricultural benefit of this is that, if the 
            felled vegetation is left on the ground for 12 to 18 months, its 
            nutrients leach into the soil rather than being lost to the air. (<A

            <P><B>(02/17/2002) Scientists say air pollution is dramatically 
            disrupting and changing rainfall patterns around the world.</B> New 
            satellite data shows tiny airborne particles are changing rainfall 
            patterns around the world, researchers say. The human-made 
            particles, mostly from burning fossil fuels, make it more difficult 
            for clouds to form and less likely to rain if they do form, 
            according to researchers at the annual meeting of the American 
            Association for the Advancement of Science. 
            <P>Because they block sunlight, these tiny particles slow down 
            evaporation from lakes and oceans, said conference participant 
            Daniel Rosenfeld of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "So they 
            suppress clouds in the first place," he said. 
            <P>What's more, he said, the particles are too small to form the 
            seeds of raindrops, "so the clouds that do form ... have a hard time 
            to rain." 
            <P>The analysis, he said, is based on new data from a joint 
            American-Japanese satellite that uses radar to examine particles in 
            both shallow clouds, near the Earth's surface, and the large, high 
            clouds that contribute most of the rainfall. 
            <P>Rainfall from even the biggest thunderclouds can be cut in half 
            by such pollution, Rosenfeld said, and it can completely stop rain 
            from shallow clouds. 
            <P>Sooner or later, he said, the evaporated water does come down as 
            rain, but not where it used to. For instance, he said, the satellite 
            data show rain that used to fall in the tropics is being transported 
            to higher latitudes. He added the areas most affected are those with 
            the worst air pollution - and those tend to be the most populated 
            areas, where water is an essential resource. 
            <P>Human-made pollution also is affecting the monsoons of Asia, 
            according to Veerabhadran Ramanathan, of the Scripps Institution of 
            Oceanography. He said a low-level haze over most of the Indian Ocean 
            is blocking sunlight and changing the pattern of evaporation. As a 
            result, he said, the monsoons of southeast Asia have more rain, 
            while the rest of the region gets less precipitation. 
            <P>Brazilian researcher Paulo Artaxo, of the University of Sao 
            Paulo, reported a similar discovery in the forests of Amazonia. 
            Between the months of August and October, when farmers burn off 
            woodland, the haze of particles has a dramatic cooling effect on the 
            ground below. The cooling effect may be as much as 47 degrees 
            Fahrenheit, he said, enough to interfere with evaporation and cloud 
            formation. "To have a cloud form," Artaxo said, "you have to have 
            water vapor from evaporation." [ECES note: See article above this 
            one for a more indepth report on Artaxo's research.] 
            <P>While the environmental emphasis has been on global warming 
            caused by greenhouse gases, these tiny particles - known as 
            "aerosols" in scientific jargon - may cause local cooling effects, 
            said Yoram Kaufman of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. But 
            overall, he said, greenhouse gases remain the greatest concern, 
            because human-made aerosols remain in the air for only a few weeks, 
            while gases such as methane can last decades. 
            <P>"If we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow," he said, "the 
            aerosols would be gone in a week, but the gases would be there for 
            years." (<A

            <P><B>(02/11/2002) Scientists say destruction of World Trade Center 
            resulted in the most hazardous plumes of air pollution ever seen as 
            crushed concrete, glass, computers, electrical wiring, carpeting, 
            furniture, steel, and other materials continued to burn for months 
            afterwards.</B> The attack that destroyed the World Trade Center 
            last September exposed New Yorkers downwind to the most hazardous 
            plumes of extremely fine chemical and metal particles that experts 
            have ever seen, University of California scientists have reported. 
            After the twin towers collapsed into flaming rubble after they were 
            hit by two hijacked airliners, wind gusts continued sending up thick 
            clouds containing billions of the particles for weeks afterward. 
            <P>The unprecedented pollution was far worse than even that from the 
            Kuwait oil field fires set by Iraq during the Gulf War or the 
            soot-filled air from Beijing's wintertime coal-burning furnaces, and 
            about 500 times more than what's in the air on the smoggiest days in 
            California's Sacramento Valley, said UC Davis researcher Thomas 
            Cahill, an international authority on air pollution who led the 
            study investigating the catastrophe's consequences for the 
            Department of Energy. 
            <P>"What we found was startling," Cahill said. "A large mass of very 
            fine particles results in an extraordinary number of particles that 
            penetrate deep in the lungs." 
            <P>"Those particles downwind over New York were like nothing we've 
            ever seen anywhere," Cahill said. Cahill heads the UC Davis DELTA 
            Group - the term stands for Detection and Evaluation of Long-Range 
            Transport of Aerosols - that has analyzed particulate hazards all 
            over the world. Cahill, 65, is a professor emeritus of physics and 
            atmospheric sciences. He has used his background in nuclear physics 
            to pioneer methods and tools for analyzing aerosols - tiny particles 
            suspended in the air - and has led more than 40 studies on pollution 
            around the world, including several in national parks and in the 
            basins of Lake Tahoe and Mono Lake. 
            <P>The Sept. 11 collapse of the 110-story skyscrapers crushed 
            concrete, glass, computers, electrical wiring, carpeting, furniture 
            and everything else in the building, then burned and broiled the 
            compressed, pulverized mass for weeks. In the super-heated rubble 
            the material disintegrated into extremely small particles, which 
            were released into the air for weeks. "It's like having a large 
            power plant at ground level with no stack," Cahill said. 
            <P>The particles "were really weird: They came in great big spikes 
            when the wind blew, then they'd die down, then spike up again. And 
            the particles that aren't soluble - like silicon from burning glass 
            - are the ones that can lodge in your lungs and irritate them badly 
            - and stay there," Cahill said. 
            <P>Emphysema, asthma, other lung diseases and even heart disease are 
            among the health problems that can be aggravated or caused by 
            pollutant particles that lodge in the lungs. "There are a lot of 
            reasons to believe that people who inhale very fine particles have a 
            higher risk of lung cancer," said Robert Nolan, a specialist on 
            particulate pollution at the City University of New York in 
            Brooklyn. 
            <P>The high Ground Zero readings surprised Nolan. "These numbers of 
            fine particles are higher than I ever expected - they're off the 
            chart," Nolan said. 
            <P>Nolan lives within four miles of Ground Zero. "I have been 
            coughing for four months," he said. Workers at the WTC site have 
            complained of a variety of maladies. 
            <P>To pin down the nature of the particles from the burning twin 
            towers rubble, Cahill recruited researchers from UC's $100-million 
            Advanced Light Source facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National 
            Laboratory for precise X-ray images of the tiny particles, and UC's 
            Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for that facility's ion 
            microscopy and proton scattering devices. Last Oct. 2, the team 
            mounted a particle-collecting air monitor on a rooftop at 201 Varick 
            St. in Manhattan, a mile north-northeast of the trade center 
            complex, and samples were shipped back regularly to UC Davis through 
            the end of December. 
            <P>The scientists' report covers the period through the end of 
            October. The UC Davis analysis is continuing, but Cahill said he 
            felt obligated to share results quickly to help New Yorkers take 
            precautions to protect their health. 
            <P>Although standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency for 
            analyzing particle size, their density, their composition and their 
            hazards differ somewhat from the DELTA Group's, the differences are 
            largely technical. Cahill's team collected particle samples ranging 
            in size from "coarse," or 12 microns - about the diameter of the 
            period at the end of this sentence - to "ultra-fine" - so small that 
            it would take 1 billion to fill the period at the end of this 
            sentence. Their weight was measured in "nanograms," or billionths of 
            a gram. 
            <P>Fine particles almost always are byproducts of human activities, 
            produced through combustion, typically power plants, or gasoline and 
            diesel engines. The smaller the speck, the harder it is for the body 
            to flush out. Further, a mass of very small particles poses a 
            greater risk than an equal mass of larger particles because each 
            particle surface potentially can react with body chemistry to damage 
            cells. 
            <P>"The ruins of the twin towers became a screamingly hot chemical 
            reactor," Cahill said, "and for weeks, even as the flames eased and 
            the core of the towers cooled below 1,200 degrees, the steel was 
            still glowing red at 800 degrees by November, and clouds of 
            particles were still rising. 
            <P>"Those particles simply shouldn't have been there, because it 
            rained heavily for six days in September after the attack, and the 
            coarse particles should have settled down. But they were probably 
            still being generated from the heat in the pile of debris." 
            <P>Among the fine and very fine metal particles rising from the 
            rubble, for which the EPA has set no health guidelines, are iron 
            from the girders, titanium from the concrete, vanadium and nickel - 
            possibly associated with burning fuel oil - as well as copper and 
            zinc. Lead particles, most likely from the thousands of computers in 
            the towers, and mercury from the building's electrical circuits were 
            detected in lower concentrations, Cahill reported. 
            <P>The analysts found relatively few pulverized asbestos fibers from 
            the debris, he said - probably because the twin towers contractors 
            stopped using asbestos half-way through construction of the 
            110-story buildings, which were completed in 1972 and 1973. 
            <P>By now, Cahill said, the evidence indicates that the air over New 
            York City is no longer affected by the World Trade Center disaster 
            because the fires are out and the debris pile has cooled. The Ground 
            Zero monitoring showed the fallout had subsided by late December, 
            when Cahill's team stopped sampling. He said rain probably has 
            cleared the air outside, but he is concerned about New Yorkers 
            returning to contaminated buildings. 
            <P>"These-size particles ... travel like a gas. They penetrate 
            windows, doors, everywhere," Cahill said. "You don't feel it, and 
            you can't see it." 
            <P>Cahill recommended throwing away carpeting and fabrics that 
            cannot be thoroughly washed, and cleaning everything else with water 
            - not by vacuuming, which blows particles around. He suggested that 
            people handling the cleanup wear soaking wet masks in lieu of 
            respirators. 
            <P>UC Davis released its findings amid mounting questions of why 
            firefighters, cleanup workers and some residents are plagued by 
            chronic coughing and other respiratory problems if the air truly has 
            been safe. Me workers and New Yorkers have complained of what's 
            being called "World Trade Center Cough" as well as asthma and 
            diminished lung capacity. 
            <P>In New York, at least 2,500 of the 10,000 members of the Fire 
            Department have respiratory problems, said Tom Manley, health and 
            safety officer for the Uniformed Firefighters Association, their 
            labor union. He said about 700 are out on medical leave. And 
            California state and local officials are surveying members of the 
            state's Urban Search and Rescue Teams after receiving reports of 
            health problems among some of those members after they returned from 
            New York. 
            <P>According to Menlo Park Fire Protection District Capt. Harold 
            Schapelhouman, of the 67 team members who went to New York, 70 
            percent had reported being sick upon their return. Of those, 42 
            percent reported a chronic cough, and 3 percent reported pneumonia. 
            The team is now conducting more in-depth surveys, and Schapelhouman 
            says he is working with FEMA to coordinate a nationwide health 
            survey of rescue team members. 
            <P>Schapelhouman says he plans to send information about the UC 
            Davis study to his own affected team members as well as to other 
            teams across the country. "All these guys want is to be kept in the 
            loop. ... They want to know what it is," he said. "They would all do 
            it again, but ... they took the chances, and they deserve to know 
            the truth." 
            <P>The ominous findings by Cahill's team contradict repeated 
            assurances by EPA Administrator Christie Whitman that the air around 
            the wreckage largely was safe to breathe. "They had an unprecedented 
            situation, and they applied the usual approaches," said Cahill. 
            <P>The conventional analysis used by the EPA captured the same range 
            of particle sizes but averaged them in a way that smooths out the 
            extraordinary peaks of the smallest particles. EPA spokeswoman Nina 
            Habib Spencer said the agency was obligated to follow its 
            established monitoring methods. "We are an agency of numbers and an 
            agency of standards, and we adhere to those standards," Spencer 
            said. 
            <P>But Cahill said the EPA standard is inadequate under the 
            circumstances. "The aerosols from the World Trade Center are so 
            anomalous that the criteria are irrelevant," he said. 
            <P>Bruce Case, former director of the EPA's Center for Environmental 
            Epidemiology, agreed. "This was a unique event in many ways, and one 
            of those ways was the types of human exposures produced," said Case, 
            an asbestos disease specialist now at McGill University in Montreal. 
            "We don't yet know what those were, and I think it is possible that 
            the data that has so far been reported, since it used traditional 
            methods, was not necessarily the most relevant data." 
            <P>Case predicted that the health fallout from the World Trade 
            Center attack will continue indefinitely. "Regrettably," he said, 
            "what we have here is a human experiment on a grand scale." 
            <P>In a Senate hearing on air quality in Lower Manhattan, Sen. Joe 
            Lieberman, D-Conn., said the clean-air subcommittee of the Senate's 
            environment panel will ask EPA head Christie Whitman why the agency 
            didn't report findings by the U.S. Geological Survey that showed 
            some of the World Trade Center dust was as caustic as drain cleaner. 

            <P>The test results were brought to the committee's attention by 
            Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who has criticized the EPA for failing 
            to share critical findings. "It took less than two weeks in 
            September" to test the alkalinity of the dust, Nadler said. "We must 
            determine why the EPA hid this information from the public." 
            <P>In the days after the World Trade Center collapsed, a team of top 
            government scientists confirmed that the smoky, gray dust in the air 
            was highly corrosive and a potentially serious health threat. 
            Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey collected dust samples 
            from 35 locations including window ledges and car windshields from 
            Sept 16. through Sept. 23. Most of the samples had a pH of 9.5 to 
            10.5, about the same alkalinity as ammonia. Two samples had a pH of 
            11.8 to 12.1, the equivalent to what is found in liquid drain 
            cleaner. On Sept. 27, the information was e-mailed to government 
            agencies responding to the disaster. But, to this date, the EPA has 
            released no information on pH levels. 
            <P>Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for 
            Occupational Safety and Health, said the decision not to publicize 
            the findings prevented people from making appropriate decisions on 
            when to return to their offices and homes. "It is distressing that 
            these findings were found early and never made public," Shufro said. 
            "For an agency that is charged with protecting the public, it뭩 a 
            glaring oversight. It뭩 an oversight which has had unfortunate 
            consequences for people뭩 health." 
            <P>The Natural Resources Defense Council is also planning to release 
            a report exposing the failures of city agencies in responding to the 
            attacks. Eric Goldstein, senior attorney of the group, said the 
            study concludes that the city Department of Environmental Protection 
            failed to respond to residents concerns on safety and cleanup 
            standards. 
            <P>"This was a manageable and solvable set of issues of a small 
            group in a compact area," Goldstein said. "Yet, the [former Mayor 
            Rudolph] Giuliani administration placed health concerns on lower 
            priority than other issues like economic recovery." 
            <P>Some residents of the area have complained that five months after 
            the attacks they are still not sure their apartments were adequately 
            cleaned, or if they remain in danger from substances such as 
            asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, or lead, which can cause cancer 
            or neurological damage after long-term exposure. 
            <P>"No one tells you what to keep and what to toss," said Elizabeth 
            Berger, who lives just 150 yards from Ground Zero with her husband 
            and two children. "Let me tell you, everyone downtown knows that we 
            are the baseline of the 30-year study on what happens when worlds 
            collide." 
            <P>In a way, the UC Davis findings are just scientific confirmation 
            of what New Yorkers believe through common sense, said Michael 
            Barasch, a New York lawyer who has filed health claims against the 
            city on behalf of nearly 1,000 firefighters, plus some police and 
            sanitation workers. For months, he detected the scent of danger in 
            the air. "It was that acrid smell. It was clearly electrical things 
            burning," said Barasch, whose office is two blocks from Ground Zero. 
            "Every single person you would speak to knew it was not safe." (<A

            <P><B>(12/18/2001) New study underscores previous findings that air 
            pollution can dramatically impair normal development of children's 
            lungs.</B> A new study underscores earlier findings that air 
            pollution can dramatically slow the healthy growth and development 
            of children's lungs. Preventive medicine researchers led by Edward 
            Avol, associate professor of research in preventive medicine at USC 
            and the study's lead author, followed 110 children through their 
            teen years and compared those who stayed in the Los Angeles area to 
            those who moved away to other communities in the West. The 
            researchers found that changes in air pollution exposure affected 
            the children's annual rates of lung function growth, the team 
            reported in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care 
            Medicine. 
            <P>"This study confirms our earlier work showing that air pollution 
            can have long term effects on lung health in children. It also shows 
            that cleaning up the air actually has a measurable effect on 
            children's health," said Avol. "On average, children who moved away 
            to areas with lower levels of pollution had increased rates of lung 
            function growth, while children who moved to areas with higher 
            pollution had decreased rates." 
            <P>The research is part of the USC-led Children's Health Study, an 
            extensive, long-term investigation into pollution and kids' health. 
            Researchers have tracked levels of major pollutants in 12 Southern 
            California communities since 1993 while monitoring the pulmonary 
            health of more than 6,000 students in the area. 
            <P>The team studied 110 children who had lived in Southern 
            California in the 1990s but later moved away. Children were first 
            tested at about age 10 in Southern California, then followed up at 
            age 15 - after they had relocated to other communities in 
            California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Arizona or Utah. 
            <P>Researchers tested lung function by having each child take a deep 
            breath, then measured how much and how fast the kids could blow out 
            the air. The more they could blow, the higher the level of lung 
            function. They found that as a group, students who had moved to 
            areas with fewer microscopic particles in the air showed increased 
            growth in lung function. Those who moved to areas with more 
            particulate matter showed a slowdown in lung function growth. The 
            trend was strongest for those who had moved away three years or more 
            before they were tested. 
            <P>Avol and his colleagues hope to follow the children as they 
            progress into adulthood, to better understand the persistent and 
            long term effects of air pollution. The researchers are particularly 
            interested in lung function during adolescence. "When kids hit 
            puberty, their lungs start to grow quite quickly," Avol said. 
            "Girls' lungs grow until their late teens, and boys' lungs until 
            their early 20s. Lung function typically peaks in your 20s and then 
            slowly declines with age. So what happens during that big growth 
            spurt during the teen years may be especially important later in 
            life." 
            <P>The American Lung Association of Los Angeles County notes the 
            county consistently has some of the worst air in the nation and the 
            highest number of emergency room visits caused by smog and air 
            pollution. Millions of Southern Californians breathe polluted air 
            every day, and pollution levels exceed federal and state standards 
            for air quality in several areas of Los Angeles. Although polluted 
            air is known to cause immediate problems such as eye irritation, 
            coughing and chest tightness, its long term effects have been less 
            studied. 
            <P>Particulate matter is one ingredient of the cocktail of airborne 
            pollutants that come from the burning of fossil fuels, including the 
            exhaust from motor vehicles as well as from emissions from factories 
            and power plants. The lungs can protect humans from breathing dust, 
            pollen and germs, but air pollution puts an additional stress on the 
            body's defenses. In fact, says the Lung Association, some 
            particulate matter is so small that it bypasses the lung's defenses 
            all together. 
            <P>Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Air 
            Trust, said the findings "underscore concerns about a 
            polluter-inspired plan to weaken enforcement and pollution control 
            requirements for refineries, factories and electric power plants." 
            <P>O'Donnell noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 
            preparing to allow industry to increase pollution emissions when 
            expanding or making "major modifications" to industrial plants. 
            "Under pressure from industry, the Department of Energy and Vice 
            President [Richard] Cheney, EPA is reportedly preparing to announce 
            gaping new loopholes - loopholes that will allow industry to 
            increase pollution and cause more health damage to children and 
            others. These new lethal loopholes are being prepared while the 
            public and media are distracted by the war on terrorism." (<A

            <P><B>(12/18/2001) CSIRO Scientists warn "new car smell" is actually 
            a poisonous soup of carcinogens and other toxins that can damage 
            fetuses and make people fatigued and confused.</B> Australian 
            scientists are warning that the desirable smell of a new car 
            actually contains high levels of toxic air emissions which can make 
            drivers ill. A study by Australia's highly respected scientific 
            body, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
            Organization (CSIRO), found high levels of toxic emissions in cars 
            for up to six months and longer after they leave the showroom. The 
            toxic emissions include benzene, a cancer-causing toxin; acetone, a 
            mucosal irritant; ethylbenzene, a systemic toxic agent; and xylene 
            isomers, a foetal development toxic agent. 
            <P>The study found two new Australian-made cars had very high levels 
            of volatile organic compounds, up to 64,000 micrograms per cubic 
            meter, three to 10 weeks after manufacture. A control group of 
            people exposed to half that amount reported within minutes feeling 
            discomfort, drowsiness, fatigue and confusion, eye and ear and nose 
            irritation and headaches. The toxic air emission levels decrease 60 
            percent in the first month but were still well above the Australian 
            recommended health level of 500 micrograms per cubic meter, said 
            CSIRO. 
            <P>A third car in the study was imported to Australia, but four 
            months after manufacture it contained high levels of toxic air 
            emissions, recording 2,000 micrograms per cubic meter. "This is 
            still four times more than the recommended goal and remains a 
            concern," said Steve Brown, head of the CSIRO's air quality control 
            research unit. 
            <P>"Just as air inside our homes and workplaces is often much more 
            polluted than the air outside, so sitting in a new car can expose 
            you to levels of toxic emissions many times beyond (health 
            guideline) goals," said Brown. "To avoid some exposure to this toxic 
            cocktail people who buy new cars should make sure there is plenty of 
            outside air entering the vehicle while they drive for at least six 
            months." 
            <P>The two-year study of three new cars also found anecdotal 
            evidence that drivers were becoming ill when they drove their new 
            cars. A lawyer reported being ill with headaches, lung irritation 
            and swellings for several days after collecting a new car and 
            driving it for only 10 minutes. When he swapped his new car for an 
            18-month-old car he no longer felt ill. 
            <P>A public servant felt ill when driving a new government car for 
            the first six months, a chemically sensitized person felt "spaced 
            out" when driving any new car and a salesman who regularly updated 
            his car became lethargic on long trips. (<A

            cut by 20% within a few years, while nitrogen pollution from farms 
            could drive some plants extinct.</B> British scientists have 
            identified two new air pollution threats to Britain which could wipe 
            out vulnerable plant species, cut some crop yields by 20%, and 
            affect human health. Traffic fumes and industrial pollution from as 
            far away as the U.S., China and India are threatening to permanently 
            push ozone levels in the lower atmosphere over the danger limit. 
            Southern England is particularly vulnerable because ozone is already 
            close to the danger threshold because of home grown pollution from 
            cars and factories. Staple crops like wheat, potatoes, peas and 
            beans are all vulnerable to 20% declines in yield at relatively low 
            levels of ozone. 
            <P>Ozone pollution, caused by the action of sunlight on car and 
            factory emissions, has long been a problem in Europe. There has been 
            a programme of reducing emissions which caused dangerous peaks of 
            pollution in the summer, but the general background levels of ozone 
            continue to rise. This means that within a few years the levels of 
            ozone could be permanently above the levels where they begin to hurt 
            people's lungs and cause crop damage. 
            <P>David Fowler, chairman of the national expert group of 
            transboundary air pollution, said: "There is a cocktail of 
            pollutants which travel long distances. We have a common pool of air 
            across Europe, and now we have increasing background levels of 
            pollutants round the entire northern hemisphere. We need 
            international cooperation to stop them passing dangerous 
            thresholds." 
            <P>The second air pollution problem is caused principally by 
            industrial farming methods in Britain. Ammonia from slurry, which 
            rapidly breaks down into nitrogen, is blown in the wind and 
            deposited in wild places on upland areas of Britain, fertilising the 
            soil. In parts of the south west, Wales and Cumbria, nitrogen 
            deposits are 20 kilogrammes per hectare, 10 times above the natural 
            background. 
            <P>The problem is that the species that have adapted to live in 
            these poor soils, like heather, are overtaken by other species like 
            grass which thrive on fertiliser. Particularly vulnerable are 
            specialist plants like sundew, which supplements its diet by eating 
            insects. In a nitrogen rich world, it will be swamped by taller 
            invading plants. Already there is evidence that endangered plants 
            that live in poorer soils in nature reserves are being wiped out by 
            invaders. 
            <P>So concerned is Michael Meacher, the British environment 
            minister, about the new findings that he is to raise the matter with 
            fellow EU ministers at an meeting in Brussels. He said that a new 
            international agreement to cut ozone pollution, on the same lines at 
            the climate change convention, is required to tackle the threat. (<A

            <P><B>(12/07/2001) International study finds air pollution is 
            seriously weakening the Earth's water cycle - suppressing rainfall 
            and threatening world's already stressed fresh water supplies - and 
            increasing heating of the atmosphere.</B> Air pollution can reduceg 
            the global water supplies on which humans and other species depend, 
            according to a new study by an international team of researchers. 
            The study, based on results obtained during the international Indian 
            Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), found that tiny particles of soot and 
            other pollutants are having a far greater effect on the planet's 
            hydrological cycle than previously realized. 
            <P>Human activities are releasing tiny particles (aerosols) into the 
            atmosphere. These human-made aerosols enhance scattering and 
            absorption of solar radiation. They also produce brighter clouds 
            that are less efficient at releasing precipitation. These in turn 
            lead to large reductions in the amount of solar irradiance reaching 
            Earth's surface, a corresponding increase in solar heating of the 
            atmosphere, changes in the atmospheric temperature structure, 
            suppression of rainfall, and less efficient removal of pollutants. 
            These aerosol effects can lead to a weaker hydrological cycle, which 
            connects directly to availability and quality of fresh water, a 
            major environmental issue of the 21st century. 
            <P>If air pollutants are reducing the amount rain and snowfall, that 
            will directly affect the replenishment of the world's major stores 
            of freshwater, including lakes, groundwater supplies, glaciers and 
            high elevation snowpack. If humans continue to draw down these 
            stores at a faster rate than they are replenished, access to fresh 
            water could become the most crucial problem facing civilization. A 
            United Nations Population Fund report released November 7, 2001 
            found that water use has grown six-fold over the past 70 years. 
            "Water may be the resource that defines the limits of sustainable 
            development," that report noted. 
            <P>In the article in the journal Science, Ramanathan, Crutzen, J.T. 
            Kiehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Rosenfeld 
            of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, say the aerosol issues raised 
            by INDOEX are a "major environmental concern." 
            <P>"Initially we were seeing aerosols as mainly a cooling agent, 
            offsetting global warming. In this article we are saying that 
            perhaps an even bigger impact of aerosols is on the water budget of 
            the planet," said Scripps professor V. Ramanathan, who along with 
            professor Paul Crutzen, a coauthor of the new study, led the INDOEX 
            science team as co-chief scientists. 
            <P>"Through INDOEX we found that aerosols are cutting down sunlight 
            going into the ocean," added Ramanathan. "The energy for the 
            hydrological cycle comes from sunlight. As sunlight heats the ocean, 
            water escapes into the atmosphere and falls out as rain. So as 
            aerosols cut down sunlight by large amounts, they may be spinning 
            down the hydrological cycle of the planet." 
            <P>The fourth co-author of the paper, Daniel Rosenfeld, also notes 
            that these aerosol particulates may be suppressing rain over 
            polluted regions. Within clouds, aerosols can limit the size of 
            cloud droplets, stifling the development of the larger droplets 
            required for raindrops. 
            <P>"One of the key revelations from INDOEX is that air pollution is 
            not only an industrial phenomenon," said Scripps professor Crutzen, 
            a 1995 Nobel Laureate. "The part of the atmosphere that you would 
            expect to be the cleanest - the areas without a lot of 
            industrialization - in fact can be very highly polluted, especially 
            during the dry season." 
            <P>The team not only questions the role aerosols are playing on the 
            regional and global water cycle, but they also suggest that aerosol 
            pollution increases the solar heating of the atmosphere, and reduces 
            the solar heating of the surface of the planet. These effects maybe 
            comparable to the global warming effects of greenhouse gases, the 
            team argues. 
            <P>"Part of these results are important for creating awareness," 
            said Crutzen. "The biomass burning in the countries that are 
            producing this pollution cannot go on." 
            <P>The INDOEX project involved more than 150 scientists across 
            several disciplines from Austria, France, Germany, India, Maldives, 
            the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. The $25 million 
            project, funded in part by the National Aeronautics and Space 
            Administration (NASA), focused on the Indian Ocean region in a 
            multiplatform analysis using satellites, aircraft, ships, surface 
            stations and balloons. The project was designed to assess the nature 
            and magnitude of the chemical pollution over the tropical Indian 
            Ocean and to evaluate the environmental significance of the region's 
            aerosols. 
            <P>Early in the project, INDOEX researchers documented a human 
            produced brownish gray haze layer of about 10 million square 
            kilometers over the Indian-Asian region. The particles within the 
            haze, the researchers discovered, were causing a three-fold decrease 
            in solar radiation reaching the earth's surface as compared with the 
            top of the atmosphere. The aerosols, typically in the submicrometer- 
            to micrometer-size range, were a mixture of sulfates, nitrates, 
            organic particles, fly ash, and mineral dust, formed by fossil fuel 
            combustion and burning of forests and other biomass. 
            <P>The immediate next step, the authors say, is to develop a 
            reliable global inventory of aerosol emission rates, life times and 
            concentrations. Integrating new satellite observations, field 
            experiments and laboratory studies with computer models will pave 
            the way for breakthroughs in scientific understanding of aerosols 
            and how they are modifying the environment, they say. 
            <P>The study was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the 
            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA and the 
            National Science Foundation. (<A

            <P>(11/28/2001) Researchers find "disturbing changes" in lung x-rays 
            and CT scans of children exposed to chronic air pollution even when 
            they are apparently healthy. Exposure to air polluted by cars, 
            planes and factories causes physical changes in the lungs of 
            otherwise apparently healthy children, researchers report. Past 
            research has found that children living in polluted areas have 
            higher rates of lung diseases such as asthma. But the new study is 
            the first to use X-ray imaging to measure changes in children with 
            no symptoms of lung problems, the researchers said. 
            <P>Dr. Lynn Ansley Fordham, an associate professor of radiology and 
            chief of pediatric imaging at the University of North Carolina 
            School of Medicine, said she found the "disturbing changes" in chest 
            x-rays of 241 healthy children living in Mexico City, compared with 
            those of 19 children living in a small, relatively unpolluted 
            coastal town in Mexico. Fordham said that Dr. Lilian 
            Calderon-Garciduenas of the National Institute of Pediatrics in 
            Mexico City asked her to study the x-rays because 
            Calderon-Garciduenas was concerned about the health risks of 
            pollution. 
            <P>All of the children included in the study had no known lung 
            diseases, and did not have allergies or asthma. They also did not 
            have other risk factors for respiratory problems, such as exposure 
            to tobacco smoke in their homes. The children were from middle-class 
            families, had nutritious diets, access to health care and were 
            normal weight at birth - all factors that make lung problems 
            unlikely. "They ought to be healthy, and they ought to be normal, 
            but they're not," said Fordham. 
            <P>Chest X-rays of all the children were examined by two experts 
            specializing in children's X-rays who scored the images using 
            standardized scales of lung expansion and marks within the lungs. 
            The regular X-rays found children living in Mexico City were far 
            more likely to have abnormal X-rays: 151 (63%) showed over-expansion 
            (hyperinflation) of the lungs, and 126 (52%) had abnormally high 
            levels of markings in their lungs. Interstitial markings are fine 
            lines that can indicate inflammation along the airways, Fordham 
            said. 
            <P>Moreover, two children had tiny growths called nodules on their 
            lungs. In the coastal town, only one child had mild over-inflation 
            of the lungs, and the rest of the coastal children had no damage. 
            <P>Twenty-five children with the "most abnormal x-rays" were also 
            evaluated using computed tomography (CT) scans. The CT scans 
            revealed mild thickening of the walls of bronchial airways in 10 
            children, while 8 had "trapped air in their lungs" and 4 had 
            enlarged central airways. 
            <P>Such lung damage can be a precursor to problems such as pulmonary 
            disease. Fordham said that the findings do not indicate disease per 
            se, but she said, "the findings do suggest that these children are 
            at risk for developing chronic lung diseases." 
            <P>"It suggests that air pollution can cause lung disease in these 
            kids. These kids might go on to have long-term lung disease, like 
            chronic obstructive pulmonary disease," said Fordham. 
            <P>Joel Schwartz, an environmental epidemiologist at Harvard's 
            School of Public Health, said other research has indirectly linked 
            air pollution with respiratory ailments. But to find radiographic 
            evidence of lung abnormalities in seemingly healthy children "is 
            pretty unusual," he said. 
            <P>The results "are showing what we suspect - that there are chronic 
            effects that can be seen in the lung that would show up this early 
            ... on X-ray," said Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. 
            Some of the changes, such as airway thickening, might disappear if 
            the children moved to a less polluted area, "but it would certainly 
            take a long time to reverse," Schwartz said. 
            <P>Throughout the 20-month study, smog levels in Mexico City 
            exceeded U.S. air quality standards for more than four hours a day 
            on average. Particulate matter - tiny pieces of soot and other 
            materials in the air - also was above U.S. standards. But although 
            Mexico City is more polluted than U.S. cities, the results can be 
            generalized to other polluted areas, Fordham said, noting that 
            "regions such as Southern California, the Ohio Valley, and the 
            Northeast corridor between Boston and New York have pollution that 
            is significant enough to be worrisome." 
            <P>"You have to wonder what's happening to the kids here in the 
            United States," Fordham added. 
            <P>Fordham also raises questions about a pollution link to the 
            growing number of children with asthma. She notes that U.S. children 
            are also exposed to more indoor air pollution, such as off-gassing 
            from rugs and other synthetic materials, tobacco smoke, and molds 
            and mildews. She said her findings raise the issue of how public 
            policy should tackle air pollution levels. "Despite the cost, we 
            need to focus on efforts to reduce air pollution. It's going to be a 
            huge, long-term impact on society." 
            <P>Since the study looked at middle-class children, who have health 
            advantages, Fordham said, "you have to be very concerned about how 
            low-income kids will handle the air pollution exposure." 
            <P>Fordham said a study on euthanized dogs in Mexico found that 
            those from moderately polluted areas - similar to some areas of the 
            United States - had thickening of the lungs' lining, inflammation 
            and particulate matter lodged in the lungs. The findings might be 
            more severe in dogs because of their poor diets, but "we presume the 
            same things could be found in people," said Fordham, adding that 
            another study of children in a moderately polluted city is planned. 
            <P>Fordham said it would be difficult to duplicate the study in the 
            United States because of the high rates of asthma and higher levels 
            of indoor air pollution from such things as carpet and glues, which 
            could skew the results. It also was easier to find Mexican children 
            who had lived in the same neighborhood all their lives. (<A

            <P><B>(11/27/2001) Study finds high levels of toxic platinum, 
            palladium, and rhodium from catalytic converters are accumulating 
            along roadsides.</B> Catalytic converters - the devices on cars that 
            keep certain pollutants from the engine from reaching the air - are 
            spewing out other toxic substances that are building up along U.S. 
            roads. Mark Schneegurt, an assistant professor in biological 
            sciences at Wichita State University, and a four person team from 
            the University of Notre Dame have conducted one of the most 
            comprehensive U.S. studies of roadside contamination by catalytic 
            converters. Their study was published in the American Chemical 
            Society's journal "Environmental Science &amp; Technology." 
            <P>Catalytic converters have been used on U.S. cars since 1978 to 
            turn toxic pollutants such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into 
            less harmful emissions through chemical reactions. The material used 
            to speed up those reactions is filled with platinum, palladium and 
            rhodium, known collectively as platinum-group elements or PGEs. 
            Platinum group metals have been dubbed the noble metals because of 
            their high resistance to oxidation and corrosion. 
            <P>But scientists have found that platinum-group elements are 
            emitted as microscopic particles from a vehicle's tailpipe. The 
            level and rate of PGE release vary according to how fast a vehicle 
            is travelling and the type of engine. 
            <P>Enough platinum-group elements are being throw off from vehicles 
            with catalytic converters that they are building up to potentially 
            harmful levels along roadsides as far as 55 yards from the roads, 
            the study showed. The researchers collected soil samples from urban 
            roads and side streets in and around South Bend, Indiana. They also 
            went to several sites along Interstate 80 between South Bend and 
            Chicago, collecting roadside samples and soil samples at distances 
            16, 32 and 160 feet from the roadway. 
            <P>"There's so much of it that it's almost worth it to mine the top 
            inch of roadside dust" for the three elements, said Schneegurt. 
            <P>The metals, especially palladium, can accumulate in plants and 
            animals, and thereby enter the food chain. Platinum is a particular 
            concern as it has known mutagenic and toxic effects even at 
            exceedingly low concentrations, in urban air (affecting human 
            health) and urban water (affecting ecosystem health). Suspected 
            biomethylation of platinum in the aquatic urban environment gives a 
            similar concern to that attached to mercury. However, so far there 
            have been only a few isolated studies of the impacts of platinum and 
            other platinum group netals (PGMs) such as rhodium and palladium on 
            urban and roadside environments. 
            <P>Platinum is also highly allergenic. If people are consistently 
            exposed to certain allergens at even low levels they can develop 
            allergies that can lead to asthma, or they can experience other 
            symptoms such as sensitive skin. Not enough research has been done 
            on palladium and rhodium to determine how harmful they are,

            U.S. roads cut through agricultural areas, Schneegurt notes. It is 
            not known if these elements are getting into groundwater supplies or 
            the wildlife and human food chains. 
            <P>There is also the potential for even more platinum-group elements 
            to be emitted in places far removed from highways. Catalytic

            <P><B>(11/16/2001) New research finds "clear evidence that current 
            levels of air pollution are damaging the lungs of children across 
            the UK."</B> Small particles found in diesel exhaust fumes can 
            penetrate into the lungs of children, according to new research 
            published in the British Thoracic Society journal Thorax. Scientists 
            say the study offers conclusive evidence that particles from diesel 
            exhaust reach, and are taken up by, cells that reside on the deepest 
            part of the lung. 
            <P>Dr. Jonathan Grigg and his team at the Institute for Lung Health 
            at the University of Leicester looked for particles in cells sampled 
            from the lungs of 22 healthy children - and found evidence of diesel 
            particles in them all. The level of particles was significantly 
            higher in children living on a main road, although there was no 
            difference in the proportion of these particlesin children of 
            different ages. 
            <P>PM10 are tiny particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter. 
            Their small size allows them to penetrate deep into the lung, where 
            they can aggravate respiratory disease. The UK government estimates 
            that 24,000 deaths of adults a year can be attributed to the 
            inhalation of PM10. 
            <P>Grigg said: "This research, which shows particles in cells that 
            are known to cause lung injury, supports epidemiological studies 
            which demonstrate an adverse effect of particles on the respiratory 
            health of children. PM10 are one of the most damaging pollutants and 
            can penetrate far into the lungs - causing inflammation, coughing, 
            respiratory symptoms and even permanent damage. This biological 
            evidence is very important in furthering our understanding of air 
            pollution and its effects." 
            <P>Dr. John Harvey, of the British Thoracic Society, said: "This 
            research is clear evidence that current levels of air pollution are 
            damaging the lungs of children across the UK. We urge the government 
            and other bodies to fund long-term studies so we can further probe 
            avoidable causes of lung damage in children - and find solutions. We 
            owe it to future generations to help them breathe easier." (<A

            <P><B>(11/16/2001) Study finds air is polluted with more 
            lung-damaging "nanoparticles" than previously thought; some emission 
            control technologies actually produce more damaging ultrafine 
            particles in the process of reducing larger particulate 
            emissions.</B> Tiny airborne particles that are too small to see are 
            more plentiful and pose a greater health hazard than previously 
            thought, says an Oak Ridge National Laboratory researcher studying 
            airborne particles in the Great Smoky Mountains and beyond. 
            <P>Recent scientific evidence indicates that even a relatively small 
            increase in the concentration of particulate matter of 10 
            micrometers or less - a tenth the diameter of a human hair - results 
            in a small but consistent increase in death rates and illnesses 
            caused by impacts on the cardiopulmonary system. Particles smaller 
            than a couple of hundred nanometers generally come from manmade 
            emission sources such as engine combustion. One micrometer is equal 
            to 1,000 nanometers. Photochemical reactions involving air 
            pollutants in the atmosphere can also yield small particles that can 
            undergo changes in size, shape and chemical composition. 
            <P>Mengdawn Cheng of the Environmental Sciences Division is tracking 
            and characterizing the "nanoparticles" in the Smokies and 29 other 
            sites. He is also examining their toxicity in a process called 
            "direct cell deposition," which was developed by his team. The 
            technique differs from other approaches that involve collecting 
            particles in a solution and then instilling the particles to 
            animals. 
            <P>"We believe that the instillation approach changes particle 
            properties, size, shape and chemical composition, for example, and 
            therefore we think such a practice does not allow us to study the 
            toxicity of the right particles," Cheng said. 
            <P>Cheng뭩 research involves exposing cells directly to engine 
            exhaust, which poses a challenge and had never been done. Cheng and 
            colleagues are especially interested in the health effects resulting 
            from exposure to nanoparticles typically produced by internal 
            combustion and turbine engines and other sources. 
            <P>Cheng and his co-workers exposed primed and normal human lung 
            cells to synthetic particles and chemically complex particles 
            produced by an internal combustion engine. They discovered that the 
            acute toxicological responses of the primed cells - those that 
            simulate human lungs that are injured or predisposed to lung 
            conditions - were high compared to that of the normal cells. Through 
            measurements, the researchers also discovered that particles 
            containing several chemical pollutants are more toxic to normal 
            cells than particles containing a single pollutant. 
            <P>In another project, Cheng and collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley 
            National Laboratory, Washington University in St. Louis and the 
            Medical School of (Toledo) Ohio tracked and characterized particles 
            of less than 1 micrometer. The fine particles consist of tiny solid 
            or liquid droplets - or both - suspended in the air. Air polluting 
            particulate matter ranges in size from a few nanometers to several 
            hundred micrometers, and Cheng noted that the smallest particles 
            have a very different chemical composition than larger particles. 
            Also, new emission control technologies can do a good job of 
            removing large particles but can do very little about the ultrafine 
            particles. And some technologies produce even more ultrafine 
            particles in the process of reducing emissions of particulate 
            matter. 
            <P>Nanoparticles behave aerodynamically like gas molecules and have 
            a larger surface area, per unit mass, than large particles. As a 
            result, environmental nanoparticles can penetrate deeper inside 
            human lungs and cause more harm than larger particles because of the 
            increased particle surface area, Cheng said. 
            <P>Particles smaller than a couple of hundred nanometers generally 
            come from manmade emissions involving high temperatures, energetic 
            reactions or both. These particles are extremely dynamic, varying 
            with time, and are difficult to measure. They can travel 2,000 miles 
            or more. (<A

            <P><B>(10/26/2001) Release of test results under Freedom of 
            Information Act finally forces U.S. EPA to admit that toxic 
            chemicals and metals - including dioxins, PCBs, benzene, asbestos, 
            and lead - from World Trade Center attack are contaminating air, 
            soil and Hudson River at levels far exceeding safety standards.</B> 
            After weeks of official denials of any problem, U.S. Environmental 
            Protection Agency (EPA) documents obtained under a Freedom of 
            Information Act request show that toxic chemicals and metals are 
            being released from fires and rubble in the ruins of the World Trade 
            Center at levels that sometimes far exceed U.S. government safety 
            standards. Toxins including benzene, chlorinated dioxins, 
            polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chromium, copper, lead, and sulfur 
            oxide have been found in the air and soil in lower Manhattan. EPA 
            monitoring devices also have found considerable contaminants in the 
            Hudson River - in the water and in the sediment - especially after 
            it rains. 
            <P>Fires still burning beneath the wreckage - six weeks after the 
            attacks on the twin towers - are also releasing relatively high 
            levels of benzene, a colorless liquid that evaporates quickly and 
            can cause leukemia, bone marrow damage and other diseases in 
            long-term exposure, the environmental law group said in its analysis 
            of the EPA data. But the EPA documents reveal that the standard has 
            been exceeded by considerable margins. On October 2, for example, 
            benzene levels from three spots around Ground Zero were measured at 
            42, 31 and 16 times higher than the OSHA standard. On October 12, 
            one reading measured 21 times higher. The highest benzene level was 
            recorded October 11 - 58 times higher than OSHA's permissible 
            exposure limit. 
            <P>Until now, public attention has focused largely on the potential 
            hazards of asbestos in the air. But the EPA records reveal that the 
            release of toxic chemicals from the collapse of the twin towers and 
            the subsequent subterranean fires has been far more extensive than 
            first believed. Among the findings contained in the EPA documents: 
            <P>* Water discharged into the Hudson River from a sewer pipe at 
            Rector Street on September 18 showed dioxin levels more than five 
            times higher than any previously recorded in New York Harbor by the 
            state Department of Environmental Conservation. Monitors also found 
            PCBs and dioxin levels in river sediment that were several times 
            higher than a previous study of the river done in 1993. 
            <P>A test of toxic metals in water discharged into the Hudson showed 
            chromium, copper, lead and zinc at levels "elevated to several 
            orders of magnitude above ambient water-quality criteria for most 
            metals," according to the state monitoring agent who conducted the 
            test. 
            <P>On September 23, lead levels in the air at three sites in lower 
            Manhattan - Barclay and West Streets., Church and Dey Streets. and 
            at Ground Zero - registered above the EPA standard for ambient air 
            quality. At Barclay and West, the level of lead in the air was 
            nearly three times the EPA standard. Exposure to lead can damage the 
            central nervous system, kidneys and other organs. 
            <P>On numerous days, sulfur dioxide readings in the air at a 
            half-dozen sites in lower Manhattan have been far higher than the 
            EPA's ambient air quality standards. High levels of sulfur dioxide 
            can aggravate health problems for asthmatics or people with 
            respiratory problems and trigger allergic reactions in others. On 
            September 18, sulfur dioxide levels were so high that, according to 
            one industrial hygienist, they were above the EPA's standard for a 
            classification of "hazardous." 
            <P>"What I've seen of the data is troubling," said Paul Bartlett, an 
            expert on PCBs and dioxins at the Queens College Center for the 
            Biology of Natural Systems. He added that in his opinion, whatever 
            monitoring the EPA has conducted has been inadequate. 
            <P>"Their detection limits are aimed at threshold levels for 
            occupational exposure," Bartlett said. "They aren't treating this as 
            a disaster, so they're not asking what extent and how far are people 
            being exposed or who is possibly being affected by the releases of 
            chemicals. They're just checking what emissions are exceeding 
            regulations." 
            <P>"I don't know how the government defines a Superfund site," 
            Bartlett said. "But I'd certainly treat Ground Zero like one." 
            <P>"I'm most concerned about the soup effect of all these toxic 
            chemicals," said Monona Rossol, an industrial hygienist who works 
            with the Environmental Law and Justice Project. "No one's worrying 
            about the combination of these things on the workers." 
            <P>Faced with the release of the documents, which contradict 
            repeated previous assurances that no pollutant aside from asbestos - 
            such as volatile organics, heavy metals and dioxin - has been 
            detected at unsafe levels, the EPA is now admitting that toxic 
            chemical levels are more extensive than reported. "Yes, they are 
            high," acknowledged EPA spokeswoman Mary Mears. 
            <P>Joel Kupferman, of the law and justice project, said his group is 
            considering litigation against federal health groups for failing to 
            stress the potential danger of the air quality. "The workers and the 
            safety people needed this information," said Kupferman, referring to 
            the tests performed in September and early October. 
            <P>The twin towers spouted immense plumes of smoke when they were 
            attacked, and scattered debris for miles when they fell. Now, the 
            shadows of surrounding buildings are still stark against a thick 
            haze of dust. Even half a mile away, the sun peers weakly through 
            the airborne debris. Further afield, an ill wind can still send 
            pedestrians scuttling for refuge from the acrid smell emanating from 
            downtown Manhattan. Depending on the wind direction, the air is 
            still dusty. Smoke still curls from the ruins. And an acrid odor 
            still hangs over the area. 
            <P>In the financial district surrounding "ground zero," office 
            workers say they are concerned about the "toxic zone" and breathing 
            in the gritty, acrid, smelly air daily that still hangs over them 
            more than 6 weeks after the attacks. "We work in a toxic zone. So 
            when you ask what do people think down here, they certainly don't 
            think of gold," said a precious metals broker at the COMEX metals 
            division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a stone's throw from 
            the wreckage. 
            <P>"That's all anyone is talking about," said the broker, who asked 
            not to be identified. 
            <P>During several days in October, when people were returning to the 
            downtown area, EPA data also show that sulfur dioxide gas in the air 
            was at a level that generally triggers public warnings to asthmatics 
            and people with heart problems to stay indoors, according to the 
            environmental-law group. 
            <P>Officials have always been most concerned about construction 
            workers and firefighters at the site clearing the debris, and they 
            are required to wear respirators to avoid breathing in the acrid 
            air. 
            <P>One of the greatest fears for local residents and workers is that 
            levels of airborne asbestos are not dropping with the passing days. 
            So-called "spikes" are occurring in the air quality readings being 
            taken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which exceed the 
            legal level for asbestos content (0.01 fibres per cubic centimetre 
            of air). 
            <P>"There absolutely is an asbestos hazard for the workers and I 
            think everyone who's involved agrees," said asbestos expert Dr. 
            Philip Landrigan, chairman of the department of community and 
            preventive medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 
            Manhattan. Landrigan said "small fibers are more dangerous for the 
            simple reason that they go deeper down into the lungs." 
            <P>When the center was built in the early 1970s, asbestos was 
            applied as insulation to steel beams up to the 39th floor of Tower 
            One before a ban on the use of the mineral took effect in 1971. The 
            towers' collapse is thought to have launched the fibers into the 
            air, particles so small that painters' masks have little 
            effectiveness in filtering them out. 
            <P>Examination of the dust by a private company found surprisingly 
            large numbers of ultra-thin fibers, 10,000 times thinner than a 
            human hair, inside buildings up to three blocks away from the site 
            where the towers crumbled and more than 5,000 people killed in the 
            attack by hijacked civilian aircraft. A report by toxicologists at 
            the company, HP Environmental Inc. of Herndon, Virginia, said 
            laboratory tests from samples collected Sept. 21-28 showed the 
            destruction of the buildings "created an asbestos fiber size 
            distribution not previously encountered," which it said the EPA 
            tests may not be picking up. 
            <P>Nearby Manahattan resident Tess O'Dwer wears a sophisticated 
            respirator. "My father died of asbestosis [scarring of the lungs by 
            exposure to the fibres]. I know there is no such thing as a 'safe' 
            level of asbestos in the air," she said 
            <P>Near O'Dwer's home on nearby West Street, monitoring equipment 
            registered 0.05 fibers per cubic centimeter of asbestos in the week 
            after the attacks. This level fell, but then surged to more than 
            eight times the safe limit on September 29. 
            <P>Like many who brave the streets around the financial district, 
            O'Dwer says she has experienced headaches and a persistent sore 
            throat since September 11. Although her apartment has been 
            professionally cleaned since the attack, O'Dwer says the odour 
            inside is still so strong that she will not return home until 
            another clean-up team goes in. 
            <P>Kathryn Freed, city councilor for the First District, which 
            covers all of Lower Manhattan, says the sight and smell of the 
            constant dust clouds are "decidedly worrisome" to her constituents. 
            The sealing of her windows, a professional clean-up and the purchase 
            of air purifiers have not stopped Freed succumbing to the same 
            symptoms which dog many locals. "I have a headache right now," she 
            said. 
            <P>"Even with closed windows, the dust seems to sneak its way into 
            the house through the cracks. You clean and the next day the white 
            film of dust is back," Freed says. "There's no point in using a 
            normal vacuum cleaner. The filters won't catch asbestos and you 
            merely succeed in making the fibres airborne again." 
            <P>Freed says the work of clearing and transporting the debris from 
            the site is responsible for disturbing and distributing the dust. "I 
            don't think they are wetting down the debris in the trucks as much 
            as they say they are, because dust still seems to be flowing out as 
            they drive past. Perhaps they should be putting the debris in sealed 
            containers. After all, the dock where they load the rubble onto 
            barges is right next to Stuyvesant High School." 
            <P>Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for 
            Occupational Safety and Health, says that any exposure to asbestos 
            can cause cancer. "There's no threshold limit, although the greater 
            your exposure to the fibres, the greater at risk you are. I'd say 
            that since the fibers are more quickly disbursed in the open air, 
            the risk is low. But it's a bit of a leap to say it is safe." 
            <P>"You have to remember that even before September 11 and even on a 
            good day, there was always asbestos in New York's air," he added. 
            <P>HP Environmental principal Piotr Chmielinski said the methods of 
            cleaning up dust residue in apartments, offices and schools in the 
            area were especially important. "You do that by moist or lightly wet 
            wiping of the surface and vacuuming areas only with High Efficiency 
            Particle Air filters which can capture 0.3 micron particles and this 
            way you can be sure the dust is not recirculated," Chmielinski said. 

            <P>However, the particles found measured as little as 0.25 microns 
            in width, said Chmielinski, meaning even HEPA filters may not 
            capture all of the asbestos. 
            <P>Meanwhile, more than 4,000 firefighters who have been clearing 
            the devastated site of the World Trade Center bombings are suffering 
            from an array of respiratory problems, including sinus infections, 
            scratchy throats, dry coughs, dull headaches, asthma attacks, and 
            chest pain as excavation of the massive pile of debris in Lower 
            Manhattan continues to spew tiny particles and chemical vapors into 
            the air. The condition has been dubbed 'World Trade Center cough' by 
            the New York City's fire department. Fire commissioner Thomas Von 
            Essen said about 20% of the firefighters have persistent coughing 
            from dust at the site, which includes pulverised concrete. 
            <P>One firefighter has been treated for allergic alveolitis, a rare 
            lung inflammation, and a Wall Street Journal editor who works near 
            ground zero has developed a life-threatening autoimmune disease from 
            ingesting the dust. 
            <P>Dr. David Prezant, the chief pulmonary physician for the fire 
            department, says it is common for firefighters to have a brief spell 
            of coughing after attending a fire. But he said many of the 
            firefighters who worked around-the-clock at ground zero are still 
            suffering symptoms six weeks after the disaster. 
            <P>The firefighters have been given steroid inhalants to treat 
            coughing and heaviness in the chest. The treatment aims to ease 
            inflammation and reduce the coughs, and is generally given to people 
            with asthma or chronic bronchitis. 
            <P>Prezant said 370 firefighters have been fully examined and given 
            chest X-rays. Up to 10,000 check-ups could take place within a 
            month, he said. Prezant added: "We know medically that from inhaling 
            large particulate matter, the consequences can range from chronic 
            cough to asthma to a higher incidence of heart attacks." 
            <P>Thomas Manley, the health and safety officer for the Uniformed 
            Firefighters Association, said: "My level of concern is high. We do 
            not know what we may have inhaled in the opening stages of the 
            operation." 
            <P>An unknown number of others, caught in the toxic dust storm after 
            the towers fell or just living or working nearby, have symptoms 
            similar to the firefighters, which specialists attribute to 
            breathing in fine particles, such as soot and concrete dust. 
            <P>"It feels like your throat is coated with a fine, fine dust some 
            days if you are outside a long time," said Jennifer Poulous, a 
            graduate student who lives nine blocks from the World Trade Center. 
            "It's not all the time, but sometimes when the wind shifts, my eyes 
            burn." 
            <P>Doctors say there is little research on the effect of dust 
            exposure on pregnant women or the very young, and virtually no 
            research on how the mixing of so many chemicals changes their 
            effect. "You can get synergetic effectswhen you mix these things," 
            said John Wagner, a chemical engineer from the Texas A&amp;M 
            University who has written to the New York City Fire Department 
            warning of health concerns about the fires that still burn 
            underground. "As far as I know," Wagner said, "a lot of the 
            materials we are dealing with don't have a permissible exposure 
            level. You have a whole gamut of terrible compounds that are coming 
            off. The fact is we don't know enough about these materials that are 
            going into the air." 
            <P>Toxic definitions from the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and 
            Disease Registry (ATSDR):

            evaporates into the air quickly, benzene is a highly flammable 
            carcinogen. Breathing benzene can cause drowsiness, dizziness, 
            confusion, headaches, rapid heart rate, vomiting, infection or 
            tremors. Long-term exposure affects bone marrow and can cause anemia 
            and leukemia. Breathing very high levels can cause death.

            <P><B>(10/26/2001) Report finds airplanes are major sources of urban 
            air pollution and global warming-causing greenhouse gases.</B> Not 
            only do aeroplanes emit greenhouse gases high in the atmosphere, 
            making a disproportionate contribution to global warming, but 
            airports are also major emitters of pollution, according to a new 
            report into world travel. 
            <P>One of the most significant environmental concerns arising from 
            the increases in both passenger and freight air transport in recent 
            years, is that most airports are located in or near major cities, 
            says the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
            in its Mobility 2001 report. Urban residents are affected by noise, 
            pollution and congestion arising from airport developments. 
            <P>As well as emissions from aircraft that are idling on the runway, 
            taxiing, landing or taking off, vehicles used by passengers and 
            airport services contribute to make airports major pollution 
            emitters. For example, Kennedy airport is a bigger source of 
            volatile organic compounds and nitrous oxides than the Hudson Avenue 
            power plant in New York, and Los Angeles airport is the second 
            largest producer of industrial smog in the region. Noise also has 
            significant effects on health, quality of life, and property prices, 
            says the report. 
            <P>Air travel is expected to grow rapidly in the years to come, 
            especially in the developing world, a WBCSD spokesperson said. WBCSD 
            also notes that although high speed rail links can compete with up 
            to 1.5 hours of flight time in Western Europe and in part of the US, 
            there is little chance of curbing the growth in air travel elsewhere 
            and for longer flight times. 
            <P>Although aircraft size is generally increasing, pollution is 
            exacerbated in places such as the US through demand for conveniently 
            scheduled departure times and a range of return options from the 
            less price-sensitive business travellers, which has led to the use 
            of smaller aircraft, which are scheduled more frequently. (<A

            million in damage to food crops every year in Japan's Kanto 
            region.</B> The damage to Japanese agricultural crops caused by 
            ozone - a poisonous compound commonly found in smog - amounts to an 
            estimated 20 billion yen (approx. US$166,457,000) every year in the 
            Kanto region alone, according to Shizuoka University researchers 
            Toshimasa Ohara, a professor of atmospheric environment engineering, 
            and Kensaku Takagi, a graduate student at Shizuoka University. 
            <P>Ozone, a blue gaseous oxygen compound most often created when 
            automobile exhaust is exposed to sunlight, has been blamed for the 
            death of forests. Ohara and Takagi studied the impact of ozone on 
            rice, spinach and six other agricultural crops in the Tokyo 
            metropolitan area and six prefectures in Kanto by studying crop 
            yields and ozone density and comparing them with those grown 
            experimentally and exposed to ozone in greenhouse settings. They 
            then computed the degree of damage on the basis of the unit price 
            for those crops in each prefecture. 
            <P>The most extensive damage was found in Ibaraki Prefecture, which 
            lost an estimated 7 billion yen ($58,286,000), followed by Chiba at 
            4.7 billion yen ($39,137,000). In Gunma, damage to crops totaled an 
            estimated 3.5 billion yen ($29,147,000), while it came to 3.4 
            billion yen ($28,316,000) in Tochigi and 2.8 billion yen 
            ($23,319,000) in Saitama. The report says even though the yield of 
            crops in Gunma was less than in Saitama, the greater concentration 
            of ozone resulted in larger damage to Gunma's crops. 
            <P>In terms of crops, rice suffered the heaviest damage - an 
            estimated 11.3 billion yen ($94,118,000) - across the entire region,

            caused by air pollution to cardiopulmonary disease.</B> 
            Proinflammatory cell messengers caused by atmospheric pollutants 
            could play an important role in cardiopulmonary disease, according 
            to a new study. Canadian scientists report that tiny atmospheric 
            particles (PM10) and other forms of acute atmospheric pollution 
            stimulate large scavenger cells in the tiny air sacs of the lung 
            (alveolar macrophages) to produce proinflammatory intercellular 
            messengers called cytokines which they believe play an important 
            role in increased cardiopulmonary illness and mortality. 
            <P>Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association 
            between exposure to tiny ambient air particles and greater illness 
            and death from cardiopulmonary disease. 
            <P>The researchers cite alveolar macrophages as the most likely link 
            between the lung inflammation process caused by air pollution and 
            the human systemic response because these cells are responsible for 
            ingesting and clearing inhaled particles. 
            <P>Writing in the American Thoracic Society's peer-reviewed American 
            Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Stephen F. van 
            Eeden, M.D., of the Pulmonary Research Laboratory, University of 
            British Columbia in Canada measured the proinflammatory cytokines 
            produced by human alveolar macrophages exposed to ambient 
            atmospheric particles of different composition and size. The 
            cytokines produced by the alveolar macrophages are a group of small, 
            short-lived proteins released by one cell to regulate the function 
            of another cell, thereby acting as intercellular messengers. 
            <P>"An intriguing aspect of the epidemiologic data is that the 
            particle health effects are also associated with disease of the 
            cardiovascular system that does not come in contact with the 
            particles," said Dr. van Eeden. 
            <P>The researchers studied serum samples from 30 healthy males, 19 
            to 24 years of age, taken at the time they fought serious fires in 
            Southeast Asia in 1997. They also incubated other human alveolar 
            macrophages with particle suspensions of residual oil fly ash, 
            ambient urban particles from a large Canadian city, inert carbon 
            particles and latex particles of various sizes. 
            <P>They found that the same cytokines that elicited a systemic 
            proinflammatory response when alveolar macrophages were exposed to 
            urban particles were present in the serum samples collected from the 
            young adult males during the hazy smoke period of serious Southeast 
            Asian fires. 
            <P>The researchers postulate that these cytokines contribute to the 
            systemic response caused by air pollution. They believe that further 
            studies are required to establish a clear link between circulating 
            cytokines and the adverse cardiopulmonary effects in susceptible 
            individuals exposed to air pollution. (<A

            <P><B>(09/25/2001) Researchers find children living on highly 
            trafficked roads have much lower levels of protective receptors on 
            macrophages in their lungs.</B> Car-exhaust pollutants seem to limit 
            the ability of children's lung cells to recognize and remove 
            bacteria, according to the results of a study presented at the 11th 
            European Respiratory Society Annual Congress. The findings may 
            explain why children living on busy main roads appear to have a 
            greater susceptibility to respiratory infections, said lead 
            researcher Dr. Hazel J. Bunn. 
            <P>Bunn, from the University of Leicester, UK, and colleagues looked 
            at cells called alveolar macrophages, which are defense cells within 
            the lungs that engulf inhaled foreign substances. They were 
            searching for a specific "scavenger" receptor on the surface of the 
            cells called MARCO. The MARCO receptor is involved in recognizing 
            certain particles and bacteria. 
            <P>The researchers sampled cells from the lungs of 48 healthy 
            children aged 4 to 14, with varying exposures to car traffic. They 
            found a much lower expression of MARCO on alveolar macrophages taken 
            from children living on either a residential or main road, compared 
            with children living on a quiet road. There was no correlation 
            between MARCO expression and the children's age. 
            <P>Just how traffic pollutants might decrease MARCO receptors - and 
            the ultimate effect of the reduction - is not clear. Bunn said the 
            receptor decrease might be a protective mechanism that prevents 
            macrophages from being overwhelmed with particles. A larger study is 
            needed to better understand what is going on, according to Bunn. "We 
            need to get a better ... profile from a larger number of children," 
            she said. (<A

            <P><B>(09/21/2001) Scientists find that dangerous pollutants such as 
            DDT and PCBs can travel thousands of miles in the air, including to 
            the Arctic.</B> A team of geoscientists at Texas A&amp;M's 
            Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) came to these 
            conclusions while studying how pollutants such as polynuclear 
            aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and polychlorinated 
            biphenyls (PCBs) are transported in the atmosphere to Galveston and 
            Corpus Christi bays and removed by rain and dust. The scientists 
            also studied how gaseous pollutants are exchanged between the air 
            and water. 
            <P>The scientists found that air pollutants can be transported over 
            long distances instead of being trapped in the ocean or the soil, 
            and that gaseous water pollutants can evaporate into the atmosphere 
            instead of staying in the ocean. In both cases, the airborne 
            pollutants can lead to the depositing of pollutants long distances 
            from where they were produced or used. 
            <P>"Most scientists used to think that organic pollutants were not 
            present as gas in the air," A&amp;M researcher Terry Wade says. "To 
            our surprise, we have learned over the last 30 years that organic 
            pollutants can be in the vapor phase, which means that they can be 
            transported over long distances." 
            <P>For example, high levels of pesticides such as DDT, chlordane and 
            toxaphene are present in beluga whales from the Arctic, where they 
            were not used. "What we do here in Texas can affect what is 
            happening in the Arctic," Wade says. "We have added these 
            contaminants to the environment, and now we can see that they are 
            showing up in areas where we would not have expected them to be." 
            <P>To assess the whereabouts of the pollutants, Wade and his 
            collaborators used rain and air samplers that they installed close 
            to Galveston and Corpus Christi bays. "The general principle of the 
            experiments," Wade says, "is that you take a sample of air or rain 
            and you measure how much contaminant is present in the rain or in 
            the air. Then using models, you try to estimate the amount of 
            contaminants that are coming down into the bay." 
            <P>Wade and his collaborators collected pollutants in about 3,000 
            cubic meters of air and up to 120 liters of rain. Knowing the amount 
            of pollutant deposited in the samplers, the scientists estimated the 
            corresponding amounts that would enter the entire bay area. 
            <P>"To determine how much of some pollutants deposited in Corpus 
            Christi Bay during rain events," Wade says, "we analyzed the 
            rainfall events over more than a year's period and determined the 
            yearly amount of deposition in our sampler, then we estimated the 
            corresponding amount to the entire surface area of Corpus Christi 
            Bay." 
            <P>One of the most interesting results of the scientists' work is 
            related to the gas exchange between air and water. "Our most 
            surprising result is that there is a flux of contaminants currently 
            coming out of Corpus Christi Bay to the atmosphere," Wade says," 
            while we previously assumed that all the flux of contaminants would 
            be into the water." 
            <P>Wade suggests that PAH might come from the evaporation from small 
            petroleum spills. "In an area where we produce petroleum, there is 
            natural seepage and accidental releases," he says, "so if you spill 
            PAH in the ocean, a lot of it evaporates and then can be transported 
            long distances." 
            <P>The research also indicates that DDT and PCB evaporate into the 
            atmosphere and are transported over long distances. "Scientists 
            assumed that when you spray DDT on crops, the insecticides stay in 
            the soil. They might be washed into rivers when it rains and be 
            transported down rivers to coastal areas," Wade says. "To our 
            surprise, we discovered that the pesticide can volatilize into the 
            gaseous state and be transported in the air over long distances 
            fairly rapidly." (<A
