      <H3>History of the Federal Emergency Management Agency</H3><A 
      href="http://www.fema.gov/about/directors.htm">FEMA Directors</A> 
      <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency - an independent agency 
      reporting to the President and tasked with responding to, planning for, 
      recovering from and mitigating against disaster - can trace its beginnings 
      to the Congressional Act of 1803. This act, generally considered the first 
      piece of disaster legislation, provided assistance to a New Hampshire town 
      following an extensive fire. In the century that followed, ad hoc 
      legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, 
      earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.</P>
      <P>By the 1930s, when the federal approach to problems became popular, the 
      Reconstruction Finance Corporation was given authority to make disaster 
      loans for repair and reconstruction of certain public facilities following 
      an earthquake, and later, other types of disasters. In 1934, the Bureau of 
      Public Roads was given authority to provide funding for highways and 
      bridges damaged by natural disasters. The Flood Control Act, which gave 
      the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers greater authority to implement flood 
      control projects, was also passed. This piecemeal approach to disaster 
      assistance was problematic and it prompted legislation that required 
      greater cooperation between federal agencies and authorized the President 
      to coordinate these activities. </P>
      <P>The 1960s and early 1970s brought massive disasters requiring major 
      federal response and recovery operations by the Federal Disaster 
      Assistance Administration, established within the Department of Housing 
      and Urban Development (HUD). Hurricane Carla struck in 1962, Hurricane 
      Betsy in 1965, Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The 
      Alaskan Earthquake hit in 1964 and the San Fernando Earthquake rocked 
      Southern California in 1971. These events served to focus attention on the 
      issue of natural disasters and brought about increased legislation. In 
      1968, the National Flood Insurance Act offered new flood protection to 
      homeowners, and in 1974 the Disaster Relief Act firmly established the 
      process of Presidential disaster declarations. </P>
      <P>However, emergency and disaster activities were still fragmented. When 
      hazards associated with nuclear power plants and the transportation of 
      hazardous substances were added to natural disasters, more than 100 
      federal agencies were involved in some aspect of disasters, hazards and 
      emergencies. Many parallel programs and policies existed at the state and 
      local level, compounding the complexity of federal disaster relief 
      efforts. The National Governor's Association sought to decrease the many 
      agencies with whom state and local governments were forced work. They 
      asked President Jimmy Carter to centralize federal emergency 
functions.</P>
      <P>President Carter's 1979 executive order merged many of the separate 
      disaster-related responsibilities into a new Federal Emergency Management 
      Agency (FEMA). Among other agencies, FEMA absorbed: the Federal Insurance 
      Administration, the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, 
      the National Weather Service Community Preparedness Program, the Federal 
      Preparedness Agency of the General Services Administration and the Federal 
      Disaster Assistance Administration activities from HUD. Civil defense 
      responsibilities were also transferred to the new agency from the Defense 
      Department's Defense Civil Preparedness Agency. </P>
      <P>John Macy was named as FEMA's first director. Macy emphasized the 
      similarities between natural hazards preparedness and the civil defense 
      activities. FEMA began development of an Integrated Emergency Management 
      System with an all-hazards approach that included "direction, control and 
      warning systems which are common to the full range of emergencies from 
      small isolated events to the ultimate emergency - war." </P>
      <P>The new agency was faced with many unusual challenges in its first few 
      years that emphasized how complex emergency management can be. Early 
      disasters and emergencies included the contamination of Love Canal, the 
      Cuban refugee crisis and the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear 
      power plant. Later, the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989 and Hurricane 
      Andrew in 1992 focused major national attention on FEMA. In 1993, 
      President Clinton nominated James L. Witt as the new FEMA director. Witt 
      became the first agency director with experience as a state emergency 
      manager. He initiated sweeping reforms that streamlined disaster relief 
      and recovery operations, insisted on a new emphasis regarding preparedness 
      and mitigation, and focused agency employees on customer service. The end 
      of the Cold War also allowed Witt to redirect more of FEMA's limited 
      resources from civil defense into disaster relief, recovery and mitigation 
      programs. </P>
      <P>In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Joe M. Allbaugh as the 
      director of FEMA. Within months, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11th 
      focused the agency on issues of national preparedness and homeland 
      security, and tested the agency in unprecedented ways. The agency 
      coordinated its activities with the newly formed Office of Homeland 
      Security, and FEMA's Office of National Preparedness was given 
      responsibility for helping to ensure that the nation's first responders 
      were trained and equipped to deal with weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>Billions of dollars of new funding were directed to FEMA to help 
      communities face the threat of terrorism. Just a few years past its 20th 
      anniversary, FEMA was actively directing its "all-hazards" approach to 
      disasters toward homeland security issues.</P>
      <P>Today, FEMA - a 2,500-person agency supplemented by more than 5,000 
      stand-by disaster reservists - has a mission to lead America to prepare 
      for, prevent, respond to and recover from disasters with a vision of "A 
      Nation Prepared." At no time in its history has this vision been more 
      important to the country than in the aftermath of Sept. 11th.</P><!-- Footer Begins -->
