    <TD>Following are the remarks of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi 
      Annan on the occasion of the closing of the International Decade for 
      Natural Disaster Reduction, delivered at the International Conference 
      Center of Geneva on 5 July:
      <P>"As the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction draws to a 
      close we have achieved much, but we continue to confront major challenges. 
      It is a tragic irony that 1998, the penultimate year of the Disaster 
      Reduction Decade, was also a year in which natural disasters increased so 
      dramatically.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the International Decade has seen major achievements; 
      for that, the IDNDR team here in Geneva, and their partners in and outside 
      the UN system, deserve our gratitude.</P>
      <P>There have been major advances in scientific cooperation. Around the 
      world, an interdisciplinary scientific community of meteorologists, 
      geologists, seismologists and social scientists is working ever more 
      cohesively. Despite its limited financial resources, IDNDR has also 
      brought together governments, NGOs, other international organizations and 
      the private sector to work with the scientific community on 
      disaster-reduction strategies. </P>
      <P>Much has been learnt from the creative disaster-prevention efforts of 
      poor communities in developing countries.</P>
      <P>And yet, ladies and gentlemen, we confront a paradox. Despite a decade 
      of dedicated and creative effort by IDNDR and its collaborators, the 
      number and cost of natural disasters continues to rise.</P>
      <P>The cost of weather-related disasters in 1998 alone exceeded the cost 
      of all such disasters in the whole of the 1980s. Tens of thousands of 
      mostly poor people have died. Tens of millions have been temporarily or 
      permanently displaced.</P>
      <P>1998 was, in fact, a truly disastrous year.</P>
      <P>In the Caribbean, hurricanes George and Mitch killed more than 13,000. 
      In fact, Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years. A cyclone in 
      India in June got less publicity. But it caused comparable damage, and an 
      estimated 10,000 deaths.</P>
      <P>India, Nepal and Bangladesh were hit by major floods, with more than 
      four thousand killed. Two thirds of Bangladesh was inundated for months: 
      millions were made homeless. But the greatest single disaster of 1998 was 
      China's catastrophic Yangtze flood. Thousands were killed. Millions were 
      displaced. The cost has been estimated at 30 billion dollars – yes, 30 
      billion dollars.</P>
      <P>In Afghanistan, major earthquakes killed more than 9,000 people. In 
      Brazil, Indonesia and Siberia, fires ravaged tens of thousands of square 
      kilometres of forest.</P>
      <P>The developed states suffered far less; even so, a single ice storm in 
      January in Canada and the northeast of the United States left 2 billion 
      dollars worth of damage in its wake.</P>
      <P>The cost of disasters in the 1990s was some nine times higher than in 
      the 1960s, and it is becoming increasingly clear that term "natural" for 
      such events is a misnomer.</P>
      <P>No doubt there will always be genuinely natural hazards -- whether 
      floods, droughts, storms or earthquakes. But today's disasters are 
      sometimes man-made, and nearly always exacerbated by human action -- or 
      inaction.</P>
      <P>Obviously disasters like Mitch can exacerbate poverty. But poverty can 
      also exacerbate disasters.</P>
      <P>It is no accident that 90 per cent of disaster victims worldwide are in 
      developing countries. Poverty and population pressures are forcing growing 
      numbers of poor people to live in harm's way -- on flood plains, 
      earthquake-</P>
      <P>prone zones and unstable hillsides. Their extraordinary vulnerability 
      is perhaps the single most important cause of disaster casualties.</P>
      <P>And as cities in developing countries grow ever larger, as urban 
      communication, energy and transportation systems grow ever more dense and 
      complex, the risk of high cost losses is ever greater.</P>
      <P>Disasters can also be made worse by faulty development practices. 
      Massive logging operations reduce the soil’s ability to absorb heavy 
      rainfall. That in turn makes erosion and flooding more likely. The 
      destruction of wetlands reduces the land's capacity to absorb heavy 
      run-off.</P>
      <P>Extreme climatic events may also be caused in part by global warming, 
      which is in turn partly caused by increased carbon emissions from burning 
      fossil fuels. Can it really be a coincidence that 1998 was the warmest 
      year recorded since worldwide measurements were first taken some 150 years 
      ago?</P>
      <P>Much remains to be achieved. The programmes initiated during the decade 
      point the way.</P>
      <P>We must, above all, shift from a culture of reaction to a culture of 
      prevention. The humanitarian community does a remarkable job in responding 
      to disasters. But the most important task in the medium and long term is 
      to strengthen and broaden programmes which reduce the number and cost of 
      disasters in the first place.</P>
      <P>Prevention is not only more humane than cure; it is also much cheaper. 
      Disaster reduction and disaster relief are complementary, and yet quite 
      different. Each is vital. Neither should be subsumed by the other.</P>
      <P>Achieving prevention, as the IDNDR team and their partners have 
      tirelessly argued, requires better early warning of impending disasters to 
      give vulnerable populations time to move out of harm's way. It means 
      better policies to mitigate the effects of natural disasters. But above 
      all, it means greater efforts to reduce vulnerability in the first place. 
      Unfortunately, such efforts rarely receive much publicity and thus too 
      often fail to engage the attention of top policy makers.</P>
      <P>Early warning is critical. But it will achieve little unless we use it 
      for a combined effort by all sectors to plan ahead and build up people's 
      capacity to respond rapidly at the local level.</P>
      <P>And if we are to make real progress, we need a better understanding of 
      the scientific and technical requirements of prevention. And we need to 
      apply them resolutely in all our policies on development, housing and land 
      use.</P>
      <P>The scientific community understands the importance of the connection 
      between natural disasters, climate change, and land use. The challenge now 
      is to communicate this understanding more effectively to citizens and 
      policy makers.</P>
      <P>Prevention policy is too important to be left to governments and 
      international agencies alone. To succeed it must also engage civil 
      society, the private sector and the media.</P>
      <P>We know what has to be done. What is now required is the political 
      commitment to do it.</P>
      <P>Of course the United Nations is not alone in the disaster prevention 
      field. But it has a special leadership role thanks to its universal 
      character, its broad policy agenda, its capacity for acting as an honest 
      broker and its vital role as a forum for global dialogue.</P>
      <P>Real progress will require Member States, NGOs and international 
      organizations to work together on advocacy, networking and consensus 
      building, creating the sorts of global coalition that we saw in the 
      campaigns to ban landmines and establish the International Criminal 
      Court.</P>
      <P>Among our most pressing tasks is to create clear guidelines for future 
      action at all levels.</P>
      <P>Above all, let us not forget that disaster prevention is a moral 
      imperative, no less important than reducing the risks of war.</P>
      <P>I applaud your extraordinary work over the past decade, and I share 
      your determination to work even harder in the years ahead. Thank you 
      all."</P>
