            <P class=paragraphtext>The township of Alexandra (Alex) was 
            established in 1912 and is close to the center of Johannesburg. It 
            covers an area of over 800 ha (including east bank) and its 
            infrastructure was designed for a population of about 70,000. 
            Current population estimates vary widely and have been put at 
            figures ranging from 180,000 to 750,000. Its original stands of size 
            of 500-600 sq.m are characterized by sizeable houses of reasonable 
            stock but usually with 3 &#8211; 6 additional separate rooms built in the 
            original gardens, each usually housing an additional family who rent 
            from the main householder. The additional rental units, which 
            provide a significant income to the main householder, are termed 
            &#8220;backyard shacks&#8221; although many are of brick or block construction 
            of reasonable quality. There are an estimated 20,000 shacks of which 
            approximately 7,000 are located in &#8220;backyards&#8221;. <BR>&nbsp;</P></TD>

      <P class=paragraphtext>The significant, unplanned population has 
      overloaded the infrastructure such that water pressures are low and sewers 
      frequently block and overflow. Maintenance of such systems is very 
      difficult because the high densities and congested nature of the backyard 
      shack development makes access for maintenance very difficult or 
      impossible in places.</P>
      <P class=paragraphtext>In addition to backyard shack development, since 
      the repealing of the apartheid laws, which restricted movement for the 
      black population, there has been considerable population increase in 
      Alexandra from within South Africa and from neighboring countries seeking 
      employment opportunities. This has resulted in not only overcrowding in 
      hostels but also in informal settlements developed on the Jukskei river 
      banks and its three tributaries which pass through Alex. There are an 
      estimated 7,500 households living in these areas at very high densities 
      with poor services, in very poor environmental conditions, and in danger 
      from flooding.</P>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Alex falls within the jurisdiction of the Eastern 
      Metropolitan Local Council (EMLC) although this will change with formation 
      of the proposed new unitary authority. Services are currently the 
      responsibility of various sections of the Greater Johannesburg 
      Metropolitan Council (GMJC) Technical Services Department but separate 
      utility organizations are to be established during the reorganization.</P>
      <P class=paragraphtext><A name=Anchor-Problems-21683></A><B>Problems and 
      Recommendations<BR>&#8226; Rehabilitation of Infrastructure: Sewerage</B></P>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Problems:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Overloaded System:<BR>Due to the fact that the 
        originally developed area of Alex has now a population probably in 
        excess of 4 times the number for which it was designed the waterborne 
        sewerage system has become overloaded and thus frequently blocks and 
        surcharges.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Poor Access for Maintenance: <BR>The formal 
        residential stands and houses that were built on them were designed for 
        single family living. Backyard shacks now cover the area of most such 
        stands. Structures have been built over sewer lines and manholes that 
        has made access for maintenance impossible in most cases without 
        requiring some demolition of structures.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Poor Sanitation Facilities for Informal 
        Clusters: <BR>The informal areas built on the riverbanks and tributaries 
        are not connected to the formal waterborne sewerage system and are 
        served by banks of chemical toilets. These are not only unpleasant to 
        use but are costly for the EMLC to service. In addition because the 
        banks of toilets are placed on the periphery of the informal clusters, 
        because of space constraints within the areas and because of the threat 
        of crime, dwellers do not venture out in the night to use the 
        facilities. Hence overnight containerization of wastewater is required 
        which is disposed of next day. </LI></UL>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>New Interceptor Sewers: <BR>As a first step to 
        overcome the general overloading of the sewerage system a concept 
        currently being considered, and investigated by consultants engaged by 
        the &#8220;sewerage section&#8221; of the Technical Services Department of GMJC, is 
        to divide Alex into three sewerage zones and to construct new 
        interceptor sewers for each zone which will connect to a new outfall 
        sewer carrying sewage off of the site to the bulk sewerage system. The 
        interceptor sewers would be designed such that they could in total take 
        up to approximately 750,000 (to be confirmed by consultants studies). 
        This possible &#8220;over-sizing&#8221; will be to ensure adequate capacity (the 
        marginal cost of reasonable over-sizing of a pipeline is small compared 
        with future possible future abandonment and relaying). This would seem 
        to be a pragmatic way forward in sewer rehabilitation planning for Alex. 
        although efforts should be made to determine the existing population 
        more accurately. Reasonably up to date aerial photography is available 
        as a basis for this. In addition to consideration of the new interceptor 
        sewers (secondary system) consideration will also need to be given to 
        the tertiary system (connections from stands and groups of stands) which 
        must be equally overloaded.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Improve Backyard Shack Sewerage Arrangements: 
        <BR>If sewer blockages are to be minimized in the future, and if sewers 
        are to be maintained, there would appear to be little alternative to 
        improving both backyard shack configurations and sewer 
        alignments.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Alternatives to Chemical Toilets: <BR>The EMLC 
        is currently constructing some new ablution blocks in Alex. and there 
        would appear to be a need for further toilet blocks or other sanitation 
        options to replace the existing separate banks of chemical toilets which 
        give a poor level of service at a high management cost.<BR>&nbsp;

      <P class=paragraphtext>Problems:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Low Water Pressure: <BR>Because of the high 
        population there is a demand for water which exceeds system design 
        capacity. This results in low pressures at peak times.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Dangerous Electrical Connections: <BR>There 
        appear to be many illegal connections to the electricity supply system. 
        Sub-stations are insecure and present a considerable danger to children 
        with easy access available (e.g. doors to metal ground level units open) 
        where it appears that &#8220;hotwiring&#8221; has occurred. </LI></UL>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Improvements to Water Supply Main: 
        <BR>Consideration is being given by GMJC to the laying of a new supply 
        line into Alex to increase quantity and pressure and it is understood 
        that consultants are to be appointed to plan and design a rehabilitation 
        program. It would be important to ensure that those planning and 
        designing sewerage system rehabilitation liase closely with those 
        designing the water supply system rehabilitation. Ideally planning and 
        design would be more efficient and easier to co-ordinate if carried out 
        by the same team. To reduce the possibility of future illegal tapings of 
        any new pressure mains, consideration should be given to laying them at 
        greater depths and/or other means of protection (e.g. covering top of 
        pipes with concrete slabs before backfilling).<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Install More Secure Transformer/Sub-stations: 
        <BR>Consideration should be given to the provision of more secure, 
        heavy-duty sub-stations. The feasibility of providing some form of 
        pole-mounted transformers is an option that could be considered.

      <P class=paragraphtext>Problem</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Compartmentalized Responsibility: <BR>Service 
        planning and delivery (e.g. water, sewer, roads and storm drainage, 
        electricity) rests with a number of different departments and thus 
        delivery can lead to inefficiencies unless there is substantial 
        co-ordination at all stages of the project planning, budgeting and 
        implementation cycle. </LI></UL>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Improve Co-ordination Arrangements: <BR>In 
        planning and implementing infrastructure upgrading works covering a 
        number of sub-sectors in heavily populated dense areas international 
        experience has shown that; a) planning and carrying out the works 
        together better ensures compatibility of proposals; b) enables works to 
        be carried out more quickly; c) avoids continued disruption to the 
        beneficiary communities due to service improvements being carried out at 
        different times, and; d) is less costly. Service delivery is now through 
        different Council departments and in future will be through a mix of 
        councils departments and utility organizations, depending on the 
        service. The compartmentalized responsibilities require that much 
        attention is given to the co-ordination of service rehabilitation 
        planning and implementation activities. To better ensure adequate 
        co-ordination, consideration should be given to the proposed new 
        &#8220;Strategic Planning Unit&#8221; of the GMJC, or perhaps a similar unit at each 
        of the new regional manager levels, being responsible for co-ordinating 
        integrated infrastructure/service improvements. It should have the power 
        of bringing local government departments and the utility organizations 
        together in the planning and implementation of schemes. This would 
        apply, not only for individual projects, but also for general 
        programming to ensure project budget is available.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Involve Communities: <BR>Recognizing the 
        importance of the communities and involving them at key stages of 
        project planning and implementation of upgrading initiatives further 
        reduces the possibility of continued disruption in communities during an 
        upgrading project. The use of contractors formed out of the community 
        will assist in the co-ordination as well as providing employment 
        opportunities. </LI></UL>

      <P class=paragraphtext>Problems</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Extremely high density, poor access and 
        services: <BR>Over the past nine years thousands of shacks have been 
        built over and adjacent to the three tributaries. These areas are 
        extremely dense with only tortuous, narrow access, few communal water 
        points and banks of chemical toilets on the peripheries of the 
        settlements. Some have electricity supply which appears to have been 
        connected illegally. One-room dwellings almost completely cover the 
        tributary areas. Narrow (less than 1 m wide footpaths that wind 
        haphazardly through the shacks provide the only access and water 
        drain-off. Occasional storm drainage grates and standpipes provide the 
        only services. Densities likely exceed 1000 persons per hectare in these 
        settlements.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Tributaries Blocked and Polluted: <BR>The 
        tributaries (natural streams) have, in places, been piped and a number 
        of concrete aprons and gullies have been constructed over them to which 
        the communal water points drain. The gullies are choked with garbage and 
        the tributaries appear to be substantially blocked. Maintenance is 
        difficult and capacity constrained by the built-upon drains. </LI></UL>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Minimize Relocation: <BR>Relocation is needed, 
        but should be based only on the need to improve access to shacks as well 
        as to the tributaries for maintenance and to be able to provide basic 
        service improvements NOT the wholesale clearance of the areas.<BR>&nbsp; 

        <LI class=paragraphtext>Maximize Re-blocking and in-situ Development: 
        <BR>With innovative planning and re-blocking (e.g. realignment of 
        property boundaries into small narrow stands configured for row-housing 
        and/or selective adoption of two story walk up apartment units), use may 
        be made of much of the areas on each side of the tributaries (see 
        illustrative diagram attached).<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Improve Temporary Sanitation Solutions: <BR>To 
        eliminate the chemical toilets various other arrangements to improve 
        sanitation for the areas (e.g. communal toilets connected to the sewers) 
        should be considered.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Divert Some Storm-water Flow Along Streets: 
        <BR>To reduce flows in the tributaries at storm times, which will reduce 
        flooding risks, the possibility of modifying storm-water drainage 
        arrangements, such as diverting some flows along streets, or into 
        underground storm drains along the streets with appropriate out-falls at 
        the river, should be considered.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Convert Tributaries to Combined Sewers: 
        <BR>Given that parts of the tributaries are already piped and that grey 
        water (and household refuse) is already being discharged to them which 
        leads to blockages and pollution of the river consideration should be 
        given to converting the sewers to &#8220;combined sewers&#8221;, connecting them to 
        the sewerage system. The sewers would be designed such that only storm 
        overflows would discharge to the river. With improved access better 
        arrangements for refuse containerization and collection would be 
        possible. </LI></UL>

        of those shacks (+-3000 families) constructed along the banks of the 
        Juskei river are in danger in times of flood (e.g. early 2000). 
        Relocation of all those below appropriate flood lines (formerly for a 
        50-year return storm but recently increased by Government to a 100-year 
        return storm) would appear to be unavoidable.<BR>&nbsp;

        shacks which have been developed on the formal housing plots have been 
        developed without compliance with planning and building code norms and 
        have made servicing and maintenance very difficult.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Backyard Shacks Place Strain Utilities and 
        Infrastructure: <BR>Because infrastructure and utilities were designed 
        for single family per plot living (say 6 persons) and now up to six 
        families (20 persons) can occupy each plot inevitable strains are placed 
        on infrastructure and services causing capacity and blockage problems.

      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Program for Legalization: <BR>It would not be 
        prudent, efficient or acceptable to attempt to remove the backyard 
        shacks. It would seem sensible if they were formally legalized. This 
        would demonstrate to landlords and tenants that government would not be 
        attempting to remove them in the future thus encouraging families to 
        invest more in the structures.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Program for Backyard Improvements: <BR>Once 
        shacks were legalized programs could be developed with landlords to 
        improve backyard conditions. Re-blocking of shack schemes to achieve 
        more efficient and healthy layouts, which would aim to permit access to 
        services for maintenance, and micro-credit schemes are possible elements 
        of such programs. </LI></UL>

      <P class=paragraphtext>Problems</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Current Standards and Service Levels Are Costly 
        and Waste Land: <BR>Requirements for high levels of infrastructure 
        service (e.g. individual water connection, waterborne sewerage, paved 
        roads etc.) bear no relation to the affordability of the beneficiaries 
        (both in capital and running cost terms) and are thus very costly for 
        government as little or no capital contributions are made (subsidy 
        schemes) and payment of bills for user charges is poor. In addition, the 
        requirements for minimum plot size (250 sq.m), and hence low densities, 
        which do not relate to people&#8217;s ability to pay and for the provision of 
        full service, both factors influencing payment of housing subsidies by 
        government have distorted planning and development of housing schemes. 
        Such schemes are thus not only costly but also very wasteful on the use 
        of scarce urban land.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Low Densities (large stands encourage unplanned 
        backyard shacks): <BR>An argument may be made that large plots and thus 
        low densities actually invite the fortunate beneficiary to invest in 
        construction of unplanned backyard shacks to provide rental income. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P class=paragraphtext>Recommendations</P>
      <UL>
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Special Development Zones: <BR>The relaxation of 
        long-established planning and engineering standards by responsible 
        authorities is difficult to achieve in the short terms and may not be 
        feasible. Consideration should thus be given to creating &#8220;Special 
        Development Zones&#8221; which permit relaxed standards in the interest of 
        trying and testing new standards and modes of development, promote more 
        efficient land use, provide only services that people need (functional 
        standards), and thus reduce costs. Arrangements to monitor and evaluate 
        the workings of such zones would be established as part of the 
        requirements for their establishment.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Small Scale: <BR>In trying alternative 
        approaches it would be prudent to test these on a small scale to begin 
        with and to monitor and evaluate their success before embarking on their 
        settlement wide use.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>High Densities. <BR>Provided developments are 
        carefully planned, high densities need not be a problem causing 
        environmental, health and access to services (for maintenance) problems. 
        Problems and waste occur when land and services are provided which 
        people do not really need for themselves and cannot pay for.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Planning for Backyard Rental Units. <BR>Rental 
        income is socially desirable and should be encouraged. However, the 
        issue is whether this is done in a planned or an unplanned manner in new 
        schemes and in relocation areas. It is possible to design backyard 
        rental units into new schemes from the beginning. This would result in 
        higher planned densities in these schemes with infrastructure designed 
        accordingly. In addition to providing income for plot owners, it would 
        result in better use of scarce urban land, and would, importantly, cater 
        to the currently suppressed demand for rental accommodation.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Designing Schemes with Choices for 
        beneficiaries. <BR>Low-income beneficiary families are of different 
        sizes, have different incomes and have different needs. Offering choices 
        ranging from very small to larger plots, and with or without planned 
        backyard units would seem to be desirable. The prices charged should be 
        based on the value of the unit. Subsidies should be proportional to 
        income with the most needy families and larger families being eligible 
        for greater subsidies. Subsidies could also be designed to encourage 
        savings by matching some already established savings plan.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI class=paragraphtext>Land on Far East Bank: <BR>The presently 
        &#8220;sterilized&#8221; strip of land which is the alignment for the proposed K-206 
        road (and which many would argue is not required given existing and 
        other possible major road improvements in the area) would be ideal for 
        relocation of displaced families from Alex. This could be developed at 
        higher densities than the current norms and at appropriate functional 
        standards and thus house all families needing to be relocated from Alex 
        plus others. </LI></UL>

      <P class=paragraphtext>Alexandra in many ways is a prototype for 
      strategies, approaches and actions that could be applied in other parts of 
      Greater Metropolitan Johannesburg. Some include:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P class=paragraphtext>The use of &#8220;<B>special development zones</B>&#8221; 
        (SDZs) designated as areas in which to introduce alternative, more 
        appropriate planning, design and regulatory norms. These zones would 
        allow for testing and demonstrating effective and least-cost ways of 
        adopting to the needs and preferences of residents, increasing the 
        efficiency of land use, and for producing innovative and lower cost 
        housing types/options. SDZs can serve to compare and monitor alternative 
        development and maintenance costs and should lead to better informed 
        decisions on city-wide land use, zoning, and development guidelines. 
        Therefore demonstration plans in SDZs should be accompanied by a 
        monitoring and evaluation system that would produce recommendations for 
        updating policies and standards.</P>
        <P class=paragraphtext><B>Introduce cost related to affordability in 
        selection of standards</B>. Given the huge demand for new low cost 
        housing, relocation plans, and the scale of in situ upgrading needed in 
        the GJMA plus the need to plan for the eventual elimination of large 
        subsidies, cost reduction in all new actions are called for. These 
        financial and land constraints are best addressed by testing and 
        adopting new performance-based functional standards on a city-wide basis 
        that maximize land use and minimize infrastructure investment and 
        maintenance.</P>
        <P class=paragraphtext><B>Introduce more choice in new schemes on vacant 
        land and in relocation sites.</B> Recognize that family circumstances, 
        and family needs vary. Some families are small, some are larger. Cost 
        savings might be achieved by offering more choice to beneficiaries, and 
        by charging families in proportion to the value of plot received.</P>
        <P class=paragraphtext><B>Introduce planned backyard rental units</B>. 
        Backyard rental units seem to be culturally accepted as a means of 
        obtaining extra income. By planning for such schemes for families that 
        may choose this option, densities will be increased and infrastructure 
        can be properly planned. Also the currently unmet demand for rental 
        units can be addressed.</P>
        <P class=paragraphtext><B>Integrated approach to service planning and 
        delivery</B>, should be standard practice in in-situ upgrading areas, 
        re-blocking, relocation, and new land release/development programs. By 
        integrating and synchronizing the design and implementation of the 
        various service networks, efficiencies, and minimized implementation 
        disruption can be achieved.</P>
        <P class=paragraphtext><B>Development of relocation strategies, 
        guidelines and plans</B>. Having city-wide strategies and guidelines for 
        handling relocation needs can help plan and carry out site specific 
        actions when needed. It can also help estimate and plan for the 
        resources needed over time. Principles for relocation could be defined 
        and made public. These might include policies about minimizing 
        relocation, community cost recovery principles, land tenure policies, 
        priorities for near-by relocation, etc., and could be specified in a 
        general policy paper with related guidelines for application (see, for 
        example, the World Bank guidelines for voluntary relocation in 
        projects). An accompanying strategy paper could help outline short-and 
        medium-term estimates of households that will need to be accommodated in 
        specific areas of the city and the land requirements for doing so in 
        differing sectors of the city. This would help set priorities for land 
        use, land acquisition needs, and help estimate the cost/subsidies 
        needed. It would also help define a timeline for implementation in 
        synchronization with the various housing actions over time. The plan 
        should also introduce a &#8220;menu&#8221; of options for relocation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
