and Objectives</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, were adversely 
affected by excessive rains during the 1999/2000 season.&nbsp; During the same 
season Mauritius and some provinces in Mozambique received inadequate 
rains.&nbsp; This study was therefore conducted to assess the seed requirements 
for each of these affected SADC countries, as well as to make inventories of 
possible sources of appropriate seed within the sub-region. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><A name=Findings></A><B><FONT color=#000066><FONT 
size=+2>Findings</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>In Mozambique, the provinces affected by the floods were Maputo, Inhambane, 
Sofala, Gaza, Manica, Tete and Cabo Delgado.&nbsp; About 154 927 families were 
affected by the floods and 176 760 hectares of crops were lost.&nbsp; Parts of 
Cabo Delgado and Manica were affected by drought during the same season.&nbsp; 
The cropped area lost by the 31 117 families affected by drought amounted to 33 
908 hectares. 
<P>As part of the emergency recovery in Mozambique, farmers received seeds for 
planting in the second cropping season (March/April to June), as well as 
handtools.&nbsp; A total of 213 099 kits containing maize, cowpea, bean, pumpkin 
and vegetable seed were approved for distribution, at a cost of US$4 980 918 
(excluding transportation).&nbsp; All the seed that was distributed for planting 
during the second season was secured from SEMOC and Seed Company International. 
<P>It is recommended that families that have been classified by Instituto 
Nacional de Gestao de Calamidades as moderately affected, and strongly affected 
by floods and drought, be provided with seed kits during the main growing season 
(October/November onwards). These families will require about 1 414 tonnes of 
maize seed, 285 tonnes of beans, 285 tonnes of cowpeas and 10 tonnes each of 
tomatoes, onion and cabbage at a cost of US$11 427 200.00. 
<P>If every household affected by floods and drought is provided with 15kg of 
maize seed, then the maize that SEMOC (Mozambique&#8217;s only seed company) expects 
to harvest in 2000,&nbsp; will not be adequate. (SEMOC expects to have 1 700 
tonnes of maize seed).&nbsp; Seed will therefore have to be imported from Seed 
Company International (who have shares in SEMOC) to meet the shortfall.&nbsp; 
Seed Company plans to harvest 2 000 tonnes of Matuba maize seed and 1 100 tonnes 
of cowpea.&nbsp; Seed of beans, tomatoes, onion and cabbage could be sourced 
from South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
<P>In Botswana excessive rains destroyed crops that were meant for seed 
production (27 out of 47 seed growers that are contracted by the Seed 
Multiplication Unit were affected).&nbsp; The families affected by floods in 
Botswana will require 1 000 tonnes of sorghum seed, 500 tonnes of maize seed, 25 
tonnes of pearl millet seed, 50 tonnes of cowpea or mungbean seed, 20 tonnes of 
groundnut seed and 10 tonnes of sunflower seed. Seed production in Botswana is 
the sole responsibility of the government of Botswana and there are no private 
seed production companies.&nbsp; Currently the seed stocks held by the Seed 
Multiplication&nbsp; Unit fall far short of Botswana&#8217;s seed requirements.&nbsp; 
Seed will therefore have to be imported from South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe 
at a cost of approximately US$1 650 000.00. 
<P>About 13 000 households were affected by floods in Zambia, and the crop area 
lost due to floods was 1 515 hectares.&nbsp; Farmers will require maize, rice, 
sorghum, pearl millet and groundnut seed as well as banana suckers. Seed stocks 
that are available in Zambia are adequate to meet the needs of farmers affected 
by the floods.&nbsp; Seed could therefore be procured from seed companies and 
rural seed projects within Zambia, and this is expected to cost about US$246 
000.00. 
<P>Mauritius was affected by drought and about 50% of the sugarcane crop and 35% 
of vegetable crops were affected.&nbsp; The seed reserves in Mauritius are 
adequate to meet the seed needs of affected farmers.&nbsp; However, it will be 
necessary to scale seed production efforts up during the next season, in order 
to restock the national seed reserve.&nbsp; The amount of money required to fund 
this effort is US$200 000-00. 
<P>In Zimbabwe the provinces affected by the floods were Manicaland, Masvingo, 
Midlands and Matabeleland South. Approximately 30 000 hectares of cropped areas 
were lost.&nbsp; It is recommended that seed packs containing maize/sorghum, 
groundnuts , cowpeas, and vegetable seed are provided to farmers.&nbsp; The 
amount of seed required by affected farmers is approximately 300 tonnes of 
maize, 150 tonnes of sorghum or millets, 150 tonnes of groundnuts, 150 tonnes of 
cowpeas and 3 tonnes each of rape, tomato and onion.&nbsp; Seed provision in 
Zimbabwe is expected to cost US$952 500.00. The seed that is required for 
farmers affected by floods in Zimbabwe is available within Zimbabwe from 
different seed companies. <BR>&nbsp;

recommendations</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>In view of the seriousness of the situation in the SADC countries affected by 
floods and drought, it is recommended that assistance is provided by 
distributing seeds to affected families.&nbsp; However, cognisant of the fact 
that local trading plays a vital role in servicing the communities and has also 
suffered due to the calamities it is advisable to involve the trader in the seed 
distribution scheme. 
<P>Varieties that have not been tested in the region should not be introduced 
into the affected countries as a consequence of the disaster.&nbsp; From the 
information sofar gathered this seems to be accepted policy by all 
concerned.&nbsp; Furthermore, SADC member states should be supported to enable 
them to set up national strategic seed reserves.&nbsp; In addition to the 
establishment of a seed network that can expeditiously respond to disaster 
situations.&nbsp; Such a network would be able to provide data on regional seed 
availability on a continuos basis. <BR>Last but not least local germplasm might 
have been lost. An assessment whether this is the case and if so the possibility 
to reintroduce lost germplasm from genebanks or other sources should be 
considered.
