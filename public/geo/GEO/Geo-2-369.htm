      <P align=center><B>International Joint Commission cautions that efforts 
      must remain focused on protecting against flood damages </B>
      <P>In its final report on Red River flooding, released today, the 
      International Joint Commission (IJC) cautions that, although the 1997 
      flood was a rare event, floods of the same magnitude, or even greater, can 
      be expected to occur in the future. Economic damages in the United States 
      and Canada from the 1997 flood approached $5 billion (U.S. dollars) and 
      flood recovery and mitigation costs continue to grow. 
      <P>While a significant number of flood mitigation actions have been 
      initiated since 1997, the people and property of the Red River basin will 
      remain at undue risk until comprehensive, integrated, binational solutions 
      are developed and implemented. Solutions for one part of the basin must 
      take into account the impacts on other parts of the basin. 
      <P>Flood protection for major population centers in the Red River basin 
      needs immediate attention. The risk of failure of Winnipeg's existing 
      flood protection infrastructure is high under flow conditions similar to 
      or greater than those experienced in 1997. Detailed assessment of the 
      significant flood risks facing Fargo-Moorhead should be expedited so that 
      appropriate mitigation measures can be identified and quickly implemented. 
      Flood protection works currently being undertaken in Grand Forks-East 
      Grand Forks also need to be completed in a timely manner. 
      <P>The needs of small communities, individual isolated farmsteads and 
      agriculture must not be overlooked. The flood plain ecosystem of the Red 
      River basin must also be protected as part of the process of developing 
      flood damage reduction solutions. 
      <P>The IJC finds that there is no single solution to the challenge of 
      protecting the people and property of the Red River basin against flood 
      damages. All possible approaches, including both structural and 
      nonstructural damage reduction measures, must be considered as part of a 
      comprehensive plan. The IJC recommendations provide a blueprint for action 
      for governments at all levels. The challenge will come in the execution of 
      these recommendations to ensure that basin residents are resilient to 
      flooding. 
      <P>The IJC is a binational Canada-United States organization established 
      by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. It assists the U.S. and Canadian 
      governments in managing waters they share, including examining and 
      reporting on issues when asked to do so by the two federal governments. <A

      the Red</I></A> responds to a request of June 12, 1997 asking the IJC to 
      make recommendations on the means to reduce, mitigate and prevent harm 
      from future flooding in the Red River basin.
