      <P>In 1984 a deadly cloud of methyl isocyanate killed thousands of people 
      in Bhopal, India. Shortly thereafter there was a serious chemical release 
      at a sister plant in West Virginia. These incidents underscored demands by 
      industrial workers and communities in several states for information on 
      hazardous materials. Public interest and environmental organizations 
      around the country accelerated demands for information on toxic chemicals 
      being released "beyond the fence line" -- outside of the facility. Against 
      this background, the <A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/tri/ttitle3.htm">Emergency Planning and Community 
      Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)</A> was enacted.</P>
      <H3>The Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) of 
      1986</H3>
      <P>Hailed as one of the most potent pieces of environmental legislation in 
      20 years, EPCRA's primary purpose is to inform communities and citizens of 
      chemical hazards in their areas. Sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA require 
      businesses to report the locations and quantities of chemicals stored 
      on-site to state and local governments. This helps communities prepare to 
      respond to chemical spills and similar emergencies. The goal is to reduce 
      risk for communities as a whole. </P>
      <P>Through EPCRA, Congress mandated that a Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) 
      be made public. TRI provides citizens with accurate information about 
      potentially hazardous chemicals and their use so that communities have 
      more power to hold companies accountable and make informed decisions about 
      how toxic chemicals are to be managed. </P>
      <P>Section 313 of EPCRA specifically requires manufacturers to report 
      releases of more than 600 designated toxic chemicals to the environment. 
      The reports are submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
      (EPA) and state governments. EPA compiles this data in an on-line, 
      publicly accessible national computerized Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). 
      This vast new source of data is indeed a powerful force for environmental 
      improvement.</P>TRI facilities are required to report on releases of toxic 
      chemicals into the air, water, and land. In addition, they need to report 
      on off-site transfers -- a transfer of wastes for treatment or disposal at 
      a separate facility. Facilities are also required to report on pollution 
      prevention activities and chemical recycling. Reports must be submitted on 
      or before July 1 each year and must cover activities that occurred at the 
      facility during the previous year.

      <H3>Who Must Report to TRI?</H3>
      <P>Manufacturing facilities and facilities added in 1998 that have the 
      equivalent of 10 or more full-time employees and meet the established 
      thresholds for manufacture, processing, or "otherwise use" of listed 
      chemicals must report their releases and other waste management quantities 
      (including quantities transferred off-site for further waste management). 
      Manufacturing facilities are defined as facilities in <A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/tri/siccode.htm">Standard Industrial 
      Classification (SIC) codes 20-39</A>, which include, among others: 
      chemicals, petroleum refining, primary metals, fabricated metals, paper, 
      plastics, and transportation equipment. Federal facilities have been 
      required to report since 1994, regardless of their SIC classification. 
</P>
      <P>In May 1997, EPA added <A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/tri/siccode.htm#newind">seven new industry 
      sectors</A> that began reporting to the TRI for the first time in July 
      1999 for reporting year 1998. These include metal mines, coal mines, 
      electrical utilities that combust coal or oil, commercial hazardous waste 
      treatment facilities, chemical wholesalers, petroleum bulk terminals and 
      plants, and solvent recovery services.</P>

      <H3>TRI INFORMATION </H3>
      <H3>The TRI database includes information on...</H3>
      <UL>
        <LI>What chemicals were released into the local environment during the 
        preceding year.<BR>
        <LI>How much of each chemical went into the air, water, and land in a 
        particular year.<BR>
        <LI>How much of the chemicals were transported away from the reporting 
        facility for disposal, treatment, recycling, or energy recovery.<BR>
        <LI>How chemical wastes were treated at the reporting facility.<BR>
        <LI>The efficiency of waste treatment.<BR>
        <LI>Pollution prevention and chemical recycling 
      activities.<BR></LI></UL>TRI provides the first comprehensive overview of 
      toxic chemical pollution from manufacturing facilities in the United 
      States. However, the law does not cover toxic chemicals that reach the 
      environment from non-industrial sources, such as dry cleaners or auto 
      service stations. Reported releases are annual estimates. The amounts 
      reported could have been released evenly over the course of the year or, 
      possibly, in a single large burst. Though the TRI data base is a starting 
      point for assessing possible health effects resulting from industrial 
      chemical use, the user cannot ascertain levels of exposure or risk without 
      combining TRI information with information from other sources. Even though 
      the TRI reporting base has its limitations, it provides communities with a 
      spring board from which citizens can seek further vital information about 
      toxic chemicals in their area.

      <P>
      <H3>A Public "Report Card" </H3>TRI is a public "report card" for the 
      industrial community, creating a powerful motivation for waste reduction. 
      This annual accounting of the nation's management of industrial toxic 
      chemical wastes is a valuable source of information for concerned 
      individuals and communities. Citizens can use TRI to evaluate local 
      facilities through comparisons...determine how toxic chemicals are 
      used...and, with other information, evaluate potential health risks for 
      their community. Organizations can use TRI information as a starting point 
      for constructive dialogue with manufacturing businesses in the area.

      <H3>POLLUTION PREVENTION AND TRI</H3>Following implementation of the 
      Pollution Prevention (PPA) of 1990, TRI reporting has become even more 
      comprehensive. Historically, government agencies and waste generators have 
      tried to resolve environmental problems using "end-of-pipe" waste 
      management practices, that is, treating or disposing of waste after it has 
      been created. Pollution prevention strategies focus instead on avoiding 
      creation of wastes by redesigning products, changing processes, 
      substituting raw materials for less toxic substances and other techniques.
      <P>With passage of the PPA, Congress adopted as national policy an 
      environmental hierarchy that establishes pollution prevention as the first 
      choice among waste management practices. For waste that cannot be avoided 
      at the source, recycling is considered the next best option. A waste 
      generator should turn to treatment or disposal only after source reduction 
      and recycling have been considered.
      <P>Reporting requirements for TRI changed in 1991 as a result of the PPA. 
      Prior to 1991, facilities were required to report toxic substances 
      released into the environment and transferred offsite for treatmentor 
      disposal. Beginning in 1991, facilities were also required to indicate 
      amounts of chemicals that are recycled, used for energy recovery, and 
      treated on-site. (Energy recovery means burning the chemical so that 
      resulting heat energy contributes to subsequent manufacturing operations.) 
      These amounts must be reported for the past year and the current year, as 
      well as projected amounts for the next two years. Furthermore, facilities 
      must indicate source reduction activities that have been implemented.
      <P>These changes to TRI will highlight the importance of pollution 
      prevention and encourage reporting facilities to develop and implement 
      strategies for reducing waste. This new information will also help the 
      public gauge industry's commitment to improving the nation's environment. 
      By working together, businesses and neighboring communities can build on 
      emerging pollution prevention practices for everyone's benefit.
