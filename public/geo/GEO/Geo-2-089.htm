Update</FONT>
<HR SIZE=7>
</CENTER></H2>Wetlands protection - especially the Federal regulatory program 
under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act - has been controversial over the past 
few years. Much continues to be said about the Federal regulation of wetlands, 
but what is really happening? 
<P>Shortly after coming into office, the Clinton Administration convened an 
interagency working group to address legitimate concerns with Federal wetland 
policy. 
<P>After hearing from States, developers, farmers, environmental interests, 
members of Congress, and scientists, the working group developed a 
comprehensive, 40-point plan to enhance wetland protection while making wetland 
regulation more fair, flexible, and effective. This plan was issued on August 
24, 1993. 
<P>The Clinton Administration’s Plan emphasizes improving Federal wetlands 
policy by<BR>streamlining wetlands permitting programs<BR>increasing cooperation 
with private landowners to protect and restore wetlands<BR>basing wetland 
protection on good science and sound judgment<BR>increasing participation by 
States, Tribes, local governments, and the public in wetlands protection. 
<P>
<H4>Accomplishments</H4>The Clinton Administration has already taken a number of 
actions to implement the Wetlands Plan including - 
<UL>
  <LI>clarified, through regulation, that prior converted croplands are not 
  wetlands under both the Swampbuster and Clean Water Act programs 
  <LI>issued policies that have increased flexibility in wetland permitting and 
  reduced burdens on permit applicants 
  <LI>given USDA the responsibility for identifying all wetlands on agricultural 
  lands for both the Swampbuster and Clean Water Act programs 
  <LI>made it easier for permit applicants to use Amitigation banks@ 
  <LI>allowed for greater flexibility in permitting requirements in Alaska, due 
  to the unique circumstances in that State 
  <LI>authorized New Jersey to operate its own wetlands program, in place of the 
  Clean Water Act Section 404 program 
  <LI>requested increased funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program, to assist 
  farmers who want to restore wetlands 
  <LI>increased fund to States, Tribes, and local governments for wetlands 
  programs </LI></UL>
<H4>Next Steps</H4>These efforts are only the first steps that the Clinton 
Administration is taking to reduce the burden of Federal wetlands regulations, 
to minimize Federal overlap, and to encourage greater participation by State, 
Tribal and local governments in protecting wetlands. Activities currently under 
development include - 
<UL>
  <LI>developing an administrative process to minimize the regulatory burden on 
  small landowners and farmers for small projects on their land 
  <LI>establishing clear and firm deadlines for Corps of Engineers permit 
  decisions 
  <LI>allowing administrative appeals of permit denials and wetland 
  jurisdictional determinations as an alternative to expensive and 
  time-consuming litigation 
  <LI>establishing a wetland delineator certification program to increase the 
  government’s reliance on wetlands delineations performed by private experts, 
  providing greater flexibility to applicants 
  <LI>improving wetlands assessment techniques to allow for better consideration 
  of wetlands functions in permit decisions. 
  <LI>clarifying exemptions of manmade wetlands from jurisdiction 
  <LI>developing guidance that will facilitate the use of programmatic general 
  permits - giving State and local governments more flexibility in wetland 
  protection and reducing unnecessary duplication 
  <LI>expanding the Wetlands Reserve Program into all 50 States and allowing 
  more types of land into the program </LI></UL>
