<P align=center>A Report to the President</P>
<P align=center>In Response to the Wildfires of 2000</P>
<P align=center>September 8, 2000</P>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>&nbsp;</FONT><B><FONT size=5>I. Executive Summary</P></B></FONT>
<P>On August 8, 2000, President Clinton asked Secretaries Babbitt and Glickman 
to prepare a report that recommends how best to respond to this year’s severe 
fires, reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and 
ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. </P>
<P>The President also asked for short-term actions that Federal agencies, in 
cooperation with States, local communities and Tribes, can take to reduce 
immediate hazards to communities in the wildland-urban interface and to ensure 
that land managers and firefighter personnel are prepared for extreme fire 
conditions in the future.</P>
<P>This report recommends a Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 budget for the wildland fire 
programs of the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior of $2.8 billion. 
Included within this total is an increase of nearly $1.6 billion above the 
President’s FY 2001 budget request in support of the report’s recommendations. 
This includes additional funding of about $340 million for fire preparedness 
resources, new funding of $88 million to increase cooperative programs in 
support of local communities, and approximately $390 million for fuels treatment 
and burned area restoration. The increase also includes about $770 million to 
replenish and enhance the Departments’ fire suppression accounts, which have 
been depleted by this year’s extraordinary costs, and to repay FY 2000 emergency 
transfers from other appropriations accounts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A summary of the key points discussed in the body of the report:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR><B>
<P>1.</B> <B>Continue to Make All Necessary Firefighting Resources Available. 
</B>The wildfires of the summer of 2000 continue to burn. As conditions change, 
new fires will start as others are controlled or die out. As a first priority, 
the Departments will continue to provide all necessary resources to ensure that 
firefighting efforts protect life and property. The Nation’s wildland 
firefighting organization is the finest in the world and deserves our strong 
support.</P><B>
<P>2. Restore Landscapes and Rebuild Communities.</B> The Departments will 
invest in restoration of communities and landscapes impacted by the 2000 fires. 
Some communities already have suffered considerable economic losses as a result 
of the fires. These losses will likely grow unless immediate, emergency action 
is taken to reduce further resource damage to soils, watersheds, and burned over 
landscapes. Key actions include:</P></DIR></DIR>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <UL><B>
      <LI>Rebuilding communities and assessing economic needs</B>. Assess the 
      economic needs of communities and, consistent with current authorities, 
      commit the financial resources necessary to assist individuals and 
      communities in rebuilding their homes, businesses, and neighborhoods. 
      Existing loan and grant programs administered by the Federal Emergency 
      Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and 
      USDA’s Forest Service and rural development programs should provide this 
      assistance. 
      <P><B></P>
      <LI>Restoring damaged landscapes. </B>Invest in landscape restoration 
      efforts such as tree planting, watershed restoration, and soil 
      stabilization and revegetation. In so doing, priority should focus on 
      efforts to protect: 
      <UL><BR>
        <LI>Public health and safety (e.g. municipal watersheds); 
        <LI>Unique natural and cultural resources (e.g. salmon and bulltrout 
        habitat) and burned-over lands that are susceptible to the introduction 
        of non-native invasive species; and 
        <LI>Other environmentally sensitive areas where economic hardship may 
        result from a lack of re-investment in restoring damaged landscapes 
        (e.g. water quality impacts on recreation and 
  tourism).</LI></UL></LI></UL></UL></UL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIR>
<DIR><B>
<P>3. Invest in Projects to Reduce Fire Risk.</B> Addressing the brush, small 
trees, and downed material that have accumulated in many forests because of past 
management activities, especially a century of suppressing wildland fires, will 
require significant investments to treat landscapes through thinning and 
prescribed fire. Since 1994, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land 
Management have increased the number of acres treated to reduce fuel build-up 
from fewer than 500,000 acres in 1994 to more than 2.4 million acres this year. 
Building on the forest policies of the past eight years, the wildland fire 
policy, and the concepts of ecosystem management, the Departments should 
establish a collaborative effort to expedite and expand landscape-level fuel 
treatments. Important dimensions of this effort include:</P></DIR></DIR>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <UL><B>
      <LI>Developing a locally led, coordinated effort between the Departments 
      of Agriculture, the Interior, and Commerce, and other appropriate agencies 
      through the establishment of integrated fuels treatment teams at the 
      regional and field levels.</B> The role of each team would be to identify 
      and prioritize projects targeted at communities most at risk, coordinate 
      environmental reviews and consultations, facilitate and encourage public 
      participation, and monitor and evaluate project implementation. Each team 
      will work closely with local communities to identify the best fit for each 
      community. 
      <P><B></P>
      <LI>Utilizing small diameter material and other biomass.</B> Develop and 
      expand markets for traditionally underutilized small diameter wood and 
      other biomass as a value added outlet for excessive fuels that have been 
      removed. 
      <P><B></P>
      <LI>Allocating necessary project funds.</B> Commit resources to support 
      planning, assessments, and project reviews to ensure that hazardous fuels 
      management is accomplished expeditiously and in an environmentally sound 
      manner.</LI></UL></UL>
  <DIR><B>
  <P>4. Work Directly with Communities.</B> Working with local communities is a 
  critical element in restoring damaged landscapes and reducing fire hazards 
  near homes and communities. To accomplish this, the Departments 
  recommend:</P></DIR>
  <DIR></DIR>
  <UL>
    <UL>
      <UL><B>
        <LI>Expanding community participation.</B> Expand the participation of 
        local communities in efforts to reduce fire hazards and the use of local 
        labor for fuels treatment and restoration work. 
        <P><B></P>
        <LI>Increasing local capacity.</B> Improve local fire protection 
        capabilities through financial and technical assistance to State, local, 
        and volunteer firefighting efforts. 
        <P><B></P>
        <LI>Learning from the public.</B> Encourage grass roots ideas and 
        solutions best suited to local communities for reducing wildfire risk. 
        Expand outreach and education to homeowners and communities about fire 
        prevention through use of programs such as Firewise.</LI></UL></UL></UL></UL>
<DIR>
<DIR><B>
<P>5. Be Accountable.</B> Establish a Cabinet-level coordinating team to ensure 
that the actions recommended by the Departments receive the highest priority. 
The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior should co-chair this team. 
Integrated management teams in the region should take primary responsibility for 
implementing the fuels treatment, restoration, and preparedness program. The 
Secretaries should assess the progress made in implementing these action items 
and provide periodic reports to the President.</P></DIR></DIR><B>

<P>II. Background</P></B></FONT>
<P>The 2000 fire season is undoubtedly one of the most challenging on record. 
Wildfires are on pace to break decades-old records. As of early September, more 
than 6.5 million acres – more than two times the ten-year national average -- 
have burned. The intensity of this year’s fires is the result of two primary 
factors: a severe drought, accompanied by a series of storms that produced 
millions of lightning strikes and windy conditions, and the long-term effects of 
more than a century of aggressively suppressing all wildfires, which has led to 
an unnatural buildup of brush and small trees in our forests and rangelands.</P>
<P>This season has stretched the capabilities of the wildland firefighting 
system -- stretched, but not broken. Such a season tests our firefighters’ 
training and the fire management infrastructure, and we have found that both are 
sound. This is a credit to the Nation’s firefighters, support personnel, 
military and international partners, managers, and local communities who provide 
crucial help and resources. </P>
<P>More than 29,000 people have been involved in firefighting efforts, including 
about 2,500 Army soldiers and Marines and fire managers from Canada, Australia, 
Mexico and New Zealand. Our partners, both military and international, are 
assisting under pre-existing agreements with the National Interagency Fire 
Center in Boise, Idaho. In addition, 1,200 fire engines, 240 helicopters, and 50 
airtankers are in use this season.</P>
<P>As challenging as this fire season has been, our firefighters have been 
successful in extinguishing more than 95 percent of wildfires before they become 
large fires (i.e., 100 acres or more). In all, they have extinguished more than 
75,000 wildfire starts this season.</P><B><I>
<P>Weather</P></B></I>
<P>The weather phenomenon known as La Nina, characterized by unusually cold 
Pacific Ocean temperatures, changed normal weather patterns when it formed two 
years ago. It caused severe, long-lasting drought across much of the country, 
drying out our forests and rangelands. The situation was exacerbated by the fact 
that the drought followed several seasons of higher-than-normal rain, which 
fueled the growth of grasses and other plants that quickly dried when the rains 
stopped. This left millions of acres susceptible to fires. To make matters 
worse, this weather pattern also spawned a series of mostly dry thunderstorms 
with heavy lightning across the West. Because of the drought conditions, 
lightning strikes have ignited more new fires than would normally be associated 
with such storms. </P>
<P>The current season corresponds to a historical pattern of extensive wildfires 
during similar unusual weather conditions. The result has been an extended, 
severe fire season, with wildfires burning simultaneously across the western 
United States<I>. </P><B>
<P>Historic wildfires </P></B></I>
<P>This year’s fires also reflect a longer-term disruption in the natural fire 
cycle that has<I> </I>increased the risk of catastrophic fires in our forests 
and rangelands<I>.</P></I>
<P>Natural fire patterns were first disrupted on a large scale with settlement 
activity during the second half of the 19th century when millions of acres of 
forests and wildlands were cleared to make way for farm crops and livestock 
pastures. During this time, timber companies, responding to a growing country’s 
need for lumber and fuel, often took the biggest trees, leaving behind slash, 
undergrowth and smaller trees. These activities set the stage for disastrous 
fires.</P>
<P>One of the most significant examples of this phenomenon occurred in 1871 in 
Peshtigo, Wisconsin, near the Great Lakes. The area around Peshtigo, mostly 
private land, had been extensively logged. Merchantable timber was removed; 
slash and dense undergrowth were left behind. On October 8, 1871, a brush fire 
quickly erupted into an inferno, consuming Peshtigo in an hour and damaging 16 
other towns and more than 1.2 million acres. The human toll -- more than 1,200 
people killed -- stands as the worst wildfire disaster in U.S. history.</P>
<P>The Peshtigo tragedy served as a deadly warning about what can happen when 
forest health is badly compromised -- in this case, by logging activities. In 
fact, Peshtigo represented the beginning of new fire cycle throughout the Great 
Lakes region that would not be broken for more than 50 years.</P>
<P>In the West, a similar pattern erupted in August 1910 with the "Big Blowup" 
-- the Great Idaho fire. As in the 2000 fire season, a severe drought plagued 
the region when dry storms, accompanied by hurricane-force wind, produced 
thousands of lightning strikes and ignited hundreds of small fires. These fires 
converged to create a monster fire that was virtually unstoppable given the 
limited firefighting capability of the times. It consumed 3 million acres in 
northern Idaho and western Montana, killed 85 people, and destroyed the property 
and livelihoods of many others. </P>
<P>Speaking about the Big Blowup, Stephen Pyne, a professor at Arizona State 
University and a leading authority on the history of fire, said, "August of 1910 
was the single most important moment in American fire history" because it 
radically changed the way the country viewed wildfires. </P>
<P>The ferocity of the Big Blowup, which came on the heels of other devastating 
fires on both private and government land, triggered a call for a systemic 
policy change. Less than a year later, the national Forest Service firefighting 
program was born. A war on all wildfires was declared. From that point on, all 
wildfires were extinguished as soon as possible.</P><B><I>
<P>Results of suppression policy </P></B></I>
<P>As a result of the all-out effort to suppress fires, the annual acreage 
consumed by wildfires in the lower 48 states dropped from 40 to 50 million acres 
a year in the early 1930s to about 5 million acres in the 1970s. During this 
time, firefighting budgets rose dramatically and firefighting tactics and 
equipment became increasingly more sophisticated and effective.</P>
<P>While the policy of aggressive fire suppression appeared to be successful, it 
set the stage for the intense fires that we see today. Full suppression of all 
wildfires initially gave our forests and wildlands a chance to heal, creating a 
false sense of security. However, after many years of suppressing fires, thus 
disrupting normal ecological cycles, changes in the structure and make-up of 
forests began to occur. Species of trees that ordinarily would have been 
eliminated from forests by periodic, low-intensity fires began to become a 
dominant part of the forest canopy. Over time, these trees became susceptible to 
insects and disease. Standing dead and dying trees in conjunction with other 
brush and downed material began to fill the forest floor. The resulting 
accumulation of these materials, when dried by extended periods of drought, 
created the fuels that promote the type of wildfires that we have seen this 
year.</P>
<P>The problems of unnaturally heavy undergrowth have been exacerbated by the 
introduction in the 1800s of non-native invasive weeds and grasses. These plants 
corrupt a region’s ecological processes, robbing the soil and native plants of 
vital nutrients and water. Invasive species such as cheatgrass, which is 
pervasive on today’s Western landscape, is one of the first plants to establish 
after a fire. It grows earlier, quicker, and higher than native grasses. Then it 
dies, dries, and becomes fuel. </P>
<P>In short, decades of aggressive fire suppression have drastically changed the 
look and fire behavior of Western forests and rangelands. Forests a century ago 
were less dense and had larger, more fire-resistant trees. For example<I>,</I> 
in northern Arizona, some lower elevation stands of ponderosa pine that once 
held 50 trees per acre, now contain 200 or more trees per acre. In addition,<I> 
</I>the composition of our forests have changed from more fire-resistant tree<I> 
</I>species to non-fire resistant species such as grand fir, Douglas-fir, and 
subalpine fir. As a result, studies show that today’s wildfires typically burn 
hotter, faster, and higher than those of the past.</P><B><I>
<P>The Changing West</P></B></I>
<P>In addition to the unnatural fuel buildup developing in our forests and 
rangelands, wildland firefighting has become more complex in the last two 
decades due to dramatic increases in the West’s population.</P>
<P>Of the 10 fastest-growing states in the U.S., eight are in the interior West. 
While the national average annual population growth is about one percent, the 
West has growth rates ranging from 2.5 to 13 percent. </P>
<P>As a result, new development is occurring in fire-prone areas, often adjacent 
to Federal land, creating a "wildland-urban interface" -- an area where 
structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped<B> 
</B>wildland. This relatively new phenomenon means that more communities and 
structures are threatened by fire. Wildland firefighters today often spend a 
great deal more time and effort protecting structures than in earlier years. 
Consequently, firefighting has become more complicated, expensive, and 
dangerous. </P><B><I>
<P>Current Fire Management Policy</P></B></I>
<P>This Administration has sought to increase efforts to reduce risks associated 
with the buildup of fuels in forests and rangelands through a variety of 
approaches, including controlled burns, the physical removal of undergrowth and 
other unnatural concentrations of fuel, and the prevention and eradication of 
invasive plants. Implicit in the Administration’s policy is the understanding 
that reversing the effects of a century of aggressive fire suppression will be 
an evolutionary process, and not one that can be completed in a few short years. 
</P>
<P>As the composition and structure of our Nation’s forests have changed over 
time, conditions that increase the likelihood of catastrophic fire have 
grown.<I> </I>Periodic, severe wildfires have occurred when weather conditions 
have produced drought, dry lightning, and high winds. This was illustrated<I> 
</I>in 1988, the year of the Yellowstone fires, and in 1994, when fires claimed 
the lives of 34 firefighters, including 14 of our country’s most elite 
firefighters in one inferno on Storm King Mountain in Colorado. This pattern has 
repeated itself in the year 2000.</P>
<P>After evaluating the 1988 and 1994 fires, foresters, fire ecologists, 
biologists, and others cautioned that the century-old policy of excluding all 
fires from the forests rangelands had brought about ecological changes that were 
increasing the likelihood of catastrophic wildfire. This was confirmed by the 
1999 General Accounting Office Report, <I>Federal Wildfire Activities</I>, which 
noted "[F]ederal acreage is susceptible to catastrophic wildfires, particularly 
where the natural vegetation has been altered by past uses of the land and a 
century of fire suppression."7</P>
<P>Given the experiences of the 1988 and 1994 fire seasons and the 
recommendations of scientific experts, the Clinton/Gore Administration initiated 
the first-ever, comprehensive interagency review of wildland fire policy. Based 
on this review, which was summarized in the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Policy 
Statement, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior predicted serious and 
potentially permanent environmental destruction and loss of private and public 
resource values from large wildfires. The policy statement recognized the 
important function that fire plays in many ecosystems and identified the 
critical role fire can play in the management of forests and watersheds. The 
policy noted that, "[C]onditions on millions of acres of wildlands increase the 
probability of large, intense fires beyond any scale yet witnessed. These severe 
fires will in turn increase the risk to humans, to property and to the land upon 
which our social and economic well-being is so intimately intertwined." </P>
<P>As three of the country’s leading wildland fire ecologists recently said, 
"Fires will inevitably occur when we have ignitions in hot, dry, windy 
conditions. . . . It is one of the great paradoxes of fire suppression that the 
more effective we are at fire suppression, the more fuels accumulate and the 
more intense the next fire will be."</P>
<P>After the policy was put in place, the Departments dramatically increased the 
number of acres treated to reduce fire risks. In 1995, Federal agencies treated 
fewer than 500,000 acres. This year, the Departments will remove brush, small 
trees, and downed material from more than 2.4 million acres using small, 
intentionally set, "prescribed" fires and mechanical thinning techniques. </P>
<P>Across the country, the Departments have been working to assess the important 
roles that fire plays in different ecosystems and to integrate this knowledge 
into management practices. They also began the Joint Fire Science Project to 
provide a scientific basis for helping the Departments prioritize their fire 
prevention activities on the ground. In 1999, this project developed maps, with 
state-level resolution, that identify forests most at risk from large, 
catastrophic fires. Work continues to improve the resolution of the maps so that 
they can be used to help assist with strategic planning, prioritizing resources 
and identifying specific projects on the ground.</P>
<P>The Departments have been moving quickly to incorporate this new information 
in their budget requests and other policy documents, but the severity of this 
year’s fire season has added extra impetus to move these recommendations 
forward.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B><FONT size=5>
<P>III. Key Elements Of The Administration’s Wildland Fire Management 
Policy</P></B></FONT>
<P>The new wildland fire policy that the Administration has developed in recent 
years acknowledges the dangers posed by the long-term building of excessive fuel 
levels in our forests and rangelands. It seeks to reduce those risks through a 
variety of approaches, including controlled burns, the physical removal of 
undergrowth and other unnatural concentration of fuel, and attacks on invasive 
plants. Implicit in the Administration’s policy is the understanding that 
reversing the effects a century of aggressive fire suppression has had on our 
nation’s public lands will be an evolutionary process, not one that can be 
completed in a few short years.</P>
<P>The key elements of the Administration’s wildland fire management policy are 
set forth below. They include: (1) integrated firefighting management and 
preparedness; (2) reducing hazardous fuel accumulations; and (3) local community 
coordination and outreach. </P>
<P>Notably, the Administration’s wildland fire policy does not rely on 
commercial logging or new road building to reduce fire risks and can be 
implemented under its current forest and land management polices. The removal of 
large, merchantable trees from forests does not reduce fire risk and may, in 
fact, increase such risk. Fire ecologists note that large trees are "insurance 
for the future – they are critical to ecosystem resilience." Targeting smaller 
trees and leaving both large trees and snags standing addresses the core of the 
fuels problem.</P>
<P>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) recently addressed the effect of 
logging on wildfires in an August 2000 report and found that the current wave of 
forest fires is not related to a decline in timber harvest on Federal lands. 
From a quantitative perspective, the CRS study indicates a very weak 
relationship between acres logged and the extent and severity of forest fires. 
To the contrary, in the most recent period (1980 through 1999) the data indicate 
that fewer acres burned in areas where logging activity was limited. </P>
<P>Since 1945, the fluctuation pattern of acres burned in the 11 Western States 
has shown a steady rise with some of the worst fire seasons in the late 1980’s, 
when timber harvest peaked at 12 billion board feet. In fact, the 10-year 
average annual number of acres burned nationwide in the 1980’s when logging 
activity was heaviest was higher (4.2 million acres) than in both the 1970’s 
(3.2 million acres) and the 1990’s (3.6 million acres). </P>
<P>Qualitative analysis by CRS supports the same conclusion. The CRS stated: 
"[T]imber harvesting removes the relatively large diameter wood that can be 
converted into wood products, but leaves behind the small material, especially 
twigs and needles. The concentration of these fine fuels on the forest floor 
increases the rate of spread of wildfires."</P>
<P>Similarly, the National Research Council found that logging and clearcutting 
can cause rapid regeneration of shrubs and trees that can create highly 
flammable fuel conditions within a few years of cutting. Without adequate 
treatment of small woody material, logging may exacerbate fire risk rather than 
lower it.</P>
<P>The President has proposed to protect more than 43 million acres of remaining 
National Forest roadless areas. These areas have tremendous ecological value and 
serve as important watersheds, areas for recreation, and important habitat for 
fish and wildlife.</P>
<P>Some critics have expressed concern that the Administration’s proposed 
roadless area policy could increase wildfire risks. The facts do not support 
this conclusion. To the contrary, all available evidence suggests that fire 
starts may be fewer in unroaded than in previously roaded forests. Fires are 
almost twice as likely to occur in roaded areas as they are in roadless areas. 
</P>
<P>The proposed roadless area protection policy would not affect the Federal 
agencies’ ability to control wildland fires. The agencies’ success rate in 
extinguishing wildfires on initial attack is the same in roadless, wilderness, 
and roaded areas. Approximately 98 per cent of all fires are extinguished before 
the grow large and out of control. In addition, the proposed roadless policy 
would allow road construction if a wildland fire threatened public health and 
safety. </P>
<P>The Forest Service has identified 89 million acres of National Forest System 
land that have a moderate to high risk of catastrophic fire. Of these acres, 
less than 16 per cent are in inventoried roadless areas. Moreover, the Forest 
Service would prioritize efforts to reduce fuels in areas that have already been 
roaded because these areas tend to be much closer to communities and have higher 
fire risks. Indeed, given current funding levels and the scope of the fuels 
issue, the Forest Service would do fuels reduction work for 15 years in roaded 
areas.</P><B><U>
<P>A. Firefighting Management and Preparedness</P></B></U>
<P>The Administration’s review of wildland fire policy validated the importance 
of maintaining an integrated firefighting management structure that can deliver 
first-class firefighting resources to the front lines of wildfires.</P>
<P>The Departments operate under a model interagency framework that has been 
developed over two decades. Program management and coordination takes place 
through a national-level group, the National Wildfire Coordination Group, which 
includes representatives from the States. It determines training, equipment, and 
other standards to ensure that all Federal, State, and local agencies can easily 
operate together.</P>
<P>The fire program operates under a command structure called Incident Command 
System to respond to and manage wildfires on an intergovernmental basis. The 
system includes local fire operations that are supported by a national network 
of coordination centers and supply bases. The National Interagency Fire Center 
in Boise, Idaho, oversees national wildfire operations. </P>
<P>The Administration has provided full support to the interagency firefighting 
effort (see attachment A) and has implemented a series of budget and management 
improvements. </P>
<P>Based on lessons of recent fire seasons, especially 1999 and 2000, the 
Departments have reassessed the assumptions and variables used in planning 
models to determine the resources needed to fight fires. They recommend funding 
100 percent of this revised estimate of full preparedness. </P>
<P>In addition, the Departments have devoted special attention to firefighting 
training and coordination. As part of this emphasis, the Departments have added 
training courses, modified current classes, and, in some cases, raised the 
qualifications for certain positions. In 1999, the Departments issued a revised 
qualifications system for firefighting and prescribed fire positions in order to 
ensure that the U.S. continues to field the finest firefighting and prescribed 
fire force in the world. </P><B><U>
<P>B. Reducing Hazardous Fuel Accumulations</P></B></U>
<P>Implicit in the Administration’s efforts to reduce wildfire risk through the 
elimination of brush, small diameter trees, and other fuels and the 
reintroduction of fire to forest and rangeland ecosystems is the understanding 
that reversing the effects a century of aggressive fire suppression will be an 
evolutionary process, not one that can be completed in a few short years.</P>
<P>The Administration’s forest policies have emphasized the importance of 
reducing hazardous fuel accumulations in our forests and rangelands and 
restoring the health and natural processes of forest and rangeland ecosystems. 
Reduction of fuels can be achieved in a variety of ways -- by mechanical, 
chemical, biological and manual methods. The prudent use of fire, either alone 
or in combination with other means, can be one of the most effective means of 
reducing such hazardous fuel. In addition, early research has demonstrated that 
the selective removal of undergrowth and non-native plant species, can 
significantly reduce fire risks. The Administration is testing the effectiveness 
of these strategies’ pilot projects. </P>
<P>By way of example, in a report published in <I>Proceedings from the Joint 
Fire Science Conference and Workshop, 1991</I>, researchers studied four large 
wildfires in Montana, Washington, California, and Arizona to determine if 
previous fuel treatment and thinning activities had any impact on fire severity. 
The sites selected for study underwent treatment within ten years prior to being 
burned in wildland fires. The findings indicated that fuel treatments mitigate 
fire severity. "Although topography and weather may play a more important role 
in fuels in governing fire behavior, topography and weather cannot be 
realistically manipulated to reduce fire severity. Fuels are the leg of the fire 
environment triangle that land managers can change to achieve desired post-fire 
condition."</P>
<P>The General Accounting Office (GAO Report GAO/RCED-99-65) also has emphasized 
the need for fuels management, concluding that "the most extensive and serious 
problem related to the health of forests in the interior West is the 
over-accumulation of vegetation, which has caused an increasing number of large, 
intense, uncontrollable, and catastrophically destructive wildfires."</P>
<P>The Departments have moved forward with an aggressive program to thin forest 
stands to reduce small diameter trees, underbrush and accumulated fuels</P>
<P>Between 1994 and this year, the Departments increased their efforts to reduce 
fire risks through prescribed fire and thinning by close to 500 percent (see 
attachment B). In 1999, the Departments treated 2.2 million acres. At the same 
time, the Departments have increased the use of prescribed fires to begin 
steering our forests and rangelands back toward more healthy conditions. </P>
<P>Presently, both Departments are developing strategies to address aggressive 
fuel management. These call for a targeted approach to removing excessive fuel 
through mechanical treatments and prescribed fire in order to protect 
communities at risk, help prevent insect and disease damage, and generally 
improve overall ecosystem health and sustainability. Obviously, large-scale 
improvements will take several years to occur against the backdrop of a 
century-long suppression policy. Nonetheless, this year’s fire season is 
providing some evidence that the controlled reintroduction of fire is beginning 
to bear fruit.</P>
<P>An example involves a wildfire in South Dakota’s Black Hills. The Jasper 
fire, more than 82,000 acres, is the largest fire in the history of the Black 
Hills. It has displayed the most severe fire behavior in the history of the 
area, burning 50,000 acres in only a few hours. During the course of a fierce 
crown -- fire run -- where flames roar through the forest through the tops of 
the trees -- the fire burned into a section of the Jewel Cave National Park 
where a prescribed fire had been conducted near the Park’s visitor center and 
housing area. When it hit the prescribed burn area, the fire changed from a 
crown-fire to a ground-based fire where it could be effectively fought. Fire 
crews were able to remain in the area only because of the defensible space and 
barriers created. As a result, none of the Park’s major structures burned. </P>
<P>As dramatic as this example is, an equally dramatic example illustrates the 
risks that are inherent in prescribed fires if they are not implemented in a 
careful and well-managed manner.</P>
<P>Specifically, the Cerro Grande fire near New Mexico’s Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, which began as a prescribed fire in Bandelier National Park in New 
Mexico in May, is a terrible reminder of the costs if prescribed fires are not 
well-planned and executed. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, 18,000 
people were evacuated, and 48,000 acres were burned. The Administration fully 
supported a compensation program enacted by Congress for the victims of the 
fire. The Administration is also fully committed to implementing changes in 
prescribed fire policy and procedures as a result of investigations and reviews 
of the Cerro Grande fire.</P><B><U>
<P>C. Local Community Coordination and Outreach</P></B></U>
<P>The Administration’s wildland fire policy recognizes that effective fire 
management requires close coordination with local communities, particularly 
those communities that are in the wildland-urban interface. As the management of 
private lands has become a key factor in the fire-risk equation, the Departments 
have recognized the importance of providing outreach, education, and support for 
local communities who must play a primary role in reducing fire hazards in and 
near their communities. </P>
<P>As discussed above, the changing demographics are expanding the 
wildland-urban interface and creating new challenges for fighting wildland 
fires. Increasingly, many homes on private land in and around new communities 
are at risk. Indeed, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) estimates 
that wildfires destroyed more than 9,000 homes between 1985 and 1995. Officials 
further believe that the number of homes damaged by wildfires in the 1990s is 
six times that of the previous decade. More than 1,000 homes have been destroyed 
during this summer alone. </P>
<P>Safe and effective protection in these areas demands close coordination 
between local, State, Federal and Tribal firefighting resources. Typically, the 
primary burden for wildland-urban interface fire protection falls to property 
owners and State and local governments. Rural and volunteer fire departments 
provide the front line of defense, or initial attack, on up to 90 percent of 
these high-risk and costly fires. While they have a good record in rapidly 
suppressing traditional wildland fires, these local resources often struggle to 
effectively address the complex demands of fighting fire in the wildland-urban 
interface. </P>
<P>The Departments also have taken steps to assist communities in developing 
their own firefighting capabilities. The Forest Service’s State and Volunteer 
Fire Assistance Programs, for example, provide technical and financial 
assistance to local firefighting resources to help promote effective and 
coordinated integrated fire management response. Through the Volunteer Fire 
Assistance Program, the Forest Service has been successful in providing 
firefighting equipment to rural fire departments and in training their 
firefighters to meet Federal interagency standards. </P>
<P>The Departments have made available the training facilities at the National 
Interagency Training Center in Boise, Idaho, to community-based firefighters. By 
way of example, the BLM Boise District in Idaho has trained more than 1,500 
firefighters from 57 different fire departments from both urban (e.g. Boise) and 
rural areas within the last five years. Training opportunities recently have 
been extended to ranchers who are interested in fire proofing their properties 
and understanding basic fire suppression tactics. The Boise District also has 
formalized an agreement with Ada County, Idaho, to train and integrate county 
employees into certain firefighting operations and promote an effective and 
coordinated integrated fire management response.</P>
<P>The problem of fires in the wildland-urban interface is multifaceted and will 
not be solved overnight. Nevertheless, there are a number of short-term actions 
that the Federal government, in cooperation with State, tribal and local 
governments, can take to reduce the future risk to communities and 
resources.</P>
<P>A top priority for reducing risk is to reduce fuels in forests and rangelands 
adjacent to, and within communities. Particular emphasis should be placed on 
projects where fuel treatment can also be accomplished on adjoining State, 
private, or other nonfederal land so as to extend greater protection across the 
landscape. This provides protection from catastrophic fires that develop on 
public lands. This can be accomplished by making available adequate incentives 
and technical assistance to communities and private landowners to encourage the 
reduction of hazardous fuels around homeowner properties. These individual 
actions will not only provide greater personal protection but will also increase 
the safety and effectiveness of firefighting personnel. When done on a large 
scale, fuel reduction around individual homes can result in greater overall 
protection for an entire landscape or watershed. </P>
<P>The Departments have been implementing a number of programs to educate 
communities and homeowners in recently burned areas and high-risk urban-wildland 
interface areas about fire hazards. The Forest Service’s Firewise program, for 
example, is a very successful program designed to educate rural homeowners about 
precautions they can take to make their homes more fire resistant and more 
easily defendable by local fire departments. Firewise specifically helps 
communities and homeowners recognize fire hazards, design Firewise homes and 
landscapes, and make wise planning, zoning, and building material choices. These 
efforts play an important role in reducing the loss of lives and property -- as 
well as tremendous government expense -- in the wildland-urban interface.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B><FONT size=5>
<P>IV. Consequences of the 2000 Wildfire Season</P></FONT><I>
<P>Economic Impacts</P></B></I>
<P>Although the data needed for a thorough assessment of economic impacts on 
areas affected by this year’s wildfires are not yet available, preliminary 
reports indicate that the losses from the 2000 wildfires will be substantial and 
widespread. Montana Governor Racicot estimated that businesses were losing about 
$3 million a day because of fire. Idaho Governor Kempthorne estimated losses in 
Idaho at $54.1 million overall, of which $15 million comes from about 500 small 
businesses. He estimated another $12.5 million in agricultural losses and $12 
million in watershed restoration costs. </P>
<P>Economic impacts arise both directly from fire damage and indirectly from 
changes in local economic activity, such as a drop in tourism. Both direct and 
indirect effects of the wildfires have exacted a heavy economic toll on many 
local, often rural communities. </P>
<P>In Hamilton, Montana, the loss of more than 300,000 acres to fire prompted 
officials to close much of the public land essential to Montana’s tourism 
economy. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce reports that seven chamber members 
alone had reported losses totaling $500,000. A local fishing guide who relies on 
tourists told reporters that he had lost 76 percent of his normal business in 
one month alone.</P>
<P>In Idaho, two ranchers lost more than 700 cattle during a 20,000-acre fire 
near Dietrich, with a value of at least half a million dollars. Insurance will 
cover about 25 percent for one of the ranchers. The other rancher had no 
insurance on his herds.</P>
<P>President Clinton responded to requests from the Governors of Idaho and 
Montana and declared the two states as disaster areas, making them eligible for 
Federal relief. One-stop centers are being established so that citizens can 
obtain service and financial assistance from all relevant agencies.</P><B><I>
<P>Damage to Natural Resources</P></B></I>
<P>In addition to these types of direct, out-of-pocket impacts on citizens, it 
is likely that losses in resource values will total billions of dollars.</P>
<P>The consequences of this year’s wildfires on our country’s natural resources 
are as vast as they are varied. The wildland fires of 2000 fires have burned 
both public and private lands over a broad spectrum of semi-arid rangeland and 
forested ecosystems, often encompassing entire watersheds critical to community 
water supplies. Compared to historic fire events, recent fires have burned with 
such intensity that the ecosystems of many of these extensively burned areas 
have been drastically changed. Without intervention, these burned lands will 
recover slowly and be susceptible to undesirable changes in vegetation 
composition. For example, plant species such as cheatgrass often become 
established in burned areas, creating additional fire risks and disrupting 
natural systems. </P>
<P>The immediate problems associated with the severity of fire will extend well 
into winter. With a lack of vegetation on hillsides, for example, the likelihood 
that rain and snowfall will create flooding and mudslides increases. In turn, 
the water quality of streams and rivers are damaged, which can kill native fish. 
Many wildlife populations also have been killed or disrupted.</P>
<P>Non-native invasive plant species -- weeds -- thrive on both public and 
private lands in the wake of wildland fires, presenting several problems. These 
opportunistic plants compete with and can overtake native plant communities. In 
addition, their proliferation provides powerful fuel for wildfires, increasing 
the likelihood of and severity of future wildfires. Cheatgrass, in particular, 
has spread throughout the West on degraded rangelands, increasing in density on 
burned areas. In the Great Basin ecosystem alone, one out of every three acres 
is either dominated or threatened by cheatgrass.</P><B><I>
<P>Harvesting Burned Trees</P></B></I>
<P>The appropriate harvest of fire-damaged timber can provide a means of 
recovering some of the economic value of forest stands and improving landscape 
health, but it is not a panacea for reducing wildfire risk. Removal activities 
that do not comply with environmental requirements can add to the damage 
associated with fire-impacted landscapes.</P>
<P>The Departments will continue to consider the option of harvesting 
fire-damaged trees when appropriate, with priority placed on those areas where 
roads already exist and where risks to communities from future wildfire are 
greatest. However, as has been the Departments’ practice, such timber sales 
should proceed only after all environmental laws and procedures are followed and 
the affected communities are afforded the opportunity to participate in the 
process. </P>
<P>In the past, some Congressionally mandated salvage logging resulted in the 
harvest of green, healthy trees in addition to dead and dying timber. 
Congressional direction contained in the 1995 Rescissions Act -- known as the 
"Salvage Rider" -- placed priority on salvage logging over environmental 
protection. This is not an acceptable approach to harvesting fire-damaged 
trees.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P><FONT size=5>
<P>V. Key Points and Recommendations</P></FONT>
<P>1. Continue to Make All Necessary Firefighting Resources Available.</P>
<P>As a first priority, the Departments will continue to provide all necessary 
resources to ensure that fire suppression efforts are at maximum efficiency in 
order to protect life and property. The United States’ wildland firefighting 
organization is the finest in the world and deserves our strong support. To 
ensure continued readiness of the firefighting force, the Departments recommend 
providing additional resources for firefighting activities. </P></B>
<P>Wildland firefighting is a difficult and dangerous job, and it is essential 
that our firefighters continue to be well trained, with the appropriate 
equipment and resources they need to do their job. Safety of our firefighters 
and members of the public is, and always will be, the Administration’s number 
one priority. We will continue to provide all necessary resources that our 
firefighting force need to continue the battle against this year’s fires in as 
safe a manner as possible. </P>
<P>To fully fund the fire management preparedness programs, the Departments 
recommend additional resources in FY 2001 of about $337 million, including $204 
million for the Forest Service and $133 million for the Department of the 
Interior over the President’s request. This continuing funding would provide the 
Departments’ fire management organizations with the capability to prevent, 
detect, and take prompt, effective action to control wildfires. These funds also 
would support the personnel, equipment, and technology necessary to conduct 
proper planning, prevention, detection, information, education, and 
training.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR><B></DIR></DIR>
<P>2. Restore Damaged Landscapes and Rebuild Communities.</P>
<P>After ensuring that suppression resources are sufficient, invest in the 
restoration of communities and landscapes impacted by the year 2000 fires. The 
Departments also recommend that investments in the treatment of landscapes 
through thinning and the restoration of fire be continued and expanded to help 
reduce the risk of catastrophic fires. </P>
<P>Providing Economic Assistance to Hard-Hit Communities</P></B>
<P>As discussed above, the year 2000 fires have hit many communities hard. Both 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) are responding to the immediate need for assistance. FEMA 
anticipates that more than 10,000 citizens from Idaho and Montana may qualify 
for disaster unemployment assistance, and it is anticipated that the SBA may 
offer more than $50 million in small business loans to assist affected 
businessmen. The USDA’s Forest Service and rural development program also are 
preparing to provide immediate economic assistance, using existing resources. In 
receiving grant or loan applications under these programs, the Department of 
Agriculture will fully consider the impact of the season’s wildfires on 
communities seeking assistance, giving such communities a competitive advantage 
in the USDA grant-making and loan-making.</P>
<P>In addition to these short-term actions, the Departments recommend that 
stabilization and restoration investments be made in areas that have been 
damaged by fire and which are at risk of erosion, invasive species germination 
or water supply contamination. These investments should be made in a manner that 
provides maximum benefit to hard-hit communities with local contractors and the 
local workforce being utilized to maximum extent possible.</P>
<P>In a similar vein, the Departments also are recommending below that forest 
treatment activities be stepped up in intensity. These activities can be labor 
intensive and, once again, the Departments intend to involve local communities 
and the local workforce in implementing these activities. </P>
<P>Key aspects of these programs are set forth below.</P><B>
<P>Burned Area Stabilization and Restoration</P><I>
<P>Stabilization </P></B></I>
<P>Stabilization activities include short-term actions to remove hazards and 
stabilize soils and slopes. Examples of specific actions or "treatments" might 
include the removal of hazards; seeding by helicopter, plane, or by hand; 
constructing dams or other structures to hold soil on the slope; placing bundles 
of straw on the ground, parallel to the slope to slow the movement of soil down 
hill; contour furrowing or trenching (ditches cut into the mountain or hillsides 
to catch soil moving down hill); correcting road drainage by realigning poorly 
designed roads and culvert replacement to manage water and soil movement after 
the fire; and temporarily fencing cattle and people out of burned areas.</P>
<P>Priorities for stabilization activities include protecting human life and 
property; protecting public health and safety; stabilizing municipal watersheds; 
stabilizing steep slopes and unstable terrain; protecting archeological 
resources; and replacing culverts.</P><B><I>
<P>Restoration</P></B></I>
<P>Restoration activities include longer-term actions to repair or improve lands 
that are unlikely to recover naturally from severe fire damage. Examples of 
specific actions or "treatments" might include planting or seeding native 
species; reforesting desired tree species; chemical or mechanical treatment to 
reduce competition; and other efforts to limit the spread of invasive 
species.<I> </P></I>
<P>Priorities for restoration activities include preventing introduction of 
non-native invasive species; promoting restoration of ecosystem structure and 
composition; rehabilitating threatened and endangered species habitat; and 
improving water quality.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Because of the large amount of acreage affected by this year’s fires, the 
Departments propose to develop a stabilization and restoration plan that is 
coordinated with all affected agencies, including appropriate state and local 
agencies. </P>
<P>Responsibility for implementation of individual projects lies at the 
field-level. Projects covering multiple jurisdictions will be planned and 
implemented on an interagency basis. The Departments recognize that the scope of 
this effort will require additional resources. Three specific aspects of the 
program may require special support: </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(1) <I>Native plant/seed sources: </I>Availability of native seeds and plant 
materials is limited. Significant effort will be needed to encourage the 
production of seeds and plant materials by the private sector and develop agency 
seed storage capabilities to support restoration activities.</P>
<P>(2) <I>Science and research:</I> Significant information collection, 
research, and data analysis is required to assess the effectiveness of 
restoration techniques and develop improved techniques. Current technologies and 
techniques are largely based on experiences from agricultural practices in the 
early part of the 20th Century. Special attention will be focused on techniques 
applicable to non-agricultural lands and to treatments using native seeds and 
plants.</P>
<P>(3) <I>Capital equipment:</I> The current post-fire program relies on a 
limited amount of capital equipment (e.g., drill-seeders), much of which is not 
dedicated to this program. Additional equipment will be needed to support the 
expanded requirements, especially in the application of native seeds.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<P>3. Investments in Projects to Reduce Fire Risk</P></B>
<P>As discussed above, the Departments have been implementing new approaches to 
address the long-term buildup of hazardous fuels in our forests and rangelands. 
The fires of 2000 have underscored the importance of pursuing an aggressive 
program to address the fuels problem with the help of local communities, 
particularly those in wildland-urban interface areas, where threats to lives and 
property are greater and the complexity and costs of treatments higher. </P>
<P>The Departments recommend continuing current fuel reduction strategies and 
seeking additional budgetary resources to treat additional acreage. The 
Departments are requesting $257 million for fuels reduction activities in FY 
2001, over the President’s request including $115 million for the Forest Service 
and $142 million for the Department of the Interior. These funds will cover 
accelerated treatments, especially in the wildland-urban interface area and will 
work to support additional research and eradication of invasive species. Funding 
will be available to support Endangered Species Act consultation work by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.</P><B>
<P>Implementation of Fuels Reduction Program </P></B>
<P>The most significant implementation challenge for the Departments is to 
substantially increase the number of acres of forestlands that receive fuels 
treatment. Both Departments are utilizing one aspect of fuels treatments, 
prescribed fires, increasingly. That program will continue to play a key role, 
although the lessons from the Cerro Grande fire demand that this strategy be 
implemented with great care. In that regard, the Departments will implement 
recommendations from the independent review of the Cerro Grande fire.</P>
<P>In addition to prescribed burns, the physical removal of undergrowth and 
other fuels needs to be stepped up in intensity in order to have a more 
significant impact on dangerous fuels buildup. Because of the importance of this 
activity, the Departments recommend that experienced personnel be dedicated full 
time to this activity, with direct chains of command to the Secretaries of 
Agriculture and the Interior. The Secretaries, in turn, should meet periodically 
to assess the progress of these efforts. </P><B><I>
<P>Markets for Removed Materials</P></B></I>
<P>Because much of the hazardous fuels in forests are excessive levels of 
forest-based biomass -- dead, diseased and down trees -- and small diameter 
trees, there are several benefits of finding economical uses for this material, 
including helping offset forest restoration cost; providing economic 
opportunities for rural, forest-dependent communities; reducing the risks from 
catastrophic wildfires; protecting watersheds; helping restore forest 
resiliency, and protecting the environment. </P>
<P>USDA Forest Service research teams are working to develop new uses for small 
tress and new ways to process them. A need exists to transfer and commercialize 
new technology as it comes on line and to develop and expand local markets for 
these products. Both Departments propose to partner with communities, 
universities, and businesses to conduct additional research on the stimulation 
of small diameter and other vegetative products industries.</P>
<P>Small diameter logs, for example, can be used for housing material such as 
trim, siding, and sub-flooring. Recent technology now makes it possible for wood 
composites - fibers, flakes and strands - from lower quality species of trees 
such as juniper, pinyon pine, and insect-killed white fir to be used 
successfully for particleboard and replacement filler for thermoplastic 
composites that make up a wide range of consumer products such as highway signs. 
Similar uses are being expanded for pulp chips. The woody residues that make up 
a forest’s undergrowth has historically been burned or allowed to accumulate in 
huge piles on the forest floor. This material could potentially be economically 
used as compost and mulch material.</P><B><I>
<P>Research Needs</P></B></I>
<P>Given the severity of this year’s fires and the additional fuels management 
and restoration activities recommended by this report, the Departments have a 
number of additional research needs. They recommend research on the relationship 
between invasive species and fires and the effectiveness of various treatment 
efforts. They also recommend research based on recent fire seasons regarding 
relationships between land management practices and the occurrence and intensity 
of fires.</P><B><I>
<P>Budget </P></B></I>
<P>The two Departments request additional resources of $130 million in FY 2001 
over the President’s request to fully fund a burned area restoration program as 
described above, including $45 million for the Forest Service and $85 million 
for the Department of the Interior. </P><B>
<P>4. Work Directly with Local Communities.</P></B>
<P>Working with local communities is a critical element in restoring damaged 
landscapes and reducing fire hazards proximate to homes and communities. To 
accomplish this, the Departments recommend:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR><B>
<P>a. Expanding the participation of local communities in efforts to reduce fire 
hazards and the use of local labor for fuels treatment and restoration work.</P>
<P>b. Improving local fire protection capabilities through financial and 
technical assistance to state, local, and volunteer firefighting efforts.</P>
<P>c. Assisting in the development of markets for traditionally underutilized 
small diameter wood as a value added outlet for removed fuels.</P>
<P>d. Encouraging a dialogue within and among communities regarding 
opportunities for reducing wildfire risk and expanding outreach and education to 
homeowners and communities about fire prevention through use of programs such as 
Firewise.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></B>
<P>As discussed above, the Departments have been working with communities on 
fire-related activities through a variety of programs. On the operational side, 
the National Interagency Fire Center provides training opportunities for local 
firefighters, and the Fire Center has developed cooperative arrangements with 
many local and state entities to facilitate coordinated firefighting efforts. 
The Departments also work with local communities to assist in fire protection 
activities through the Firewise program and other outreach efforts. In addition, 
the Departments currently work with local communities on fuels treatment and 
post-fire restoration projects. </P>
<P>Although Federal agencies are engaged in these activities on an on-going 
basis, the Departments recommend that a significant new initiative be undertaken 
to coordinate appropriate investments and outreach activities with affected 
communities. The proposed initiative would focus on three major arenas: (1) 
improving community-based firefighting capabilities and coordination with state 
and Federal firefighting efforts; (2) working closely with communities-at-risk 
in implementing post-fire restoration activities and fuels reduction activities; 
and (3) expanding joint education and outreach efforts regarding fire prevention 
and mitigation in the wildlife-urban interface. </P>
<P>Rural and volunteer fire departments provide the front line of defense, or 
initial attack, on up to 90 percent of the communities. Volunteer fire 
departments are the backbone of fire protection in America. County, State, and 
Federal agencies provide immediate backup to local fire departments when a 
wildland-urban interface fire gets out of control. Strong readiness capability 
at the state and local levels go hand-in-hand with optimal efficiency at the 
Federal level. The level of funding being proposed will provide a more optimum 
efficiency level for the states and local fire departments in the impacted 
areas. </P><B><I>
<P>Budget</P></B></I>
<P>To support this initiative for community involvement and participation, 
additional funding of $88 million in FY 2001 is required. The USDA Forest 
Service proposes increases of $53.8 million for state and volunteer fire 
assistance, as well as an additional $12.5 million for economic action programs 
and $12 million for forest health activity. The Department of the Interior 
proposes a new program to support rural fire districts, particularly those 
intermingled with Bureau of Land Management lands. Funding of $10 million is 
proposed for FY 2001.</P><B>
<P>5. Be Accountable </P>
<P>A Cabinet-level management structure should be established to ensure that the 
actions recommended by the Departments receive the highest priority. The 
Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior should co-chair this effort. 
Regional integrated management teams should be accountable for fuels treatment, 
restoration, and fire preparedness. Local teams, working closely with 
communities and other agency partners, would manage projects on the ground. 
</P></B>
<P>Wildland fires know no jurisdictional boundaries. It is for that reason that 
the five primary Federal agencies that have operational responsibility for 
preparing for, and responding to, wildfires, formed the National Interagency 
Fire Center. The Fire Center is a model of cross-agency cooperation and 
accountability, and it provides a key focal point for coordination with state 
and local firefighting efforts.</P>
<P>As with fighting fires, Federal, State and local governments will have to 
cooperate to restore damaged lands, invest in protecting affected communities, 
and reduce hazardous fuel loads. </P>
<P>A number of existing, regional integrated management teams are in place to 
assist in the setting of regional priorities for land restoration, fuels 
treatment, and community cooperation and outreach. The Departments recommend 
that these regional structures be utilized and/or retooled, as appropriate, to 
provide a focal point for these initiatives.</P>
<P>The Departments would also establish locally led teams with the Department of 
Commerce and other appropriate agencies. These integrated teams would identify 
specific land restoration, fuels treatment, and preparedness projects; 
coordinate environmental reviews and consultations; facilitate and encourage 
public participation; and monitor and evaluate project implementation. </P>
<P>Because of the critical importance of these matters, the Departments 
recommend Cabinet-level oversight of the implementation of these initiatives, 
co-chaired by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior. Among other 
things, the new management team would be responsible for ensuring that 
appropriate performance objectives are established and met, ensuring that 
adequate financial and other resources are made available, establishing a system 
for identifying and addressing implementation issues promptly, and ensuring that 
the environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act, and 
all other environmental requirements, are undertaken and completed on a timely 
basis. </P>
<P>The Departments recommend that the Cabinet-level group assess the progress 
towards implementing these tasks, and provide periodic reports to the 
President.</P><B><FONT face=Arial size=5>

<P align=center>Appendix: Funding Summary</P></B></FONT>
<P>Nearly $1.6 billion in additional resources over the President’s FY2001 
Budget requests for the USDA Forest Service and the US Department of the 
Interior will be required in FY 2001 to meet the objectives of this report. This 
includes $897 million more for the USDA Forest Service, and $682 million more 
for the US Department of the Interior.</P>
<P>To continue the momentum gained by the additional FY 2001 resources, future 
funding for fiscal year 2002 and the out years will need to be maintained for 
these same program components. Tables 1 through 3 summarize these needs for 
FY2001, by totals and by each Department.</P><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=2>

<P>*New program proposed in the Report to the President</P>
<P>** No DOI equivalent to these USDA Forest Service programs</P></FONT><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following briefly describes each program component, including total 
funding requirements for FY 2001 (President’s request plus additional resources 
now being requested):</P>
<P>Fire Preparedness</P></B>
<P>Provides the fire management organization with the capability to prevent, 
detect, or take prompt, effective initial attack suppression action on 
wildfires. Preparedness activities include planning, prevention, detection, 
information and education, pre-incident training, equipment and supply purchase 
and replacement, and other preparedness activities. Funding estimates are based 
on prediction models that determine a cost-effective level of preparedness for 
initial and extended attack. </P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $608 million for recurring readiness and 
  program management costs, including fire science and research. 
  <LI>For the US Department of the Interior $315 million for recurring readiness 
  and program management costs; one-time readiness and program management costs; 
  fire science and research; and fire management facilities 
repair.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Fire Operations - Suppression</P></B>
<P>Provides costs directly associated with fire suppression activities 
(personnel costs, contracts, aviation, supplies, and so on)</P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $320 million. 
  <LI>For US Department of the Interior $153 million.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Fire Operations – Fuels Management</P></B><FONT face=TIMES>
<P>Use of prescribed fire, mechanical removal, and other techniques to 
remove/reduce hazardous levels of fuels in order to reduce risks to communities 
and to restore natural fire regimes to wildlands. Includes funding to support 
non-fire disciplines (biology, wildlife, hydrologists, etc.) necessary to 
conduct planning and assessment activities.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $190 million including $20 million for 
  research and $11.5 million to support environmental clearances. 
  <LI>For US Department of the Interior $195 million, including at least $20 
  million to support environmental clearances.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Fire Operations – Burned Area Rehabilitation</P></B>
<P>Provides for post-fire stabilization and restoration of burned lands. 
Short-term stabilization efforts remove hazards and address erosion, flooding, 
and mudslide problems. Longer-term rehabilitation are targeted on those portions 
of fires that burned severely, thus less likely to revegetate naturally. Special 
attention focused on lands subject to non-native, invasive species. </P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $45 million. 
  <LI>For US Department of the Interior $105 million. 
  <LI>Both Departments will have flexibility to increase these levels if 
  estimated needs in other fire-related activities are less than currently 
  projected.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Emergency Fire Contingency</P></B>
<P>Provides additional emergency funds for Fire Suppression activities that are 
only released to the agency upon Presidential declaration that regular 
suppression funds are insufficient. These funds ensure that funding is always 
available to fight wildfires.</P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $426 million, of which $276 is to repay the 
  Knutsen-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund. 
  <LI>For US Department of the Interior $200 million, including estimated $75 
  million to repay a September 2000 Section 102 transfer.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>State and Volunteer Fire Assistance</P></B>
<P>State fire assistance in the USDA Forest Service provides technical training, 
financial assistance, and equipment to States to ensure that Federal, State, and 
local agencies can deliver a uniform and coordinated suppression response to 
wildfire. Special emphasis will be placed on a Wildland-Urban Interface 
component. </P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $86 million including $20 million for 
  incentives for high priority forest management practices on their lands to 
  reduce fire risk and fuel loads and $4 million for high priority fire 
  education and prevention programs in the wildland-urban interface. 
  <LI>US Department of the Interior has no equivalent program; see Rural Fire 
  Assistance program below.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Rural Fire Assistance</P></B>
<P>Rural fire district assistance in the Department of the Interior is a new 
program to provide technical and financial support to volunteer fire departments 
that protect communities with populations of less than 10,000. Emphasis is on 
areas intermingled with lands managed by the Interior Department (especially the 
Bureau of Land Management).</P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>USDA Forest Service has no equivalent program; see State and Volunteer 
  Fire Assistance above. 
  <LI>For US Department of the Interior $10 million.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Forest Health Management</P></B>
<P>Provides forest health technical and financial assistance to all Federal 
agencies, Tribal governments, and States in carrying out a coordinated 
nationwide program of detecting, monitoring, evaluating, preventing and 
suppressing invasive forest insects and diseases.</P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $75 million, including funding for the 
  management and control of invasive species as a result of the fires and are 
  based on estimates of detection, evaluation, and high priority management and 
  control treatments. 
  <LI>US Department of the Interior has no equivalent program.</LI></UL></FONT><B>
<P>Economic Action Program</P></B>
<P>Provides technical and financial assistance to address the long-term health 
of rural areas, by helping communities develop opportunities and enterprises 
through diversified uses of forest resources. </P>
<UL><FONT face=TIMES>
  <LI>For the USDA Forest Service $30 million, including funding for rural 
  community assistance, forest products conservation and recycling, and market 
  development and expansion. 
  <LI>US Department of the Interior has no equivalent 
program.</LI></UL></FONT><B><FONT size=5>
