<H1>Executive Summary</H1></CENTER><I><B>Doors to Democracy</B></I> is a report 
on the current status of transparency and public participation in environmental 
matters in Europe. It is based on an examination of both laws and actual 
practices in 31 European countries, using a common questionnaire.
<P><I>Doors to Democracy</I> shows that although Europe is moving slowly in the 
direction of more participatory forms of democracy, major problems still exist 
in each of the main regions. Whereas Central and Eastern European countries tend 
to have constitutional provisions protecting rights to information, 
participation and justice, development of specific detailed laws capable of 
delivering these rights in practice is quite limited. In Western Europe, 
specific laws setting down concrete procedures are more developed, especially in 
the field of information, but there are large variations within the region. 
There is room for improvement in public participation laws and practices in all 
European countries.
<P>Laws alone are not sufficient to create a truly participatory democracy. 
Cultural changes are needed, especially in countries with deeply entrenched 
customs based on official secrecy. Countries with a thriving NGO sector find 
that public participation is enhanced and better informed.
<P>
<H2>The Right to Information</H2>
<UL type=DISC>
  <LI>Most European countries now apply the right of access to information to 
  <B>any natural or legal person</B>, without their having to prove an interest 
  and irrespective of nationality, citizenship or domicile. However, a few 
  countries still fail to apply the "any person" principle.
  <P></P>
  <LI>In countries not having general freedom of information laws, <B>narrow 
  definitions of environmental information</B> can prevent public access to some 
  important environment-related information (e.g. relating to human health, 
  GMOs, energy, economic analysis related to environmental decisionmaking, 
  policies, programs and plans).
  <P></P>
  <LI>In both East and West, broadly defined <B>exempt categories of 
  information</B> give excessive discretion to public authorities to withhold 
  information without good reason ("state secrets" or "official secrets" in NIS 
  and CEE; "internal communications," "confidential proceedings of public 
  authorities"or "voluntarily supplied information" in the West; commercial 
  confidentiality everywhere). The requirement of a <B>public interest test</B>, 
  to be applied if information is to be withheld, is emerging as a good practice 
  in some countries.
  <P></P>
  <LI>There is considerable variation in <B>time limits</B> on providing 
  information, ranging from a few days up to two months and more. Failure to 
  respond at all is also a problem.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Excessive charges</B> for information tend to be more of a problem in 
  Western countries than in CEE or NIS countries, even though paradoxically it 
  tends to be Western countries that have rules to prevent over-charging. In NIS 
  and some CEE countries, the lack of availability of copying equipment can 
  often be a greater problem than high charges.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Despite the dramatically improved efficiency and reduced costs which can 
  result from providing information in <B>electronic form</B>, none of the 
  countries studied make it obligatory for public authorities to provide 
  information in this form when requested or to put certain types of information 
  on the Internet, though this is emerging as a good practice in a number of 
  countries.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Countries do not generally require the <B>private sector</B> to provide 
  information directly to the public except in respect of major hazards or 
  pollution incidents. There are considerable differences between countries in 
  the mechanisms whereby the private sector is obliged to supply information to 
  public authorities. The prevailing climate in favor of deregulation of 
  industry has led to over-reliance on a voluntary approach. The introduction of 
  mandatory <B>pollutant release and transfer registers</B>, a powerful tool for 
  gathering information on potential polluters and putting it into the public 
  domain, is at an early stage in Europe when compared for example to the US.
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<H2>The Right to Participation</H2>
<UL type=DISC>
  <LI>Public participation in the preparation of <B>laws and regulations</B> 
  occurs in the parliamentary phase only to a very limited extent (e.g. through 
  hearings involving representative NGOs). During the executive phase there is 
  slightly more scope for participation, but some of the essential elements are 
  missing (e.g. draft regulations are not publicly available in many countries). 
  A few countries (e.g. Hungary) have quite extensive participation 
  possibilities for NGOs, showing what is possible given the political will.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Public participation in the preparation of <B>policies, programs and 
  plans</B> is provided for to some extent in most Western and CEE countries, 
  but much less so in the NIS countries. Some interesting models of partnerships 
  between NGOs and public authorities have emerged in some CEE and Western 
  countries, but substantial improvements are needed in most countries.
  <P></P>
  <LI>A significant number of countries are now using <B>Strategic Environmental 
  Assessment</B> (SEA), involving public participation as a tool in the 
  development of policies, programs and plans, and a few are using it in the 
  context of developing legislation, though overall its use in the ECE region is 
  still quite limited.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Provisions for public participation in <B>Environmental Impact 
  Assessment</B> (EIA) of projects in NIS countries are extremely inadequate and 
  urgently need upgrading. Western and CEE countries provide for participation 
  at the stage of reviewing EIA documentation, but in virtually all countries of 
  the ECE region there is a lack of public participation in the crucial scoping 
  phase of EIA.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Public participation in <B>licensing or permitting</B> of specific 
  activities is quite limited in most countries, and especially in the NIS 
  region, with participation often limited to the "affected" public and 
  inadequate mechanisms to ensure that comments are seriously taken into 
account.
  <P></P>
  <LI>A small but significant number of countries provide for <B>referenda</B> 
  and the <B>right of legislative initiative</B> as means of involving the 
  public directly as decisionmakers.
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<H2>The Right to Justice</H2>
<UL type=DISC>
  <LI>The scope for the public to directly enforce environmental laws through 
  <B>citizen suits</B> is very limited in Europe, though a few countries are 
  taking steps in that direction, e.g. by granting standing to environmental 
  NGOs.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Restrictive <B>standing</B> rules are one of the major factors limiting 
  the degree of access to justice. The trends are toward more open standing in 
  certain administrative proceedings, especially those relating to access to 
  information, and special standing for NGOs in specific procedures.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Costs</B> are a significant barrier to access to justice in many 
  countries, especially in the NIS region. In some countries, NGOs and citizens 
  are exempt from paying court fees when taking cases to protect health.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Difficulty in obtaining <B>injunctive relief</B> is one of the major 
  stumbling blocks to achieving access to justice in environmental matters.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Low cost accessible <B>administrative or quasi-judicial appeals 
  mechanisms</B> (e.g.the ombudsperson facility found in Scandinavian and other 
  countries) can provide swift and flexible resolution of disputes as well as 
  reducing the burden on the courts.
