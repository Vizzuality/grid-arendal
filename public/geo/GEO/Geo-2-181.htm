<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>Since 1994, when the first edition of this <EM>Special Reference Brief</EM> 
was compiled, "sustainability" has become a more familiar term. The goal of 
achieving a sustainable planet, one that will accommodate the basic needs of its 
present inhabitants while preserving the resources that will enable future 
generations to flourish, has gained increasing acceptance. Although certainly 
not mainstream at this point, sustainable agriculture is now being addressed by 
the agricultural community in significant ways. The mid- to late-nineties have 
seen: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Acceptance of Biodiversity and Climate Change Conventions as international 
  law, ratified by over 120 countries (1992-1999) 
  <LI>Establishment of the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development 
  and its Task Force on Sustainable Agriculture (1993) 
  <LI>Presentation for comment and unprecedented consumer response to U.S. 
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) Proposed Standards for Organic Food 
  Production (1997-1998) 
  <LI>Enactment of the U.S. Food Quality Protection Act (1997) 
  <LI>Celebration of 10 successful years of USDA's Sustainable Agriculture 
  Research and Education (SARE) program (1998) </LI></UL>
<P>In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Glickman issued a Memorandum on 
USDA sustainable agriculture policy. It stated, "USDA is committed to working 
toward the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of diverse food, 
fiber, agriculture, forest, and range systems. USDA will balance goals of 
improved production and profitability, stewardship of the natural resource base 
and ecological systems, and enhancement of the vitality of rural communities. 
USDA will integrate these goals into its policies and programs, particularly 
through interagency collaboration, partnerships and outreach." [<EM>Secretary's 
Memorandum 9500-6: Sustainable Development</EM> (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Office of the Secretary, Sept. 13, 1996), USDA Website (7/99): <A 
href="http://www.usda.gov/agency/oce/oce/sustainable-development/secmemo.htm">http://www.usda.gov/agency/oce/oce/sustainable-development/secmemo.htm</A>]</P>
<P>If advocating the need for a sustainable agriculture has become universal, 
agreement as to what is required to achieve it has not. As more parties sign on 
to the sustainable agriculture effort, perceptions about what defines 
sustainability in agriculture have multiplied. This paper strives to illustrate 
the commonality and some of the controversy that defining such a goal entails, 
and it includes brief descriptions of the methodologies and practices currently 
associated with sustainable agriculture.</P>

Information Center (AFSIC); Jane Gates, its present Coordinator; Andy Clark,

<H1>The Basics</H1>
<P>Some terms defy definition. "Sustainable agriculture" has become one of them. 
In such a quickly changing world, can anything be sustainable? What do we want 
to sustain? How can we implement such a nebulous goal? Is it too late? With the 
contradictions and questions have come a hard look at our present food 
production system and thoughtful evaluations of its future. If nothing else, the 
term "sustainable agriculture" has provided "talking points," a sense of 
direction, and an urgency, that has sparked much excitement and innovative 
thinking in the agricultural world.</P>
<P>The word "sustain," from the Latin <EM>sustinere </EM>(<EM>sus</EM>-, from 
below and <EM>tenere</EM>, to hold), to keep in existence or maintain, implies 
long-term support or permanence. As it pertains to agriculture, sustainable 
describes farming systems that are "capable of maintaining their productivity 
and usefulness to society indefinitely. Such systems... must be 
resource-conserving, socially supportive, commercially competitive, and 
environmentally sound." [John Ikerd, as quoted by Richard Duesterhaus in 
"Sustainability's Promise," <EM>Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 
</EM>(Jan.-Feb. 1990) 45(1): p.4. NAL Call # 56.8 J822]</P>
<P>"Sustainable agriculture" was addressed by Congress in the 1990 "Farm Bill" 
[Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (FACTA), Public Law 
101-624, Title XVI, Subtitle A, Section 1603 (Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC, 1990) NAL Call # KF1692.A31 1990]. Under that law, "the term 
sustainable agriculture means an integrated system of plant and animal 
production practices having a site-specific application that will, over the long 
term:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>satisfy human food and fiber needs 
  <LI>enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the 
  agricultural economy depends 
  <LI>make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm 
  resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and 
  controls 
  <LI>sustain the economic viability of farm operations 
  <LI>enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole." </LI></UL>

<H1>Some Background</H1>
<P>How have we come to reconsider our food and fiber production in terms of 
sustainability? What are the ecological, economic, social and philosophical 
issues that sustainable agriculture addresses?</P>
<P>The long-term viability of our current food production system is being 
questioned for many reasons. The news media regularly present us with the 
paradox of starvation amidst plenty-including pictures of hungry children 
juxtaposed with supermarket ads. Possible adverse environmental impacts of 
agriculture and increased incidence of foodborne illness also demand our 
attention. "Farm crises" seem to recur with regularity.</P>
<P>The prevailing agricultural system, variously called "conventional farming," 
"modern agriculture," or "industrial farming" has delivered tremendous gains in 
productivity and efficiency. Food production worldwide has risen in the past 50 
years; the World Bank estimates that between 70 percent and 90 percent of the 
recent increases in food production are the result of conventional agriculture 
rather than greater acreage under cultivation. U.S. consumers have come to 
expect abundant and inexpensive food.</P>
<P>Conventional farming systems vary from farm to farm and from country to 
country. However, they share many characteristics: rapid technological 
innovation; large capital investments in order to apply production and 
management technology; large-scale farms; single crops/row crops grown 
continuously over many seasons; uniform high-yield hybrid crops; extensive use 
of pesticides, fertilizers, and external energy inputs; high labor efficiency; 
and dependency on agribusiness. In the case of livestock, most production comes 
from confined, concentrated systems.</P>
<P>Philosophical underpinnings of industrial agriculture include assumptions 
that "a) nature is a competitor to be overcome; b) progress requires unending 
evolution of larger farms and depopulation of farm communities; c) progress is 
measured primarily by increased material consumption; d) efficiency is measured 
by looking at the bottom line; and e) science is an unbiased enterprise driven 
by natural forces to produce social good." [Karl N. Stauber et al., "The Promise 
of Sustainable Agriculture," in <EM>Planting the Future: Developing an 
Agriculture that Sustains Land and Community</EM>, Elizabeth Ann R. Bird, Gordon 
L. Bultena, and John C. Gardner, editors (Ames: Iowa State University Press, 
1995) p.13 NAL Call #: S441 P58 1995]</P>
<P>Significant negative consequences have come with the bounty associated with 
industrial farming. Concerns about contemporary agriculture are presented below. 
They are drawn from the resources compiled at the end of this chapter. While 
considering these concerns, keep the following in mind: a) interactions between 
farming systems and soil, water, biota, and atmosphere are complex--we have much 
to learn about their dynamics and long term impacts; b) most environmental 
problems are intertwined with economic, social, and political forces external to 
agriculture; c) some problems are global in scope while others are experienced 
only locally; d) many of these problems are being addressed through 
conventional, as well as alternative, agricultural channels; e) the list is not

<P>Agriculture profoundly affects many ecological systems. Negative effects of 
current practices include the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Decline in soil productivity can be due to wind and water erosion of 
  exposed topsoil; soil compaction; loss of soil organic matter, water holding 
  capacity, and biological activity; and salinization of soils and irrigation 
  water in irrigated farming areas. Desertification due to overgrazing is a 
  growing problem, especially in parts of Africa. </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Agriculture is the largest single non-point source of water pollutants 
  including sediments, salts, fertilizers (nitrates and phosphorus), pesticides, 
  and manures. Pesticides from every chemical class have been detected in 
  groundwater and are commonly found in groundwater beneath agricultural areas; 
  they are widespread in the nation's surface waters. Eutrophication and "dead 
  zones" due to nutrient runoff affect many rivers, lakes, and oceans. Reduced 
  water quality impacts agricultural production, drinking water supplies, and 
  fishery production. 
  <LI>Water scarcity in many places is due to overuse of surface and ground 
  water for irrigation with little concern for the natural cycle that maintains 
  stable water availability. 
  <LI>Other environmental ills include over 400 insects and mite pests and more 
  than 70 fungal pathogens that have become resistant to one or more pesticides; 
  stresses on pollinator and other beneficial species through pesticide use; 
  loss of wetlands and wildlife habitat; and reduced genetic diversity due to 
  reliance on genetic uniformity in most crops and livestock breeds. 
  <LI>Agriculture's link to global climate change is just beginning to be 
  appreciated. Destruction of tropical forests and other native vegetation for 
  agricultural production has a role in elevated levels of carbon dioxide and 
  other greenhouse gases. Recent studies have found that soils may be sources or 
  sinks for greenhouse gases. </LI></UL>
<H2><EM><A name=toc3b>Economic and Social Concerns</A></EM></H2>
<P>Economic and social problems associated with agriculture can not be separated 
from external economic and social pressures. As barriers to a sustainable and 
equitable food supply system, however, the problems may be described in the 
following way:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Economically, the U.S. agricultural sector includes a history of 
  increasingly large federal expenditures and corresponding government 
  involvement in planting and investment decisions; widening disparity among 
  farmer incomes; and escalating concentration of agribusiness--industries 
  involved with manufacture, processing, and distribution of farm products--into 
  fewer and fewer hands. Market competition is limited. Farmers have little 
  control over farm prices, and they continue to receive a smaller and smaller 
  portion of consumer dollars spent on agricultural products. 
  <LI>Economic pressures have led to a tremendous loss of farms, particularly 
  small farms, and farmers during the past few decades--more than 155,000 farms 
  were lost from 1987 to 1997. This contributes to the disintegration of rural 
  communities and localized marketing systems. Economically, it is very 
  difficult for potential farmers to enter the business today. Productive 
  farmland also has been pressured by urban and suburban sprawl--since 1970, 
  over 30 million acres have been lost to development. </LI></UL>
<H2><EM><A name=toc3c>Impacts on Human Health</A></EM></H2>
<P>Potential health hazards are tied to sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in 
animal production, and pesticide and nitrate contamination of water and food. 
Farm workers are poisoned in fields, toxic residues are found on foods, and 
certain human and animal diseases have developed resistance to currently used 
antibiotics.</P>
<H2><EM><A name=toc3d>Philosophical Considerations</A></EM></H2>
<P>Historically, farming played an important role in our development and 
identity as a nation. From strongly agrarian roots, we have evolved into a 
culture with few farmers. Less than two percent of Americans now produce food 
for all U.S. citizens. Can sustainable and equitable food production be 
established when most consumers have so little connection to the natural 
processes that produce their food? What intrinsically American values have 
changed and will change with the decline of rural life and farmland 
ownership?</P>
<P>World population continues to grow. According to recent United Nations 
population projections, the world population will grow from 5.7 billion in 1995 
to 9.4 billion in 2050, 10.4 billion in 2100, and 10.8 billion by 2150, and will 
stabilize at slightly under 11 billion around 2200. The rate of population 
increase is especially high in many developing countries. In these countries, 
the population factor, combined with rapid industrialization, poverty, political 
instability, and large food imports and debt burden, make long-term food 
security especially urgent.</P>
<P>Finally, the challenge of defining and dealing with the problems associated 
with today's food production system is inherently laden with controversy and 
emotion. "It is unfortunate, but true, that many in the agriculture community 
view sustainable agriculture as a personal criticism, or an attack, on 
conventional agriculture of which they are justifiably proud. 'I guess that the 
main thing people get defensive about when you say sustainable,' explained one 
agent, 'is that it implies that what they've been doing is not sustainable. And 
that's the biggest issue.'" [Judy Green, "Sustainable Agriculture: Why Green 
Ideas Raise a Red Flag," <EM>Farming Alternatives Newsletter [Cornell]</EM>

<H1>A Sampling of Perspectives</H1>
<P>"It's easy to understand why key individuals and organizations in agriculture 
have flocked to this term. After all, who would advocate a 'non-sustainable 
agriculture?'" [Charles A. Francis, "Sustainable Agriculture: Myths and 
Realities," <EM>Journal of Sustainable Agriculture</EM> (1990) 1(1): p.97. NAL 
Call # S494.5.S86S8] Despite the appeal of a sustainable agriculture philosophy, 
however, discussions about how best to define and achieve sustainability present 
some controversy. Supporters of sustainable agriculture come from diverse 
backgrounds, academic disciplines, and farming practices. Their convictions as 
to what elements are acceptable or not acceptable in a sustainable farming 
system sometimes conflict. They also disagree on whether sustainable agriculture 
needs defining at all.</P>
<P>"Sustainable agriculture is a philosophy based on human goals and on 
understanding the long-term impact of our activities on the environment and on 
other species. Use of this philosophy guides our application of prior experience 
and the latest scientific advances to create integrated, resource-conserving, 
equitable farming systems. These systems reduce environmental degradation, 
maintain agricultural productivity, promote economic viability in both the short 
and long term, and maintain stable rural communities and quality of life." 
[Charles Francis and Garth Youngberg, "Sustainable Agriculture - An Overview," 
in <EM>Sustainable Agriculture in Temperate Zones</EM>, edited by CA Francis, CB 
Flora and LD King (New York: Wiley, 1990), p.8. NAL Call # S494.5.S86S87]</P>
<P>"Sustainable agriculture does not mean a return to either the low yields or 
poor farmers that characterized the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. Rather, 
sustainability builds on current agricultural achievements, adopting a 
sophisticated approach that can maintain high yields and farm profits without 
undermining the resources on which agriculture depends." ["Frequently Asked 
Questions About Sustainable Agriculture," in <EM>Sustainable Agriculture--A New 
Vision</EM> (Union of Concerned Scientists, 1999). Available at UCS Website 
(7/99): <A 
href="http://www.ucsusa.org/agriculture/sus.ag.faqs.html">http://www.ucsusa.org/agriculture/sus.ag.faqs.html</A>]</P>
<P>"A systems approach is essential to understanding sustainability. The system 
is envisioned in its broadest sense, from the individual farm, to the local 
ecosystem, and to communities affected by this farming system both locally and 
globally...A systems approach gives us the tools to explore the interconnections 
between farming and other aspects of our environment". [University of California 
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP), <EM>What is 
Sustainable Agriculture?</EM> (SAREP, 1998). Available at SAREP Website (7/99): 
<A 
href="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm</A>]</P>
<P>"Environmental sustainability implies the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>meeting the basic needs of all peoples, and giving this priority over 
  meeting the greeds of a few 
  <LI>keeping population densities, if possible, below the carrying capacity of 
  the region 
  <LI>adjusting consumption patterns and the design and management of systems to 
  permit the renewal of renewable resources 
  <LI>conserving, recycling, and establishing priorities for the use of 
  nonrenewable resources 
  <LI>keeping environmental impact below the level required to allow the systems 
  affected to recover and continue to evolve. </LI></UL>
<P>"An environmentally sustainable agriculture is one that is compatible with 
and supportive of the above criteria." [Stuart B. Hill, "Environmental 
Sustainability and the Redesign of Agroecosystems" (Ecological Agriculture 
Projects/McGill University, 1992). Available at EAP Website (7/99): <A 
href="http://eap.mcgill.ca/Publications/EAP34.htm">http://eap.mcgill.ca/Publications/EAP34.htm</A>]</P>
<P>Dr. Hill goes on to explain: "To help recognize these real issues I 
distinguish between shallow (short-term, symbolic) and deep (long-term, 
fundamental) sustainability. Shallow sustainability focuses on efficiency and 
substitution strategies with respect to the use of resources. It usually accepts 
the predominant goals within society without question, and aims to solve 
problems by means of curative solution. Deep sustainability, in contrast, 
re-evaluates goals in relation to higher values and redesigns the systems 
involved in achieving these goals to that this can be done within ecological 
limits." [Ibid]</P>
<P>Sustainable agriculture is "a way of practicing agriculture which seeks to 
optimize skills and technology to achieve long-term stability of the 
agricultural enterprise, environmental protection, and consumer safety. It is 
achieved through management strategies which help the producer select hybrids 
and varieties, soil conserving cultural practices, soil fertility programs, and 
pest management programs. The goal of sustainable agriculture is to minimize 
adverse impacts to the immediate and off-farm environments while providing a 
sustained level of production and profit. Sound resource conservation is an 
integral part of the means to achieve sustainable agriculture." [<EM>USDA 
Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) General Manual</EM> (180-GM, Part 
407). Available at NRCS Website (7/99): <A 
href="http://public.nrcs.usda.gov/national/gm/title180/part407/subparta/index.htm">http://public.nrcs.usda.gov/national/gm/title180/part407/subparta/index.htm</A>]</P>
<P>"Today, sustainable farming practices commonly include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>crop rotations that mitigate weeds, disease, insect and other pest 
  problems; provide alternative sources of soil nitrogen; reduce soil erosion; 
  and reduce risk of water contamination by agricultural chemicals 
  <LI>pest control strategies that are not harmful to natural systems, farmers, 
  their neighbors, or consumers. This includes integrated pest management 
  techniques that reduce the need for pesticides by practices such as scouting, 
  use of resistant cultivars, timing of planting, and biological pest controls 
  <LI>increased mechanical/biological weed control; more soil and water 
  conservation practices; and strategic use of animal and green manures 
  <LI>use of natural or synthetic inputs in a way that poses no significant 
  hazard to man, animals, or the environment. </LI></UL>
<P>"This approach encompasses the whole farm, relying on the expertise of 
farmers, interdisciplinary teams of scientists, and specialists from the public 
and private sectors." [Paul F. O'Connell, "Sustainable Agriculture, a Valid 
Alternative," <EM>Outlook on Agriculture</EM> (1992) 21(1): p.6. NAL Call # 10 
Ou8]</P>
<UL>
  <LI>"Sustainable agriculture is a model of social and economic organization 
  based on an equitable and participatory vision of development which recognizes 
  the environment and natural resources as the foundation of economic activity. 
  Agriculture is sustainable when it is ecologically sound, economically viable, 
  socially just, culturally appropriate and based on a holistic scientific 
  approach. 
  <LI>"Sustainable agriculture preserves biodiversity, maintains soil fertility 
  and water purity, conserves and improves the chemical, physical and biological 
  qualities of the soil, recycles natural resources and conserves energy. 
  Sustainable agriculture produces diverse forms of high quality foods, fibers 
  and medicines. 
  <LI>"Sustainable agriculture uses locally available renewable resources, 
  appropriate and affordable technologies and minimizes the use of external and 
  purchased inputs, thereby increasing local independence and self sufficiency 
  and insuring a source of stable income for peasants, family and small farmers 
  and rural communities. This allows more people to stay on the land, 
  strengthens rural communities and integrates humans with their environment. 
  <LI>"Sustainable agriculture respects the ecological principles of diversity 
  and interdependence and uses the insights of modern science to improve rather 
  than displace the traditional wisdom accumulated over centuries by innumerable 
  farmers around the world." [These excerpts are from <EM>NGO Sustainable 
  Agriculture Treaty</EM>, Global Forum at Rio de Janeiro, June 1-15, 1992.

  </LI></UL>
<P>"Sustainable agriculture does not refer to a prescribed set of practices. 
Instead, it challenges producers to think about the long-term implications of 
practices and the broad interactions and dynamics of agricultural systems. It 
also invites consumers to get more involved in agriculture by learning more 
about and becoming active participants in their food systems. A key goal is to 
understand agriculture from an ecological perspective--in terms of nutrient and 
energy dynamics, and interactions among plants, animals, insects and other 
organisms in agroecosystems --then balance it with profit, community and 
consumer needs." [Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE<EM>),

<P>"Consumers can play a critical role in creating a sustainable food system. 
Through their purchases, they send strong messages to producers, retailers and 
others in the system about what they think is important. Food cost and 
nutritional quality have always influenced consumer choices. The challenge now 
is to find strategies that broaden consumer perspectives, so that environmental 
quality, resource use, and social equity issues are also considered in shopping 
decisions. At the same time, new policies and institution must be created to 
enable producers using sustainable practices to market their goods to a wider

<P>"...I think the community has reached about as explicit, useful, concrete a 
definition of sus ag [sic] as now possible, or possible at any given time, given 
the differences of opinion, world view, etc., that exist. At any point in time, 
in any society, the definition of any concept like sus ag is going to be a 
compromise among differing world views, sets of values, etc. no one of which has 
any way to prove the other wrong, or illegitimate. So the sus ag tent is now 
relatively stable; its shape and innards perhaps fully pleasing to no one, but I 
am certain there is no real point in debating the fine points anymore because we 
will simply document more crisply the differences that are out there, and have 
been all along....One of the other realities is that the 'definition' of 
something like sus ag is going to remain fluid, driven by changes in politics, 
idealogy, science, community values, etc." [Charles Benbrook, <EM>More Soil

<P>"I concluded some time ago that we didn't need to spend much more time and 
effort attempting to define sustainability. We have sufficient commonality among 
our different understandings of it to continue moving in the right general 
direction, even if we are not yet all moving toward precisely the same 
destination by the same route. More recently, I have come to the conclusion that 
we may never have a generally accepted definition of sustainability, and 
perhaps, we don't need one." [John Ikerd, <EM>On Not Defining 
Sustainability...</EM> (Sanet-mg post, May 1998). Available at Sanet-mg Archives

<P>"'Sustainability' is at once extremely important and practically useless. It 
consists of a set of concepts which are fundamentally different in nature. That 
is why there has been no success in attempt to identify THE definition of 
sustainability. There can be no satisfactory definition which is not 
multifaceted. This poses serious difficulties for the practical application of 
sustainability as an objective in real decision making. We have suggested here 
that these difficulties be addressed by focussing on the particular aspects of 
sustainability which the decision maker considers to be important, and 
presenting information about the trade offs between these aspects within a 
multiple criteria decision making formula." [David J. Pannell and Steven 
Schilizzi, "Sustainable Agriculture: A Matter of Ecology, Equity, Economic 
Efficiency or Experience?" <EM>Journal of Sustainable Agriculture</EM> (1999)

<H1>The Future of the Sustainable Agriculture Concept</H1>
<P>Many in the agricultural community have adopted the sense of urgency and 
direction pointed to by the sustainable agriculture concept. Lack of sharp 
definition has not lessened its authenticity. Sustainability has become an 
integral component of many government, commercial, and non-profit agriculture 
research efforts, and it is beginning to be woven into agricultural policy. 
Increasing numbers of farmers and ranchers have embarked on their own paths to 
sustainability, incorporating integrated and innovative approaches into their 
own enterprises.</P>
<P>This just-do-it attitude is the real force carrying the issue of 
sustainability into the next century. "The best way to communicate the meaning 
of sustainable agriculture is through real-life stories of farmers who are 
developing sustainable farming systems on their own farms," says John Ikerd, 
describing the original <EM>1,000 Ways to Sustainable Farming</EM> project 
funded by USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program. The 
project sought "to explore and refine the definition of sustainable agriculture 
by profiling successful sustainable farmers and ranchers." SARE continued the 
project, renaming it <EM>The New American Farmer</EM> [<A 
href="http://www.sare.org/newfarmer/">http://www.sare.org/newfarmer/</A>]. "In 
addition to describing successful farming practices, the features in <EM>The New 
American Farmer</EM> detail the effects of those practices on farm 
profitability, quality of life, rural communities and the environment."</P>
<P>Critical discussion of the sustainable agriculture concept will and should 
continue. Understanding will deepen; answers will continue to come. On-going 
dialog is important for another reason: with more parties, each with its own 
agenda, jumping into the sustainable agriculture "tent," only a continued focus 
on the real issues and goals will keep sustainable agriculture from becoming so 
all-encompassing as to become meaningless.</P>
<P>Youngberg and Harwood's 1989 statement still holds true: "We are yet a long 
way from knowing just what methods and systems in diverse locations will really 
lead to sustainability... In many regions of the country, however, and for many 
crops, the particular mix of methods that will allow curtailing use of harmful 
farm chemicals or building crop diversity, while also providing economic 
success, are not yet clear. The stage is set for challenging not only farm 
practitioners, but also researchers, educators, and farm industry." [Garth 
Youngberg and Richard Harwood, "Sustainable Farming Systems: Needs and 
Opportunities," <EM>American Journal of Alternative Agriculture</EM> (1989) 4(3

<H1>Related Terms</H1>
<P>The following terms are commonly associated with sustainable agricultural 
systems. None are synonymous with sustainable agriculture; each relates to the 
concept in a different way. Most come under the umbrella of sustainable 
agriculture. A few, including biotechnology and precision farming, provoke much 
disagreement as to their appropriate use in a sustainable system. Some of the 
terms described are conceptual in nature, while others are strictly 
methodological. Many are combinations of both approaches. Several of these 
concepts and practices have very literal meanings that have been colored by 
their historic use and practitioners' experiences.</P>

<P>Agroecology can be defined broadly or narrowly. "Loosely defined, agroecology 
often incorporates ideas about a more environmentally and socially sensitive 
approach to agriculture, one that focuses not only on production, but also on 
the ecological sustainability of the productive system. [This definition] 
implies a number of features about society and production that go well beyond 
the limits of the agricultural field.</P>
<P>At its most narrow, agroecology refers to the study of purely ecological 
phenomena within the crop field, such as predator/prey relations, or crop/weed 
competition." [Susanna B. Hecht, "The Evolution of Agroecological Thought," in

<H2><A name=term7>Biological Farming/Ecological Farming:</A></H2>
<P>Biological and Ecological Farming are terms commonly used in Europe and 
developing countries. Although sometimes strictly defined, e.g., "Biological 
farming is a system of crop production in which the producer tries to minimize 
the use of 'chemicals' for control of crop pests," [John Pesek, "Introduction," 
<EM>Proceedings of the Management Alternatives for Biological Farming 
Workshop</EM>, comp. by Robert B. Dahlgren (Ames IA: Iowa State University, 
1983) p. 1. NAL Call # S494.5.P75M35 1983] both biological farming and 
ecological farming are terms used in the broader sense, encompassing various and 
more specific practices and techniques of farming sustainability, e.g., organic, 
biodynamic, holistic, natural.</P>
<P>Norman et al. point to some differentiation between the two terms: "In Europe 
(e.g., the Netherlands), the term biological often refers to organic farming, 
whereas the term ecological refers to organic plus environmental considerations 
such as on-farm wildlife management (i.e., the relationships between parts of 
the agroecosystem." [David Norman, et al., <EM>Defining and Implementing

<H2><A name=term8>Biotechnology:</A></H2>
<P>Although farmers have been practicing biotechnology in the broadest sense 
(i.e. plant and animal breeding to achieve certain traits) for thousands of 
years, it is the recent breaking of the genetic code that has pushed this 
science into a new era altogether. <STRONG>Genetic engineering</STRONG> differs 
significantly from traditional biotechnological techniques in that DNA from 
different species can be combined to create completely new organisms 
(Genetically Modified Organisms - GMOs). [Burkhard Mausberg and Maureen

<P>Whether this technology is compatible with sustainable agriculture, and if 
so, in what ways, provokes much controversy among sustainable agriculture 
advocates. Products such as plants engineered for herbicide tolerance or insect 
resistance, and bacteria engineered to produce drugs for livestock may point to 
reduced chemical use and other sustainable applications. But what are the 
risks?</P>
<P>The Union of Concerned Scientists' list of potential risks related to GMOs 
include those to human health--new allergens in the food supply, antibiotic 
resistance, production of new toxins, concentration of toxic metals, enhancement 
of the environment for toxic fungi; and those to the environment--gene transfer 
to wild or weedy relatives and increased weediness, change in herbicide use 
patterns, squandering of valuable pest susceptibility genes, poisoned wildlife, 
creation of new or worse viruses, and other, so far, unknown harms. [<EM>Shaping

<H2><A name=term9>Carrying Capacity:</A></H2>
<P>Carrying capacity is the theoretical equilibrium population size at which a 
particular population in a particular environment will stabilize when its supply 
of resources remains constant. It can also be considered to be the maximum 
sustainable population size; the maximum size that can be supported indefinitely 
into the future without degrading the environment for future generations.

<P>"The Earth's capacity to support people is determined both by natural 
constraints and by human choices concerning economics, environment, culture 
(including values and politics) and demography. Human carrying capacity is 
therefore dynamic and uncertain. Human choice is not captured by ecological 
notions of carrying capacity that are appropriate for nonhuman populations. 
Simple mathematical models of the relations between human population growth and 
human carrying capacity can account for faster-than-exponential population 
growth followed by a slowing population growth rate, as observed in recent human 
history." Joel E. Cohen, <EM>Population Growth and Earth's Human Carrying

<P>Conservation Tillage is a term that covers a broad range of soil tillage 
systems that leave residue cover on the soil surface, substantially reducing the 
effects of soil erosion from wind and water. These practices minimize nutrient 
loss, decreased water storage capacity, crop damage, and decreased farmability. 
[<EM>Conservation Tillage: Effects on Soil Erosion</EM> (Publication AE-3050;

<P>The term is "somewhat misleading and indeed unfortunate. For some it implied 
that farmers should starve their crops, let the weeds choke them out, and let 
insects clean up what was left. In fact, the term low-input referred to 
purchasing few off-farm inputs (usually fertilizers and pesticides), while 
increasing on-farm inputs (i.e. manures, cover crops, and especially 
management). Thus, a more accurate term would be different input or low external

<P>Nature farming grew out of the philosophy and methodology of Japanese

Okada expounded it, rests on a belief in the universal life-giving powers that 
the elements of fire, water, and earth confer on the soil... The planet's soil, 
created over a span of eons, has acquired life-sustaining properties, in 
accordance with the principle of the indivisibility of the spiritual and the 
physical realms, which in turn provide the life-force that enables plants to 
grow. To utilize the inherent power of the soil is the underlying principle of 
Nature Farming." [Mokicho Okada Association, "The Fundamentals of MOA Nature

<P>Nutrient management has taken on new connotations in recent times. Soil 
fertility traditionally dealt with supplying and managing nutrients to meet crop 
production requirements, focusing on optimization of agronomic production and 
economic returns to crop production. Contemporary nutrient management deals with 
these same production concerns, but recognizes that ways of farming must now 
balance the limits of soil and crop nutrient use with the demands of intensive 
animal production. Current decision-making processes include crop and animal 
production factors, economic factors, and the integrity of local surface water 
and groundwater, as well as the fate of far-away environmental systems. [From:

<H2><A name=term23>Organic Farming:</A></H2>
<P>The term 'organic farming' was first used by Lord Northbourne in the book, 
<EM>Look to the Land</EM> (London: Dent, 1940. NAL Call # 30 N81). Lord 
Northbourne, who embraced the teachings of Rudolph Steiner and biodynamic 
farming, had a "vision of the farm as a sustainable, ecologically stable, 
self-contained unit, biologically complete and balanced--a dynamic living 
organic whole...The term thus did not refer solely to the use of living 
materials (organic manures, etc) in agriculture although obviously it included 
them, but with its emphasis on 'wholeness' is encompassed best by the definition 
'of, pertaining to, or characterized by systematic connexion or coordination of 
parts of the one whole.' (Oxford English Dictionary, 1971.)" [AM Scofield, 
"Editorial: Organic Farming--The Origin of the Name," <EM>Biological Agriculture 
and Horticulture</EM> (1986) 4: pp.1-5. NAL Call # S605.5 B5] Organic farming 
was championed in this country by JI Rodale, beginning in the mid-1940s.</P>
<P>As defined by a USDA Study Team on Organic Farming, "Organic farming is a 
production system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetically 
compounded fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, and livestock feed 
additives. To the maximum extent feasible, organic farming systems rely upon 
crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off-farm 
organic wastes, mechanical cultivation, mineral-bearing rocks, and aspects of 
biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and tilth, to supply plant 
nutrients, and to control insects, weeds and other pests." [<EM>Report and 
Recommendations on Organic Farming</EM> (Washington DC: USDA, 1980), p. xii. NAL 
Call # aS605.5 U52]</P>
<P>The following definition was drafted and passed by the USDA National Organic 
Standards Board (NOSB) in April 1995. It was developed by a joint NOSB/National 
Organic Program task force, and incorporated language from the Codex Draft 
Guidelines for organically produced foods: "Organic agriculture is an ecological 
production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological 
cycles and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm 
inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological 
harmony. 'Organic' is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the 
authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. </P>
<P>"The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and 
practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that 
integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole. Organic 
agriculture practices cannot ensure that products are completely free of 
residues; however, methods are used to minimize pollution from air, soil and 
water. Organic food handlers, processors and retailers adhere to standards that 
maintain the integrity of organic agricultural products. The primary goal of 
organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent 
communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." [<EM>NOSB

Program (NOP)). Available at NOP Website (7/99): <A

<P>Currently, many states have instituted their own regulations and/or 
certifying process for the labeling of organic products. Most organic 
certification is performed by private organizations. The 1990 Farm Bill mandated 
national standards; the USDA and the National Organic Standards Board are still 
(1999) working on this goal.</P>
<H2><A name=term24>Permaculture:</A></H2>
<P>A contraction of "permanent agriculture," the word "permaculture" was coined 
by Australian Bill Mollison in the late 1970s. One of the many alternative 
agriculture systems described as sustainable, permaculture is "unique in its 
emphasis on design; that is, the location of each element in a landscape, and 
the evolution of landscape over time. The goal of permaculture is to produce an 
efficient, low-maintenance integration of plants, animals, people and 
structure... applied at the scale of a home garden, all the way through to a

<P>Precision agriculture is a "management strategy that employs detailed,

sometimes called <STRONG>Precision Agriculture</STRONG>,<STRONG> Prescription 
Farming</STRONG>, <STRONG>Site-specific Management</STRONG>. The idea is to know 
the soil and crop characteristics unique to each part of the field, and to 
optimize the production inputs within small portions of the field. The 
philosophy behind precision agriculture is that production inputs (seed, 
fertilizer, chemicals, etc.) should be applied only as needed and where needed 
for the most economic production." [Stephen W. Searcy, "Precision Farming: A New

<H1>For Further Reading</H1>
<P>The list of books, articles, web documents, and videocassettes that follows 
is not meant to be a comprehensive compilation. Rather, it is an attempt to 
represent the range of academic fields, geographic areas, agricultural 
practices, environmental issues, and philosophies that sustainable agriculture 
touches upon. Included are 61 "Reading List" items from the 1994 edition of 
"Sustainable Agriculture: Definitions and Terms." An author index is appended. 
Internet resource sites are listed with the date (in parentheses) that the 
author accessed them.</P>
<P>Sanet-mg, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) e-mail discussion group, 
hosts dynamic discussion about the definitions, dimensions, and implications of 
a sustainable agriculture. A particularly lively and informative "give and take" 
took place during the early part of 1995. Another thread on the social and 
economic aspects of sustainability in agriculture occurred during the Summer of 
1999. To read relevant messages, go to the sanet-mg archives directly (<A 
href="http://www.sare.org/">http://www.sare.org/</A>, click on SANET-MG and 
scroll to the time period that interests you) and follow the discussions 
chronologically. Users may also search the archives, via the search engine, by 
keyword (try "definitions" or "defining") or by sender name.</P>
