<P align=center>BAS Ozone Bulletin 01/00</P></FONT><FONT face=Arial>
<P align=justify><BR>The 2000 ozone hole has shrunk a little, but still covers 
around 24 million square kilometres. At its largest it reached 28.4 million 
square kilometres in early September and was the largest ever recorded ozone 
hole. It also formed unusually early, and it is normally late September before 
it reaches its maximum extent. Minimum ozone values are usually measured at the 
end of September or early in October. Ozone values are below 200 DU over much of 
the continent, with large areas showing below 125 DU and a few places below 100 
DU. A broad collar of ozone rich air surrounds Antarctica, with highest values 
(above 450 DU) over the Davis Sea. Ozone measurements at the BAS Halley station 
show that ozone values are dropping rapidly and are now around 120 DU (40% of 
the normal value). Measurements from the BAS Rothera station show a decline from 
around 300 DU in early June to 115 DU in early September, with variation on a 
variety of time scales superimposed upon this. The decline was rapid from late 
August until mid September, but has now bottomed out, with recent values at 
around 110 DU. Ozone measurements at the Ukrainian Vernadsky station (formerly 
the BAS Faraday station) show that ozone values dropped from around 250 DU at 
the beginning of August to around 200 DU, but then briefly recovered to near 
normal values at the end of the month. They have now dropped to around 140 DU 
(40% of the normal value). The temperature at 100 hPa, near the centre of the 
ozone layer, is near -80°C over much of the continent and the Antarctic 
stratosphere is still cold enough for Type I stratospheric clouds to form and 
persist. The coldest area is centred over the Filchner Ice Shelf. Stratospheric 
clouds have been sighted from Vernadsky, Rothera and Halley. A mini ozone hole, 
with central values below 200 DU, periodically formed to the east of the 
Antarctic Peninsula over the Weddell Sea during July. This mini ozone hole 
probably formed due to processing of ozone through PSCs, which were far enough 
north to be sunlit. The feature was particularly marked on July 10 and again on 
July 20. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>Ozone values over the Arctic are normally at their lowest in 
September and this year is no exception as can be see from the TOMS images. 
Although the values are low, they are low because of stratospheric dynamics and 
not chemistry. The temperature in the Arctic ozone layer is above -55°C, far too 
warm for stratospheric clouds to form. Hence there is no chemical depletion 
taking place and no ozone hole above the Arctic.</P>

<P align=justify>Note that August and April do not have observations on every 
day, and that the routine measurement season is now longer than it was in 1957 - 
72. Measurements made at the start of the season are of lower accuracy than in 
mid summer due to the low solar elevation or use of moonlight. Gif images 
showing the data are available on the BAS ozone web-page.</P>

  <LI>Ozone. Ozone measurements from Rothera are made using a SAOZ (Systeme 
  d'Automatique Observations Zenithales) spectrometer. This research instrument 
  has a preliminary calibration such that it reads about 15% low compared to 
  Dobson measurements at 100 DU, and is in agreement at 300 DU. The lowest 
  values are around 105 DU once the 15% correction is applied to the 
  measurements given below. The mean daily total ozone values generally show a 
  similar pattern of variation to that seen at Vernadsky, though day to day 
  variation does not show such pronounced wave activity and minimum values are a 
  little lower.

<P align=justify><BR>TOVS satellite images from the US NCEP/NWS/NOAA Climate 
Prediction Center and EP/TOMS images from the US NASA/GSFC show the formation of 
the ozone hole during August and September. TOVS and TOMS currently have 
significantly different calibrations, with TOVS reading some 50 DU higher than 
TOMS. TOMS values are close to ground-based values. BAS have made a 2000/2001 
ozone hole movie from TOMS images, which is on our web page and will generally 
be updated every week. NOAA analyses show that the 50 hPa temperature has 
remained below the normal during the winter, though a rise to normal (-82 deg C) 
occurred in the second half of August. Subsequently the atmosphere cooled and 
conditions are still suitable for Type I PSC formation.</P>
<P><BR><BR>Further information is available on the BAS ozone web page, which 
contains earlier bulletins, data, graphs and general ozone information. It is 
often updated several times a week. The email ozone bulletins will be issued 
less frequently this year so for the latest information see: 
http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk/public/icd/jds/ozone</P>
<P align=justify><BR>Note that all ozone values in this bulletin are preliminary 
and are subject to revision from time to time when the instrument constants are 
re-evaluated. Final data will be archived with WOUDC, Toronto in due course, but 
preliminary data back to 1973 are available from BAS on request. All Dobson 
ozone data are reduced to the Bass-Paur scale as recommended by the WMO. The 
reference period used for the normals is 1957 - 1972. If you use or pass on data 
in this bulletin please make acknowledgement to J D Shanklin, British Antarctic 
Survey. </P>
