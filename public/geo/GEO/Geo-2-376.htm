            <P><FONT color=#006699 size=6>I</FONT><FONT size=+0>n late November 
            of 1998, the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re – the world's 
            largest reinsurer – issued a report which assessed the total losses, 
            worldwide, from storms, floods, droughts, and fires for the first 
            eleven months of that unusual year. The staggering sum, at that 
            time, was a record $89 billion: nearly 50 percent higher than the 
            previous record of $60 billion in 1996. In addition to material 
            losses, these weather-related events had taken an estimated 32,000 
            lives, while displacing 300 million people from their homes: more 
            than the populations of Canada and the United States combined. Three 
            months earlier, <I>LIFE</I> magazine had chosen "WEATHER" for its 
            cover story, noting that in the preceding year and a half, an 
            unusual run of weather-related disasters around the world had cost 
            thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars in damages. The 
            extreme weather events that the magazine described were but a 
            sampling of what was to become a staple of the daily news. And with 
            ever mounting costs.</FONT></P>

            <P>In early August, for example, major floods devastated parts of 
            Korea, and in August and September 1998, extensive monsoon-related 
            flooding struck heavily-populated eastern India and Bangladesh. 
            Widespread heavy rains in China, at about the same time, released 
            the mighty Yangtze River from its banks, with ensuing reports of 
            more than 3,000 deaths, some 230 million people homeless, and over 
            $30 billion in flood damage. In the summer of 1998 heat waves and 
            air pollution episodes plagued many regions of the world, 
            particularly in Egypt and other Mediterranean countries, and in 
            southern Europe. In New Zealand, record floods in July and October 
            1998 were the worst in 100 years. But the costliest disaster of them 
            all, in terms of human life, struck the Caribbean in late October. 
            Hurricane Mitch caused the deaths of more than 11,000 people in 
            Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, primarily through 
            the extensive flooding that followed prolonged and heavy rains.</P>
            <P>A number of extreme-weather events with large human impacts fell 
            in the same period in the United States, and most of them were 
            explained, in news reports, as the expected impacts of the 
            uncommonly strong El Niño of 1997-98. In the southeastern states, 
            tornado outbreaks, and Florida floods (costing $1 billion in damage 
            and taking at least 132 lives) were part of a pattern that led to 
            the wettest winter on record there. Torrential rains in February 
            1998 in California brought flooding to many locales, with heavy mud 
            slides and coastal erosion. A winter ice storm in early 1998 wreaked 
            havoc in New England and southeastern Canada, leaving many 
            communities without electric power for several weeks. At the same 
            time, the northern tier of states experienced one of the mildest 
            winters (1997-98) on record. Lake Erie failed to freeze for only the 
            third time on record.</P>
            <P>The spring of 1998 brought heavy flooding to Iowa, Indiana and 
            other midwest states, and to some of New England, as part of 
            generally wetter than normal conditions from Idaho to the U.S. 
            Northeast. Ohio River flooding left 30,000 people without power.</P>
            <P>Meanwhile drought enveloped the South. Extremely dry conditions 
            from April through June 1998 led to wildfires which destroyed many 
            structures, and in Florida alone, charred 485,000 acres – an area 
            that is half the size of Rhode Island. In Texas the drought hung on 
            through the summer months as well, bringing sweltering heat waves 
            that devastated agriculture in much of the state.</P>
            <P>The drought in Texas (the number one U.S. cotton producer) and 
            the wetness in the winter and spring of 1998 in California 
            (contributing to the spread of soil fungus in the second-ranked 
            cotton producing state) resulted in a U.S. cotton crop that fell 
            almost 25 percent below that of 1997. In October, another switch 
            occurred in Texas – from too little to too much rain – leaving parts 
            of Texas inundated, with twenty-two dead and reports of the worst 
            flooding since the late 1920s. In early November heavy rains 
            triggered floods in Kansas and Oklahoma.</P>
            <P>These are but a sampling of the extreme weather events that have 
            come our way in the past two or three years. Why so many, and what 
            brought them on? Can these questions be answered at all with any 
            certainty? How unusual were these extreme events, in the context of 
            "normal" weather variability or within the limits of what 
            meteorologists expect in El Niño years? Are we to anticipate more of 
            the same in years ahead, and how much need we be concerned?</P>

            <P>The authors of the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re report felt 
            certain that our own actions are in part responsible for the 
            escalating costs of weather-related disasters, through (i) a 
            combination of deforestation and land use change (which greatly 
            affect water runoff during heavy rains); (ii) the effects of growing 
            population pressures (which have led people to settle in flood plain 
            and other regions vulnerable to flooding); and (iii) our 
            energy-related impacts on climate itself. But can we tell whether 
            human activities are really contributing?</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>The broadcasts and news stories that bring weather events to our 
            attention as they happen are of necessity cursory and incomplete. 
            With more extensive data and the benefit of hindsight we can hope to 
            make more responsible assessments of what happened and why. A first 
            step is to look for the telltale marks of probable causes, to help 
            us sift out significant changes in global and regional weather from 
            the chaff of more random variations.</P>
            <P><B><I><FONT color=#006699>Two probable causes</FONT></I></B></P>
            <P>Two extremely likely suspects are potentially involved in what 
            occurred, and neither can be much of a stranger to anyone who has 
            watched or read or listened to the news: El Niño and global 
            greenhouse warming. The first and more certainly involved is the 
            1997-98 El Niño and ensuing La Niña: a recurring, one-two punch to 
            the global climate system that is driven by distinctive warming and 
            later, cooling of surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El 
            Niños – the better known of the two – are set in motion at irregular 
            intervals, altering the course of weather and climate, around the 
            world, for up to a year or so. The most recent were in 1982-83, 
            1986-87, 1990-95, and 1997-98.</P>
            <P>We know from past occurrences that what might be called a "mini 
            global warming" accompanies each El Niño, with the highest air 
            temperatures typically occurring a few months after the peak in 
            ocean surface warming. The record-breaking and long-lasting El Niño 
            of 1997-98 began in April of the first year and persisted until May 
            of the next. It almost certainly contributed in establishing 1998 as 
            the world's warmest year on record.</P>
            <P>But the exceptional nature of the 1997-98 El Niño – more intense 
            in many ways than those well documented in the past – requires an 
            explanation, and suggests that it was aided and abetted, somehow, by 
            other climate forces. Most likely implicated is the warming of the 
            Earth – quite independent of El Niño – that is expected from the 
            accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the 
            atmosphere. Did "global warming" also show its hand in the run of 
            recent weather extremes, and did it amplify what might have been a 
            more run-of-the-mill El Niño?</P>

            <P>In the early 1930s the U.S. experienced what is probably our best 
            remembered period of extreme weather events, in what came to be 
            known as the "Dust Bowl era." Extensive droughts, year after year, 
            took a particularly heavy toll on farms and farm families in the 
            bread basket of America, providing a backdrop for John Steinbeck's 
            novel, <I>The Grapes of Wrath,</I> that tells the human impacts on 
            displaced migratory farm workers. Some of the Dust Bowl years still 
            stand today, in certain localities, as the warmest on record.</P>
            <P>Record-setting temperatures or precipitation amounts, and extreme 
            events of all kinds are normal features of climate: they occur, 
            somewhere, all the time, and always will. A year in which none was 
            noted, anywhere, would indeed be noteworthy. But there seem to have 
            been an uncommon number of such extremes in the late 1990s, 
            particularly when we look at the world as a whole. Or could it be 
            the result of more thorough reporting, or the existence of 
            continuous TV news or weather channels that must find something of 
            interest to broadcast, every hour of each day?</P>
            <P>While we are indeed exposed to more and ever-wider coverage of 
            the weather, the nature of some of the records being broken suggests 
            a deeper explanation: that real changes are under way. In 
            particular, global mean temperature records – based on the average 
            of continual measurements taken at thousands of surface weather 
            stations around the world – were broken month after month in 1998, 
            and by margins never seen before.</P>
            <P>The news media, reflecting valid public concerns, usually 
            endeavor to include an explanation for dramatic weather events. 
            Their queries are commonly answered by weather forecasters in terms 
            of weather phenomena themselves: such as "the drought was caused by 
            a big stationary anticyclone sitting over the region," or "the jet 
            stream was displaced south of normal." But these are more 
            descriptions of what happened, than explanations of why.</P>

            <P>Such answers may be all that one can give, for often there is no 
            identifiable "cause," given that weather has a wide range of natural 
            variability, and is ever changing. <I>Weather systems</I> (such as 
            the large-scale rotating wind patterns called <I>cyclones</I> and 
            <I>anticyclones</I>) and <I>weather phenomena</I> (such as 
            thunderstorms) arise primarily from <I>instabilities</I> within the 
            atmosphere: where a small perturbation in the flow of air, for 
            example, is rapidly amplified. The energy that drives these 
            instabilities comes most often from the uneven way in which heat 
            from the Sun is distributed over the surface of the Earth and with 
            height above the ground.</P>
            <P>An example is the cyclones and anticyclones and associated cold 
            and warm fronts that arise from differences in the temperature of 
            the air in the <U>tropics</U> (where the Sun is more directly 
            overhead) and that at the <U>poles</U> of the Earth (where it is 
            always lower in the sky). The pole-to-equator temperature difference 
            is the result of the spherical shape of the planet, and the 
            different angles at which the Sun's rays enter the atmosphere and 
            reach the surface. The atmosphere responds to this unequal heating 
            by continual attempts to reduce the pole-to-equator temperature 
            gradients. It does this by generating, in the Northern Hemisphere, 
            southerly winds to carry warm air polewards and cold northerly winds 
            to carry the colder air to lower latitudes.</P>
            <P>Another example of atmospheric instability is <I>convection</I>: 
            the process through which near-surface air – warmed by solar heating 
            – expands and rises, producing <I>thermals</I> which carry heat 
            upward to give birth and shape to the clouds, and sometimes 
            thunderstorms that bring rain.</P>
            <P>When changes in solar radiation or any other component of the 
            climate system (such as the land surface, oceans, or glaciers) 
            influence the atmosphere in a <U>systematic</U><I>,</I> as opposed 
            to a random way, local weather patterns are likely to be affected, 
            and will remain in an altered condition for seasons or years or 
            longer. It is these more persistent changes in the prevailing 
            weather at any place – which is to say, the <I>climate</I> – for 
            which we can hope to find specific causes.</P>
            <P><FONT size=+0>The most rudimentary of all climate changes is the 
            annual cycle of the seasons, which results from the path of the 
            Earth around the Sun, and the 23 1/2</FONT><SUP><FONT

            next best understood – and the next most predictable climatic 
            variation, thanks to quite recent research accomplishments – is El 
            Niño, which occurs on an irregular schedule of a few 
            years.</FONT></P>

            <P>Records of past climate reveal that El Niños have been a 
            recurring feature of the Earth's climate for thousands of years. But 
            while we now know how their arrival is announced, and have set up 
            monitoring systems in the oceans to warn of their coming, we don't 
            know exactly when the next one, or the one after that, will first 
            show its face: beyond the knowledge that they appear, on average, 
            about every three to seven years.</P>
            <P>El Niños are often preceded or followed by the opposite phase, 
            dubbed La Niña, when surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific 
            Ocean are systematically <U>cooler</U> than the long-term average. A 
            corresponding modulation in the general circulation of the global 
            atmosphere – called the <I>Southern Oscillation</I> – is also 
            closely allied with these ocean changes. The name which is widely 
            used by scientists to refer to the three together is the <I>El 
            Niño-Southern Oscillation</I> phenomenon, or <I>ENSO.</I></P>
            <P>El Niño is the warm phase of ENSO, and La Niña the cold. Both 
            involve the tropical oceans and the atmosphere, and the exchange of 
            energy between the ocean surface and the air above it. The ocean and 
            the atmosphere are linked together, interactively, and each affects 
            the other. Atmospheric winds push the ocean currents and help 
            determine the patterns of sea surface temperature. But SSTs at the 
            same time help determine the force and direction of winds and 
            atmospheric circulation, by adding heat or taking it away, chiefly 
            by shifting the places where tropical thunderstorms preferentially 
            occur.</P>
            <P>The warmest large-scale pool of ocean water in the world is 
            normally found in the vicinity of Indonesia – south of China and 
            north of Australia. El Niño shifts the location of the warm water 
            pool over 3200 km (2000 miles) eastward, to more open waters near 
            the International Dateline or beyond. Meanwhile the normally dry 
            zone over the eastern equatorial Pacific – from mid Pacific islands 
            to the arid coasts of Chile and Peru and Ecuador – becomes much 
            wetter.</P>
            <P>When water vapor condenses and falls as rain, the heat that was 
            stored when the water was originally evaporated is released into the 
            air. Because of this, the major shift in the location of tropical 
            Pacific rainfall that accompanies an El Niño alters the heating 
            patterns of the whole atmosphere. Somewhat like a rock in a stream 
            of water, the placement of a new source of heat sets up waves in the 
            atmosphere that are as large as continents, and their effects reach 
            beyond the tropics into mid-latitude regions. In the end, winds and 
            storm tracks and the jet stream are all perturbed, in ways that 
            affect, to some degree, almost everyone on Earth.</P>
            <P>When La Niña takes control, the situation changes. Areas with 
            drier than normal or even drought conditions during El Niño, such as 
            Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and 
            parts of Africa and Brazil, are apt to experience heavy rains during 
            La Niña. Meanwhile, areas that have experienced El Niño floods, such 
            as Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and northern Argentina in South America, 
            parts of Africa, and southern parts of the U.S. in winter, are apt 
            to be drier than normal during the ensuing La Niña phase.</P>
            <P><B><I><FONT color=#006699>Impacts of the last El 
            Niño</FONT></I></B></P>
            <P>The most severe drought of the 1997-1998 El Niño struck 
            Indonesia, with the result that many of the fires commonly set to 
            clear land for agriculture raged out of control for weeks on end. So 
            much ash was carried into the air that respiratory problems were 
            reported as far as 1000 km (about 600 miles) away, and the loss of 
            visibility was held responsible for the crash of a commercial 
            airliner. El Niño-related drought and associated wildfires continued 
            into 1998 in Brazil, Mexico, and Florida. As expected with El Niño, 
            flooding hit Peru and Ecuador but also Chile, and coastal fisheries 
            were disrupted.</P>
            <P>Among the consequences of the 1997-98 El Niño was a persistent 
            Northern Hemisphere jet stream that in winter blew with particular 
            strength across the Pacific, over southern California, and then 
            across the southern states to Florida. Atmospheric disturbances 
            carried by these winds developed into major storms for the U.S., 
            pummeling the West Coast and creating wet conditions from California 
            to Florida. Storms generated by the jet stream as it crosses the 
            North Pacific normally veer to the north and end up in the Gulf of 
            Alaska, or enter the North American continent in the vicinity of 
            British Columbia and the state of Washington. There they often link 
            up with frigid Arctic and Canadian air masses and bring these down 
            as recurring waves of individual cold fronts into the U.S.</P>
            <P><FONT size=+0>When the jet stream instead veered south, the 
            result in the U.S. was relatively mild winter conditions over the 
            northern states that usually bear the brunt of these conditions, 
            such that temperatures in February in the Great Lakes area averaged 
            more than 10</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT size=+0> C 
            (18</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT size=+0> F) above 
            normal. The pattern was not confined to North America. The jet 
            stream in the Southern Hemisphere was affected in a similar way, 
            with similar effects on South America, where it was then late 
            summer. One of the results was that the uncommonly warm February of 
            1998 set a record for the greatest departure from the average global 
            temperature reading for any month on record.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=+0>A possibly unique development of 1997-98 El Niño 
            conditions was a marked warming of surface waters in <U>other</U> 
            tropical ocean basins. SSTs in the tropical Indian Ocean, for 
            example, which are customarily about 27</FONT><SUP><FONT

            size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT size=+0> F); these waters were then warm 
            enough to compete with the tropical Pacific in their effect on the 
            atmosphere. As a result, strong thunderstorms developed over the 
            western tropical Indian Ocean in October 1997, to spread over the 
            Horn of Africa region and bring torrential rains to southern Somalia 
            and Kenya for several months. Insect and disease outbreaks followed 
            the resulting floods, leading to the proliferation of vector-borne 
            diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever. As is 
            also often the case in the aftermath of severe storms, there and in 
            other parts of the world, polluted local water supplies, degraded 
            hygiene, and increased incidence of cholera occurred.</FONT></P>
            <P>In the spring of the year, the jet stream in the Northern 
            Hemisphere normally migrates northwards, carrying much of the 
            potential for stormy weather out of the reach of the central U.S. In 
            1998, however, as had happened on previous El Niño occasions, the 
            jet stream continued to trace a course somewhat south of its normal 
            position across the United States. As a result, a more 
            southerly-than-normal storm track was established from Idaho to New 
            England. This paved the way for a sequence of flooding events in 
            Iowa, flooding in the Ohio Valley, and the wettest June on record in 
            much of New England. It also diverted storms, and more normal 
            rainfall, from the southern states. Regional weather patterns of 
            this sort – wetter or colder in one area, dryer or hotter in another 
            – persist longer than usual in El Niño years. By April 1998 
            conditions were rapidly drying out in the South, setting the stage 
            for subsequent drought and wildfires.</P>

            <P>Specific weather events – such as a major snowstorm in February 
            in New England – cannot be attributed unequivocally to El Niño, or 
            indeed to any other climatic cause. The weather will always vary, 
            from day to day or week to week, and certainly from place to place 
            and, as noted earlier, unusual swings, this way or that, can always 
            be expected somewhere. What is definite is that El Niño, and La 
            Niña, change the odds that certain kinds of weather will occur in a 
            given place.</P>
            <P>The most probable range of expected temperature, precipitation, 
            and other meteorological conditions can be calculated for a given 
            area, based on the unique perturbations that El Niño SSTs impose on 
            the general circulation of the global atmosphere. This is done with 
            the help of highly-detailed computer models of the climate system. 
            The results will depend to some degree on what meteorological 
            conditions were assumed to apply at the start of the calculation. 
            But by repeating the modeled calculation for a representative range 
            of these so-called "starting conditions," we can explore the scope 
            of possible outcomes. These are then compared with what the same 
            model projects in the absence of the El Niño perturbation.</P>
            <P>The same models can be used to forecast the impacts of developing 
            El Niños, provided that reasonably reliable projections can be made 
            of sea surface temperatures. And indeed this can now be done, based 
            on our improved understanding of how El Niño works and given the SST 
            and sub-surface ocean observing system that is now in place in the 
            tropical Pacific Ocean.</P>
            <P>The new knowledge and observing capabilities were put to the test 
            when the 1997-98 El Niño came into being, and the world profited, 
            for climate simulations and forecasts throughout the event were more 
            consistent and more skillful than had been the case before. What 
            happened in these years to the circulation of the global atmosphere, 
            for example – as seen in the changes in the jet stream and in storm 
            tracks – was close to what was forecast by El Niño models several 
            months in advance.</P>
            <P>These successes can also help in identifying the cause of the 
            extreme weather of 1997-98. The accurate forecast, based on El Niño, 
            of many aspects of the winter weather patterns, is compelling 
            evidence that El Niño was indeed a major contributor. Attributing 
            the consequences – such as the proliferation of insects and other 
            pests, or the outbreak of disease – requires similar tests of a 
            longer chain of events, and is hence less certain. Nevertheless, the 
            sorts of El Niño impact chains that now seem likely include the 
            warmer and wetter conditions which favor the reproduction of 
            malaria-carrying mosquitoes, with consequences for public health; 
            and the lack of more normal freezing temperatures that would 
            ordinarily kill off or delimit populations of pests or fungi, with 
            possible impacts across the spectrum of animal life.</P>
            <P>The severe weather events that were attributed at the time to the 
            1997-98 El Niño dealt heavy blows to many geographic areas and 
            commercial sectors, while actually helping others. For instance, 
            while it may be possible to attribute the tornadoes in Florida to a 
            more active and southward-deflected storm track, it is possible that 
            without the interference from El Niño, equivalent tornado damage 
            could have been inflicted elsewhere, such as in neighboring Georgia, 
            with equivalent loss of life and property. A similar instance of 
            deflected misery can be found in the shift in 1997-98 hurricane 
            activity from the Atlantic basin to the Pacific.</P>
            <P>One of many examples of a different kind was the mixed benefit of 
            the warmer winter of 1997-98: a boon to consumers but not for the 
            natural gas and heating oil industries. These all highlight the need 
            to identify what was clearly attributable to the 1997-98 El Niño and 
            what was not. In doing this we need to consider both the positive 
            and negative impacts, in terms of human values as well as economic 
            terms. </P>

            <P><FONT size=+0>The terms "global warming" or "enhanced greenhouse 
            warming" are commonly used to describe the human-induced change in 
            global climate that is projected to occur in the course of the next 
            century or two. Behind the projection is a continuing and 
            well-documented increase in the concentration of the atmospheric 
            greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The most notable among them is 
            carbon dioxide, which accumulates in the air when fossil fuels – 
            such as coal or natural gas or gasoline – are burned, or when 
            forests are cleared. As a result of these human activities, the 
            amount of CO</FONT><SUB><FONT size=-2>2</FONT></SUB> that has 
            accumulated in the air today is 30 percent greater than the stable 
            levels of pre-Industrial times. Most of this increase, moreover, has 
            come about since 1950.</P>
            <P>Since these gases are the principal thermostat for the planet, 
            the question is not whether the global temperature will respond to 
            their increasing concentrations, but when, and by how much, and 
            whether other climate factors – such as clouds or ocean circulation 
            – might possibly compensate, and soften the blow.</P>
            <P>There are many signs, including but not limited to meteorological 
            data, that the expected global warming may already be upon us. The 
            average surface temperature of the Earth has been gradually rising 
            for the last 100 years, and more steeply in the past two decades (<A 
            href="http://www.gcrio.org/consequences/vol5no1/fig_1a.html">Figure 
            1</A>). The last ten years are the warmest decade on record. 1998 is 
            far and away the warmest year on record, and 1997 the second 
            warmest.</P>
            <P><FONT size=+0>The oft-cited value for the amount that the average 
            surface temperature of the Earth has warmed during the present 
            century is about 0.5</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT 
            size=+0> C (or 1</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT 
            size=+0> F.) These numbers, however, were derived for the period 
            through 1995. As a result of a record-warm 1997, and an even hotter 
            1998, the overall warming relative to last century is now closer to 
            0.8</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT size=+0> C 
            (1.5</FONT><SUP><FONT size=-1>o</FONT></SUP><FONT size=+0> F). The 
            melting of glaciers over most of the world, diminishing sea-ice in 
            polar waters, and rising sea level are among the growing number of 
            signs that seem to confirm the reality of the increase in global 
            temperature.</FONT></P>
            <P>Nature responds to weather in ways that enable those who study 
            tree-rings and ice cores and other <I>paleodata</I> to extend our 
            knowledge of climate history far back into the past. A recent 
            analysis of the most extensive of such records produced a 
            year-by-year temperature history for much of the Earth for the last 
            1000 years: adding over eight centuries to what we can glean from 
            available thermometer readings. In no year – or decade – of that 
            long span was the average temperature of the Earth as warm as it is 
            now.</P>
            <P>Hotter air temperatures are but one of many consequences when 
            extra heat is added to the lower atmosphere, as will happen with 
            enhanced global greenhouse warming. Another result is increased 
            evaporation of surface moisture. Hotter air can hold more water and, 
            together with enhanced evaporation, the inevitable result is a 
            marked increase in atmospheric moisture. In the U.S., for example, 
            the average amount of moisture in the atmosphere increased by 5 
            percent per decade in the years from 1973 to 1993. This remarkable 
            trend toward wetter and wetter air is more than can be accounted for 
            by global warming alone, however, highlighting the need to account 
            for El Niño-related and other changes.</P>
            <P>When the hydrologic cycle is predisposed in this way by global 
            warming, naturally-occurring droughts – such as those brought on by 
            El Niño – will set in quicker, plants will wilt sooner, and the 
            droughts will likely become more extensive and longer lasting. 
            Moreover, when there is little or no moisture in the soil to 
            evaporate, all the incident solar radiation goes into raising 
            temperature, bringing on sweltering heat waves of the sort that 
            plagued Texas in 1998.</P>
            <P align=left>Further, over the Earth as a whole, any enhanced 
            evaporation must be balanced, somewhere, sometime, by an equivalent 
            increase in precipitation, for the global atmosphere can hold but so 
            much water. Outside the tropics, moreover, roughly 75 percent of the 
            water that falls as rain or snow comes from moisture that was stored 
            in the atmosphere when the storm began. Thus with more moisture in 
            the atmosphere, we can expect an enhancement of rainfall or snowfall 
            in precipitating weather systems, be they thunderstorms, or 
            extra-tropical rain or snow storms. Over the U.S., as in many other 
            parts of the world, the number of heavy rainfall events has been 
            increasing throughout the current century, adding to the potential 
            for floods. The amount of annual precipitation has also increased by 
            about 10 percent in the last 100 years. Thus, observations show that 
            when it rains it pours, harder than it would have under similar 
            circumstances just a couple of decades ago!</P>
            <P>We should note that heavy rainfall is but one of several factors 
            that determine whether or not a flood occurs. The spatial extent of 
            the storm, the total amount of rain, and the rainfall rate are also 
            important, as are the nature and condition of the terrain on which 
            it falls. Important factors regarding the land include whether 
            melting snow is present; the precondition of natural drains, streams 
            and rivers; whether ice dams exist; and the degree of soil wetness. 
            Geophysical, topographical, and vegetation conditions are all 
            involved. Every bit as important, however, is whether human land use 
            and structures, such as ditches, dams, levees, and reservoirs, allow 
            the runoff to be channeled and ultimately managed. Because of these 
            factors, flood records in themselves are unreliable indicators of 
            changes in rainfall.</P>

            <P>How much might the Earth warm with added greenhouse gases, and 
            what can we expect in years ahead in terms of altered weather? Many 
            projections have been made, in scientific laboratories around the 
            world, using the best available climate models. Most commonly they 
            endeavor to foretell conditions through the next century or so, to 
            about the year 2100. But the models used, by necessity, include 
            assumptions that can have a major influence on what they 
project.</P>
            <P>By far the most uncertain of these are the "what if" assumptions 
            regarding the often personal choices that people and governments 
            will make, around the world, in years to come. For example, the 
            projections of global warming models depend heavily on what each 
            assumes about future rates of energy production and fossil fuel 
            consumption. The projected rate of temperature increase will depend, 
            in addition, on how faithfully the model simulates natural 
            processes, including how clouds are depicted, or how vegetation 
            responds. A climate model's answer to questions asked of it is 
            almost never the single, simple answer that policy-makers want.</P>
            <P><FONT size=+0>In spite of all the caveats and uncertainties, an

            <P>The El Niño of 1997-98 was in many ways the largest yet recorded. 
            Was this by chance, or was it lifted to record levels by the help of 
            other hands? In attempting to answer that question we should first 
            note that El Niños seem to have marched to a different drummer in 
            the course of the last twenty years. Since 1976, there have been 
            more El Niños (7) and fewer La Niñas (4), when compared with the 
            historical record of the previous hundred years – in which the two 
            have occurred in more equal numbers. In the past two decades, 
            moreover, we have seen the two biggest El Niños on record – -the 
            most recent, and the previous record holder, 1982-83 – -as well as 
            the longest on record. The latter persisted for half a decade, from 
            roughly 1990 to mid-1995, as three modest El Niños were blurred into 
            one, when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific failed 
            to fall below average conditions in between.</P>
            <P>When the character of El Niño changes so dramatically, and for so 
            many years, we suspect that something else – most likely global 
            greenhouse warming – is also involved.</P>
            <P>Before we make that claim, however, we need a plausible 
            explanation of how a long-term, global warming trend could have so 
            marked an effect on a recurring feature of shorter-term climate 
            change; how it might favor and accentuate El Niños, at the expense 
            of the opposite, La Niña phase; and what the combined effect should 
            be, in terms of our day-to-day weather.</P>
            <P><I><B><FONT color=#006699>Charging and discharging the Warm Water 
            Pool</FONT></B></I></P>
            <P>How might El Niño be affected by global warming? The amount of 
            warm water in the tropics builds up prior to – and is then depleted 
            during – each El Niño. During the years of the cold La Niña phase, 
            clearer skies are more prevalent across the wide Pacific, allowing 
            radiation from the Sun to gradually warm the surface waters of the 
            tropical Pacific Ocean. The added heat is stirred and redistributed 
            by ocean currents, with most of it carried westward, where it 
            accumulates in the deep Warm Pool in the equatorial western 
            Pacific.</P>
            <P>At the start of an El Niño, warm water from this Pacific 
            reservoir is carried eastwards towards South America, to initiate 
            the chain of events on the world's weather that are now well known. 
            After their long eastward sweep along the equator, the warmer 
            surface waters are deflected north or south toward higher latitude 
            by altered ocean currents. Some of the heat that they have carried 
            escapes to the air, mainly by increased evaporation, which further 
            cools the ocean surface. When this added moisture falls out as rain 
            – usually hundreds or thousands of miles away – it contributes to a 
            general rise in surface temperature around the world that peaks a 
            few months after the start of a strong El Niño event.</P>
            <P>It was not by chance that the record-breaking temperatures of the 
            first half of 1998 came just after the December 1997 peak of the 
            1997-98 El Niño, during the time when the Pacific Ocean was rapidly 
            dumping its excess heat. This suggests that ENSO events are most 
            simply an alternating sequence of storing up and then releasing 
            thermal energy – like repeatedly filling a bucket, then pouring most 
            of it out. The spacing of ENSO events would then be determined by 
            the time spent in recharging the system – that is, in accumulating a 
            sufficient volume of warm water in the tropics – plus the time for 
            the ensuing El Niño to run its course. An endless cycle of charging 
            and then discharging would also explain why El Niños are preceded 
            and followed by La Niñas.</P>
            <P><B><I><FONT color=#006699>The effects of global 
            warming</FONT></I></B></P>
            <P>If ENSO is fundamentally a process that redistributes heat within 
            the climate system, then tampering with the global thermostat – by 
            injecting more greenhouse gases into the air – will likely 
            interfere. Some possible explanations for the changed behavior of El 
            Niños in the past twenty years are that the Warm Pool in the 
            tropical western Pacific is expanding; and/or the recharge phase of 
            El Niño has speeded up; and/or the heat loss phase is less 
            efficient. Any of these could follow from warming and result in more 
            frequent El Niño events. With global greenhouse warming we should 
            expect higher temperatures in the upper layers of the ocean, and a 
            steeper drop in temperature beneath the surface, which would 
            increase the magnitude of swings between La Niña and El Niño.</P>
            <P>One of the projected effects of global warming in climate models 
            are changes in ENSO patterns and frequency, but as yet, none of the 
            models simulates ENSO with sufficient fidelity to give confidence to 
            the results. Also, how clouds might change, and especially the 
            brightness of the ever-present convective clouds at equatorial 
            latitudes, is particularly uncertain and can influence the outcome. 
            Similar questions apply to the ocean, where changes that might alter 
            the slow stirring of water beneath the surface could act in ways 
            that are quite uncertain. Thus the question of how El Niño will 
            change with global warming is not yet answered.</P>
            <P>This also highlights the need for more comprehensive climate 
            models, and particularly those that deal not only with El Niño and 
            SSTs, but changes in the composition of the atmosphere, as well, 
            including the greenhouse gases and solid pollutants that we add, and 
            debris from volcanic eruptions. The impacts of the El Chichon 
            volcanic eruption in Mexico in April 1982 – at the time of onset of 
            the 1982-83 El Niño – have yet to be combed from the snarled 
            climatic record of these two overlapping events. Could this chance 
            eruption explain some of the differences between the 1982-83 and 
            1997-98 El Niños?</P>
            <P>When someday we make reliable climate projections months or years 
            in advance, as now is done for the daily weather, the models 
            employed will of necessity include these and all other likely 
            climate forcings. They will also recognize that interannual 
            variations, like ENSO events, take place in a setting of decadal 
            changes, and these, in turn, against a back-drop of even longer-term 
            variations, which may be controlled by the world's oceans, and 
            perhaps the Sun.</P>

            temperature</FONT></I></B></P>
            <P>Although the average temperature of the Earth has been generally 
            rising (<A 
            href="http://www.gcrio.org/consequences/vol5no1/fig_1a.html">Figure 
            1</A>), the change, from place to place, is not at all the same. 
            What we know of the atmosphere – and particularly the nature of 
            atmospheric waves – would seem to guarantee a global inequality: 
            some areas with greater-than-average warming, others with less, and 
            a few where the average temperature has even dropped. The status of 
            recent warming over the Earth, shown in <A 
            href="http://www.gcrio.org/consequences/vol5no1/fig_2a.html">Figure 
            2</A>, reveals that warming has been largest over most of the 
            northern continents, much less in the eastern half of the United 
            States, and absent altogether in the North and South Pacific and 
            North Atlantic, where ocean surface temperatures have cooled 
            somewhat.</P>
            <P>It has also been demonstrated that the pattern of warmer winter 
            temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere arises in large part from 
            changes in atmospheric circulation. Some of these changes in flow 
            are linked to El Niño, whereby warming in the tropical Pacific is 
            spread along the coast of North America and throughout much of 
            Canada and Alaska. The cooling in the North and South Pacific can 
            also be attributed to the increase in El Niños.</P>
            <P>Other changes were a wintertime increase in westerly winds in the 
            Atlantic ocean area, that contributed to warmer temperatures 
            throughout Europe and Asia and cooler ones over the western North 
            Atlantic and Greenland. Overall, the land has warmed more than the 
            ocean, in large part because of the way the atmospheric winds have 
            changed.</P>
            <P>It is not at all clear how the atmospheric circulation will 
            respond to further increases in greenhouse warming. Nor can we 
            anticipate, given these uncertainties, the meteorological 
            consequences that could follow alterations in so fundamental a 
            feature of the atmosphere. We should expect, however, that global 
            warming will be manifested through changes in natural modes of 
            behavior of the climate system, such as ENSO, by way of changes in 
            the relative frequency and strengths of El Niño and La Niña events. 
            Moreover, the ENSO-caused floods and droughts will be exacerbated by 
            global warming.</P>
            <P>One of the major impacts of El Niño involves the distribution and 
            intensity of hurricanes. In El Niño years, there is more vigorous 
            activity in the Pacific – especially the central and eastern 
            portions – and fewer and less energetic hurricanes in the Atlantic 
            and Caribbean. When the opposite, La Niña conditions prevail, as in 
            1995 and the latter half of 1998, the Atlantic is again more prone 
            to an active hurricane season. What is not so clear is how global 
            warming will influence hurricanes. While hotter SSTs can fuel more 
            vigorous storms, with global warming the increase in air temperature 
            will exceed that of the sea, which should stabilize the atmosphere 
            and decrease the potential for tropical storms.</P>

            <P>El Niño brings on floods and droughts in different parts of the 
            world, and global warming will likely exacerbate the extremes of 
            flooding and drought, no matter what their origin. Moreover, any 
            change in the average rainfall or temperature or other

            shift in the expected extremes.</P>

            <P>Extremes in temperature or other meteorological indicators are 
            exceedingly important to both natural systems and to human systems 
            and infrastructure, in that they, and we, are designed to tolerate a 
            limited range of natural weather conditions. We readily adapt and 
            adjust to the variability and frequency of extremes that accompany 
            that span. But when extremes are reached that exceed the accustomed 
            spread, or when they are encountered more often, the limits of 
            adaptation or of linear response can easily be exceeded: as with the 
            "straw that breaks the camel's back."</P>
            <P>Flooding is an example. With global warming, the 100-year floods 
            that are routinely considered in building and land-use practices – 
            expected, on average, but once each century – may now become 50- or 
            30-year floods. The change could be seen in floods that flow over 
            dams or break levees, inundating the surrounding countryside and 
            urban areas, resulting in drownings, water damage, and more subtle 
            impacts that include polluted drinking water.</P>
            <P>The late-1998 flooding of the Yangtze River is a recent case, but 
            the same has also happened in the United States: in California in 
            early 1997, in the Red River valley in the Dakotas in spring 1997, 
            and in the Upper Mississippi Basin in 1993, to cite but three 
            examples. Insect and disease outbreaks often follow, especially in 
            tropical countries, where, as in some areas of Africa and South 
            America, cholera outbreaks and mosquito-borne diseases such as 
            malaria, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever are often associated 
            with flooding.</P>

                some areas (such as Chile, Peru, California, and the 
                southeastern U.S.), and to drought in others (as in Indonesia 
                and Central America) that resulted in out-of-control fires, 
                often arising from slash and burn agriculture, in spite of ample 
                warnings. While changes in precipitation with global warming 
                would differ from those of the El Niño, the effects on 
                agriculture, water resources, and fires, for example, and how 
                communities dealt with them, could be much the same. </LI></UL></UL>

                <LI>The expected emergence of a number of significant, secondary 
                impacts. The fires in Indonesia, for example, brought 
                respiratory problems to areas that were 600 miles away. Some of 
                the results of California floods were an abundance of insects, 
                rodents, and snakes, an increase in soil fungus, and 
                contamination of domestic water supplies with consequences for 
                human health. Uncommon winter rains in the U.S. Southwest 
                resulted in swarms of grasshoppers in Arizona, and a surge in 
                the population of hantavirus-carrying rodents in New Mexico. 
                Outbreaks of disease occurred, such as Rift Valley fever in 
                Kenya, cholera in Peru and Tanzania, and malaria in Africa, 
                which could have been anticipated (and to some extent were.) All 
                of these can provide lessons for other climatic changes. 
            </LI></UL></UL>
            <UL>
              <UL>
                <LI>Because prediction was possible and warnings were made, 
                individuals and institutions could respond in ways that lessened 
                the negative impacts. Some were unable to act; others chose not 
                to. Projections of impending climate change associated with 
                global warming are also now available, in large part through the 
                continuing efforts of the IPCC, and are being taken notice of by 
                some communities and countries more than others. </LI></UL></UL>
            <P>These and other examples demonstrate the potential benefit of 
            enlightened mitigation. For example, in some areas, including 
            Australia, the removal of litter and debris reduced the risk of 
            drought-associated fires. In some flood prone areas, drains and 
            ditches were cleared, roofs repaired, and dikes strengthened in 
            anticipation of the forecast heavy rains. Advanced plans were made 
            for medical supplies, or for meeting anticipated shortages in food 
            and other commodities. In retrospect, far more could have been done, 
            given the overall accuracy of what was forecast.</P>
            <P>The modeled projections were not wholly on the mark, for in some 
            areas (and notably in Asia) the forecasts did not match what 
            happened. As a result, efforts to prepare were misdirected, and we 
            can assume, public faith in future projections of this kind was 
            probably eroded. In these experiences, good and bad, we have for 
            future study a natural experiment in how people, institutions, and 
            governments can cope, particularly in making decisions under 
            uncertainty, and lessons for longer-term climate change, whatever 
            its cause.</P>

            <P>To explain the weather disruptions over the past year or so, or 
            weigh the influences of El Niño or possible global warming, it is 
            important to have (1) a picture of what happened over the whole 
            Earth, as opposed to a single country, or region, or hemisphere; (2) 
            weather data from at least several months, to allow temporal and 
            geographic patterns to be discerned; and (3) a perspective that 
            encompasses all aspects of the weather.</P>
            <P>In particular, it is misleading to think only in terms of 
            temperatures when considering the effects of global warming. The 
            "air conditioning" effects of moisture are extremely important in 
            making meaningful projections of climatic change, as are regional 
            differences in where weather systems develop and persistent 
            conditions apply. For example, through the winter of 1997-98 in the 
            U.S., the <U>wet</U> regions in the South were quite distinct from 
            the <U>warm</U> regions in the North, and vice versa in the 
            spring.</P>
            <P>The floods and droughts that future El Niños will usher in are 
            likely to be exacerbated by global warming, whether or not El Niños 
            are themselves affected – in that these transient disturbances will 
            be imposed on a climate system that is in some ways already 
            disturbed. But the El Niño phenomenon could also be itself 
            transformed as the underlying climate warms, evolving, perhaps, in 
            the direction of more frequent and more energetic appearances, or in 
            ways that we can not as yet foresee.</P>
            <P>Unquestionably, for fifteen consecutive months – from April 1997 
            until about July of the following year – the last and greatest El 
            Niño of this century exerted a dominant influence on all aspects of 
            prevailing weather patterns. Its heavy hand shifted weather patterns 
            on the global map, and held them there, relentlessly. Similarly, 
            after June 1998, the rapidly developing La Niña exerted major 
            influence: on the hurricane season and especially Asian 
flooding.</P>
            <P>It is likely that global warming also contributed. Since the time 
            of the 1995 IPCC assessment, observational evidence has continued to 
            mount for a significant human influence on global climate. The best 
            assessment of the contribution of enhanced greenhouse warming to the 
            climate of today is that it is still small, but it is there. The 
            expected signals seem now to be emerging from the noise of 
            background variability, most clearly, perhaps, in the nature of 
            weather extremes. And while some changes arising from global warming 
            could prove benign or even beneficial, the economic costs of the 
            impacts of more extreme weather are substantial and clearly warrant 
            further attention in policy debates.</P>
            <P>It may prove significant that the emergence of clear signs of 
            global surface warming, beginning in the late 1970s, is coincident 
            in time with the more frequent appearance of El Niños. A possible 
            explanation is that although present, the global warming influence 
            was until that time insufficient to perturb the normal working of 
            the climate system: that its capacity to affect the overall behavior 
            of the climate system was reached only after a certain threshold had 
            been passed. Were this what really happened, it would identify 
            global greenhouse warming as an abrupt, as opposed to a gradual, and 
            thus more easily accommodated climate change. It may take several 
            years to determine whether this perspective is the right one.</P>
