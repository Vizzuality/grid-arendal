          <TD><TT>This is the third reprocessing facility in Western Europe. 
            Although the operators of Dounreay, UKAEA, like to present it as a 
            'research' facility (it is even listed as such in the OSPAR 
            submissions made by the UK) amongst other activities, Dounreay 
            commercially reprocesses nuclear fuel, mostly originating from 
            research reactors and containing Highly Enriched Uranium. Figures 
            for discharges in the last 5 years show a significant increase in 
            discharges of Beta emitters and Alpha emitters.

        <TR>
          <TD><TT>The recent increases in discharges from La Hague and 
            Sellafield are particularly important from a radiological point of 
            view since the concerned isotopes are highly effective in their 
            impact on human health. Due to the massive spread of the discharged 
            radioactivity from reprocessing facilities, the impact will not be 
            limited to the areas but can be seen on a major scale from the 
            Western European to the Scadinandinavian countries and even 
            affecting the Arctic waters. To give an example, the I-129 and Tc-99 
            'signals' originating from La Hague and Sellafield respectively will 
            be of significant importance to the waters off the Norwegian coast 
            in the years to come.
            <P>Tc-99 discharges from Sellafield were in 1994 by far the largest 
            contributor to the individual dose to critical groups (seafood 
            consumers in Cumbria) with 47% of the dose of 0,06 mSv/y in 1994. 
            The near three fold increase of Tc-99 discharges in 1995 is 
            therefore expected to have an even larger contribution (60%-70%) to 
            these individuals, significantly raising the doses suffered due to 
            the liquid discharges of Sellafield. A similar conclusion can be 
            drawn when the recent trends are considered with respect to the 
            collective dose to the world population. The increase in the 
            discharge of C-14 is largely responsible for the increase in the 
            projected collective dose. Increasing the C-14 discharges will 
            inevitably raise the total radiological burden of the facility 
            considerably.
            <P>At La Hague the collective doses calculated over the next 500 
            years to the local and regional population by consumption of seafood 
            and other pathways are dominated by C-14 discharges. Although COGEMA 
            does not provide official data on C-14 releases, it is obvious that 
            the total C-14 activity in liquid releases is also raising 
            significantly with the amount of fuel reprocessed. This increase has 
            a large effect on the collective dose to the regional population. It 
            is justified to conclude that any increase in C-14 discharges is to 
            be avoided. 
            <P>With respect to the projected global collective dose from La 
            Hague, it is remarkable that exactly the isotopes which have shown 
            significant increases in the last few years, I-129, C-14, Kr-85 
            etc., are the most significant ones. Figure 5 shows the projected 
            increase in collective doses to the global population due to 
            discharges from La Hague.

        <TR>
          <TD><TT>In the light of the available data on discharges and their 
            expected dose implications it is clear that the radiological impact 
            on human health and the environment of reprocessing is by far the 
            largest of all elements in the nuclear fuel cycle. It is therefore 
            not surprising that the OSPAR Convention area (plus the Baltic) e.g. 
            the North East Atlantic, in which the biggest reprocessing 
            facilities are located, clearly stands out as the ocean area giving 
            the highest collective doses in the world from the consumption of 
            seafood containing man-made radionuclides.
            <P>These radiological consequences will undoubtedly have their 
            impact on human health. The last few decades a lot of 
            epidemiological research has been conducted on the effects of 
            radiation and it is now scientifically understood that the 
            linear-no-threshold-theory is the only acceptable tool to describe 
            detrimental effects of radiation to human populations. This means 
            that the currently occurring increase in discharges from 
            reprocessing facilities will result in a dramatic increase in 
            radiation induced cancer mortalities and probable environmental 
            impacts. With the current knowledge of radiation risk factors the 
            collective dose due to La Hague's discharges for the year 1995 can 
            be expected to result in more than 170 cancer fatalities. 
            <P>Indications of harmfull radiation effects to local population 
            around the reprocessing facilities are already visible. All three 
            reprocessing facilities - at Dounreay, La Hague and Sellafield - 
            have leukaemia clusters nearby, and the most recent study at La 
            Hague has concluded that there is statistical evidence for a causal 
            link.
            <P>Moreover the effects of radiation are often evaluated in terms of 
            human health alone and neglect the impact on wildlife and 
            ecosystems. The detrimental effects on the environment are however 
            likely to be far greater than on humans, due to the fact that the 
            environment is directly affected by the discharges. The surroundings 
            of the outlets from reprocessing facilities are for instance 
            submitted to relatively very high doses of radiation and radioactive 
            contamination far beyond levels regarded as 'acceptable'. Ecosystem 
            impacts of radioactive discharges have not been systematically or 
            comprehensively evaluated to-date.
            <P><A name=conclusion>Conclusions</A>
            <P>The reprocessing industry has repeatedly stated that it is 
            effectively reducing its discharges. In fact the opposite is true. 
            Since the beginning of the 1990s the liquid discharges of 
            reprocessing facilities have increased significantly, both in terms 
            of released activity as well as in terms of their radiological 
            impact on human health and potential impacts on marine ecosystems.
            <P>The increase is in clear contrast with the legal obligation set 
            out in the Paris (1974) and OSPAR (1992) Conventions to "take all 
            possible steps to reduce and eliminate pollution and [to] take the 
            necessary measures to protect the [North East Atlantic] against the 
            adverse effects of human activities so as to safeguard human health 
            and to conserve marine ecosystems" and the recognised "need to 
            reduce radioactive discharges from nuclear installations to the 
            marine environment".
            <P>These discharges clearly can be avoided by implementing other 
            spent nulcear fuel management strategies. Reprocessing is just one 
            way of managing the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle before trying 
            to find a final disposal option for nuclear waste. Due to its 
            massive discharges into the environment, reprocessing is in direct 
            violation of the IAEA's principle for radioactive waste management.
            <P>The recent increases in routine liquid discharges from 
            reprocessing facilities are some of the worst possible in terms of 
            the radiological burden on humans and the environment. The increases 
            in discharges and their massive spread through the oceanic currents 
            will result in a dramatic increase in collective and individual 
            doses to large populations worldwide, raising the expected number of 
            cancer fatalities as a result of reprocessing discharges.
