<H2>Caribbean Islands</H2>
<H3>Land Tenure and Use</H3>
<P>Jamaica's total land area covers over 1 million hectares, 25 percent of which 
were under cultivation in the 1980s. In 1985, about 145,000 hectares, mostly in 
the coastal plains, were determined to be highly fertile, and 350,000 hectares 
were suitable for cultivation with various limitations. Some 160,000 hectares of 
agricultural land remained idle or underutilized. Twenty-four percent of total 
land, some 265,000 hectares, was covered with natural forest of commercial 
value. By mid-decade Jamaica had roughly 155,000 farms,down considerably from 
the 1978-79 agriculture census total of 179,700. Most farms were small; over 90 
percent of all farms had four hectares or less. Farms having more than 20 
hectares contained 43 percent of total cultivated land, however. According to 
the agriculture census of 1978-79, the average farm measured 3 hectares, and the 
island's largest farms, those 200 hectares and over, averaged 784 hectares. 
Sugarcane still covered over 25 percent of all agricultural land in use, 
followed by bananas, root crops, coconuts, citrus, and pimento. 
<P>Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Most 
concentration of land in the postwar period resulted from urban migration and 
the purchases of very large tracts of land by incoming bauxite companies. The 
most important land reform programs in the postwar period were the 1966 Land 
Development and Utilization Act (also known as the Idle Land Law) and Project 
Land Lease introduced in 1973. The 1966 act allowed the government to encourage 
either the productive use, sale, or lease of some 40,000 hectares identified for 
the program. Project Land Lease attempted a more integrated rural development 
approach, providing small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as 
fertilizer, and access to credit. The plan helped more than 23,000 farmers 
cultivate 18,000 hectares. It is estimated that 14 percent of idle land was 
redistributed through Project Land Lease. Redistribution was still perceived by 
some as slow, inadequate, and containing marginally arable land, however; still 
others saw it as highly uneconomical and partisan in political terms. In the 
1970s, unrealistically high expectations over land reform, as well as economic 
frustration, caused some sporadic land seizures and squatting, which found 
little government support. Redistribution of land in the 1970s emphasized 
cooperative ownership, a decision that sharply increased the number of 
cooperatives on the island and made members an important political force. 
<P>Government policies toward land tenure and land use shifted in the 1980s in 
favor of privatization, commercialization, and modernization of agriculture. 
Sugar cooperatives were dismantled, some government holdings were divested, and 
foreign investment was sought to update farming methods and help develop new 
product lines, or "nontraditional exports." Agro-21, established in 1983 to 
spearhead the new agriculture policies, held the ambitious objective of putting 
80,000 hectares of idle land into the hands of the private sector in four years. 
The program relied heavily on international consultants and foreign investment; 
for example, the most prominent Agro-21 project, the Spring Plains farm, 
utilized Israeli technology. Although success was mixed, the program was 
responsible for growth in the production and export of nontraditional crops, 
such as winter vegetables, flowers, and Jamaican ethnic crops. 
<P>Traditional farming methods, including slash-and-burn methods, still 
dominated on most small farms. The mountainous island suffered from serious 
erosion problems, the result of farming on overly steep hillsides in the 
interior. Such farming has caused long-term damage to the country's topsoil, 
lowering soil productivity up to one-third according to some estimates. Most 
small farmers tended to grow a diversity of crops along with one main crop. Few 
peasants were solely subsistence farmers as the great majority traded a part of 
their produce and participated in the exchange economy. 
<P>In the 1980s, the use of such agricultural inputs as machinery, fertilizers, 
irrigated water, and technical assistance was slowly growing. Most small farmers 
still used handtools, especially the machete instead of more expensive power 
tools. A large percentage of the machinery was found on medium-to-large farms, 
but farms of up to two hectares used a surprisingly large amount of machinery 
for the size of the plot. According to data from the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization, the number of tractors in use on the island increased by 5.6 
percent from 1971 to 1980, averaging eleven in use per 1,000 hectares of arable 
land in 1983; despite the improvement, this ratio was relatively low. 
<P>Fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigated water were likewise used in moderate 
amounts. Chemical fertilizers were not widely used, and animal manure and mulch 
were more common among small farmers. The use of chemical fertilizers declined 
by 4.8 percent in the 1970s after an increase of some 7.2 percent in the 1960s. 
Declining use of fertilizers continued in the 1980s. Fertilizer use was most 
prevalent for large export crops such as sugarcane, bananas, and citrus. 
Pesticides were even less common than fertilizers and were utilized mostly for 
sugarcane. Irrigated water covered 12 percent of arable land in 1983, up from an 
8-percent level in 1965. 
<P>Most agricultural research occurred within the Ministry of Agriculture, but 
various farmer associations, such as the Coffee Industry Board or the Coconut 
Industry Board, provided research, as did the UWI at Mona. The Saturday edition 
of the <EM>Daily Gleaner</EM> provided farmers with valuable information on 
planting, harvesting, and new techniques. Agricultural extension workers were 
also active in Jamaica, including Ministry of Agriculture officials, crop 
associations, and agents of both local and foreign development organizations. 
The most important national farmer's organization was the Jamaican Agricultural 
Society, to which most farmers belonged. 
<P>Access to credit had increased since the integrated rural development plans 
of Project Land Lease in the 1970s, and augmenting credit to farmers continued 
to be an important government policy in the 1980s. The most customary sources of 
credit included the People's Cooperative Banks, commercial banks, Agriculture 
Credit Board, Agriculture Credit Bank, and Jamaican Agricultural Development 
Foundation. High interest rates in Jamaica throughout the 1980s prevented most 
small farmers from obtaining commercial bank loans. Nonetheless, the growth of 
private commercialized farming doubled the number of outstanding agricultural 
loans from commercial banks between 1980 and 1985. Multilateral and bilateral 
development agencies supported a number of projects in 1987 designed to improve 
export crops, rural parish markets, fumigation and certification, and overseas 
marketing.
