<PRE></PRE>WASHINGTON (Feb. 14, 2000) -- Rivers at their highest levels in 50 
years in South Africa and Mozambique have left a trail of death and destruction 
that isn't expected to end anytime soon. 
<P>At least 43 have died as a result of flooding caused by torrential rains that 
swamped parts of southern Africa and cut off links between South Africa and 
Mozambique. 
<P>As displaced people flock to churches and makeshift relief centers, the 
U.S.-based faith community is responding. 
<P>Church World Service (CWS) received a request from the Mozambican Council of 
Churches for assistance, and is currently coordinating with Action by Churches 
Together (ACT) with plans to issue a financial appeal for emergency relief. ACT 
is a relief agency of Protestant and Orthodox churches coordinated through the 
World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation, both based in 
Geneva, Switzerland. 
<P>During international disasters, CWS usually works through ACT and also sends 
relief items such as health kits, cleanup kits, and layette kits. Cash donations 
enable items to be purchased in bulk or purchased locally, boosting economies 
weakened by disaster. 
<P>The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), which issued a report 
describing the flooding as "catastrophic," has been in communication with 
Methodist leaders in both South Africa and Mozambique as well as with the South 
African Council of Churches. UMCOR is sending emergency funds to these partners 
so they can purchase tents, food, medicine, and other relief items. Donors can 
designate funds for either South Africa or Mozambique at this point. UMCOR will 
also coordinate with ACT after an appeal is issued. 
<P>The flood has swept away homes, caused landslides, and cut off roads and 
communications. UMCOR officials also reported that, at this time, cash 
contributions are the best way for individuals to help. 
<P>Residents from the community of Alexandra, threatened by the rising Jukskei 
River, took shelter in churches and schools. An emergency services rescue team 
that covers the greater Johannesburg area is also assisting affected residents. 
<P>Emergency officials said at this time, it is difficult to estimate how many 
people have been left homeless. One Rhema Church center reported more than 100 
displaced people had come to the church for shelter. 
<P>The raging Jukskei River swept away shacks and anyone who did not evacuate. 
Many residents had to flee with no belongings. Residents are lining up under 
still-pouring rain behind vans that are distributing clothes and food from All 
Nations Ministries. Emergency officials say they are concerned about people who 
refuse to evacuate. 
<P>Roads in this township and others are filled with water, and rivers continue 
to eat away the banks directly underneath shacks and homes. 
<P>Across South African and Mozambique, roads are cut off and water levels are 
still rising. People are being advised to evacuate but not to cross rivers that 
may look less deep or swift than they really are. 
<P>Rain continues in most areas, and potable water is becoming more and more 
scarce. Flooding has cut off a road linking Botswana to Zimbabwe and South 
Africa. Links between Mozambique, Swaziland, and South Africa are also 
impassable at this time. 
<P>In Mozambique, four people died when a bus was swept away by raging 
floodwaters. Hundreds of traders and tourists were stranded when the major road 
between Mozambique and South Africa was cut off. Some 800 trucks are also 
stranded on the Botswana side of the border by high waters. 
<P>South Africa is providing aid to Mozambique, where floods have isolated 
cities, leaving more than 100,000 needing aid. Officials are concerned about the 
onset of disease. 
<P>In Mozambique's capital of Maputa, floodwaters damaged sanitation facilities, 
making the risk high for an outbreak of cholera or malaria. Mosquitoes that 
carry malaria live in stagnant water, and malaria is already Mozambique's 
biggest killer. More than two million people are infected each year, and as many 
as one in seven die. 
<P>The floodwaters also destroyed crucial crops, and caused major damage in 
South Africa's famed Kruger National Park. Scores of tourists were evacuated 
from the park on Wednesday, disrupting one of South Africa's largest cash 
earners. 
<P>The torrential rains stretched across the South African provinces of 
Northern, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng. Many dams overflowed, as rivers swept away 
bridges and roads. 
<P>The Northern and Mpumalanga provinces were worst affected, with more than 30 
of the 43 deaths occurring in those regions. One was an 80-year-old woman whose 
house collapsed on her. Weather forecasters are predicting more rains and 
thunderstorms through next week. Damages have already been estimated at $39.4 
million.
