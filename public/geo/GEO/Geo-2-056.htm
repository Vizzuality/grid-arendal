      <P><BIG><B>Executive Summary</B></BIG><BR>November 2000</P>
      <P>China, the world's most populous country, has one of the longest 
      traditions of water resources and river management in the world. The 
      civilisation has sought to control the effects of floods and drought in 
      some of the world's largest river basins for many thousands of years, and 
      utilise the water flows for irrigation and navigation. In the last century 
      hydropower and municipal and industrial water supply have also become 
      reasons for the regulation and or abstraction of water flow in rivers.</P>
      <P>Today China is at a crossroads in water and energy development. This is 
      in respect to selecting the way forward to achieve sustainable development 
      and in making strategic choices among the different visions of regional 
      development. Among the factors that have enter the discussion within 
      China's of it strategic options for future water resource development and 
      management include: the apparent increasing severity of the effects of 
      flooding and drought and implications for the economy, and threat to lives 
      and livelihood; growing scarcity of surface and ground water resources in 
      many regions, and growing competition for available resources; net losses 
      of agriculture lands with encroachment by urbanisation, soil erosion and 
      loss; and, changing social development priorities centring on concerns 
      over the displacement impacts of large infrastructure projects. Finally 
      there is growing understanding concern over the progressively 
      deteriorating state of the environment including land, water and air 
      quality and the ecosystem effects as well as the longer term viability of 
      water resource projects.</P>
      <P>Recently China has been undergoing two major, interrelated 
      transformations that have a profound influence on all aspects of life in 
      the PRC. These transformations also underlay changes in patterns of demand 
      for water and energy services, and influence decision-making on water and 
      energy sector and broader development programmes. They also shape views of 
      what sustainable development actually means, and the priorities for 
      management of existing infrastructure and the evolving legal and 
      institutional arrangements. The first is the accelerated pace of 
      transformation from a rural agrarian society to a more urbanised 
      industrial society. At present China is just over 30% urban. With current 
      trends China is projected to be up to 60% urban by 2050. Increasingly the 
      demand will be concentrated in larger urban centers. One indication of 
      this trend is that agriculture GDP fell to less than 20% of overall GDP in 
      the mid 1990's. The second major transformation is the shift from a 
      centrally planned to a socialist market economy. These transitions broadly 
      have led to, or promise to lead to, greater openness and a devolution of 
      centralised control with the adoption of more localised decision-making 
      and reliance on market forces, in a socialist political context.</P>
      <P>There is evidence of a more open debate in the People's Republic of 
      China which is similar to the debate occurring world-wide on the future 
      direction of water and energy resource development and the rate of 
      progress in addressing problems that remain from the past. It is more 
      specifically focused on the role that dams and non-dam alternatives may 
      play, and the choices that are made among them either as complementary or 
      mutually exclusive means of achieving sought after sustainable development 
      outcomes, recognising the very unique circumstances in China and special 
      challenges that it faces.</P>
      <P>China's physical situation as regard to water and energy resource 
      development is somewhat unique in world terms, for many reasons - 
      including those of the sheer scale and magnitude of the challenges it 
      faces in providing water and energy services for over 1.2 billion 
      citizens. To date, in attempting to do so, it has built almost half of the 
      world's estimated 45,000 large dams. And China remains one of the most 
      active dams building countries today. Dams have and continue to be built 
      for flood management, irrigation power and water supply and enjoy 
      considerable political and institutional support. In doing so China has 
      also been involved in the displacement of more people and the alterations 
      of more rivers than any other society.</P>
      <P>Over 22,000 of the estimate 85,000 significant reservoirs and dams in 
      China are considered as large dams, though there are perhaps a few million 
      small-scale and localised water diversions, check dams and weirs built by 
      local collectives or individual farmers that are unrecorded. China has 
      thus built more the three times the number of large dams than the USA and 
      over five times the number in India. Virtually all these dams were built 
      since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, as only 22 
      large dams apparently existed before that time. What is remarkable is that 
      this was undertaken in parallel with the construction of many thousands of 
      km of dykes, levees, retention basins, pumping schemes and other schemes 
      on China's river systems.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>A considerable portion of China's inventory of large dams were actually 
      built in the 1950's and 1960's. Thus while China is adding to its 
      inventory of large dams, much of China's existing infrastructure for 
      large-scale water and energy resource projects is ageing. The management 
      of existing dams is seen to be increasingly important, not only because of 
      the numbers, but for reasons of safety, restoration, modernisation and 
      adapting operating practices to the circumstances of today. The 
      optimisation of existing dams and reservoirs in the context of an 
      integrated basin development plan is also seen to be an essential way 
      forward to address cumulative impacts and reconcile competing demands for 
      water between nature and human activities that are increasing and have in 
      some basins such as the Yellow River reached critical thresholds. There is 
      also growing concern about the risk and uncertainty of climate change, 
      where river basin management practices and development planning will have 
      to take into account likely changes in the flow regimes of China's 
      rivers.</P>
      <P>The Chinese circumstances and debate links to international concern for 
      water and land use and sustainable development more generally. The limited 
      availability of water and of land suitable for agriculture is recognised 
      as being the greatest challenges facing humankind in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> 
      century. In China as in other parts of the world opportunities for tapping 
      unused water resources or finding unused land suitable for agriculture are 
      increasingly limited. The option of damming more rivers for water and 
      ploughing grasslands or cutting forests to provide land for agriculture 
      has come under increased scrutiny.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The issues are particularly acute in China because of the rising 
      standard of living of many of its 1.2 billion people, and China after the 
      devastating experience of the Cultural Revolution is particularly aware of 
      the need to ensure adequate food supplies for its population. Food 
      security remains a national priority. Nonetheless, with past approaches in 
      water resources development and current management practices major river 
      systems are drying up, groundwater aquifers are increasingly over 
      exploited, water pollution is becoming a major concern and competition for 
      water between communities, sectors of the economy and between provinces is 
      growing. The situation is not uniform throughout the country. Some regions 
      are water stressed while other suffer from excess water in the form of 
      flood and waterlogged soils. New strategies for meeting the human need for 
      water supply and food production thus have to be found in China, perhaps 
      more than in many other part of the world. The use of water and land must 
      be carefully and strategically planned, efficiency of use optimised, 
      infrastructure modernised and financial resources and its highly educated 
      and capable human resources redirected to achieve this. China cannot avoid 
      making far reaching strategic decisions related to its land and water 
      resources and must address many challenges in doing so.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of water resources 
      development in the People's Republic of China (PRC), and background 
      information on the benefits and concerns of large dams. This is to provide 
      an input to the WCD process on the issues around the development 
      effectiveness of dams worldwide. This paper identifies and examines some 
      of the strategic challenges China faces in its water and energy resource 
      development plans and programmes; as well as the policy, legal, 
      institutional framework that is evolving for decision-making. The paper 
      also looks at the environmental and social issues and the scope and 
      challenges for integrated river basin planning and management that are 
      increasingly highlighted in policy statements, but otherwise appear to be 
      a very promising direction, but slowly emerging.</P>
      <P>Section 1 looks at the context of the dam debate in China and provides 
      a profile of its dam building programme and financing. Section 2 of the 
      paper then looks more closely at the land, water and energy resource 
      situation and challenges China faces in developing these resources. 
      Section 3 looks at the evolving development policy environment and the 
      legal, regulatory and institutional framework for water resources planning 
      and management. Section 4 considers the scope and potential for some of 
      the non-dam alternatives. It also provides a more in-depth illustration of 
      two specific strategic challenges that China faces by way of describing 
      how it is approaching flood management on the Yangtze river, and the water 
      scarcity problem in the North China plain where transbasin diversions are 
      now being considered. Section 5, looks at some of the issues and the 
      evolving practices in social and environmental management related to 
      resettlement and large dams.</P>
      <P>The Annexes to the paper provide general descriptions of three large 
      dams, and examines&nbsp; some of the controversies and the manner in which 
      the government is approaching the local and regional development issues, 
      as well as social and environmental challenges. These projects include the 
      Three Gorges project, the largest water and energy resource project in the 
      world (intended primarily for flood defence in the middle and lower 
      reaches of the Yangtze) and power generation, the Xiaolangdi project and 
      the Shuikou project. The Shuikou write-up focuses mainly on the 
      resettlement component of the project and suggests what is considered to 
      be emerging good practice in the implementation of China's resettlement

      critical views of China's water and energy management policies and 
      practices, particularly those on resettlement and environmental 
      management, to those supportive of the direction of China's evolving 
      policies, programmes and practices.</P><!--/ BODY TEXT --></FONT><!-- FOOTER -->
