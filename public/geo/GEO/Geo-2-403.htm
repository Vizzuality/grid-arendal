<H3>British Columbia Community Celebrates Designation of Clayoquot Sound as an 
International Biosphere Reserve</H3><!-- RELHEAD END --></FONT><!-- RELBODY START --><PRE>
    TOFINO, BC,  May 5 /CNW/ - Representatives of First Nations, local
governments, the Province of British Columbia, the Government of Canada, and
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
were joined by local residents and invited guests from around the world today
to officially commemorate the designation of Clayoquot Sound as a UNESCO
Biosphere Reserve.
    Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was in attendance to celebrate and announce
a $12 million endownment fund for the Clayoquot Biosphere Trust from which
income will be used to support research, education and training in the
Biosphere region.
    ``The designation of Clayoquot Sound as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is a
great honour for Canada,'' said Prime Minister Chrétien.  ``The spirit of
partnership and cooperation that brought together First Nations, local
communities and governments to achieve this designation is also eloquent
testimony to the inspirational power of this place of such wondrous beauty.
And it bespeaks our shared commitment to find innovative ways to promote
sustainable development.''
    ``Over the past decade, our government has worked successfully with the
communities of Clayoquot to promote diversification toward new forms of
economic development, while meeting our global obligation to protect this
world-renowned environmental treasure,'' said British Columbia Premier Ujjal
Dosanjh.  ``Local residents should be congratulated for their leadership and
their support for this transition towards a sustainable future in Clayoquot
Sound.''
    The Clayoquot Biosphere Trust, a new non-profit organization, made up of
First Nations and local communities of Clayoquot Sound, was recently
established as the cornerstone of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve to promote
research, education and training in the Clayoquot Sound region.  The mandate
of this partnership between local communities and First Nations is to reflect
the UNESCO Biosphere themes of protecting environmental values, promoting
sustainable economic development and supporting research, education and
training.
    The Alberni Clayoquot Regional District, the communities of Ucluelet and
Tofino and Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations fully support the UNESCO designation.
Last year, the nomination was put forth by First Nations and local government
to UNESCO, in partnership with federal and provincial governments.  First
Nations played a leading role in the development of the UNESCO proposal.
    ``All local communities - both First Nations and our neighbours - have
worked hard to make this designation become a reality,'' said Ucluelet First
Nation Chief Councillor Larry Baird, a member of the local Nomination Working
Group.  ``The real challenge, however, lies before us: to ensure that the
First Nations and local communities of the Clayoquot Biosphere region continue
to develop innovative ways to balance environmental considerations with
support for truly sustainable economic development.  The new motto for the
Clayoquot Biosphere Trust - `life in the balance' - captures the essence of
this challenge to us all.''
    The Clayoquot Sound UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is situated in the central
western region of Vancouver Island in British Columbia and covers an area of
about 3,500 square kilometers-approximately the size of Prince Edward Island.
The reserve encompasses a vast range of ecosystems, including large tracts of
temperate rainforest, many lakes, rivers and streams, alpine slopes, inshore
marine areas, mudflats and wild coastal beaches.  Core areas of the reserve
include the Long Beach Unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve and over
95,000 hectacres of provincial park.
    Maps of the area and Backgrounders are available upon request
