      <P>Northeast Asia is an excellent region in which to study environmental 
      conflict and cooperation. As a "latecomer" to environmental cooperation, 
      the states of Northeast Asia have the opportunity to learn from prior 
      regional experience. Northeast Asia also poses many challenges to 
      paradigms of environmental cooperation derived from other regions. As 
      regimes are forming only now, it is possible to study them at an early 
      stage to compare their structure, content, and driving variables with 
      environmental regimes found in other areas such as South Asia and the 
      Mediterannean. 
      <P>In Northeast Asia, there is almost no "habit of dialogue" on which to 
      draw for environmental cooperation, or even consensus on what constitutes 
      the region. The "region" itself contrasts with other regions in that it 
      contains the world's three greatest powers (the United States, China, and 
      Russia), as well as an economic superpower (Japan), and two small powers 
      (the two Koreas). Indeed, the states in the region that have been long 
      standing antagonists during the colonial era, World War II, the Korean 
      War, and the Cold War and regional hostilities continue in spite of the 
      end of bipolar confrontation between the United States and the former 
      Soviet Union. 
      <P>In addition, there are significant environmental problems in Northeast 
      Asia at a regional level (transboundary acid rain); environmental problems 
      and management issues that straddle one or more borders; as well as 
      radical differences in national institutional, economic and technological 
      capabilities with which to respond to national and international regional 
      imperatives. In section I, we describe these environmental problems. 
      <P>In section II, we describe and analyse the emerging regimes that 
      address this issues. These include UNEP's Northwest Pacific Action Plan or 
      NOWPAP, the IOC WESTPAC, the ESCAP/UNDP Northeast Asian Environment 
      Programme, and the UNDP Sub Regional Programme. 
      <P>These emerging regimes are driven partly by environmental imperatives; 
      partly by bureaucratic competition, and partly by leadership aspirations 
      for geopolitical or geoeconomic leadership, especially by smaller states 
      such as South Korea. There is no single regime at this time, but rather, a 
      series of emerging, overlapping regimes with different styles and 
      institutional implications. 
      <P>In section III, we addess five critical issues which arise from 
      consideration of these evolving environmental problems and emerging, 
      partial regimes in Northeast Asia, namely:<BR>capacity building; spillover 
      effects between environmental issues (especially from climate change); 
      monitoring and enforcement issues; financing; and, the importance of non 
      governmental organisations and public awareness. In conclusion, we frame a 
      set of questions for continuing research and analysis in light of what can 
      be learned from the Northeast Asian experience.

      Issues in Northeast Asia</B></FONT></A> 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, helvetica" size=2>In this section, we present brief 
      profiles of critical environmental issues which are amenable to regional 
      cooperation in Northeast Asia. These are: 
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Transfrontier air pollution (acid rain only); 
        <LI>Marine pollution (radionuclides and oil only); 
        <LI>Migratory animals (fisheries and birds only); 
        <LI>Trade-environment linkages (including forestry). 
        <LI></LI></UL>
      <P><B>1.1 Transfrontier Air Pollution</B> 
      <P>Transfrontier air pollution at a regional level in Northeast Asia 
      refers primarily to the "routine" atmospheric transport and deposition of 
      particulate matter emitted mostly in the course of energy production, 
      known as "acid rain.", 
      <P>High levels of sulphur emissions from coal burning power plants and 
      factories in China, North Korea and elsewhere in the region are the main 
      sources of acid rain. One study of China's largest coal-fired power plant 
      showed that sulphur dioxide concentrations frequently exceed the State's 
      permissible releases because the coal that is burned contains more than 
      two percent sulphur. However, even low sulphur coals can result in 
      absolutely and relatively high levels of sulphur dioxide emissions when 
      the coal is burned in inefficient plants. This acid rain may decrease 
      biomass productivity and thereby reduce its carbon uptake, and degrade 
      existing forests (and thereby cause the recipient country's carbon 
      emissions to increase). 
      <P>Many scientists believe that the Korean Peninsula and Japan suffer from 
      transfrontier acid rain originating upwind from Manchurian China. Some 
      have also noted that Mongolia may receive acid rain originating over its 
      northwestern border with Russia. Depending on the time of year, some 
      countries may be originators and recipients of acid rain, especially North 
      Korea. 
      <P>The precise scale and impact of transfrontier acid rain deposition 
      remains unclear, in part due to the lack of monitoring stations and 
      ecological studies. Initial studies indicate, however, that the levels of 
      acid rain may be on a par with Europe. China itself has noted the 
      possibility that acid rain may be transmitted long distances and has 
      seriously affected areas of China. In the area adjacent to the Yellow Sea, 
      Chinese industry has been estimated to emit about 700,000 tonnes of 
      sulphur dioxide per year, some of which could be transported across the 
      Yellow Sea to Korea by the predominantly northwesterly winds. 
      <P>In winter (January), the air flows are generally from the Asian land 
      mass to the ocean, while in summer (July), the opposite is the case. The 
      Asian Development Bank has mapped the likely geographical distribution of 
      acid rain by using regional sulphur dioxide emissions and regional 
      atmospheric circulation as proxies to suggest where acid rain may occur. 
      Acid conditions (that is, low pH values such as 4.5) occur in Japan and 
      southern China; elsewhere, pH values are much higher., The ADB-supported 
      regional investigation of acid rain suggests that Northeast China, Japan 
      and the two Koreas are relatively vulnerable to acid rain deposition, 
      especially in winter, due to the combination of high deposition, and 
      sensitive soils, vegetation, and materials. 
      <P>Fortunately, the problem is amenable to technological controls at 
      source, at a cost. A modern power plant with glue-gas desulphurisation 
      equipment can remove more than 90 percent of the emissions with ease. 
      <P>Also, countries in the region are moving to establish the requisite 
      monitoring of acid rain deposition. South Korea, for example, maintains a 
      network of 65 acid rain monitoring sites and is opening new sites on the 
      southwest coast and on Cheju Island in the near future. The National 
      Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan has convened a number of 
      regional workshops on acid rain (the last one was held in January 27-29, 
      1993 in Tsukuba City and was to estimate an inventory of pollution and to 
      determine regional monitoring protocols for acid rain, especially for SOx 
      and NOx. Much remains to be done in terms of establishing common 
      monitoring methodologies, comprehensive baseline monitoring, and ecosystem 
      impact studies. 
      <P><B>1.2 Marine Pollution</B>
      <P>Marine pollution occurs in an area of overlapping and contended 
      maritime jurisdictions, hindering and complicating joint environmental 
      management. East Asian seas are also semi-enclosed and therefore 
      particularly subject to the effects of chemical pollutants including 
      hydrocarbons, heavy metals, industrial and agricultural chemicals, 
      radionuclides, sewage, heat wastes, and many other materials. The 
      resultant ecological and economic damage includes commercial losses from 
      fisheries and aquaculture, destruction of flora and fauna, tourism, red 
      tides, etc. For reasons of brevity, we focus here on just one area of the 
      region's seas, the Sea of Japan. 
      <P>Undoubtedly, the most important sources of marine pollution in the Sea 
      of Japan are: 
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Coastal (urban, industrial, port and riverine) in-flows 
        <LI>Shipping and industrial waste dumping at sea 
        <LI>Radioactive waste disposal 
        <LI>Oil exploration and transport. </LI></UL>
      <P>The projected economic growth of Northeast Asia implies that all of 
      these sources could grow exponentially, while the assimilative capacity of 
      the ocean may be stretched to its limit- -or beyond. In the future, 
      exploitation of seabed minerals may increase the stress on marine 
      environments. In this section, we will address only two dimensions of 
      chemical pollution, namely, the radioactive and oil-related pollution 
      issues in the Sea of Japan. 
      <P><B>1.2.1 Radioactive Waste Dumping:</B> In early 1993, Russia admitted 
      that the former Soviet Union had dumped civilian and military radioactive 
      wastes for decades in the Sea of Japan, in contravention of domestic and 
      international laws. 
      <P>The total quantity of radioactive materials involved in this activity 
      was relatively small compared with other radioactive pollution in the same 
      period. However, the Russian activity was significant because it related 
      to legal precedent and the integrity of the London Dumping Convention 
      which precludes signatories from engaging in such wanton dumping. It also 
      highlighted the possibility of additional uncontrolled radioactive 
      pollution of the Sea of Japan arising from Russia's military and reactors 
      operating in the Far East. 
      <P>Russia's nuclear submarines lack funds and facilities to remove old 
      fuel rods, let alone install new rods. Russia's military forces are unable 
      to deal with the radioactive legacy of the Cold War. It is urgent to 
      remove the nuclear reactors and fuel from decommissioned nuclear powered 
      warships, especially submarines, for safe storage and disposal. To end 
      Russian dumping of low- and high-level wastes at the four sites in the 
      Seas of Japan (and Okhotsk), interim storage facilities on Russian 
      territory must be located and constructed. Other states in the region have 
      complementary capabilities. Japan, for example, has significant experience 
      in decommissioning its former nuclear powered ships. 
      <P><B>1.2.2 Oil Pollution:</B> The monitoring of chemical pollution such 
      as oil in the Sea of Japan is conducted at an existing network of stations 
      which measure pollution three times (or more) per year. Standard 
      techniques are used which establish the distribution of pollutants and 
      their relationship to hydrometeorological conditions. This joint 
      monitoring effort has been underway since 1989, and involved joint North 
      Korean-Soviet expeditions into the Sea of Japan in 1989-90. 
      <P>On the basis of one measure of oil pollution--average levels of 
      dissolved hydrocarbons--the open areas of the Sea of Japan contain about 
      1.5-1.8 more oil than that of the surface waters of the northwestern 
      Pacific ocean. In coastal regions of the Sea of Japan, the level of 
      pollution is much higher, often at 2.5 times the level of unpolluted ocean 
      waters, and even exceeding maximum permissible concentrations on a 
      permanent basis (for example, at the Russia's Golden Horn Bay). Another 
      measure of oil pollution--the concentration of tarballs in the ocean 
      water--ranges from 0.15-1 mg/m3. The concentration is high along sealanes, 
      especially south of Honshu. The prevailing winds concentrate the tarballs 
      in different parts of the Sea of Japan, depending on the season. Japan 
      reports that overall, tar balls drifting or cast ashore since 1975 has 
      fallen since 1985, but increased in 1990 in areas of southern Honshu, Sea 
      of Japan, and western Kyushu. 
      <P>The rate of marine oil spills appears to be increasing. South Korea, 
      for example, reports a near doubling in the spill rate and a near tripling 
      in the spill volume for recorded spills along its coast (see Table 1.1). 
      Major oil spills have occurred, including the sinking of a tanker in 
      February 1988 which damaged 2,000 hectares of marine aquaculture at 
      Youngil Bay; and a tanker collision in July 1990 which released 1.5 
      million liters of bunker C oil. In August 1993, a tanker collided with 
      another ship off Pusan and spilled 225 tonnes of bunker oil in a nine mile 
      long slick that threatened South Korea's most popular beaches. 
      <P>Models of oil pollution dispersal show that oil slicks in the Sea of 
      Japan could move onto adjacent coastal regions or move out into the open 
      seas, depending on tides and winds. Data is needed on estimated spill 
      rates and number of spills per volume of oil produced or handled, and mean 
      or median size of spills for the East Asian region and Sea of Japan to 
      facilitate analysis of the risks of oil pollution, whether from offshore 
      oil production, coastal refining facilities and ports, or from tankers in 
      sea lanes. Research is also needed on 1) the physical fate of oil on 
      surface waters, in the water column, and on bottom sediments; 2) the 
      biological effects on fish, shellfish, seabirds, shorebirds and waterfowl; 
      on seasonal primary, secondary and benthic productivity; and 3), on 
      economic damage including cleanup costs. 
      <P>Prevention of marine pollution is not yet a major environmental issue 
      in the littoral states for the Sea of Japan. However, cooperation to 
      reduce and control marine pollution could foster a dialogue on the 
      overarching issue of managing holistically an oceanic ecosystem between 
      parties who disagree on territorial boundaries and who are divided over 
      the best way to manage fisheries stocks on a sustainable basis. 
      <P>These latter problems can hinder the development of collaborative 
      approaches to reducing marine pollution because the legal status of 
      semi-enclosed oceans remains ambiguous under customary law and the Law of 
      the Seas. As Mark Valencia puts it: 
      <P>
      <UL><I>The most successful efforts to deal with marine environmental 
        problems are carefully nurtured with simultaneous institution-building, 
        scientific, and treaty-drafting activities at the regional level, but 
        this can come about only with strong and sustained littoral state 
        support. </I></UL>
      <P>The multiple environmental problems that afflict the Sea of Japan--all 
      of which involve multiple economic sectors and overlapping jurisdictions, 
      and all of which are linked to marine pollution--entail a complex 
      cooperative management scheme with very wide scope. 
      <P>A first step must be to obtain scientifically valid data on pollution 
      levels. Achieving this goal requires the use of sophisticated research 
      equipment. As it is available in sufficient amounts and quality only in 
      Japan and South Korea, the first step to controlling marine pollution in 
      the Sea of Japan must be a joint effort to achieve a comprehensive and 
      complete regional monitoring program to determine its ecological status. 
      Valencia has argued that regional cooperation would be useful to 
      intercalibrate measuring methods; to determine indicator species; to study 
      the biogeochemical flows of pollutants at the river/ocean, water/sediment, 
      and air/water interfaces; to monitor dump sites for dredged materials; and 
      to automate the collection and analysis of data. 
      <P>Russia has proposed that a regional center be established to expand the 
      marine pollution observation system, to conduct joint research expeditions 
      in the Japan and Yellow Seas, and to set up a data base on marine 
      environmental quality, a proposal which the Republic of Korea has also 
      made. The Republic of Korea has also suggested that an international 
      agreement for prevention of marine pollution in the region should be 
      concluded and that a regional oil spill contingency plan be established to 
      respond to accidental releases.

        <P></P></UL><B>1.3 Migratory Animals-Fish and Birds</B>
      <P>In this section, we describe the basic dilemmas involved with joint 
      management of migratory fish and bird species in East Asia. For reasons of 
      space, we do not address the issue of trade in endangered species, nor the 
      preservation of critical habitats (especially transborder areas) although 
      these are all important environmental priorities for regional action. 
      <P><B>1.3.1 Migratory Fish: </B>In terms of tonnage produced, the north 
      Pacific is the most important fishing region in the world. In 1984, for 
      example, 32 per cent of the world catch came from the north Pacific, of 
      which almost 90 percent was caught in the northwest Pacific. Regional 
      states are highly dependent on this produce. Japan and the two Koreas 
      derive about 90 percent of their respective catches from the region, and 
      Russia and China about 30 and 10 percent respectively. An acute problem 
      associated with high seas fisheries in the northwest Pacific and East 
      Asian seas is that of straddling and highly migratory stocks, that is, 
      species such as tuna and many kinds of groundfish and pelagic fish which 
      migrate between the high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of 
      states, and between EEZs. Indeed, the majority of the fish now exploited 
      by countries adjacent to the East Asian Seas are shared stocks. 
      <P>A regional approach may be appropriate for jointly managing the 
      fisheries of the enclosed seas of Japan and Okhotsk and adjacent coastal 
      areas. Fishery agreements are bilateral and exist between Russia and 
      Japan, and Russia and North Korea on the one hand; and between Japan and 
      South Korea, and Japan and North Korea on the other. (A number of these 
      agreements are non governmental). The agreements establish a delicately 
      balanced set of reciprocal fishing rights with catch quotas, and specify 
      that scientific and technical consultations should be held. In some cases, 
      joint regulatory zones are prescribed as to number and size of trawlers, 
      types of gear, dates of operation, and catch. 
      <P>None of these agreements is region-wide and no regional fora exist in 
      which to discuss allocation of catch. Thus, the management regime does not 
      correspond to the inherently widely distributed and mobile fisheries 
      resource. Consequently, a number of stocks are severely depleted. 
      Unilateral actions to exploit or to manage the fishery stocks have even 
      increased tensions between states--as occurred most recently between 
      Russia, Japan, Poland and South Korea over the pollock stocks in the Sea 
      of Okhotsk. Nor have larger regional or global agreements proven adequate 
      to the task, as membership of the International North Pacific Fisheries 
      Commission is limited to Japan, Canada and the United States. 
      <P>Some experts have proposed a Northwest Pacific approach relating to the 
      Seas of Japan and Okhotsk that would avoid finalising the jurisdictional 
      issues raised by the Law of the Seas and other territorial disputes, but 
      would incrementally modify existing arrangements; 
      <P>create regional non governmental arrangements; and establish a regional 
      scientific organisation. Although it would require some 
      leadership--possibly by Japan or Russian fishery organisations--such an 
      approach would build on existing bilateral agreements to secure 
      information on coastal fisheries, especially in relation to collection of 
      statistics, scientific research, depicting shared stocks, and identifying 
      overfishing. An informal, consultative regional forum on fisheries issues 
      along with related fields of maritime ecology, pollution, law, and 
      security may also be productive. 
      <P><B>1.3.2 Migratory Birds: </B>The wetlands of Northeast Asia support 
      over 150 species of waterbird., including ducks, geese, and cranes. Twenty 
      seven of these are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red Data Book, and 
      some are nearly extinct. Pressures on these birds include the loss of 
      wetland habitats for nesting, feeding, and migratory stopover to urban, 
      agricultural and coastal development, hunting, and pollution. 
      <P>In Japan, for example, nearly 40 percent of its 32,170 km of coastline 
      have been modified heavily. The total area of mudflats (beaches, 
      estuaries, and lagoons) fell from 82,621 to 53,856 hectares between 1945 
      and 1989. 
      <P>Migratory cranes symbolize these exterminative pressures. They migrate 
      over a variety of routes in and across Northeast Asia. White-naped cranes, 
      for example, have been tracked by satellite flying from Izumi in Japan, to 
      stopover points in South Korea, on the Korean DMZ, North Korea, Russia, 
      and China. 
      <P>In both Koreas, planned reclamation of estuaries, shallow bays, and 
      inter-tidal mudflats threaten huge areas of highly productive coastal 
      habitat. One study for South Korea anticipates the loss of 65 percent of 
      total coastal wetlands if development plans are implemented. Massive 
      coastal reclamation and river modification is also underway in North 
      Korea, with little consideration to the impact on migratory species. 
      <P>Non governmental organisations and official research institutes have 
      created a strong network of projects to band and to monitor the annual 
      migration of birds such as the cranes. 
      <P>The Wild Bird Society of Japan, for example, has worked closely with 
      Chinese and Russian counterparts; and attended a DPRK-Japan symposium on 
      migratory bird conservation in 1987 during which both countries agreed to 
      participate in banding projects on Chinese Egrets. Multiple bilateral 
      treaties between countries in Northeast Asia have been signed and 
      implemented in the past decade. In 1994, South Korea proposed a regional, 
      multilateral treaty to protect migratory birds and their habitats for 
      consideration by the six states engaged in the Northeast Asia 
      Environmental Program. 
      <P><B>1.4 Sustainable Forest Development</B> 
      <P>Within the parameters of the Northeast Asian region lie the world's 
      most extensive remaining forests--and some of the largest and 
      fastest-growing appetites for timber. Extending from the Urals to the 
      Pacific coast and from the Chinese and Mongolian borders to the Arctic, 
      Siberia cover 1280 million hectares, which is about 30% larger than the 
      continental United States. About half of this area is covered with 
      forests, covering about 20% of the world's forested area and nearly 50% of 
      the world coniferous area. 
      <P>The forests of Siberia offer not only potential for human economic 
      development; they also provide important ecological services to Russia, 
      the Northeast Asian region and the world as a whole. These services 
      include habitat for flora and fauna, many of which are endemic. The Far 
      Eastern regions of Primorski and Khabarovski Krais contain a bio- 
      diversity "hot spots" which contain a rare combination of flora and fauna 
      species found in northern and southern regions of the earth. The Siberian 
      tiger, for example, is the only tiger found in a northern climate. Another 
      global service is carbon sequestration. According to one estimate, 40 
      billion tons of carbon are stored in Siberian forests, providing a 
      safeguard against global warming. 
      <P>The Far Eastern part of Siberia contains some of the most valuable and, 
      until recently, least accessible and utilised of Siberia's forest 
      resources. In 1988, the Russian Far East accounted for 65% of Soviet 
      forest land, 66% of the nation's mature and over-mature timber, and 80% of 
      the unstocked forest land. Until recently, however, much of the area was 
      considered inaccessible for timber use. About 53% of Far Eastern timber 
      was considered to be currently or potentially accessible in 1988. 
      <P>With little domestic processing capability, Russia's forest exports 
      center primarily on raw logs. The primary exports markets are in Asia, 
      especially Japan and China and increasingly South Korea. With a large, 
      domestic timber processing industry, Japan is the world's largest importer 
      of raw logs. In 1989, Japan accounted for 52% of total world imports of 
      saw and veneer logs, up from 43% in 1965. Russia's forest product exports 
      are primarily logs and Japan is its largest market. Nearly 55% of total 
      Soviet Union log exports were to Japan in 1988. With China accounting for 
      another 26%, Northeast Asian countries were the destination for 81% of 
      Soviet log exports. South Korea is also increasing its demand for Russian 
      Far East timbers, suggesting an even greater role for regional markets. 
      <P>Russian forests, including in the Far East, suffered poor management 
      practices during the Soviet era, creating waste of forest resources. One 
      study published in 1988 found that: ...the best stands are cut, the rest 
      are left in a confusing array of cut and uncut stands unprofitable for 
      further exploitation, trimmings and trunks are ignored, scrap suitable for 
      processing is burned needlessly, and logging enterprises are prematurely 
      shutdown. Of the 400 million cubic meters harvested annually, 160 million 
      cubic meters are lost in various stages of production; only 51 percent 
      reaches the consumer and only 8 percent of the remainder (scrap) utilised 
      anywhere. 
      <P>Poor management practices, including insufficient reforestation, 
      undermined the longterm ecological sustainability of the forest 
      eco-systems and therefore, of the forest as an economic resource. In the 
      cold and humid climate of the Russian Far East, forest stands grow and 
      regenerate slowly and ecosystems are not highly resilient to change. 
      Without careful and selective cutting and adequate reforestation efforts, 
      cut forest-lands can become swamplands. In drier parts of the world, 
      excessive or inappropriate logging can generate or exacerbate a process of 
      desertification. In the Russian taiga, the analogous process is one of 
      "swampification." 
      <P>Clearcutting was the primary form of logging during the Soviet era. 
      Moreover, reforestation rates were too low to support regeneration. 
      Natural regeneration was insufficient due to "inappropriate logging 
      methods destroying the undergrowth, inadequate assistance of natural 
      regeneration, and inefficient forest fire protection." While some 
      reforestation were undertaken, the overall rate of reforestation was low. 
      According to one estimate, reforestation rates in Siberia should be 20-50 
      percent greater than the level of the early 1990s. 
      <P>The period of the Russian Federation has not improved either logging 
      practices or reforestation rates. Indeed, the collapse of central 
      authority, the economic crisis in the Far East, and the new openness to 
      foreign investment, including in the forestry sector, have worsened the 
      prospects for sustainable forest development in the Far East. In a highly 
      contentious and internationally known case, the South Korean company 
      Hyundai was confronted by a coalition of environmentalists and indigenous 
      people seeking to stop clearcutting in the Bikin River Watershed area. 
      Despite promises to do so, Hyundai apparently undertook no reforestation 
      efforts. It also conducted clearcutting rather than selective logging 
      operations. 
      <P>Rapid growth in China is fuelling increased demand for Siberian forest 
      timbers. The total trade to China is not fully accounted for in national 
      statistics, since timber is sold via South Korea traders based in the 
      United States. Demand from Japan and South Korea is also increasing as 
      traditional timber sources in the Northwest of the United States are 
      reduced for conservation reasons. One detailed study of Russian timber 
      sources both concluded and predicted that the forest industry in the 
      Russian Far East "must in addition to domestic and other internal 
      demand...also meet the export requirements of the Pacific Basin." 
      <P>To meet the development demands of the region while maintaining the 
      integrity of the forest eco-system, a sustainable forest management regime 
      must be created in Northeast Asia. Regional cooperation is needed in three 
      broad areas: i) to help build administrative and regulatory capacities in 
      the Russian Far East; ii) to create regional Forest Codes of Conduct for 
      foreign investors in forest operations; and iii) to manage and reduce the 
      growth in regional timber demand. Cooperation would also help to transfer 
      better forestry technologies and to manage forest fires, including across 
      the China-Russia and China-Mongolia border. 
      <P><B>1.5 Regional Economic Integration and the Environment</B>
      <P>The countries of Northeast Asia are increasingly interested in 
      prospects for regional economic cooperation. Interest stems from three 
      sources. First, the end of the Cold War has softened bilateral hostilities 
      and nurtured bilateral commercial relations, including between China and 
      South Korea, China and Japan, and Russia and all its Northeast Asian 
      neighbours. Second, the collapse of the Soviet Union abruptly cut off the 
      supply line to the Russian Far East from European Russia. Economic 
      necessity sparked a new Russian openness to trade and investment by 
      Chinese, Korean and Japanese firms and families. Third, the national 
      economies of the region are characterized by differing and potentially 
      complementary economic capabilities. Japan and South Korea have 
      technological and financial strengths, China has a large and literate 
      labor force, and Mongolia, the Russian Far East, and North Korea have a 
      large base of primary resources, including forests and minerals. 
      <P>Political and economic factors are generating momentum toward regional 
      economic integration. Intra-regional trade apparently increased steadily 
      throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The precise extent of intra-regional 
      trade cannot be ascertained, since data are hard to obtain and are 
      unreliable. According to one estimate, the (money) value of intra-regional 
      trade among five Northeast Asian nations increased by 225 percent between 
      1981 and 1989, while the volume of world trade increased by only 160 
      percent. Increasing trade between China and South Korea and China and 
      Russia in the past three years suggest even more rapid growth. 
      Intra-regional trade accounted for 10.8 percent of total world trade in 
      1989. 
      <P>Although the absolute level of trade interdependence is still low, it 
      is growing. Most important, it is growing despite the lack of government 
      agreements or policies of the sort that promoted European economic 
      integration. In this, it resembles the rest of Asia-Pacific, where 
      economic integration has been driven by markets, national policies, and 
      bilateral agreements, rather than regional policies. 
      <P>Intra-regional trade figures mask the importance of several bilateral 
      trade relationships in the region, especially between Japan-South Korea 
      and Japan-China. Exports to Japan, for example, accounted for 14.5% of all 
      Chinese exports in 1992, while imports from Japan comprised 17.9% of total 
      imports. South Korea is likewise heavily integrated with Japan: imports 
      accounted for 23.8% of total South Korean imports in 1992, while exports 
      to Japan comprised 15.1% of total exports. Indeed, Japan is by far the 
      most important trading power in the region, with its trade with South 
      Korea and China accounting for almost 70% of the total trade in Northeast 
      Asia. Trade between China and South Korea is also significant and growing, 
      although it remains unofficial and thus unaccounted for. 
      <P>Intra-regional trade figures are typically derived from national trade 
      statistics. A more meaningful gauge of regional economic integration would 
      be obtained by data disaggregated at the provincial level. According to 
      one Chinese study, the Northeast provinces of China including Heilongiang, 
      Jilin, Liaoning and Tianjin export 44% of their total exports to other 
      countries in Northeast Asia. In the Russian Far East, Chinese imports of 
      textiles have surged since borders were relaxed in the early 1990s. 
      According to a leading Russian economist, living standards Russia's 
      Khabarovskii Krai would drop by 30% if imports were cut off. 
      <P>Economic integration suggests that there are benefits in regional 
      cooperation in managing links between trade and environmental policy and 
      more broadly between economic and environmental policy. It also suggests 
      that there are both environmental and economic costs in not doing so. The 
      costs stem from two directions. On the economic side, a patchwork of 
      national environmental policies increases the transactions costs of trade. 
      Exporters, importers and investors must spend time and money first gaining 
      information about second conforming to different national regulations. 
      Costs of enforcement are also likely to be higher with a variety of 
      national regulatory frameworks, especially if there are fundamental 
      differences of philosophy and social objectives. 
      <P>On the environmental side, regional trade integration accelerates 
      economic growth, increasing demands for resource inputs and ecological 
      services. China's GNP, for example, is growing at the rate of around 12% 
      per year. Unless accelerated growth occurs within resource management 
      policies which internalize environmental costs and stay within absolute 
      ecological limits, it will accelerate environmental degradation and 
      resource depletion. 
      <P>Except for transboundary open-access resources, such policies could be 
      left to national governments alone. If all nations undertook sound 
      national environmental management, there would be no problems of 
      resource-depleting growth or the cross-border issues, such as air 
      pollution, which flow from it. 
      <P>Economic integration, however, both reflects and intensifies pressures 
      to be competitive in regional markets. Intense competition for export 
      markets, resources and foreign investment can lower or retard the raising 
      of environmental standards. In Northeast Asia, a "pollution haven" or 
      "resource extraction haven" strategy may be especially attractive to 
      nations seeking to woo Japanese companies facing increasingly stringent 
      domestic environmental regulations (as well as rising labor costs); or 
      seeking foreign investment in the exploitation of forest, mineral and 
      ocean resources. Common regimes also enhance the strength of monitoring 
      and enforcement of environmental regulations. 
      <P>The need to promote environmentally sound regional trade patterns does 
      not necessarily suggest the retardation of processes of trade 
      liberalization and regional integration. Trade openness itself can help to 
      improve environmental management, in part because trade and foreign 
      investment act as a transmission belt for regulatory standards, as well as 
      technology transfer. Countries with the largest markets, most advanced 
      technologies, and foreign investment funds (and foreign aid) tend to be 
      the pace-setters for the regionally integrated countries. If product 
      standards are low in the large-market country, they will pull regional 
      standards down. On the other hand, if environmental standards in the 
      region's largest markets are high, trade will pull national standards up. 
      <P>Japan is by far the largest market and source of foreign investment in 
      Northeast Asia. South Korea and Taiwan are also important investors and 
      traders. All three countries tend to s high sanitary and health product 
      standards for imports. However, the region's most important regional 
      environmental problems stem not from the use of products from the 
      processes of their production or harvesting. Countries do not regulate 
      foreign production processes of imported products. Indeed, they are barred 
      by GATT from doing so. 
      <P>Establishing common environmental process and product standards would 
      reduce the transactions cost of trade and set a common floor for 
      environmental management. However, the countries of the region differ 
      greatly in terms of types and demands on ecosystems, levels of economic 
      development, political systems, and (potentially) social preferences. 
      Ecological diversity suggests that appropriate standards be set at the 
      ecosystem level, rather than regional, national or even provincial. 
      <P>The primary challenge facing Northeast Asia, or any other region 
      undergoing a process of economic integration, is two-fold: first, how to 
      develop a common regional framework for environmental management in the 
      face of ecological and social diversity at national and sub-national 
      levels; second, how to manage specific issues arising from trade- 
      environment links in the context of broad regional trade-environment 
      agreements. 
      <P>Three innovative approaches to regional trade-environment cooperation 
      could help to meet the challenge: i) harmonizing standard-setting 
      methodologies; ii) enacting Environmental Sectoral Agreements; and iii) 
      developing common Environmental Guidelines for Development Planning. 
      Standard-Setting Methodologies: The need for diversity-within-commonality 
      might be approached by seeking to harmonize not environmental standards 
      per se but the methodologies by which standards are set. Examples are 
      Environment Impact Assessment systems and Health and Environmental Risk 
      Assessment and Ordering Methodologies. Environmental Resource Agreements: 
      The need to manage specific trade-environment issues could be addressed by 
      developing Sectoral Environmental Agreements, especially for primary 
      resource-intensive sectors such as agriculture, tourism and forest 
      products. Such Agreements would aim not to manipulate prices but to 
      establish common policy frameworks. In agriculture, for example, common 
      policies could be developed to govern the use of input subsidies, zoning 
      regulations, reporting and labelling requirements, including for 
      pesticides, crop rotation requirements, etc. Another innovation might be a 
      Farm Licensing System: farmers would need to show that they had a 
      Sustainable Management Plan as a condition for obtaining a license to 
      farm. Such a system would allow for diversity not just between nations but 
      between individual farms. While broad guidelines and principles would be 
      specified, farmers would be able to implement them according to the 
      particular conditions of their own farm/locale. 
      <P>Environmental Guidelines for Development Planning: Environmental 
      guidelines for development planning aim to provide a framework in which to 
      manage economic growth. Guidelines could encompass issues such as 
      integrated land use planning; infrastructure requirements for projected 
      growth in local industries and population, including energy, water and 
      sewage; and integrated industry mix/eco-system planning. 
      <P>Regional cooperation in establishing such Environmental Guidelines 
      would promote learning and build management capacities among member 
      countries. Setting the Guidelines in common would help to reduce 
      cross-border pollution and act to provide a higher common floor for 
      environmental management in the region. 
      <P>Plans for joint development of the Tumen River area may offer a pilot 
      project for developing regional Environmental Guidelines. The 
      UNDP-sponsored Tumen River Area Development Project calls for 
      infrastructure and industry development along the Tumen River delta area 
      extending from Chongjin, North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia and inland to 
      Yanji, China (see Map 3.1). The Project has five members: China, the 
      Russian Federation, Mongolia, South Korea, and North Korea. Still in a 
      formative stage, the vision for the Project is reflected in a recent 
      "master plan" report to the UNDP: 
      <P>
      <OL>A convenient, reliable, safe and cost-effective road, rail, air and 
        seaport transportation infrastructure along with water, waste treatment 
        and electrical energy will act as catalysts to facilitate trade and spur 
        population growth and industrial development. Providing adequate 
        utilities and improving transportation infrastructure for all modes to 
        provide convenient freight distribution and travel links worldwide is a 
        precondition to help transform the TREDA [Tumen River Economic 
        Development Area] into a major international shipping, trading and 
        manufacturing zone with a favourable investment climate. Such a climate 
        will attract potential foreign investors and accelerate economic growth 
        and prosperity. </OL>
      <P>Member countries have agreed to a set of Environmental Principles as 
      guideposts for the design of the Tumen River project. In October 1992, a 
      preliminary environmental assessment was presented to the Programme 
      Management Committee's second meeting. The report stated that the 
      hinterland, deltaic and adjacent coastal areas were ecologically fragile, 
      and noted the paucity of environmental and resource data for the area. 
      <P>In May 1993, the third meeting of the Programme Management Committee 
      reviewed a draft set of "Environmental Principles" with the following 
      objectives: 
      <P>
      <OL>A project goal will be to achieve "environmentally sound and 
        sustainable development" in accordance with UNCED, international 
        environmental law and agreements, and multilateral donor 
        requirements;<BR>Participating governments will cooperate and coordinate 
        with each other on environmental concerns and will be responsible for 
        preparing impact assessments of projects on national territory, but 
        coordination of environmental protection of projects developed within 
        the zone by the Tumen River Development Corporation will be the 
        responsibility of institutions developed to implement the 
        scheme.<BR>Member states will provide for non-governmental organisations 
        to participate in environmental assessment procedures. 
        <P></P></OL>However, very little ecosystem study or environmental 
      assessment has been undertaken, especially of the vast and ecologically 
      fragile wetland areas of the Tumen River delta. Without baseline 
      ecological data, it is not possible to design an environmentally 
      sustainable development plan. 
      <P>A draft Preliminary Environmental Study completed in May, 1994 
      constitutes the first stage of environmental assessment. The 
      UNDP-commissioned study concludes that the TREDA spans a region of 
      "globally significant biodiversity values" and "includes a wide range of 
      ecosystems, many of which are themselves regionally or globally 
      significant." It also suggests that the wetlands and marine environment of 
      Posiet Bay in the center of the coastal area of the zone are highly to 
      pollution. While existing levels of population and industry are apparently 
      not degrading this ecosystem, their expansion, the report concludes, "may 
      not be compatible with maintenance of the ecological, tourism and 
      mariculture values." 
      <P>Most significantly, the draft Environmental Study concludes that an 
      environmental assessment of the Tumen River Project is not "possible or 
      appropriate at this stage in the project because of the nature of the 
      project, the preliminary level of project definition and the lack of 
      coherent and reliable background information" (our emphasis). The Study 
      makes two recommendations. First, that regional strategic environmental 
      planning be undertaken "to identify appropriate and inappropriate 
      activities in specific environments." Second, that institutional and human 
      resource capacities be strengthened to "meet the challenges that will be 
      generated by TRADP." These include environmental quality control, 
      enhancement of environmental assessment capabilities and procedures, and 
      ecosystem and species management
      <P><A name=II><FONT face="Arial, helvetica" size=2><B>II. Environmental 
      Regimes in Northeast Asia</B></FONT></A> 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, helvetica" size=2>In this essay, we describe four 
      emerging regional environmental management regimes in Northeast Asia. 
      These include UNEP's Northwest Pacific Action Plan or NOWPAP, the IOC 
      WESTPAC, the ESCAP/UNDP Northeast Asian Environment Programme, and the 
      UNDP Sub Regional Programme. 
      <P><B>2.1 Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP)</B> 
      <P>The UNEP Regional Seas Programme was initiated in 1974 as a global 
      program implemented through regional components. At present, it comprises 
      of ten regions; three more regional programs (including NOWPAP) are under 
      development. Over one hundred and forty coastal states and territories 
      participate in the program. The divisions of the Cold War combined with 
      the non-membership of United Nations of the two Koreas blocked UNEP from 
      implementing a regional program in the Northwest Pacific. 
      <P>In May 1980, at the initiative of states bordering the semi-enclosed 
      seas of the Northwest Pacific, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) 
      Governing Council decided to prepare new action plans for seas not yet 
      covered by UNEP's Regional Seas Programme. In response, the littoral 
      states promptly nominated National Focal Points to develop the NOWPAP. 
      Officials from the six concerned states met informally in Nairobi in May 
      1991 at which time they reaffirmed their governments' willingness to 
      initiate the NOWPAP. Due to the wide range of early suggestions as the 
      content of the Action Plan, UNEP convened an early formal consultative 
      meeting in Vladivostok in October 1991 in conjunction with the Center for 
      International Projects and Pacific Oceanological Institute. Experts from 
      five national delegations (North Korea did not attend) reported on aspects 
      of the marine environment. The Japanese report addressed marine pollution 
      monitoring in adjacent seas of Japan and water quality management; the 
      former Soviet, Chinese, and South Korean reports dealt with fundamental 
      and applied marine pollution studies, pollution-related marine ecological 
      problems, and regional maritime pollution monitoring. 
      <P>The participants agreed that National Focal Points henceforth would 
      prepare national reports for future meetings. These reports are to cover 
      the status of the marine environment and coastal areas; national policies 
      and measures to deal with marine pollution; and proposals for steps to be 
      taken in a Regional Action Plan. They noted that regional cooperation in 
      response to a pollution emergency would be appropriate for joint 
      activities in the future. 
      <P>At the second meeting of experts and National Focal Points, held again 
      in Beijing in October 1992, all six countries were represented. At this 
      meeting, a consultant presented a draft Regional Action Plan which was 
      reviewed, and in some important respects, modified (at the insistence of 
      Japan, for example, that the section on Biodiversity and Ecological 
      Resources be deleted, which was agreed except for the section on wetland 
      reserves and genetic resources). 
      <P>The geographical area to be covered by the Action Plan is not entirely 
      clear. At the first meeting, the majority view was that it would cover 
      initially the marine environment and coastal areas of the Japan and Yellow 
      Seas, without prejudice to its possible future extension to cover 
      additional marine environment and coastal areas of participating states. 
      The delegates have also reserved their right to call the Sea of Japan by 
      different names. The 1993 meeting formally endorsed the following 
      definition of scope: 
      <P>
      <OL>[M]arine environment and the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan and 
        the Yellow Sea, which are generally considered as the area north of the 
        line between the mouth of the Changjiang River and Cheju-do Island, 
        without prejudice to its possible future extension to cover additional 
        marine environment and coastal areas of the participating countries as 
        may be determined at a later stage. </OL>
      <P>The fulcrum of regional programs is the Action Plan. The draft Action 
      Plan discussed at the November 1993 NOWPAP meeting in Bangkok. Most 
      fundamentally, the NOWPAP states committed themselves to: 
      <P>
      <OL>[W]ork towards the development of a regional convention for 
        protection and management of the coastal and marine environment and the 
        resources of the North- West Pacific region, and will explore the 
        formulation of appropriate protocols that could be adopted to formalize 
        the commitment to mutual cooperation, assistance and collaboration 
        especially in the case of emergencies (and the prevention of disposal of 
        radioactive waste at sea.) </OL>
      <P>The strategy for regional coastal and marine environmental management 
      accepted in Bangkok has five elements: the monitoring and assessment of 
      environmental conditions; creation of an efficient and effective 
      information base; integrated coastal area planning; integrated coastal 
      area management; and establishment of a collaborative and cooperative 
      legal framework. 
      <P>The draft NOWPAP Action Plan therefore concentrates on the short and 
      medium-term assembling the basic information needed for regional 
      management of coastal and marine resources. To that end, five objectives 
      were adopted for implementation upon finalisation of the Action Plan: 
      <P>
      <DL>
        <DD>(i) To assess regional marine environmental conditions by 
        coordinating and integrating monitoring and data gathering systems on a 
        regional basis, making the best use of the expertise and facilities 
        available within the region on a consistent and collective basis;
        <P>(ii) To collate and record environmental data and information to form 
        a comprehensive database and information management system which will 
        serve as a repository of all relevant, available data, act as the sound 
        basis for decision-making, and serve as a source of information and 
        education for specialists, administrators, and others; 
        <P>(iii) To develop and adopt a harmonious approach towards coastal and 
        marine environmental planning on an integrated basis, and in a 
        pre-emptive, predictive and precautionary manner;
        <P>(iv) To develop and adopt a harmonious approach towards the 
        integrated management of the coastal and marine environment and its 
        resources, in a manner which combines protection, restoration, 
        conservation and sustainable use;
        <P>(v) To develop and adopt a regional framework of legislative and 
        other agreements for mutual support in emergencies, collaboration in the 
        management of contiguous bodies of water, and cooperation in the 
        protection of common resources as well as in the prevention of coastal 
        and marine pollution. </P></DD></DL>
      <P>The activities and tasks contained in the Action Plan reflect these 
      objectives and focus on information gathering, resources and environmental 
      quality surveys, collation and exchange of information, and collaborative 
      research. 
      <P>Given the pre-existing hostilities in Northeast Asia, the adoption and 
      full realisation of these objectives would be an extraordinary 
      achievement. As an interim step, participating states agreed that UNEP 
      would coordinate implementation of the final Action Plan until a regional 
      coordinating secretariat is established within the region. Meanwhile, 
      national capabilities running in parallel are the institutional foundation 
      of the Plan. 
      <P>A related regional project overlaps with the short-term objectives of 
      the NOWPAP. The project, titled Prevention and Management of Marine 
      Pollution in East Asia Seas, is a proposed $8 million activity over five 
      years funded by the Global Environment Facility and implemented by the UN 
      Development Program. The scope is broader than that of NOWPAP as the GEF 
      project includes ASEAN states (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, 
      Philippines, Singapore, Thailand), Cambodia, China, North Korea, and 
      Vietnam. 
      <P>The project was formulated in two expert missions that travelled to the 
      region in December 1992 and February/March 1993. The general approach 
      focuses on developing national institutional and legal capacities for 
      integrated coastal zone management and control of marine pollution arising 
      from international conventions, primarily by provision of technical 
      assistance, developing regional collaboration via a network of 
      collaborating institutions, conducting environmental monitoring and 
      evaluation, and increasing public awareness. The project will use national 
      demonstration projects to exemplify methodologies used in relation to each 
      of these components. In the area of integrated coastal zone management, 
      for example, comprehensive planning and management will be undertaken in 
      the harbor and surrounding area at Xiamen in China, and in the Batangas 
      Bay in the Philippines. Thus, the GEF project is intended to move beyond 
      mere monitoring of and reactive response to the problems of marine 
      pollution to innovative, proactive, and practical management measures 
      commensurate with the rapidly growing problem. 
      <P><B>2.2 Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC/WESTPAC) </B>
      <P>The IOC was established in 1960 as a functionally autonomous body 
      within UNESCO and is charged with basic oceanographic research. Under the 
      IOC's rubric, a Cooperative Study of Kuroshio and Adjacent Regions had 
      been conducted between 1965-77. In this case, the study area was the 
      Kuroshio current which spans the East China Sea, the Southern Sea of 
      Japan, the Eastern Philippines Sea, and (later) the South China Sea. 
      <P>The IOC's Sub Commission for Western Pacific (WESTPAC) was established 
      in 1989. Given that the earlier effort on the Kuroshio had relied on the 
      scientific efforts and contributions of only a few countries (and that 
      Southeast Asian developing countries had minimal participation due to lack 
      of scientific and technical resources), the WESTPAC program was designed 
      from the outset to increase local human and technical capabilities in the 
      course of fundamental research into ocean climatic and food resources 
      variability, and improved understanding of geological processes which 
      affect the economies of the western Pacific states. 
      <P>The Secretariat is to be established in Bangkok which hosted the second 
      session of the Commission in January 1993 (the next session is planned for 
      1996 and will likely take place in Tokyo). Due to the vast WESTPAC area 
      (which encompasses the Pacific west of a line following the Emperor Trench 
      from Kamchatka Peninsula, to Wake Island, along the Tuamotu Archipelago, 
      and back to Antarctica south of New Zealand), WESTPAC adopted a 
      sub-regional approach to implementing its research program (see Table 2.1 
      for membership). IOC itself notes that the current program involves much 
      greater cooperation among states of the Northeast Asian region.

        <P></P></UL>The goals of an IOC regional sub commission are to:

      </LI></UL></OL>
      <P>WESTPAC identified nine projects to achieve these general objectives at 
      its first meeting in Hangzhou, China, in February 1990, and adopted a 
      Medium Term Plan (1991-1995). These nine projects are: 
      <P>
      <UL>Ocean Science in Relation to Living Resources:<BR>Toxic and anoxic 
        phenomena associated with algal blooms (red tides)<BR>Recruitment of 
        Penaeid Prawns in Indo-Western Pacific
        <P>Marine Pollution Research and Monitoring:<BR>Monitoring heavy metals 
        and organochlorine pesticides using Musselwatch<BR>Assessment of river 
        inputs to seas in WESTPAC Region
        <P>Ocean Dynamics and Climate<BR>Banding of porite corals as component 
        of ocean climate studies<BR>Ocean dynamics in the northwest 
        Pacific<BR>Continental shelf circulation in the western Pacific
        <P>Ocean science in relation to non-living resources<BR>WESTPAC 
        palaeogeographic map<BR>Margins of active plates.<BR></P></UL>
      <P>Obviously, there may be some overlap in activities envisaged to occur 
      under the rubrics of WESTPAC and NOWPAP. Moreover, many of the WESTPAC 
      activities are conducted in the South Pacific and in East and Southeast 
      Asian oceans (thus overlapping UNEP's East Asian and Southwest Pacific 
      Regional Action Plans rather than NOWPAP). The IOC Secretariat believe, 
      however, that WESTPAC will have to draw on the stronger national marine 
      scientific and technological capabilities in Northeast Asian states if it 
      is to succeed. 
      <P>Moreover, WESTPAC's SEAWATCH program may be helpful in the 
      implementation of NOWPAP. Also, work by Northeast Asian members of WESTPAC 
      (which includes all six states that participate in NOWPAP) on continental 
      shelf circulation, ocean dynamics, paleogeographic mapping, tectonics and 
      coastal zones, and on musselwatch and harmful algal blooms, are all either 
      more active in Northeast Asia than in East or Southeast Asia, or are 
      implemented on a western Pacific-wide basis without sub regional focus. 
      The IOC Secretariat suggest that a mechanism may need to be set up to 
      coordinate with NOWPAP, as has occurred already via the Coordinating Body 
      on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) farther south. WESTPAC anticipates, for 
      example, conducting training in the field of modelling of coastal 
      circulation in order to predict and control accidental oil spills. It is 
      also developing a WESTPAC Action Plan as follow-up to UNCED, both of which 
      appear to be similar to concerns raised at NOWPAP. 
      <P><B>2.3 Northeast Asian Environment Programme (ESCAP/UNDP)</B> 
      <P>The Northeast Asian Environment Programme initiative arose out of a 
      symposium held in Seoul in September 1992 which had supported the 
      development of an informal environmental network; and preceded by an 
      earlier joint memorandum of understanding between Russia and South Korea 
      calling for the creation of a regional environmental forum. 
      <P>The first Northeast Asian Conference on Environment was held in 
      Niigata, Japan the following October, and was organised jointly by the 
      Japanese Environment Agency and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Delegations 
      from China, Russia, and South Korea attended (not North Korea due to 
      sensitivities on the part of Japanese foreign affairs officials although 
      participants suggested that it should be invited to the next meeting which 
      was held in Seoul in mid-September, 1993). 
      <P>The first Conference sought to promote a frank policy dialogue on 
      environmental problems "of common concern to the region as a whole." To 
      this end, the participants agreed to convene the Conference regularly (in 
      principle, annually), to be hosted by different countries of the region. 
      In addition to emphasising the role of local government in regional 
      cooperation, the participants suggested the following possible priority 
      areas for regional cooperation
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Information sharing and exchange network 
        <LI>Joint surveys and monitoring on acid rain, marine pollution, 
        biodiversity 
        <LI>Collaborative research and training 
        <LI>Case studies of economic instruments for environmental management. 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>This mandate led to the convening of the Meeting of Senior Officials on 
      Environment Cooperation in Northeast Asia, organised by the regional UN 
      commission ESCAP in cooperation with UNEP and UNDP. The meeting took place 
      in Seoul in February 1993 and was attended by the same five states (not 
      North Korea). The participants considered a consultant's report which gave 
      an indicative list of possible areas of collaboration, and emphasized 
      energy-related air pollution, and capacity building as important cross 
      sectoral themes. They also suggested that only one or two substantive 
      issues be concentrated upon at the outset in order to demonstrate the 
      utility of cooperation, and that these activities be expanded 
      incrementally. Although they cautioned against an overly ambitious 
      program, they also recognised that identifying priority areas also 
      necessitated the adoption of an overall strategy for regional 
      environmental cooperation and a support arrangement. 
      <P>The following areas for regional cooperation were canvassed: 
      <P>
      <DL>
        <DD>Technology for sustainable development and UNEP's Regional Centre on 
        Technology Transfer at Osaka and Shiga (Japan)<BR>Energy issues, 
        especially clean coal combustion (China, Mongolia, South 
        Korea)<BR>Monitoring and surveying of air pollution, especially acid 
        rain (Japan, Russia, South Korea, Mongolia)<BR>Forest decline (South 
        Korea)<BR>Capacity building (South Korea)<BR>Information exchange and 
        network (South Korea)<BR></DD></DL>
      <P>The following priority areas within which specific projects for 
      regional cooperation could be developed were adopted: 
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Energy and air pollution 
        <LI>Capacity building 
        <LI>Ecosystem management, in particular deforestation and 
        desertification. 
        <LI>Intercalibration of pollution measurement equipment. </LI></UL>
      <P>The meeting concluded that coastal and marine pollution issues should 
      be addressed within the UNEP NOWPAP framework. 
      <P>In mid-September 1993, the Ministry of Environment in South Korea 
      convened the Second Northeast Asian Conference on Environmental 
      Cooperation at the ministerial and/or deputy ministerial level accompanied 
      by high level technical experts to discuss common problems, experiences 
      with various economic instruments, harmonising monitoring of pollution, 
      etc. The major topics considered at the Seoul meeting were: 
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Exploration of methods to enhance environmental cooperation in 
        Northeast Asia including harmonisation of the on-going environmental 
        meetings 
        <LI>Market-based policy measures for environmental management 
        <LI>Pollution measuring methods, including criteria, units and 
        intercalibration 
        <LI>Exploration of joint research topics 
        <LI>Classification of hazardous wastes 
        <LI>Experiences and roles of local government in Northeast Asian 
        environmental cooperation. 
        <LI></LI></UL>
      <P>The follow-up meeting to the February 1993 Meeting of Senior Officials 
      is to be held in Beijing in early 1994. As chair of the Meetings and the 
      lead UN agency for the ongoing program, ESCAP lends a more representative 
      flavor to the deliberations which suits foreign affairs ministries, and is 
      less apt to take a proactive role to defining a technical basis for 
      political consultations than would be UNEP or UNDP and some national 
      environmental agencies. A consultant is to prepare a review of candidate 
      proposals for joint projects under the priority areas listed above for 
      presentation to the next intergovernmental meeting in Beijing. 
      <P><B>2.4 Sub-Regional Technical Cooperation and Development Programme 
      (UNDP) </B>
      <P>In addition to UNEP and UNESCO, the United Nations agency for technical 
      cooperation, the UN Development Programme, has mediated and facilitated 
      cooperation at a regional level. UNDP is instrumental in the Tumen River 
      Area Development Programme which has a joint environmental component. It 
      has also obtained agreement on two regional projects under the Global 
      Environment Facility with developing countries of the region-- one on 
      greenhouse gases, and a second on marine pollution. In addition, UNDP has 
      developed a sub-regional programme of cooperation between six regional 
      states on themes pertaining to sustainable development, albeit at a 
      relatively low level of activity. These include: 
      <P>
      <OL>Thermal combustion and pollution reduction programme. This programme 
        recommended cross-border and inter-country modelling of air pollution, 
        provision of clean coal technology, cogeneration, emission control 
        technologies, etc.<BR>Expansion of Temperate Zone Food 
        Crops.<BR>Renewable Energy Applications for Rural Energy Supply. Country 
        exchanges have occurred, for example, between China and North Korea.
        <P></P></OL>The Tumen River Development Programme is the most advanced of 
      these sub- regional activities. It is envisaged to be a multi-billion 
      dollar project involving six regional states in which North Korea, Russia 
      and China will jointly develop a free economic zone. The states have 
      created a Joint Management Committee to oversee planning activities. The 
      Joint Management Committee will supervise subcommissions on trade and 
      logistics; telecommunications, banking, and industry and infrastructure 
      investment strategy. 
      <P>As we noted earlier, the Tumen River Area Development Project may 
      establish important legal and political precedents that will bear on other 
      regional environmental agreements. To the extent that the Commission 
      established to run the project keeps open the possibility that it will 
      enhance economic cooperation in Northeast Asia as a whole--and keeps open 
      the possibility of admitting non-riparian states such as Japan to 
      membership--the Tumen River project may become the nucleus for Northeast 
      Asia's first economic and environmental institution
      <P><A name=III><FONT face="Arial, helvetica" size=2><B>III. Critical 
      Issues</B></FONT></A> 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, helvetica" size=2>
      <P>In conclusion, we point to five critical issues that arise from the 
      preceding discussion. These are: 1) capacity building; 2) spillover 
      effects between environmental issues (especially from climate change); 3) 
      monitoring and enforcement issues; 4) financing; and 5), the importance of 
      non governmental organisations and public awareness. We conclude with a 
      series of questions for further research and analysis. 
      <P><B>3.1 Capacity Building: </B>The initial emphasis in the various 
      regional initiatives that are underway is to build on capacity at a 
      national level. Given the uneven, and in some cases, undeveloped technical 
      and organisational capabilities found in the region, this emphasis is 
      entirely appropriate. 
      <P>Capacity building, however, is not simply training at the national 
      level and the creation of an environmental oversight capability. It also 
      refers to the ability to bring together the different stakeholders (non 
      governmental, official, business, and academics) in a policy dialogue; to 
      inform all relevant actors; to make effective use of that information; to 
      introduce and use economic and regulatory instruments for environmental 
      management; and to have the institutional capacity to coordinate the many 
      components and activities at all different levels and across all sectors 
      of the society and economy. In short, capacity building is a corollary of 
      a broad based program of social and institutional development, especially 
      in economies-in-transition or in developing countries. 
      <P>In addition to these challenges at the national level which are 
      prerequisites of effective national participation in a regional programme, 
      regional programs for environmental cooperation also entail developing 
      regional capacities in the medium and long-term. 
      <P><B>3.2 Regional Dimensions of Global Issues:</B> Many global concerns 
      such as ozone and climate change may be dealt with best in global fora. 
      Some global issues, however, may interrelate with regional issues in ways 
      that cannot be ignored. Climate change, for example, may redistribute 
      regional atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns and thereby 
      affect concerns such as transfrontier pollution, ecosystem management, and 
      desertification, at a regional level. 
      <P>In particular, the impact of climate change may be a productive area 
      for regional collaboration. This issue is also one that concerns all 
      states in the region, yet (in contrast to acid rain) does not arise from 
      or within any specific state or group of states within the region. 
      <P>At this time, global circulation models offer poor resolution for the 
      northeast region, let alone for a nation. Participants in the study 
      therefore can only pose qualitative scenarios of climate change at this 
      stage, with consequent uncertainty with regard to the range of possible 
      costs and benefits of climate change. 
      <P>A regional scientific approach to developing a regional climate model 
      is therefore an urgent priority. Such a project should draw on existing 
      Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and attempts to nest a regional model 
      within the global models, rather than attempting the extremely costly 
      exercise of building a GCM for use within the region or starting a 
      regional exercise from scratch. The choice of regional climate modelling 
      parameters, the data requirements to validate the model, the 
      interpretation of the model's results etc are all items that require a 
      regional rather than a national approach., 
      <P>The proposed Global Change Regional Research Network for Temperate East 
      Asia under the START program and known as TEACOM will address this 
      imperative. This project proposes to: 
      <P>
      <UL type=CIRCLE>
        <LI>Define regional research priorities and identify regional questions 
        with global significance 
        <LI>Support education and training activities 
        <LI>Establish a regional data management and information system 
        <LI>Distribute research results to scientists within the region and 
        communicate results to decision makers of the region to serve as the 
        scientific basis for developing strategies for mitigating and adapting 
        to global environmental changes. </LI></UL>
      <P>Although the Regional Research Network will address global change 
      issues, it will also include the regional response to global climate 
      change, land use patterns, and land- ocean interactions in the coastal 
      zone. 
      <P>In addition to scientists from the standard six countries of Northeast 
      Asia, the program proposal suggests that the academy based in Taipei 
      (China) might also be invited to participate. It might be, therefore, a 
      suitable scientific rubric under which to house a regional effort to 
      define climate change impacts and regional responses to these impacts. 
      <P><B>3.3 Monitoring, Verification, and Non-Coercive Enforcement:</B> All 
      institutions based on international cooperation face free riding by 
      signatories who obtain the benefits of an international agreement while 
      avoiding the costs by non-compliance. The likelihood that signatories to 
      regional environmental agreements might try to avoid meeting their 
      commitments poses the question of monitoring, verification and enforcement 
      of compliance. 
      <P>Fortunately, there are important precedents for monitoring and 
      verifying international atmospheric agreements, at the regional level in 
      Europe, and globally in ozone depletion convention. This experience 
      provides some signposts for how binding regional environmental agreements 
      in Northeast Asia might be monitored, verified, and enforced. 
      <P>Verification is the international control of compliance with agreed 
      measures and behaviour by means of tools and procedures agreed upon in an 
      instrument of international law--for example, a protocol on compliance to 
      a long range air pollution control convention. Verification can be defined 
      as having different densities depending upon the level of distrust between 
      parties to the agreement and the technical difficulty of obtaining 
      information with an adequate level of confidence on the other. 
      <P>A regional verification procedure would be multilateral rather than 
      bilateral in implementation (although it may rely heavily on 
      national/unilateral monitoring and verification capabilities such as 
      satellite systems). Assuming that all parties will be accorded equal 
      treatment in the protocol, it is reasonable to suppose that all parties 
      also will be subject to monitoring and verification by an implementing 
      organisation established under regional conventions. 
      <P>Anthropogenic sources of many pollutants vary greatly with respect to 
      characteristics that affect greatly their suitability for monitoring and 
      verification. Some are stationary, emit copiously and continuously, and 
      are suitable for direct, quantified monitoring. Power stations and large 
      factories exemplify this type of emitter. Other sources are stationary and 
      numerous but only emit intermittently very small quantities of gas. There 
      are also very many mobile point sources that are sporadic emitters such as 
      vehicles and livestock. Finally, there are very diffuse sources such as 
      farmers whose fertiliser may end up in rivers that pollute semi-enclosed 
      oceans. Thus, the monitoring problem is complex. 
      <P>As only the first "large" category is suitable to direct monitoring and 
      verification, most verification will be done indirectly by using national 
      and UN statistics for many production and consumption balances for items 
      that would be of concern in regional environmental conventions. Parties to 
      a regional Convention must agree on the types of data, required 
      disaggregation and detail, and common reporting rules for national 
      reports. This data can be analysed and verified by the implementing 
      organisation which is thereby relieved of the onerous task of collecting 
      information from scratch. 
      <P>The history of the verification of international agreements offers some 
      important lessons for environmental verification systems. First, 
      environmental costs and benefits may not accrue as fast as in the areas of 
      arms control and the stakes are not perceived as central to the immediate 
      security of the state nor (usually) to regime survival in that state. 
      <P>States may therefore be less demanding of a verification system for 
      environmental agreements than in other domains. Moreover, when states 
      coordinate because of self interest, there is little reason to defect or 
      cheat and little or no verification or enforcement is needed. If the costs 
      of many environmental measures are low, then verification measures are 
      needed mostly to build confidence in the regime rather than to raise the 
      question of non compliance and enforcement. 
      <P>Second, it is inevitable and proper that enforcement responsibility 
      will be lodged primarily at the same level as implementation 
      responsibility, that is, within nation states. The bulk of the monitoring 
      and verification for regional environmental agreements should be conducted 
      at this level, rather than at the regional level. Environmental agreements 
      should strive also for maximal transparency and openness, including a 
      strong role for non- governmental organisations in monitoring compliance. 
      <P>In addition to the standard repertoire of political pressure, sanctions 
      etc. against non- complying states, alternatives to coercive enforcement 
      have emerged. In some instances, states have recognised each other's 
      licensing rather than ceding licensing powers to an international 
      authority. Such reciprocal recognition schemes operate in many areas 
      including phytosanitary certificates for exports, shipping oil pollution 
      prevention certificates, marine waste disposal permits, hazardous 
      materials trade, and trade in endangered species. States also harmonise 
      standards and standard setting laws and procedures, often by adopting 
      models from overseas. (For example, the environmental impact assessment, 
      green labelling and pollution taxes). 
      <P>Many states have also committed themselves outside of treaties to 
      providing early warning and notification, for example, with respect to 
      banned chemicals exchange of standards, or adjustments to trade-controlled 
      items (such as endangered species). Regimes also create transnational 
      networks of lower level "operational" national officials who short circuit 
      hierarchical communications across boundaries, or who communicate directly 
      with international organisations that may then reintroduce environmental 
      information at much higher political levels in the same nation state. Such 
      structures can defuse and even prevent disputes arising in the first 
      place. 
      <P>Non adversarial techniques have also developed to resolve international 
      disputes from escalating to interstate conflicts. Local legal challenges 
      have been mounted across borders thereby achieving settlement without 
      involving the states themselves. (In Europe and North America, this 
      technique requires that legal systems grant status to foreign parties in 
      local judicial or administrative procedures). The filing of complaints and 
      the launching of infringement hearings are two other techniques that have 
      been used (in the former, in the Montreal Protocol; in the latter, in the 
      European Economic Community). 
      <P>Reporting requirements are also an important means of imposing national 
      "discipline" on treaty parties, especially when combined with 
      international expert auditing and public debate in committees or annual 
      conferences. Such procedures are already well developed in the 
      occupational health and safety agreements administered by the 
      International Labour Organisation. Similar procedures are used by the 
      International Monetary Fund and multilateral funding agencies also conduct 
      national and sectoral audits as preconditions for or requirements of 
      development loan agreements. Environmental auditing, however, has a weak 
      tradition although the Montreal Protocol requires substantial reporting to 
      permit monitoring of compliance and administration of various aspects of 
      the agreement. 
      <P><B>3.4 Financing: </B>The issue of who will pay for the costs of 
      regional environmental cooperation is central. Donor states must recognise 
      that obtaining the benefits of cooperation require to achieve regional 
      sustainable development, including the environmental benefits, 
      necessitates investment in creating a regional institutional framework. 
      The donor community has a critical role to play in providing additional 
      resources, especially in capacity building for regional environmental 
      management. In the long term, national and regional institutions should 
      become self financing. 
      <P>Donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, should ensure that 
      environmental conditionalities are an integral part of project and 
      structural adjustment lending for all recipient countries in the region. 
      In short, both bilateral and multilateral financing should be restructured 
      to directly address the environmental dimensions of sustainable 
      development. 
      <P>Third, donor agencies should be reformulating their own programs to 
      develop a research and analytical capacity to identify regional as well as 
      national benefits of sustainable development and to incorporate these in 
      lending activities. In particular, they should invest resources in 
      identifying complementarities and synergies of environmental and economic 
      measures in Northeast Asia. 
      <P><B>3.5 Non Governmental Organisations and Public Awareness:</B> In 
      conclusion, we stress that without active participation by civil society, 
      many environmental policies are doomed to failure. Regional efforts are no 
      less subject to this imperative than local, national or global activities. 

      <P>Non governmental organisations have already played an important role in 
      paving the way to regional environmental cooperation. The various meetings 
      convened by scholars at the East West Center on regional oceans 
      management, the PECC Fisheries Taskforce, or the regional Northeast 
      Asia/Northwest Pacific environmental fora convened by the Asia Foundation 
      in 1992 and 1993, and the East Asian Parliamentarians for Environment are 
      leading examples. In addition to providing a backchannel for the exchange 
      of ideas and proposals for regional management of environmental problems, 
      non governmental organisations can mobilise popular support for these 
      initiatives at a grass roots level. As Agenda 21 states: 
      <P>
      <DL>
        <DD>One of the major challenges facing the world community as it seeks 
        to replace unsustainable development patterns with environmentally sound 
        and sustainable development is the need to activate a sense of common 
        purpose on behalf of all sectors of society. The chances of forging such 
        a sense of purpose will depend on the willingness of all sectors to 
        participate in genuine social partnership and dialogue, while 
        recognising the independent roles, responsibilities and special 
        capacities of each. </DD></DL>
      <P>It is crucial, therefore, to involve non governmental organisations in 
      regional deliberations and activities in Northeast Asia at the outset 
      rather than as an afterthought. 
      <P><B>3.6 Further Research and Analysis: </B>A variety of theoretical 
      frameworks can be applied to the processes of integration, and to 
      categorise different types of regional activities. These theoretical 
      approaches encompass very different modalities of interstate behaviour and 
      structural circumstances. Two two basic models exist for regional 
      cooperation on environmental issues, namely, collaboration whereby a 
      common resource is managed by two or more states, versus cooperation 
      between states over a range of environmental issues. In this essay, we 
      discovered that states in Northeast Asia are engaged in extensive albeit 
      incipient environmental cooperation in spite of the existence of enormous 
      asymmetries of military and economic power within the region; and that 
      such cooperation is found with respect to a common resource (marine 
      issues), a shared environmental threat (transboundary air pollution) and a 
      range of bilaterally contentious environmental issues (such as the role of 
      environmental concerns in regional trade and investment flows). States in 
      Northeast Asia seem to have little concern about theoretical consistency 
      or institutional neatness in approaching environmental issues, but have 
      been driven to adopt pragmatic approaches consistent with overarching 
      political and security constraints. 
      <P>Given this evidence, the following questions arise for further 
      comparative research on regional environmental cooperation: Are regional 
      environmental problems and demands on nation-states a new form of 
      functional imperative leading in turn to new regional institutions and 
      political communities? 
      <P>Do regional environmental institutions provide the political "space" 
      for new types of political mobilisation with implications for personal and 
      group identities that transcend national loyalties? 
      <P>Do states cooperate with each other at a regional level primarily on 
      environmental issues of local rather than national or global nature? Or 
      are they driven to cooperate more by transboundary pollution, crossborder 
      environmental issues, or regional demands posed by global environmental 
      deterioration? 
      <P>Is the sequence of adoption by which local-national versus regional and 
      transboundary issues an important determinant of the success of a regime? 
      <P>How do environmental issues interrelate with political-military and 
      economic integration at a regional level? 
      <P>Is environmental cooperation driven in part by geopolitical and 
      geoeconomic objectives of nation states in search of political or economic 
      advantage? 
      <P>And do environmental issues motivate closer military or economic ties 
      between states facing "environmental aggression" or "environmental 
      discrimination" by external adversaries or competitors? 
      <P>To what extent are successful regional environmental regimes grounded 
      in the search for economies of scale and learning opportunities for 
      building national environmental management capacities, versus ameliorating 
      or avoiding environmental insults which cross borders? 
      <P>Does the existence of a regional "giant" or dominant state facilitate 
      regional environmental regimes? Or do overly-symmetrical power relations 
      within a region block such regimes? 
      <P>Do differing political cultures which prevail in different regions 
      affect the pace, scope, and content of regional environmental regimes? In 
      particular, do sub-regional cooperation programs in Asia follow an "Asian" 
      set of diplomatic and operational codes that contrast with Ango-European 
      approaches to conflict avoidance and resolution? 
      <P>Do regional environmental regimes follow "functional form?" Or is the 
      scope and organisation of the regime unrelated to the eco-geographical 
      "shape" of the environmental problem? 
      <P>Is the performance of environmental regimes best measured by political 
      and institutional indices? 
      <P>Or do objective ecological criteria exist against which to test the 
      success of regimes, especially on a comparative basis? 
      <P>Are international organisations integral to the successful initiation 
      and implementation of regional environmental regimes? 
      <P>Or have bureaucratic interplays between such agencies hindered more 
      than helped states develop regional regimes? 
      <P>What is the relationship between sub-regional environmental regimes of 
      the type considered in this essay with "macro-regional" environmental 
      cooperation such as is found under the North American Free Trade 
      Agreement, or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation consultative process?
