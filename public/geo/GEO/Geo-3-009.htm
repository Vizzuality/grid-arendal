<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A system to make drinking water Arsenic free. This 
system was shown at the International Workshop on Arsenic at BUET on 
Saturday:New Nation photo.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Eight crore people living in as many as 59, out of 
the country's 64 districts have been facing serious health risks due to drinking 
of arsenic-contaminated water.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This was disclosed by the experts at an international 
workshop on "Technologies for Arsenic Removal from Drinking Water" held at 
Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in the city on 
Saturday.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Intake of arsenic associated with food is a common 
phenomenon, but this arsenic is the low-toxicity organic arsenic. But drinking 
water derived from underground source contains arsenic in inorganic form, which 
is of higher toxicity and a significant hazard for human health. Prolonged use 
of arsenic contaminated water for drinking purpose is unsafe and causes serious 
diseases like skin cancer and a number of internal cancers, among others. 
Cardiovascular and neurological diseases have also been found to be linked to 
arsenic contamination," the experts at the workshop said.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The experts also suggested four different approaches 
to remove or reduce arsenic from tubewell water, saying that the removal of 
arsenic from drinking water was possible by passing the water at controlled flow 
rate through wood-charcoal, treating the water with calcium oxide, by 
sedimentation method and by repeated removal of the top surface layer containing 
high level of arsenic.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>"These four methods may be adopted as cheap and 
simple technologies for removal of arsenic from drinking water," they 
said.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>These four different approaches were tested for 
removal or reduction of arsenic level from tubewell water at Goneshampur village 
in Mymensingh sadar upazila between November 2000 and March 2001. Arsenic 
concentrations were determined by an arsenic kit provided by NIPSOM.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Organised by the BUET in collaboration with the 
United Nations University of Tokyo, the three-day workshop was inaugurated by 
Deputy Minister for Local Government, LGRD and Cooperatives Saber Hossain 
Chowdhury while BUET Vice-Chancellor Professor Nooruddin Ahmed chaired the 
function.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Professor Dr M Feroze Ahmed of the Department of 
Civil Engineering, BUET, Dr Zafar Adeel of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development Programme of the UNU, Japan and Professor Dr M Mujibur Rahman of 
BUET also spoke on the occasion.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Researchers, academicians and entrepreneurs working 
on arsenic removal technologies, representatives from different international 
organisations and professionals with practical work experiences in arsenic 
contaminated areas in Bangladesh are participating in this specialised workshop 
to discuss the physical, physico-chemical and biological processes in removal of 
arsenic from the arsenic contaminated waters.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Some 21 papers will be presented in four technical 
sessions of the workshop, with nearly 125 local and foreign experts from the 
USA, the UK, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Nepal and India taking 
part in the workshop.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The experts noted that the number of people drinking 
arsenic contaminated water has increased over last 25 years due to well drilling 
and population growth in Bangladesh. And the number of affected persons may, 
therefore, increase further.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Many programmes on arsenic detection and creation of 
awareness have so far been completed and some are being implemented. "But very 
few efforts have been undertaken for the removal of arsenic from tubewell water 
except to abandon the arsenic affected tubewells", they said.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Speaking on the occasion, Saber Hossain Chowdhury 
described arsenic contamination of water as a major problem facing by the 
country.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Minister called for a collective effort of the 
private sector, NGOs side by side the government to face the arsenic 
contamination of ground water.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>He also suggested for raising awareness among the 
rural households about the arsenic problem.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Saber also urged the scientists and researchers to 
find out proper technological options for mitigating arsenic contamination in 
the country.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nooruddin Ahmed warned 
that arsenic in drinking water was not desirable at any concentration.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dr Zafar Adeel said the arsenic contamination in 
Bangladesh had reached at a quite unprecedented scale.</FONT></P>

in ground water in 47 dists crosses WHO limit, says study</A></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A group of scientists in Jadavpur 
University in Kolkata have observed that arsenic level in groundwater in 47 
districts in Bangladesh and nine district s in Indian West Bengal states have 
already crossed the World Health Organisation (WHO) maximum permissible limit of 
50 micro-gram per litre, reports BSS.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>The group, led by head of the School of 
Environmental Studies (SOES) of Jadavpur University, Dipankar Chakraborti, said 
the world's four biggest sites of groundwater contamination are Bangladesh, West 
Bengal of India, Inner Mongolia of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. 
They said huge withdrawal of groundwater is taking place because of agricultural 
irrigation.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>"We have made a green revolution at the 
cost of underground water," a study of the SOES observed.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>Exploring the state of the diffusion of 
available techniques for removal of arsenic from groundwater, the SOES 
scientists noted that in the villages of India and Bangladesh even a highly 
successful technology may not succeed unless it fits in the rural context and is 
accepted by the rural people.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Development of such technology is only 
possible when a combination is made between technocrats and villagers with 
proper village level participation," the scientists said.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>They said appropriate arsenic removal 
technologies should be economically viable and socially acceptable.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>The researchers said the processes used 
in the arsenic-affected areas of Chile and Taiwan at full scale treatment plant 
is coagulation. But the University of Connecticut (patent pending) has claimed a 
novel and cost effective Arsenic Remedy Technology (AsRT) for the immobilisation 
of inorganic arsenic such as arsenates and arsenites.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quoting field survey reports, they 
said, in some arsenic-affected villages many families due to high iron content 
in their tubewell water cannot drink the water directly. To make it drinkable, 
they just keep the water after withdrawal from tubewell for some time, when a 
brown precipitate settles at the bottom and the users decant the upper clear 
water or use a common filter to arrest the flock.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>"It is a burning question how and where 
to dispose of arsenic rich flock. Many thinks that arsenic rich flock if 
disposed of on soil, may contaminate the aquifer," the scientists said adding 
that in the laboratory (of SOES) we found that cow-dung can eliminate arsenic in 
volatile form.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>Referring to some tests, the SOES 
scientists said arsenic removal system of Jadavpur University was proved to be 
93 per cent to 98.5 per cent effective according to official test results of 
Government Industrial Toxicological Research, Lucknow, India, National Test 
House, India, CSIR institute at Nagpur India as well as independent research 
conducted by Asia Arsenic Network (AAN), Japan and Thailand bureau of the Asia 
Arsenic Network.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>The AAN (Japan) has purchased 300 units 
of arsenic removal system from CSIR (Council of Scientific and industrial 
Research) New Delhi, India and installed them in the arsenic-affected areas 
across Bangladesh, experts in the SOES said.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>The SOES researchers opined that the 
actual solution of groundwater arsenic contamination in Bangladesh and India 
would be achieved through proper watershed management utilising the available 
surface water.</FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT face="Arial Unicode MS" size=3><B><A name=3>Arsenic the 
silent killer</A></B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>by Nasrine R. Karim</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 20th century saw many catastrophes among which 
Chernobyl and the chemical disaster in Bhobal are worth mentioning. But Arsenic 
poisoning in Bangladesh is overshadowing them all as over 75 million people are 
at potential risk and thousands have reached the point of no return.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ironically, the drinking water crisis in Bangladesh 
is the result of safe water drinking programme spearheaded by UNICEF. The 
villagers were weaned away from the use of surface water for drinking and 
cooking as surface water because surface water was declared the source of deadly 
microbes and bacteria that can cause to life threatening pathogenic diseases. 
UNICEF assisted the Government to sink pipes into underground aquifers for clean 
groundwater. Presently, out of 5 million such tube-wells, 3 million may be 
contaminated with arsenic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The region’s high level of naturally occurring 
arsenic went undiscovered until the 1990s. So far, action to address the problem 
has been very slow and arduous. World Bank and the Government have jointly set 
up a specialized unit at a cost of about $50 million under the Local Government 
and Rural Development Ministry - Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation and Water 
Sanitation Project (BAMWSP). There is also, apparently, a government task force 
to oversee the developments in the sector.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>With the donors insisting that assessment of 
technologies be made by a third party for transparency, WaterAid/DFID funded the 
rapid assessment of household Level arsenic removal technologies. Out of 
original twenty-one technologies, seven were found acceptable to be used for the 
masses with some reservations. Finally, only four were given certification by 
TAG/BAMWSP. TAG is the Technical Advisory Group who is in charge of vetting all 
technologies to be used by the public in Bangladesh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Arsenic is a metal. Unlike iron, arsenic has no 
colour, taste or smell. This is a silent killer. One cannot get rid of it by 
boiling as we do in case of microbe-contaminated water. Only chemicals can 
effectively remove arsenic as other metals like iron or mercury. Arsenic also 
moves within the soil. So if one finds one tube-well free from arsenic today, it 
may not be so tomorrow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Arsenic is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
into the blood stream. It is still not understood what is the mechanism through 
which arsenic causes cancer. However, the NRC noted that data suggest that 
arsenic may cause chromosomal abnormalities that lead to cancer. Sensitivity to 
arsenic effects, including carcinogenic effects, seems to vary with individuals 
and appear to be influenced by factors such as nutrition and genetic 
susceptibility. However, in Bangladesh the problem is magnified dramatically due 
to thousands suffering from skin lesions, tumours, lung deficiencies and still 
more endured amputations from gangrene and other drastic procedures to ward off 
death.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Today over 20 to 30 million people are affected, 
tomorrow a further 75 million may be affected. What steps are being taken to 
combat this enormous catastrophe of the 21st century? BAMWSP, under the guidance 
of the ministry must develop a schedule, or a protocol or a sustainable strategy 
to bring effective relief to the helpless people of Bangladesh without any 
further delay. Funds are available with donors.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>BAMWSP has access to millions of dollars, yet why has 
not the mitigation works started?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is the democratic right of the people of 
Bangladesh to have access to safe drinking water. The authorities must take this 
up as a national priority. Poverty, fiscal and economic alleviation, education 
and future building are of no value, without clean water.</FONT></P>
