<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>VICTIMS AND DAMAGES</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Nearly 40 weak-to-moderate earthquakes rattled El Salvador 
for more than five hours on Tuesday, 8 May,causing no injuries and little damage 
but sending millions of panic-stricken people scrambling for safety.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>The earthquakes, between 2.5 and 4.8 degrees of magnitude on 
the open-ended Richter scale, were shallow in depth and had their epicenter near 
San Vicente, 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of San Salvador, the Geo-Technical 
Research Center said.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Several buildings in San Vicente that were damaged during 
the stronger earthquakes earlier this year but remained in service, sustained 
heavier damage this time, leaving hundreds of people homeless.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Two sections of the Pan-American Highway, which links North, 
Central and South America, caved in near San Vicente, while thousands of 
residents in Santiago de Maria, 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of San Salvador, 
were left without electricity. In San Salvador, public buildings and schools 
were evacuated at the onset of the earthquakes.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Meanwhile, on Wednesday, 9<SUP> </SUP>May, more that 30 
aftershocks from Tuesday&#8217;s tremors were felt in the area of San Vicente. The 
inhabitants slept out on the streets for fear of new earthquakes and listened to 
the moment-by-moment reports of the tremors. Classes have temporarily been 
suspended.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the San Jacinto area, the buildings that were the least 
damaged all toppled to the ground with last Tuesday&#8217;s sequence of tremors. Most 
homes are empty because the inhabitants have not wanted to sleep amidst the 
debris and therefore went to stay at homes of relatives or friends to be 
safer.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On 9 May, the President of the Republic, Francisco Flores, 
carried out a visit to the areas that were the epicenters of the earthquakes. 
The Head of State committed to support the department of San Vicente in 
reconstructing homes and setting up temporary housing.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Meanwhile, due to the earthquakes recorded on 8 May, the 
number of affected persons increased to 1,067 in the city of Mercedes Umaña, 
department of Usulutan. Forty-four homes were destroyed, and 82 were reported to 
be seriously damages.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of May, the Minister of Public Works 
announced that the earthquakes that have been felt are direct replicas of 
January and February&#8217;s earthquakes and were a result of the settling of the 
activated faults.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the department of Cuscatlan, the Jiboa River has 
increased its flow by more than two meters in the last 33 days. After the strong 
quakes on Tuesday, the river rose 11 centimeters, which means the neighbouring 
villages will become isolated. Therefore, the construction of a canal to 
evacuate these waters is in progress.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>A survey presented on 9 May by the Central American 
University about the performance of different institutions facing El Salvador&#8217;s 
disaster showed that the international cooperation agencies scored an 8.54 on a 
scale from 0 to 10, coming in second, after the media. Other top scorers were 
the assistance organizations, followed by the Armed Forces, the Catholic Church, 
private enterprise, NGOs and President Francisco Flores with a 7.09 
score.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO EL 
SALVADOR</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>International assistance to El Salvador continues to be 
slow, with most funds coming from the International Finance Institutions. The 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recently provided US$20,000,000 in soft 
loans for the water sector. For the UN system, the responses are still very 
limited, with UNICEF being one of the agencies that has received more funds in 
comparative terms. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), UN Population Fund (UNFPA), etc, have received less than 40% 
of their total ceiling as per the international appeal, based on reports given 
by UN Coordination. The World Food Programme (WFP) has received considerably 
more, and they are also asking for more food support to complete their global 
request.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>INTER-AGENCY 
CO-ORDINATION</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>UN coordination is working well with exchanges of 
information and cross-cutting issues being resolved at the discussion table. In 
health, our coordination with Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO is 
excellent, particularly in the area of Dengue Fever prevention. Meetings are 
held every two weeks at present.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>UNICEF also continues to provide information to the main 
donors and allies. During the last two weeks, the Representative visited and 
exchanged information with the US Embassy and USAID Representative, the Italian 
Embassy and their technical group helping the Red Cross and the German Embassy 
and the GTZ group.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>UNICEF INTERVENTIONS</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>Water and Sanitation</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>After the earthquake recorded on Tuesday, one water 
treatment system has been badly damaged in Apastepeque. There are 4,000 people 
without water service between San Nicolas and San Felipe.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Recently, the UNICEF <FONT size=+0>Water and Environmental 
Sanitation (</FONT>WES) Emergency Operation has advanced the strategy of 
providing safe water supplies and sanitation in order to prevent epidemics and 
water-borne diseases, while returning children and their families to normalcy by 
replacing their basic services and helping them rebuild dignified homes in safe 
areas. UNICEF counterparts calculate that to date the UNICEF Emergency WES 
Operation has directly benefited more than 260,000 people. The principal 
reconstruction activities recently have been in sanitation, through the 
rebuilding of permanent latrines in towns and rural villages. The principal 
counterpart for this activity has been the Ministry of Health, but UNICEF has 
also played a key role in bringing to bear the installed capacity of 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), who have provided personnel and logistics 
in the field. Plan International, CARE and Medicos del Mundo have been key 
partners, as have the national NGOs FUSAI and ProVida.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>During this reporting period, the Ministry of Health and 
NGOs have installed more than 900 latrines with support from UNICEF, as follows: 
In La Paz department, San Juan Nonualco: 160 latrines; San Pedro Nonualco: 150; 
Santa Maria Ostuma: 100; San Miguel Tepezontes: 60; San Juan Tepezontes: 50; San 
Emigdio: 40; and San Rafael Obrajuelo: 50. In San Vicente department, Tepetitan: 
100. In the major Cafetalón shelter near San Salvador, the last of 200 latrines 
were completed. The construction of latrine components by the Ministry of 
Health, with labour and materials financed by UNICEF, continues. Health 
promoters and NGOs will install these new solutions in the field.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Regarding access to safe water, in this period UNICEF&#8217;s 
principle partner, the national water company ANDA, has installed 14 emergency 
tanks and bladders in 12 towns, and 5 emergency water treatment plants remain in 
operation. ANDA has also involved UNICEF as a key partner in their disaster 
response project, <I>Proyecto Invierno</I>, for which UNICEF is providing 
emergency tanks and bladders to equip 11 warehouses located in areas throughout 
the country that are identified at high risk for flooding, landslides and other 
localised emergencies. Now that the rainy season has arrived, National Aqueduct 
and Sewer Administration</FONT> <FONT face=Arial>(ANDA) is putting great effort 
into completing these warehouses and training staff, municipalities and local 
operators for rapid response. UNICEF has purchased many of these supplies, while 
others were provided through UNICEF by Sweden, Norway and OCHA.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>UNICEF WES is also a key partner to the Tecoluca 
municipality in their new two-year Development Plan. Besides achieving the 
insertion of child rights, children in community radios, and education issues 
into Tecoluca&#8217;s Plan, UNICEF has committed to building water supplies and 
latrines for all the 6,000 earthquake victims of Tecoluca being moved to 8 new 
settlements. These will be built with funds from Sweden, Spain and European 
Community Host Organization (ECHO), which are expected shortly. The local NGO 
ProVida is the executing partner, under guidance of the Ministry of Health and 
ANDA. In other parts of the country, the Ministry of Health and ANDA have 
finalised the identification of almost 100 communities that will rebuild 
aqueducts and receive new wells and latrines with the remaining ECHO funds. 
Agreements for implementation are being negotiated with the Ministry of Health, 
ANDA and the NGOs CARE, Plan, PCI, ProVida and FUSAI.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Finally, UNICEF continues to support the Water and 
Sanitation Network of El Salvador, whose government, NGO and international 
members are gathering information country-wide to create a new National Water 
and Sanitation Information System that will finally identify all communities 
with damaged water and sanitation services, as well as those that have never had 
the service before. To date, 60% of the country is covered by the data 
collection. In some departments, more than 70% of information has been gathered 
(Cabañas, Cuscatlán and Ahuachapán), while one has data for less than 20% of its 
population (La Paz). This effort should be completed within two months, and will 
result in a National Water and Sanitation Reconstruction and Investment Plan, 
led by national government agencies and the El Salvador Network.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>Health</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Within the national reconstruction plan framework, the 
Ministry of Health proposed to UNICEF that cooperation be reinforced in a 
defined geographic area and provide support to the basic system for integral 
care in the department of San Vicente. The selected area comprises the 
Guadalupe, Verapaz, municipalities, which were widely affected by the 
earthquakes.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Although the epidemiological situation of dengue continues 
to be stable, preventive measures have been reinforced by the Ministry of 
Health. Within this framework, UNICEF carried out, on 11 May, the delivery to 
the Ministry of 4 ULV pesticide fumigation pumps, which have the capability to 
eliminate the dengue vector (1,800 homes per day). This collaboration with 
UNICEF significantly reinforces the country&#8217;s ability to face new epidemics. 
Contingency actions are being defined together with the Ministry for new 
cooperation items regarding this issue.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On 10 May, the first case of measles made a terrible 
comeback to El Salvador. Reports suggest that the virus was introduced from 
Europe. Immediate measures taken by the Ministry of Health include an urgent 
information campaign on the issue and the curtailing of its spread by 
quarantining families of effected children. UNICEF is working, together with 
PAHO/WHO, in supporting the action of the Ministry of Health in the areas of 
social mobilization, training of health workers, who are in dear need of 
refresher training courses on the issue of measles, and provision of materials. 
There is no evidence at this moment in time that there will be an 
outbreak.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=+1>Education</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial>Agreement Letter.</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>An Agreement Letter is being finalized with the 
Ministry of Education&#8217;s (MINED) International Cooperation Office, which will 
define the different UNICEF interventions in areas such as psycho-social 
recovery, educational support materials for schools and students, the "Return to 
School, a Commitment of All" national campaign, rehabilitation of the school 
infrastructure, the "Guide for the repair of the most common damages", a 
geo-referenced system and support for the systematization of Information. It has 
been established that the amount for initial support will be 
US$1,200,000.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Rehabilitation of School Infrastructure:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>21 schools were visited from a list suggested by 
MINED, in order to select from them the ones that would be rehabilitated by 
UNICEF. A preliminary selections of the following 14 educational centers has 
been prepared:</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Guide for the Repair of Common Damages in 
Infrastructure</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Based on the proposal guide prepared by the White 
Helmet architects, the technical content of the "Guide for the Repair of Common 
Damages in Infrastructure" is being reviewed by MINED&#8217;s Infrastructure Division. 
Once approved, the material will be published and the Principals of Educational 
Centres will be instructed as to its use. The guide will help them judge 
elements of contracting for repair work, for which they are responsible.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Conversations are also underway with the APREMAT 
project, funded by the European Union, which is interested in supporting this 
initiative since its objective is vocational middle education.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Educational Materials for Schools and 
Students</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The selection of the materials that will comprise 
the "Educational Box" for schools has concluded, and the acquisition process for 
the 1,500 that will be distributed in Educational Centers has begun. Work is 
also in progress for selecting those that will be recipients for these 
materials.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The 10,000 educational back packs will have four 
models: for Preschool, Elementary School, Middle School and Junior High, with 
the contents of each differentiated according to the students&#8217; academic needs. 
The acquisition process is underway. It is expected that students from private 
schools will contribute to the packaging of these back packs.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The number of back packs will be increased by 
10,000 in response to a request made by Monseñor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, 
Archbishop of San Salvador. A coordination mechanism will be set up between 
MINED, the Catholic Church and UNICEF for the distribution of these 
materials.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>On 10 May, the UNICEF Representative and part of the 
emergency team visited Apastepeque in San Vicente and some rural zones in the 
areas where the latest earthquakeic events was particularly strong.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>The main objectives of the visit were to meet the mayor from 
the community, observe the damages of the earthquake recorded on 8 May, and make 
contact with the Education Directors in order to coordinate the realization of a 
series of Psycho-Social Rehabilitation methods for children, called Carrousels. 
This Carrousels will be in 7 different towns on 15, 16 and 21 May. For those 
events, UNICEF asked for teachers and leaders collaboration.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>The Mayor told the UNICEF Representative that the most 
important damages occurred in some broken buildings and that it was not 
necessary to established shelters or emergencies roofs.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In San Jacinto there was a meeting at the central park, 
where the Representative and the Psychologist informed the people about the 
coordination with the National Secretariat for the Family. Also, all children 
were invited to participate in next Carrousels.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On 4 May, UNICEF successfully completed a national 
evaluation of its Psycho-Social Rehabilitation for Children Initiative, the 
first in the Latin American and Caribbean region. More than 4,000 facilitators 
for crisis intervention have been trained, including teachers, youth, community 
leaders, policemen and others. The initiative is being implemented within 
UNICEF/El Salvador&#8217;s emergency cooperation framework, which provides a holistic 
approach to crisis intervention for children in a broad range of governmental 
institutions such as the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Family 
Courts, State Attorney&#8217;s Office, National Police Academy, religious 
organizations, youth groups, NGOs and academic institutions.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>El Salvador&#8217;s Psycho-Social intervention for children 
initiative has also embraced a synergistic institutional commitment for 
emergency preparedness. More than 120 newly trained facilitators, representing 
the more than 4,000 trained in this model, met to analyze the impact of crisis 
intervention on children and to exchange experiences in a national context. 
Follow up mechanisms for guaranteeing children&#8217;s mental health and well being 
include the formulation of institutional policies to guarantee program 
sustainability, national and international cooperation (for example the 
UNICEF/Ministry of Education Cooperation Agreement includes the continued 
training of 35,000 teachers in this model) and a data base. These will ensure 
continued support for emergency preparedness and post-emergency response.</FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Arial>UNICEF´s Representative in El Salvador, joined by the 
Ministry of Education, the Secretariat for the Family and Children and the 
Central American University, highlighted the situation of children in 
emergencies, natural disasters, or regular programming for child protection. The 
psycho-social evaluation and relevant recommendations will be published as a 
national assessment document. This assessment will be presented to government 
officials and other actors for future programming for emergency 
preparedness.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>The alliance proposal with La Prensa Grafica, the newspaper 
with the widest distribution in the country, produced the desired results. The 
newspaper will donate the distribution costs of six special sections and will 
also sponsor the printed advertising. The sections will begin to be published in 
the third week of June. The preparation of an agreement between UNICEF and La 
Prensa Grafica is foreseen. Each special 4-page section deals with issues on 
rights, protection, participation and access to timely information in cases of 
emergency.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On another front, on 4 May, the official presentation of the 
photographic exhibit "Give Joy to their Hearts" was made within the Workshop 
Evaluation Model&#8217;s framework. This exhibit of 8 pictures reflects UNICEF&#8217;s work 
within the emergency in the areas of Health, Education, Psycho-Social 
Rehabilitation and Water and Sanitation.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>On 2 May, in the presence of the Minister of Education, the 
national return to school campaign "School Attendance is a National Commitment" 
was launched at the National Association of Radio Broadcasters&#8217; Headquarters. 
With a large audience of media and special guests, UNICEF and the Ministry of 
Education began this campaign that includes 10 radio spots which are already 
being broadcast from radio stations throughout the country, a television spot 
that is now undergoing editing, and a poster for schools. The campaign carrying 
the slogan "Let there be nobody who can&#8217;t attend school&#8230; you and I will make 
it", also includes the participation of youths from the communities, who will 
act in solidarity brigades going door to door and collecting children that are 
not attending school.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Together with the Central American University, planning is 
underway for a video about the issue of Psycho-Social Rehabilitation that will 
be used during the next training sessions included in this programme.</FONT>
