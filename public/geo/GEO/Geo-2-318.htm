                        <P>Newer technologies that are applied today in Alaska's 
                        expanding North Slope oil fields include directional 
                        drilling that allows for multiple well heads on smaller 
                        drill pads; the re-injection of drilling wastes into the 
                        ground, which replaces surface reserve pits; better 
                        delineation of oil reserves using 3-dimensional seismic 
                        surveys, which has reduced the number of dry holes; and 
                        use of temporary ice pads and ice roads for conducting 
                        exploratory drilling and construction in the winter. As 
                        the oil fields expand east and west, additional oil 
                        reserves are consequently being tapped from smaller 
                        satellite fields that rely on the existing 
                        infrastructure at Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. 
                        <P>Although technological advances in oil and gas 
                        exploration and development have reduced some of the 
                        harmful environmental effects associated with those 
                        activities, oil and gas development remains an intrusive 
                        industrial process. The physical "footprint" of the 
                        existing North Slope oil facilities and roads covers 
                        about 10,000 acres, but the current industrial complex 
                        extends across an 800 square mile region, nearly 100 
                        miles from east to west. It continues to grow as new oil 
                        fields are developed. 
                        <P>The 100-mile wide 1002 Area is located more than 30 
                        miles from the end of the nearest pipeline and more than 
                        50 miles from the nearest gravel road and oil support 
                        facilities. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 
                        possible oil reserves may be located in many small 
                        accumulations in complex geological formations, rather 
                        than in one giant field as was discovered at Prudhoe 
                        Bay. Consequently, development in the 1002 Area would 
                        require a large number of small production sites spread 
                        over a large region, connected by an infrastructure of 
                        roads, pipelines, power plants, processing facilities,

                        <P>In late spring, just as the snow recedes and the 
                        tundra plants turn green, the Porcupine Caribou herd, 
                        numbering 129,000, migrates from south of the Brooks 
                        Range in the Arctic Refuge and Canada to give birth to 
                        their young on the arctic coastal tundra. 
                        <P>The caribou's preferred food during calving season is 
                        higher in nutrition, more digestible, and more available 
                        within the 1002 Area than in surrounding areas. To 
                        successfully reproduce, female caribou must be able to 
                        move freely throughout the 1002 Area to find adequate 
                        food resources to build up their fat reserves and milk. 
                        This allows them to produce healthy calves. Cows with 
                        newborn calves are particularly sensitive, and commonly 
                        move as much as 1.5 miles away from human disturbance. 
                        This has been well-documented in the vicinity of 
                        existing North Slope oil fields. 
                        <P>The Arctic Refuge's coastal plain has been the 
                        birthing ground for the majority of Porcupine Caribou 
                        cows in all but three of the last 18 years. In those 3 
                        years (1987, 1988 and 2000), snow remained on the tundra 
                        longer than usual, forcing the caribou to have their 
                        calves in areas farther east or inland. Calf survival 
                        was poorer in those years due to lower food nutrition 
                        and higher levels of predation.</FONT>

                        the herd has declined since 1992. The Porcupine Caribou

                        development. There are fundamental differences between 
                        the calving areas of these two herds. In the case of the 
                        Central Arctic herd, there is a greater amount of 
                        alternative calving area available for displaced cows to 
                        move to because the mountains are much farther from the 
                        ocean. The 1002 Area is only one-fifth the size of the 
                        area used by the Central Arctic caribou herd, but six 
                        times as many caribou use the 1002 Area. In the Arctic 
                        Refuge, where the mountains are close to the coast, few 
                        alternative areas would be available for displaced cows. 
                        Therefore, development in the 1002 Area would result

                        <P>About 250 muskoxen live year-round in the 1002 area 
                        of the Arctic Refuge. They use smaller areas in winter 
                        when snow limits available habitat. In order to survive 
                        cold weather and poor forage conditions, muskoxen reduce 
                        their activity and movements in winter to conserve 
                        energy. Muskoxen give birth four to six weeks before 
                        summer forage is available. Therefore, females must 
                        maintain body fat throughout the winter to successfully 
                        rear a calf. Calf production and animal survival is 
                        influenced by environmental conditions such as snow 
                        depth and the length of the snow season. In recent 
                        years, the number of muskox calves produced in the 1002 
                        Area has declined. 
                        <P>Muskoxen respond to predators and other disturbances 
                        by moving into a defensive group from which they protect 
                        themselves with sharp horns. If groups are disturbed 
                        enough, they will run. This can result in the deaths of 
                        young calves that are left behind. Muskoxen in the 1002 
                        Area are most frequently found along or adjacent to 
                        large rivers flowing across the coastal plain. If 
                        petroleum exploration and development takes place, these 
                        large rivers are likely sites for gravel and water

                        give birth to cubs build dens in the winter. These

                        <P>135 species of birds are known to use the 1002 Area, 
                        including numerous shorebirds, waterfowl, loons, 
                        songbirds, and raptors. Oil development in the Arctic 
                        Refuge would result in habitat loss, disturbance, and 
                        displacement or abandonment of important nesting, 
                        feeding, molting and staging areas. 
                        <P>One species of bird that could be greatly impacted by 
                        oil development is the snow goose. Large numbers of snow 
                        geese, varying each year from 15,000 to more than 
                        300,000 birds, feed on the Arctic Refuge coastal tundra 
                        for three to four weeks each fall, on their way from 
                        nesting grounds on Banks Island in Canada to wintering 
                        grounds primarily in California's Central Valley. They 
                        feed on cottongrass and other plants to build up fat 
                        reserves in preparation for their journey south, eating 
                        as much as a third of their body weight every day. The 
                        rich vegetation of the coastal tundra enables them to 
                        increase fat reserves by 400% in only two to three 
                        weeks.</P>
                        <P>Snow geese feed on small patches of vegetation that 
                        are widely distributed across the Refuge's coastal 
                        tundra, so a large area is necessary to meet their 
                        needs. They are extremely sensitive to disturbance, 
                        often flying away from their feeding sites when human 
                        activities occur several miles distant. Oil exploration 
                        and development would displace snow geese from areas 
                        that are critically important to them.

                        interpreting the results to construct an image of 
                        subsurface geology to determine if oil may be present. A

                        areas recovered during the first 10 years, some trails 
                        had still not recovered by 1999, 15 years after 
                        disturbance. Some of the trails have become troughs 
                        visible from the air. Others show changes in the amount 
                        and types of tundra plants. In some areas, permafrost 
                        (permanently frozen soil) melted and the trails remain 
                        wetter than they were previously. Some sites will take 
                        decades to recover, if ever.

                        <P>Seismic exploration is conducted every winter on the 
                        North Slope of Alaska, west of the Refuge. New vehicle 
                        tracks and older ones in various stages of recovery are 
                        visible on the tundra in the summer. Today, 
                        3-dimensional (3-D) seismic surveys, as conducted west 
                        of the Refuge boundary, require a much more dense grid 
                        of lines to collect all the data necessary for creating 
                        3-D images of oil reserves. While the 1984-85 2-D trails 
                        on the Arctic Refuge were 4 miles apart, 3-D trails 
                        would be one half mile or less apart. The amount of 
                        damage to vegetation and soils on the Refuge would be 
                        much greater from 3-D seismic surveys than from the 2-D 
                        seismic surveys conducted in the 1980s.

                        <H3>Conclusions</H3>
                        <P>In the 1950's, a group of visionary scientists and 
                        conservationists recognized northeast Alaska as one of 
                        our Nation's last truly wild, natural areas. Since that 
                        time, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge remains a 
                        promise to the American people that this National 
                        natural treasure will be protected. 
                        <P>As one of the Refuge's founders, Supreme Court 
                        Justice William O. Douglas declared "This last American 
                        living wilderness must remain sacrosanct... This is - 
                        and must forever remain - a roadless, primitive area 
                        where all food chains are unbroken, where the ancient 
                        ecological balance provided by nature is maintained." 
                        <P>Biologist Olaus Murie stated that the Arctic Refuge 
                        should be preserved "as a help to us for our 
                        understanding of the natural processes in the 
                        universe... We have only begun to understand the basic 
                        energies which through the ages have made this planet 
                        habitable. If we are wise, we will cherish what we have 
                        left of such places in our land. 
                        <P>During the ANILCA deliberations in the late 1970s, 
                        Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus said: 
                        <P>"In some places, such as the Arctic Range, the 
                        wildlife and natural values are so magnificent and so 
                        enduring that they transcend the value of any mineral 
                        that may lie beneath the surface. Such minerals are 
                        finite. Production inevitably means changes whose 
                        impacts will be measured in geologic time in order to 
                        gain marginal benefits that may last a few years."

                        <P>The Clinton Administration opposes efforts to allow 
                        oil and gas development on the Arctic Refuge's 1002 
                        Area. David Hayes, the Deputy Secretary of the 
                        Department of Interior, recently stated in a 
                        congressional committee hearing that: 
                        <P>"The wildlife and wilderness values of the Refuge are 
                        irreplaceable resources that we have an opportunity to 
                        pass on to future generations. We should not relinquish 
                        that opportunity, particularly in furtherance of a 
                        flawed, short-term response to higher oil prices or an 
                        effort to increase federal revenues. Just as the 
                        Administration does not consider building a dam in the 
                        Grand Canyon during times of drought, we will not 
                        consider opening one of the last pristine ecosystems of 
                        North America during an oil price spike."
