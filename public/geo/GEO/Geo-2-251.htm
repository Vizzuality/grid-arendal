      <H5>It has been emphasised that various areas of the city have particular 
      environmental conditions which increase risks of victimisation and 
      heighten the fear of crime. In particular, high levels of crime in some 
      townships and informal settlements can be linked to specific spatial 
      features. Some of these also occur in inner city areas. While different 
      areas are characterised by different types of crime, fear of crime is the 
      highest in the city centre. Fear of crime is also high in the suburbs, but 
      this does not always reflect the reality of victimisation patterns. This 
      is partly because suburbs have been better designed, are often privately 
      policed and form pockets of comparative safety.<BR><BR>In some cities, the 
      links between features of the environment and crime are recognised. 
      Despite this, there is a poor understanding of the concept of crime 
      prevention through environmental design at local authority level. 
      Interventions thus far have been largely ad hoc and based on particular 
      private sector projects, rather than part of a broader strategy for 
      building safer environments. They have thus concentrated mainly on 
      facilities in affluent sectors of the city which are not most affected by 
      crime, but nevertheless attract disproportionate media attention.<BR><BR>A 
      good example of such an approach is the V&amp;A Waterfront development in 
      Cape Town. A feature of the area is its relative safety: the victimisation 
      that does occur, is restricted mainly to vehicle-related crimes and petty 
      theft. The safety of the Waterfront is the result of a number of factors 
      including isolation from the city centre, which limits pedestrian access. 
      The development can only be reached at this stage through three 
      functioning entrances and does not have multiple points of access like the 
      Durban beachfront. Although there is no formal access control, the design 
      facilitates the monitoring (or the impression that this occurs) of people 
      who enter and leave the complex. Related to this is the fact that access 
      to the Waterfront is designed to favour vehicular rather than pedestrian 
      traffic.<BR><BR>Internally, the Waterfront is characterised by high levels 
      of surveillance, both active and passive. The complex is policed privately 
      by 150 security guards operating 24 hours a day. In addition, 115 hidden 
      CCTV cameras - compared to three in the Cape Town city centre - are 
      present throughout the Waterfront. Since these cameras are concealed, they 
      aim less to prevent crime than to react to it. (In the case of an upmarket 
      development like the Waterfront, a visible presence of CCTV cameras may do 
      more to heighten the fear of crime when the general perception is that 
      crime is low.) The fact that the Waterfront is privately owned, 
      facilitates the success of these measures, since guidelines to assist 
      crime prevention are easier to enforce. Substantial resources have also 
      been allocated to private security, enabling the deployment of three times 
      the number of visible security officers at the Waterfront than South 
      African Police Service (SAPS) officers tasked with visible policing in 
      central Cape Town. Overall, issues of safety are integral to and not 
      separate from the general management of the complex.<BR><BR>Thus, planners 
      and consultants that are working on designing safer environments in South 
      African cities tend to focus on wealthier clients who are often least 
      affected by crime. This does not suggest, however, that environmental 
      design interventions do not serve a purpose in parts of the city where 
      crime levels are comparatively low. This applies particularly to busy 
      urban centres prone to congestion and petty crime. The result is high 
      levels of fear of crime in inner city areas such as central Johannesburg 
      and the beachfront in Durban. Design interventions here are critical for 
      reducing the levels of fear of crime, and as argued above, are likely to 
      be more successful here than in other parts of the city.<BR><BR>In 
      Johannesburg, for example, reducing fear of crime (and not necessarily 
      crime itself) in the Smal Street Mall can be achieved by increased 
      mechanisms of surveillance, such as prominently displayed CCTV cameras, 
      and other visible interventions such as car guards and signs. Some of 
      these measures have been adopted in Safer Cities: Greater Johannesburg, 
      the city's crime prevention strategy.<BR><BR>In Durban, similar 
      initiatives on the beachfront have been identified. A range of 
      interventions have been made by the Durban Corporation in response to a 
      public outcry on the issue. Over the last ten years, the area has been 
      comprehensively redesigned, there is now a network of CCTV cameras, more 
      visible policing by the Durban City Police and the SAPS, a car guard 
      scheme, better lighting and access, and careful landscaping along the 
      beachfront. Ironically, the survey evidence outlined above illustrates 
      that, while these measures have reduced levels of crime (particularly 
      since January 1996) (Figure 22), they have had little impact on the fear 
      of crime. This may be related to overcrowding during peak holiday periods 
      and media coverage of isolated incidents. Greater analysis of how specific 
      interventions in particular contexts could begin to have some impact on 
      high levels of public insecurity is required.<BR><BR><A

      width=450><BR><BR>Given that both crime and the fear of it are high in 
      many townships and informal settlements, design interventions are required 
      here. Ironically (although perhaps predictably), those areas which have 
      had the fewest interventions to enhance safety in the urban environment, 
      are also those which are the least likely to be adequately policed. 
      Policing resources in the country have always disproportionately favoured 
      the suburbs and city centres. Thus, police in townships - and to a lesser 
      extent the inner city areas - tend to be under-resourced, generally 
      unskilled (this is particularly the case in townships where the former 
      municipal and homeland police have been incorporated in the SAPS) and have 
      low morale.<BR><BR>Township policing is characterised by a lack of 
      resources - both human and physical - and poor management of those that 
      are available. In Inanda, for example, the police station staff complement 
      is down to 68 from eighty after racial tensions resulted in the murder of 
      a police captain. Subsequently - and as a temporary measure - a number of 
      officers left the station fearing for their safety, without any immediate 
      replacements. An inner city station at the Point in Durban has not fared 
      any better: the thirty detectives at the station share a load of 2 400 
      dockets. According to the station commissioner, only 15 per cent of the 
      detectives are competent to handle a case. The results are serious morale 
      problems and high absenteeism.<BR><BR>In any event, current policing 
      practices are inhibited by environmental factors in townships and informal 
      settlements, in particular. Their layout and settlement densities combine 
      with topography (particularly around Durban) to make police access 
      difficult. Houses are often not numbered and in some cases can only be 
      reached by particular types of vehicles or on foot. The scarcity of 
      telephones also limits contact between residents and the police. The 
      Durban victim survey suggests that part of the reason for high levels of 
      non-reporting of crime in townships and informal settlements relates to a 
      combination of these factors.<BR><BR>The Johannesburg, Durban and Cape 
      Town victim surveys support the uneven policing hypotheses: African 
      victims and those living in townships, informal settlements and to a 
      lesser extent the inner city, were less likely to believe that the police 
      were effective in their area. Reporting rates were also lower among this 
      group and perceptions were that the police were not able to reduce crime 
      significantly.<BR><BR>It must be emphasised, however, that many 
      environmental design interventions rely on parallel crime prevention 
      activities by the police. These generally take the form of visible 
      policing or patrol interventions. The effectiveness of visible policing in 
      reducing crime has been widely questioned in international policing 
      literature. However, analysts generally agree that if properly conducted, 
      this type of policing can successfully reduce fear of crime. But there is 
      little tradition of visible policing in the SAPS and few resources to 
      conduct it effectively. Even if visible policing was a key strategy, it 
      would be difficult to implement in townships and informal settlements 
      given the environmental factors outlined above.<BR><BR>In areas such as 
      these where policing is weak, environmental design interventions can 
      potentially play a critical role in reducing the chances of victimisation 
      for some categories of crime. But poor policing will generally tend to 
      inhibit the effectiveness of any environmental design intervention. In 
      KwaMashu and Inanda, the limited police involvement in the few planning 
      and development projects that have been implemented, has reduced the 
      effectiveness of these for enhancing community safety.<BR><BR>More 
      generally, the inequitable way in which the South African city has been 
      administered, undermines attempts to govern, let alone offer greater 
      security for communities: local government representatives in township 
      areas (in Durban specifically) do not appear to prioritise crime 
      prevention. The Local Development Objectives (LDO) process, aimed at 
      developing these areas, has prioritised crime as the major issue for these 
      communities. However, local planning agencies are not sure how to respond. 
      This has not improved communities' confidence in the ability of their 
      local council to prevent crime. There is also little participation by the 
      police in this and other planning processes, and planners, in turn, fail 
      to consult the police on how to reduce crime through better 
      design.<BR><BR>This does not mean, though, that environmental design for 
      crime prevention should be de-prioritised in these areas in favour of 
      other crime prevention measures or better policing. At a policy level, 
      interventions based on sound design principles can best be made now. 
      Environmental design principles are most cost effective if implemented 
      during the planning stage rather than afterwards. And once crime levels 
      begin to normalise (as they already have in some parts of the country), 
      the improved physical setting will facilitate activities such as policing, 
      and will support - rather than hinder - crime prevention more generally. 
      While overcrowding and housing quality in some areas are basic qualities 
      of the built environment that are unlikely to be changed overnight, 
      unprecedented opportunities exist to replan parts of South Africa's cities 
      to be safer places.</H5></H5></CENTER></CENTER>
