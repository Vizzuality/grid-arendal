<P>This report is the product of six years of cooperation which began with the 
establishment of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in 1991. 
At that time, Ministers from the eight Arctic countries requested AMAP to 
examine the levels of anthropogenic pollutants and to assess their effects in 
all relevant compartments of the Arctic environment. The Ministers further 
identified the families of pollutants upon which the assessment should 
focus.</P>
<P>This report is intended to be readable and readily comprehensible, and does 
not contain the extensive background data or references to scientific 
literature. The complete scientific documentation, including sources for figures 
reproduced in this report, is contained in a related report, ‘The AMAP 
Assessment Report: Arctic Pollution Issues’, which is fully referenced. For 
readers interested in the scientific basis behind the AMAP assessment, we 
recommend that you refer to the AMAP Assessment Report.</P>
<P>A large number of experts from the Arctic countries (Canada, 
Denmark/Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the United 
States), from indigenous peoples organizations, from other international 
organizations, and from Germany, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom, have 
participated in the preparation of the AMAP assessment. </P>
<P>AMAP would like to express its appreciation to all of these experts, who have 
contributed their time, effort, and data; especially those involved in the 
planning and conduct of the monitoring and research work that has been 
fundamental to this assessment. A list of the main contributors is included in 
the acknowledgements on the next page of this report. The list is based on 
identified individual contributers to the AMAP scientific assessment, and is not 
comprehensive. Specifically, it does not include the many national institutes, 
laboratories and organizations, and their staff, which have been involved in the 
various countries. Apologies, and no lesser thanks, are given to any individuals 
unintentionally omitted from the list.</P>
<P>Special thanks are due to the lead authors responsible for preparing the AMAP 
scientific assessment, and, in particular, to Annika Nilsson, who has written 
this report in close cooperation with the lead authors and the AMAP Secretariat, 
and who has managed the difficult task of summarizing more than 1000 pages of 
background scientific documentation in this comprehensive report.</P>
<P>The monitoring and research activities, and parts of the assessment, have 
been conducted as national contributions to the work of AMAP. However, the 
assessment would not have been possible without additional financial support for 
this work from Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the United States, the Nordic 
Council of Ministers, and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). 
These contributions have made it possible, amongst other things, for experts 
from Arctic indigenous peoples organizations to play an active role in this 
work.</P>
<P>The AMAP Working Group that was established to complete this work is pleased 
to present its assessment for consideration by governments of the Arctic 
countries. This report is prepared in English and translated into several 
languages. The English version constitutes the official version.</P>

<P>1. The Arctic and the role of AMAP</P></B></I>
<P>The Arctic is characterized by a harsh climate with extreme variation in 
light and temperature, short summers, extensive snow and ice cover in winter and 
large areas of permafrost. The plants and animals of the Arctic have adapted to 
these conditions, but these adaptations have in some cases rendered them more 
sensitive to human activities. Human activities both inside and outside the 
Arctic influence the physical, chemical and biological nature of Arctic 
ecosystems.</P>
<P>Arctic cultures remain vital and resilient, despite tremendous social, 
demographic, and technological changes during the twentieth century. The lives 
of indigenous and other Arctic peoples are closely linked to local resources, 
particularly by their dependence on wildlife harvesting, which form a basis for 
indigenous society, cultures, and economies. Spiritual ties to the environment 
are strong. A diet based on traditional foods has high nutritional benefit and 
provides the necessary dietary intake of most vitamins, essential elements and 
minerals. However, this assessment shows that certain Arctic population groups 
are among the most exposed populations in the world to certain environmental 
contaminants. Some of these contaminants are carried to the Arctic via 
long-range transport and accumulate in animals that are used as traditional 
foods. Some contaminants also have significant sources within the Arctic, giving 
rise to serious concerns in certain local and sub-regional areas.</P>
<P>The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), established in 1991 
under the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS), was given the 
responsibility to monitor the levels and assess the effects of selected 
anthropogenic pollutants in all compartments of the Arctic. This is the first 
AMAP assessment report, and it represents a collaborative effort involving over 
400 scientists and administrators. It is based on AMAP-coordinated national and 
international monitoring programs within the eight Arctic countries, in 
combination with data and information from several research programs, including 
contributions from non-Arctic countries and international organizations. Details 
relating to the Conclusions and Recommendations presented here can be found in 
the following sections of this report and in ‘<I>The AMAP Assessment Report: 
Arctic Pollution Issues’</I>.</P><B><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>
<P><A name=conclusions>Conclusions</A></P></B></FONT>
<P>In comparison with most other areas of the world, the Arctic remains a clean 
environment. However, the following conclusions illustrate that, for some 
pollutants, combinations of different factors give rise to concern in certain 
ecosystems and for some human populations. These circumstances sometimes occur 
on a local scale, but in some cases may be regional or circumpolar in 
extent.</P><B><I>
<P>2. Contaminant sources and pathways</P>
<P>2.1. Sources of contamination</P></B></I>
<P>Knowledge of sources of contamination of the Arctic is improving and in some 
cases the information is quantified. The pattern that is emerging is of two 
major types of source - sources remote from the Arctic and sources found within 
the Arctic.</P><B><I>
<P>Summary conclusions concerning sources outside the Arctic:</P>
<UL></B></I>
  <LI>Outside of the Arctic, sources exist for a number of the persistent 
  organic pollutants (POPs); the main contaminants of concern are: 
  organochlorine pesticides (e.g., HCH) and their metabolites from agricultural 
  activities/practices; industrial chemicals (e.g., PCBs); and anthropogenic and 
  natural combustion products, e.g. chlorinated dioxins/furans and polycyclic 
  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 
  <LI>Over much of the Arctic, the levels of POPs cannot be related to known use 
  and/or releases from potential sources within the Arctic and can only be 
  explained by long-range transport from lower latitudes. 
  <LI>Radioactive contamination has arisen from three primary sources: 
  atmospheric nuclear weapons testing (1950-1980); releases from European 
  nuclear reprocessing plants, e.g. Sellafield, which peaked in the mid-1970s; 
  and fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. 
  <LI>Of the heavy metal contamination in the Arctic, industrial sources in 
  Europe and North America account for up to one-third of the deposition, with 
  maximum input in winter. 
  <LI>Sulfur and nitrogen compounds from sources associated with industries, 
  energy production and transport in areas remote from the Arctic result in low 
  but widespread levels of these contaminants throughout the Arctic. 
  <LI>Regulatory actions in Europe and North America are reducing the sources of 
  some POPs, heavy metals, sulfur and nitrogen contaminants.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>Summary conclusions concerning sources within, or in close proximity to, the 
Arctic:</P>
<UL></B></I>
  <LI>PCBs from decommissioned DEW (Distant Early Warning) Line sites in Canada, 
  and dioxins/furans from smelters in Norway are examples of identified sources 
  of POPs within the Arctic; other such sources probably exist but are presently 
  unknown. 
  <LI>Two-thirds of heavy metals in air in the High Arctic originate from 
  industrial activities on the Kola Peninsula, the Norilsk industrial complex, 
  the Urals (outside the Arctic) and the Pechora Basin. 
  <LI>At point sources such as mine sites, heavy metals may exceed local 
  background concentrations at distances up to 30 km from the site. 
  <LI>Mineralization of geological formations provides significant, 
  non-anthropogenic local inputs of heavy metals. 
  <LI>Industrial activities in northwestern Russia, including the Kola 
  Peninsula, and at Norilsk are the dominant sources of sulfur north of 60Ý. 
  <LI>Severe local and regional problems have occurred recently, associated with 
  the exploration, development, and transportation of oil and gas. 
  <LI>With the exception of catastrophic releases of oil, concentrations of 
  hydrocarbons associated with anthropogenic inputs have been relatively low in 
  the Arctic. 
  <LI>Local sources of radionuclides, such as dumped nuclear waste, nuclear 
  storage sites, accidents and past explosions, have led to local radioactive 
  contamination. 
  <LI>There exists a high concentration of radioactive sources in northwestern 
  Russia. These sources represent a potential for release of considerable 
  quantities of radionuclides.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>2.2. Contaminant pathways</P></B></I>
<P>The Arctic is a focus for major atmospheric, riverine, and marine pathways 
which result in the long-range transport of contaminants into and within the 
Arctic. The Arctic is, therefore, a potential contaminant storage reservoir and/ 
or sink. Various processes remove these contaminants from the atmosphere, oceans 
and rivers and make them available to plants and animals. Food chains are the 
major biological pathways for selective uptake, transfer, and sometimes 
magnification of contaminants by Arctic plants and animals, many of which are 
subsequently consumed by Arctic peoples.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Strong south to north air flows, particularly over west Eurasia in winter, 
  transport contaminants, e.g., sulfur and nitrogen compounds, POPs, and 
  radionuclides, from lower latitudes. Special mechanisms selectively favor the 
  accumulation of PCBs and certain pesticides in the Arctic. 
  <LI>Arctic rivers are a significant pathway for contaminant transport to the 
  Arctic, often associated with extreme seasonal fluctuations due to freeze-up 
  and meltwater flushing characteristics. Suspended solids carry high levels of 
  PCB and DDT in the Ob and Yenisey river deltas, as do sediments in the 
  Indigirka and Pechora rivers. Sedimentation processes play a critical role in 
  depositing particles in estuaries, deltas, and Arctic coastal shelves. These 
  riverine pathways lead to local and regional dispersal of radionuclides, some 
  heavy metals, and oil. 
  <LI>Ocean waters are a major storage reservoir and transport medium for water 
  soluble POPs. Sea ice may be important in transporting POPs and other 
  contaminants from coastal sediments during the winter, and from deposition 
  from the atmosphere, with subsequent redistribution during ice melt. 
  <LI>Long distance marine transport of radionuclides from previous mid-latitude 
  releases resulted in accumulations in Arctic sediments. Radionuclides from 
  current releases from spent fuel storage and wastes dumped at sea, tend to 
  remain local, although low-active liquid wastes dumped previously in the 
  Arctic marine environment have been distributed more widely.</LI></UL>
<P>In marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, contaminants are 
selectively taken up by microorganisms and higher plants from water, sediment 
and soils. Consumption by herbivores and carnivores results in the transfer of 
contaminants, and in some cases increased concentrations (biomagnification), 
within the food webs. Food web structure and length of the food chain, 
therefore, significantly influence the transfer and redistribution of 
contaminants within the Arctic.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Freshwater and marine ecosystems contain higher levels of POPs than 
  terrestrial ecosystems due to longer and more complex food webs. 
  Biomagnification of POPs is especially significant in food webs dominated by 
  organisms with high fat contents. Many upper trophic level carnivores are 
  long-lived and may transfer POPs to offspring during extended gestation and 
  lactation. 
  <LI>In several marine mammals, geographical differences in contamination, 
  e.g., cadmium and mercury contamination, may be explained by differences in 
  geology, diet, and growth processes related to temperature. Biomagnification 
  of metals is often very selective, e.g., there is no indication that lead, and 
  selenium, levels increase in higher trophic levels although cadmium and 
  mercury clearly do. 
  <LI>Some species and/or their prey contain large metal and POP burdens from 
  overwintering at lower latitudes and deliver these to the Arctic on their 
  return in the summer. 
  <LI>Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems contain higher levels of those 
  radionuclides that are important in relation to human exposure, than do marine 
  ecosystems.</LI></UL>
<P>The combination of long-range transport processes, climate conditions and 
physical, chemical and biological properties results in the accumulation of some 
contaminants in traditional foods at levels often exceeding those in foods from 
outside of the Arctic.</P><B><I>
<P>3. Contamination levels, trends and effects</P>
<P>3.1. Sensitive species, processes, and systems</P></B></I>
<P>Low temperatures, extreme seasonal variations in light, and lack of nutrients 
are some of the physical and chemical characteristics which cause environmental 
stress to organisms, limit productivity of Arctic ecosystems, and make them 
potentially more vulnerable to environmental contaminants. There is considerable 
variability among species in their exposure and response to different 
contaminants, and their rate of recovery from the effects of exposure. Apart 
from areas of intense local contamination, the major concern at present is 
focused on PCBs and pesticides, mainly because of the sensitivity of species to 
these contaminants and the biological processes which enhance levels and 
effects.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The most exposed animals to many contaminants are those high in the food 
  webs, such as marine mammals, including polar bears, and birds of prey, but 
  also some fish species. 
  <LI>Contaminant levels in some Arctic birds and mammals exceed some thresholds 
  associated with reproductive, immunosuppressive, and neurobehavioral effects 
  in laboratory animals and some studied wildlife species. Besides eggshell 
  thinning in some Arctic predatory birds from DDE , other subtle biological 
  effects have been seen in a few studied Arctic mammal species. These effects 
  appear to be associated with high levels of POPs, particularly PCBs. 
  <LI>Biomagnification is a major factor influencing species exposure, with the 
  long, marine-based food webs being particularly vulnerable. In contrast, 
  migratory birds are vulnerable through overwintering in polluted environments 
  at mid-latitudes and/or from consumption of other contaminated migratory 
  birds. 
  <LI>Based on a few dated sediment core studies and long-term temporal trend 
  monitoring in fish and seabird eggs, levels of PCBs and DDT decreased in the 
  subarctic from the 1970s to the 1980s. However, trends for the 1980s to 1990s 
  are less obvious and more difficult to interpret. Long-term data on time 
  trends in the High Arctic are lacking. 
  <LI>Cadmium levels are high enough in some terrestrial and marine birds and 
  mammals to pose a threat of kidney damage. 
  <LI>Mercury seems to be increasing in aquatic sediments and in marine mammals. 
  It is biomagnified but its effects appear to be suppressed by current levels 
  of selenium.</LI></UL>
<P>In addition to assessing the potential effects of contaminants on Arctic 
ecosystems, increases in UV-B radiation represent a new challenge. Arctic 
organisms are particularly susceptible because they normally live with low 
radiation levels and, unlike alpine species, are not adapted to resist damage. 
Additionally, repair processes are slower than damage, and adaptation is slow in 
long-lived organisms. Thus, 1) algae and other microrganisms in terrestrial and 
aquatic systems are sensitive to UV-B, but can adapt through short generation 
times; 2) fish larvae are vulnerable when they are exposed to UV-B in shallow 
waters, and fish can show skin and gill lesions; and 3) terrestrial mammals, 
like humans, are sensitive.</P><B><I>
<P>3.2. Geographical areas of concern</P></B></I>
<P>Contaminants are widely, but not uniformly, distributed around the Arctic. 
Geographical variation in levels results from point sources of contamination, 
which result in high local pollution concentrations, and from environmental 
convergence mechanisms, e.g., convergence of physical pathways or areas of 
sediment accretion. Geographical variation in sensitivity for effects results 
from environmental conditions which make similar concentrations bioavailable in 
one area but not in another, and, among humans, variations in production, 
harvesting and utilization of traditional foods.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Industries on the Kola Peninsula, Norilsk, and eastern Finnmark emit a 
  wide spectrum of major local pollutants, resulting in strong spatial gradients 
  along atmospheric, terrestrial, riverine and marine pathways. Effects can be 
  locally catastrophic and subregionally damaging, e.g., areas adjacent to 
  nickel smelters. 
  <LI>PCB and DDT levels in suspended solids in the Ob and Yenisey river deltas 
  and sediments in the Indigirka and Pechora rivers are high, even compared to 
  urban areas in temperate regions. 
  <LI>Levels of PCB and DDT seem to be higher in both biotic and abiotic media 
  around Svalbard, the southern Barents Sea, and eastern Greenland than in the 
  Canadian High Arctic. Levels of HCH seem to be higher in the Canadian Arctic. 
  Causes and mechanisms in focusing these and similar important contaminants are 
  not fully understood. Other such regions may exist, but inadequate data 
  coverage, in particular for Alaska and parts of Russia, may mean that all such 
  areas have not yet been identified. 
  <LI>Soils and freshwaters are particularly sensitive to acidification in areas 
  where the soils are acid, shallow and poor in bases. Most of northern 
  Fennoscandia, the northern part of the Kola Penninsula, and parts of the 
  Canadian Shield are therefore vulnerable to relatively low inputs of 
  atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen. 
  <LI>Areas with surface organic layers, subject to little mixing with 
  underlying mineral layers, show much higher transfer of radionuclides into 
  food chains than do areas with mineral-rich soils in which the radionuclides 
  are immobilized.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>3.3. Human exposure</P></B></I>
<P>Several groups of people in the Arctic are highly exposed to environmental 
contaminants. Persistent contaminants, derived from long-range transport or 
local sources, accumulate in animals that are used as traditional foods. Thus, 
variation in human exposure depends on a combination of (1) varying 
environmental concentrations of contaminants, (2) local physical and biological 
pathways which make the contaminants available, and (3) the local dietary habits 
of the people.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Exposure to persistent organic pollutants is the primary concern. People 
  are most exposed to PCBs and certain pesticides through the long marine food 
  webs which result in high concentrations in mammals, birds and, to a lesser 
  extent, fish. The use of different foods determines contaminant intake. Some 
  indigenous groups are exposed to levels that exceed established tolerable 
  intake levels. Transfer to infants can result in levels in newborns which are 
  2-10 times higher than in regions further south. 
  <LI>Exposure to radionuclides is mainly through atmospheric transfer and 
  deposition to terrestrial ecosystems. Particular soil and vegetation 
  characteristics concentrate some radionuclides, enabling high concentrations 
  to develop in plants and animals (reindeer/caribou, game, mushrooms). Arctic 
  people are generally exposed to higher levels of radionuclides than people in 
  temperate zones. 
  <LI>Of the heavy metals, both cadmium and mercury tend to accumulate in the 
  long marine food webs. Methylmercury, partly because it is fat-soluble, is 
  efficiently taken up following consumption and therefore poses the main 
  potential risk. Like POPs, methylmercury can be transferred to the fetus and 
  to breast-fed children, and in certain areas, levels are high enough to 
  indicate a need for public health measures. Although mercury levels can be 
  high, interaction with selenium may reduce the risk to people. 
  <LI>Enhanced UV-B radiation, resulting from pollution at lower latitudes, 
  directly exposes humans. The main concerns relate to possible ocular damage 
  and additional immunosuppressive effects and dermatological disorders. 
  <LI>Controls on emissions have resulted in measurable reductions in input of 
  some contaminants (e.g., lead, radionuclides, atmospheric sulfur, and possibly 
  PCBs and DDT). There is considerable variation across the Arctic, however, and 
  recycling of accumulated pools of long-lived contaminants can result in 
  continued exposure long after controls have been enforced.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>4. Potential threats</P></B></I>
<P>Emerging potential changes in contaminant sources and pathways include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Production and use of ‘new’ organic chemicals, including new generation 
  pesticides. 
  <LI>Increased emissions of heavy metals and other elements or compounds from 
  increased development of industries within the Arctic and developing regions 
  outside the Arctic (e.g., Southeast Asia). 
  <LI>Release of radionuclides, hydrocarbons, and POPs through accidents during 
  production, transport, waste disposal, and storage, including existing dumps 
  (e.g., leakage from landfill sites). 
  <LI>Unexpected natural events, e.g., floods, storms, volcanic eruptions, and 
  earthquakes, which cause release, mobilize, or redistribute contaminants. 
  <LI>Unexpected interactions between contaminants, or between a contaminant and 
  particular environmental conditions, may significantly change contaminant 
  mobility through food webs. 
  <LI>UV-B, which is the main toxic exposure showing an increasing trend in the 
  Arctic. This affects Arctic organisms and humans directly. Additionally, the 
  response of organisms may alter the structure, composition and functioning of 
  ecosystems with consequences for humans. 
  <LI>Climate change, which is of immediate interest to the Arctic. There is 
  considerable uncertainty in the predicted long-term climate change, and thus 
  the consequences of these changes, whether due to natural or anthropogenic 
  influences, remain unknown. The mobilization/immobilization of contaminants 
  following warming; altered redistribution of contaminants through changes in 
  oceanic and air currents; changes in biological pathways through changes in 
  species composition of plant and animal communities, etc., are all examples of 
  possible consequences which cannot yet be determined. 
  <LI>Accidental releases, for which the extreme environmental conditions and 
  isolated localities in much of the Arctic greatly increase the difficulties of 
  detection and taking remedial measures.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>5. Gaps in current understanding</P></B></I>
<P>Current understanding of transport processes and the ability to quantify them 
is inadequate. In particular, determination of transport processes and their 
relative importance or magnitude within and between compartments (air, land, 
water, ice, sediments and biota) is essential. Specific gaps and needs 
concern:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Contaminant inputs to the Arctic from various sources and pathways, 
  including increased knowledge of local sources within the Arctic, which may as 
  yet be unknown or insufficiently quantified. 
  <LI>Poor understanding of pathways of transport and deposition of heavy 
  metals, POPs, petroleum hydrocarbons and radionuclides, from land to rivers, 
  estuaries, deltas and the continental shelf. In particular, determining 
  contaminant focusing zones (i.e., zones of convergence of contaminant 
  transport pathways) and understanding the processes of sequestration by 
  sediments need further attention. The use of natural and anthropogenic tracers 
  to mimic contaminants and distinguish sources has been underutilized. 
  <LI>Ocean transport processes for different contaminants, including ice 
  transport and subsequent contaminant release in melting (focusing) zones. 
  <LI>Improved understanding of the influence of Arctic conditions, especially 
  temperature and light, on the transformation and fate of contaminants. 
  <LI>Understanding of the changes in contaminant concentrations, 
  transformations, and interactions that occur within food web pathways, 
  including dynamics of the transfer of radionuclides into traditional foods 
  arising from both terrestrial and freshwater pathways. 
  <LI>Information on contaminant levels and trends, which is still lacking for 
  certain contaminants and media in certain areas. 
  <LI>Long-term trends in levels of contaminants in different compartments, 
  especially in biota. 
  <LI>Better understanding of physiological and toxicological effects of 
  contaminants on humans and species identified as most at risk, especially on 
  development of offspring, and/or immunosuppression and endocrine disrupting 
  properties 
  <LI>Detailed information on the diet and food consumption patterns of specific 
  Arctic populations, including necessary information on other factors (e.g., 
  smoking) which can influence contaminant exposures, to allow better estimates 
  of dietary intakes of contaminants and permit more reliable estimates of 
  associated risks. 
  <LI>Integration of physical and biological models with information on 
  environmental measurements of sources and pathways, to aid the design and 
  implementation of monitoring, research, and management , including mitigation. 

  <LI>Assessment of the probability and impact of release from operations 
  involving radionuclides, other than waste dumping at sea, and identification 
  of appropriate management options. 
  <LI>Knowledge about combined effects of contaminants on biota and humans, both 
  at the individual and ecosystem level. 
  <LI>Knowledge about combined effects between climate change and contaminant 
  pathways, including improvements of models for assessments. Existing models on 
  climate change and transport processes do not have the resolution and accuracy 
  needed to fully assess environmental consequences of anthropogenic emissions 
  to the Arctic.</LI></UL><B><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>

<UL>
  <LI>Consumption of traditional food continues, with recognition that there is

  <LI>Breast feeding should continue to be promoted.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>6.2. Indigenous Peoples</P></B></I>
<P>To ensure the interest and active involvement of Arctic indigenous peoples 
and other Arctic residents, the Arctic countries should:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Improve the use of indigenous knowledge in environmental research, 
  including local participation, and policy. 
  <LI>Establish a long-term communication program to provide public information 
  concerning environmental contaminants, linked to AMAP, which gives access to 
  sound and regularly updated information in an understandable language. 
  <LI>Integrate contamination issues for different educational levels in order 
  to raise general environmental and scientific literacy among Arctic residents, 
  including indigenous peoples.</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>7. Source – receptor relationship</P></B></I>
<P>To develop international strategies to protect the Arctic from environmental 
contamination, the input to and the significance of the different pathways to 
the Arctic must be better quantified:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Procedures for source apportionment of contaminants need to be further 
  developed to better identify the magnitude and relative contribution over time 
  from natural and anthropogenic sources. 
  <LI>Procedures for the improved quantification and reporting on anthropogenic 
  emissions need to be developed to better quantify inputs to the Arctic, 
  including potential releases from nuclear sources. 
  <LI>Procedures need to be developed to identify the fraction of contaminants 
  entering the Arctic as the result of current usage or recent emissions. 
  <LI>The significant transport processes distributing contaminants within the 
  Arctic need to be quantified; in particular, the contaminant transformations 
  and interactions within the food web pathway need to be better understood and, 
  if possible, quantified. 
  <LI>Improved information is needed on potential releases of radionuclides and 
  their subsequent behavior in the terrestrial and freshwater environments. 
  <LI>Further development of existing models (atmospheric and oceanographic) to 
  simulate/predict the transport of and exposure from contaminants to and within 
  the Arctic and their use together with appropriate analytical tools (such as 
  Geographical Information Systems), is required to better define action plans 
  and priorities (e.g., emission controls, critical loads, dietary advice, 
  etc.).</LI></UL><B><I>
<P>8. Contaminant levels, trends and effects</P></B></I>
<P>There exists uncertainty as to whether or not the levels of some 
environmental contaminants are decreasing. It is essential that temporal trends 
be intensively monitored in appropriate abiotic and biotic media at a few key 
locations, and occasionally over wider areas. Such programs necessarily imply a 
long-term monitoring commitment. In this context, the next phase of AMAP should 
promote the design and establishment of a coordinated circumpolar network of 
long-term reference monitoring sites to include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Consideration of the establishment of additional air monitoring master 
  stations to fill geographical gaps and complement existing sites. 
  <LI>Continuation of existing time trend series which have proven to be useful 
  and informative, while replacing those that have generated less useful data 
  with more appropriate monitoring strategies. 
  <LI>Investigation of levels and trends of radionuclides in flora and fauna 
  relevant to assessing the radiation exposure and effects on ecosystems, and 
  not only those biota relevant to human exposure. 
  <LI>Retrospective time trend techniques (e.g., soil, sediment and ice-core 
  studies, analysis of specimen bank samples). 
  <LI>The use of specimen banks for archiving abiotic and biotic 
samples.</LI></UL>
<P>Processes behind trends for heavy metals should be studied to resolve the 
relative impacts of significant natural or anthropogenic sources.</P>
<P>There is a need to obtain a spatial distribution of the magnitude of 
contaminant levels on a circumpolar basis. Priority should be given to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Significant data gaps, particularly from the United States and Russian 
  sites. 
  <LI>Metals (mercury and cadmium), and POPs in organisms for which there are 
  concerns for biological effects.</LI></UL>
<P>Chemical and biological effect monitoring should be encouraged:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In Arctic species having body burdens of POPs, cadmium and mercury levels 
  at or above levels of concern. 
  <LI>In small Arctic streams where acidification is considered most likely to 
  occur first.</LI></UL>
<P>There is a need for improved information on spatial and temporal trends to 
clarify the adverse effects of POPs, methylmercury, and cadmium on human 
populations, especially on child development. The relative importance of local 
and distant, and natural and anthropogenic sources of heavy metals in the Arctic 
that are causing elevated dietary exposures should be determined.</P>
<P>Surveys of tributyltin (TBT) in harbor sediments in the Arctic should be 
carried out to assess the extent of TBT contamination.</P>
<P>In regions of existing or developing oil and gas exploitation and 
transportation in the Arctic:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Steps should be taken to harmonize the monitoring of petroleum hydrocarbon 
  levels and effects. 
  <LI>It is recommended that nautical charts and environmental sensitivity 
  mapping for the Arctic area be improved as an important counter-measure for 
  oil spills. 
  <LI>Methods and techniques for combating oil spills in ice-covered areas 
  should be developed to reduce damage when spills occur.</LI></UL>
<P>To ensure intercomparability, future AMAP monitoring programs should continue 
to address and include improved quality assurance/quality control protocols, 
possibly linked to other international programs, for:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Sampling and analysis, including interlaboratory comparison; storage and 
  archiving of samples; and handling, reporting and analysis of data.</LI></UL>
<P>For emergency preparedness, it is important to identify areas vulnerable to 
contamination, especially oil and radioactive contamination. Environmental 
sensitivity mapping should be improved and completed.</P><B><I>
<P>9. Remedial actions relating to contaminants</P></B></I>
<P>The Arctic countries should take all necessary steps to ensure that their 
domestic responsibilities and arrangements to reduce contaminant inputs to the 
Arctic region are fully implemented. If these responsibilities and arrangements 
are not addressed in an appropriate manner, the justification for recommending 
actions aimed at reducing transboundary contaminants with sources outside of the 
Arctic will be accordingly diminished. There is a need for actions to clean up 
contaminants from industrial and military sites and to reduce risk of nuclear 
accidents and radioactive releases and oil pollution in the Arctic.</P>
<P>The AMAP countries, all being parties to the Convention on Long-range 
Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP), should work vigorously for the expeditious 
completion of negotiations for the three protocols presently being prepared. 
These include a second nitrogen protocol, a protocol to initially focus upon the 
heavy metals cadmium, mercury, and lead, and a protocol on POPs. The protocols 
should apply throughout the full extent of the geographic area covered by the 
Convention, and not be restricted to the areas covered by the European 
Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). In addition, the AMAP countries 
should strongly support the work of the international negotiating committee, to 
be established early in 1998 following a decision of the Governing Council of 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), to prepare an international, 
legally-binding global agreement on controls for twelve specified POPs.</P>
<P>All Arctic countries should demonstrate leadership by ratifying the second 
sulfur Protocol under the LRTAP Convention.</P>
<P>The LRTAP protocol under negotiation for heavy metals can only address 
emissions to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources. Where there are cases of 
transboundary effects in the Arctic resulting from releases to the aquatic or 
terrestrial environment, AMAP countries should explore other appropriate 
mechanisms to address these concerns, including other legal mechanisms. AMAP 
countries which are party to other international agreements aiming at reductions 
in releases to the environment of heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and POPs should 
strongly support implementation plans of those agreements where these actions 
will lead to improvements in the Arctic environment (e.g., the London Dumping 
Convention, the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL Convention, the 
Oslo-Paris Convention for the North East Atlantic Ocean, etc.).</P>
<P>Compliance with existing legal instruments appears to be an issue for 
contemporary international agreements, and guidance on radiation protection, 
nuclear safety, radioactive waste management, and emergency preparedness should 
be rigorously adhered to by all Arctic countries to minimize the probabilities 
and consequences of accidents. In addition, international recommendations 
regarding the improvement of nuclear and radiation safety in the nuclear 
industry, which cover reactor refueling, decommissioning and associated spent 
fuel storage and disposal operations, should be extended to, and implemented in, 
all nuclear fleet operations. Efforts to reduce risk for nuclear accidents and 
radioactivity releases should be continued and strengthened. Nevertheless, it is 
recommended that the Arctic countries cooperate to ensure that existing 
regulations are followed in future developments and are reviewed to ensure full 
accounting for the extreme conditions found in the Arctic.</P>
<P>Arctic countries should support the implementation of the Montreal Protocol 
(on ozone-depleting substances) and the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.</P>
<P>Levels of many contaminants in the Arctic are likely to remain at or close to 
existing levels for decades because of their resistance to degradation, the slow 
rate of degradative processes, and the recycling of existing accumulations. 
Thus, ameliorative actions to reduce exposure to humans and to protect wildlife 
are an essential adjunct to emission controls.</P>
