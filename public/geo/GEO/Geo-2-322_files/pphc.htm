  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics was 
  entrusted with the census process in 1993 by the Palestinian National 
  Authority (PNA).<BR></FONT></P>

  scientifically accepted sets of data on population size, composition and

  fostering a series of dialogues with governmental, business, and community 
  groups so that census output will meet user requirements. <BR></FONT></P></OL>
