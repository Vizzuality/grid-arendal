      <P class=justify>In February 1976, the coastal States of the Mediterranean 
      region, by adopting the <B><A 
      href="http://www.rempec.org/barcelona.html">Protocol Concerning 
      Co-operation in Combating Pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by Oil and 
      Other Harmful Substances in Cases of Emergency</A></B>, committed 
      themselves to inform each other, either directly or through the Regional 
      <B><A href="http://www.rempec.org/about_rempec.html">Centre</A></B>, of 
      all accidents causing or likely to cause pollution of the sea by oil or 
      other hazardous substances and of the presence of spillages observed at 
      sea, as well as of their assessments and actions taken to respond to the 
      pollution and the evolution of the situation.</P>
      <P class=justify>According to the Guidelines for Co-operation in Combating 
      Oil Pollution (adopted in 1987) the Parties to the Protocol will report to 
      the Regional Centre, at least all spillages or discharges of oil in excess 
      of 100 cubic metres, as soon as they have knowledge of them.</P>
      <P class=justify>The Centre started collecting data on oil spills and 
      accidents likely to cause spillages in August 1977. Since 1989, all these 
      data have been stored in the Centre's databank. The list is permanently 
      updated and thoroughly revised on a regular basis. Information on each 
      accident recorded in the list includes information on the date and place 
      of the spill or accident, the ship(s) or installation(s) involved, the 
      source of information, the type and quantity of pollutant, a brief 
      description of the accident and, when available, of actions taken and 
      consequences of the accident.</P>
      <P class=justify>In the beginning of 1993 the list was subject to a major 
      revision. The accidents involving oil and those involving other hazardous 
      substances, which had previously been listed together, have now been 
      separated. In addition, all previously listed accidents which actually 
      occurred outside the Mediterranean Sea as defined by the Barcelona 
      Convention, have been removed from the list. The figures concerning the 
      quantities of oil spilled in some of the accidents have been revised in 
      accordance with the most recent figures resulting from official 
      inquiries.&nbsp; 
      <P class=justify><IMG align=right alt="mediterranean sea accident" 
      height=172 src="Geo-2-265_files/IH033476_wm.jpe" width=256>On several 
      occasions the Centre was involved in accidents occurring outside the 
      Mediterranean, as defined for the purposes of the Convention, which were 
      affecting one of the Contracting Parties to the Emergency Protocol of the 
      Barcelona Convention. Accordingly, these accidents have also been listed 
      and included in the document.&nbsp; 
      <P class=justify>The first part of the document contains:&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=prose><B>a) LIST A :</B> The list of accidents reported to REMPEC 
      between August 1977 and December 1997 which caused or might have caused 
      pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by <U>oil</U>.</P>
      <P class=prose><B>b) LIST B : </B>The list of accidents reported to REMPEC 
      between January 1988 and December 1997 which caused or might have caused 
      pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by <U>hazardous substances</U> other 
      than oil.</P>
      <P class=prose><B>c) LIST C :</B> The list of accidents which occurred 
      outside the Mediterranean and threatened one or more countries, 
      Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention, and in which the Centre 
      was involved.</P>
      <P class=justify>The second part of the document is a brief analysis of 
      the situation regarding accidental pollution of the Mediterranean Sea as 
      at 1<SUP>st</SUP> of January 1998.</P>
      <P class=justify>The "<B>List of Alerts and Accidents in the Mediterranean 
      Sea</B>" forms Section 4 of Part C of the <B><A 
      href="http://www.rempec.org/ris.html">Regional Information System</A></B>. 
      It is aimed at providing national authorities in the Mediterranean 
      countries with a tool which should be used in conjunction with other data, 
      such as those relating to maritime transportation of oil and chemical 
      substances, to identify more precisely the risk of accidental pollution 
      and subsequently to facilitate taking appropriate measures concerning 
      preparedness and response at both national and regional levels.</P>
