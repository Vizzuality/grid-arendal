<H1>Preface</H1>
<P>This volume, Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, is 
the Working Group II (WGII) contribution to the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The companion volumes of 
the TAR are Climate Change 2001: the Scientific Basis (WGI) and Climate Change 
2001: Mitigation (WGIII). A fourth volume of the TAR is being prepared to 
provide a synthesis of the findings of the three Working Groups and will focus 
on questions addressing particular policy issues raised in the context of the 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.<BR></P>
<P>Since the inception of the IPCC, its Working Group II has focused on the 
impacts of projected climate change. The current WGII report differs somewhat in 
scope from earlier WGII assessments. This report examines climate change 
impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability across a range of systems and sectors, as 
was done in the Second Assessment Report (SAR, published in 1996), and includes 
a regional assessment, updated from the Special Report on Regional Impacts of 
Climate Change (1998). Environmental, social, and economic dimensions of these 
issues are assessed in this report, whereas the previous WGII report focused 
primarily on environmental dimensions. Efforts are made in the new assessment to 
address a number of issues that cut across the various sectors and systems 
covered by the WGII report, as well as across the three Working Groups of IPCC, 
such as sustainable development, equity, scientific uncertainties, costing 
methodologies, and decisionmaking frameworks. Mitigation of climate change, 
treated in previous WGII reports, is now the subject of WGIII's contribution to 
the TAR. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Research on climate impacts has grown considerably since the SAR, and much 
has been learned in the past 5 years regarding the potential risk of damage 
associated with projected climate change. The research has added to what we know 
about the vulnerabilities to climate change of a wide range of ecological 
systems (forests, grasslands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and marine environments) 
and human systems (agriculture, water resources, coastal resources, human 
health, financial institutions, and human settlements).<BR></P>
<P>Observational evidence of changes has accumulated in many physical and 
biological systems (e.g., glacial melting, shifts in geographic ranges of plant 
and animal species, and changes in plant and animal biology) that are highly 
consistent with warming observed in recent decades. These observations are 
adding to our knowledge of the sensitivity of affected systems to changes in 
climate and can help us to understand the vulnerability of systems to the 
greater and more rapid climate changes projected for the 21st century. A number 
of unique systems are increasingly recognized as especially vulnerable to 
climate change (e.g., glaciers, coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and 
tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie wetlands, and remnant 
native grasslands). In addition, climate change is expected to threaten some 
species with greater probability of extinction. Potential changes in the 
frequency, intensity, and persistence of climate extremes (e.g. heat waves, 
heavy precipitation, and drought) and in climate variability [e.g., El Niño 
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] are emerging as key determinants of future impacts 
and vulnerability. The many interactions of climate change with other stresses 
on the environment and human populations, as well as linkages between climate 
change and sustainable development, are increasingly emphasized in recent 
research and preliminary insights from these important efforts are reflected in 
the report.<BR></P>
<P>The value of adaptation measures to diminish the risk of damage from future 
climate change, and from present climate variability, was recognized in previous 
assessments and is confirmed and expanded upon in the new assessment. 
Understanding of the determinants of adaptive capacity has advanced and confirms 
the conclusion that developing countries, particularly the least developed 
countries, have lesser capacity to adapt than do developed countries. This 
condition contributes to relatively high vulnerability to damaging effects of 
climate change in these countries. <BR></P>
<P>The WGII report was compiled by 183 Lead Authors between July 1998 and 
February 2001. In addition, 243 Contributing Authors submitted draft text and 
information to the Lead Author teams. Drafts of the report were circulated twice 
for review, first to experts and a second time to both experts and governments. 
Comments received from 440 reviewers were carefully analyzed and assimilated to 
revise the document with guidance provided by 33 Review Editors. The revised 
report was presented for consideration at a session of the Working Group II 
panel held in Geneva from 13 to 16 February 2001, in which delegates from 100 
countries participated. There, the <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/005.htm">Summary for Policymakers</A> was 
approved in detail and the full report accepted.<BR></P>
<P>This report contains a <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/005.htm">Summary for Policymakers</A> (SPM) 
and a <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/021.htm">Technical Summary</A> 
(TS) in addition to the 19 chapters comprising the full report. Each paragraph 
of the SPM has been referenced to the supporting sections of the TS. In turn, 
each paragraph of the TS has been referenced to the appropriate section of the 
relevant chapter. The first three chapters set the stage for the report by 
discussing the context of climate change, methods for research and assessment, 
and development of scenarios. Chapters 4 through 9 assess the state of knowledge 
regarding climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability for different 
natural and human systems or sectors. <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/377.htm">Chapters 10</A> through <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/619.htm">17</A> assess vulnerabilities and 
key concerns of eight regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, 
Europe, Latin America, North America, polar regions, and small island states. <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/641.htm">Chapter 18</A> presents a 
synthesis of adaptation challenges, options, and capacity. <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/657.htm">Chapter 19</A> concludes the 
report with a synthesis of climate change risks for unique and threatened 
systems, extreme climate events, uneven distribution of impacts, global 
aggregate impacts, and large-scale high-impact events. An electronic version of 
the report that can be searched for key words will be available on the web (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">http://www.ipcc.ch/</A>) and CD-ROM.<BR></P>
<P>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to all the Coordinating Lead 
Authors, Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review Editors, and expert and 
government reviewers, without whose expertise, diligence, and patience and 
considerable investments of uncompensated time a report of this quality could 
never have been completed. We would also like to thank members of the Working 
Group II Bureau for their assistance throughout the preparation of the 
report.<BR></P>
<P>We would particularly like to thank Neil Leary, who headed the WGII Technical 
Support Unit, and his staff, Dave Dokken, Kasey Shewey White, Sandy MacCracken, 
and Florence Ormond. Their tireless and very capable efforts to coordinate the 
WGII assessment ensured a final product of high scientific quality. In addition 
we thank Richard Moss for his invaluable contributions to the early planning 
phase of this work.</P>
<P>We would also like to thank Narasimhan Sundararaman, the Secretary of IPCC; 
Renate Christ, Deputy Secretary; and the staff of the IPCC Secretariat, Rudie 
Bourgeois, Chantal Ettori and Annie Courtin who provided logistical support for 
government liaison and travel of experts from the developing and transitional 
economy countries.<BR></P>
