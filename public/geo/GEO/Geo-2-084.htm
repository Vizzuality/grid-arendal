<CENTER></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Times>Invading non-indigenous species in the United States cause 
major environmental damages and losses adding up to more than $138 billion per 
year. There are approximately 50,000 foreign species and the number is 
increasing. About 42% of the species on the Threatened or Endangered species 
lists are at risk primarily because of non-indigenous species. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In the history of the United States, approximately 50,000 
non-indigenous (non-native) species are estimated to have been introduced into 
the United States. Introduced species, such as corn, wheat, rice, and other food 
crops, and cattle, poultry, and other livestock, now provide more than 98% of 
the U.S. food system at a value of approximately $800 billion per year (USBC 
1998). Other exotic species have been introduced for landscape restoration, 
biological pest control, sport, pets, and food processing. Some non-indigenous 
species, however, have caused major economic losses in agriculture, forestry, 
and several other segments of the U.S. economy, in addition to harming the 
environment. One recent study reported approximately $97 billion in damages from 
79 exotic species during the period from 1906 to 1991 (OTA 1993). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Estimating the full extent of the environmental damages 
caused by exotic species and the number of species extinctions they have caused 
is difficult because little is known about the estimated 750,000 species in the 
United States, half of which have not even been described (Raven and Johnson 
1992). Nonetheless, about 400 of the 958 species that are listed as threatened 
or endangered under the Endangered Species Act are considered to be at risk 
primarily because of competition with and predation by non-indigenous species 
(Nature Conservancy 1996; Wilcove et al. 1998). In other regions of the world, 
as many as 80% of the endangered species are threatened due to the pressures of 
non-native species (Armstrong 1995). Many other species worldwide that are not 
listed are also negatively affected by alien species and/or ecosystem changes 
caused by alien species. Estimating the economic impacts associated with 
non-indigenous species in the United States is also difficult; nevertheless, 
enough data are available to quantify some of the impacts on agriculture, 
forestry, and public health. In this article, we assess as much as possible the 
magnitude of the environmental impacts and economic costs associated with the 
diverse non-indigenous species that have become established within the United 
States. Although species translocated within the United States can also have 
significant impacts, this assessment is limited to non-indigenous species that 
did not originate within the United States or its territories.</FONT>

<CENTER>ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES AND ASSOCIATED CONTROL COSTS</CENTER></H3>
<P><FONT face=Times>Most plant and vertebrate animal introductions have been 
intentional, whereas most invertebrate animal and microbe introductions have 
been accidental. In the past 40 years, the rate of and risks associated with 
biotic invaders have increased enormously because of human population growth, 
rapid movement of people, and alteration of the environment. In addition, more 
goods and materials are being traded among nations than ever before, thereby 
creating opportunities for unintentional introductions (Bryan 1996; USBC 
1998).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Some of the approximately 50,000 species of plants and 
animals that have invaded the United States cause many different types of damage 
to managed and natural ecosystems (Table 1). Some of these damages and control 
costs are assessed below. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Plants.</B> Most alien plants now established in the 
United States were introduced for food, fiber, or ornamental purposes. An 
estimated 5000 introduced plant species have escaped and now exist in U.S. 
natural ecosystems (Morse et al. 1995), compared with a total of about 17,000 
species of native U.S. plants (Morin 1995). In Florida, of the approximately 
25,000 alien plant species imported mainly as ornamentals for cultivation, more 
than 900 have escaped and become established in surrounding natural ecosystems 
(Frank and McCoy 1995a; Frank et al. 1997; Simberloff et al. 1997). More than 
3000 plant species have been introduced into California, and many of these have 
escaped into the natural ecosystem (Dowell and Krass 1992). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Some of the 5000 non-indigenous plants established in U.S. 
natural ecosystems have displaced several native plant species (Morse et al. 
1995). Non-indigenous weeds are spreading and invading approximately 700,000 
ha/yr of the U.S. wildlife habitat (Babbitt 1998). One of these pest weeds is 
the European purple loosestrife (<I>Lythrum salicaria</I>), which was introduced 
in the early 19th century as an ornamental plant (Malecki et al. 1993). It has 
been spreading at a rate of 115,000 ha/yr and is changing the basic structure of 
most of the wetlands it has invaded (Thompson et al. 1987). Competitive stands 
of purple loosestrife have reduced the biomass of 44 native plants and 
endangered wildlife, including the bog turtle (<I>Clemmys muhlenbengil</I>) and 
several duck species, that depend on these native plants (Gaudet and Keddy 
1988). Loosestrife now occurs in 48 states and costs $45 million per year in 
control costs and forage losses (ATTRA 1997).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Many introduced plant species established in the wild are 
having an effect on U.S. parks (Hiebert and Stubbendieck 1993). In Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park, 400 of approximately 1,500 vascular plant species are 
exotic, and 10 of these are currently displacing and threatening other species 
in the park (Hiebert and Stubbendieck 1993). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>The problem of introduced plants is especially significant 
in Hawaii. Hawaii has a total of 2690 plant species, 946 of which are 
non-indigenous species (Eldredge and Miller 1997). About 800 native species are 
currently endangered (Vitousek 1988).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Sometimes one non-indigenous plant species competitively 
overruns an entire ecosystem. For example, in California, yellow star thistle 
(<I>Centaurea solstitalis</I>) now dominates more that 4 million ha of northern 
California grassland, resulting in the total loss of this once productive 
grassland (Campbell 1994). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Similarly, European cheatgrass (<I>Bromus tectorum</I>) is 
dramatically changing the vegetation and fauna of many natural ecosystems. This 
annual grass has invaded and spread throughout the shrub-steppe habitat of the 
Great Basin in Idaho and Utah, predisposing the invaded habitat to fires 
(Kurdila 1995; Vitousek et al. 1996; Vitousek et al. 1997). Before the invasion 
of cheatgrass, fire burned once every 60 - 110 years, and shrubs had a chance to 
become well established. Now, fires occur about every 3 - 5 years; shrubs and 
other vegetation are diminished, and competitive monocultures of cheatgrass now 
exist on 5 million ha in Idaho and Utah (Whisenant 1990). The animals dependent 
on the shrubs and other original vegetation have been reduced or eliminated. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>An estimated 138 non-indigenous tree and shrub species have 
invaded native U.S. forest and shrub ecosystems (Campbell 1998). Introduced 
trees include salt cedar (<I>Tamarix pendantra</I>), eucalyptus (<I>Eucalyptus 
spp.</I>), Brazilian pepper (<I>Schinus terebinthifolius</I>), and Australian 
melaleuca (<I>Melaleuca quenquenervia</I>) (OTA 1993; Miller 1995; Randall 
1996). Some of these trees have displaced native trees, shrubs, and other 
vegetation types, and populations of some associated native animal species have 
been reduced in turn (OTA 1993). For example, the melaleuca tree is 
competitively spreading at a rate of 11,000 ha/yr throughout the vast forest and 
grassland ecosystems of the Florida Everglades (Campbell 1994), where it damages 
the natural vegetation and wildlife (OTA 1993).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Exotic aquatic weeds are also a significant problem in the 
United States. For example, in the Hudson River basin of New York, there are 53 
exotic aquatic weed species (Mills et al. 1997). In Florida, exotic aquatic 
plants, such as hydrilla (<I>Hydrilla verticillata</I>), water <I>hyacinth 
(Eichhornia crassipes</I>), and water lettuce (<I>Pistia straiotes</I>), are 
altering fish and other aquatic animal species, choking waterways, altering 
nutrient cycles, and reducing recreational use of rivers and lakes. Active 
control measures of the aquatic weeds have become necessary (OTA 1993). For 
instance, Florida spends about $14.5 million each year on hydrilla control 
(Center et al. 1997). Nevertheless, hydrilla infestations in just 2 Florida 
lakes have caused an estimated $10 million in recreational losses in the lakes 
annually (Center et al. 1997). In the United States as a whole, a total of $100 
million is invested annually in non-indigenous species aquatic weed control (OTA 
1993).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Mammals.</B> About 20 species of mammals have been 
introduced into the United States; these include dogs, cats, horses, burros, 
cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and deer (Layne 1997). Several of these species have 
escaped or were released into the wild; many have become pests by preying on 
native animals, grazing on vegetation, or intensifying soil erosion. For 
example, goats (<I>Capra hirus</I>) introduced on San Clemente Island, 
California, are responsible for the extinction of 8 endemic plant species as 
well as the endangerment of 8 other native plant species (Kurdila 1995). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Many small mammals have also been introduced into the United 
States. These species include a number of rodents, (the European [black or tree] 
rat [<I>Rattus rattus</I>)], Asiatic [Norway or brown] rat [<I>Rattus 
norvegicus</I>], house mouse [<I>Mus musculus</I>], and European rabbit 
<I>[Oryctolagus cuniculus</I>] (Layne 1997). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Some introduced rodents have become serious pests on farms, 
in industries, and in homes (Layne 1997). Rats and mice are particularly 
abundant and destructive on farms. On poultry farms, there is approximately 1 
rat per 5 chickens (D. Pimentel, unpublished, 1951; Smith 1984). Using this 
ratio, the total rat population on U. S. poultry farms may easily number more 
than 1.4 billion (USDA 1998). Assuming that the number of rats per chicken has 
declined because of improved rat control since these observations were made, we 
estimate that the number of rats on poultry and other farms is approximately 1 
billion. With an estimated additional 1 rat per person in homes and related 
areas (Wachtel and McNeely 1985), there are an estimated 250 million rats in the 
United States (USBC 1998). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>If we assume, conservatively, that each adult rat consumes 
and/or destroys stored grains (Chopra 1992; Ahmed et al. 1995) and other 
materials valued at $15/yr, then the total cost of destruction by introduced 
rats in the United States is more than $19 billion per year. In addition, rats 
cause fires by gnawing electric wires, pollute foodstuffs, and act as vectors of 
several diseases, including salmonellosis and leptospirosis, and, to a lesser 
degree, plague and murine typhus (Richards 1989). They also prey on some native 
invertebrate and vertebrate species like birds and bird eggs (Amarasekare 1993). 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>One of the first cases of the failure of biological control 
is the use of the Indian mongoose (<I>Herpestes auropunctatus</I>). It was first 
introduced into Jamaica in 1872 for biological control of rats in sugarcane 
(Pimentel 1955). It was subsequently introduced to the territory of Puerto Rico, 
other West Indian Islands, and Hawaii for the same purpose. The mongoose 
controlled the Asiatic rat but not the European rat, and it preyed heavily on 
native ground nesting birds (Pimentel 1955; Vilella and Zwank 1993). It also 
preyed on beneficial native amphibians and reptiles, causing at least 7 
amphibian and reptile extinctions in Puerto Rico and other islands of the West 
Indies (Henderson 1992). In addition, the mongoose emerged as the major vector 
and reservoir of rabies and leptospirosis in Puerto Rico and other islands 
(Everard and Everard 1992). Based on public health damages, killing of poultry 
in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, extinctions of amphibians and reptiles, and 
destruction of native birds, we estimate that the mongoose is causing 
approximately $50 million in damages each year in Puerto Rico and the Hawaiian 
Islands. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Introduced cats have also become a serious threat to some 
native birds and other animals. There are an estimated 63 million pet cats in 
the United States (Nassar and Mosier 1991), plus as many as 30 million feral 
cats (Luoma 1997). Cats prey on native birds (Fitzgerald 1990), plus small 
native mammals, amphibians, and reptiles (Dunn and Tessaglia 1994). Estimates 
are that feral cats in Wisconsin and Virginia kill more than 3 million birds in 
each state per year (Luoma 1997). Based on the Wisconsin and Virginia data, we 
assume that 5 birds are killed per feral cat/year; McKay (1996) reports that pet 
cats kill a similar number of birds as feral cats. Thus, about 465 million birds 
are killed by cats per year in the nation. Each adult bird can be valued at $30. 
This cost per bird is based on the literature that reports that a bird watcher 
spends $0.40 per bird observed, a hunter spends $216 per bird shot, and 
specialists spend $800 per bird reared for release; in addition, note that EPA 
fines polluters $10 per fish killed, including small, immature fish (Pimentel 
and Greiner 1997). Therefore, the total damage to U.S. bird population is 
approximately $14 billion/yr. This figure does not include small mammals, 
amphibians, and reptiles that are killed by feral and pet cats (Dunn and 
Tessaglia 1994).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Like cats, most dogs introduced into the United States were 
introduced for domestic purposes, but some have escaped into the wild. Many of 
these wild dogs run in packs and kill deer, rabbits, and domestic cattle, sheep, 
and goats. Carter (1990) reported that feral dog packs in Texas cause more than 
$5 million in livestock losses each year. Dog packs have also become a serious 
problem in Florida (Layne 1997). In addition to the damages caused by dogs in 
Texas, and conservatively assuming $5 million for all damages for the other 49 
states combined, total losses in livestock kills by dogs per year would be 
approximately $10 million per year. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Moreover, an estimated 4.7 million people are bitten by 
feral and pet dogs annually, with 800,000 cases requiring medical treatment 
(Sacks et al. 1996). Centers for Disease Control estimates medical treatment for 
dog bites costs $165 million/yr, and the indirect costs, such as lost work, 
increase the total costs of dog bites to $250 million/yr (Colburn 1999; Quinlan 
and Sacks, 1999). In addition, dog attacks cause between 11 and 14 deaths per 
year, and 80% of the victims are small children (CDC 1997).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Birds.</B> Approximately 97 of the 1,000 bird species in 
the United States are exotic (Temple 1992). Of the approximately 97 introduced 
bird species, only 5%, including chickens, are considered beneficial. Most 
(56%), though, are considered pests (Temple 1992). Pest species include the 
pigeon, which was introduced into the United States for agricultural purposes. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Introduced bird species are an expecially severe problem in 
Hawaii. A total of 35 of the 69 non-indigenous bird species introduced between 
1850 and 1984 in Hawaii are still extant on the islands (Moulton and Pimm 1983; 
Pimm 1991). One such species, the common myna (<I>Acridotheres tristis</I>), was 
introduced to help control pest cutworms and armyworms in sugarcane (Kurdila 
1995). However, it became the major disperser of seeds of an introduced serious 
weed, <I>Lantana camara</I>. In the continental United States, the English or 
house sparrow (<I>Passer domesticus</I>) was introduced in 1853 to control the 
canker worm (Laycock 1966; Roots 1976). By 1900, the had become pests because 
they damage plants around homes and public buildings and consume wheat, corn, 
and the buds of fruit trees (Laycock 1966). Furthermore, English sparrows harass 
native birds, including robins, Baltimore orioles, yellow-billed cuckoos, and 
black-billed cuckoos, and displace native bluebirds, wrens, purple martins, and 
cliff swallows from their nesting sites (Laycock 1966; Roots 1976; Long 1981). 
They are also associated with the spread of about 29 human and livestock 
diseases (Weber 1979).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>The single-most serious pest bird in the United States is 
the exotic common pigeon (<I>Columba livia</I>) that exists in most cities of 
the world, including those in the United States (Robbins 1995). Pigeons are 
considered a nuisance because they foul buildings, statues, cars, and sometimes 
people, and feed on grain (Long 1981; Smith, 1992). The control costs of pigeons 
are at least $9 per pigeon per year (Haag-Wackernagel 1995). Assuming 1 pigeon 
per ha in urban areas (Johnston and Janiga 1995) or approximately 0.5 pigeons 
per person, and using potential control costs as a surrogate for losses, pigeons 
cause an estimated $1.1 billion/yr in damages. These control costs do not 
include the environmental damages associated with pigeons, which serve as 
reservoirs and vectors for over 50 human and livestock diseases, including 
parrot fever, ornithosis, histoplasmosis, and encephalitis (Weber 1979; Long 
1981).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Amphibians and Reptiles.</B> Amphibians and reptiles 
introduced into the United States number about 53 species. All these 
non-indigenous species occur in relatively warm states -- Florida is now host to 
30 species and Hawaii to 12 (McCoid and Kleberg 1995; Lafferty and Page 1997). 
The negative ecological impacts of several of these exotic species have been 
enormous . </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>The brown tree snake (<I>Boiga irregularis</I>) was 
accidentally introduced to the snake-free U.S. territory of Guam immediately 
after World War II, when military equipment was moved onto Guam (Fritts and 
Rodda 1995). Soon the snake population reached densities of 100 per ha, and 
dramatically reduced native bird, mammal, and lizard populations. Of the 13 
species of native forest birds originally found on Guam, only 3 still exist 
(Rodda et al. 1997); of the 12 native species of lizards, only 3 have survived 
(Rodda et al.1997). The snake eats chickens, eggs, and caged birds, causing 
major problems to small farmers and pet owners. It also crawls up trees and 
utility poles and has caused power outages on the island. One island-wide power 
outage caused by the snake cost the power utility more than $250,000 (Teodosio 
1987). Local outages that affect businesses are estimated to cost from $2,000 to 
$10,000 per commercial customer (Coulehan 1987). With about 86 outages per year 
(BTSCP 1996), our estimate of the cost of snake-related power outages is 
conservatively $1 million/yr. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In addition, the brown tree snake is slightly venomous, and 
has caused public health problems, especially when it has bitten children. At 
one hospital emergency room, about 26 people per year are treated for snake 
bites (OTA 1993). Some bitten infants require hospitalization and intensive 
care, at an estimated total cost of $25,000 per year. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>The total costs of endangered species recovery efforts, 
environmental planning related to snake containment on Guam and other programs 
directly stemming from the snake's invasion of Guam reach more than $1 million 
per year; in addition, up to $2 million per year is invested in research to 
control this serious pest. The brown tree snake has also invaded Hawaii but thus 
far has been exterminated. Hawaii's concern about the snake, though, has 
prompted the federal government to invest $1.6 million per year in brown tree 
snake control (Holt 1997-1998). The total cost associated with the snake is 
therefore more than $5.6 million/yr.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Fish.</B> A total of 138 non-indigenous fish species has 
been introduced into the United States (Courtenay et al. 1991; Courtenay 1993, 
1997). Most of these introduced fish have been established in states with mild 
climates, such as Florida (50 species) (Courtenay 1997) and California (56 
species) (Dill and Cordone 1997). In Hawaii, 33 non-indigenous freshwater fish 
species have become established (Maciolek 1984). Forty-four native species of 
fish are threatened or endangered in the United States by non-indigenous fish 
species (Wilcove and Bean 1994). An additional 27 native fish species are also 
negatively affected by introductions (Wilcove and Bean 1994). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Introduced fish species frequently alter the ecology of 
aquatic ecosystems. For instance, the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) 
reduces natural aquatic vegetation, while the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) 
reduces water quality by increasing turbidity. These changes have caused the 
extinctions of some native fish species (Taylor et al. 1984). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Although some native fish species are reduced in numbers, 
are driven to extinction, or hybridized by non-indigenous fish species, alien 
fish do provide some economic benefits in the improvement of sport fishing. 
Sport fishing contributes $69 billion to the economy of the United States 
(Bjergo et al. 1995; USBC 1998). However, even taking into account these 
economic benefits, based on the more than 40 non-indigenous species that have 
negatively affected native fishes and other aquatic biota, a conservative 
estimate puts the economic losses due to exotic fish at more than $1 billion 
annually.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Arthropods and Annelids.</B> Approximately 4,500 
arthropod species (2,582 species in Hawaii and more than 2,000 in the 
continental United States) have been introduced to the United States. Also, 11 
earthworm species (Hendrix 1995), and nearly 100 aquatic invertebrate species 
have been introduced (OTA 1993). About 95% of these introductions were 
accidental, with many species gaining entrance via plants or through soil and 
water ballast from ships.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>For example, the accidentally-introduced balsam woolly 
adelgid (<I>Adelges piceae</I>) inflicts severe damage in balsam-fir natural 
forest ecosystems (Jenkins 1998). According to Alsop and Laughlin (1991), this 
aphid is destroying the old-growth spruce-fir forest in many regions. Over the 
last two decades, it has spread throughout the southern Appalachians, where it 
has destroyed up to 95% of the fraser firs. Alsop and Laughlin (1991) report the 
loss of 2 native bird species and the invasion by 3 other bird species as a 
result of adelgid-mediated forest death. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Other introduced insect species have become pests of 
livestock and wildlife. For example, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis 
invicta) kills poultry chicks, lizards, snakes, and ground nesting birds (Vinson 
1994). A 34% decrease in swallow nesting success as well as a decline in the 
northern bobwhite quail populations was reported due to these ants (Allen et al. 
1995). The estimated damage to livestock, wildlife, and public health caused by 
fire ants in Texas is estimated to be $300 million/yr. An additional $200 
million is invested in control per year (Vinson 1992; TAES 1998). Assuming 
similar damages in other infested southern states -- such as Florida, Georgia, 
and Louisiana -- the fire ant damages total more than $1 billion/yr. Southern 
states are also affected by another insect, the Formosan termite (<I>Coptotermes 
formosanus</I>), which is reported to cause structural damages totalling 
approximately $1 billion/yr in Southern United States, especially in the New 
Orleans region (Corn et al. 1999). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>The European green crab (<I>Carcinus maenas</I>) has been 
associated with the demise of the soft shell clam industry in New England and 
maritime provinces of Canada (Lafferty and Kuris 1996). It also destroys 
commercial shellfish beds and preys on large numbers of native oysters and crabs 
(Lafferty and Kuris 1996), with an annual estimated economic impact of $44 
million/yr (Lafferty and Kuris 1996).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Mollusks.</B> Eighty-eight species of mollusks have been 
both intentionally and accidentally introduced and established in U. S. aquatic 
ecosystems (OTA 1993). Two have become serious pests: the zebra mussel 
(<I>Dreissena polymorpha</I>) and the Asian clam (<I>Corbicula fluminea</I>). 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>The zebra mussel was first found in Lake St. Clair after 
gaining entrance via ballast water released in the Great Lakes from ships that 
had traveled from Europe (Benson and Boydstun 1995). It has spread into most of 
the aquatic ecosystems in the eastern United States and is expected to invade 
most freshwater habitats throughout the nation in approximately 20 years (Benson 
and Boydstun 1995). Large mussel populations reduce food and oxygen for native 
fauna. In addition, zebra mussels have been observed completely covering native 
mussels, clams, and snails, thereby further threatening their survival (Benson 
and Boydstun 1995; Keniry and Marsden 1995). Mussel densities have reached 
700,000/m</FONT><FONT face=Times size=1>2</FONT><FONT face=Times> in some 
locations (Griffiths et al. 1991). Zebra mussels also invade and clog water 
intake pipes and water filtration and electric generating plants; it is 
estimated that they will cause $5 billion/yr in damages to these facilities and 
associated control costs by the year 2000 (Khalanski 1997). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Although the Asian clam grows and disperses less rapidly 
than the zebra mussel, it too is causing significant fouling problems and is 
threatening native species. Costs associated with its fouling damage are about 
$1 billion/yr (Isom 1986; OTA 1993).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Another pest mollusk is the introduced shipworm (<I>Teredo 
navalis</I>), which was first introduced into the San Francisco Bay. It has 
caused serious damage since the early 1990s. Currently, damages are estimated to 
be approximately $200 million/yr (Cohen and Carlton 1995).</FONT> 
<H3>
<CENTER>CROP, PASTURE, AND FOREST LOSSES AND ASSOCIATED CONTROL 
COSTS</CENTER></H3>
<P><FONT face=Times>Many weeds, pest insects, and plant pathogens are biological 
invaders. These non-indigenous species cause several billion dollars worth of 
losses to crops, pastures, and forests annually in the United States. In 
addition, several billion dollars are spent on pest control. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Weeds.</B> In crop systems, including forage crops, an 
estimated 500 introduced plant species have become weed pests; some of these, 
such as Johnson grass (<I>Sorghum halepense</I>) and Kudzu (<I>Pueraria 
lobata</I>), were actually introduced as crops and then became pests (Pimentel 
et al. 1989). Most of these weeds were accidentally introduced with crop seeds, 
from ship-ballast soil, or from various imported plant materials, among which 
were yellow rocket (<I>Barbarea vulgaris</I>) and Canada thistle (<I>Cirsium 
arvense</I>).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>In U.S. agriculture, weeds cause an overall reduction of 12% 
in crop yields. In economic terms, this reduction represents about $33 billion 
in lost crop production annually, based on the crop potential value of all U.S. 
crops of more than $267 billion/yr (USBC 1998). Based on the survey that about 
73% of the weed species are non-indigenous (Pimentel 1993), it follows that 
about $24 billion/yr of these crop losses are due to introduced weeds. However, 
non-indigenous weeds are often more serious pests than native weeds; this 
estimate of $24 billion/yr is conservative. In addition to direct losses, 
approximately $4 billion/yr in herbicides are applied to U.S. crops (Pimentel 
1997), of which about $3 billion/yr is used for control of non-indigenous weeds. 
Therefore, the total costs of introduced weeds to the U.S. economy is about $27 
billion annually. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In pastures, 45% of weeds are non-indigenous species 
(Pimentel 1993). U.S. pastures provide about $10 billion in forage crops 
annually (USDA 1998), and the estimated losses due to weeds are approximately $2 
billion (Pimentel 1991). Forage losses due to non-indigenous weeds are nearly $1 
billion/yr. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Some introduced weeds are toxic to cattle and wild 
ungulates, such as leafy spurge (<I>Euphoria esula</I>) (Trammel and Butler 
1995). In addition, several non-indigenous thistles have reduced native forage 
plant species in pastures, rangelands, and forests, thus reducing cattle grazing 
(Dewey 1991). According to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (1998), ranchers 
spend about $5 billion each year to control invasive non-indigenous weeds in 
pastures and rangelands. Nevertheless, these weeds continue to spread.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Control of weed species in lawns, gardens, and golf courses 
is a significant proportion of the total management costs of about $36 
billion/yr (USBC 1998). In fact, Templeton et al. (1998) estimated that each 
year about $1.3 billion of the $36 billion is spent just on residential weed, 
insect, and disease pest control each year. Because a large proportion of these 
weeds, such as dandelions (<I>Taraxacum officinale</I>) are exotics, we estimate 
that $500 million is spent on residential exotic weed control and an additional 
$1 billion is invested in non-indigenous weed control on golf courses. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Weed trees also have an economic impact, and from $3 to $6 
million per year is being spent in efforts to control only the melaleuca tree in 
Florida.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Vertebrate Pests.</B> Horses (<I>Equus caballus</I>) and 
burros (<I>Equus asinus</I>), deliberately released in the western United 
States, have attained wild populations of approximately 50,000 animals (Pogacnik 
1995). These animals graze heavily on native vegetation, allowing non-indigenous 
annuals to displace native perennials (Rosentreter 1994). Burros inhabiting the 
northwestern United States also diminish the primary food sources of native 
bighorn sheep and seed-eating birds, thereby reducing the abundance of these 
native animals (Kurdila 1995). In general, the large populations of introduced 
wild horses and burros cost the nation an estimated $5 million/yr in forage 
losses (Pimentel et al. 1999).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Feral pigs (<I>Sus scrofa</I>), native to Eurasia and North 
Africa, have been introduced into some U.S. parks for hunting, including parks 
in the California coastal prairie and Hawaiian islands, where they have 
substantially changed the vegetation in these parks (Kotanen 1995). In Hawaii, 
more than 80% of the soil is bare in regions inhabited by pigs (Kurdila 1995). 
This disturbance allows annual plants to invade the overturned soil and 
intensifies soil erosion. Pig control per park in Hawaii (~1500 pigs/park) 
(Stone et al. 1992) costs about $150,000/yr . Assuming that the 3 parks in 
Hawaii have similar pig control problems, the total is $450,000/yr (P. C., R. 
Zuniga, Cornell University, 1999). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Feral pigs have also become a serious problem in Florida, 
where their population has risen to more than 500,000 (Layne 1997); similarly, 
in Texas their number ranges from 1 to 1.5 million. In Florida, Texas, and 
elsewhere, pigs damage grain, peanut, soybean, cotton, hay, and various 
vegetable crops, and the environment (Rollins 1998). Pigs also transmit and are 
reservoirs for serious human and livestock diseases, including brucellosis, 
pseudobrucellosis, and trichinosis (Davis 1998). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Nationwide, there are an estimated 4 million feral pigs. 
Based on environmental and crop damages of about $200 per pig annually (one pig 
can cause up to $1000 of damages to crops in one night), and assuming that 4 
million feral pigs inhabit the United States, the yearly damage amounts to about 
$800 million/yr. This estimate is conservative because pigs cause significant 
environmental damages and diseases that cannot be easily translated into dollar 
values.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Other animals that threaten crop production include birds. 
European starlings<I> (Sturnus vulgaris</I>) are serious pests and are estimated 
to occur at densities of more than 1 per ha in agricultural regions (Moore 
1980). Starlings are capable of destroying as much as $2,000 worth of cherries 
per hectare (Feare 1980). In grain fields, starlings consume about $6/ha of 
grain (Feare 1980). Conservatively assuming $5/ha for all damages to many crops 
in the United States, the total loss due to starlings would be approximately 
$800 million/yr. In addition, these aggressive birds have displaced numerous 
native birds (Laycock 1966). Starlings have also been implicated in the 
transmission of 25 diseases, including parrot fever and other diseases of humans 
(Laycock 1966; Weber 1979).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Insect and Mite Pests.</B> Approximately 500 
non-indigenous insect and mite species are pests in crops in the United States. 
Hawaii has 5,246 identified native insect species, and an additional 2,582 
introduced insect species (Howarth 1990; Frank and McCoy 1995a; Eldredge and 
Miller 1997). Introduced insects account for 98% of the crop pest insects in the 
state (Beardsley 1991). In addition to Florida's 11,500 native insect species, 
949 introduced species have, mostly accidentally, invaded the state (42 species 
were intentionally introduced for biological control; Frank and McCoy 1995b). In 
California, the 600 introduced species are responsible for 67% of all crop 
losses (Dowell and Krass 1992). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Each year, pest insects destroy about 13% of potential crop 
production representing a value of about $33 billion in U.S. crops (USBC 1998). 
Considering that about 40% of the pests were introduced (Pimentel 1993), we 
estimate that introduced pests cause about $13 billion in crop losses each year. 
In addition, about $1.2 billion in pesticides are applied for all insect control 
each year (Pimentel 1997). The portion applied against introduced pest insects 
is approximately $500 million/yr. Therefore, the total cost for introduced 
non-indigenous insect pests is approximately $13.5 billion/yr. In addition, 
based on the analysis of management costs of lawns, gardens, and golf courses, 
we estimate the control costs of pest insects and mites in lawns, gardens, and 
golf courses to be at least $1.5 billion/yr.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>In addition to crops, about 360 non-indigenous insect 
species have become established in American forests (Liebold et al. 1995), of 
which approximately 30% of these are now serious pests. Insects cause the loss 
of approximately 9% of forest products, amounting to a cost of $7 billion per 
year (Hall and Moody 1994; USBC 1998). Because 30% of the pests are 
non-indigenous, annual losses attributed to non-indigenous species is about $2.1 
billion per year.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>The gypsy moth (<I>Lymantria dispar</I>), intentionally 
introduced into Massachusetts in the 1800s for possible silk production, has 
developed into a major pest of U.S. forest and ornamental trees, especially oaks 
(Campbell and Schlarbaum 1994). The U.S. Forest Service currently spends about 
$11 million annually on gypsy moth control (Campbell and Schlarbaum 
1994).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times><B>Plant Pathogens.</B> There are an estimated 50,000 
parasitic and non-parasite diseases of plants in the United States, most of 
which are caused by fungae species (USDA 1960). In addition more than 1300 
species of viruses are plant pests in the United States (USDA 1960). Many of 
these microbes are non-native and were introduced inadvertently with seeds and 
other parts of host plants and have become major crop pests in the United States 
(Pimentel 1993). Including the introduced plant pathogens plus other soil 
microbes, we estimate conservatively that more than 20,000 species of microbes 
have invaded the United States. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>U.S. crop losses to all plant pathogens total approximately 
$33 billion per year (Pimentel 1997; USBC 1998). Approximately 65% (Pimentel 
1993), or an estimated $21 billion per year of losses are attributable to 
non-indigenous plant pathogens. In addition, $0.72 billion is spent in total 
annually for fungicides (Pimentel 1997), with approximately $0.5 billion/yr for 
only the control of non-indigenous plant pathogen. This brings the costs of 
damage and control of non-indigenous plant pathogens to about $21.5 billion/yr. 
In addition, based on the earlier discussion of pests in lawns, gardens, and 
golf courses, we estimate the control costs of plant pathogens in lawns, 
gardens, and golf courses to be at least $2 billion/yr.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>In forests, more than 20 non-indigenous species of plant 
pathogens attack woody plants (Liebold et al. 1995). Two of the most serious 
plant pathogens are the chestnut blight fungus (<I>Cryphonectria parasitica</I>) 
and Dutch elm disease (<I>Ophiostoma ulmi</I>). Before the accidental 
introduction of chestnut blight, approximately 25% of eastern U.S. deciduous 
forest consisted of American chestnut trees (Campbell 1994). Now chestnut trees 
have all but disappeared. Removal of elm trees devastated by <I>O. ulmi</I> 
costs about $100 million/yr (Campbell and Schlarbaum 1994). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In addition, plant pathogens of forest plants cause the loss 
of approximately 9%, or $7 billion, of forest products each year (Hall and Moody 
1994; USBC 1998). The proportion of introduced plant pathogens in forests is 
similar to that of introduced insects (about 30%), thus, approximately $2.1 
billion in forest products are lost each year to non-indigenous plant pathogens 
in the United States.</FONT> 
<H3>
<CENTER>LIVESTOCK PESTS</CENTER></H3>
<P><FONT face=Times>Similar to crops, exotic microbes (e.g., calf diarrhea 
rotavirus) and parasites (e.g., face flies, <I>Musca autumnalis</I>) were 
introduced along with livestock brought into the United States (Drummond et al., 
1981; Morgan, 1981). In addition to the hundreds of pest microbes and parasites 
that have already been introduced, more than 60 microbes and parasites could 
invade and become serious pests to U.S. livestock (USAHA 1984). A conservative 
estimate of the losses to U.S. livestock from exotic microbes and parasites was 
reported to be approximately $3 billion/yr in 1980 (Drummond et al. 1981; Morgan 
1981). Current livestock losses to pests are estimated to be approximately $9 
billion/year.</FONT> 
<H3>
<CENTER>HUMAN DISEASES</CENTER></H3>
<P><FONT face=Times>The non-indigenous diseases now having the greatest impact 
on humans are Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), syphilis, and 
influenza (Newton-John 1985; Pimentel et al. 1999). In 1993, there were 103,533 
cases of AIDS with 37,267 deaths (CDC 1996). The total U.S. health care cost for 
the treatment of AIDS averages about $6 billion per year (USPHS 1994). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>New influenza strains originating in the Far East spread 
quickly to the United States. Influenza causes 540 deaths in the United States 
each year (USBC 1998). Costs of hospitalizations for a single outbreak of 
influenza, like type A, can exceed $300 million/yr (Chapman et al., 1992). 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In addition, each year there are approximately 53,000 cases 
of syphilis in the United States; to treat only newborn children infected with 
syphilis costs $18.4 million/yr (Bateman et al. 1997). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>In total, AIDS and influenza take the lives of more than 
40,000 people each year in the United States, and treatment costs for these 
diseases total approximately $6.5 billion/yr. The costs of treating other exotic 
diseases pushes this total much higher. An increasing threat of exotic diseases 
exists because of rapid transportation, encroachment of civilization into new 
ecosystems, and growing environmental degradation.</FONT> 
<H3>
<CENTER>THE NON-INDIGENOUS SPECIES THREAT</CENTER></H3>
<P><FONT face=Times>With more than 50,000 non-indigenous species in the United 
States, the fraction that is harmful does not have to be large to inflict 
significant damage to natural and managed ecosystems and cause public health 
problems. A suite of ecological factors may cause non-indigenous species to 
become abundant and persistent. These include the lack of controlling natural 
enemies (e.g., purple loosestrife and imported fire ant); the development of new 
associations between alien parasite and host (e.g., AIDS virus in humans and 
gypsy moth in U.S. oaks); effective predators in a new ecosystem (e.g., brown 
tree snake and feral cats); artificial and/or disturbed habitats that provide 
favorable invasive ecosystems for the aliens (e.g., weeds in crop and lawn 
habitats); and invasion by some highly adaptable and successful species (e.g., 
water hyacinth and zebra mussel). </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Our study reveals that economic damages associated with 
non-indigenous species effects and their control amount to approximately $138 
billion/yr. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA 1993) reported average 
costs of $1.1 billion/yr ($97 billion over 85 years) for 79 species. The reason 
for our higher estimate is that we included more than 10 times the number of 
species in our assessment and found higher costs reported in the literature than 
OTA (1993) for some of the same species. For example, for the zebra mussel, OTA 
reported damages and control costs of slightly more that $300, 000 per year; we 
used an estimate of $5 billion/yr (Khalanski 1997).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>Although we reported total economic damages and associated 
control costs to be $138 billion/yr, precise economic costs associated with some 
of the most ecologically damaging exotic species are not available. The brown 
tree snake, for example, has been responsible for the extinction of dozens of 
bird and lizard species on Guam. Yet for this snake, only minimal cost data are 
known. In other cases, such as the zebra mussel and feral pigs, only combined 
damage and control cost data are available. The damage and control costs are 
considered low when compared with the extensive environmental damages these 
species cause. If we had been able to assign monetary values to species 
extinctions and losses in biodiversity, ecosystem services, and aesthetics, the 
costs of destructive non-indigenous species would undoubtedly be several times 
higher than $138 billion/yr. Yet even this understated economic loss indicates 
that non-indigenous species are exacting a significant toll.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>We recognize that nearly all of our crop and livestock 
species are non-indigenous and have proven essential to the viability the U.S. 
agriculture and economy. However, the fact that certain non-indigenous crops 
(e.g., corn and wheat) are vital to agriculture and the U.S. food system does 
not diminish the enormous negative impacts of other non-indigenous species (e.g, 
zebra mussel and exotic weeds).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>The true challenge lies not in determining the precise costs 
of the impacts of exotic species, but in preventing further damage to natural 
and managed ecosystems caused by non-indigenous species. Formulation of sound 
prevention policies needs to take into account the means through which 
non-indigenous species gain access to and become established in the United 
States. Since the modes of invasion vary widely, a variety of preventative 
strategies will be needed. For example, public education, sanitation, and 
effective screening and searches at airports, seaports, and other ports of entry 
will help reduce the chances for biological invaders becoming established in the 
United States. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Times>Fortunately, the problem is gaining the attention of policy 
makers. On February 2, 1999, President Clinton issued an Executive Order 
allocating $28 million to combat alien species invasions and creating an 
Interagency Invasive Species Council to produce a plan within 18 months to 
mobilize the federal government to defend again non-indigenous species 
invasions. In addition, a Federal Interagency Weed Committee has been formed to 
help combat non-indigenous plant species invasions (FIWC 1999). The objective of 
this interagency committee is education, formation of partnerships among 
concerned groups, and stimulation of research on the biological invader problem. 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt (1999) has also established an Invasive Weed Awareness 
Coalition to combat the invasion and spread of non-native plants, such as 
knapweed (<I>Centaurea spp.</I>) and St. Johnswort (<I>Hypericum 
perforatum</I>).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times>While these policies and practices may help prevent 
accidental and intentional introduction of potentially harmful exotic species, 
we have a long way to go before the resources devoted to the problem are in 
proportion to the risks. We hope that this environmental and economic assessment 
will advance the argument that investments made now to prevent future 
introductions will be returned many times over in the preservation of natural 
ecosystems, diminished losses to agriculture and forestry, and lessened threats 
to public health.</FONT>
