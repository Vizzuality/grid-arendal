<H1 class=Heading1><A name=P3_69></A><B>The status of forest resources</B></H1>
<P class="NewPara 1">Information on the status of the world's forests - their 
extent, location, type and condition - is important for efforts to improve 
forest management worldwide and for assessments of forests' ability to provide 
the goods and services demanded of them. The following discussion focuses on two 
subjects: the area and condition of forest resources worldwide, and the status 
of the information base on global forest resources, particularly concentrating 
on information on forest area and forest-based biological diversity.</P>

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN FOREST CONDITION</B></H2>
<H3 class="Heading 3"><B>Forest cover<SUP>1</SUP></B></H3>
<P class="NewPara 1">The area of the world's forests, including natural forests 
and forest plantations, was estimated to be 3&nbsp;454&nbsp;million hectares in 
1995, or about one-fourth of the land area of the Earth. About 55&nbsp;percent 
of the world's forests are located in developing countries, with the remaining 
45&nbsp;percent in developed countries (Figure 1) (see Table 2 of Annex 3 for 
country data). The world's forests are almost equally divided between 
tropical/subtropical forests and temperate/boreal forests. Only about 
3&nbsp;percent of the world's forests are forest plantations. The remaining 
97&nbsp;percent are natural or semi-natural forests.</P>

<H3 class="Heading 3"><B>Change in forest cover</B></H3>
<P class="NewPara 1">Data published in the <I>State of the World's Forests 
1997</I> (FAO, 1997d) provide a picture of the trends in forest cover over a 
15-year interval (1980-1995) and allow a comparison between the 1980-1990 and 
1990-1995 periods. Between 1980 and 1995, the extent of the world's forests 
(including both natural forests and forest plantations) decreased by some 
180&nbsp;million hectares. There was a net increase of 20&nbsp;million hectares 
in developed countries, but a net loss of 200&nbsp;million hectares in 
developing nations. The change in forest area by region between 1980 and 1995 is 
shown in Figure 2.</P>

<P align=center class=FigureNote><B>Note:</B> Data exclude the countries of the 
former Soviet Union.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">&nbsp;</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Between 1990 and 1995, there was an estimated net loss of 
56.3&nbsp;million hectares of forests worldwide. This represented a decrease of 
65.1&nbsp;million hectares in developing countries and an increase of 
8.8&nbsp;million hectares in developed countries. Although the global loss of 
forests was still very high, the figures suggest that the rate of deforestation 
might be slowing. The estimate of forest cover change in natural forests of 
developing countries (which is where most deforestation is taking place) was an 
annual loss of 13.7&nbsp;million hectares between 1990 and 1995, compared with 
15.5&nbsp;million hectares per year over the decade 1980-1990. It will be 
difficult to know if this is a trend, however, until a comparable global data 
set is available from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (see following 
discussion).</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The major causes of change in forest cover in the tropics 
appear to be expansion of subsistence agriculture in Africa and Asia and large 
economic development programmes involving resettlement, agriculture and 
infrastructure in Latin America and Asia (FAO, 1996a). The net increase in 
forest area in developed countries is largely a result of afforestation and 
reforestation, including natural regrowth on land abandoned by agriculture. This 
increase has more than compensated for the clearing of some areas of forest in 
various developed countries, mainly for urban expansion and infrastructure 
development.</P>
<H3 class="Heading 3"><B>Forest condition: fire, ice and forest pests </B></H3>
<P class="NewPara 1">The causes of forest degradation vary from place to place, 
and the magnitude and duration of the effects are often difficult to assess. The 
causes include insect pests and diseases, fire, overharvesting of industrial 
wood and fuelwood, poor harvesting practices, overgrazing, air pollution and 
extreme climatic events, such as storms. Particularly noteworthy causes of 
forest degradation in the 1997-1998 period were the dramatic wildfires that 
affected forests throughout the world, the 1998 ice storms in the United States 
and Canada and new insect pest and disease outbreaks.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Globally, 1997 and 1998 were the worst years for wildfires 
and forest fires in recent times. Although forest fires occur every year in the 
arid and semi-arid zones of the world, nearly all types of forests burned in 
1997-1998, even some tropical rain forests which had not burned in recent 
memory. Droughts associated with the El Niño weather pattern (see Box&nbsp;1) 
turned moist forests into drier habitats and increased the flammability of 
forest vegetation, thus increasing the number, frequency, size, intensity and 
duration of fires.</P>

      <P class=BoxNewPara1>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a 
      periodically occurring oceanic-atmospheric phenomenon. It consists of El 
      Niño, a "warm phase" or a large-scale warming in the equatorial Pacific 
      Ocean, and La Niña, a "cool phase" in which surface waters of the central 
      Pacific Ocean are colder than normal. These phases are closely associated 
      with changes in atmospheric conditions (Southern Oscillation). ENSO events 
      occur on average every four years and typically last 14 to 22&nbsp;months. 
      They exhibit certain characteristic rainfall and temperature anomalies. 
      The El Niño that began in March 1997 and continued until mid-1998 is 
      believed to have been one of the most severe in recorded history. It had a 
      pronounced impact on weather and climate around the globe. While some 
      parts of the world received more rain than normal, abnormally dry 
      conditions occurred across northern Australia, Indonesia and the 
      Philippines in both seasons and in southeastern Africa and northern Brazil 
      during the northern winter season, and Indian monsoon rainfall was lower 
      in the northern summer season. The record-high global temperatures in 1998 
      were also believed to be linked to El Niño. La Niña started to develop in 
      mid-1998. Climatic anomalies in 1998 which may be associated with La Niña 
      include dry conditions in parts of South America; wetter than normal 
      conditions in northern Australia and the Philippines; above-normal 
      rainfall during the southwest monsoon in India; increased hurricane 
      activity in the Caribbean and Central America; dry spells in parts of 
      Argentina and Chile; above-normal rainfall in southern Africa, with the 
      exception of Zimbabwe; and possibly drier than normal conditions in the 
      Horn of Africa.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>
<P class="NewPara 1">&nbsp;</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">In 1997, wildfires raged in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, 
Australia, Mongolia, the Russian Federation, Colombia, Peru, Kenya, Rwanda and 
other parts of Africa. By mid-1998, fires were reported in Indonesia, the 
Amazon, Mexico and Central America, the United States, western Canada, 
far-eastern Russia and parts of Europe. National disasters were declared in many 
of these places and national and international resources were mobilized to fight 
the fires. Neighbouring countries and international and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) all responded. In March 1998, the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations requested the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to 
coordinate the UN system's response to the situation arising from the outbreak 
of forest fires in Indonesia.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Few global figures are available on the extent of the 
1997-1998 fires and associated loss of life, economic damage and environmental 
impacts.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The largest areas of forests burned in Brazil and 
Indonesia. Low rainfall in much of the Amazon attributed to the El Niño weather 
pattern contributed to a prolonged fire season (beyond the usual July to early 
October period) and an unusually high number of fires. In 1997, over 
2&nbsp;million hectares of rain forest in Brazil burned (Schemo, 1998). Analysis 
of satellite data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration showed an increase of over 50&nbsp;percent in the number of fires 
from July to November 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, and an 
86&nbsp;percent increase in a 100-day period (June to early September) in 1998 
compared with the same period in 1997 (Schwartzman, 1998). Most of the fires 
occurred in Mato Grosso and Pará states.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Some Brazilian forests of particular ecological or cultural 
significance were affected. In March 1998, fires burned over 600&nbsp;000 ha of 
rain forest in Roraima, including parts of the Yanomami Indian reserve, near the 
border with Venezuela (Schemo, 1998). In late September 1998, raging fires 
destroyed a large area of Brasilia National Park - a sanctuary for rare species 
from Brazil's central savannah region - killing wildlife and smothering the 
Brazilian capital with smoke. Earlier in the month, fire in the state of Mato 
Grosso threatened to move into Xingu National Park, home to 17&nbsp;indigenous 
groups, until rains extinguished the fire.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">In Indonesia the fires of 1997-1998 burned&nbsp;millions of 
hectares in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The exact area is still unknown. One 
estimate is that about 2&nbsp;million hectares (including savannah with 
grassland) burned in 1997 alone. Several organizations have begun the lengthy 
and complex task of interpreting satellite images to determine the total area 
burned (Schweithelm, 1998). Large quantities of smoke generated by ground fires 
fed by slow burning fuels affected neighbouring countries, influencing human 
health, interfering with transportation systems and disrupting the 
multi-million-dollar tourist industry, all of which contributed significantly to 
the economic and social cost of the fires. Many underground fires continued to 
burn into mid-1998 in natural peat and coal beds, threatening new outbreaks of 
fire.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">A representative sample of forest fires elsewhere in the 
world includes the following:</P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI class="BulletList 1">Fires in Mexico and Central America burned a reported 
  1.5&nbsp;million hectares. These generated large quantities of smoke which 
  blanketed the region and spread into the United States as far as Chicago. 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">From January to June 1998, about 13&nbsp;000 fires 
  burned in Mexico alone, consuming nearly 500&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha and killing more 
  than 70 fire-fighters and local residents. 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">Between December 1997 and April 1998, more than 
  13&nbsp;000 fires burned in Nicaragua, the most in any Central American 
  country, destroying vegetation on more than 800&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha of land. The 
  Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) recorded 
  over 11&nbsp;000 fires in the month of April 1998 alone. 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">In the southeastern United States, severe fires in 
  Florida in 1998 burned a reported 200&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha of forest by May 
  (<I>The Economist</I>, 4-10 July 1998). 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">More than 150&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha of coniferous forest 
  and farmland were burned in various parts of Greece in August 1998, including 
  the black pine forest on Mount Taygetos, site of more than 160 endemic species 
  and 36 endangered species of fauna (<I>Guardian Weekly</I>, 30 July 1998). 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">In July 1998, devastating forest fires affected more 
  than 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha in far-eastern Russia. Coniferous forest burned in 
  more than 150 places around Vladivostok, Sakhalin and Kamchatka Peninsula. 
  Fires in the southwest of the Volgograd region destroyed 9&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha of 
  forest, at an estimated cost of US$6&nbsp;million (BBC World Service, 27 July 
  1998). In September, fires swept across Russia's Pacific island of Sakhalin, 
  burning over 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha by the end of the month (Reuters News 
  Service, 21&nbsp;September 1998).</LI></UL>
<P class="NewPara 1">Active media coverage of the unusually large fires in 
Indonesia, the Amazon and Mexico increased public awareness of these 
predominantly man-made environmental disasters. The smoke from the fires, which 
endangered public health and economies beyond national borders, also helped 
focus public attention on the fires and the need to deal with policy issues 
related to fire outbreaks.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The use of fire is an integral part of land management in 
both agriculture and forestry. Some forests are ecologically adapted to fire, 
and prescribed burning is an important component of forest management practices 
in some places. However, there is ample evidence that a large proportion of the 
wildfires that occur each year are caused by human intervention. A seven-year 
field study of fire in the Amazon carried out by the Woods Hole Research Center, 
United States, shows that about half of the wildfires in the region were caused 
by fires set by farmers and ranchers to clear old cattle pasture and to burn 
newly cut forest which subsequently burned out of control. The effects of 
drought in 1997-1998 were aggravated by shifting cultivation (particularly 
slash-and-burn agricultural practices), pasture management, improperly executed 
timber harvesting operations and large-scale land clearance under agricultural 
conversion schemes. A considerable number of fires that burned around the world 
in 1997-1998 (as in other times) were cases of arson. The fires of 1997-1998 
clearly highlight the need to improve planning and management of agricultural 
land use practices to reduce the risk of wildfires; to address deficiencies in 
forest management systems; and to examine policies and regulations related both 
to conversion of forest land to agriculture and to improvement of forest 
stewardship.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The fires of 1997 and 1998 have stimulated various 
international efforts related to fires. A global system of early warning to 
indicate the potential fire risk related to climatic conditions is being 
investigated by several international organizations, including the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the World Conservation Union (IUCN), UNEP and FAO. A 
national system for advance warning by radio linked to meteorological forecasts 
from satellite imagery has been successfully tried in Burkina Faso. WHO has 
produced guidelines for forest fire emergencies. Many national and international 
meetings were organized in 1998 for fire-fighting<I> </I>and health experts, 
potential donors and, perhaps more significant, policy-makers to address the 
control, effects and underlying causes of fires. UN agencies that organized fire 
meetings in 1998 include UNEP and the United Nations Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (Geneva, Switzerland, April 1998), WHO and the 
Pan-American Health Organization (Lima, Peru, August 1998) and FAO (Rome, 
October 1998, on public policies affecting forest fires).</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Apart from the fires, 1998 was notable for another type of 
disaster which severely affected forests: ice. A series of ice storms in January 
1998 resulted in extensive damage to forests in the northeastern United States 
and eastern Canada (see Box 2). An estimated 10&nbsp;million hectares of forests 
and trees were affected, extending from Ontario to Quebec and New Brunswick in 
Canada and across northern New England in the United States (Irland, 1998).</P>

      <P class=BoxNewPara1>In January 1998, in what meteorologists called a 
      "100-year event", a series of ice storms blanketed northern New England 
      and New York with up to 7.5 cm of ice. Nearly 7&nbsp;million hectares of 
      rural forests and urban trees across the states of Maine, New Hampshire, 
      Vermont and New York were affected. Some 2&nbsp;million hectares were 
      severely damaged. Hardwood species suffered most. Estimates for natural 
      resource losses exceeded US$1&nbsp;000&nbsp;million. The effects of the 
      storm remain: thousands of kilometres of forest roads and trails are 
      littered with debris; many rural landowners will lose forest income; 
      management plans may be obsolete and need costly revision; and debris 
      increases the risk of insect pest outbreaks and fire.</P>

<P class="NewPara 1">While less visible than the wildfires and ice storms within 
the last two years, recent outbreaks of insect pests and diseases in forests may 
result in substantial economic loss and environmental damage. Although insect 
pests and diseases are often integral components of forest dynamics, severe 
outbreaks can be damaging and require costly control efforts. Their incidence 
and economic impact may be highest on plantations established for the purpose of 
wood production. Some new pest outbreaks reported in the last few years are 
noted in Box 3.</P>

      outbreak of gypsy moth (<I>Lymantria dispar</I>) which is posing a risk to 
      northern European forests is believed to have been exacerbated by 
      increased temperatures and prolonged drought conditions over the last two 
      years. The outbreak, which started in 1996 and was still ongoing in

<P class="NewPara 1">Forest resources assessments generally provide information 
on forest extent and location, types, condition, wood volume, and/or biomass. 
They may be done on a subnational, national, regional or global level. Global 
assessments are done in one of two ways: using a bottom-up approach which 
harmonizes and sums national statistics, or using a top-down approach in which 
data are generated at the regional, continental or global level. National forest 
inventories are fundamental to bottom-up approaches to forest resources

      <P class=BoxNewPara1>Forest inventories and statistical systems serve as 
      the foundation of sound policies to support sustainable forest management. 
      Integrating social, economic and environmental concerns into forest-sector 
      planning requires a great deal of information on forests, across the 
      landscape and through time. Studies repeatedly come to the same 
      conclusion: much better information is needed on the quantity, quality and 
      use of forests. Despite growing demands for better information, 
      investments in even basic forest inventories are declining. Many countries 
      have not conducted a comprehensive and statistically sound forest 
      inventory since the 1970s or early 1980s. In other countries, physical 
      inventories are declining in frequency and intensity and are being 
      replaced by modelling. New methods, such as remote sensing, are expanding 
      the ability to observe large changes in land cover. Still, without 
      reasonably current forest inventories, it is increasingly difficult to 
      assess change in forest quality and function and to draw useful 
      conclusions about the sustainability of 
use.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>

Monitoring Centre (WCMC). FAO and WCMC mainly use a bottom-up approach, which 
provides the most detail at the country level. IGBP and JRC use a top-down 
method, which provides spatial information on forest cover over broad areas. The 
FAO, JRC and IGBP assessments are ongoing,<I> </I>long-term programmes.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>Currently available information.</I></B> FAO, in 
collaboration with other partners, has been conducting global forest resources 
assessments about every ten years since 1947. The latest Forest Resources 
Assessment (FRA), which was done for 1990, was carried out jointly by FAO, the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and their member countries 
(FAO, 1995).<SUP>2</SUP> FRA 1990 was divided into two parts: one for the 
industrialized countries (the temperate and boreal forests) and the other for 
developing countries (mainly tropical and subtropical, but also some temperate 
forests). ECE and FAO conducted the temperate/boreal forest resources assessment 
(TBFRA) through the use of a questionnaire. The tropical assessment was based on 
existing reliable information and a remote-sensing-based sampling design for 
study of land cover changes. The assessment for developing countries produced 
information primarily about the area of forest in 1990 and the change since 
1980, with data from different years adjusted to these reference points. This 
information is available by country and by ecofloristic zone. TBFRA includes 
data on state and change of forest area (which have not been adjusted to a given 
reference year) and gives additional information on ownership and management 
status, growing stock, annual growth and fellings. FRA 1990 is currently the 
most comprehensive source of global-, regional- and national-level information 
on forest state and change available. It does not, however, show the spatial 
distribution of forests.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Since FRA 1990, new information requirements have emerged, 
including location-specific or spatial data which support efforts in sustainable 
forest management and assessment of forests' environmental functions (e.g. 
conservation of biological diversity, mitigation of global climate change). As a 
consequence, several groups, including IGBP, JRC and WCMC, have embarked upon 
additional global assessments of forest cover and deforestation. All are 
assessing various aspects of the spatial distribution of forest cover, although 
none are as comprehensive as the FRA programme or present the same 
information.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">IGBP, an international consortium of scientific 
organizations, developed a global low-resolution satellite image-mapping 
project. The work is based on interpretation and classification of advanced 
very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery which has a 1-km 
resolution. The IGBP land cover data set and maps and a related Global Land 
Cover Characterization database are being validated. While the main objective of 
these projects is not to provide information on forest area <I>per se</I>, 
estimates of forest area may be generated from the database and biomass 
estimates may be derived from modelling.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The JRC TREES (Tropical Resources and Environment 
monitoring by Satellites) project, established in 1991, develops forest cover 
assessment techniques for the tropical belt. The project includes:</P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI class="BulletList 1">a baseline inventory of forest area (using a 
  multispectral 1-km AVHRR data set); 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">continuous monitoring which would direct attention to 
  the areas undergoing the most active land cover change (i.e. deforestation); 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">analysis of the derived information in terms of 
  spatio-temporal patterns of deforestation through the comprehensive Tropical 
  Forest Information System (TFIS).</LI></UL>
<P class="NewPara 1">A multiyear set of AVHRR data was acquired over the whole 
tropical belt during the period 1991-1994. This global assessment has been 
further calibrated using high-resolution image maps for selected sites. The main 
outputs of this effort include a global tropical forest cover base map at 1-km 
resolution (the first such forest map at this resolution) and related figures at 
the regional to national levels.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The second phase (1996-1999) of the TREES project is 
directed at developing a prototype that can regularly produce relevant and 
accurate information on the state of tropical forest ecosystems. A panel of 
international experts has identified "hot spots" where deforestation is the most 
active. JRC is developing more automatic methods of forest monitoring using a 
range of remote-sensing and other spatial data and has developed a new sampling 
scheme to measure changes using different types of high-resolution satellite 
imagery.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">TFIS organizes the data (remote-sensing or cartographic) 
and current knowledge (reports, field observations, etc.) in a systematic 
manner. Work is being done to allow an interface between TFIS and information 
systems of the European Commission and other regional and international 
organizations.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">In 1996, WCMC, in collaboration with the World Wide Fund 
for Nature (WWF), compiled a World Forest Map showing forest extent and 
protected areas with forested land. The map is the product of a global 
geographic information system (GIS) containing more detailed maps and digital 
files from the best available national and international sources, compiled 
mainly between the early 1980s and early 1990s by WCMC in collaboration with 
IUCN. WCMC used a nominal scale of 1:1&nbsp;million, adjusting input data of 
varying scales (ranging from 1:100&nbsp;000 to 1:5&nbsp;million).</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The digital information was used to estimate the area of 
each major forest type in the world under protection and to provide a baseline 
for future monitoring of forests. The spatial data have formed the basis for a 
major statistical analysis of forest protection in the world, carried out by 
WCMC in conjunction with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), 
and have been published on CD-ROM. The digital map is maintained at WCMC.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">WCMC recently produced a new set of national-level forest 
statistics derived from the land cover maps overlaid with the political 
boundaries of countries. This could provide area estimates at the national 
level.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">WCMC has also developed a GIS database showing an estimate 
of forest cover some 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;years ago for the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) and WWF. Using the data from WCMC, WRI, under its Frontier Forests 
Initiative,<SUP>3</SUP> developed another global map comparing the large tracts 
of forest lands remaining today with those existing 8&nbsp;000 years ago. The 
Frontier Forests Initiative assessed three attributes: historic forest lost, 
forest condition (the amount of the world's current forest cover remaining in 
large tracts of intact natural forest) and threats to frontier areas. The 
WRI/WCMC map may be considered a global assessment of natural forest change over 
a large time span.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">As a follow-up, WRI has launched the major Global Forest 
Watch project to monitor forest development globally. Currently WRI is working 
with some 20 NGO partners in Cameroon, Gabon, Canada and Indonesia to map 
concessions, roads and other developments. The goal is to carry out a similar 
effort in all major forested countries within the next five years.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Each of the above-mentioned efforts uses different 
definitions, sources and methods for classifying the vegetation. Their estimates 
of forest cover are thus not directly comparable. The quality of information 
from any assessment depends largely on the quality of the basic input data. The 
maps from WCMC and WRI were compiled from existing data sources, which could 
reflect land cover, land use and/or land potential. Consequently, they suffer 
from the same problems of harmonization as do most bottom-up approaches.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The Global Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC), a new effort 
of an international partnership of institutions including FAO, will build on 
previous global forest assessments using earth satellites. GOFC has a goal of 
stimulating the production of globally consistent products derived from 
satellite data, supplemented by <I>in situ</I> data, by 2002. This will be 
achieved by facilitating the provision of forestry information and satellite 
data to organizations such as FAO and UNEP, the Global Climate Observing System 
(GCOS) and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), NGOs and national 
forest ministries through partnership arrangements with space agencies.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>Information to be available through FRA 2000. 
</I></B>The FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (FRA 2000) will be the 
most comprehensive and complete assessment yet. As envisioned, FRA 2000 will 
consist of:</P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI class="BulletList 1">a common set of definitions and standards for both 
  tropical and temperate/boreal forests; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">a common set of parameters to be assessed, including 
  not only the traditional timber information, but also information, where 
  available, on non-wood forest products, naturalness, biological diversity, 
  protected areas, carbon sequestration functions, forest condition and 
  socio-economic functions; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">a remote-sensing-based "wall-to-wall" global forest 
  map keyed to forest classes used in the assessment, an ecoregion map and a 
  database at 1-km resolution; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">a global sample of satellite data to measure changes 
  in forest cover over the past 20 years.</LI></UL>
<P class="NewPara 1">As the data will be spatially registered, researchers may 
be able to measure changes in land cover over time; thus a base may be 
established for improved comparisons for beyond 2010.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">FRA 2000 will make further improvements on the 
data-gathering techniques used in 1990 and will also make use of the data and 
technologies of other organizations. FAO will use some of the imagery and GIS 
data sets of IGBP, JRC, the Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data 
Center of the United States Geological Survey and others to develop the global 
forest cover map and database for FRA 2000.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">EROS Data Center, FAO and WCMC are developing the Global 
Forest Map, which will be the first globally consistent small-scale map showing 
forest cover distribution. The map is being generated through refinement and 
modelling of IGBP's Global Land Cover Characterization database using advanced 
image processing and GIS techniques, combined with validation by national 
experts and existing reliable information.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">In the past, an update on global forest resources was 
possible only every ten years. Institutional development and communication 
technologies may eventually make it possible to have much more frequent updates 
and much better quality of data. While technological gains have improved the 
precision of the estimates and the range of information that can be collected, 
many countries still need assistance in the planning, execution and financing of 
their own national forest inventories.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">These assessment efforts will continue to provide vital 
information on the location and extent of forests at the global level. Even more 
valuable will be the information on net change in extent and condition of 
forests over time, which addresses the heart of the problem - what is happening 
to the world's forests and consequently to forests' ability to provide the range 
of goods and services demanded of them.</P>
<H3 class="Heading 3"><B>Assessments of forest-based biological 
diversity</B></H3>
<P class="NewPara 1">Natural forests are arguably the single most important 
repository of terrestrial biological diversity (diversity of ecosystems, species 
and genetic resources). Diversity is an essential factor in maintaining forest 
function. Conservation and management of biological diversity are, therefore, 
important issues in forest planning. Global, regional and national planning, 
priority-setting and decision-making related to the conservation of biological 
diversity all depend on an understanding of the distribution of species and 
ecosystems, their protection status and the threats to them, and on information 
on the status of the conservation and use of forest genetic resources.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>Species diversity.</I></B> Knowledge of the world's 
diversity of species, their distribution and status is very incomplete. Some 
groups of organisms (e.g. birds) and some parts of the world have been studied 
more than others. Furthermore, total species diversity is better understood than 
the diversity of species associated only with forests (see Table 1), as the 
latter requires an assessment of habitat occurrence or dependence. Evaluation of 
forest species diversity is meaningful only for the better-known taxonomic 
groups. Efforts to classify birds, mammals and some plant groups according to 
forest occurrence are part of FRA 2000.</P>

<P class="NewPara 1">&nbsp;</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">A detailed understanding of the distribution of species 
richness within forests requires mapping of species distributions or richness 
contours. This work has been undertaken several times on a national scale. On a 
regional scale, progress has been made in mapping total species richness in many 
groups (e.g. the Mapping African Biodiversity Patterns project of the Danish 
Centre for Tropical Biodiversity), but as yet these efforts do not incorporate 
separate analysis of forest species.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Other approaches for evaluating forest species diversity 
and/or identifying priority areas for its conservation depend on the overlay of 
different estimates of "biodiversity hot spots"<SUP>4</SUP> with forest cover 
data. Such hot spot data sets have been compiled, for example, for endemic bird 
areas (EBAs), i.e. areas containing at least two restricted-range bird species 
(those whose distribution covers less than 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;km<SUP>2</SUP>) 
(Bibby <I>et al.</I>, 1992). These have been quite accurately mapped, and in the 
absence of similar data for other taxonomic groups, the EBA data provide a 
useful measure of the importance of biological diversity for particular 
geographic areas. Other hot spot data sets include WCMC and IUCN's <I>Centres of 
plant diversity</I> (WWF/IUCN, 1994), WWF-US's <I>Global 200 
ecoregions</I><SUP>5</SUP><I> </I>and Conservation International's 
<I>Hotspots</I>.<SUP>6</SUP></P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Mapping could also be used to identify areas where 
threatened and endangered forest species are concentrated. This would require 
categorization of species according to their forest occurrence and, ideally, 
relatively detailed data on their distributions. Nonetheless, some advances 
could be gained simply from addressing presence/absence data at the national or 
provincial level.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">A country may have high forest species diversity either 
because it has a wide range of different forest types each with its own distinct 
biota (e.g. the United States) or because individual forest types are highly 
diverse in species (e.g. some lowland tropical moist forest). The former 
characteristic is generally related to the size of the country, the latter not 
necessarily so. Countries with very high forest diversity usually combine the 
two characteristics.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>Forest ecosystem diversity.</I></B> Ecosystem 
diversity in forests is important not only in its own right but also as a 
predictor of species diversity. However, assessing ecosystem diversity requires 
meaningful systems of classification of forests, and these are increasingly 
difficult to generate as the geographical scale increases. Scientists may 
develop schemes that are useful in local or national contexts for expressing 
differences between forest ecosystems, based on combinations of physiognomy, 
phenology and floristics. However, harmonizing several different schemes to 
produce overviews on a continental or global scale is a difficult task which may 
entail so much simplification as to eliminate any real utility in expressing 
ecosystem diversity.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">For example, the harmonization of forest cover data from 70 
different sources to produce the first global map of closed forest distribution, 
<I>The WWF world forest map</I> (WCMC, 1996a), resulted in a simplistic 
classification with only five classes (temperate needleleaf, temperate broadleaf 
and mixed, tropical moist, tropical dry and mangrove forests), reflecting the 
difficulty of combining the many much more detailed classification systems used 
throughout the world. A more detailed classification involving 25 classes which 
was used by WCMC and CIFOR in the production of a subsequent digital data set on 
global forest cover (Iremonger, Ravilious and Quinton, 1997) is more meaningful 
in biodiversity terms but is still very simplistic.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">Remote sensing data are potentially a powerful source of 
information on forest ecosystem distribution and diversity. However, many 
regionally focused programmes, such as TREES and Pathfinder,<SUP>7</SUP> have 
been forced to use simplified classification schemes because of the analytical 
complexity of extracting more detail from satellite data. Global 
satellite-derived land cover data are available from the EROS Data Center in 
preliminary form. This data set helps to provide a consistent global view of 
forests' location and information about their diversity according to a number of 
classification schemes ranging from the simple to the complex, based on 
phenology as well as spectral response. The greatest advance in examining forest 
ecosystem diversity on a broad geographic scale is likely to come through the 
combination of remote sensing data with ecoregional classifications as envisaged 
in FRA 2000.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>Forest genetic resources.</I></B> FAO, the 
International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and the International 
Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) are facilitating regional 
initiatives to assess the status of genetic resources of forest trees at species 
and provenance levels; to identify gaps or overlaps in protection and 
development efforts; and to elaborate action plans for the conservation, 
management, sustainable utilization and enhancement of genetic resources of 
priority species. Regional syntheses will be prepared from data provided by the 
countries.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">At the global level, FAO is developing the Global 
Information System on Forest Genetic Resources (REFORGEN) for monitoring the 
status of genetic resources of woody species at the national level (see Box 5). 
This is the only global effort that specifically targets forest genetic 
resources.</P>

<P class="NewPara 1"><B><I>A global perspective on biological diversity.</I></B> 
Assembling a global perspective on biological diversity is a slow and complex 
task. Major advances have been made in compiling global data sets on current and 
original forest cover, but a global vegetation classification is still lacking. 
Other advances at the global level have come from the identification of areas 
important for species diversity in key groups, but congruence of diversity 
patterns between groups has been addressed only at the regional level, and even 
then not thoroughly.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">The increasing volumes of data involved in the analysis and 
management of global forest biological diversity require new approaches to data 
management. National capacities to gather and manage data to generate useful 
information - both for national use and to contribute to understanding of the 
global picture - will need to be built. Recent experiences show that the 
greatest challenges are organizational, not technological. By focusing on the 
processes involved in creating environmental information, rather than 
concentrating on data, international efforts such as the Biodiversity Data 
Management Project (UNEP/WCMC, 1996) are making useful contributions.</P>
<P class="NewPara 1">In addition to information from national sources, 
international research and other efforts can make a useful contribution to 
improvement of the global biological diversity information base. Likely sources 
of such improvement in the near future include:</P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>FRA 2000, which will include a number of parameters related to biological 
  diversity; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">results from national reporting efforts within the 
  framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and national policies and 
  plans on biological diversity elaborated within the framework of the 
  convention; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">additional research aimed at examining the congruence 
  of diversity patterns among taxonomic groups, species distributions and 
  habitat requirements, the effects of different forest management practices on 
  biological diversity and biological diversity's impact on forest functions and 
  contribution to socio-economic development; 
  <LI class="BulletList 1">REFORGEN for forest genetic resources.</LI></UL>
<P class="NewPara 1">Combining these and other initiatives should produce a more 
coherent global view of biological diversity in forests. However, the crucial 
step in maintaining biological diversity in forests is the translation of this 
knowledge into improved forest management and conservation practices throughout 
the world.</P>
<P class=Note><SUP>1</SUP> The <I>State of the World's Forests 1997</I> provided 
the most recent data available on global forest cover. As no new global data set 
on forest resources will be available until the results of the Forest Resources 
Assessment 2000 study are published, a summary of the 1995 figures published in 
SOFO 1997 is provided in this section.<BR><SUP>2</SUP> A partial, interim
