<P>The International Joint Commission (IJC) identified "Remediation and 
management of sediments contaminated with persistent toxic substances" as one of 
its 1995-1997 program priorities. Initially, the IJC requested the Water Quality 
Board (WQB), with assistance from the Science Advisory Board (SAB) and Council 
of Great Lakes Research Managers (CGLRM), make an assessment of government 
activities and programs, and identify available options and technologies for 
remediation, destruction, and storage of persistent toxic substances that are 
located in contaminated sediment. Consideration should be given to methods of 
funding and public acceptance of approaches. This issue was identified as a 
major consideration in Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) and Lakewide Management 
Plans (LaMPs). The IJC requested that a draft report be prepared in the first 
year which would form the basis for a workshop in the second year. 
<P>The WQB, with representatives from the SAB and CGLRM, convened a scoping 
meeting in March 1996 to determine the breadth of the issues to be examined. 
Specifically, this scoping meeting was charged with determining whether or not 
there was a value-added role for the WQB and IJC in moving forward on the 
contaminated sediment issue and, if so, scoping out the nature of that 
contribution, the deliverables, the need for a workshop or working meetings, 
etc. 
<P>As a result of the March 1996 scoping meeting, it was proposed that a 
sediment white paper be prepared in the first year which summarized the 
contaminated sediment problem, specified key obstacles, and identified options 
to address these obstacles. The sediment white paper would then serve as the 
basis for a workshop which was held in June 1997. This approach to the sediment 
priority was presented and endorsed by the IJC at its April 1996 Semi-annual 
Meeting in Washington, D.C. It is recognized that there are undoubtedly other 
aspects of the contaminated sediment issue which require further investigation 
and should be addressed in the future. 
<P><A name=intro><B><U>INTRODUCTION</B></U></A> 
<P>There is a consensus among diverse sectors in the Great Lakes Basin (e.g., 
government, industry, nongovernmental organizations, Remedial Action Plan 
groups) that contaminated sediment is a major cause of environmental problems 
and a key factor in many of the impairments to beneficial uses of the Great 
Lakes. All 42 Great Lakes Areas of Concern have contaminated sediment based on 
application of chemical guidelines. This universal obstacle to environmental 
recovery in Areas of Concern can potentially pose a challenge to restoring 11 of 
the 14 beneficial use impairments identified in the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement (Table 1). Adequate knowledge of impact is essential for determining 
the degree of impairment. A variety of remedial options are available, ranging 
from source control and natural recovery to full-scale remediation depending on 
the severity of the problem. Further, it is critical that some of these 
concentrated deposits of contaminated sediment be addressed relatively quickly, 
because over time they may be transported from a river or harbor to the Great 
Lakes. Once dispersed into the lakes, cleanup is virtually impossible.

Contaminated sediment is a major problem being addressed in Remedial Action 
Plans (RAPs) and Lakewide Management Plans (LaMPs), and is known to be an issue 
in other areas of the Great Lakes Basin. In recognition of the scope of this 
problem and the limited progress in managing contaminated sediment, the 
International Joint Commission (IJC) identified contaminated sediment as a 
priority for the 1995-1997 biennial cycle. Further, the IJC assigned this 
priority to the Great Lakes Water Quality Board and asked it to review the 
magnitude of the contaminated sediment problem and make recommendations to 
overcome major obstacles to sediment remediation. The purpose of this white 
paper is to summarize the contaminated sediment problem, specify key obstacles, 
identify options to address the key obstacles, and present workshop 
recommendations regarding value-added contributions the IJC could make to help 
address current obstacles to sediment remediation. 
<P><A name=why><B><U>WHY IS CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT A PROBLEM?</B></U></A> 
<P>Contaminated sediment has been identified as a source of ecological impacts 
throughout the basin. While contaminated sediment is not designated as a 
specific impairment in Annex 2 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 
in-place pollutants potentially pose a challenge to restoring 11 of the 14 use 
impairments (Table 1). The geographical areas which have received the greatest 
attention and level of evaluation are the Areas of Concern for which RAPs have 
been developed. RAPs have identified desired future states for the Areas of 
Concern, which include a healthy sustainable environment that supports a balance 
between ecosystem and economic health. Contaminated sediment is a major factor 
limiting the ability to attain these goals. Fish consumption advisories 
adversely affect sport and commercial fishing industries. Contaminated sediment 
threatens the viability of many commercial ports because of restrictions on 
dredging of navigational channels and disposal of the dredged sediments. For 
example, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the viability of the port for inter-lake and 
international cargo shipments is at risk due to the delays and expense 
associated with the management of the contaminated sediment. Municipalities and 
industries are also faced with increased costs of treating water drawn from the 
contaminated areas.

<P>Sediment also plays an important role in the physical movement, chemical 
partitioning, and biological fate of metals, trace organic pollutants, and 
nutrients. Heavy metals, many of the more commonly detected toxic organic 
chemicals, and nutrients are often closely associated with both suspended solids 
and bottom sediment. Furthermore, many contaminants have a low solubility in 
water and thus are found in concentrations several orders of magnitude higher in 
association with sediment particles. Fine-grained sediment has the potential for 
collecting the highest concentrations of contaminants. This sediment accumulates 
in low energy areas such as near shore embayments, river mouths, and harbors. 
Many of these areas are also recipients of urban, industrial and agricultural 
inputs of contaminants and require periodic dredging for navigational purposes. 
Over the five year period, from 1985 to 1989, over 15 million m<SUP>3</SUP> were 
dredged for navigational purposes throughout the Great Lakes. Fifty-one per cent 
of this, or approximately 8 million m<SUP>3</SUP>, had to be placed in some form 
of confined disposal facility due to high contaminant levels or because of a 
standing policy or regulation. This represents a significant increase in cost to 
navigation and associated commerce, as a result of other forms of disposal or 
reuse being precluded (Allan 1984; Golterman <I>et al.</I> 1983; Reynoldson 
<I>et al.</I> 1988; Zarull and Reynoldson, 1992; IJC 1991). For example, the 
costs associated with dredging and open water disposal are estimated to be $3-10 
U.S. per cubic yard, while the costs associated with dredging and confinement 
are estimated to be $10-50 U.S. per cubic yard. 
<P>The major environmental concern regarding contaminated sediment is the 
expression of impairment in biota, including humans. Impacts with direct links 
to sediment contaminants have been demonstrated for fish and benthic 
invertebrates. Information directly linking sediment contaminants with impacts 
on humans is sparse compared with other vectors such as air, water, and food. 
Since benthic organisms are a major food source for other ecologically and 
commercially important trophic levels, reductions in or changes to the benthos 
are of concern. As well, their uptake of persistent bioaccumulating substances 
and subsequent transfer to these trophic levels is also of concern. Similarly, 
other organisms such as bottom fish, which come into contact with the sediment, 
show effects including cancerous lesions. Concern has also been expressed 
regarding effects, including cancers, of toxic sediments on humans consuming 
fish from contaminated areas or engaging in water-contact activities (Swartz 
<I>et al.</I> 1985; Chapman 1988; Malins <I>et al.</I> 1984; Bauman and 
Harshbarger, 1985; Mix 1986; Becker <I>et al.</I> 1987; Black 1983). 
<P>Physical resuspension, along with biologically and geochemically mediated 
processes at the sediment-water interface, can substantially prolong the time 
during which sediment-associated contaminants remain bioavailable and accumulate 
in the food chain. Once buried in the deep sediment (below 10 cm) particles are 
often considered as lost to the system; however, two processes can result in the 
physical transport of contaminants back into the water column. Bioturbation, 
resulting from the activity of benthic invertebrates, can recycle material from 
as deep as 40 cm to the more active surface layer, thereby keeping contaminants 
circulating in the ecosystem much longer. The second process affecting the 
physical movement of contaminated sediment is their periodic resuspension by 
major storm events, internal waves, currents, and vessel traffic. Studies have 
shown that significant mass loadings of contaminants can be transported from a 
river into the lake during high flow events (Cardenas and Lick, 1996). Sediment 
from the near shore eventually accumulates in the deep lake basins or moves 
through the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean (Allan 1984; Sorokin 1966; 
Karickhoff and Morris, 1985). This potential for long-term exposure of 
organisms, along with significant local impacts which can be associated with 
contaminated sediment, suggests that intervention (i.e., sediment remediation) 
is one option. Another option is the "no action alternative" (i.e., source 
control and natural recovery). 
<P>There are a number of economic concerns related to the presence and possible 
cleanup of contaminated sediment. Both potential and real costs must be 
considered, including: costs to navigation; costs of construction, monitoring, 
and maintaining secure dredge disposal facilities for sediment ranging from 
marginally contaminated to highly toxic; costs of specialized and/or 
long-distance transport of dredged material to a disposal site; and costs 
associated with loss of commerce while waiting for sampling and analysis, 
rulings, the approval of an existing disposal facility, or the construction of a 
new one. In addition, other costs can include: the loss of property values in 
both adjacent shoreline and water lots; the loss or deferral of development 
investment; the loss or depreciation of commercial value such as a contaminated 
fishery; the loss of income from such things as tourism and recreation; and the 
loss of existing capital investment, such as contaminated recreational sites 
like swimming areas and small craft marinas. 
<P>The costs of contaminated sediment cleanup are seemingly more 
straightforward; however, the questions of how much must be cleaned up and by 
what method, need to be answered very precisely. In addition, the costs of 
cleanup are quite situation-dependent. Just as the actual costs of having 
contaminated sediment are sometimes difficult to quantify, so too are the 
benefits accrued as a result of cleanup. Therefore, before either a cost-benefit 
analysis can be performed, or a cost-effective solution chosen, considerably 
more work will have to be done to quantify and address these unknowns. 
<P>Like many other issues in the Great Lakes, contaminated sediment is a complex 
of legal, economic, social, technological, scientific, and ecological issues. In 
order to achieve progress and ultimately closure, it is imperative that the key 
issues and obstacles be identified and that solutions, possibly site-specific 
ones, be implemented. 
<P><A name=involve><U><B>IJC INVOLVEMENT IN CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT IN THE GREAT 
LAKES</U></B></A> 
<P>Since the signing of the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the IJC 
has been intimately and regularly involved in the issues relating to 
contaminated sediment. The IJC has provided guidance and assistance to the 
Parties, as well as performing their evaluative roll on Parties activities and 
programs. The continued involvement of the IJC has enabled the development and 
implementation of several significant programs and actions to address 
contaminated sediment. 
<P>Shortly after the signing of the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 
the International Working Group on the Abatement and Control of Pollution from 
Dredging Activities was formed. In their report of 1975, they concluded that the 
potential impacts from dredging could be significant. They recommended that a 
binational Great Lakes register of dredging activities be established and that a 
common means of assessing sediment contamination be established. Shortly after, 
the IJC's Research Advisory Board Expert Committee on Engineering and 
Technological Aspects of Dredging was established to look at the use of Confined 
Disposal Facilities (CDFs) for contaminated dredge spoils. This work led to the 
wider development and use of CDFs as a more environmentally sound means of 
dealing with contaminated sediment. 
<P>The signing of the 1978 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement prescribed the 
formation of a Dredging Subcommittee, reporting to the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Board. This group was responsible for the establishment and publication of the 
first (and subsequent) binational Great Lakes dredging register, which has 
provided a considerable degree of public information on sediment contamination, 
dredging projects and the disposal/reuse of dredge spoils. This group also spent 
considerable effort looking at the comparability of the different ways sediment 
contamination was assessed in Canada and the United States. As a result of this 
work, and an ecosystem focus called for in the 1978 Agreement, the Science 
Advisory Board (formerly, the Research Advisory Board) established a 
Contaminated Sediment Task Force to look at the assessment and potential 
remediation of contaminated sediment, beyond navigational dredging interest. 
This group expanded the examination of the problem and potential solutions 
beyond the Great Lakes, to involve experts from many other countries. Meanwhile, 
the Water Quality Board, taking a closer look at monitoring and surveillance in 
Areas of Concern, produced a guidance document that included a more detailed 
assessment of contaminated sediment and incorporated much of the earlier work of 
the Science Advisory Board Task Force. 
<P>In 1986, the terms of reference for the Dredging Subcommittee were expanded 
to include a responsibility for non-navigational sediments, which led to the 
subsequent formation of the Sediment Work Group. This group remained very active 
over a number of years and produced several documents on sediment assessment and 
remediation. They also became intimately involved with RAP efforts, making 
several site visits and sponsoring symposia of international experts to: 
evaluate progress; provide advice and direction; and transfer techniques and 
technology to the RAP program. 
<P>In 1995, among its many and significant priorities, the IJC directed the 
establishment of the Sediment Priority Action Committee to: examine the Parties 
progress in managing contaminated sediment; identify the obstacles remaining to 
resolving any remaining problems; and identify the "value-added role" of the 
Commission in the issue. 
<P>Throughout the course of its involvement in contaminated sediment issues, the 
IJC has provided considerable "value-added" benefit to the Parties and the 
public at large. The establishment of a binational dredging register gave the 
public, and each Party, easy access to a considerable body of information. The 
meetings, reports and involvement of its many technical committees and task 
forces provided both thought provoking information and understanding to the 
public. This also provided the basis of several public forums and an unbiased, 
authoritative focus on the issues. The work of these committees also facilitated 
international cooperation and technology transfer, as well as a continued 
binational focus on a regionally significant problem. In total, the work of the 
Commission and its technical committees has significantly influenced and 
assisted the Parties' efforts related to contaminated sediment in the Great 
Lakes. 
<P><A name=obstacles><U><B>OBSTACLES TO PROGRESS AND SELECTED EXAMPLES OF 
OVERCOMING OBSTACLES</B></U></A> 
<P>Progress in sediment remediation has been slow for several reasons. These 
range from the inability to: define the extent of the problem or the source of 
the problem; develop a strategy to address the problem; define the clean-up 
standard; and/or acquire the funding or partners to accomplish the clean-up. 
Science and technology utilized for sediment remediation oftentimes are a 
modification of established technologies in other aquatic and terrestrial 
environments (e.g., soil treatment technologies). Modifications to those 
techniques, along with increased application costs and insufficient verification 
of effectiveness, slow the further application of those techniques to other 
locations. 
<P>There is also no single measure of success. Rather, success is measured on a 
site-specific basis. This in itself presents a challenge for those who may 
choose to enter into a partnership agreement for cleanup. Success should be 
defined as the degree to which the environmental or ecological impact of 
contaminants from sediment have been reduced or eliminated. Certainly there can 
be and has been progress in advancing projects toward remediation, however, 
implementation is the only step that results in progress toward restoration of 
the ecosystem. The assessment of success should also recognize whether the 
"local" goals and uses of the area are <IMG align=right height=277 
src="Geo-2-138_files/sedb02.gif" width=186>achieved. Further, there is a need 
for public acceptance of a step-wise, incremental approach to management of 
contaminated sediment and restoration of beneficial uses, since complete 
rehabilitation will require a long-term effort. 
<P>Science can dictate the state of the sediment quality, while socioeconomic 
and political forces will govern the final clean-up targets. Success should 
include incremental gains in environmental recovery of the system and extensive 
public participation in the decision-making process. 
<P>To assist in developing a broad-based understanding of this complex problem, 
major obstacles to sediment remediation have been identified and grouped into 
the following six categories: limited funding and resources; regulatory 
complexity; lack of a decision-making framework; limited corporate involvement; 
insufficient research and technology development; and limited public and local 
support. Presented below is a brief discussion of each category of obstacle. 
<P><U>Limited Funding and Resources</U> 
<P>Funding has been a perennial problem for many RAPs (Appendix 1), and the 
subject of a recent IJC workshop. RAPs have sometimes been characterized as 
being in one of two classes: the "haves" or the "have nots." Many RAPs are 
unable to secure even the base level of funding necessary to support 
state/provincial coordination and Public Advisory Committee (PAC) functions. The 
ability to secure funding for sediment remediation is especially problematic as 
this is often one of the largest single costs associated with RAP 
implementation. 
<P>In the U.S., virtually all of the sediment remediation completed to date has 
been funded as a result of enforcement actions taken against polluters, 
typically industries or municipalities (Appendix 1). This includes voluntary 
remediation taken under the threat of enforcement. Although Superfund has been 
responsible for most of the sediment remediation conducted in the U.S. (e.g., 
Waukegan Harbor, Illinois; Massena, New York), enforcement actions have been 
successful under other regulatory authorities (e.g., Black River, Ohio). The 
State of Wisconsin is advocating a voluntary approach to sediment remediation 
through the Fox River Coalition. A voluntary approach is likely to be most 
successful where the threat of litigation is lurking. 
<P>However, limited funding is not always a barrier to sediment remediation. 
Sediment remediation can be accomplished as part of a larger ecosystem 
restoration project. An example of such a project is occurring in the Milwaukee 
River Area of Concern where the removal of the North Avenue Dam is restoring the 
Milwaukee River to a free-flowing stream for anadromous fish populations and 
removing contaminated sediment from the aquatic ecosystem. 
<P>In contrast to the U.S., enforcement has not been as significant a source of 
funding for sediment remediation in Canada. Canada has no direct counterpart to 
the Superfund Program, and the threat of litigation is not as great an incentive 
to voluntary action as in the U.S. Most of the sediment remediation conducted in 
Canada, including the Welland River and Collingwood Harbour, has been conducted 
through partnerships developed by the RAP with the federal Great Lakes 2000 
Cleanup Fund, a multi-year program that has sponsored studies, demonstration 
projects, and full-scale remediation with industries and other partners. 
<P>Funding opportunities for some Areas of Concern with contaminated sediment 
may become even more limited. Enforcement-funded remediation has been completed 
at many of the sites where the evidence against the polluter(s) was 
overwhelming. At many of the U.S. Areas of Concern having contaminated sediment, 
there is no "smoking gun" to link the contamination with any polluter and 
enforcement may not be a viable source of funding. Without enforcement, or the 
threat of it, there is no source of funding capable of addressing the costs 
associated with large-scale remediation of sediment at U.S. Areas of Concern. 
With the termination of the federal Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund in several 
years, the principal source of funding for sediment remediation at Canadian AOCs 
appears uncertain. 
<P><U>Regulatory Complexity</U> 
<P>The regulatory maze for dredging, treatment, and disposal of contaminated 
sediment is a significant obstacle to remedial efforts in the U.S. (Appendix 1). 
Numerous federal and state environmental laws, with separate, and sometimes 
conflicting reporting and permitting requirements, may be applied to a sediment 
remediation project. Some of these laws, such as the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), were developed for 
control of solid wastes and industrial processes, and are difficult to apply to 
large volumes of dredged sediment which contain substantial amounts of water. 
<P>In an attempt to streamline the regulatory process, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) - Region 5 and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
have worked together to develop a method for State-approved TSCA permitting for 
disposal of PCB-contaminated sediments to licensed landfills. The U.S. EPA - 
Region 5 also recently completed a guidance document on design of confined 
disposal facilities for contaminated sediment that addresses RCRA and TSCA 
concerns. 
<P>In Canada, major sediment remediation projects have been the result of 
public-private partnerships (Appendix 1). Some of the greatest progress has been 
made where, with or without the threat of legal action, administrative 
flexibility and negotiation on cleanup levels have been used to achieve progress 
toward ecological restoration. 
<P><U>Lack of a Decision-Making Framework</U> 
<P>While the most urgent need in environmental management is to protect the 
ecosystem from further abuse apart from source control, the levels and rates for 
cleanup are not addressed in current sediment guidelines or criteria. Decisions 
to cleanup contaminated sediment depend on a large number of variables, one of 
which is sound science. A scientific framework for evaluating the ecological 
significance of contaminants in sediment, however, is lacking. Local 
decision-making has been hampered by lack of guidance on defining quantitatively 
acceptable or unacceptable conditions. Also lacking is a method for integrating 
a large number of environmental measurements. What is needed is a pragmatic 
decision-making framework that leads to the selection of ecosystem- and 
cost-effective options for management of contaminated sediment. 
<P>To progress from a contaminated sediment problem to the restoration of 
beneficial uses in an area will require a strategy that involves a phased 
approach, likely over several years, to achieve significant improvements. It is 
imperative that any active intervention for sediment management beyond source 
control be aimed at use restoration, based on the weight of evidence of the 
biological data that demonstrates action other than natural recovery is 
necessary. A realistic schedule should allow sufficient time for source controls 
to take effect. The strategy must reflect the practical constraints of sediment 
remediation technologies. 
<P>A sediment remediation strategy based upon biological effects was used to 
govern the sediment cleanup in Collingwood Harbour, Lake Huron. Where chemical 
guidelines were exceeded, biological information was gathered. Given the variety 
of possible responses of biota to the test sediment, the RAP used the absence of 
lethality in laboratory assays and/or the absence of severely impaired benthos 
to be the minimum criteria for sediment cleanup. A higher level of cleanup was 
selected by the PAC and the target achieved was the absence of chronic effects 
in the laboratory and presence of benthic communities comparable to reference 
conditions. The zones for sediment removal were mapped by biological endpoints. 
Following remediation in some zones of the harbour, metals in sediment did 
remain in excess of provincial guidelines. These metals were not bioavailable 
and were therefore left in place. A monitoring program to track recovery of the 
benthos is in place. 
<P><U>Limited Corporate Involvement</U> 
<P>Historically in the U.S., corporations have only been involved in sediment 
cleanup under the threat of litigation. However, there are promising initiatives 
like the Ashtabula River Partnership in Ohio and the Fox River Coalition in 
Wisconsin which have substantial corporate involvement and support (Appendix 1). 
Such experiences must be evaluated and shared elsewhere. In some instances, 
corporations seek independent parties to which they can contribute funding 
towards cleanup, however, such vehicles are rare. There is a need for greater 
corporate involvement in cooperative, cost-effective efforts to remediate 
contaminated sediment. Further, there is a need for research into mechanisms to 
facilitate these partnerships. 
<P><U>Insufficient Research and Technology Development</U> 
<P>Although many aspects of research and development have been advanced through 
Environment Canada's Great Lakes Programs and U.S. EPA's Assessment and 
Remediation of Contaminated Sediments and Superfund Innovative Technology 
Evaluation Programs, knowledge, in a number of areas, will need to be advanced 
before major progress can be achieved. Some of the key areas for research and 
development work include: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>accurate physical identification and differentiation of sediment deposits, 
  which will allow both cost-effective assessments and clean-ups; 
  <LI>a better understanding of chemical fate, distribution and behaviour to 
  assess existing and future potential risk; 
  <LI>further toxicity testing methodology development and standardization to 
  provide integrated, defensible and efficient techniques of assessment; 
  <LI>a greater understanding of the ecological impacts and implications of 
  low-level bioaccumulation, lab toxicity test results, community shifts and 
  species losses as a result of exposure to contaminated sediment; and 
  <LI>the integration of physical, chemical, toxicological and ecological 
  results into a decision-making framework. </LI></UL>
<P>Further work is also necessary on the implications and linkages of sediment 
contamination to human health (e.g., routes of exposure, long-term exposure 
effects, etc.), the economic and social costs and benefits of having and 
cleaning up contaminated sediment and the development and demonstration of 
environmentally and economically cost-effective technologies. 
<P><U>Limited Public and Local Support</U> 
<P>Since contaminated sediment is an "invisible" problem, it is more difficult 
to build public support for this type of problem than some other more obvious 
environmental problems. Moreover, there can be a number of reasons for a lack of 
public support, including: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>lack of understanding that contaminated sediment is contributing to 
  environmental impairments; 
  <LI>lack of consensus on alternative remedial options such as: dredge and 
  treat; dredge and place in confined disposal facilities; in-situ treatment; or 
  natural recovery (no action alternative); and 
  <LI>disillusionment due to slow progress in achieving cleanup (due to shortage 
  of funds; delays due to legal negotiations; delays due to lack of industrial 
  cooperation). </LI></UL>
<P>There is no doubt that strong public and local support is essential to 
sediment project implementation. There is strong agreement that the RAP process 
is an effective tool to gain public and local support for sediment remediation. 
RAPs offer a consensus-based, multi-stakeholder approach to build public support 
and understanding. The most successful example of this has been through the 
Collingwood Harbour RAP where stakeholders were equal partners in problem 
identification, goal setting, review of options, and selection of remedial 
actions for removal of contaminated sediment and restoring uses. Such success 
stories need to be shared and encouraged elsewhere. Based on the Collingwood 
Harbour RAP experience, it is important for RAPs to communicate complex data 
bases in plain language. This will help provide the necessary tools to help the 
public select and lobby for preferred remedial options. 
<P><A name=options><B><U>OPTIONS TO ADDRESS OBSTACLES</U></B></A> 
<P>If significant progress is to be made in restoring ecosystem integrity in 
Areas of Concern and other areas throughout the basin, then substantially 
greater progress must be made in overcoming obstacles in order to advance the 
management and cleanup of contaminated sediment. Presented in Table 2 are some 
preliminary options for IJC actions to address the six categories of obstacles. 
<P>Within each category of obstacle, options to address obstacles were 
identified as either high priority or lower priority ones. The Sediment Priority 
Action Committee first evaluated the probability of success (i.e., the chances 
of the IJC action achieving positive, intended results) and potential payback 
(i.e., the degree to which this particular action would address the obstacle) 
for each of the options. Only options which received a medium or high ranking in 
both probability of success and potential for payback were placed into the high 
priority option category. Based on this evaluation by the Sediment Priority 
Action Committee, a total of 15 high priority options were identified to address 
the six categories of obstacles to sediment remediation. It was also recognized 
by the Sediment Priority Action Committee that there are linkages among the 
options and a group of two or three related options may have an improved 
probability of success or produce higher returns if done in concert. 
<P>The primary intent of this exercise was to identify potential IJC options to 
address known obstacles to sediment remediation in the Great Lakes Basin. This 
information was compiled as background material for a June 1997 workshop. It is 
also hoped that this information will enhance broad-based understanding and 
support for moving forward on pragmatic management of contaminated sediment.

<P><A name=output><B><U>OUTPUT FROM JUNE 1997 WORKSHOP</U></B></A> 
<P>On June 18, 1997 a workshop entitled "Identifying the Value-Added Role of the 
IJC in Overcoming Obstacles to Sediment Remediation in the Great Lakes Basin" 
was convened in Collingwood, Ontario. Approximately 35 individuals participated, 
including representatives from WQB, SAB, Council, and SedPAC, and two 
Commissioners. 
<P>In general, workshop participants concurred with the categories of obstacles 
to sediment remediation that were identified in the white paper. Two breakout 
groups were then used in the workshop to identify the two or three most 
important IJC options to help overcome obstacles to sediment remediation. It was 
felt that incentives to corporate involvement are generally weak and poorly 
articulated, and that in most areas there is limited public and local support 
for sediment remediation. In addition, lack of a consistent but flexible 
decision-making framework continues to confound and frustrate RAP processes and 
other local sediment initiatives. 
<P>Workshop participants recommended two very important, value-added 
contributions IJC could make to help address current obstacles to sediment 
remediation: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>compile and disseminate information on the economic and environmental 
  benefits of sediment remediation; and 
  <LI>develop guidance for making decisions regarding management of contaminated 
  sediment. </LI></UL>
<P>Workshop participants also noted a number of other options IJC may want to 
pursue depending upon time and resource availability. These include: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Commissioners could be opportunistic advocates for sediment funding and 
  legislation (e.g. through Hamilton Harbour Status Assessment); 
  <LI>IJC could recommend in its Biennial Report that the Parties and 
  jurisdictions provide adequate staff to support sediment remediation efforts; 
  and 
  <LI>IJC could prepare materials and launch a binational marketing campaign 
  that would address the importance of contaminated sediment management. 
</LI></UL>
<P>SedPAC reviewed the two primary workshop recommendations and has proposed 
action plans for IJC's 1997-99 cycle to address each recommendation (Tables 3 
and 4). Specifically, these action plans lay out a series of complementary 
activities that could be taken by IJC and other organizations to help overcome 
obstacles to sediment management. WQB will be addressing these workshop 
recommendations during the 1997-1999 biennial cycle.

      <LI>In 1995-1996, approximately 14,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Polychlorinated 
      Biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated sediment near the North Bay/U.S. 2 Highway was 
      removed and disposed of in a nearby landfill. The remainder of the 
      PCB-contaminated sediment will be addressed by the end of 1998. When the 
      final removal is completed, approximately 92,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of 
      contaminated sediment will have been dredged from the river and shipped 
      off-site for disposal. The total project cost is estimated at $16

    <TD vAlign=top>Rouge River</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>The PCB-source area to Newburgh Lake (Evans Products Ditch Site) was 
      recently addressed by the MDEQ with support from U.S. EPA. Completed in 
      April 1997, approximately 7,300 m<SUP>3</SUP> of PCB-contaminated stream 
      sediment was removed and transported for disposal at a landfill in 
      Michigan and hazardous waste disposal facility in New York. The total 
      project cost was approximately $500,000. 
      <LI>In 1997, PCB-contaminated sediment is being removed from an 
      impoundment (Newburgh Lake) in the Upper Rouge River and placed in a 
      secure landfill. By the end of the project, approximately 306,000 
      m<SUP>3</SUP> of PCB-contaminated sediment will be removed. The project is 
      expected to be completed by July 1998. The total project cost is estimated 
      at $11.8 million. 
      <LI>In 1986, 30,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of zinc-contaminated sediment was 
      removed from the Lower Branch of the Rouge River by mechanical dredging 
      and placed in cell #5 of the Corps of Engineers' Pointe Mouille Confined

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Hamilton Harbour</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>In 1995, <I>in situ </I>capping used a layer of uncontaminated 
      material to uniformly cover PCB-and PAH-contaminated sediment. The project 
      was funded through the Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund at a cost of 
      $300,000. An additional $350,000 was provided by the National Water 
      Research Institute to further monitor and evaluate the project. 
      <LI>From 1992 to 1994, there was <I>in situ </I>treatment of contaminated 
      sediment in one industrial boat slip near the headwall area. Oxygen, iron 
      oxide, and calcium carbonate were injected. This was a demonstration 
      treatment to find the depth of contamination. The total project cost was 
      estimated at $323,000. </LI></TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top>St. Clair River</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>In 1996, Dow Chemical removed several thousand cubic meters of 
      pentachlorophenol-contaminated sediment. The removal took place about 1 km 
      south of the Cole Drain, about 30 m offshore. The total project cost was 
      estimated at $350,000.</LI></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Detroit River</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>Removal of contaminated sediment in Monguagon Creek, a tributary to 
      the Detroit River, was initiated in 1997. The project is funded largely by 
      Elf Atochem North America Inc., with an estimated cost of $3 million. When 
      the final removal is completed, approximately 12,250 m<SUP>3</SUP> of 
      contaminated sediment will have been dredged from the creek. 
      <LI>In 1993, approximately 3,075 m<SUP>3 </SUP>of contaminated sediment 
      was removed by Wayne County near a marina by Elizabeth Park. The total 
      project cost was estimated at $1.33 million.</LI></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Niagara River</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>In 1995, approximately 10,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of contaminated sediment 
      was removed from the Welland River (Ontario) using an Amphibex dredge. The 
      total project cost was estimated at $2.6 million. 
      <LI>In 1996, approximately 21,800 m<SUP>3</SUP> of contaminated sediment 
      was removed from the 102nd Street Embayment (New York). 
      <LI>In 1995, approximately 11,500 m<SUP>3</SUP> of contaminated sediment 
      was removed from Pettit Flume (New York). 
      <LI>In 1992, approximately 6,100 m<SUP>3</SUP> of contaminated sediment 
      was removed from Gill Creek (New York). The total project cost, which was 
      funded entirely by DuPont, was approximately $10 million. 
      <LI>In 1990, approximately 13,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of dioxin-contaminated 
      sediment from Black and Bergholtz Creeks (New York) was removed. The total 
      project cost was approximately $14 million.</LI></TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top>St. Lawrence River</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
      <LI>The New York portion of the AOC involves three major large industrial 
      sites. Ongoing remediation projects, as required by New York State and 
      U.S. EPA, address land-based and contaminated river sediment. Some 
      land-based projects involve shoreline and on-site wetland remediation. The 
      contaminated river sediment projects at each industry include: 
      <LI><B>General Motors</B> - During the summer of 1995, GM completed the 
      major portion of its St. Lawrence dredging with the removal of 
      approximately 11,500 m<SUP>3</SUP> of PCB contaminated river sediment. The 
      river work to date has cost $10 million. The extent of required treatment 
      and disposal for the dredged materials is under review. Further river 
      sediment remediation in a cove adjacent to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe 
      remains to be completed. Total project costs, including land-based actions 
      with groundwater recovery and treatment, are estimated to cost as much as 
      $70 million. 
      <LI><B>Reynolds Metals</B> - The required contaminated river sediment 
      removal project for the St. Lawrence River has not yet begun. This will 
      include shoreline remediation. The land-based plant site remediation, 
      which includes wetlands remediation, is nearing completion at a cost of 
      $53.7 million. The contaminated river sediment work is estimated to cost 
      an additional $57 million. 
      <LI><B>ALCOA</B> - The major "hot-spot" at the plant outfall in the Grasse 
      River was remediated in 1995 as part of a 'non-time critical removal 
      action." This involved the removal of approximately 3,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of 
      PCB contaminated river sediment. The results of this project are under 
      review as is the feasibility of other remedial alternatives downstream 
      from the outfall in the Grasse River up to the St. Lawrence River 
      confluence. Major land-based inactive hazardous waste site remediation at 
      the ALCOA plant site continues with 10 of the 14 Record of Decision sites 
      now completed. Overall remediation costs are estimated to be in excess of 
      $250 million.</LI></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <LI>From 1917 to 1979, the U.S. Steel Corporation (USS) disposed of large 
      amounts of coal tars in Steel Creek which runs adjacent to the USS 
      facility and empties into the St. Louis River. USS has proposed to build 
      an earthen berm around highly concentrated coal tars and then solidify the 
      wastes in place. After solidification, the area would be capped. The 
      Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) believes that this remedy will 
      protect the St. Louis River. If there are no administrative problems, this 
      remedial action should be completed sometime during the summer of 1997. 
      <LI>The Wire Mill Pond received wastewater from their wire mill and other 
      USS operations. The bottom of the pond is covered with 1-2 meters of oily 
      waste. Other contaminants include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons 
      (PAHs), cyanide, and other metals (including mercury). The MPCA has 
      informed USS that the contaminated sediment must be removed. In response, 
      USS has proposed to excavate and dispose of approximately 7,700 m<SUP>3 
      </SUP>of contaminated sediment from the Wire Mill Pond during the summer 
      of 1997 and place the sediment in a landfill. After excavation, the pond 
      will be filled and re-established as a wetland. 
      <LI>Under an agreement with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
      (WDNR), Murphy Oil USA has agreed to remove 75 m<SUP>3</SUP> of material 
      from Newton Creek and 1,850-3,150 m<SUP>3</SUP> of contaminated sediment 
      from a spill containment impoundment. The material will be combined with

      <LI>The issue here is more than just one of dredging contaminated 
      sediment. The ship channel is a very deep, narrow channel, and the 
      alteration in stream morphology has created a situation of low flow and 
      little opportunity for reaeration. During periods of high temperature and 
      low flow, the bottom waters in the channel will have dissolved oxygen 
      below water quality standards. This has created a complicated regulatory 
      issue between U.S. EPA, Ohio EPA, USACE, and shippers and dischargers in 
      close proximity to the channel. The Cuyahoga RAP has become very involved 
      in assisting to develop a plan to determine how to meet water quality

      <LI><B>ALCOA</B> - The major "hot-spot" at the plant outfall in the Grasse 
      River was remediated in 1995 as part of a 'non-time critical removal 
      action." This involved the removal of approximately 3,000 cu.m. of PCB 
      contaminated river sediments and accounts for 25% of the PCB contamination 
      in the Grasse River. The results of this project are under review as is 
      the feasibility of other remedial alternatives downstream from the outfall 
      in the Grasse River up the St. Lawrence River confluence. Major land-based 
      inactive hazardous waste site remediation at the ALCOA plant site 
      continues with 10 of the 14 Record of Decision sites now completed. Site 
      work includes remediating lagoons and wetland restoration. Overall 
      remediation costs are estimated to be in excess of $250 million.</LI></TD>

    <TD vAlign=top>U.S. EPA issued orders to the three major industries in the 
      Area of Concern to address contaminated river sediments. EPA orders 
      include the land-based activities at General Motors. NYSDEC is assisting 
      in the oversight of river dredging and has also issued orders to address 
      the land-based remediation at ALCOA and Reynolds Metals. <BR>Reynolds 
      Metals has nearly completed its land-based remediation; ALCOA has 
      completed 10 of 14 land-based hazardous waste sites; and, the General 
      Motors on site landfill has been temporarily capped. U.S. EPA is 
      considering Record of Decision (ROD) modifications for the treatment and 
      disposal of dredge materials at General Motors and Reynolds Metals. The 
      ROD modification decision will establish the remediation requirements for 
      the dewatered dredge materials stockpiled on the GM site as well as the 
      treatment and disposal of land-based contaminated soils at General Motors. 
      Reynolds Metals plans to begin its St. Lawrence River dredging remediation 
      in 1998. <BR>Primary use impairments that need to be resolved in the AOC 
      are fish and wildlife consumption restrictions, degradation of fish and 
      wildlife habitat, and transboundary impacts (e.g. downstream 
      considerations of the St. Regis Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne). The three 
      large major industrial remediation projects are designed to address these 
      use impairments. Once the remedial activities have been completed, these 
      use impairments will need to be monitored and reassessed to determine if 
      further impact is present and if any further remedial action is 
  needed.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
