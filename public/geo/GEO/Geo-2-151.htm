MILESTONES IN CLIMATE CHANGE, INTERNATIONAL UNDERTAKING TALKS

November saw the completion of two long negotiating processes - 
the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agriculture was adopted on 3 November in Rome by the FAO 
Conference and the negotiations under the Buenos Aires Plan of 
Action, setting out the details for Kyoto Protocol implementation, 
were brought to a close by negotiators at UNFCCC COP-7 in Marrakesh 
on 10 November. 

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agriculture - formerly called the International Undertaking or IU 
- was finalized after seven years of negotiations. The treaty 
establishes a Multilateral System for facilitated access to a 
specified list of plant genetic resources for food and 
agriculture, balanced by benefit-sharing in the areas of 
information exchange, technology transfer, capacity building and 
commercial benefit-sharing. The balance struck is between 
promoting food security and plant genetic resources for food and 
agriculture while managing and minimizing potential impacts in the 
contentious realm of international trade and agriculture politics. 
As such, the treaty represents a serious effort to address the 
intersection of international environmental, agricultural and 
trade law. 

The climate change negotiators in Marrakesh, on the other hand, 
finalized issues related to the political deal concluded at COP-6 
Part II in July in Bonn, attempting to resolve the outstanding 
technical issues relating to the implementation of the Kyoto 
Protocol, and thus pave the way for the Protocol's timely entry 
into force. The discussions and bargaining were intense, and in 
the end a package deal on a compliance system, the Kyoto 
mechanisms, accounting, reporting and review of information under 
the Kyoto Protocol, and land use, land-use change and forestry was 
(once again) agreed, as it was apparent that some of the remaining 
"technical" issues from Bonn had significant political undertones. 
The final deal was seen by some as a further watering down of the 
Kyoto Protocol. However, many participants and observers seemed 
satisfied with the fact that the Marrakesh Accords had at least 
sealed the deal allowing for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, 
and will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive multilateral 
approach that will and must continue beyond this Protocol.

Water and Mountains on the December Agenda

Two important meetings in the lead-up to the Johannesburg Summit, 
both focusing on the complex issues of water, will be held in 
December. The International Conference on Freshwater will be 
hosted by the German Government in Bonn, and will focus on the 
freshwater issues addressed in Agenda 21. At the same time, a 
global conference on oceans and coasts will be held in Paris, 
and will also prepare input for Johannesburg.

December will also see the official UN launch of the 2002 
International Year of the Mountains, which will be held in New 
York on 11 December. Linkages Journal's sister publication, the 
Earth Negotiations Bulletin, will be present at and report from 
each of these events.

PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT 2002

IIED CONFERENCE - EQUITY FOR A SMALL PLANET: The International 
Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) held its 30th 
Anniversary Conference from 12-13 November 2001 in London, UK. The 
Anniversary Conference was comprised of a one-day workshop 
followed by a one-day conference, and was held in collaboration 
with the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Canadian International 
Development Agency, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Canada, Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Sweden's International Development Cooperation Agency.

On Monday, 12 November, the International Workshop, hosted by the 
Canadian High Commission, outlined issues, presented themes and 
generated discussion. The conclusions of the workshop were 
presented to the International Conference, which was convened on 
Tuesday, 13 November and hosted by the Trade Union Congress. More 
than 450 participants attended the workshop and conference, 
including representatives of governments, NGOs, multilateral 
organizations, academia and the private sector.

Carrying a theme of "Equity for a Small Planet," the purpose of 
this event was to convene an International Forum that would 
consider the dynamic interactions between the processes of 
globalization and efforts to protect local livelihoods, with an 
emphasis on perspectives from the South, and to clarify many of 
the critical issues and emerging priorities to be forwarded for 
consideration at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(WSSD) in Johannesburg. The outputs of the conference consisted of 
a series of opinion papers that would provide input to the WSSD. 
The Sustainable Developments report outlining these discussions in 
detail can be found at: http://www.iisd.ca/sd/SDEQU/index.html


INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
STRATEGIES: The International Forum on National Sustainable 
Development Strategies (NSDSs) took place from 7-9 November 2001 
in Accra, Ghana. The Forum was convened by the UN Department for 
Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), in collaboration with the 
Government of Ghana, Department for International Development 
(DFID) of the UK, the Danish Government and the UNDP/Capacity 21 
programme, as part of the ongoing preparatory process for the 
WSSD. Seventy-three participants from 31 countries drawn from 
government, civil society, the private sector and international 
agencies participated in the Forum.

The purpose of the meeting was to debate lessons learned and best 
practices in NSDSs at the international level, improve 
understanding amongst participants, and recommend approaches that 
are relevant and likely to be effective in the foreseeable future. 
Among the topics considered were key principles and 
characteristics of sound NSDSs, countries' experiences in 
implementing already existing national frameworks for NSDSs, 
stakeholder experiences with NSDSs, the assessment of effective 
processes for NSDSs, and the strengthening of capacity for NSDS 
processes. Participants also deliberated on national and regional 
follow-up actions and discussed recommendations and conclusions 
for presentation at WSSD preparatory meetings.

The meeting's outputs consisted of the Draft Report of the Forum 
with country reports annexed, a draft of the UN document on 
guidance for preparing NSDSs, suggestions for key national and 
regional actions, and a draft of the document on development of 
criteria to assess the effectiveness of NSDSs. The Sustainable 
Developments report outlining these discussions in detail can be 
found at: http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/sd/nsds/ 

FIFTH MEETING OF THE CSD-10 BUREAU: The fifth meeting of the 
Bureau took place in New York from 1-2 November 2001. The Bureau 
was briefed on the state of preparations for the Johannesburg 
Summit and the outcomes of the preparatory meetings for the 
African and the Latin American and Caribbean regions. The Bureau 
also met with representatives of the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to discuss 
each organization's WSSD-related activities. In its presentation, 
the GEF informed the Bureau that it was convening four thematic 
roundtables focusing on Energy, Forest and Biodiversity, Land, 
Water and Food Security, and Cross-Cutting Issues such as 
financing for environmental sustainability. To ensure high-level 
participation, these Roundtables are scheduled to be held on the 
margins of planned meetings such as the Second PrepCom and the 
Financing for Development Conference. The IMF noted that promoting 
high quality sustainable growth required taking social and 
environmental concerns into account, and added that it was 
tracking government spending on social sectors. It also reaffirmed 
that its role in the Summit process will include continuing to 
work with the World Bank and OECD to achieve the Millennium 
Declaration goals through market access, equitable foreign 
investment and increased ODA. The World Back briefed the Bureau on 
the progress of the World Development Report, stating that the 
report will carry out a comprehensive review of existing 
development strategies, with a focus on the social and 
environmental impacts of these strategies. The Bureau suggested 
that the report should also address the issue of unsustainable 
patterns of consumption and production.

The Bureau decided that it would meet with all three groups again 
in Washington in December 2001 to further discuss their roles in 
the Summit process. Bureau members then approved the main issues 
for the brainstorming sessions planned from 15-16 January 2002 in 
New York. More information on the Fifth Meeting of the Bureau is 
available online at:

BIODIVERSITY

OPEN-ENDED INTER-SESSIONAL MEETING ON THE STRATEGIC PLAN, NATIONAL 
REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL 
DIVERSITY: The Open-Ended Inter-Sessional Meeting on the Strategic 
Plan, National Reports and Implementation (MSP) of the Convention 
on Biological Diversity (CBD) met from 19-21 November 2001, in 
Montreal, Canada. Over 180 participants from 100 governments, 
joined by representatives from intergovernmental, non-
governmental, and academic organizations attended the meeting. 
Delegates met in two working groups. Working Group I considered 
the strategic plan. Working Group II addressed implementation and 
operations of the Convention, national reports and the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development.

Disagreement over the strategic plan's vision and operational 
goals resulted in bracketed text. However, some delegates 
considered discussions to be a useful starting point, with 
consensus to be built at the sixth meeting of the Conference of 
the Parties (COP-6). Delegates seemed generally satisfied with 
their accomplishments on the more manageable tasks of providing 
recommendations towards increasing the efficiency and performance 
of CBD operations and reporting processes. The recommendations 
from MSP will be forwarded to COP-6, to be held from 8-19 April 
2002, in The Hague, the Netherlands. The Earth Negotiations 
Bulletin report outlining these discussions in detail can be found 
at: http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/vol09/enb09222e.html

SEVENTH SESSION OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL 
AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE OF THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL 
DIVERSITY: The seventh meeting of the Subsidiary Body for 
Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-7) of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) met from 12-16 November 
2001 in Montreal, Canada. Over 515 participants from 113 
governments and from intergovernmental, non-governmental, academic 
and indigenous organizations attended the meeting. Delegates met 
in two working groups. Working Group I focused on forest 
biodiversity and considered its status, trends and threats, held 
general discussions on recommendations relating to bushmeat, and 
addressed a work programme with elements on: conservation, 
sustainable use and benefit sharing; institutional and 
socioeconomic enabling environments; and knowledge, assessment and 
monitoring. Working Group II considered and prepared 
recommendations on agricultural biodiversity, including the 
International Pollinators Initiative, the plant conservation 
strategy, incentive measures, indicators, and environmental impact 
assessment. 

The forest work programme proved to be a considerable undertaking, 
which will require extensive intersessional work on actors, 
timeframes and process indicators. Overall, however, delegates 
seemed pleased with the substance of the final outputs, while 
noting that the challenge ahead is to prioritize activities within 
the forest work programme. Delegates also appreciated Working 
Group II's discussions on agricultural biodiversity, the plant 
conservation strategy, incentives, indicators, and environmental 
impact assessment. The recommendations from SBSTTA-7 will be 
forwarded to the sixth meeting of the Conference of the Parties 
(COP-6), to be held from 8-19 April 2002 in The Hague, the 
Netherlands. The task for COP-6 will be to make the necessary 
political decisions to ensure effective implementation of the work 
of the SBSTTA and other intersessional processes under the 
Convention. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report outlining these 
discussions in detail can be found at: 
http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/biodiv/sbstta7/

INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MANAGING BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL 
SYSTEMS: The International Symposium on Managing Biodiversity in 
Agricultural Ecosystems convened from 8-10 November 2001 in 
Montreal, Canada. The Symposium was organized by the United 
Nations University (UNU), the Secretariat of the CBD and the 
International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). This 
three-day Symposium brought together approximately 140 
participants from the academic, government, research and non-
profit sectors to share experiences, case studies, initiatives and 
ideas on the management of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems.

The Symposium was organized on a thematic basis covering the 
topics of: crop and livestock genetic resources; associated 
biodiversity and agro-ecosystem services; and landscape, scale and 
change. On each day, participants addressed a different theme, 
with presenters offering their research in sessions focused on 
specific aspects within the broader topic. Poster displays outside 
the meeting halls further explored the thematic areas. The 
Symposium's objectives were to: advance understanding of the 
complex process and mechanisms for on-farm management of 
biodiversity and their relation with farmers' livelihoods; compare 
and exchange experiences in encouraging profitable management 
practices and systems of biodiversity on farms; identify lessons 
learned for policy and capacity building; and contribute to, and 
promote, the implementation of the CBD Programme of Work on 
Agricultural Biodiversity. The Sustainable Developments report 
outlining these discussions in detail can be found at: 
http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/sd/mbae/ 

OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP ON THE INTERNATIONAL UNDERTAKING ON PLANT 
GENETIC RESOURCES: Negotiations on the International Treaty on 
Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (formerly the 
International Undertaking) were held from 30 October to 3 November 
2001, at the headquarters of the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) in Rome, Italy. The FAO Council, and an Open-
ended Working Group convened under its auspices, met from 30 
October to 1 November 2001, to resolve outstanding issues 
following the agreement's adoption by the sixth extraordinary 
session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agriculture (CGRFA-Ex6) held in June 2001.

The key outstanding issues discussed included: the treaty's 
relationship with other international agreements; definitions of 
plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) and 
genetic material; the application of intellectual property rights 
(IPR) to PGRFA covered by the agreement; and expansion of the list 
of crops included in Annex I (List of Crops). The negotiations 
also addressed unresolved text on financial resources and 
subsidies, decision-making by the Governing Body and the 
resolution on the treaty's adoption and interim arrangements. On 
Saturday, 3 November 2001, the draft treaty was submitted to the 
FAO Conference, where it was adopted by a vote of 116 in favor, 
zero against and two abstentions.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and 
Agriculture establishes a Multilateral System for facilitated 
access to a specified list of PGRFA, balanced by benefit-sharing 
in the areas of information exchange, technology transfer, 
capacity building and commercial benefit-sharing. Its objectives 
are the conservation and sustainable use of PGRFA and equitable 
benefit-sharing for sustainable agriculture and food security. The 
treaty also contains sections on general provisions, Farmers' 
Rights, supporting components, and financial and institutional 
provisions. The list of crops in Annex I includes 35 crop genera 
and 29 forage species. The treaty also recognizes the need for 
close links with the FAO and the CBD. The Earth Negotiations 
Bulletin report outlining these discussions in detail can be found 
at: http://www.iisd.ca/linkages/biodiv/iu-wg/ 

CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERE

SEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION 
ON CLIMATE CHANGE: The Seventh Conference of the Parties (COP-7) 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) was held in Marrakesh, Morocco from 29 October - 10 
November 2001. Over 4400 participants from 172 governments, 234 
intergovernmental, non-governmental and other observer 
organizations, and 166 media outlets were in attendance. The 
meeting sought to finalize agreement on the operational details 
for commitments on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases under 
the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. It also sought agreement on actions to 
strengthen implementation of the UNFCCC. In attempting to achieve 
these goals, which were set out in the 1998 Buenos Aires Plan of 
Action (BAPA), COP-7 intended to bring to a close three years of 
negotiations, and complete tasks left unfinished at COP-6 Parts I 
and II held in The Hague and Bonn, respectively. The Bonn 
Agreements - a political declaration on outstanding issues that 
was adopted at COP-6 Part II in July 2001 - served as the basis 
for delegates striving to finish their work.

From 30 October to 6 November delegates met in negotiating groups, 
closed drafting groups and informal consultations in their attempt 
to resolve outstanding issues, which included the mechanisms under 
the Protocol, a compliance system, accounting, reporting and 
review under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 
(communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and 
land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Ongoing 
negotiations were also held on draft COP decisions relating to the 
least developed countries (LDCs), the Consultative Group of 
Experts (CGE), and input to the WSSD.

The fifteenth sessions of the COP's subsidiary bodies met during 
COP-7 from 29 October to 8 November. The subsidiary bodies adopted 
draft conclusions on a number of issues, including national 
communications, administrative and financial matters, and 
methodological issues.

On Wednesday, 7 November, COP-7's High-Level Segment began, with 
ministers and senior officials seeking to bring negotiations to a 
successful conclusion. Informal consultations were facilitated by 
Minister Valli Moosa (South Africa) and Secretary of State 
Philippe Roch (Switzerland). After protracted bilateral and 
multilateral talks, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol 
Articles 5, 7 and 8, and input to the WSSD was proposed on 
Thursday evening, 8 November. Although the deal was accepted by 
most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the 
Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex I Parties that includes 
Canada, Australia, Japan, the Russian Federation, and New Zealand) 
did not join the consensus, with key areas of dispute including 
eligibility requirements and bankability under the mechanisms. 
However, after further extensive negotiations throughout Friday 
and into Saturday morning, a package deal was agreed, with key 
features including consideration of LULUCF Principles in reporting 
of such data and limited banking of units generated by sinks under 
the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The Earth Negotiations 
Bulletin report outlining these discussions in detail can be found

FORESTS

INTERNATIONAL EXPERT MEETING ON MONITORING, ASSESSMENT AND 
REPORTING: The International Expert Meeting on Monitoring, 
Assessment and Reporting took place from 5-8 November 2001 in 
Yokohama, Japan. The meeting focused on monitoring, assessment and 
reporting (MAR) on the progress towards sustainable forest 
management. Experts from 31 countries, international organizations 
and regional processes, and NGOs were in attendance. The meeting 
was hosted by Japan and co-sponsored by Australia, Brazil, Ghana, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway and the US. Participants heard 
presentations and broke up into working groups. The first two days 
focused on the role of criteria and indicators in MAR and 
sustainable forest management. On the third day, participants 
attended presentations on MAR and heard updates on the progress of 
implementation of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Forests/Intergovernmental Forum on Forests proposals for action, 
followed by discussions on these topics in the working groups. The 
report from this meeting will be transmitted to the second session 
of the UN Forum on Forests to be held next March in San José, 
Costa Rica. More information on this meeting is available through

TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT

FOURTH WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE: The Fourth 
WTO Ministerial Conference took place from 9-13 November 2001 in 
Doha, Qatar. One hundred and forty-two member governments convened 
to negotiate various aspects of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. 
Throughout the conference, trade ministers presented their views 
in plenary sessions on what the WTO should focus on over the next 
two years. Heads of delegation met on Saturday, 10 November to 
delineate issue areas identified as needing intensive consultation 
before a consensus could be reached on the Ministerial 
Declaration, the Ministerial Decision on Implementation-related 
Issues and Concerns, and the Declaration on Intellectual Property 
Rights and Public Health/Access to Medicines. 

Friends of the Chair were chosen to conduct consultations on six 
issue areas: agriculture; implementation; environment; rule-
making; new issues; and trade-related aspects of intellectual 
property rights (TRIPs). A seventh Friend of the Chair was 
appointed on Monday, 12 November to handle consultations on issues 
such as labor standards, TRIPs and biodiversity, and dispute 
settlement reform that were not covered by the six existing 
groups.

After extensive negotiations, Members adopted a Ministerial 
Declaration on 14 November, launching a new round of trade 
negotiations scheduled to conclude by 2005. In addition to 
allowing Members to engage in negotiations on traditional issues 
such as agriculture and services, the new Declaration also 
launches negotiations on environment, industrial tariffs, anti-
dumping, fisheries subsidies, regional trade agreements, dispute 
settlement, and the "Singapore" issues of investment, competition 
policy, transparency in government procurement, and trade 
facilitation. With respect to environment issues, Member agreed to 
launch negotiations on: the relationship between WTO rules and 
specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental 
agreements (MEAs); procedures for regular information exchange 
between MEA secretariats and the relevant WTO committees, and the 
criteria for the granting of observer status; and the reduction or 
elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental 
goods and services. Other outcomes of this meeting include a 
Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health and a waiver for the 
European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) 
countries for their preferential EU-ACP "Cotonou" market access 
arrangement. More information on this meeting is available from

WETLANDS

EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA SUBREGIONAL RAMSAR MEETING: 
Approximately 50 participants from nine Ramsar Contracting 
Parties, seven nations currently undergoing the accession process, 
and two of the Convention's International Organization Partners, 
met from 12-14 November 2001 in Lusaka, Zambia, for the Eastern 
and Southern Africa Subregional Meeting. The meeting undertook a 
national and subregional evaluation of the implementation of the 
Convention's strategic plan and work plan in the region and 
discussed the challenges ahead. In particular, participants 
contributed input to the major tools and guidance currently under 
development for consideration by the Eighth Conference of the 
Parties (COP-8) to be held in Valencia, Spain, in November 2002. 
Special attention was paid to the need for integrating wetland 
issues into the overall sustainable development effort and to use 
wetlands as valuable assets for poverty eradication and socio-
economic development. It was urged that the Convention include in 
its future work the development of guidelines on prevention and 
possible responses to emergencies and disasters related to 
wetlands, in cooperation with the UN system and relevant 
secretariats. Finally, the meeting, echoing the recent South 
American subregional Ramsar meeting, called on the Ramsar Standing 
Committee to consider the desirability of adding socio-cultural 
and economic benefits and functions to the Criteria for 
Identifying Wetlands of International Importance, in light of the 
pre-eminent importance of issues of human uses of wetlands amongst 
developing countries. More information on this meeting is

WILDLIFE

SEVENTH WORLD WILDERNESS CONGRESS: The seventh World Wilderness 
Congress was held from 2-8 November 2001 in Port Elisabeth, South 
Africa. The week-long event was organized by the Wilderness 
Foundation South Africa, the International Wilderness Leadership 
(WILD) Foundation and the UK Wilderness Trust. Seven hundred 
delegates from 44 nations were in attendance to hear presentations 
and participate in consultations, debates and decisions on 
wilderness conservation and protection. Highlights of this Summit 
included the announcement by the Global Environment Facility of 
two new grants of US$1 million each to South Africa and Angola to 
assist wilderness and wildlands conservation. In addition, a 
wilderness area near Port Elisabeth, the first on private property 
in Africa, was declared, while Namibia announced new wilderness 
legislation and new proposed plans for a Wilderness National Park. 
Two new fundraising strategies for African Protected Areas were 
introduced: My Acre of Africa, an internet-based, public 
fundraising strategy for Southern African parks, protected areas 
and local communities; and the African Protected Areas Initiative, 
a new strategy addressing the need for more financing for all 
African protected areas, which is to be developed and launched at 
the fifth World Parks Congress in Durban in June 2003. During the 
conference, U.S. Congressman Clay Shaw also announced the 
forthcoming introduction of a bill into the U.S. Congress to 
address unsustainable logging of tropical forests, using a number 
of different financial mechanisms such as debt swaps and buy-back 
of logging rights. More information on this meeting is available

DAMS COMMISSION FOLLOW-UP PROJECT LAUNCHED

A new project has been launched to support multi-stakeholder 
dialogue on issues raised by the World Commission on Dams. The 
"Dams and Development Project" (DDP) was set up under the auspices 
of UNEP on 1 November, and will follow up on some of the issues 
raised by the World Commission on Dams, an international group 
which concluded its work early this year. The aim of the DDP is to 
involve actors at the local, national and regional levels in 
support of sustainable development in the water and energy 
sectors. The DDP will disseminate information on the World 
Commission on Dams report and promote dialogue on issues addressed 
by the report, strengthen networking among stakeholders and 
facilitate exchange of information and advice. Jeremy Bird has 
been appointed as the preliminary coordinator of the DDP, which 
will soon be recruiting staff. A DDP Steering Committee is 
expected to meet in early December to discuss a variety of 
relevant issues, including the composition of a wider Dams and 
Development Forum.

ANTARCTIC SEABED CONTAMINATED BY HUMANS

Areas around Antarctic bases have been seriously contaminated by 
humans, according to a new report. The first State of the 
Environment Report on the land and seascapes of Antarctica's 
coastal Ross Sea region found contamination ranging from untreated 
sewage to dumped trash from New Zealand and U.S. bases, around 
which discarded beer cans are said in some places to outnumber 
natural sponges. Installations of sewage treatment plants at these 
bases have been planned for next year.

PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT 2002

EXPERTS CALL FOR "SENSE OF URGENCY" TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT 

Too little attention is being paid to sustainable development by 
people, politicians and the media, according to a panel of experts 
attending recent high-level discussions in the Carriage House in 
New York on the process leading to next year's Johannesburg 
Summit. "The extent to which we have actually implemented the 
outcomes from Rio is clearly inadequate," said UN Under-Secretary-
General Nitin Desai, who is also Secretary-General of the 
Johannesburg Summit. "The problem is we haven't been able to 
generate a sense of urgency among people and thus among 
politicians." Another panelist, Jeffrey Barber, the Executive 
Director of the Integrative Strategies Forum, added that the 
average American is unfamiliar with the concept of sustainable 
development, mainly because of lack of media coverage. "It's not 
newsworthy, it's complex and, as I've been told by many 
journalists, it's boring," Barber said. "And so politicians say 
that there isn't enough of a 'demand' from voters to discuss the 
issue." Other panelists spoke about the importance of linking 
development with issues of health and environment, and the need 
for better public access to information and participation in the 
decision-making processes that affect the environment.

LION POPULATIONS UNDER THREAT, WARNS GROUP

The number of lions in West and Central Africa is dwindling due to 
their small and fragmented populations, according to the African 
Lion Working Group. In its new report, the Group warns that the 
two largest lion populations in this area consist of 200 animals, 
while many isolated populations are as small as 50 animals. In 
order to avoid inbreeding, lion populations should consist of 500 
to 1,000 animals. There are only about 2,000 lions left in all of 
West and Central Africa, and the African Lion Working Group now 
estimates that only 10,000 to 30,000 lions remain in all of 
Africa, as opposed to a 1996 estimate of 30,000 to 100,000.

Over the next few decades, West and Central African lions are 
likely to be restricted to a dozen national parks, as more land is 
being used for agriculture and livestock breeding. The African 
Lion Working Group is preparing a lion management handbook and a 
scheme for the long-term conservation and monitoring of the lions.

BRAZILIAN ANIMAL TRAFFICKING MAPPED

Details of the extensive trafficking of endangered species taking 
place in Brazil have been released in a report by the Brazilian 
National Network Against the Trafficking of Wild Animals 
(RENCTAS). According to the study, which is the first to combine 
all data on animal trafficking in the country, 38 million animals 
are illegally stolen from their natural habitats each year, 
yielding local traffickers as much as one billion dollars in 
revenue. Forty percent of the estimated 400 criminal organizations 
smuggling animals in Brazil are also thought to be involved in 
other criminal activities. 

Brazil contains the largest number of plant and animal species in 
the world, notably in the Amazon rainforest. Smuggling of a wide 
range of species, from poisonous snakes to rare parrots, 
apparently targets lucrative foreign markets, where animals are 
sold for tens of thousands of dollars each. Animal smuggling is 
the third largest cross-border criminal activity after the 
smuggling of arms and drugs. The Brazilian government said the new 
report will be used as a working tool for addressing the animal 
trafficking problem.

CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT

NO AGREEMENT REACHED ON PESTICIDE TREATY

The FAO governing conference ended its 31st session without 
reaching agreement on the revision of the "International Code of 
Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides," a new 
framework for pesticide use that would reflect health and 
environmental concerns more strongly. The meeting made progress on 
articles of the code increasing the emphasis on integrated pest 
management and removing reference to safe use of pesticides in 
order to reduce risks. However, delegates to the meeting 
reportedly failed to agree on an article dealing with the 
registration procedure of intellectual property rights. The 
article will be reviewed over the coming year, and the Code may be 
adopted by the next FAO governing conference in 2002.

CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERE

CLIMATE CHANGE TRIGGERS GENETIC CHANGES

Scientists have found genetic changes in mosquitoes that are 
responding to climate change. The finding, made by scientists at 
the University of Oregon, represents the first concrete evidence 
of animals' genes changing because of climate change. The 
mosquitoes' life cycle, which is genetically linked to the length 
of daylight, has altered over the last 30 years. Mosquitoes now 
enter into their dormant pupae stage, something they need to do to 
survive winter, 10 days later in the season. This represents a 
genetic adaptation to longer, warmer summers, as the mosquitoes 
have adjusted their genetic response to environmental cues for 
preparing for winter. 

Many plants and animals are already known to have adapted to a 
warming environment. With this study, scientists note there may be 
a genetic basis for the seasonal changes seen. Genetic evolution 
in response to climate change can be rapid, and the consequences 
widespread because of the links between predators and prey in 
ecosystems. Harmful effects have already been reported in some 
animals, such as birds of the British great tit species, which are 
running out of insects to feed their chicks because they are 
nesting after caterpillars that have turned already into 
butterflies.

OCEANS AND COASTS

JAPAN CRITICIZED OVER WHALING PRACTICES

Japan has started its annual hunt of minke whale and Dall's 
porpoise in November, in spite of concerns raised by the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC), as well as other 
governments and environmental groups. The U.S. and New Zealand 
have condemned the Japanese taking of 440 Southern Hemisphere 
minke whales for "scientific purposes," noting a significant 
decline in populations. However, Japan's Institute of Cetacean 
Research has defended the hunt, arguing that it produces valuable 
scientific information. Critics allege that the meat ends up at 
Japanese restaurants, rather than being used exclusively for 
scientific research.

The Japanese whaling fleet also began its hunt of Dall's porpoise, 
in spite of a resolution passed by the IWC calling for its halt 
until a population estimate has been carried out. Some estimates 
suggest that up to 18,000 porpoises are killed in Japanese waters 
each year, which would represent the largest kill of any whale, 
dolphin or porpoise in the world. Japan has reportedly declined to 
take part in the small cetacean subcommittee under the IWC 
Scientific Committee or to provide information on coastal 
cetaceans. According to environmental groups, the Dall's porpoise 
population is being severely over-hunted, and has appeared in 
Japanese supermarkets labeled as whale meat.

MEDITERRANEAN STATES PLEDGE TO CUT SEA POLLUTION

Mediterranean states have committed to implement "all necessary 
measures" to eliminate sea pollution from land-based sources by 
2025. The agreement, which was reached mid-November at the 12th 
Meeting of the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the 
Mediterranean Sea, applies to land-based sources of pollution, 
which account for an estimated 80 percent of total pollution in 
the Mediterranean. Ministers at the meeting also agreed to reduce 
emissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by 50 percent by 
2005 and totally eliminate POPs pollution by 2010. Agreement was 
also reached on the preparation of a new legal framework on oil 
pollution, enabling governments to make use of modern technologies 
like satellites to monitor illegal washing by oil tankers and to 
take legal action against offenders. Other outcomes of this 
meeting include the addition of the Mediterranean Whale Sanctuary 
to the list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean 
Importance (SPAMIs), and a deal to bind countries involved to 
create an effective management plan and to guarantee the long-term 
viability of the area. Delegates also adopted a joint declaration 
on the protection of the Mediterranean Sea that will be presented 
at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002.

JOURNALS

/Sustainable Development

"Policy-related research in the field of sustainable development: 
challenges and choices." International Review for Environmental 
Strategies 2 (1, 2001), pp. 37-42. This article by Rajendra 
Pachauri considers sustainable development research, suggesting 
that while there are seventy known definitions of sustainable 
development, there is little clarity on operationalizing the 
concept. The author argues that part of the reason decision-makers 
and leaders in various societies, as well as communities, have 
been unable to operationalize or measure sustainable development 
lies in the fact that research has not yet established the options 
that exist, nor has it determined the divergences that can be 
identified, for evaluating what is sustainable and what is not.

"Agroindustrialization, globalization, and international 
development: the environmental implications." Environment and 
Development Economics 6 (4, 2001), pp. 419-433. In this article, 
Christopher Barrett, Edward Barbier, and Thomas Reardon explore 
the concept of agroindustrialization, which they identify as 
comprising three related sets of changes: growth of commercial, 
off-farm agro-processing, distribution, and input provision 
activities; institutional and organizational change in the 
relations between farms and firms both upstream and downstream, 
such as a marked increased in vertical integration and contract-
based procurement; and related changes in product composition, 
technologies, and sectoral and market structure. The article seeks 
to fill an apparent gap with regard to general analysis of the 
pathways by which such effects might occur, or of the instruments 
governments might have at their disposal to influence these 
pathways. Several other articles in the same issue of Environment 
and Development Economics provide specific case studies and 
commentaries. 

"Environmental security and the recombinant human: sustainability 
in the twenty-first century." Environmental Values 10 (3, 2001), 
pp. 289-299. This article by Michael Redclift examines the 
concepts of security and sustainability as used in contemporary 
environmental discourses. The author argues that, although the 
importance of the environment has been increasingly acknowledged 
since the 1970s, there has been a failure to incorporate other 
discourses surrounding "nature." In his opinion, the implications 
of the "new genetics," prompted by research into recombinant DNA, 
requires future approaches to sustainability to be more cognizant 
of changes in "our" nature, as well as those of "external" nature, 
the environment. 

/Biodiversity

"Biosafety and international trade: conflict or convergence?" 
International Journal of Global Environmental Issues 1 (1, 2001), 
pp. 87-103. Thomas Cors discusses the regulatory issue of 
addressing biotechnology under either the WTO regime or the 
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. He focuses on how the 
precautionary principle is addressed in each agreement, and 
considers multilateral developments for the conservation of 
biological diversity under the Biosafety Protocol as well as 
international trade, focusing on the WTO's Agreement on Sanitary 
and Phytosanitary Measures. He then examines the treatment of the 
precautionary principle under the WTO and the Biosafety Protocol, 
and concludes by considering how a conflict of international law 
would be resolved between the SPS agreement and the Biosafety 
Protocol.

"Transgenic crops and the environment: missing markets and public 
roles." Environment and Development Economics 6 (4, 2001), pp. 
435-457. This article by Sandra Batie and David Ervin argues that 
rapid change has left scant opportunity for investigation of the 
long-term consequences of transgenic crops on ecosystems or 
economic systems. The authors argue that economic theory suggests 
public goods will be neglected if the "Biotechnology Revolution" 
is left to market forces alone, as there are significant 
incentives for private firms to discount and neglect certain 
environmental impacts and to develop products that only meet the 
needs of those able and willing to pay. In addition, negative 
distributional impacts on rural societies and economies, and the 
long-term problems of insect and plant resistance, are unlikely to 
be factored in to the equation. The authors call for enhanced 
public roles with respect to the use of transgenic crops, 
supporting a precautionary approach in public policies addressing 
transgenic crops as one alternative to ensure that public concerns 
are taken into account.

/International Environmental Negotiations

"NGOs and state capacity in international environmental 
negotiations: the experience of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, 
2001." Review of European Community and International 
Environmental Law (RECIEL) 10 (2, 2001), pp. 168-176. This article 
by Pamela Chasek examines the problems that many countries - 
especially developing countries and small countries - face in 
multilateral environmental negotiations. The article, which is 
intended as a 'think piece' generating discussion and determining 
a course for further research in this area, contains a case study 
and survey on the role of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin - the 
sister publication of Linkages Journal - at international 
meetings.

"NGO influence in international environmental negotiations: a 
framework for analysis" and "A comparative look at NGO influence 
in international environmental negotiations: desertification and 
climate change." Global Environmental Politics 1 (4, 2001), pp. 
65-85 and 86-107. These two articles by Elisabeth Corell and 
Michele Betsill examine the NGO influence in international 
environmental negotiations. Noting that NGO participation does not 
automatically translate into influence in decision-making 
processes, the first article proposes a framework for how to 
analyze NGO influence. With the help of a set of indicators, 
observers can assess NGO influence in the process and outcome of 
negotiations. The second article demonstrates the utility of the 
framework by applying it to two cases: the negotiations of the 
1994 Desertification Convention and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The 
same research strategy, used in both cases, provides comparable 
research results. The article concludes by highlighting the goal 
of this exercise: to discuss the factors that affect NGO influence 
in international environmental negotiations. Based on the 
comparison of the desertification and climate change cases, the 
authors found five such factors. The nature, history and framing 
of the issue under negotiation all impact NGO influence. The 
political opportunity structure and the profile of participating 
NGOs also have consequences for NGOs' ability to influence 
negotiations. The authors suggest that awareness of these five 
factors can be useful for NGOs wishing to influence a particular 
negotiation.

/Trade and Environment

"Free trade and the environment-development system." Ecological 
Economics 39 (1, 2001), pp. 21-36. In this article, Brantley 
Liddle focuses on a simulation model to analyze the trade-
environment-development system. Based on the model, the author 
finds that the benefits of trade depend on country endowments and 
that the pollution effects of trade are closely tied to the 
benefits of trade. The model generally shows higher pollution 
levels under free trade than autarky. However, the results do not 
support the pollution haven hypothesis that trade causes less 
pollution in developed countries and more pollution in developing 
ones. Some developing countries produce more of the pollution-
intensive good, but ultimately consume less pollution under 
autarky because they have higher per capita income and thus invest 
more heavily in environmental upgrading under autarky. 

/Transboundary Waste Management

"Institutions for management of transboundary water resources: 
their nature, characteristics and shortcomings." Water Policy 3 
(3, 2001), pp. 229-255. This article by N. Kliot, D. Shmueli and 
U. Shamir, examines the evolution, structure and characteristics 
of the management systems of 12 transboundary river basins: the 
Mekong, Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Nile, Jordan, Danube, Elbe, Rio 
Grande and Colorado, Rio de la Plata, Senegal and Niger. The 
authors present the legal principles that guide the legal regimes 
governing the rivers, particularly the principle of equitable use 
of transboundary water resources and the obligation not to cause 
harm in the management of transboundary water resources. 

/Wildlife

"Measuring the productivity of threatened-species programmes." 
Ecological Economics 39 (1, 2001), pp. 53-66. In this article, 
Ross Cullen, Geoffrey Fairburn and Kenneth Hughey evaluate the 
effectiveness and cost efficiency of threatened-species 
programmes, noting that such expenditures are increasing in many 
countries. Stressing the need for a versatile unit of output in 
order to evaluate the programmes, the paper reports on how an 
output measure, COPY, and Cost-Utility Analysis methodology, are 
applied to evaluate New Zealand's threatened-species programmes. 
Programme effectiveness, cost, and cost-utility ratios are 
presented, with results showing wide divergences between the 
various programmes studied. The authors conclude that cost-utility 
analysis provides a practical means to evaluate the productive 
efficiency of many threatened-species programmes.

/Women

"Fighting violence against women." Development 44 (3, 2001), pp. 
6-8. In this article, Lenore Manderson studies the impact of 
violence on all areas of women's lives. She argues that the main 
challenge is to change the culture of masculinity that underpins 
male-female relationships and facilitates or excuses gender-based 
violence.

"Needed: a culture of masculinity for the fulfillment of human 
rights." Development 44 (3, 2001), pp. 48-53. Ruth Finney Hayward 
argues that the prevailing culture of masculinity leads to 
violence against women and girls and puts the healthy development 
of the next generation at risk. She calls on men and boys as 
partners to end gender violence, define new models of masculinity, 
and promote gender equality, exploring the benefits and risks of 
such action or lack of action. 

NEW PUBLICATIONS

/Climate Change

Climate Change: Science, Strategies, and Solutions (Brill Academic 
Publishers 2001) Edited by Eileen Claussen, Vicki Arroyo Cochran 
and Debra P. Davis, this book contains sections on the science and 
impacts of climate change, global strategies, economics, 
innovative solutions and current developments. Released by the Pew 
Center on Global Climate Change, the book focuses on: the 
increasingly strong scientific evidence that human activities are 
indeed changing our climate; present and projected impacts of 
climate change on agriculture, sea level, and water resources; the 
five key determinants that explain the major differences in 
projected costs of addressing climate change; the state of the 
U.S. and international political discussions, and the development 
of policy instruments to address this problem; and what nations, 
states, cities, and companies are currently doing to control the 
greenhouse gas emissions. For more information visit:

Designing Climate Policy - the Challenge of the Kyoto Protocol 
(Service Fachverlag 2001). This book, edited by Hanns Abele, 
Thomas Heller, and Stefan Schleicher, has been released by the 
Austrian Council on Climate Change. It contains chapters by 
Stephen Schneider, Stanford University, on the climate for 
greenhouse policy in the U.S. and the incorporation of 
uncertainties into integrated assessments, and by Peter Hammond, 
Stanford University, on how to limit greenhouse gas emissions - 
lessons from public economic theory. Also, Andries Nentjes of the 
University of Groningen has written on design options for flexible 
instruments, Resources for the Future's William Pizer has 
contributed a chapter on designing climate policy to address 
uncertainty, and Josef Janssen of the University of St. Gallen has 
examined whether international emissions trading jeopardizes joint 
implementation.

International Emission Trading - from Concept to Reality 
(International Energy Agency 2001). This book by the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) provides a review of emissions trading, moving 
from a "perfect" system envisaged in economic models to a more 
realistic view of how trading can actually work. The book 
incorporates results from market experiments and modeling 
undertaken by the IEA and other institutions, providing in-depth 
consideration of implications for the power-generation sector. It 
also contemplates how developing countries could be included in a 
future trading regime. The analysis includes assessments of the 
"commitment period reserve" agreed at COP-6 Part II in July and of 
the CO2 market without the United States. For more information

are the industry's gift to a polluted globe or a "competition-
killing" strategy on the part of the developed world; the 1999 
Multi-Effects Protocol of the Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution and whether it could be considered as 
the most sophisticated environmental agreement ever negotiated; 
the development of the Basel Convention, its links with other 
international agreements, and its future prospects; how the UN 
Fish Stocks Agreement can contribute to ensuring the continued 
availability of the ocean's fishery resources; and how the World 
Bank could succeed in integrating environmental concerns in its 
lending practices. For more information visit:

/Population

UNFPA State of the World Population 2001: Footprints and 
Milestones - Population and Environmental Change (UNFPA, November 
2001). This volume of the annual UN Population Fund report 
examines the links between environmental conditions, population 
trends and prospects for alleviating poverty in developing 
countries. It discusses the relationship of poverty, over-
population and environmental degradation, and presents current 
statistics and projections into the future. For more information

/Trade and Investment

Public Subsidies and Policy Failures: How Subsidies Distort the 
Natural Environment, Equity and Trade and How to Reform (Edward 
Elgar 2001). In this book, Cees van Beers and Andre de Moor 
demonstrate how public subsidies can harm the environment, distort 
trade, and benefit those in society who do not require support. 
The authors propose policy strategies and international "Grand 
Deals" in key sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, energy and 
forestry, which they suggest may result in effective subsidy 
reforms. They also propose the establishment of new international 
structures to institutionalize the review and reform of subsidies. 
The authors conclude by arguing that subsidy reform, and in 
particular the "Grand Deals," should be placed at top of the WSSD 
agenda, and urge political leadership and determination in 
eliminating unsustainable policies at this meeting. 

Sustainable Finance and Banking: The Financial Sector and the 
Future of the Planet (Earthscan 2001). This book by Marcel Jeucken 
provides an account of banking and finance, their role in public 
policy, economic performance, commerce and industry, and 
implications for sustainable development. The author notes that 
those working in the financial sector are generally unaware of the 
rationale and pressures for sustainable development and its 
bearing on their work, while those in the relevant research and 
policy areas commonly overlook how vital the financial sector is 
for progress. Jeucken therefore provides a comprehensive account 
of their interdependence, including why the financial sector is 
crucial to achieving sustainability and why the "triple bottom 
line" of commercial, environmental and social success provides a 
path forward for the banking sector. From a systematic assessment 
of major banks around the world, he presents an account of current 
best practice, an analysis of the differences in approach and 
performance, and recommendations of actions and policies for 
improved performance that could contribute to sustainable 
development. For more information visit:

/Sustainable Development

E-Commerce and Development Report 2001 (UNCTAD, November 2001). 
This publication reviews trends and discusses the impact of e-
commerce on the global economy and on such economic sectors as 
tourism and finance. It considers legal and regulatory issues 
arising from the advent of the electronic age and is intended 
largely as a guide for developing countries in putting the digital 
revolution to work for them. It is also intended as, inter alia, a 
reference tool for policy makers and practitioners in developing 
countries and for the UN Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT) Task Force. The report is available online at:

Farming Systems and Poverty: Improving Farmers' Livelihoods in a 
Changing World (FAO and World Bank, November 2001). This new 
report has been produced as part of the World Bank Rural 
Development Strategy. It notes that although small farmers produce 
much of the developing world's food, they are generally poorer and 
less food secure than the urban poor. Farming populations are 
projected to remain at their current levels over the next 30 
years, and the report stresses that investment priorities and 
policies must take into account the diversity of opportunities and 
problems facing small farmers. The study builds on numerous case 
studies from various regions to build a farming systems approach 
as a framework for understanding the needs of those living within 
the system. The report identifies global challenges, opportunities 
and priorities, and provides an outline for how to move forward. 
The report is available online at:

Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth (Earth Policy 
Institute 2001). This book by Lester Brown sets out how the 
transition to an eco-economy could occur. Brown identifies both 
sunset and sunrise industries, and outlines current developments 
in the world in this regard. Among the sunset industries are coal 
mining, oil pumping, clearcut logging, and the manufacture of 
internal combustion engines and throwaway products. Among the 
sunrise industries are wind turbine manufacturing, hydrogen 
generation, fuel cell manufacturing, solar cell manufacturing, 
light rail construction, reforestation, and fish farming. The 
author stresses population stability, changing the materials 
economy from linear flow-through to comprehensive recycling and 
environmental tax reform as other key characteristics of an eco-
economy. He states that building an eco-economy represents the 
greatest investment opportunity in history, but notes that 
companies need to have the "vision" to take advantage of this 
opportunity. He concludes by noting that almost all the components 
for an eco-economy can be found in at least one country, and 
argues that the challenge ahead is for each country to put all the 
pieces of an eco-economy together. The book is available free-of-
charge online at: http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/index.htm 

/Johannesburg Summit

In preparation for the WSSD, the International Institute for 
Environment and Development (IIED) has produced a new series, The 
Future is Now, to explore lessons from the past and options for 
the future. The second title of four publications, entitled Equity 
for a Small Planet, is now available. It contains chapters on 
particular situations that have more generally applicable lessons 
and raise a number of critical challenges that it argues should 
underpin the outcome at WSSD. These chapters address: standards 
and certification - a leap forward or a step back for sustainable 
development; corporate-community partnerships: fair deals or 
public relations; regoverning markets - market access for small 
producers; silver bullet or fools' gold - can markets for 
environmental services help conserve forests and reduce poverty; 
investment for sustainable development - the public/private 
interface. To access the report visit:

/Climate Change

After Marrakesh: The Regionalization of the Kyoto Protocol (CEPS 
November 2001). The Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) has 
produced a brief commentary on the implications of the Marrakesh 
Accords. The authors, Thomas Legge and Christian Egenhofer, argue 
that the international climate regime will become regionalized, 
with the European Union playing the defining role. The commentary 
is available online at: 
http://www.ceps.be/Commentary/Nov01/Marrakech.htm 

UNEP/GRID-Arendal has launched a new Climate Change Portal. As 
UNEP's gateway to new and updated climate change information, the 
Portal provides: greenhouse gas emission graphs showing emissions 
for each Annex I country; an interactive map service presenting 
national achievements towards reaching the Kyoto Protocol 
commitments; the latest assessments from the IPCC; an interactive 
climate model that lets website visitors experiment with and learn 
about climate change; and information on climate change 
categorized for quick reference. To access the Portal, visit:

Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets (Pew Center 2001). 
Prepared by Michael Margolick and Doug Russell for the Pew Center 
on Global Climate Change, the report uses case studies from 
various companies that have established climate-related targets 
for reducing their emissions and/or energy use to show how the 
adoption of such targets, along with concerted efforts to meet 
them, can help improve performance and bottom-line results. All of 
the profiled companies view their efforts to set and meet climate-
related targets as a way to reduce production costs and enhance 
product sales. The companies also report that, in working to 
achieve their targets, they are improving their prospects for 
success under future regulatory and market environments. The 
report is available online at: 
http://www.pewclimate.org/projects/ghg_targets.cfm 

/Trade and Environment

UNEP's Economics and Trade Unit has released two new papers 
entitled Economic Reforms, Trade Liberalization and the 
Environment: a Synthesis of UNEP Country Projects and Enhancing 
Synergies and Mutual Supportiveness of Multilateral Environmental 
Agreements (MEAs) and the WTO. The two documents summarize key 
elements of the work undertaken over the last two years by UNEP's 
Economics and Trade Unit on concrete linkages between trade, 
environment and development. Both reports are available at: 
http://www.unep.ch/etu/doha/papers.htm

/Women

Women's Action Agenda for a Healthy Planet 2002 and A Women's 
Dialogue Paper have been prepared under the auspices of the 
Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) and the 
REDEH Network for Human Development. The first report focuses on 
ten key themes, providing an overview, possible solutions and 
benchmarks and mechanisms in relation to each theme. The themes 
are: governance and sustainable development; globalization and the 
claim for transparency and accountability in the institutions of 
the global system; socio-environmental dimensions of conflicts and 
the arms race - the role of women in peace building; tensions 
between free market ideology and sustainable production and 
consumption goals; women's right to access and control of global 
public goods; women's sexual and reproductive health and rights 
and the environment; environmental security - protecting the 
health of present and future generations; protection of 
biodiversity, indigenous knowledge and resources; gender dimension 
of sustainable cities; and gaps and opportunities in education, 
communication and information technologies.

The second paper, prepared at the request of the Commission on 
Sustainable Development, compiles the perspectives of women as a 
major group based on input from women's groups engaged in 
implementing Agenda 21. These documents represent works in 
progress, and comments are welcomed. Both papers are available at:
