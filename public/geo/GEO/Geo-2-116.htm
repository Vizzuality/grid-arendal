<P>1. The "Academie de l'eau," with the participation of the water agencies 
("Agences de l'Eau") for Rhin-Meuse, Rhône-Méditerranée-Corse and 
Seine-Normandie, initiated discussion of the management of shared water in 
cooperation with the International Water Office (I.W.O.), the permanent 
technical secretariat for the International Network of Basin Organizations 
(I.N.B.O.). This paper is based in large part on the conclusions of the 
International Conference on Water and Sustainable Development, held in Paris, 
France in March 1998. The conference recommended that high priority be given to 
addressing the problems created by the sharing among several countries of 
rivers, lakes and underground water. </P>
<P><B><STRONG>From international rivers to shared resources </STRONG></B></P>
<P>2. A water resource can be considered to be 'international' as the result of: 

<OL type=i>
  <LI>its geography, if it flows through two or more countries, or 
  <LI>from a lack of full national sovereignty over a water resource, for 
  example in the case of a river used for navigation. </LI></OL>
<P>3. According to the United Nations, the number of rivers shared by several 
countries was approximately 245, before the break-up of the former Soviet Union 
and Yugoslavia. Of these river basins, 70 are in Africa, 55 in Europe, 40 in 
Asia, 33 in South America, 24 in Central America, 15 in North Africa and 6 in 
the Middle East. </P>
<P>4. Arising from its use for navigation, the linear idea of the transborder 
river was extended first to drainage basins and then to underground water 
supplying basins. </P>
<P>5. More than forty per cent of continental freshwater resources are shared, 
justifying the interest of international organizations in their management. The 
declaration of the International Conference on Water and Sustainable 
Development, held in Paris, France in March 1998 emphasized that "<I>a common 
vision of riverine countries is needed for the efficient management and 
effective protection of transborder water resources</I>." The conference's 
priority action programme states that it is desirable to: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>facilitate the exchange of accurate and harmonized information among 
  riverine countries; 
  <LI>promote consultation at all levels, especially within pertinent 
  international institutions and mechanisms; 
  <LI>define medium-range priority action programmes of common interest to 
  improve water management and decrease pollution </LI></OL><B><STRONG>
<P>General texts establish the principles </STRONG></B></P>
<P>6. The lack of a body of international law governing water resources is a 
major challenge to the efforts for acheiving cooperative management of shared 
water resources. Nonetheless, there are many agreements, conventions and 
multilateral treaties covering navigation, hydroelectricity, water quality and 
the general sharing of resources; specifically underground water and the overall 
management of water. </P>
<P>7. In this context the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971), through 
Artice 5 of its text, also provides a framework for transboundary cooperation 
for the sustainable use of wetlands and water resources. Article 5 of the Ramsar 
Convention states that "<I>the Contracting Parties shall consult each other 
about implementing obligations arising from the Convention especially in the 
case of wetlands extending over the territories of more than one Contracting 
Party or where the water system is shared by Contracting Parties. They shall at 
the same time endeavour to coordinate and support present and future policies 
and regulations concerning the conservation of wetlands and their flora and 
fauna</I>." At this Conference of the Conference of the Contracting Parties, and 
in this Technical Session itself, the signatories of the Ramsar Convention will 
consider and deliberate on "Guidelines for International Cooperation under the 
Convention" (Ramsar COP7 DOC. 15.20), of which a major component addresses how 
best to achieve cooperative management of shared wetlands and river basins. </P>
<P>8. These agreements, conventions and treaties constitute a mosaic of texts 
revealing differing orientations and basic principles of jurisprudence that will 
be strengthened in the near future in the light of increasing concerns over 
water quantity and quality. These concerns arise primarily from the impacts of 
population growth, irrigation and flooding. </P>
<P>9. Many case studies point to voluntary restrictions of a country's 
sovereignty over a river when it is considered to be an international river and 
a shared resource. The first principle that comes to light is that of 
"<I>equitable and reasonable use</I>." This requires that whenever a country 
uses the water of a shared water resource that it not deprive other riverine 
countries of their right to equitable and reasonable use. This rule is referred 
to as the 'non-harmful use of a resource'. It is universally recognized 
(Principles 21 and 22 of the 1972 Stockholm Declaration on the Environment). 
</P>
<P>10. Two important conventions for the protection of freshwater have also been 
established namely: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>the Helsinki Convention for the protection and use of transborder 
  waterways and international lakes. This convention sets out general principles 
  to be included in treaties binding riverine countries of a water resource to 
  use the best available technologies and the best environment-friendly 
  technologies; and. 
  <LI>the New York Convention on the law governing the utilization of 
  international waterways for purposes other than navigation. 
</LI></OL><B><STRONG>
<P>Much remains to be done</STRONG></B> </P>
<P>11. While recognizing that considerable progress has been made during the 
past ten years to codify principles and rules, thanks to an awareness of the 
United Nations and the signing of the Helsinki and New York conventions, it is 
quite obvious that there still is much to do. Some countries, however, are still 
reluctant to discuss this issue. The refusal of several countries to participate 
in discussions of a draft of an innovative international convention on the 
international law of shared rivers at a very recent conference in Lebanon is 
tangible proof of this reluctance. </P>
<P><STRONG><B>Proposals for creating effective structures for the management of 
shared water resources</B></STRONG> </P>
<P>12. International commissions for shared streams and rivers are organizations 
with a juridical status created by several riverine countries to facilitate 
consultation and broad coordination in order to use and manage common water 
resources better. </P>
<P>13. Tight "legal guidelines" have been developed by the United National 
during the past twenty years as a result of the work of these commissions to 
assist countries seeking to establish similar multi-state arrangements. They 
provide, however, only a safeguard. By establishing norms, they do encourage 
countries to agree and "to act reasonably and equitably." In point of fact, any 
country that does not respect these guidelines can be held responsible following 
a complaint by a country felt to have been harmed by the actions of the other 
country. </P>
<P>14. The actions called for, and the means to be used, are quite different 
when it is a question of proposing : 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>new legal norms and means of reconciliation that must be in accordance 
  with the United Nations guidelines 
  <LI>the constitution of commissions or the improving of the functioning of 
  international institutions and donors. </LI></OL>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>In the first case, it is a question of long-term actions because five to 
  ten years are needed for a new convention to become effective. 
  <LI>In the second case, proposals for improving the functioning of commissions 
  or financing by donors can produce results much more quickly. </LI></UL>
<P>15. The following paragraphs contain proposals for improvement concerning: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>the legal basis and an appeals process for resolving conflicts before the 
  International Court of Justice; 
  <LI>a proposal for establishing river commissions based on current 
  orientations and for creating an international forum of basin commissions tied 
  to the I.N.B.O.; and 
  <LI>a proposal concerning international institutions and donors. 
</LI></OL><B><STRONG>
<P>Additions to be made to the International Law of Water </STRONG></B></P>
<P>16. The principle of full territorial sovereignty, according to which a state 
has the full right to use the water within its territory as it sees fit, is no 
longer admitted. Notions of "<I>common interests</I>" of riverine countries and 
"<I>limited territorial sovereignty</I>" over shared water resources are now 
recognized, in order to provide all riverine countries with a reasonable and 
equitable share of water. </P>
<P>17. The Helsinki and New York Conventions set forth and developed these 
principles. They also emphasized the means to be used for their application, 
especially the principle of "<I>polluter-payer</I>" and that of "<I>rights to be 
protected for future generations</I>," both of which support the idea of 
sustainable development. They also took into account the notions of the 
"<I>hydrographic basin</I>" as a management unit, of preventing pollution at the 
source, and of prior authorization for discharging waste based on only the most 
advanced technologies. </P>
<P><STRONG><B>The need to expand current international regulations</B></STRONG> 
</P>
<P>18. In spite of this broad range of management principles, there are large 
gaps that should be filled. These gaps include: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>the need to provide clean water for everyone and especially for the least 
  fortunate, 
  <LI>the need for the integrated management of water resources with careful 
  planning to balance supply and demand, 
  <LI>the need to develop a network of accurate measurements and the exchange of 
  data among riverine states, 
  <LI>the importance of reinforcing the capacity of governments to cooperate 
  more fairly and efficiently with associates, especially international 
  partners, the private sector and local governments, 
  <LI>the promotion of the training of specialists and personnel for public 
  information, 
  <LI>the importance of support for incorporating these principles in national 
  legislation. </LI></OL>
<P>19. It should also be pointed out that no plan exists for mobilizing funds 
required for implementing effective policies. </P>
<P><B><STRONG>Creation of an International Water Tribunal </STRONG></B></P>
<P>20. At the present time, litigation between riverine countries is judged by 
the International Court of Justice or a few tribunals and courts established by 
associated countries or federations. </P>
<P>21. The creation of a tribunal specialized in water, under the auspices of 
the United Nations and perhaps as an adjunct of the International Court of 
Justice, would complete the panoply of norms concerning water in general and 
more specifically those concerning shared water, taking into account the body of 
law of judicial decisions stemming from these cases. </P>
<P><STRONG><B>A charter for International River Commissions</B></STRONG> </P>
<P>22. At the present time, the creation of international drainage basin 
commissions depends on the rules of international law, which must be respected, 
and on the experience provided by existing commissions. The commissions have, 
however, very limited knowledge of successful or failed experiences. </P>
<P>23. This is why, at a time when the international community seeks to create 
this type of commission, and as was emphasized at the Paris Conference on Water 
and Sustainable Development in March 1998, it is necessary to build up a code or 
charter of rules and options based on the experience of existing commissions. 
Countries deciding to reach agreement on cooperating in the management of their 
shared water resources will have at their disposal a foundation that can be 
adapted to the the specific conditions of the drainage basin in question. </P>
<P>24. This is what is described in the following paragraphs, emphasizing 
several pre-conditions to be implemented, in order to translate a desire to 
cooperate into effective action. </P>
<P><STRONG><B>Prior consultation</B></STRONG> </P>
<P>25. Countries sharing a drainage basin should establish frequent specific 
contacts in order to exchange information on the water resource and its 
management. A gradual approach is usually preferable. Contacts should first be 
at the technical level and be made through water and other relevant agencies by 
holding informal meetings in order to develop mutual confidence. These contacts 
and meetings of specialists can be held on a rotating basis in each of the 
countries in a drainage basin, reaching out to local populations affected by 
projects and for discussion of several simple topics: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>A network for measuring the water quality and quantity, as well as 
  rainfall. 
  <LI>An analysis of information on the quantity and type of water used for 
  various purposes and waste discharge, as well as purification techniques and 
  means. 
  <LI>Exchanges of information on the protection of watertables, wetlands, 
  floodplains, riparian and catchment zones. 
  <LI>Presentation of information on constructions for regulating flow for 
  navigation and flood prevention and the likely impacts of these. </LI></OL>
<P>26. After this initial phase, exchanges can seek to prepare a technical 
report on the drainage basin, describing the water cycle in light of the needs 
of the local inhabitants in each part of the basin, making it possible to point 
out local problems in all parts of the basin, as well as existing or potential 
problems in parts of the drainage basin belonging to each of the riverine 
countries. </P>
<P>27. The discussion can be expanded to include all the parties and be enlarged 
to include a global approach to the problems affecting local populations and 
agriculture, including the protection of the fauna and flora. There should be: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>an exchange of information on wetlands and their conservation as well as 
  on measures taken for the protection of the environment, 
  <LI>an analysis of the planning required for the management of the resource, 
  including balancing of supply and demand and reduction of demand (water 
  savings and recycling), 
  <LI>a study of the effect of upstream and downriver activities, 
  <LI>a comparison of the resources used for training technicians, water users 
  and the public, 
  <LI>presentation of management techniques used in the associated countries for 
  water supply and drainage, planning, irrigation, flood control, water 
  legislation (water police, authorization for use and waste discharge) and 
  mechanisms for financing constructions. </LI></OL>
<P>28. Management of transborder freshwater is possible only if the affected 
countries accept limitations to their sovereignty over that water resource. This 
requires a convention or treaty to define this limitation. This is, of course, 
the obstacle which can hinder the development of a partnership between riverine 
countries. </P>
<P>29. After these points have been studied and a consensus has been reached by 
the partner countries at the political level, the formation of management 
commission can be considered. This will require reaching agreement on 
objectives, means to be used and operating methods as well as recourse available 
in the event of disagreement (for example, intervention requested and agreed 
upon of international or regional organizations on request and by mutual 
agreement). </P>
<P><B><STRONG>Pre-conditions for river basin commissions </STRONG></B></P>
<P>30. The initial stage begins with the desire of at least one of the riverine 
countries to reach agreement with other riverine countries. 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>either because the studies called for in the previous paragraph have shown 
  that there are problems affecting or potentially threatening a water resource 
  that can be solved only through concerted action; or 
  <LI>because it is determined that adverse effects (pollution, temporary water 
  scarcity, etc.) are caused by activities in a country that is not respecting 
  international law. </LI></OL>
<P>31. Agreement should be reached on an outline giving the details of 
programmes, studies to be made, exchanges of technical information and division 
of tasks into those to be carried out jointly and those remaining in the 
competence of each country. </P>
<P>32. <B><STRONG>The convention or protocol should include the following 
points</STRONG></B>: the purpose of the cooperation, especially if it covers 
only specific problems (navigation, electricity generation, division of 
available water, anti-flood constructions and pollution control) or if the 
purpose is the overall management of water resources in the basin. </P>
<P>33. In order to fulfil the objectives of joint programmes, provision should 
be made for: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>studies and the exchange of information 
  <LI>construction and management of installations where essential (dams and 
  water purification plants) 
  <LI>the training of personnel, users and associations 
  <LI>public information </LI></OL>
<P>34. <STRONG><B>Fiscal and financial arrangements</B></STRONG> for fulfilling 
objectives should be discussed even if, in almost all cases, they concern the 
internal administration in individual countries and should remain within 
national jurisdiction. Fiscal and financial policy have a strong impact on 
objectives, especially in the case of: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>the policy of polluter-payer or user-payer, 
  <LI>the setting of tariffs for use, consumption and to influence demand, 
  <LI>the taxing of the use of pollutants such as fertilizers or pesticides. 
  </LI></OL>
<P>35. Defining signatories to the convention and the role of the commission is 
for each country in the water basin to decide with possible participation of 
associated international bodies. The aspects to be defined include: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>division among signatories of financial support for operations, 
  <LI>definition of participation of users in the discussions and decisions, 
  <LI>the legal status of the commission, giving it a status in relation to the 
  signatories and the host country of the future permanent secretariat, 
  <LI>resolution of conflicts arising among signatories. These should be 
  investigated by a special office specifically created by the commission. 
</LI></OL><B><STRONG>
<P>Creation of a Forum of International Drainage Basin Commissions 
</STRONG></B></P>
<P>36. National river basin commissions have been formed in many countries and 
these are quickly joining the International Network of&nbsp; Basin Organizations 
(I.N.B.O.) in order to facilitate communication and to benefit from the 
experiences of others. It seems that the creation of a Forum of International of 
Drainage Basin Commissions (F.I.D.B.C.) would be quite desirable and useful as 
well. </P>
<P>37. In fact, the long established commissions, which have acquired valuable 
knowledge, are being requested to aid or advise new commissions or those 
encountering difficulties or problems. </P>
<P><STRONG><B>Recommendations for international and regional 
institutions</B></STRONG> </P>
<P>38. These institutions have three additional roles to play in supporting the 
management of international river basins beyond their usual functions: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>provide neutral experiences to aid in resolving difficulties, 
  <LI>contribute to promoting the harmonization of the commission's networks of 
  measurements and the training of technicians and users, 
  <LI>assist the less-developed countries to reach the level of performance of 
  the more developed countries through external aid. </LI></OL>
<P>39. The first role is that traditionally played by the World Bank and other 
United Nations agencies such as FAO, WHO, WMO, UNEP and UNDP. They can intervene 
at the request of the countries concerned. This is facilitated if the World 
Bank, the leader of the international organizations, is one of the signatories 
of the agreement. It can contribute to ensure that the programme is useful and 
efficient. </P>
<P>40. The second role is linked to the financial aid that these organizations 
can provide or mobilise to assist countries, or the commission, for programme 
implementation. They can decide to use part of their aid for training or 
harmonizing measurements. </P>
<P>41. The third role is very important because through favorable interest rates 
they can help to ensure that the work required for the programme is carried out 
at the same rate in rich and poor countries, which is essential for preventing 
the effectiveness of a joint programme being compromised by delays in some 
parties in a basin. </P>
<P>42. When evaluating requests for assistance, donors must be ensure that the 
programme for which assistance is requested takes into full account the rules of 
international law. They act as important safeguards to prevent future conflicts. 
</P>
<P>43. The financial organizations of the United Nations could contribute by 
lowering interest rates and increasing the amount of aid for this type of 
programme in developing countries. </P>
<P>44. Regional organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), or the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (BERD) can play similar roles. </FONT></P>
