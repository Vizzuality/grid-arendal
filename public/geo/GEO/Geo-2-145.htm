                  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Statistics compiled 
                  in 1981, showed that 22 percent (600,000 persons) of the 
                  Province's population depended upon groundwater for water 
                  supply. Although the volume of groundwater extracted amounts 
                  to only ten percent of total water consumption in British 
                  Columbia, because of the large quantities of water used in the 
                  province, this represents twenty-five percent of all the 
                  groundwater extracted in Canada. The largest use of 
                  groundwater in the province is by industry (55%), followed by 
                  agricultural (20%), municipal (18%) and rural domestic (7%). 
                  Certain areas are entirely dependent upon groundwater for 
                  water supplies. </FONT>

                  interference where large capacity wells lower water levels and

                  wells which are allowed to flow freely thereby wasting water 
                  and lowering water levels and yields in neighbouring wells, 
                  (e.g. Surrey, Okanagan, Gulf Islands, Saanich);</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"

                  where surface water is fully licensed and groundwater 
                  extraction depletes surface flows and availability, (e.g. 
                  Cherry Creek /Kamloops, Chimney Creek / Williams Lake,

                  Okanagan Valley).</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In some 
                  areas of the Province, shallow groundwater is also susceptible 
                  to non-point or diffuse sources of contamination from various 
                  activities, such as the unregulated use of chemical 
                  fertilizers and pesticides combined with excessive irrigation 
                  practices, and the application, disposal and storage of animal 
                  wastes on land. Elevated levels of nitratenitrogen in excess 
                  of the Canadian Drinking Water Quality Guideline of 10 mg/L, 
                  for example, have been found in a significant number of 
                  domestic wells in the LangleyAbbotsford, Osoyoos and Grand 
                  Forks areas of the Province. Point sources of contamination 
                  such as abandoned landfills, chemical spills and former 
                  industrial sites are also causing water quality degradation in 
                  some areas. </FONT>
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In 1982, 
                  the Ministry of Environment (Water Management Branch), in 
                  cooperation with the well drilling industry, prepared 
                  Guidelines for Minimum Standards in Water Well Construction, 
                  Province of British Columbia. Compliance with these standards 
                  ensures that water wells are drilled and finished in a manner 
                  that protects the health, safety and welfare of the public and 
                  the integrity of the resource.</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>These have 
                  been adopted in varying degrees by water well drillers, 
                  consultants in the industry and local governments but are not 
                  mandatory on a province-wide basis.</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In 1986, 
                  the Provincial Apprenticeship Board approved the designated 
                  trade of Water Well Driller and the regulations for trade 
                  qualification and certification by the Ministry of Labour (now 
                  the Ministry of Advanced Education and Job Training).</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Water well 
                  drilling is a recognized trade in the province, and 
                  individuals meeting the specified qualifications can hold a 
                  Certificate of Qualification as a Water Well Driller. 
                  Certification, however, is not mandatory for an individual to 
                  work at the trade. An approved training program for Water Well 
                  Drillers was finalized in 1986 under the auspices of the 
                  Ministry of Advanced Education and Job Training. The Program 
                  was developed by a Trade Advisory Committee comprised of 
                  representatives of the Ministry of Environment (Water 
                  Management Branch), the B.C. Water Well Drilling Association

                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In some 
                  areas, well interference problems and impacts on surface water 
                  resources are serious. Further well drilling and surface water 
                  allocation in these areas would threaten the integrity of the 
                  entire hydrologic regime, severely impacting individual water 
                  users and ecologic systems dependent upon the water resource. 
                  Groundwater maintains baseflows in rivers and streams during 
                  periods of drought and is a critical component to maintaining 
                  fisheries habitat and spawning areas. </FONT>
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Many 
                  groundwater quality problems emanate from inappropriate 
                  land-use practices directly over susceptible aquifers: eg., 
                  over-application and runoff of agricultural fertilizers and 
                  chemicals which may result in high nitrates and pesticides in 
                  groundwater; land disposal of sewage effluent; chemical spills 
                  or leakage from storage tanks and transportation facilities; 
                  poorly sited landfills; and incorrect waste disposal practices 
                  at former industrial sites. Infiltration of rainfall, snowmelt 
                  and streamflow in groundwater recharge areas may carry 
                  contaminants to groundwater especially in sensitive areas 
                  where water tables are shallow and surface soils consist of 
                  permeable sand and gravel deposits. Areas of groundwater 
                  discharge and immediate environs surrounding these sites 
                  (e.g., natural springs and wetlands), need to be protected 
                  from sources of contamination.</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Regulation 
                  of such land-based activities currently falls under the 
                  mandates of the Waste Management Act, the Pesticide Control 
                  Act and the Health Act.</FONT> 
                  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Property 
                  owners may carry out activities at or near well heads that can 
                  threaten the groundwater resource. Activities near wells such 
                  as storing or mixing chemicals, filling pesticide application 
                  containers, applying chemicals through irrigation systems or 
                  dumping waste materials can result in groundwater 
                  contamination. Unused wells in some instances have been used 
                  to dispose of various wastes.</FONT>

                  of the province, and in specific aquifers where contamination 
                  from non-point sources is evident. Point sources of 
                  contamination are monitored under the Environmental Protection 
                  Program. Water supply systems dependent upon groundwater are 
                  tested by the purveyors and the Ministry of Health. The Water 
                  Quality Check Program administered by the Ministry of

                  levels of constituents or from human-induced sources. From an 
                  allocation perspective, groundwater use without provisions for 
                  adequate treatment should not be allowed in areas of known 
                  risk to human health. Areas of known or suspected
