Policy Study: Water Resource Management in West Asia</B></FONT> 
<P><I>This study was carried out by the Arab Centre for the Studies of Arid 
Zones and Drylands (ACSAD), Republic of Syria, in collaboration with the Arabian 
Gulf University (AGU), Bahrain, as part of the preparation for UNEP's GEO-2000 
report.</I> 
<P><FONT color=#002e96 face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif 
size=4><B>Summary</B></FONT> 
<P>The high population growth rate in the West Asia region exceeds by far the 
rate of developing water resources. Consequently, the annual per capita share of 
water resources is decreasing, and at an increasing rate. This study shows that 
developing water resources on a business-as-usual basis will leave the region 
with serious water shortages, in particular in the Arabian Peninsula where the 
annual water deficit could increase to as much as 67 percent of demand by 
2015.</P>
<P>It is clear that current water resources cannot satisfy future demand much 
past 2005 without alternative policies. Two alternative policies are examined: 
in one water supplies are increased, and in the other water supplies are 
increased and policies altered. The scenarios show that water deficits can be 
reduced - though not eliminated - especially if emphasis is placed on cutting 
the wasteful use of water in agriculture, which accounts for the majority of 
water use in the region, and by shifting current policies away from stressing 
food self-sufficiency.</P><A name=contents></A>

<P>The 4-million-square-kilometre West Asia region can be divided geographically 
and ecologically into two sub-regions, the Mashriq and the Arabian Peninsula. 
The region comprises 12 states with a total population of 85.6 million in 1995. 
The Mashriq, with a 1995 population of 45.1 million, includes Lebanon, Syria, 
Jordan, Iraq and the territories of the National Palestinian Authority (NPA). 
The Arabian Peninsula, with a 1995 population of 40.5 million, includes Bahrain, 
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.</P>
<P>The great majority of the region (over 72 per cent) has an annual rainfall of 
less than 100 millimetres; about 18 per cent receives between 100 and 300 
millimetres; under 10 per cent receives between 300 and 1 300 millimetres (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#acsad1997" 
onclick="showRef('acsad1997'); return false;">ACSAD 1997</A>). About 80 per cent 
of the region is therefore classified as semi-desert or desert land (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#aoad1995" 
onclick="showRef('aoad1995'); return false;">AOAD 1995</A>), 16 per cent is 
subject to desertification, and only 10 per cent is suitable for agriculture 
(2.3 per cent under irrigation and 7.7 per cent under rainfed cultivation).</P>
<P>Estimates of conventional (surface and groundwater) and non-conventional 
water resources (desalinated water, wastewater and agricultural drainage) in the 
region as of 1995 are given in <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table1.htm">table 1</A>. Annual 
rainfall provides around 443&nbsp;000 million cubic metres (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#acsad1997" 
onclick="showRef('acsad1997'); return false;">ACSAD 1997</A>), of which 41 per 
cent falls in the Mashriq and 59 per cent in the Arabian Peninsula. Surface 
water resources are estimated to be 88 300 million cubic metres in the Mashriq 
sub-region and 8 310 million cubic metres in the Arabian Peninsula.</P>
<P>Groundwater exists in both sub-regions, including both shallow and deep 
aquifers. In the Arabian Peninsula, groundwater in the shallow alluvial 
aquifers, located along the main wadi channels and the floodplains of drainage 
basins, is the only renewable water resource, with an approximate annual 
recharge of 5 020 million cubic metres a year. The Mashriq has frequent low- to 
medium-intensity rainfall of long duration which favours groundwater recharge. 
Hence the estimated annual recharge is better, at 8&nbsp;515 million cubic 
metres a year.</P>
<P>Shallow aquifer reserves are estimated at 130&nbsp;500 million cubic metres 
in the Arabian Peninsula; approximately 13&nbsp;300 million cubic metres is 
available in the Mashriq. Coastal alluvial aquifers in the Arabian Peninsula are 
subject to salt water intrusion due to extensive groundwater withdrawal which 
has caused salinisation of coastal agricultural lands, resulting in the 
reduction of agricultural production and the complete loss of some arable land. 
Similarly, in the Mashriq sub-region the discharge of raw and partially treated 
wastewater from agriculture, industry and municipalities into water courses is a 
cause of deep concern over its health impacts; it has subjected agricultural 
land and water resources to severe pollution, and has contaminated shallow 
aquifers.</P>
<P>The main source of water for the countries of the Arabian Peninsula is 
non-renewable fossil groundwater stored in sedimentary deep aquifers. These 
store significant amounts of groundwater that is thousands of years old. Deep 
groundwater reserves are estimated at 2&nbsp;175 thousand million cubic metres, 
with the major portion (1&nbsp;919 thousand million cubic metres) in Saudi 
Arabia (<A href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#alalawi1993" 
onclick="showRef('alalawi1993'); return false;">Alalawi and Abdulrazzak 
1993</A>). However, recharge to all deep aquifers is estimated at a very limited 
2&nbsp;700 million cubic metres per year. The quality of the deep aquifers 
varies greatly; only in a few areas is it suitable for domestic consumption. 
Most of the water from these deep aquifers is used for agricultural 
purposes.</P>
<P>Groundwater resources in West Asia in general, and the Arabian Peninsula in 
particular, are in a critical condition because the volumes withdrawn far exceed 
natural recharge rates, resulting in a continuous decline in groundwater levels 
and a deterioration in water quality caused by the encroachment of sea water 
into coastal alluvial aquifers and the up-flow of connate waters in inland 
aquifers. A 1995 comparison between the Arabian Peninsula's annual groundwater 
recharge (7&nbsp;200 million cubic metres) and groundwater abstraction rates 
(23&nbsp;600 million cubic metres), indicates that the mining of groundwater 
reserves in the Arabian Peninsula is about 16&nbsp;400 million cubic metres; by 
country, groundwater depletion rates (in millions of cubic metres) are: Bahrain 
- 100; Kuwait - 200; Oman - 240; Qatar - 140; Saudi Arabia - 13&nbsp;558; UAE - 
1&nbsp;495; and Yemen - 700 (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#fao1997" 
onclick="showRef('fao1997'); return false;">FAO 1997</A>).</P>
<P>In the Mashriq, there is growing evidence of groundwater depletion in many 
countries, such as Jordan, Syria and the Gaza Strip, where groundwater use has 
been increasing, largely because of a decrease in surface water availability 
(MSE/UNDP 1997). In addition, over-irrigation and surface dumping of partially 
treated wastewater has generated large volumes of contaminated water, increasing 
the pollution levels of shallow aquifers.</P>
<P>Desalination technology was introduced in the mid-1950s and has developed 
very rapidly to counteract the shortage in conventional water sources. The 
majority of the region's desalination plants are found in the Arabian Peninsula; 
saltwater treatment facilities in the Mashriq are few and of small capacity. The 
45 desalination plants operating in the Arabian Peninsula as a whole in 1992 had 
a total designed capacity of 2 320 million cubic metres, equivalent to 41 per 
cent of global capacity (Bushnak 1990; Wagnick 1992), and a total 1995 output of 
some 1 645 million cubic metres (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#zubari1997" 
onclick="showRef('zubari1997'); return false;">Zubari 1997</A>). The cost of 
water desalination ranges from US$1/m<SMALL><SUP>3</SUP></SMALL> to 
US$1.5/m<SMALL><SUP>3</SUP></SMALL>. All desalination plants have some negative 
effects on the environment since they cause air pollution by emitting oxides and 
marine pollution from the rejected brine.</P>
<P>Wastewater treatment in the Arabian Peninsula constitutes an increasing water 
source driven by escalating water consumption in urban areas. Existing sewage 
treatment facilities, which process primary wastewater and have a processing 
capability estimated at 921 million cubic metres a year, could handle about 43 
per cent of all domestic wastewater. However, the reused treated wastewater, 
which does not exceed 392 million cubic metres a year, is used mainly for 
irrigating fodder crops, gardens, highway landscapes and parks (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#zubari1997" 
onclick="showRef('zubari1997'); return false;">Zubari 1997</A>). The remainder 
is dumped at disposal areas to infiltrate shallow aquifers, or into the sea. In 
the Mashriq, wastewater, except in large cities, is discharged into watercourses 
and only part of it is used for irrigation purposes.</P>
<P>Recycled irrigation water is not used much in the Arabian Peninsula since 
excess irrigation water infiltrates the lower horizons and ultimately reaches 
the groundwater table; only in Saudi Arabia, in Al-Hassa Oasis, is about 30 
million cubic metres a year of irrigation water reused in agriculture by mixing 
it with groundwater (Al-Kuwaiti and others 1999). In the Mashriq sub-region only 
Syria exploits these water sources, with some 1&nbsp;210 million cubic metres 
being recycled annually. This source has, however, future potential given proper 
irrigation practices are applied. Other forms of non-conventional water sources, 
such as rainwater harvesting, weather modification, etc. are still in the 
research stage.</P>

<P>Population growth in West Asia is a major issue affecting all sustainable 
socio-economic development. The estimated population in 1995 was 85.6 million 
(<A href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#unspd1997" 
onclick="showRef('unspd1997'); return false;">UNSPD 1997</A>) with an average 
growth rate of 3.73 per cent for the Arabian Peninsula (Arab Fund 1995) and 3 
per cent for the Mashriq countries. Population projections for West Asia over 
the period 1995-2015 are given in <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table2.htm">table 2</A>.</P>
<P>The total water used for all purposes in the West Asia region in 1995 
amounted to 96&nbsp;065 million cubic metres (29&nbsp;565 million cubic metres 
in the Arabian Peninsula and 66&nbsp;500 million cubic metres in the Mashriq); 
average per capita water use in the same year was estimated to be 730 cubic 
metres a year for the Arabian Peninsula sub-region and 1&nbsp;475 cubic metres a 
year in the Mashriq (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table3.htm">table 3</A>).</P>
<P>The high population growth rate in the region exceeds by far the rate of 
water resource development. Consequently, the annual per capita share of water 
resources is decreasing, and at an increasing rate. According to the Global 
Water Assessment, the share per individual in the Arab world has decreased 
during the last two decades from 2&nbsp;200 cubic metres a year to 1&nbsp;100 
cubic metres a year.</P>
<P>Five countries of West Asia have a per capita water use of under 500 cubic 
metres a year, half the benchmark of 1&nbsp;000 cubic metres a year which 
indicates chronic water scarcity (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#wri1996" 
onclick="showRef('wri1996'); return false;">WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB 1996</A>). Only two 
countries, Iraq and Syria, actually exceed the 1&nbsp;000 cubic metres a year 
benchmark; Saudi Arabia and UAE have done so only by mining their groundwater 
reserves.</P>
<P>The national economy of most countries of West Asia depends on oil and 
oil-related industries, commerce, light industries, and agriculture, in this 
descending order. Due to the fast increase in population and urbanisation, 
domestic water and industry needs are escalating at rates with which available 
water resources cannot keep pace. Furthermore, the adopted policy of food 
self-sufficiency imposes continual constraints on the allocation of water 
resources, which would otherwise reduce the share for agriculture in favour of 
increased domestic and industrial demand. Currently the agricultural sector 
takes 85 per cent of available water resources in the Arabian Peninsula and 95 
per cent in the Mashriq, followed by domestic water use, 14 per cent and 4 per 
cent respectively, with industry in both sub-regions accounting for less than 2 
per cent. </P>
<P>The water stress experienced by the countries of West Asia in 1995 is 
expressed in <A href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table4.htm">table 
4</A> as the percentage of available water resources actually used. The index 
reaches values of over 100 per cent in five of the seven countries of the 
Arabian Peninsula and critical values in the remaining two. This indicates that 
these countries have already exhausted their renewable water resources and are 
now exploiting non-renewable reserves.</P>
<P>In the Mashriq the water stress index looks better, except for Jordan where 
it is over 100 per cent. However, all countries of this sub-region have critical 
conflicts concerning shared water resources which remain to be reconciled. 
Furthermore, not only are per capita water resources below 1&nbsp;000 cubic 
metres a year in 9 out of the 12 countries of West Asia, in 7 countries 
(Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, NPA, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Yemen) they are even below 
500 cubic metres a year. The overall value of the water stress index for West 
Asia is 84.4 per cent, which is considered very critical. It is worth mentioning 
that groundwater reserves were depleted by over 17&nbsp;000 million cubic metres 
in 1995.</P>

      <P>The development in water demand for sectoral users (agriculture, 
      domestic and industry) depends on the normal growth rate of the population 
      in West Asian countries which is currently 3-4 per cent. As an 
      alternative, the medium variant scenario (UNST/ESA/SER.A/145) is used. The 
      1990 population was used as the base year for the projections, which cover 
      the 20-year period 1995-2015.</P>
      <P>The rates of domestic (A) and industrial (B) water consumption are 
      taken from national reports for 1995. The proposed increases in rates of 
      water consumption are based on estimates of the general availability of 
      water resources, the status and trends of urbanisation, predicted rates of 
      industrial development, and anticipated agro-industrial developments and 
      other social development targets.</P>
      <P>Estimated rates of agricultural water demand (C) are based on 1995 
      national reports. Increases are based on population growth. A gradual 
      reduction of agricultural water demand (at rates from 5 per cent, to 10 
      per cent, and eventually 17 per cent) is foreseen in the 2000-2015 period 
      due to anticipated improvements in agricultural production research in the 
      fields of genetic engineering and tissue culture, and particularly due to 
      savings in consumptive use.</P></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Clearly, policies regarding the development and rational use of water 
resources throughout the region urgently need reviewing. Projections of the 
total sectoral water demand in West Asia over the period 1995-2015 (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table5.htm">table 5</A>) are based 
on the criteria explained in the box right. </P>
<P>The increase in water demand across all sectors will be 47&nbsp;130 million 
cubic metres by 2015 and it is evident that agriculture will continue to 
dominate all other uses. Furthermore, from the available water resources in 1995 
of 113&nbsp;759 million cubic metres (96&nbsp;612 million cubic metres surface 
water, 13&nbsp;050 million cubic metres rechargable groundwater and 4&nbsp;097 
million cubic metres non-conventional water resources (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table1.htm">table 1</A>)), the 
anticipated water demand in 2015 of 143&nbsp;195 million cubic metres (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table5.htm">table 5</A>), and the 
deteriorating water stress index, it is clear that current water resources 
cannot satisfy future water demand much past 2005 unless positive steps are 
taken soon to rationalise water demand management, increase and augment supply, 
and impose realistic controls on use.</P>
<P>The Arabian Peninsula is already suffering from a deficit in water resources. 
The 1995 total annual water demand of 29&nbsp;565 million cubic metres is 
estimated to grow to 47&nbsp;320 million cubic metres by 2015 whereas the total 
available water will hardly exceed 15&nbsp;400 million cubic metres. Under these 
circumstances it will be difficult to maintain the regional emphasis on food 
production and the widespread import of foodstuffs will increase by 
necessity.</P>
<P>Currently the water deficit is partially compensated for by the 
over-exploitation of shallow and deep fossil aquifers and by the extensive 
installation of highly expensive desalination plants. The negative impacts 
include fast depletion of aquifer reserves, possible conflicts arising from 
differential use of aquifers shared between states, deteriorating water quality 
and salinisation of agricultural lands. Furthermore, existing wastewater 
treatment facilities can cope with only 35 per cent of urban and industrial 
waste. Pollution from inappropriate disposal of untreated wastewater will create 
health hazards through the contamination of shallow groundwater aquifers.</P>
<P>These issues are all aggravated by a general weakness among the institutions 
dealing with water affairs. This is due to inadequate technical capabilities and 
unsatisfactory coordination between concerned water authorities.</P>
<P>The Mashriq sub-region, with nearly ten times the renewable water resources 
of the Arabian Peninsula, is in a much better situation. Available resources can 
theoretically sustain the projected use of 95&nbsp;875 million cubic metres in 
2015. However, strict control measures are needed to curb current problems 
related to over-exploitation, inefficient re-use of wastewater, untreated 
industrial waste and pollution of shallow aquifers. Institutional capacity 
building and enforcement of legislation also require attention, as well as the 
continuing problem of potential conflicts between neighbouring states over the 
equitable distribution of shared water resources. <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table6.htm">Table 6</A> summarises 
the problems and critical issues in the water sector of West Asia. These 
problems are common in countries of both sub-regions, though the intensity of 
their environmental impact varies according to the geopolitical and 
socio-economic status of each country.</P><BR clear=all>

<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Introduction</B></FONT> 
<P>To develop policies which will ensure the sustainable development of water 
resources in West Asia, three scenarios, each based on different assumptions, 
were used to study the potential water balance for the period 1995-2015. The 
results of the three scenarios are shown in tables <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table7.htm">7</A>, <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table8.htm">8</A> and <A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table9.htm">9</A>. Proposed remedy 
policies detailing the range of desired actions for implementation are outlined 
in <A href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table10.htm">table 10</A>.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Scenario 1: Business as Usual</B></FONT> 
<P>The assumptions on which this scenario is based are that:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>1997 UN population projections apply; 
  <LI>no further development of water resources is anticipated; 
  <LI>total water demand is estimated based on the criteria given in box 1; 
  <LI>security of water for domestic and industrial use is assumed as a first 
  priority; and 
  <LI>agricultural productivity per unit of water is assumed to improve, 
  achieving a 17 per cent saving in agricultural water demand by 2015. </LI></UL>
<P>Under this scenario, the Arabian Peninsula will suffer from acute water 
shortages and fail to fulfil the set policy of maximum possible food 
self-sufficiency. Water balance will remain in deficit throughout the period, 
with the percentage water demand deficit varying from 47.9 per cent in 1995 to 
67.4 per cent in 2015. A total water deficit of some 31&nbsp;910 million cubic 
metres in 2015 is foreseen.</P>
<P>The Mashriq sub-region is better off. The water balance will continue on the 
positive side. However, the percentage of surplus of water in relation to demand 
will come down from 31.9 per cent in 1995 to a critical 2.5 per cent in 
2015.</P>
<P>For West Asia as a whole, this scenario suggests a deficit of 4&nbsp;110 
million cubic metres in 2005, rising to 29&nbsp;440 million cubic metres in 
2015. The percentage ratio between water balance and total demand will swing 
from +18.4 per cent in 1995 to -20.55 per cent in 2015 (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table7.htm">table 7</A>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, these disturbing conclusions assume that disputes over shared 
water resources will be settled and agricultural water demand will decrease. 
This anticipated reduction in agricultural water demand of 17 per cent by 2015 
(box 1) will come from agricultural research to maximise agricultural 
productivity per unit of water and the application of appropriate technologies, 
including biotechnologies, to achieve this.</P>
<P>Although scenario 1 appears pessimistic, maybe even unrealistic, there are 
several justifications for its consideration. West Asia is located in an arid 
region; 80 per cent of its land is classified as desert or semi-desert. Most of 
the easily exploited or promising water sources have been developed; remaining 
locations require heavy investment, laborious investigation and intensive 
research programmes.</P>
<P>The unresolved political conflicts and the disputes and wars that have 
inflamed the region in the last three decades have drastically affected the 
region's economy and upset the socio-economic development plans of all member 
countries. Potential conflicts over shared water resources - which constitute a 
significant proportion of total resources - require lengthy and difficult 
negotiation before equitable reconciliation can be attained. The result has been 
the postponement of many water development schemes.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Scenario 2: Supply Augmentation</B></FONT> 
<P>The assumptions on which this scenario is based are that:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the assumptions for population growth, water consumption rates, domestic 
  and industrial water use and policies of food self sufficiency projected in 
  scenario 1 apply; 
  <LI>intensive research into developing conventional and non-conventional water 
  sources will increase surface and groundwater resources in the Arabian 
  Peninsula and the Mashriq by 100 million cubic metres a year, giving a total 
  increase of 4&nbsp;000 million cubic metres by 2015 (2&nbsp;000 million cubic 
  metres for each sub-region); 
  <LI>desalination capacity will increase to 3&nbsp;000 million cubic metres a 
  year in the Arabian Peninsula; and 
  <LI>wastewater recycling will increase to 3&nbsp;000 million cubic metres a 
  year in the Arabian Peninsula and 2&nbsp;000 million cubic metres a year in 
  the Mashriq. </LI></UL>
<P>Under the supply augmentation scenario, the water deficit in the Arabian 
Peninsula will be reduced to 26&nbsp;470 million cubic metres by 2015; the 
percentage water demand deficit will increase from 47.9 per cent in 1995 to 55.9 
per cent in 2015.</P>
<P>In the Mashriq, while there will be no overall deficit in water resources, 
the percentage ratio between water balance and total demand will decrease from 
47.9 per cent in 1995 to 6.5 per cent in 2015.</P>
<P>For West Asia as a whole, there will be a deficit of 9&nbsp;380 million cubic 
metres in 2010 reaching 20 240 million cubic metres in 2015. The percentage 
ratio between water balance and total demand will drop from +18.4 per cent in 
1995 to -14.1 per cent in 2015 (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table8.htm">table 8</A>).</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Scenario 3: Supply Augmentation and Policy 
Remedies</B></FONT> 
<P>The assumptions on which this scenario is based are that:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the assumptions of scenarios 1 and 2 apply; and 
  <LI>a further gradual, rational decrease in consumption patterns outlined in 
  scenarios 1 and 2 is achieved by increasing the efficiency of irrigation, 
  reviewing the price of water and improving wastewater management. </LI></UL>
<P>Under this scenario, extensive research, investigation, development and 
reform programmes will be essential to develop the additional water resources 
foreseen in scenario 2, to effect the optimum rationalisation of water use and 
to minimise water losses to gain about 11 600 million cubic metres by 2015. This 
will be achieved by resolving the major snags and problems that impede the 
efficient use of the limited available water resources (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table10.htm">table 10</A>).</P>
<P>Even with supply augmentation and policy remedies, the Arabian Peninsula will 
continue to experience an increasing water deficit, from 14 160 million cubic 
metres in 1995 to 20&nbsp;870 million cubic metres in 2015. The percentage ratio 
between water balance and total demand will level off at around -50 per 
cent.</P>
<P>Under the same scenario, the Mashriq will continue to enjoy a surplus of 
water resources, varying between 31 850 million cubic metres in 1995 to 12 230 
million cubic metres in 2015. Nevertheless, the percentage of water balance to 
total demand will decrease from 47.9 per cent in 1995 to 13.6 per cent by 
2015.</P>
<P>The result of adding policy remedies to the supply augmentation scenario 
should result, by 2015, in a decrease in total water demand of 6&nbsp;000 
million cubic metres for the Mashriq and 5 600 million cubic metres for the 
Arabian Peninsula.</P>
<P>For West Asia as a whole, a deficit of 500 million cubic metres in water 
resources will be experienced in 2010 rising to 8, 640 million cubic metres in 
2015. The percentage of water balance to demand will gradually fall to -6.6 per 
cent in 2015 (<A href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/table9.htm">table 
9</A>). </P>
<P>It is evident that scenario 3 is preferable and constitutes an appropriate 
basis for defining an alternative strategy for securing the sustainable 
development of water resources in West Asia. Even so, it is clear that the 
Arabian Peninsula will continue to experience a deficit in its water resources 
if its food security targets are adhered to. Either the sub-region will have to 
mine some 361&nbsp;700 million cubic metres of shallow and deep groundwater 
resources during the projected period, or it will have to significantly increase 
imports of agricultural produce to cover the deficit. In the Mashriq, the early 
equitable settlement of potential conflicts over shared water resources remains 
a fundamental pressing issue.</P>

    </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The overall objectives of the following proposed alternative water policies 
for the countries of West Asia is to secure long-term water supplies while 
meeting strict criteria for public health requirements and for socio-economic, 
financial and environmental sustainability. The actions set out below are based 
primarily on the lessons from scenario 3, and seem to offer the most promising 
alternatives. They are focused specifically on the acute problems of water 
supply and management in the West Asia region, and are aimed to encourage:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the appropriate development of conventional and non-conventional water 
  resources; 
  <LI>the resolution of conflicts over shared water resources; 
  <LI>a marked improvement in the efficiency of water use; and 
  <LI>a substantial decrease in water demand. </LI></UL>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Planning and Analysis</B></FONT> 
<P>Water policy formulation is very data intensive. Reliable data are the basis 
for the sound planning and implementation of water policy. Comprehensive 
hydrological data are required to complete a full inventory of the existing 
quantity and quality of water resources, along with time series for trend 
analysis and to calculate design parameters for waterworks. Data should be 
scrutinised to eliminate any exaggeration, and data collection should be well 
planned and continuous to provide information for assessing the performance of 
water schemes after implementation and their effect on downstream users.</P>
<P>The scarcity of water resources in West Asia is aggravated by potential 
conflicts between member countries and their neighbours; these will seriously 
affect the preparation of future sustainable socio-economic development plans if 
not reconciled. The development of additional water resources in the region will 
require well planned, detailed and integrated studies of the potential for 
surface, groundwater and non-conventional water resources, and cooperation 
between member states in these studies. Only then can the most appropriate and 
economically feasible options be selected from among the many recognised 
techniques, including rainwater harvesting, surface storage, groundwater 
recharge, wastewater reuse, weather modification, rational exploitation of 
groundwater aquifers, water importation and desalination of brackish and sea 
water.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Legal and Institutional Reforms</B></FONT> 
<P>Water legislation is closely linked with the development of other natural 
resources, especially in arid regions such as West Asia where environmental 
conditions are vulnerable and sensitive to deterioration. Water legislation in 
West Asia is not keeping pace with the demand for water resources and there is 
an urgent need to critically review all existing legislation and how it relates 
to the policy options under review. The main areas of legislation that require 
amendment cover water rights, water abstraction, water quality and environmental 
standards, water charges, water pollution and environment protection, 
groundwater protection from depletion and contamination, wastewater treatment 
and solid waste disposal.</P>
<P>Amended legislation itself will not be effective in implementing new policy 
without a significant reorganisation of water administrations, and especially 
the decentralisation of the power and influence of the central governmental 
bodies responsible for water resource development and management. Indeed, 
institutional weakness constitutes a major constraint on the management of water 
resources in most of the countries of West Asia. This is a direct consequence of 
the institutions dealing with water research having ill-defined responsibilities 
regarding investigation and studies, planning and management, and the absence of 
updated powerful legislation to enforce coordination and collaboration between 
different authorities at local, regional and national levels. Cross-sectoral 
coordination between the water, agriculture, housing, industry, and planning 
directorates of governments is also required for efficient and successful policy 
formulation. Capacity building among the technical staff of research institutes 
and other water and agricultural administrations is also badly needed.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Economic Considerations</B></FONT> 
<P>There are strong links between national economies and water resource 
management. National development strategies - for example strategies for food 
self-sufficiency - directly influence water allocation and use, while policies 
to promote exports and foreign exchange earnings from highly priced cash crops 
call for increased investment in irrigation schemes.</P>
<P>The implementation of effective and efficient policies governing water 
resources is greatly hindered by the shortage of financial resources. Future 
sustainable water policies must have positive impacts on central government 
finances from new tax revenues, prices and charges, and the reduction of 
subsidies.</P>
<P>Economic incentives could provide effective instruments for rationalising 
water use provided they do not act against other key economic factors. Possible 
incentives include water tariffs for domestic and industrial water supplies, 
charges for abstraction, irrigation, water wastage and pollution, and soft loans 
for modernising equipment. While the best way of discouraging industrial water 
pollution may be by setting economic charges for water polluters with pollution 
charges proportional to the volume and the quality of effluent, implementation 
difficulties may be encountered through lack of enforcement procedures. The same 
caveat also applies for irrigation charges, based on metering consumption, area 
irrigated, type of crop, or length of irrigation time.</P>
<P>Groundwater pricing can be based either on quantity-based charges or on 
transferable pumping entitlements. Existing problems with monitoring and 
enforcement suggest that a quantity-based approach is both economically and 
administratively efficient (<A 
href="http://www.grida.no/geo2000/aps-wasia/index.htm#fao1993" 
onclick="showRef('fao1993'); return false;">FAO 1993</A>) even though it may not 
be the most effective alternative.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Water Conservation</B></FONT> 
<P>Records and studies indicate that water is used excessively and wastefully in 
all sectors - agricultural, domestic and industrial - throughout West Asia. Huge 
water losses of at least 45 per cent in agriculture arise from inefficient 
irrigation systems, there is a 20 per cent leakage rate from water supply 
networks, and 10 per cent losses are recorded for industrial use. All countries 
of West Asia must incorporate conservation programmes into their water resource 
management plans to cut down water losses.</P>
<P>In the agricultural sector this can be approached by:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Reviewing the economics of irrigation and agricultural production and 
  reappraising agricultural policies. 
  <LI>Improving the efficiency of traditional irrigation systems, introducing 
  appropriate modern irrigation technology and promoting water conservation 
  techniques among farmers and other water users. 
  <LI>Reviewing current irrigation incentives and tariffs, implementing the 
  necessary legislation to enforce and update regulations on water use and 
  strictly enforcing regulations. 
  <LI>Improving extension services and programmes for raising awareness among 
  farmers and the public about the economic value of water as a precious, scarce 
  and viable resource. 
  <LI>Providing subsidies or soft loans to encourage the application of modern 
  irrigation systems. </LI></UL>
<P>The domestic and industrial sectors may require:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Restructured water pricing to reflect the true costs, including 
  environmental costs, of maintaining and operating water supply works and 
  desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Water tariffs in most countries 
  of the Arabian Peninsula are too low to encourage rational water use. 
  <LI>A review of water pricing mechanisms and the application of escalating 
  tariffs for increasing water consumption. 
  <LI>The installation of modern water saving technology for distribution 
  systems and households. 
  <LI>Improved leakage detection in water supply networks. 
  <LI>Modified building codes to promote efficient use of wastewater for 
  landscaping. 
  <LI>The application of heavy pollution charges against industrial units 
  violating regulations. 
  <LI>The obligation for industrial units to treat water before recharging it 
  into water courses, lakes and other water bodies, and the sea. </LI></UL>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Projects and Programs</B></FONT> 
<P>Water projects and programmes represent the final outcome of the process of 
water policy review. They constitute a component of the action plan which should 
be consistent with overall water strategies. During detailed feasibility 
studies, any proposed projects and programmes must undergo comprehensive review 
and assessment before implementation, including cost-benefit analysis, 
cost-effectiveness analysis, environmental impact assessment and economic and 
financial analysis.</P>
<P>It is suggested that each country of West Asia appoint a national council, if 
not yet existing, whose members are ministers responsible for water resource 
development, management and utilisation, to coordinate at the highest political 
level and formulate the overall water policy of the country. A technical body 
(secretariat/committee), to be suggested by the council and composed of senior 
scientists, economists, engineers, lawyers from concerned ministries and 
authorities, university and research institutes, and public agencies and 
stakeholders, including (if the country's political system permits) 
representatives of water users, would help the council and ensure fair 
institutional and inter-ministerial coordination at the national level.</P>
<P>Any water strategy should consider water sector development, demand, 
protection and sustainable use in the medium and long term (15-30 years). A lot 
of data and information are needed to adequately form the base on which the 
strategy would be formulated, with possible suitable options. The work plan 
would include several stages, with a number of parameters relevant to each 
stage. These are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The collection and review of existing data and information. 
  <LI>The review and evaluation of previous development studies. 
  <LI>The review of current conditions of water resources, population growth, 
  socio-economic conditions, land use, water utilisation, and related 
  legislation in force. 
  <LI>The evaluation of the potential of water resources. 
  <LI>Forecasting water demand. 
  <LI>A water resources development planning framework. 
  <LI>The assessment of water resources management, institutional reform and 
  water facilities. 
  <LI>Rough estimates of total cost. 
  <LI>The evaluation of strategy formulation: financial, economic and social 
  analyses. </LI></UL>
<P>According to the evaluation result, the selected options and alternatives for 
strategy formulation could be decided and programmes, water projects, tariffs, 
new technologies and legal institutional reform could be recommended.</P>
<P>Water policies are usually projected over long periods and normally have 
unforeseen impacts which are difficult to measure in detail. They may not be 
implemented as proposed, instead responding to current needs and priorities. 
Water policies may require continuous monitoring for progress, re-evaluation or 
even revision of priorities to meet obstacles. Therefore, monitoring policy 
actions would benefit policy management.</P>
<P><FONT color=#002e96 size=+1><B>Conclusion</B></FONT> 
<P>The successful implementation of these policies is the key to coping with 
water scarcity in the region. However, failure to achieve the set targets of 
decreasing agricultural water demand will result in the deterioration of both 
the quantity and quality of water supplies, widening food deficits, inflaming 
social unrest, and exacerbating possible regional conflicts. Furthermore, the 
assumptions built into the other scenarios will delay these problems, not solve 
them, unless stringent regulatory measures are put into force and policy shifts 
strictly implemented.</P>
