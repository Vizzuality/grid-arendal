      greatest challenge to the international community. Of special concern are 
      the 1.2 billion people living on less than $1 a day and the additional 1.6 
      billion living on less than $2 a day.
      <P>Setting goals to reduce poverty is an essential part of the way 
      forward. Building on the global United Nations conferences and summits of 
      the 1990s, the development goals described in this report are broad goals 
      for the entire world. They address some of the many dimensions of poverty 
      and its effects on people's lives. In accepting these goals, the 
      international community makes a commitment to the world's poorest and most 
      vulnerable—and to itself.</P>
      <P>The goals are set in precise terms—measured in numbers to ensure 
      accountability. The openness and transparency of such numbers can help us 
      chart a course to achieve the goals and track progress. But people are not 
      numbers—happiness is not a statistic. These goals are worthwhile because 
      they will improve the quality of human life. The world will be better, and 
      safer, for its 6 billion people and for the projected 7 billion people in 
      2015.</P>
      <P>Goals cannot be imposed—they must be embraced. Each country must 
      identify its own particular goals, its own path to development, and make 
      its own commitment through dialogue with its citizens. In this, the 
      support of the international community is vital. And the high-income 
      countries, because of their greater resources, have much to 
contribute.</P>
      <P>It is essential for all the partners in this development effort to 
      pursue faster, sustainable growth strategies that favour the poor. To 
      spend efficiently—avoiding waste and ensuring that the mechanisms for 
      accountability are always in place. To spend effectively—on activities 
      aimed at human, social and economic development, not on excessive military 
      capacity or on environmentally disastrous projects. And to spend 
      wisely—not committing public resources to activities that can be best 
      undertaken by the private sector.</P>
      <P>What are the obstacles? Weak governance. Bad policies. Human rights 
      abuses. Conflicts, natural disasters and other external shocks. The spread 
      of HIV/AIDS. The failure to address inequities in income, education and 
      access to health care, and the inequalities between men and women.</P>
      <P>But there is more. Limits on developing countries' access to global 
      markets, the burden of debt, the decline in development aid and, 
      sometimes, inconsistencies in donor policies also hinder faster 
      progress.</P>
      <P>What will it take to overcome these obstacles? True partnership—and a 
      continuing commitment to eliminate poverty in its many dimensions. Our 
      institutions are actively using these development goals as a common 
      framework to guide our policies and programmes and to assess our 
      effectiveness. We cannot afford to lose the fight against poverty. And we 
      must be unshakeable in our unified desire to win that fight—for 
      everyone.</P>
