<DIV align=center><BR></DIV><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>NAIROBI, October 26, 
2000</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>&#8212;The World Bank has approved a US$72 
million credit to assist Kenya in alleviating severe power shortages that have 
devastated its economy. The </FONT><I><FONT face=Arial size=2>Kenya Emergency 
Power Supply Project</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial size=2> will support contracts 
for supply of 105 MW of emergency power which is needed to bridge a prolonged 
shortfall in energy supply from conventional sources. The credit will be used to 
finance electric power purchases from three independent power producers who have 
been contracted by the Government of Kenya. It will also finance the fuel costs 
of these emergency plants and facilitate supply of incremental fuel to Kenya 
Electricity Generating Company's thermal power generation 
plants.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><I><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Emergency Power Supply Credit</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial size=2> is the 
third credit for Kenya to be approved by the World Bank during the current 
fiscal year. Other projects approved are the US$150 million Economic Public 
Sector Reform Credit to help improve economic growth and reduce poverty and the 
US$50 million credit for a Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><I><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Emergency Power Supply Credit</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial size=2> will 
benefit Kenyans by restoring economic activity, job levels and incomes, and also 
facilitate measures that will improve the overall efficiency of the energy 
sector to stop recurrence of an energy crisis similar to the one the country has 
experienced in recent years.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 
</FONT><I><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT></I><FONT face=Arial size=2>credit was 
considered on an exceptional basis after the Government appealed to the World 
Bank, the IMF and other donors to assist Kenya in addressing the impact of 
prolonged drought on the economy. Kenya has experienced severe drought for over 
two years due to failure and poor distribution of rains in the main water 
catchment areas, which are also the source of water flows to hydro power 
generating facilities. This has necessitated severe power rationing to 
industrial and domestic consumers. An assessment by the Government and the 
donors estimates the economic losses arising from power rationing to US$2 
million a day. It is also estimated that by the onset of long rains in April 
next year, the economic costs of unmet electricity demand will amount to 
US$400-630 million, equivalent to 3.8-6.5 percent of GDP. Restoring power 
supplies to near normal levels is therefore critical to reversing the decline in 
the economy, which has resulted in substantial job and income losses that have 
particularly hurt the poor sections of the population.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>In approving the credit, the Board considered the effort the 
Government is making, under a difficult economic environment, towards reforms in 
key areas, including the energy sector. Last week, the Government issued a 
public statement on the restructuring of Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) 
as part of the continuing overall restructuring of the energy sector under the 
Bank-funded Energy Sector Reform and Power Development Project which started 
three years ago. The statement addressed concerns about the pace of reforms in 
the sector and commitments to increased efficiency that have been raised during 
the term of the project. The Government has established a broad based Emergency 
Electricity Coordination Committee (EECC) to initiate and oversee the 
restructuring process of improving the operations and financial management of 
KPLC. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>In a remarkable managerial effort, 
the emergency power generating capacity to be financed by the credit has already 
been installed, and is making major contributions to the reduction of power 
shortages already.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The project will be 
financed by a US$72 million credit from the International Development 
Association (IDA), the World Bank's lending arm for the poorest countries. This 
IDA credit is on standard terms of 40 years maturity, including 10 years 
grace.</FONT><BR>
