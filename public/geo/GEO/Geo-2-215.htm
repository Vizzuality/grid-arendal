    <TD><FONT face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=2>Curitiba has become 
      a model for developed and developing countries alike. Cassio Taniguchi 
      describes its pioneering public transport system 
      <P align=left>The value of a city is directly proportional to the degree 
      of satisfaction of the people that live in it. So an urban administration 
      can be visibly and critically assessed by the quality of life of the 
      inhabitants. When it makes decisions, it should always keep its citizens 
      in the spotlight. 
      <P align=left>For this reason, successive municipal administrations in 
      Curitiba since the beginning of the 1970s have done their best to answer &#8211; 
      in a practical and organized way &#8211; this basic question: how can the city 
      welcome an ever increasing number of inhabitants into a static physical 
      space, without losing quality of life? 
      <P align=left>Public administrators must preserve the environment while 
      meeting the demands of an urban centre and planning the sustainable 
      development of a city. In Curitiba, transport proved to be the key to a 
      sustainable future. Its urban transport system was set up to give its 
      citizens high-quality service as standard. Harmonized with the city&#8217;s 
      plans and zoning regulations, it transformed the emptiness of the 1970s 
      into residential and business areas &#8211; and induced the desired growth. 
      <P align=left>Following the principle of respecting the citizens, the 
      Research and Urban Planning Institute of Curitiba designed special buses 
      in 1973 in partnership with transport enterprises and automobile 
      manufacturers. These replaced trucks adapted for mass transportation which 
      did not offer the comfort or safety their users deserved. The new buses 
      had larger doorways, a lowered chassis, wide windows, special ventilation 
      systems and rear-located engines, all to provide passengers with greater 
      comfort. 
      <P align=left>The city&#8217;s mass transportation system, which was established 
      in the following year, was the first in Brazil to use bus lanes alongside 
      the system for private cars. People left their cars at home, finding mass 
      transportation very competitive because of its speed, punctuality and 
      regularity. 
      <P align=left>As the system evolved, larger buses were designed and built 
      &#8211; including articulated ones in the 1980s, carrying up to 160 people, and 
      bi-articulated ones in the 1990s each with a capacity of 270 passengers. 
      Vehicles with automatic transmissions and air suspension were introduced, 
      as was a system of paying fares in advance so as to make boarding more 
      efficient. <BR>

      people now use the city&#8217;s integrated transit network every day. It has 
      four elements: the direct line; an alternative &#8216;speedy&#8217; system &#8211; buses 
      which travel faster and have fewer stops; the inter-district line, which 
      carries out trips between districts without crossing the centre of the 
      city; and feeder buses, which connect terminals to the districts. It is 
      integrated within the 12 municipalities of the metropolitan region, and is 
      continually updated as the city and its population grow. 
      <P align=left>Public transportation also plays a fundamental role in 
      preserving the environment. A high-quality transport system, accessible to 
      the citizens, reduces the number of vehicles circulating around the city 
      and, as a result, cuts the level of air pollution. <BR><BR><B>Taking the 
      lead</B> <BR>Curitiba took a pioneering step to improve air quality even 
      further by becoming the first city in Brazil to use less polluting fuels. 
      We have adopted a special fuel made up of 89.4 per cent diesel, 8 per cent 
      anhydrous alcohol and 2.6 per cent soybean additive. The resulting fuel is 
      less polluting and cuts the emissions of particles to the air by up to 43 
      per cent. Adding the mixture of alcohol and soybean additive to the diesel 
      also brings social and economic benefits, including maintaining employment 
      in rural areas, as every billion litres of alcohol generate approximately 
      50,000 new jobs. 
      <P align=left>Curitiba is now issuing a smart card to replace cash in 
      paying fares, thereby increase the security for passengers using the mass 
      transportation system. Citizens registered at the City Hall will be given 
      access to the card, which is made up of available credits. People who are 
      exempt from paying fares &#8211; such as the elderly, physically handicapped, 
      police officers and students &#8211; will also have the right to a card. 
      <P align=left>At City Hall, we work to enable the inhabitants of Curitiba 
      to participate in all decision-making processes, so they can see the city 
      as an extension of their own homes. We do not intend to leave icons or 
      concrete memorials as legacies, but social action revives a feeling of 
      citizenship and bring benefits to all without distinction <IMG height=6
