      <P>This publication contains information about the health risks posed by 
      ultraviolet (<A href="http://www.epa.gov/ozone/defns.html#uvb">UV</A>) 
      radiation and describes the steps people can take to protect themselves 
      from overexposure to the sun. This information is designed to help 
      meteorologists when they broadcast a UV Index report. 
      <P>In 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 
      National Weather Service (<A href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/">NWS</A>) 
      introduced the UV Index as a daily report on the UV radiation levels 
      people may experience. The Index predicts the next day's levels on a 0 to 
      10+ scale. 
      <P>This information contains both general sun safety tips as well as 
      specific health advisories for each UV Index level. These tips and 
      advisories are the product of close cooperation between EPA,NWS, the <A 
      href="http://www.aad.org/">American Academy of Dermatology</A>, the <A 
      href="http://www.ametsoc.org/">American Meteorological Society</A>, and 
      representatives of the broadcast meteorology community who actively 
      broadcast weather information to the public.

      <H3>WHY WORRY ABOUT TOO MUCH SUN?</H3>UV radiation from the sun can 
      seriously threaten human health.

          <TH bgColor=#ffdddd>Sunburn</TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The most obvious 
      result of too much sun is sunburn, which involves skin redness and 
      sometimes tenderness, swelling, blistering, fever, and nausea. Although 
      some skin types prevent individuals from burning, everyone is at risk for 
      other UV-related health effects.

        <TR>
          <TH bgColor=#ffdddd>Premature wrinkling</TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE>In the 
      long run, too much exposure to the sun can change your skin's texture, 
      giving it a tough, leathery appearance. The sun also can cause 
      discolorations in skin tone including red, yellow, gray, or brown spots.

          <TH bgColor=#ffdddd>Skin cancer</TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Over time, 
      exposure to the sun and severe sunburns can lead to skin cancer. The most 
      common places for skin cancer to develop are on those body parts exposed 
      to the sun such as the face, neck, ears, forearms, and hands. 
      <P>The three main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous 
      cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. 
      <UL>
        <LI>Basal cell carcinomas are tumors that usually appear as small, 
        fleshy bumps or nodules. 
        <LI>Squamous cell carcinomas appear as nodules or as red, scaly patches. 

        <LI>Malignant melanomas may appear without warning as a dark mole or 
        other dark spot in the skin. </LI></UL>
      <P>All three types can be curable if you detect them in their early 
      stages. To help recognize potential problems, conduct periodic 
      self-examinations and watch for growths that meet one of the 'ABCDs' of 
      melanoma.

      to help educate your viewers about how they can avoid overexposure to the 
      sun on any day. The remainder of the booklet contains messages that apply 
      directly to each UV Index level. 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT size=+1>Minimize exposure</FONT> to the sun during the hours 
        when exposure could be most damaging, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Typically, 
        exposure at 8 a.m. or 4 p.m. is only one third that at midday. Try 
        getting outdoor activities accomplished during minimum exposure hours. 
        Remember, however, you can still get a sunburn even in the 
        mid-afternoon. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><FONT size=+1>Remember that incidental time in the sun can add 
        up</FONT> to long-term sun damage, including the time spent walking the 
        dog, window shopping, performing outdoor chores, or jogging at lunch. 
        Even on overcast days, 30 to 60 percent of the sun's rays can penetrate 
        to the Earth's surface. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><FONT size=+1>Wear a hat</FONT> and other protective clothing, as 
        well as sunglasses, to protect your body from too much sun. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><FONT size=+1>Use 'broad spectrum sunscreens,'</FONT> which are 
        those that contain active ingredients that absorb at least 85 percent of 
        the UVA and UVB rays of the sun. Read labels carefully and choose a 
        broad spectrum sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 
        15, which filters out both UVA and UVB radiation. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><FONT size=+1>Apply sunscreen liberally</FONT> to all exposed skin, 
        about 20 minutes before exposure, especially to easily overlooked areas 
        like the rims of the ears, the back of the neck, and the tops of the 
        feet. For an average adult, the recommended dose is 1 ounce, or one 
        quarter of a 4-ounce bottle, per application. Reapply every 2 hours, 
        after being in the water, or after exercising and sweating.

      <H3>USING THE UV INDEX</H3>The UV Index can help the public be aware of 
      the level of UV radiation exposure expected on a given day. As a result, 
      people can use simple sun protective behaviors to reduce their lifetime 
      risk of developing skin cancer and other sun-related illnesses. What 
      follows is a description of each UV Index level and tips you can give to 
      help people prepare.

            unprotected sun exposure. Fair-skinned people might burn in less 
            than 15 minutes. Apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Wear

            a.m. to 4 p.m. Protect yourself by liberally applying a sunscreen

            vacationers who can receive very intense sun exposure. Minimize sun 
            exposure during midday hours, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen

              <LI>Wear sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of all UV rays 
              (both UVA and UVB). Some reduction in blue light also might be 
              beneficial but colors should not be severely distorted. 
              <LI>Wear a cap or hat with a wide brim, which will block roughly 
              50 percent of UV radiation from reaching the eyes. Wearing 
              sunglasses as well can block the remainder of UV rays. 
            </LI></UL><B>Beat the Heat</B><BR>If possible, stay indoors on days 
            when the UV Index is very high. Take the opportunity to relax with a 
            good book rather than risk dangerous levels of sun exposure. Try not
