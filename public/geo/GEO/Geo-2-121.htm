                  SUMMARY</B></A> 
                  <OL class=clsTextItem>
                    <LI>The assessment by this report shows that in many 
                    countries, both developing and developed, current pathways 
                    for water use are often not sustainable. There is clear and 
                    convincing evidence that the world faces a worsening series 
                    of local and regional water quantity and quality problems, 
                    largely as a result of poor water allocation, wasteful use 
                    of the resource, and lack of adequate management action. 
                    Water resources constraints and water degradation are 
                    weakening one of the resource bases on which human society 
                    is built. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water use has been growing at more than twice the rate 
                    of the population increase during this century, and already 
                    a number of regions are chronically water short. About 
                    one-third of the world's population lives in countries that 
                    are experiencing moderate to high water stress partly 
                    resulting from increasing demands from a growing population 
                    and human activities. By 2025, as much as 2/3 of the world 
                    population would be under stress conditions. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water shortages and pollution are causing widespread 
                    public health problems, limiting economic and agricultural 
                    development, and harming a wide range of ecosystems. They 
                    may put global food supplies in jeopardy, and lead to 
                    economic stagnation in many areas of the world. The result 
                    could be a series of local and regional water crises with 
                    global implications. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>This report finds that in some cases people have taken 
                    action to reduce demand and pollution, thus relieving water 
                    stress. However, far more widespread and sustained action is 
                    essential to reverse many of the unsustainable trends. This 
                    report presents policy options designed to improve 
                    understanding of how to reach sustainable levels of water 
                    use, while satisfying a wide range of needs including 
                    agricultural irrigation, industrial development, domestic 
                    use and water to maintain natural ecosystems. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>Among the findings of this report: 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>There is a steady increase in the number of regions of 
                    the world where human demands are outstripping local water 
                    supplies, and the resulting water stress is limiting the 
                    development, especially of poor societies. Due largely to 
                    poverty, at least one-fifth of all people do not have access 
                    to safe drinking water, and more than one-half of humanity 
                    lacks adequate sanitation. At any given time, an estimated 
                    one-half of the people in developing countries suffer from 
                    water and food related diseases caused either directly by 
                    infection, or indirectly by disease-carrying organisms that 
                    breed in water and food. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water demands are so high that a number of large rivers 
                    decrease in volume as they flow downstream, with the result 
                    that downstream users face shortages, and ecosystems suffer, 
                    both in the rivers and in adjacent coastal areas. Many 
                    underground water resources, known as groundwater, are being 
                    drained faster than nature can replenish them. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>A growing number of the world's rivers, lakes and 
                    groundwater aquifers are being severely contaminated by 
                    human, industrial and agricultural wastes. The pollution not 
                    only affects freshwater quality, but much of it flows into 
                    the world's oceans, threatening marine life. The future 
                    health of the oceans depends heavily on how the freshwater 
                    systems are managed. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>High withdrawals of water, and the heavy pollution loads 
                    have already caused widespread harm to a number of 
                    ecosystems. This has resulted in a wide range of health 
                    effects, in which humans have been harmed by eating food 
                    from contaminated ecosystems. Reproductive failures and 
                    death in various wildlife species, particularly at higher 
                    levels in the food chain are being reported in various 
                    regions of the world. In addition, rising human demands will 
                    put increasing pressure on ecosystems. As more water is 
                    withdrawn for human uses, there is increasing need to make 
                    certain that an adequate water supply to wetlands, lakes, 
                    rivers and coastal areas are maintained to ensure the 
                    healthy functioning of ecosystems. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>However, there are bright spots to note. There have been 
                    some significant improvements in water quality, particularly 
                    when citizen pressure for cleanups grew, and governments and 
                    industry responded. Most developed countries have begun 
                    treating an increasing part of their municipal sewage, and a 
                    number of their industries are reducing discharges of many 
                    toxic substances. As a result, there have been improvements 
                    in the health of some wildlife species, and reduced risks to 
                    human health. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Some countries have also made impressive reductions in 
                    the amount of water needed for irrigation, industrial and 
                    municipal purposes by using more effective water management 
                    systems and better technologies. These improvements were 
                    usually driven by shortages, and by increases in the price 
                    of water. Improved irrigation water management leads to less 
                    seepage and pooling of water which have a favourable impact 
                    on the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as malaria 
                    and schistosomiasis. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>On balance, these gains have not reversed either the 
                    general trend toward water shortages, nor the widespread 
                    decline in water quality. A number of studies by UN agencies 
                    show that many countries lack the capacity to do 
                    comprehensive water resources assessments that include not 
                    only water quantity and quality but other factors such as 
                    changes in population and industrial development. There is a 
                    need for countries to strengthen their capabilities in this 
                    regard in order to be able to meet more effectively current 
                    and future stresses on their water resources. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>There are driving forces of change that could make water 
                    problems worse, unless actions are taken. Those forces 
                    include a world population that is now 5.7 billion, and is 
                    heading toward 8.3 billion by 2025. Much of this increase 
                    will be in the rapidly growing urban areas of developing 
                    countries, many of which are already experiencing serious 
                    water stress. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Another driving force will be increasing consumption of 
                    food and industrial goods produced using water. Irrigation 
                    already accounts for 70 per cent of the water taken from 
                    lakes, rivers and underground sources, and there will be 
                    pressure to use more water to produce food for the 
                    increasing population. An increasing number of water short 
                    countries will have to make choices about the amount of 
                    water they allocate for food production as compared to other 
                    uses. They may find that limited water resources are more 
                    profitably invested in producing goods that can be exported 
                    to buy food, rather than in trying to grow all their food at 
                    home. Countries will also face increasing demands for water 
                    supplies for industrial development, hydro-electric 
                    generation, navigation, recreation and domestic use. Unless 
                    development stays within the limits of water supplies, there 
                    could be shortages that hamper economic development.

                    <LI>Water pollution will continue to increase unless more 
                    effort is put into pollution prevention, increase sewage 
                    treatment, and employ cleaner and more water-efficient forms 
                    of industrial production. This means using substances that 
                    are less toxic, and reducing the release into the 
                    environment of potentially harmful materials that are used 
                    in agriculture, industry and homes. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Because of increasing competition among demands for a 
                    finite resource, there is already growing perception of 
                    water as an economic good and as a tradable commodity. As 
                    human demands grow, so will the price of water and possibly 
                    food prices, placing a heavier burden on the poorer strata 
                    of the worldþs population. Economic planners often neglect 
                    to account for the amount of water that will be needed for 
                    certain forms of development, especially food production, 
                    for the world of 2025. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Countries, often working in regional groups and with 
                    international institutions such as the United Nations, need 
                    to develop a broad range of water strategies based on the 
                    best information available. There is a need to use water 
                    more efficiently, reduce pollution, provide people with 
                    access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and work for a 
                    global trading system in which countries that lack enough 
                    water to grow all their own food will have access to food 
                    grown in water rich regions. Concerted actions are needed at 
                    the local, national and international level. These include 
                    incorporating water into economic analyses, which should 
                    change consumption patterns and reduce demand for water. 
                    Poverty alleviation will be closely linked to the success of 
                    water policies. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>About 300 major river basins, and many groundwater 
                    aquifers cross national boundaries. It is essential for 
                    riparian countries to find ways of cooperating over the 
                    development and management of these transboundary water 
                    sources, if they are to maximize mutual benefits from the 
                    use of the resource. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>There are many technologies to reduce water use. In some 
                    countries, waste water is already being treated and used for 
                    irrigation. A number of industries have developed or adopted 
                    water management techniques and technologies that greatly 
                    reduce water use. Irrigation can become much more efficient 
                    in delivering water directly to plants, and still be 
                    designed and maintained in a way that avoids or minimizes 
                    such harmful side effects as waterlogging and salinization 
                    of the soil. Changing to crops using less water together 
                    with sequencing and shifting growing seasons can as well 
                    reduce water use substantially. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The amounts of water available and its quality are 
                    directly related to such activities as forestry, farming, 
                    urban developments and industrial strategies. To make water 
                    use more sustainable, planners at all levels need to 
                    understand water issues, and make them a central part of 
                    their development plans. The wise management of both water 
                    quantity and quality has to be a central part of health, 
                    economic and social policies. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water management must adopt an integrated approach, 
                    taking into account a wide range of ecological, economic and 
                    social factors and needs. Decision-making should include 
                    full public participation, with all sectors of society. In 
                    developing countries, women are the main providers of water 
                    for household uses, which makes it critical to involve them 
                    at all levels in the decision-making process. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>In making decisions about water resources management it 
                    is important to have overall planning and coordination, but 
                    it is also helpful to delegate as much responsibility as 
                    possible to the lowest appropriate levels. This helps to 
                    ensure participation of more people with a stake in the 
                    success of water projects. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water used for development should be considered as 
                    natural capital, an economic good, and the marketplace can 
                    help to decide where its services are best used to generate 
                    wealth. It is important to ensure that the way in which 
                    water resources are developed does not result in worsening 
                    poverty. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Because of the lengthy period of planning, design, and 
                    construction of large water resources projects, it is 
                    crucial for decision makers to start making plans based on 
                    the best evidence available. It is no exaggeration to say 
                    that water resources projects to meet the needs of societies 
                    and economies in 2025 must be started or be in an advanced 
                    planning stage within the next few years. It is essential to 
                    plan and design new projects in ways that avoid the past 
                    mistakes that resulted in excessive water use and degraded 
                    water quality. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The world faces many challenges over use of the 
                    environment as a source of natural resources and as a sink 
                    for wastes. Water has to be considered one of the main 
                    issues facing the world. It is as important as atmospheric 
                    change, deforestation, protection of biodiversity and 
                    desertification, all of which are linked to water 
                    management. Many of the negative trends will take years to 
                    reverse, so it is imperative that actions to reverse them 
                    begin immediately. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>All people require access to adequate amounts of clean 
                    water, for such basic needs as drinking, sanitation and 
                    hygiene. In return, those who use water have a 
                    responsibility to see that water is used wisely and not 
                    degraded. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>It will be vital to monitor and report on progress in

                    <LI>A growing number of regions face increasing water 
                    stresses because more people are both polluting and 
                    demanding more water for all uses from a renewable but 
                    finite resource. They are thus suffering from scarcities 
                    caused by failure to adapt to the amount of water that is 
                    regularly made available by rain and snowfall. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Concern over the global implications of water problems 
                    was voiced as far back as the United Nations Conference on 
                    the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. It has been the 
                    focus of a number of meetings, including the United Nations 
                    Water Conference in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1977, the 
                    Global Consultation on Safe Water and Sanitation for the 
                    1990s in New Delhi, India, 1990, the International 
                    Conference on Water and the Environment: Development Issues 
                    for the 21st Century, in Dublin, Ireland, and the United 
                    Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de 
                    Janeiro, Brazil, both in 1992. Since then, the 
                    Interministerial Conference on Drinking Water Supply and 
                    Environmental Sanitation, in Noordwijk, The Netherlands, in 
                    1994, reinforced these concerns. Most recently, the 
                    Committee on Natural Resources of the Economic and Social 
                    Council þnoted with alarm that some 80 countries, comprising 
                    40 per cent of the worldþs population, are already suffering 
                    from serious water shortages and that, in many cases, the 
                    scarcity of water resources has become the limiting factor 
                    to economic and social developmentþ. It further noted that 
                    þever- increasing water pollution has become a major problem 
                    throughout the world, including coastal zonesþ. The UN 
                    Commission on Sustainable Development, at its second session 
                    in 1994, noted that in many countries a rapid deterioration 
                    of water quality, serious water shortages and reduced 
                    availability of fresh water were severely affecting human 
                    health, ecosystems and economic development. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The Commission requested this Comprehensive Assessment 
                    of the Freshwater Resources of the World, to be submitted at 
                    its fifth session, and to the Special Session of the General 
                    Assembly in 1997. This assessment was prepared by a number 
                    of UN organizations, the Department of Policy Coordination 
                    and Sustainable Development, Department of Development 
                    Support and Management Services, Food and Agriculture

                    Organization, working in collaboration with the Stockholm 
                    Environment Institute, and with the advice of experts on a 
                    wide range of subjects. The support given to this project by 
                    the Governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands 
                    and Canada is acknowledged with sincere appreciation.

                    <LI>The recommendations in this report were guided by 
                    reports from previous conferences, particularly the report 
                    of the Dublin water conference and Chapter 18 of Agenda 21. 
                    More recent information has also been evaluated,

                    understand the urgent need to deal with these issues before 
                    they become even more serious. In spite of its limitations, 
                    the available information provides the basis for a broad 
                    understanding of the problems facing various regions of the 
                    world, and of the nature and magnitude of the global 
                    implications of not dealing with these problems.

                    <LI>Many people have an image of the world as a blue planet, 
                    for 70 per cent of it is covered with water. The reality is 
                    that 97.5 per cent of all water on earth is salt water, 
                    leaving only 2.5 per cent as fresh water. Nearly 70 per cent 
                    of that fresh water is frozen in the icecaps of Antarctica 
                    and Greenland, and most of the remainder is present as soil 
                    moisture, or lies in deep underground aquifers as 
                    groundwater not accessible to human use. As a result, less 
                    than one per cent of the world's fresh water, or about 0.007 
                    per cent of all water on earth, is readily accessible for 
                    direct human uses. This is the water found in lakes, rivers, 
                    reservoirs and those underground sources that are shallow 
                    enough to be tapped at an affordable cost. Only this amount 
                    is regularly renewed by rain and snowfall, and is therefore 
                    available on a sustainable basis. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Much of the approximately 110,000 cubic kilometres of

                    evaporates back into the atmosphere, or is absorbed by 
                    plants. About 42,700 cubic kilometres of water that falls on 
                    earth flows through the world's rivers. (This is roughly the 
                    amount of water now stored in some of the world's largest 
                    lake systems combined: Lake Baikal in Russia, and Lake 
                    Tanganyika and Lake Victoria in Africa combined.) When the 
                    world's total river flow is divided by the world population 
                    of 1995, that amounts to an average of 7,300 cubic metres of 
                    water per person each year. Due to the growing world 
                    population, that is a drop of 37 per cent per person since 
                    1970.

                    has billions of people, so the per capita availability is 
                    the lowest of all the continents. The high per capita runoff 
                    in Australia/Oceania shows that despite the fact much of 
                    Australia is very dry, the population density is quite low, 
                    and there is very heavy rainfall in parts of the country, 
                    and on the Pacific islands. <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Fresh water resources are very unevenly distributed, 
                    ranging from the deserts, where almost no rain falls, to the 
                    most humid regions, which can receive several metres of 
                    rainfall a year. Most of the flow is in a limited number of 
                    rivers: the Amazon carries 16 per cent of global runoff, 
                    while the Congo-Zaire River basin carries one-third of the 
                    river flow in all of Africa. The arid and semi-arid zones of 
                    the world, which constitute 40 per cent of the land mass, 
                    have only 2 per cent of global runoff. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>36. Even in parts of the world with large river flows, 
                    there can be a great amount of variability in when and where 
                    the water is available. Most of the annual water flow may 
                    come as floods following snow-melt or heavy rains, and 
                    unless captured by reservoirs, it flows to the seas, 
                    sometimes causing seasonal flooding. Later in the year, the 
                    same areas may suffer droughts. Another major factor in the 
                    availability of water is the rate of evapotranspiration, the 
                    loss of water from land to atmosphere by evaporation from 
                    the soil and water surfaces, and transpiration from plants. 
                    For example, Sweden and Botswana receive about the same 
                    amount of precipitation each year, yet the climate in Sweden 
                    is humid, while that of Botswana is semiarid, because so 
                    much of its water is drawn up by the heat of the sun. One 
                    more important factor is that much of the world's accessible 
                    runoff occurs in areas far from human settlements, and water 
                    is very expensive to transport over long distances.

                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Experts have estimated the amount of the fresh water 
                    that is readily accessible for human use at about 9,000 
                    cubic kilometres a year. They add another 3,500 cubic 
                    kilometres of water that is captured and stored by dams and 
                    reservoirs. Harnessing the remaining water resource for 
                    human needs becomes increasingly costly, because of 
                    topography, distance and environmental impacts. Currently, 
                    humans are using about half the 12,500 cubic kilometres of 
                    water that is readily available. Given an expected 
                    population increase of about 50% in the next 50 years, 
                    coupled with expected increases in demand as a result of 
                    economic growth and life-style changes, this does not leave 
                    a great room for increased consumption. Water needs to be 
                    left in rivers to maintain healthy ecosystems, including 
                    fisheries. Recreation, navigation, and hydro power 
                    generation all require the preservation of adequate amount 
                    of water. When the global water picture is examined at a 
                    country level, some countries still have large amounts of 
                    water per capita, but others, however, are already facing 
                    serious difficulties. Future increases in demand due to 
                    population growth and increased economic activities will 
                    inevitably impinge further on the available water resources.

                    <LI>A number of human actions are changing the flow of water 
                    in parts of the world, including the building of dams and 
                    canals, the drainage of wetlands, and removal of forests and 
                    other plant cover. Trees and other plants modify the flow of 
                    water that falls on the land, consume water, and release 
                    some into the atmosphere, where it may result in more rain. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem><A

                    5.</A> In the hydrological cycle, the sun constantly 
                    evaporates water into the atmosphere, part of which is 
                    returned on land as rain and snow. Part of that 
                    precipitation is rapidly evaporated back into the 
                    atmosphere. Some drains into lakes and rivers to commence a 
                    journey back to the sea. Part infiltrates into the soil to 
                    become soil moisture or groundwater. Under natural 
                    conditions, the groundwater gradually works its way back 
                    into surface waters and makes up the main source of 
                    dependable river flow. Plants incorporate some of the soil 
                    moisture and groundwater into their tissues, and release 
                    some into the atmosphere in the process of transpiration. 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Humans interact with the hydrological cycle at many 
                    levels. We use surface water and groundwater. Pollution 
                    contaminates not only water on and beneath the ground, but 
                    it also changes the chemical composition of water in the 
                    atmosphere. Waste discharges from a wide range of sources, 
                    including motor vehicles, homes, offices and industries, as 
                    well as chemicals and animal wastes from agricultural 
                    production, create contaminated runoff, some of which seeps 
                    into groundwater. Changes in the landscape affect the 
                    run-off and quality of both surface water and groundwater. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Part of the water withdrawn from rivers, steams, lakes, 
                    reservoirs or groundwater is consumed and not later returned 
                    as available water. Such consumption includes water that 
                    plants use to build plant tissue or release into the air 
                    during evapotranspiration. It also includes water that 
                    evaporates from land or reservoirs, and water that is not 
                    returned to water sources from industrial production or 
                    community use. The major forms of water withdrawal and 
                    consumption are for agriculture, industry and domestic use. 
                    Most of the water withdrawn by industries and municipalities 
                    is used then returned to lakes and rivers or other 
                    watercourses, often degraded in quality. Water withdrawn for 
                    irrigation use is partly consumed in the process of crop 
                    production, and partly required to flush salts out of the 
                    soil. However, most irrigation is inefficient and about 60 
                    percent of the withdrawn water returns to the river basin 
                    and to groundwater. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>In addition to domestic and municipal water supply, 
                    irrigation of crops, production of energy, and industrial 
                    uses. Navigation and recreation also require that adequate 
                    flows be available in rivers, and that water levels be 
                    maintained in lakes and reservoirs. Reserving water for the 
                    healthy functioning of ecosystems is sometimes seen as far 
                    less important than providing all the water that humans 
                    demand. In recent years, however, an understanding has 
                    emerged on the need to maintain ecosystem health not just 
                    for ethical reasons, but because of the very practical 
                    benefits, sometimes called ecosystem services, that is 
                    provided to humans. These include the production of food, 
                    reduction of flood risk and filtering of harmful pollutants. 
                    Great strides have been made in understanding the freshwater 
                    needs of aquatic ecosystems. These needs are being accepted 
                    as legitimate calls on water, leading an increasing number 
                    of decision makers to give these "environmental" flows 
                    priority along with water use for economic activities. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>C. Water scarcity</B> Water scarcity 
                    occurs when the amount of water withdrawn from lakes, rivers 
                    or groundwater is so great that water supplies are no longer 
                    adequate to satisfy all human or ecosystem requirements, 
                    bringing about increased competition among potential 
                    demands. Scarcities are likely to happen sooner in regions 
                    where the per capita availability of water is low to start 
                    with and with high population growth. They become more 
                    serious if demand per capita is growing due to changes in 
                    consumption pattern. <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Global withdrawals of water to satisfy demands have 
                    grown dramatically in this century. Between 1900 and 1995, 
                    water withdrawals increased by over six times, more than 
                    double the rate of population growth. This rapid growth in 
                    water demand is due to the increasing reliance on irrigation 
                    to achieve food security, the growth of industrial uses, and 
                    the increasing use per capita for domestic purposes.

                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>The increased demands are causing water stress in many 
                    areas of the world, even in some humid areas where rising 
                    demand or pollution have caused over utilization of the 
                    local resource. Already, about 460 million people, more than 
                    8 per cent of the world's population, live in countries 
                    using so much of their water resources that they can be 
                    considered to be highly water stressed. A further 
                    one-quarter of the world's population lives in countries 
                    where the use of water is so high that they are likely to 
                    move into situations of serious water stress.

                    <P class=clsTextItem>1. Quantity</P>
                    <LI>Irrigated agriculture takes about 70 per cent of water 
                    withdrawals, and the figure rises to 90 per cent in the dry 
                    tropics. Agriculture is by far the biggest consumptive use 
                    of water, representing 87 per cent of the total. 
                    Traditionally, most food has been grown on rainfed lands, 
                    relying on soil moisture supplied by rainfall, but as food 
                    demand rises, this is increasingly supplemented by 
                    irrigation, using water drawn from lakes, rivers and 
                    underground aquifers. Irrigated agriculture contributes 
                    nearly 40 per cent of world food production from just 17 per 
                    cent of cultivated land. Much of the dramatic increase in 
                    food production of recent decades, including the Green 
                    Revolution, requires high-yield plant varieties, combined 
                    with fertilizers and pest control, and depends on irrigation 
                    to ensure adequate and timely water for high growth. Water 
                    withdrawals for irrigation have increased by over 60 per 
                    cent since 1960. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Until the late 1970s, the growth in the amount of land 
                    being irrigated exceeded the rate of population growth. 
                    Since then, the amount of irrigated land has increased more 
                    slowly than population, due to a limited amount of 
                    additional land suitable for irrigation, increasing water 
                    scarcities and the loss of some irrigated areas to soil 
                    degradation including soil salinization. However, total 
                    agricultural output has continued to outstrip population 
                    growth, owing to productivity increases. Currently, the 
                    world can produce enough food for everyone, but an estimated 
                    840 million people are lack access to sufficient food for 
                    their nourishment, and are hampered in carrying on 
                    productive, working lives because they cannot afford to buy 
                    enough food. As the number of people to feed increases, it 
                    will be ever more of a challenge to produce enough food at 
                    prices people can afford. In many regions, in particular 
                    arid and semi-arid regions, the amount of water available 
                    for irrigation will become increasingly limited and costly.

                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>In some areas, the withdrawals are so high that the flow 
                    of rivers decreases as they move downstream, and some lakes 
                    are shrinking. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Groundwater supplies one-third of the world's 
                    population, and is the main or only source of water for 
                    rural dwellers in many parts of the world and is also 
                    increasingly the main source for irrigation. Underground 
                    sources are being heavily overused in a number of regions, 
                    with water being pumped out faster than nature can replenish 
                    the supply. The excessive use of groundwater is likely to 
                    increase over the next 30 years. Over pumping groundwater 
                    has dropped water levels by tens of metres in places, making 
                    it increasingly difficult and expensive for people to have 
                    continued access to the water. In a number of regions, 
                    depletion has forced people to turn to lower quality 
                    groundwater sources, some of which contain natural 
                    contaminants. The overuse of groundwater can have a serious 
                    effect on the base flow of rivers, especially during dry 
                    periods, so vital for aquatic ecosystems. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>Aral Sea </B></P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem>In 1960, the Aral Sea was the fourth 
                    largest inland body of water in the world. Since then it has 
                    shrunk to less than half its original size because of the 
                    nearly total cutoff of inflow from the Amu Dar'ya and Syr 
                    Dar'ya rivers as result of heavy withdrawals for irrigation. 
                    The desiccation of the Aral has resulted in the loss of its 
                    fishing industry, the destruction of its ecosystem and 
                    deltas, the blowing of salts from the exposed seabed which 
                    are toxic to humans and deleterious to crops, and depressing 
                    the economy. Indiscriminate use of water for 
                    non-agricultural purposes, inefficient irrigation practices, 
                    excessive use of chemicals for growing cotton and rice 
                    crops, and the lack of adequate drainage caused extensive 
                    waterlogging and salinity, and polluted the groundwater and 
                    drainage inflows to the rivers and the sea. Water pollution 
                    from urban and industrial wastes has further aggravated the 
                    problems. To stabilize the environment and rehabilitate the 
                    economy of the Aral Sea Basin, the governments of the five 
                    independent riparian states have begun a large and complex 
                    program intended to assist them to cooperate and adopt

                    <LI>Many groundwater aquifers are recharged on a regular 
                    basis by rain and melting snows. However, some groundwater 
                    reservoirs that were filled under different climatic 
                    conditions, often thousands of years ago, are known as 
                    fossil aquifers, and if used, they will not be recharged by 
                    nature for a very long time, if ever. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>In some cases, groundwater depletion results in the land 
                    above aquifers sinking. Land subsidence caused by high water 
                    withdrawals has been recorded in many countries, including 
                    Mexico, the United States, Japan, China and Thailand, with 
                    the land sinking from 1 to 10 metres. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Over utilization of aquifers near seacoasts leads to 
                    intrusion from the ocean, which contaminates the fresh water 
                    with salt. Small islands fall in a special category because 
                    for many of them fresh water is a fragile resource. If the 
                    fresh water is overdrawn, this leads to salt water 
                    intrusion. People on some small islands have been forced to 
                    turn to expensive alternatives, including desalination and 
                    importing water by tanker. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>3. Water pollution issues <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>For millennia, people have used water as a convenient 
                    sink into which to dump wastes. The pollution comes from 
                    many sources, including untreated sewage, chemical 
                    discharges, petroleum leaks and spills, dumping in old mines 
                    and pits, and agricultural chemicals that are washed off or 
                    seep downward from farm fields. In one area after another, 
                    the amounts and types of waste discharged have outstripped 
                    nature's ability to break them down into less harmful 
                    elements. Pollution spoils large quantities of water which 
                    then cannot be used, or at best can be used for restricted 
                    purposes only. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The impairment of water quality near major urban centres 
                    is recognized as a major problem. In parts of the world, 
                    water quality has been so degraded that it is unfit even for 
                    industrial purposes. Even when the levels of some pollutants 
                    seem to be low, they can pose a threat by accumulating in 
                    the aquatic food chain, affecting the health of these 
                    creatures, and threatening the health of humans who eat 
                    contaminated wildlife. Groundwaters, once contaminated, are 
                    very difficult to clean up because the rate of flow is 
                    usually slow. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Among major water pollution problems: 
                    <OL class=clsTextItem>
                      <LI>Contaminated water that people drink without adequate 
                      treatment is one of the major cause of human illness. 
                      micro-organisms found in human and animal wastes include a 
                      wide range of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other 
                      organisms that cause many diseases. These are present in 
                      virtually all wastes discharged, even those from most 
                      sewage treatment plants. As a result, it is necessary to 
                      treat drinking water to prevent outbreaks of disease. 
                      <LI>Accelerated growth of algae fertilized by the 
                      phosphorus and nitrogen present in many discharges, 
                      including human and animal wastes, detergents and runoff 
                      from fertilizers. These two elements act as nutrients when 
                      discharged into water, greatly speeding up the process 
                      called eutrophication. Excessive algal growth leads to a 
                      decline in the oxygen content in the water, which can 
                      suffocate some forms of aquatic life. It can also impart a 
                      foul taste to drinking water. Eutrophication, first 
                      noticed in many Western European and North American Lakes 
                      in the 1950s, is now leading to the decline in water 
                      quality on all continents. When the nutrients drain into 
                      oceans, they can increase in the number of toxic algal 
                      blooms, sometimes known as red tides, which can make 
                      seafood unsafe to eat. 
                      <LI>Nitrates from fertilizers, human and cattle wastes are 
                      polluting groundwater in many regions. High nitrate levels 
                      in drinking water decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of 
                      haemoglobin in blood, which can threaten the health of 
                      infants. A UN study say that nitrate pollution will likely 
                      be one of the most pressing water quality problems in 
                      Europe and North America in the coming decade, and will 
                      become a serious problem in other countries, such as India 
                      and Brazil, if present trends continue. 
                      <LI>Some of the more than 100,000 commercial chemicals in 
                      the world, as well as a number of chemical waste 
                      by-products, are known or suspected to cause harmful 
                      effects in humans, plants and animals. One class of 
                      compounds, known as Persistent Organic Pollutants, which 
                      include such well-known substances as PCBs and DDT, has 
                      created many of the problems because they are toxic, 
                      highly persistent in the environment and they build up in 
                      the food chain. These and other chlorinate organic 
                      chemicals have been so widely distributed by air and ocean 
                      currents that they are found in the tissues of people and 
                      wildlife everywhere. 
                      <LI>Heavy metals are found naturally in soil and water, 
                      but their worldwide production and use by industry, 
                      agriculture and mining have released large amounts into 
                      the environment. The metals of greatest concern for human 
                      health are lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium. Many other 
                      metals, including copper, silver, selenium, zinc and 
                      chromium, are also highly toxic to aquatic life. Water 
                      pollution related to metal production and use, including 
                      the release of acids from mining wastes, is a problem in 
                      many of the world's mining and metal processing regions. 
                      Elevated levels of some metals, such as lead and mercury, 
                      are also found around many cities, and downwind from metal 
                      smelters and coal-burning power plants. </LI></OL>

                    <LI>In theory, virtually all pollutants can be removed from 
                    water, but in practice decontaminating water, especially in 
                    the case of toxic substances, is very expensive, and 
                    requires sophisticated techniques. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Water pollution problems vary in severity around the 
                    world, depending on population densities, the types and 
                    amounts of industrial and agricultural development, and the 
                    number and efficiency of waste treatment systems that are 
                    used. The global magnitude of pollution is difficult to 
                    quantify because of a scarcity of information in many 
                    countries. There are estimates that in developing countries, 
                    which often lack the resources to build and maintain sewage 
                    treatment systems, 90 per cent of waste water is discharged 
                    without treatment. A UN study found that in Latin America, 
                    virtually all domestic sewage and industrial waste is 
                    discharged untreated into the nearest streams. In most 
                    areas, domestic sewage volumes are far higher than those of 
                    industrial discharges. There were similar findings from West 
                    Africa, where there were signs of shallow aquifers being 
                    contaminated by the seepage of human wastes. In Western 
                    Asia, the major water quality problem identified was 
                    salinity caused by widespread irrigation, although other 
                    water quality problems may not be evident due to lack of 
                    monitoring programs. In the Asia and Pacific region, in 
                    addition to domestic and industrial wastes, there are also 
                    high sediment loads in rivers resulting from high erosion 
                    upstream where much land is left exposed due to the removal 
                    of forest. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The water pollution problems in many developing 
                    countries mirror those already experienced by developed 
                    countries in Europe and North America. A few decades ago 
                    some rivers in rich nations were so polluted that fires 
                    broke out on their oil-slicked surfaces. This was documented 
                    both in Canada and the United States. Due largely to public 
                    pressure, controls have been imposed on much of the gross 
                    pollution, and clean-ups are taking place, often at very 
                    high cost to the present generation. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>While much of the world's pollution is directly released 
                    from discharge pipes and sewers, or is carried off polluted 
                    industrial, municipal and agricultural areas by rainfall and 
                    melting snows, a significant pollution load is transferred 
                    long distances by the atmosphere. Several decades ago 
                    researchers discovered that the release of tens of millions 
                    of tonnes of a year of sulphur and nitrogen caused sulphuric 
                    and nitric acid fallout. This acid rain affects large areas 
                    of the world, including parts of Europe, North America, 
                    Latin America, India and Asia. It has killed parts of 
                    ecosystems, and can threaten human health by dissolving 
                    metals into the water. In addition to acids, there is 
                    long-range airborne transport of a wide range of chemicals 
                    and metals from such sources industries, motor vehicles, 
                    power plants, smelters and incinerators. Pesticide use is 
                    another important source because some of the chemicals 
                    evaporate into the air, and others adhere to tiny dust 
                    particles, both of which can be carried great distances by 
                    wind currents. Sometimes, the pollutants build up in the 
                    food chain, and are passed on to humans who rely on wild 
                    foods. Tests of breast milk from women in some northern 
                    latitudes, where there is little industry and no 
                    agriculture, found levels of PCBs and certain pesticides 
                    were four to 10 times higher than in women from regions 
                    hundreds of kilometres to the south. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Since most lakes and rivers eventually drain to the 
                    seas, the freshwater waste discharges also have an impact on 
                    coastal and even deep-sea ecosystems. About 80 per cent of 
                    marine pollution is caused by human activities on land. The 
                    water in the oceans will never be clean, unless pollution 
                    from sources on land is not controlled.

                    <LI>The need to provide safe drinking water and sanitation 
                    and to reduce water contamination are basic questions of 
                    equity and protection for human health. They were emphasized 
                    in the Mar del Plata conference of 1977. In 1980, the UN 
                    General Assembly proclaimed in Resolution 35/18 that the 
                    period 1981-1990 would be the International Drinking Water 
                    Supply and Sanitation Decade, "during which Member States 
                    will assume a commitment to bring about a substantial 
                    improvement in the standards and level of services in 
                    drinking water supply and sanitation by the year 1990." The 
                    issue continued to receive attention at such 
                    intergovernmental conferences as the Global Consultation on 
                    Safe Water and Sanitation in New Delhi in 1990 and the 
                    Noordwijk conference of 1994.

                    <LI>In the past two decades, these essential services were 
                    provided to millions of people world-wide, saving a great 
                    many lives and reducing illness. However, the rate of supply 
                    has not kept pace with that of population growth, and 20 per 
                    cent of the world's population lacks access to safe water 
                    supply, while 50 per cent lacks access to adequate 
                    sanitation. The vast majority of these people live in 
                    developing countries. This lack of access to safe drinking 
                    water and sanitation is directly related to poverty, and, in 
                    some cases, the inability of governments to invest in these 
                    systems. In a number of regions, poor people lack access to 
                    piped water, and must buy from vendors, so they pay more for 
                    their water than rich people. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>A great deal of treated drinking water is lost 
                    unnecessarily. There are estimates that about half the water 
                    in drinking water supply systems in the developing world is 
                    lost due to leakage, illegal hookups and vandalism. This 
                    deprives operators of the water supply systems of money they 
                    could use to maintain and expand service. The World Bank 
                    estimates that about $600 billion needs to be invested 
                    worldwide to repair and improve water delivery systems.

                    <LI>Human health is closely linked to safe drinking water 
                    and sanitation, and to sound management of land and water 
                    resources, particularly in the context of water resources 
                    development projects. At any given time, an estimated 
                    one-half of the people in developing countries are suffering 
                    from water or food associated diseases caused either 
                    directly by infection through the consumption of 
                    contaminated water or food, or indirectly by 
                    disease-carrying organisms (vectors), such as mosquitoes, 
                    that breed in water. The most widespread of these diseases 
                    and with the greatest impact on human health status are 
                    diarrhoea, malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue, infection by 
                    intestinal worms, and river blindness (onchocerciasis). 
                    According to the World Health Organization, some 2 billion 
                    people are at risk of malaria alone, with 100 million people 
                    affected at any one time and between one and two million 
                    deaths a year. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The WHO estimates that a total of more than five million 
                    people die each year just from diseases caused by unsafe 
                    drinking water, and a lack of sanitation and water for 
                    hygiene. Provision of safe drinking water and sanitation 
                    could reduce the amount of illness and death by as much as 
                    three-quarters, depending on the disease. The toll is not 
                    only a human tragedy, but it means these people are less 
                    able to carry on productive lives, which undermines social 
                    and economic development. An outbreak of cholera, a 
                    water-borne disease, began in Peru a few years ago and 
                    spread through many parts of Latin America, killing hundreds 
                    of people, and costing hundreds of millions of dollars in 
                    lost income. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>There are other economic impacts caused by poor water 
                    supply systems. Women are the main water providers, 
                    especially in developing countries, and the provision of 
                    basic drinking water supply systems could also reduce the 
                    annual expenditure of over 10 million person-years of effort 
                    by women and female children carrying water from distant 
                    sources. Reallocation of the time spend in this unproductive 
                    activity would assist in poverty alleviation. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>2. Health effects of other contaminants 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>In humans, high levels of exposure to some chemicals and 
                    heavy metals have been linked to a number of illnesses, 
                    including cancer, damage to the nervous system and birth 
                    defects. Pollutants can build up in the food chain to the 
                    point that they harm people, as with Minamata disease caused 
                    by people eating seafood contaminated with mercury from 
                    industrial discharges. The cumulative effects of long-term 
                    exposure to a variety of chemicals at what seem like low 
                    concentrations cannot be well quantified at present. Studies 
                    in North America suggest a link between fetal exposure to 
                    high levels of some organochlorines and reduced learning 
                    ability in children. There is also suggestive evidence from 
                    wildlife studies that humans may be at risk from a number of 
                    subtle effects, such as disruptions in the endocrine system 
                    caused when synthetic materials interfere with the body's 
                    normal chemical balance. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Toxic chemical effects have been more clearly recorded 
                    in wildlife. The effects include, cancer, death, eggshell 
                    thinning, population declines, reduced hatching success, 
                    abnormal behaviour, changes in organ development, 
                    infertility, birth defects and a range of other illnesses. 
                    There are also less visible effects on body chemistry, 
                    including abnormalities in the thyroid, liver and endocrine 
                    systems. Some organochlorines appear to have the ability to 
                    mimic or block the normal functioning of hormones, 
                    interfering with natural body processes, including normal 
                    sexual development. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>F. Stress on land resources</B> 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>The stresses on water and land are closely linked. For 
                    thousands of years, humans have been drawing water from 
                    rivers and wells to irrigate dry lands thus growing more 
                    food. And, for millennia, inadequate drainage systems have 
                    resulted in waterlogging and soil salinization. The 
                    salinization happens when water in the ground evaporates, 
                    leaving behind natural salts that were present in the water. 
                    It is estimated that about 20 per cent of the world's 250 
                    million hectares of irrigated land are salt affected to an 
                    extent that crop production is significantly reduced. A 
                    further one and one-half million hectares are affected each 
                    year. The countries most severely affected are predominantly 
                    located in arid and semi-arid regions.

                    10.</A> Map of soil degradation. <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>The mismanagement of soil and water resources is also 
                    excarcebating erosion brought about by water. This depletes 
                    the land of soil and nutrients, and increases water 
                    pollution in the form of soil particles that often carry 
                    agricultural chemicals with them. When suspended soil 
                    particles arrive at a dam, they often sink to the bottom of 
                    the reservoir, gradually reducing the amount of water it can 
                    hold. This process has caused serious losses of reservoir 
                    capacity in a number of river basins. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>The Murray-Darling Basin covers 
                    one-seventh of Australia, and accounts for half the 
                    country's gross agricultural production. As demands for 
                    water increased, reservoirs were constructed to increase the 
                    available supply to individual states. In recent years, use 
                    approached the sustainable yield of the basin as a whole, 
                    and pressure mounted for sharing the resource between 
                    jurisdictions. In 1985, a Basin Commission was formed and in 
                    1989, agreement was reached on sharing. The next issue 
                    requiring resolution was soil salinity that had the 
                    potential to expand to 95 per cent of the total irrigated 
                    area within 50 years. The three upstream states were the 
                    primary beneficiaries of water diversion, while the damage 
                    caused by salinity was most severe in the downstream state. 
                    An agreement was reached on joint funding of remedial 
                    measures and collaboration was initiated, driven primarily 
                    from the community level. Action has been under way for four 
                    years, and the spirit of collaboration continues as a 
                    demonstration of integrated water management success. </P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>G. Extent and geographical 
                    distribution of water stresses due to scarcity</B> 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>In keeping with the concept of water scarcity previously 
                    defined, the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability 
                    on an annual basis is used as a measure of stress. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>It has been observed that water stress can begin as the 
                    use of fresh water rises above 10 per cent of renewable 
                    freshwater resources, and it becomes more pronounced as the 
                    use level crosses the 20 per cent level. On average, a 
                    country can only capture about one-third of the annual flow 
                    of water in its rivers using dams, reservoirs and intake 
                    pipes. A further limitation arises from the growing lack of 
                    acceptance for the social and environmental impacts of large 
                    dams. The closest and most economical sources of water are 
                    used first, and it becomes increasingly expensive to tap 
                    sources that are farther away from the needs. Another 
                    limitation to water use is that once withdrawals pass 
                    certain thresholds, which vary from site to site, lake and 
                    river levels fall to the point that other uses are harmed. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>This report distinguishes four categories of water 
                    stress based on the amount of available fresh water that is 
                    used. 
                    <OL class=clsTextItem>
                      <LI>Low water stress. Countries that use less than 10 per 
                      cent of their available fresh water generally do not 
                      experience major stresses on the available resources. 
                      <LI>Moderate water stress. Use in the range of 10 to 20 
                      per cent of available water generally indicates that 
                      availability is becoming a limiting factor, and 
                      significant effort and investments are needed to increase 
                      supply and reduce demand. 
                      <LI>Medium-high water stress. When water withdrawals are 
                      in the range of 20-40 per cent of the water available, 
                      management of both supply and demand will be required to 
                      ensure that the uses remain sustainable. There will be a 
                      need to resolve competing human uses, and aquatic 
                      ecosystems will require special attention to ensure they 
                      have adequate water flows. Developing countries, in 
                      particular, will need major investments to improve water 
                      use efficiency and the portion of Gross National Product 
                      allocated to water resources management can become 
                      substantial. 
                      <LI>High water stress. Use of more than 40 per cent of 
                      available water indicates serious scarcity, and usually an 
                      increasing dependence on desalination and use of 
                      groundwater faster than it is replenished. It means there 
                      is an urgent need for intensive management of supply and 
                      demand. Present use patterns and withdrawals may not be 
                      sustainable, and water scarcity can become the limiting 
                      factor to economic growth. </LI></OL>

                    11.</A> This map shows water withdrawal as a percentage of 
                    water availability. Calculations are based on both internal 
                    water resources and water available from upstream sources in 
                    international basins. Many countries with high water 
                    withdrawal rates are also very dependent on external water. 
                    Because the data used to prepare this map were gathered at a 
                    country level, there are some apparent contradictions. For 
                    example, the Sahel region does not show as having a high 
                    water stress, even though it is a dry region. This is 
                    because a number of countries in dry regions have relatively 
                    abundant water resources in part of the country, as in one 
                    large river, such as the Nile or Niger. They might also have 
                    abundant rainfall for part of the year. However, the poor 
                    countries in this category lack the financial and technical 
                    resources to capture rainfall or to move water to many of 
                    their people. Even water rich countries can have tremendous 
                    disparities internally. </P>

                    water issues. In general, countries with higher per capita 
                    incomes are in a better position than low-income countries 
                    to respond to water scarcity, as the financial resources and 
                    skilled people for management and development are more 
                    readily available. Because of low income levels, many 
                    developing countries face severe difficulties in creating 
                    the infrastructure to fully utilize their water resources.

                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>Table 1.</B> This grid shows how the 
                    5.7 billion people in the world in 1995 were distributed in 
                    terms of their use of available fresh water, and by their 
                    income as measured in GNP. Over one-half the world falls in 
                    the low income category, and more than one-third of these 
                    people are in countries that already face medium-high to 
                    high water stress. An additional 39 per cent are in 
                    countries with moderate water stress. As well, one-fifth of 
                    the world is in the lower-middle income category. Of these, 
                    31 per cent are in countries with medium-high water stress, 
                    and 24 per cent are in countries with moderate water stress. 
                    Unless water resources are managed with a view to achieving 
                    efficiency and equity, water shortages could become a 
                    serious obstacle to economic and social development in many 
                    poorer countries. </P>

                    <LI>When water stress and income levels are combined, the 
                    result is a series of categories showing the vulnerability 
                    of various countries and regions to problems caused by water 
                    scarcities. Each of these could be sub-divided into a number 
                    of specialized categories, by water stresses and financial 
                    coping capability. For illustrative purposes, this report 
                    shows the effects on four broad categories.

                    stress <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Their main problem is water pollution rather than 
                    supply, although some large countries contain water poor 
                    regions. They have the financial resources to deal with 
                    regional water supply problems, often using water 
                    diversions.

                    water stress. <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>This category includes a number of countries that have 
                    fairly large amounts of water, but are facing stress 
                    conditions as a result of continuing over-use and pollution 
                    of their water resources causing problems, such as 
                    groundwater depletion, in the near future. Other countries 
                    have, however, already used most of their accessible water 
                    resources. They have little if any scope for increasing the 
                    amount of water supplied to human uses through conventional 
                    means without inflicting damage to aquatic ecosystems, or 
                    seriously depleting groundwater aquifers. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>3. Low income countries with low water 
                    stress <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>There are several different types of countries within 
                    this grouping. There are low income countries that have low 
                    water stress because they have abundant water resources, 
                    primarily in tropical humid countries, or large countries 
                    that have a tropical region. Most of these countries or 
                    their humid regions suffer from too much water in the form 
                    of floods that come during a short rainy or monsoon season, 
                    causing damage to buildings, structures and agriculture. 
                    Since these countries are poor, they often suffer from 
                    inadequate drinking water supply and sanitation. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Another category, which includes much of Sub-Saharan 
                    Africa and some other countries in arid and semi-arid areas, 
                    has little water and little water stress because people are 
                    too poor to tap much of the resource. Overall, this grouping 
                    of countries suffers from inadequate access to its water 
                    resources due to insufficient financial resources, technical 
                    expertise and institutional support. Because of these 
                    constraints there is a lack of adequate water supply, 
                    sanitation and waste water treatment. In cases where there 
                    is high population growth or economic development, there is 
                    likely to be an increase in water demand. If that demand is 
                    not well managed, it could drive the country into a high 
                    vulnerability situation. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>4. Low income countries with high water 
                    stress <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>This category is made up of low-income countries that 
                    are using their water resources heavily now, often for farm 
                    irrigation. They also suffer from a lack of pollution 
                    controls. A number of countries in the arid or semi-arid 
                    regions of Africa and Asia fall in this category. These 
                    countries are the most constrained for future development 
                    because they have neither the extra water nor the financial 
                    resources to shift development away from intensive 
                    irrigation and into other sectors that would create 
                    employment and generate income with which to buy food from 
                    water-rich countries.<A name=Water>

                    OUT-LOOK</A> </H3>
                    <LI>In this section, the report draws a number of 
                    implications for future water use patterns, based on current 
                    trends. From 1995, it looks forward for 30 years, which is 
                    the span of a generation, examining major forces that will 
                    affect and be affected by water use. It is difficult to 
                    provide a detailed picture of the world of 2025 because of 
                    many uncertainties in political and economic developments. 
                    However, it is possible to look ahead, and provide some 
                    general analyses.
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>A. Driving forces of change</B> 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Water use in 2025 is going to be shaped by several major 
                    driving forces: 
                    <OL class=clsTextItem>
                      <LI>Population will influence how much water will be 
                      needed for a wide range of needs, including food 
                      production, industrial development and domestic use. The 
                      mid-range projection from the United Nations is that world 
                      population will grow from 5.7 billion in 1995 to about 8.3 
                      billion in 2025, an increase of 2.6 billion people. Much 
                      of the population increase will be in the rapidly growing 
                      urban areas of developing countries, many of which are 
                      already experiencing serious water stress. 
                      <LI>The magnitude of the impact of a given population will 
                      vary depending on the amount and patterns of consumption 
                      of natural resources and of pollution. Depending on what 
                      technologies are used, the impact from a given type of 
                      consumption can be increased or decreased from today's 
                      levels. For example, if more food is produced by 
                      increasing the amount of irrigation, using the same mix of 
                      technologies as today, the water use will increase. The 
                      same is true of the continuing industrial development. A 
                      UNIDO study showed that current trends will lead to a more 
                      than doubling of 1995 industrial water use by 2025, with 
                      over a four-fold rise in industrial pollution loading 
                      unless changes are made. If more water efficient 
                      technologies are used, this would cut wastage, and thus 
                      reduce the amount of water that needs to taken from 
                      various sources to produce a given amount of food or 
                      industrial output. In the agricultural and industrial 
                      sectors, there are already many examples of technology 
                      changes that have reduced both the amount of water used 
                      and the amount of pollution released without reducing the 
                      output of products. At the domestic level, there are many 
                      examples of water-efficient fixtures, and there are 
                      attempts to educate more people in the safe use of 
                      hazardous materials to reduce the amount dumped into 
                      waterways or drains leading to waterways. 
                      <LI>Trade policies. A large part of the increase in world 
                      food demand will come from the arid and semi-arid 
                      developing world, where there are high population growth 
                      rates. Many of these countries will find it difficult to 
                      keep increases in food production in line with demand 
                      increases, and water will be a limiting factor. Countries 
                      may have to choose between using their scarce water 
                      resources to maintain food self-sufficiency, or to use the 
                      water to produce high value products that can be exported 
                      to pay for food imports. </LI></OL>
                    <P><BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Most of the new population will be found in the 
                    developing world, and those countries will move from being 
                    37 per cent urban in 1995 to 56 per cent urban in 2025. At 
                    the same time, there is more industrial development. These 
                    trends take both people and water supplies from agriculture, 
                    and creating an urgent need for more urban sanitation. 
                    Peri-urban agriculture is also increasing. By 1995, the 
                    world had 321 cities with populations over 1 million, 
                    including 15 mega-cities with populations in the 10 to 20 
                    million range. The number of mega-cities is forecast to 
                    double over the next 20 years. In spite of that, there will 
                    still be more rural poor in 2025. If regions with high rates 
                    of urbanization are to maintain current levels of water and 
                    sanitation supply, this could mean investments over 1 per 
                    cent of GDP by 2025.

                    <LI>There is another potential factor that could affect 
                    water availability. According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
                    on Climate Change, the release of gases such as CO2 are 
                    increasing the ability of the atmosphere to trap heat. The 
                    panel warns that this may bring temperature increases, 
                    precipitation changes and sea level rise, with impacts 
                    varying on the availability of fresh water around the world. 
                    Computer models of possible future climate patterns are not 
                    yet precise enough to forecast changes at the local or small 
                    basin level. Current indications are that if climate change 
                    is gradual, the impacts may only be minor by 2025, with some 
                    countries having positive impacts, and most being negatively 
                    affected. Climate change impacts are predicted to become 
                    increasing strong during the decades following 2025.
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>B. Outlook and challenges that lie 
                    ahead</B> <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Although there is a very large uncertainty about future 
                    water needs, it is clear that all sectors will have growing 
                    requirements, and they already face stresses in many regions 
                    of the world. Given current trends, as much as two-thirds of 
                    the world population in 2025 may be subject to moderate to 
                    high water stress, and almost half the world would have 
                    clear difficulties in coping due to inadequate financial 
                    resources. Since many of the countries currently facing 
                    moderate to high water stress, as well as those that risk 
                    moving into higher stress categories by 2025 belong to the 
                    lower income groups, it is clear that water resources could 
                    become a limiting factor in the development of a number of 
                    countries. For reasons spelled out earlier in this report, 
                    it will also be more difficult and expensive to easily 
                    augment reliable water supplies by building more dams and 
                    creating reservoirs. There will be a need to modify 
                    consumption patterns, and to design and construct water 
                    supply projects in such a way as to bring into the planning 
                    both the people who may suffer and those who benefit, and to 
                    ensure that benefits are distributed fairly. Demand 
                    management will serve as an essential policy tool. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Many economic forecasts do not currently account for the 
                    amount water that will be required to achieve their goals, 
                    and water may become a limiting factor. Certain current 
                    water-intensive patterns of development will become less and 
                    less feasible. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>As the risk of water stress increases, there will be a 
                    need for increased demand management in order to maximize 
                    the socio-economic benefits derived from the competing users 
                    of water. Water management must also be more prudent than in 
                    the past to avoid further degrading agricultural areas 
                    through such impacts as salinization, water erosion and 
                    waterlogging. Failure to protect the food growing capability 
                    of the world would have severe implications. To avert such 
                    problems countries, particularly water scarce countries, 
                    need to look at projections in such sectors as population, 
                    urbanization, economic and agricultural development, and 
                    establish water strategies and policies. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>One of the trends identified in this report is that as 
                    water becomes more scarce in relation to demand, and 
                    competition among various users increases, water ceases to 
                    be available as a free good and in some cases becomes a 
                    tradable commodity. There is a shift taking place in the 
                    role of governments from being providers of water at very 
                    low cost, to regulators of water markets. As competition for 
                    available water grows among users, such as municipalities, 
                    industries, hydro-electric generators and irrigators, the 
                    price of water rises. While this allows the marketplace to 
                    choose the highest-valued use for water in economic terms, 
                    it will almost certainly mean water price increases, and 
                    this means that some users will be able to outbid others for 
                    the available water. This has the potential to impose 
                    hardships on some users, and there will be a need to ensure 
                    that everyone has a basic amount of water available at

                    <P class=clsTextItem>1. Water needs for food production 
                    <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>World population forecasts suggest that within 30 years 
                    nearly 50 per cent more people than in 1995 will need to be 
                    fed. A substantial portion of future population growth is 
                    forecast for arid and semi-arid regions. Here, rainfed crop 
                    production is insecure because of a short rainy season, 
                    erratic rainfall, recurrent drought years, high evaporation 
                    of the rain that does fall and crust-forming, 
                    desertification-prone soils. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where 
                    over 95 per cent of the farmers depend on rainfed farming, 
                    the per capita production of cereals in the past two decades 
                    has not risen, and remains below what is needed to feed the 
                    population. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>A number of estimates were made of how much water would 
                    be needed to produce enough food to give everyone in the 
                    world a healthy diet. The estimates ranged between a 50 to 
                    100 per cent increase in water for food production over 30 
                    years. The bulk of the increase in food production will need 
                    to come from irrigated land. Some of the estimates found 
                    that by 2025, it would require virtually all the 
                    economically accessible water in the world to meet the needs 
                    of agriculture, industry and households, and maintain 
                    adequate lake levels and flows in rivers. If more water is 
                    needed, more expensive projects such as high cost dams and 
                    diversions to bring water from sources far away from the 
                    area will be required. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>As water becomes more scarce, municipalities and 
                    industries will be able to outbid most farmers, and this 
                    will push up the cost of water. If cost of water is passed 
                    on to consumer, food prices will go up. If farmers have to 
                    absorb the increased cost, poorer farmers growing relatively 
                    low value products could be forced out of business. While in 
                    the long run the use of pricing as a tool for allocating 
                    water resources is effective, the implementation of pricing 
                    policies need to take into account the possible economic and 
                    social impacts on the peri-urban and rural poor. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>As food production is closely linked to the quality of 
                    land, the proper management of irrigation is essential in 
                    order to prevent land degradation such as salinization and 
                    waterlogging. The installation of adequate drainage, while 
                    protecting this natural capital, is likely to raise the cost 
                    of irrigation.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>2. Water supply and sanitation and 
                    health <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>The regions most vulnerable to domestic water shortages 
                    include those that presently have poor access to water, and 
                    have rapid population growth, uncontrolled urbanization, 
                    financial problems and which lack of a skilled work force. 
                    Even if the world maintained the pace of the 1990s in water 
                    supply development, it would not be enough to ensure that 
                    everyone had access to safe drinking water by 2025. The 
                    challenge is particularly critical in Africa. Sanitation 
                    development is even more difficult to achieve. If everyone 
                    is to have sanitation facilities by 2025, this means 
                    providing services for more than 5 billion people in 30 
                    years. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The continued neglect on the need for waste water 
                    treatment and damage from water pollution will lead to 
                    increases in public health problems and further damage to 
                    ecosystems, including the oceans, and foregone opportunities 
                    to recover and treat waste water for other uses, such as 
                    irrigation.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>3. What will happen? <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>The analyses show that if many of the current approaches 
                    to water management to not change, this will lead to 
                    increasing water stress. As scarcities increase, there will 
                    be the risk of greater conflict over the water in the more 
                    than 300 transboundary rivers as well as many underground 
                    aquifers. This shows the importance of cooperation over 
                    river systems shared by countries. It will be crucial to 
                    work out water sharing arrangements which seeks to maximize 
                    benefits for all users. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Since it typically takes at least a decade to bring even 
                    a modest water resources project from planning to 
                    completion, and even more time for large projects, it is 
                    crucial for decision makers to immediately make and 
                    implement water policies and programs based on the best 
                    evidence available. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The concluding section provides suggestions for

                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>A. Elements of a water strategy - 
                    general considerations</B> <BR><BR></P>
                    <LI>Although many current water use patterns and pollution 
                    habits are sending the world toward a series of local and 
                    regional water crises, mankind have not yet crossed the line 
                    of no return. There are many practical, cost effective 
                    measures that can reduce the strain on water resources. They 
                    represent a series of critical investment opportunities that 
                    cannot afford to be ignore. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>It is crucial for water resources to be given a high 
                    priority in planning. There are some promising national 
                    efforts in water policy development, but these efforts must 
                    be spread and reinforced. Governments must reduce the 
                    fragmentation of institutional responsibilities on water 
                    issues. They also need to include water resources in 
                    economic analysis. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Acritical element in planning is information on the 
                    state of the water resources. Over recent decades the 
                    ability of many countries to assess water resources has 
                    actually declined because measurement networks and staffing 
                    levels have been reduced. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Since it will take time to change many unsustainable 
                    development patterns, urgent and decisive action must begin 
                    now. Experience has shown that the consequences of inaction, 
                    in terms of human suffering, social disruptions, foregone 
                    economic opportunities and the cost of undoing the harm 
                    caused to the resource and the environment will usually 
                    outweigh the human and financial resources needed in to 
                    engage into a sustainable development path. Many of the 
                    problems are of a local and regional nature, and action is 
                    primarily a national (and regional) responsibility. 
                    Nevertheless, it would be illusory to believe that anything 
                    short of a global commitment would provide the means to 
                    sustainability. Because some of the water crises could be 
                    very severe, the whole world has a stake in averting them.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>1. Making water available to increase 
                    food production</P>
                    <LI>The need and demand for food are rising steadily both 
                    because of steady population increases. A large amount of 
                    the world production of grains is used for meat production 
                    in developed countries and as the diet in developing 
                    countries gets fuller and more balanced, an increased demand 
                    for animal proteins is expected. This growing demand for 
                    meat means that more water will be needed since meat 
                    requires more water to produce than a vegetarian diet. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>In many regions, water scarcity is resulting in severe 
                    constraints to the expansion of agricultural production, 
                    thus raising pressure for water policy interventions and for 
                    more efficient water use practices. Because globally little 
                    new land of adequate quality remains to be put into 
                    production, and whereas the environmental cost of converting 
                    land use is high, the largest part of future food 
                    requirements will have to be satisfied through higher 
                    productivity on existing agricultural land. Application of 
                    water through various forms of irrigation, jointly with the 
                    use of genetically improved crops and the considered 
                    application of pest management and plant nutrition systems, 
                    are main factors of the required agricultural productivity 
                    increases to feed the world. Countries can improve the 
                    efficiency of water use for irrigation with such techniques 
                    as lining canals and the use of more efficient ways of 
                    applying water to plants. However, attention must be drawn 
                    to the fact that water use in the entire river basin can be 
                    highly efficient even though the individual irrigation 
                    schemes within the basin are inefficient, in which case 
                    seeking a higher irrigation efficiency in one scheme is 
                    bound to result in further water scarcity in the downstream 
                    schemes. Under such situations, water savings have to be 
                    sought in the use of a less water demanding mix of crops and 
                    in shifts of the cropping period into a less 
                    evaporation-intensive season. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Besides new cropping patterns and conventional 
                    first-generation irrigation, many other "drought-proofing" 
                    techniques exist. They include high-efficiency irrigation, 
                    water harvesting, inland valley swamp development, low-lift 
                    pump schemes, peri-urban irrigation with treated urban waste 
                    water and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. 
                    Irrespective of what method is chosen, it would imply a 
                    consumption of water now passing through the landscape, 
                    meaning that water would not be available downstream for 
                    other uses. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>If treated waste water is used for irrigation, it will 
                    mean that the amount of fresh water that could be used for 
                    other purposes would increase. In those water scarce 
                    countries that, because of the domestic water shortage will 
                    become heavy importers of basic food stuff, wastewater may 
                    well represent in the future the predominant long-term water 
                    supply for irrigated agriculture. Water harvesting, which 
                    means small-scale projects to capture runoff, can also 
                    improve soil moisture and food production. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Desalination of seawater is an option for such 
                    relatively low-volume, high-value, users as industries and 
                    homeowners with at least a moderate income. But, even with 
                    technological advances, wheat production with desalinated 
                    water is economically prohibitive. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>As water prices rise, small scale farmers will face 
                    increasingly difficulties competing for the scarce water 
                    resources. There may thus be a need to help the small 
                    irrigation farmer, particularly with partnerships that will 
                    give them access to capital, technology, know-how and 
                    markets. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>However, there are limitations to how much these 
                    techniques will improve the situation, especially in arid 
                    countries. Countries may have to turn toward increasing food 
                    imports, as is already the case for a number of arid 
                    countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. 
                    Countries may have non-economic reasons to pursue a course 
                    of substantial food self-sufficiency. From an economic point 
                    of view, they may find it advantageous to shift their 
                    production pattern toward less water-intensive and higher 
                    income-yielding products, either in agriculture or the 
                    industrial sector. This transition is already taking place 
                    in a few countries. In Israel, the water use within various 
                    sectors is very efficient. Water availability is, however, 
                    so limited that allocation choices between sectors competing 
                    for the water resources are increasingly necessary. In this 
                    situation, the previous high priority to irrigation is 
                    reduced and urban users are pronounced. In most countries, 
                    this shift will require training of the rural population to 
                    acquire skills needed in other sectors of the economy, and 
                    an infusion of capital to create new economic opportunities. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The world needs to move towards achieving the objective 
                    of global food security. In some countries, this could be 
                    done through a transition from food self-sufficiency (a 
                    capacity to produce all food within the country) to food 
                    self reliance (a capacity to provide food from national 
                    sources and through purchase from the international market). 
                    However, such an integration of the world economy is 
                    unlikely to be painless without proper consideration of 
                    world market conditions, and the potential impact on the 
                    poorer strata of the population of developing countries. 
                    Countries can only make such transition if they can rely on 
                    the world agricultural markets to provide a dependable and 
                    efficient source of supplies at stable international prices.

                    sanitation need to be increased dramatically</P>
                    <LI>Without adequate quality and sufficient quantities of 
                    water for human consumption and for personal and domestic 
                    hygiene, billions of people will continue to suffer from 
                    diarrhoea and enteric diseases, helminthic infections and 
                    other illnesses arising from unsanitary environments, 
                    improper excreta disposal and polluted water. Even though 
                    most of the suffering takes place in developing countries, 
                    the whole world will suffer. Diseases can be communicated 
                    easily over long distances. Economic stagnation resulting 
                    from ill health affects the global economy. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>There are a number of relatively simple and inexpensive 
                    techniques for supplying drinking water and sanitation. If 
                    they are to succeed they must be chosen in consultation with 
                    the users, and they must use technologies that can be 
                    installed and maintained at the community level. They must 
                    thus be user friendly, affordable and appropriate. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Top priority needs to be given to the African region, 
                    Latin America and South-east Asia. Recent estimates are that 
                    $54 billion would be needed between 1990 and 2000 to provide 
                    universal coverage only in the urban areas of the regions 
                    most in need. The resources required are more than three 
                    times the rate of present expenditure. There is no sign this 
                    amount of funding will be made available in the near future 
                    in the form of reallocation of internal government spending 
                    in nations, or in development assistance from abroad. 
                    Experience shows that in many cases additional funding for 
                    water supply and sanitation systems could be raised by 
                    charging users even modest amounts of money for the water 
                    they draw. Countries need to apply a higher degree of demand 
                    management. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>When it comes to making decisions on water supply and 
                    sanitation systems, it is vital to involve all users. For 
                    example, women already play a crucial role in providing 
                    water and in decision on hygiene in families. They should be 
                    closely involved in decision-making as well as 
                    implementation of the water and sanitation supply 
                    programmes.

                    protect human health and the rest of the environment</P>
                    <LI>If not controlled, untreated sewage from cities, 
                    industrial discharges and non-point pollution from 
                    agricultural activities and urban runoff will continue to 
                    damage rivers, aquifers and coastal zones, with devastating 
                    effects on our freshwater resources and oceans. Even though 
                    pollution prevention sometimes has a higher initial cost 
                    than discharging wastes untreated, experience shows that in 
                    the long run it is cheaper than clean-ups. Waste water, 
                    especially that which is not heavily polluted, can often be 
                    used for other purposes, such as industrial cooling and 
                    sometimes for irrigation. To encourage pollution prevention, 
                    it is important to apply the Polluter Pays Principle. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>It is important to build on the water quality management 
                    experiences of different regions. For example, Nigeria has 
                    Interim National Water Quality Guidelines and Standards that 
                    are used to set water quality standards. The United States 
                    and Canada have adopted controls on discharges that take 
                    into account the effect on downstream ecosystems, such as 
                    the Great Lakes. Canada looks at impacts on the marine 
                    environment when setting water quality objectives for rivers 
                    flowing directly to the seas.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>4. The need for cooperation is clearly 
                    demonstrated for transboundary waters</P>
                    <LI>Some of the world's more than 300 major river basins and 
                    a number of major aquifers that cross national boundaries 
                    are in regions where serious water quality or quantity 
                    problems are or soon will be evident. A wide range of 
                    transboundary water agreements exist, dealing with rivers, 
                    lakes and other water bodies. While a number of these 
                    agreements refer to river basins, most of them deal with 
                    specific waterworks, water uses and measures to control and 
                    regulate water flows. A few deal with pollution. In 1995, a 
                    Protocol was signed by the eight heads of member governments 
                    of the Southern African Development Community on regionally 
                    shared watercourses. The member states recognized that a 
                    failure to develop water resources in a sustainable manner 
                    could hamper economic productivity and social development in 
                    the region. The agreement promotes the equitable use of 
                    shared water resources, including the development of 
                    integrated water resource development plans. The Rhine 
                    Action Plan has led to pollution control objectives that are 
                    to improve water quality to the point that sensitive species 
                    can once again live in the river. It is also aimed at 
                    reducing pollution to the North Sea. The 1909 Boundary 
                    Waters Treaty between Canada and the United States has led 
                    to a series of agreements over the sharing of waters and 
                    controls on pollution, particularly in the Great Lakes.

                    <LI>The need for a comprehensive legal instrument for 
                    international water bodies has been voiced by several 
                    countries. The Draft Articles of the Law of the 
                    Non-navigational uses of International Watercourses were 
                    adopted by the International Law Commission in 1994. The 
                    Commission recommend the elaboration of a convention by the 
                    General Assembly on the basis of the draft Articles. 
<BR><BR>
                    <LI>This report, like many others before it, has identified 
                    the river basin as the logical unit for water management, as 
                    any activity in one part will influence other parts of the 
                    basin, especially downstream. Thus, there is a clear need 
                    for cooperation in the management of international and 
                    transboundary watercourses to maximize mutual benefits for 
                    all riparian countries.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>5. Water needs to be considered as a 
                    resource having an economic value</P>
                    <LI>Water has economic value, and should be considered an 
                    economic as well as social good. Like any valuable 
                    commodity, water use has a cost either in terms of its 
                    development or foregone opportunities. The cost of using or 
                    misusing water does not disappear, but is paid either by the 
                    user or by the community at large or through a depletion of 
                    the existing natural capital. As water demands increase, it 
                    becomes more important to see that water is put to the 
                    high-valued economic uses. It is important to see that there 
                    is full cost accounting, full cost recovery for the 
                    provision of water, and that users pay for the water used 
                    for economic purposes. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>At the same time, it is essential for water planning to 
                    secure basic human and environmental needs for water. 
                    Otherwise, there will be a risk of shortages, which impose 
                    costs on society both in terms of health impacts and losses 
                    in economic performance. An example is Brazil which is 
                    undergoing social reform programmes, including in the water 
                    sector. The country still needs to settle some controversial 
                    issues, but the direction is toward a recognition of water 
                    as an economic good while also stressing that provision for 
                    human consumption must be given top priority. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>There is a need in many countries to begin or to 
                    continue a shift from the government from being the provider 
                    of water services to being the creator and regulator of an 
                    environment that allows involvement of communities, the 
                    private sector and non-governmental organizations in the 
                    provision of water supply and sanitation services as well as 
                    in the development and utilization of water in other sectors 
                    of the economy. Uganda is undergoing water reforms and is 
                    moving away from a centralized system to a system where 
                    communities will actively take part in the decision making 
                    and where choices of solution to water services will relate 
                    to local affordability and needs. Thus, the new Water Action 
                    Plan and Water Statue aim to facilitate a flexible and 
                    coherent water resources management at all levels in the 
                    society. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The introduction of water markets and pricing mechanisms 
                    can encourage the private sector to play an increasingly 
                    important role in providing the necessary financial 
                    resources and management skill needed for the successful 
                    development and utilization of the resources. Governments 
                    need to establish laws and regulations for the fair and 
                    efficient operation of water markets. Wherever subsidies or 
                    income transfers are deemed necessary for social or other 
                    national considerations, the objectives of such subsidies or 
                    transfers should be well defined and the incidence of the 
                    subsidy should not fall on the public or private utilities 
                    providing the service. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>It is essential that economic planning incorporate the 
                    idea of water as natural capital whose services can be 
                    depleted, as in using up groundwater or polluting water 
                    sources. Those services can only be restored at high cost. 
                    In the long run, a failure to include the state of water 
                    resources in economic analysis, particularly in 
                    macro-economic analysis, leads to unnecessary, wasteful and 
                    costly investments in water supply developments, 
                    mis-allocation of water resources among competing uses and, 
                    in some cases, to the actual collapse of schemes.

                    <LI>Capacity building is an essential step in preparing 
                    sustainable water strategies. It includes education, 
                    awareness-raising and the creation of a legal framework, 
                    institutions and an environment which enables people to take 
                    well-informed decisions for the long-term benefit of their 
                    society. Women, youth, non-governmental organizations and 
                    indigenous people need to be brought into capacity-building 
                    strategies, as they are essential in building a sustainable 
                    water future. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>If people, particularly in poor and water scarce 
                    countries are going to come up with solutions to problems 
                    such as how to attain food security, they must be educated 
                    and given access to the information that will help them make 
                    the decisions. The world needs more well-trained people, 
                    especially more women, to assess and develop fresh water 
                    supplies, and to manage water projects for sustainable use. 
                    Capacity building should be aimed at giving professionals 
                    from different backgrounds and working in different sectors 
                    the skills to effectively participate in the intersectoral 
                    dialogue during the planning, design and construction of 
                    water resources projects. There is further a need to create 
                    new or strengthen existing institutions capable of 
                    integrated water management and to build networks linking 
                    institutions with expertise in land, water quality and water 
                    quantity. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Many governments will need to assign a high priority to 
                    their capacity-building efforts towards institution 
                    building, legislation, and human resources development. 
                    National efforts in this regard need to be supported by 
                    international, regional and national external support 
                    agencies, and by the non-governmental community, including

                    <LI>Effective water resources assessment and management are 
                    not possible without adequate information, including 
                    hydrological information, water use and quality data, 
                    demographic data (separated by gender where relevant), 
                    forestry and land management, and capacity to assess the 
                    data. There is a need for national and internationally 
                    agreed upon and harmonized information systems that provide 
                    data needed for decision making, as well as common ways of 
                    analysing the information. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Ideally, the river basin or watershed should constitute 
                    the geographical unit for data collection and analysis. Even 
                    though some countries have hydrological data available, 
                    usually on river basin level, almost no country has 
                    socio-economic data sorted at a comparable level. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The experience with the current assessment demonstrates 
                    that the capability to provide accurate water quantity and 
                    quality data is sorely lacking in the majority of countries. 
                    For years, the capacity of hydrological offices in many 
                    developing countries, particularly in Africa, has been 
                    declining when it comes to the operation, maintenance and 
                    extension of hydrological networks. Few, if any, developing 
                    countries have a significant capability for water quality 
                    monitoring, which would give important information from a 
                    health perspective. It is very difficult to obtain reliable, 
                    systematic information on water resources management and 
                    irrigation in most developing countries. There is also poor 
                    data on land degradation related to water use. Even 
                    developed countries have been reducing their environmental 
                    monitoring systems as part of general budget cuts in recent 
                    years. Despite problems in finding resources for data 
                    gathering, there have been some encouraging signs. As part 
                    of the Southern African Development Community protocol on 
                    water resources, there was agreement to create a Water 
                    Sector dealing with integrated water planning and 
                    development of shared river basins. India's National Water 
                    policy calls for the development of a standardized national 
                    information system with multi-disciplinary units for water 
                    management. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Support from international, regional and national 
                    external support agencies is urgently needed. The WHYCOS 
                    programme, developed by WMO with support from the World Bank 
                    and other donors, is an important first step with regard to 
                    the strengthening of hydrological networks. The 
                    UNEP/WHO/GEMS water programme provides international support 
                    for the monitoring of water quality. The WHO/UNICEF Global 
                    Drinking Water Supply Monitoring Program collects and 
                    analysis information involving water supply and sanitation 
                    coverage in developing countries. FAO's AQUASTATs programme 
                    assembles information on rural water use in participating 
                    countries, and make it available in a standard format. 
                    UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme includes the 
                    FRIENDS (Flow Regimes of International Experimental and 
                    Network Data Sets) programme that places a strong emphasis 
                    on water resources management. Despite these important 
                    programmes, international support efforts concerning 
                    information management remain fragmented and incomplete.

                    <LI>Important action recommendations on global water issues

                    Safe Water and Sanitation for the 1990s in New Delhi, India, 
                    1990, to the International Conference on Water and the 
                    Environment in Dublin, and the United Nations Conference on 
                    Environment and Development, both in 1992. Further 
                    recommendations were provided by Interministerial Conference

                    Noordwijk, and by the Commission on Sustainable Development 
                    at its second session, both in 1994. Considerable progress 
                    has been achieved in some places in terms of implementing

                    of fresh water as a finite and vulnerable resource, and the 
                    integration of sectoral water plans and programmes within 
                    the framework of national economic and social policy.

                    <LI>Through a series of meetings, particularly the Dublin 
                    water conference, a set of principles, later reflected in 
                    chapter 18 of Agenda 21, for water planning and management 
                    have emerged and are gaining wide acceptance.
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>The Dublin Water Principles</B></P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem>Principle No. 1. Fresh water is a 
                    finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, 
                    development and the environment.</P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem>Principle No. 2. Water development and 
                    management should be based on a participatory approach, 
                    involving users, planners and policy-makers at all 
                    levels.</P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem>Principle No. 3. Women play a central 
                    part in the provision, management and safeguarding of 
                    water.</P>
                    <P class=clsTextItem>Principle No. 4. Water has an economic 
                    value in all its uses, and should be recognized as an 
                    economic good.</P>
                    <LI>The concept of water as an economic good needs to be 
                    implemented taking into account the provision of water for 
                    the satisfaction of basic needs. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Some important progress has been achieved in a number of 
                    countries in this regard. However, a much greater commitment 
                    to the implementation of these recommendations is needed 
                    world wide to achieve sustainability. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Governments should incorporate these important 
                    principles in their social, economic, and environmental 
                    planning. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem><B>C. Policy option for country 
                    categories</B></P>
                    <LI>Given many current trends, there is a risk that an 
                    increasing number of low income countries will find 
                    themselves facing water stress. Some countries may also have 
                    economic growth that will shift them to higher income 
                    categories, giving them financial means to develop suitable 
                    water strategies. It should be noted that some economic 
                    growth projections used by planners do not take into account 
                    water as a possible limiting factor in future economic 
                    development. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>As the pressure on water increases, so will the number 
                    of problems that countries must solve. For a country not to 
                    move to a position of higher water stress possibly with 
                    serious economic implications, certain actions must be 
                    taken, and most of them are urgent if they are not to suffer 
                    a decline in their human, economic and environmental health. 
                    <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Relatively small amounts of water per capita do not 
                    prevent development, but they do shape it. There are 
                    examples of countries that are coming to terms by using 
                    technology and economic strategies to live within their 
                    means. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>All countries need to implement the recommendations 
                    contained in the Rio Declaration and in chapter 18 of Agenda 
                    21 in the framework of their water management policies. They 
                    should also encourage demand management and pricing 
                    principles, as discussed above. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>At a time when development assistance funds are limited, 
                    it will be important to focus on assisting people who suffer 
                    from lack of funds to make use of their water resources. 
                    This must be done in a way that helps economic and social 
                    development without over exploiting water and other natural 
                    resources. After the provision for basic human needs, 
                    development projects in most countries need to focus on 
                    efficient use of water for relatively high value products. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>1. High income countries with low water 
                    stress</P>
                    <LI>Pollution reduction and control is the major 
                    water-related challenge facing most countries in this 
                    category. Many of them also need to look at the issue of 
                    water pricing, because the fact that water might be 
                    plentiful does not mean that it should be free. Development 
                    and distribution costs need to be covered by either public 
                    or private utilities. Some countries in this group, with 
                    favourable land and climate conditions, may have a 
                    significant potential for increased food production from 
                    irrigation and rainfed agriculture, and could play a 
                    significant role in providing food to world markets. 
<BR><BR>
                    <LI>Because of the average nature of the water availability 
                    and use, some large countries classified in this category 
                    nevertheless contain arid and semi-arid areas which would 
                    have to be considered as being highly stressed and 
                    vulnerable. In such regions, demand management measures and 
                    water rights markets are becoming critically important. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>2. High income countries with high 
                    water stress</P>
                    <LI>For those countries with low per capita water 
                    availability, the allocation of water to the highest value 
                    uses is a necessity. Demand management and water allocation 
                    policies designed to maximize the socio-economic value of 
                    water are of paramount importance, as is pollution control. 
                    Water markets with tradable water rights and permits are 
                    already beginning to play an important role in the 
                    allocation of water, and will need to continue to play an 
                    increasingly important role. With increased allocation 
                    efficiency, it is likely that irrigated agriculture will 
                    decrease in importance, and it appears that more countries 
                    in this category will become increasingly dependent on the 
                    world market for agricultural products. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The depletion of groundwater aquifers and sea-water 
                    intrusion needs to be avoided. The protection of surface and 
                    groundwater from pollution is vital. It is recommended that 
                    all countries in this category give urgent attention to 
                    pollution monitoring and control through economic and 
                    regulatory measures of both surface and groundwater. 
<BR><BR>
                    <LI>Waste water treatment and reuse will constitute 
                    essential mechanisms for pollution control and the 
                    augmentation of water supplies. For example, Israel already 
                    recycles and reuses two-thirds of the water discharged after 
                    urban and industrial use. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>3. Low income countries with low water 
                    stress</P>
                    <LI>Countries in this group that are well endowed with land 
                    and water resources may have the opportunity to increase 
                    agricultural production and exports into the world market 
                    either from irrigated or rainfed agriculture. For those 
                    countries with relative water scarcity, and high levels of 
                    evaporation, agricultural production is probably best 
                    directed into high-value, low water intensive products. Some 
                    poor countries lack adequate access to what little water 
                    they have, and development assistance could help them in 
                    using that water wisely. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Both water rich and water poor countries with low 
                    incomes generally suffer from a lack of sanitation and waste 
                    water treatment. Water pollution from human or animal wastes 
                    is often already a problem, and steps are needed now to 
                    improve pollution control and treatment to protect human and 
                    ecosystem health. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>The acceptance of highly polluting industries with 
                    little or no control on their discharges may be tempting on 
                    the basis of short-term economic growth considerations. 
                    However, the overall, long-term costs to redress 
                    environmental damages resulting from such decisions have 
                    often been shown to more expensive than creating 
                    low-polluting industries in the first place. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Countries are urged to give high priority to investments 
                    for waste water treatment and reuse, and to formulate and 
                    implement pollution monitoring and control policies.
                    <P class=clsTextItem>4. Low income countries with high water 
                    stress</P>
                    <LI>If appropriate action is not taken between now and 2025, 
                    the number of people in this category could grow 
                    substantially. Water resources will become a major limiting 
                    factor to socio-economic development unless early measures 
                    are taken towards restructuring production and consumption 
                    patterns away from wasteful and low value water intensive 
                    uses. There is evidence that some countries are already 
                    reaching this kind of developmental bottleneck. Achieving 
                    sustainable use of water resources for most countries in 
                    this category will require that per capita water use 
                    decrease as population increases. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Given the high ratio of water use to availability, 
                    population growth and future economic development will 
                    require shifts in the utilization of water towards the 
                    production of high value products. Under current trends, 
                    many of these countries will become less self sufficient in 
                    food production, and will have to rely on the world market 
                    for food imports. The economic transformation of these 
                    countries will need to be accompanied by social support 
                    programmes involving education and training of the labour 
                    force to enable it to cope with the demands of an 
                    increasingly industrialized society. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Countries in this category are urged to give the highest 
                    priority to the formulation of economic and regulatory 
                    measures designed to increase irrigation efficiency and 
                    optimize water allocation among various uses. In particular, 
                    they need to pay attention to the generation of foreign 
                    exchange that might be needed for food imports. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Countries should increase waste water treatment and 
                    reuse, and should control pollution from agricultural 
                    chemicals through land management and integrated pest 
                    management measures. <BR><BR>

                    <LI>Develop sustainable water strategies that address basic 
                    human needs, as well as the preservation of ecosystems, in 
                    ways that are consistent with socio-economic objectives of 
                    different societies. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Develop adequate national and regional water policies 
                    and plans, and promote cost-efficient water technologies. 
                    Water management must be integrated into physical, social 
                    and economic planning, including land use planning, forest 
                    resource utilization and protection of coastal zones from 
                    land based activities. Land and water use are closely 
                    intertwined. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Integrate water in economic planning analysis. Recognize 
                    water and the environment as vital capital. This means 
                    accounting for the value of water in each nation's system of 
                    national accounts. The accounts need to reflect the economic

                    <LI>Integrate the private sector into the water development 
                    process. While people must be provided with access to water 
                    for basic needs at affordable cost, the private sector can 
                    play a helpful role in seeing that water for a number of

                    questions. There is a need for people with expertise in

                    resolution, and people who can identify and help implement

                    expertise on dealing with the socio-economic aspects of 
                    water management, such as water pricing, and the role of the

                    ensure functional water markets and protection of water 
                    rights. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Establish, within existing institutions, especially the 
                    UN system, a global water information network to compile 
                    information with particular emphasis on water quality, 
                    quantity and water use. The institutions should also conduct 
                    regular global and regional water assessments. Water 
                    information programmes should be implemented at national 
                    level, and international institutions should propose models 
                    to ensure compatibility between data of individual 
                    countries. There is a need for a periodic review and it is 
                    recommended that the Commission on Sustainable Development 
                    carry out periodic global fresh water assessments, using the 
                    existing network of experts. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Build on international collaborative arrangements such 
                    as the Global Water Partnership, the Water Supply and 
                    Sanitation Collaborative Council, World Water Council, and 
                    strengthen collaboration with Non Governmental 
                    Organizations. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Develop north-south academic partnerships to develop the 
                    research capacity on a broad range of water-related issues, 
                    including those of quantity and quality and those related to 
                    helping people understand the value of water as natural 
                    capital. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Develop partnerships with the private sector and 
                    industries to take advantage of their expertise to achieve 
                    mutual benefits in the water sector. <BR><BR>
                    <LI>Given the seriousness of the situation and future risk 
                    of crises, there is an urgent need to act now. The 
                    international community has to strive for a situation in 
                    which there is no undermining of the natural resource base. 
                    Land and water need to be protected from long-term 
                    degradation that threatens food production, aquatic 
                    ecosystems, human health and biodiversity. There is a need 
                    to reduce water use per unit of production, using 
                    water-efficient technologies. Pollution has to be sharply 
                    reduced, and persistent toxic substances that accumulate in 
                    the food chain must no longer be released into the 
                    environment. Agricultural water use has to become highly 
                    efficient, so as to ensure an adequate food supply for 
                    everyone. Generally accepted political goals need to be 
                    developed based on the fair sharing of benefits from water 
                    use. 
                    <P class=clsTextItem>In order to achieve this future it is 
                    necessary for governments to take the steps needed to reach 
                    a Global Consensus over and above what is contained in the 
                    existing principles and agreements on freshwater resources 
                    of the world. Such a Consensus should take into account 
                    factors brought out in this report. </P></LI></OL><!-- End of the Left hand side text-->
