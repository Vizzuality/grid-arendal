            <P>Japan faced severe air pollution problems, especially in urban 
            centers, in the 1960s and 1970s. Considerable action was taken to 
            address these problems, and tremendous progress has been made. 
            Despite it's high energy efficiency, absolute CO2 emissions are 
            still high and demand special action.</P>
            <P>Compared to other countries, Japan's level of air pollution is 
            low. Its sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, both 
            per capita and per unit of GDP, are the lowest in the OECD. Its CO2 
            emissions are below the OECD average. Japan does receive <A 
            href="http://www.rri.org/envatlas/asia/japan/jp-intl.html#Regional">transboundary</A> 
            air pollution, especially SOx from Korea and <A 
            href="http://www.rri.org/envatlas/asia/china/cn-index.html">China</A>. 
            Wide-scale acid deposition damage has not yet occurred, though.</P>
            <P>Urban conditions have improved, especially due to high fuel 
            prices, technological advancements, and strict standards. Progress 
            on lead emissions, for example, has been dramatic. Distribution of 
            unleaded gasoline began in 1975. By 1987, leaded gas had been 
            completely eliminated from Japan.</P>
            <P><A name=Regulatory></A>Regulatory measures began as a reaction to 
            the heavy air pollution of the late 1960s. In 1967, the Basic Law 
            for Environmental Pollution Control set standards for five air 
            pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon 
            monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic 
            compounds (VOCs). The <A 
            href="http://www.rri.org/envatlas/asia/japan/jp-inst.html#with">Air 
            Pollution Control</A> <A name=Law></A>Law of 1968 set emission 
            standards for designated sources. These standards have been 
            constantly revised and are now some of the strictest in the world. 
            Establishment of effective standards was aided by Japan's excellent 
            monitoring system. This system was put in place by the Air Pollution 
            Control Law of 1974, which established an <STRONG>Area-Wide Total 
            Pollutant Load Control System.</STRONG></P>

            <H4><A name=Role></A>Role in Global Warming</H4>
            <P>Japan is extremely reliant on foreign energy sources. Its energy 
            supply is considered one of the most vulnerable among OECD 
            countries, and imports are needed to meet 84% of energy demand. The 
            oil crisis of the early 1970s greatly reduced the rate of growth in 
            energy use and prompted new policy initiatives prompting 
            conservation and greater national self-sufficiency.</P>
            <P>Japan is very energy efficient. Among OECD countries, it has one 
            of the lowest ratios of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic 
            product (GDP), as well as one of the lowest energy intensity rates 
            per capita (though this has grown rapidly since 1984). Japan has 
            shown that economic growth is not dependent on greater energy use. 
            Between 1979 and 1987, for example, the ratio of energy supply to 
            GDP fell by 25%. <!--OCR graphs from Env Perf Rev, p. 144--></P>
            <P>Yet,while consumption rates have slowed, overall emissions still 
            grow. This fact, coupled with the size of the Japanese economy, make 
            it a significant contributor to global greenhouse gases <!--link to OECD table of countries and CO2 emissions IEA update-->. 
            In 1992, for example, Japan produced 5.09% of the world's total CO2 
            emissions.</P>
            <H4>Goals</H4>
            <P>Japan ratified the UN <A 
            href="gopher://gopher.undp.org/00/unconfs/UNCED/English/climate">Framework 
            Convention on Climate Change</A> in May of 1993. Yet its national 
            policy on global warming predates UNCED by two years, having been 
            set in the <STRONG>1990 Action Program to Arrest Global 
            Warming</STRONG>. Some goals of the program are:</P>

            <P><STRONG>1990 Action Program to Arrest Global Warming:</STRONG> An 
            important component in Japan's climate policy was its recognition of 
            the need for greater integration in sectorial policies. To 
            accomplish this, the government established the <A 
            href="http://www.rri.org/envatlas/asia/japan/jp-mech.html#Charge">Council 
            of Ministers for Global Environment Conservation</A>. This body 
            approved the Action Program to Arrest Global Warming in 1990. In 
            addition to setting emission targets, the program also instituted 
            mechanisms for information-gathering and cooperation. These 
            include:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Research and monitoring of global warming, with special 
              emphasis on modeling possible changes in the Asia-Pacific region 
              <LI>Development and sharing of technology for energy conservation, 
              renewable energy and carbon fixation 
              <LI>International cooperation, especially the targeting of aid to 
              developing countries </LI></UL>
            <P>The council tracks the progress of the program and its emission 
            goals and publishes its findings in annual <A 
            name=reports></A>reports.</P>
            <P><STRONG>"New Earth 21" Action Program for the Twenty-First 
            Century</STRONG> was developed by MITI. It is a century-long 
            development plan to stop global warming which maps out targets and 
            technological goals through the next century. The report sets 
            specific targets for energy reduction in various economic sectors. 
            Its "Fourteen Proposals for a New Earth" include:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Revisions to the Law on Energy Conservation to promote 
              efficiency through tax incentives and energy savings plans for 
              industry (Japan does not have a carbon tax) 
              <LI>Promotion of nuclear and alternative energy sources, as well 
              as a greater role for natural gas 
              <LI>International cooperation, including aid for conservation and 
              clean coal technology as well as safety improvements for the 
              nuclear facilities of the former Soviet Union </LI></UL>
            <P>This century-long plan is divided into two fifty-year 
            components:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>The first fifty years is a transition period dedicated to 
              research and developing new technologies. This includes further 
              studies of global warming and carbon sinks, increases in energy 
              efficiency, development of alternative energy sources, land 
              reclamation and reforestation. 
              <LI>The second fifty years involves implementation of the new 
              technologies. The plan actually projects a levelling off and 
              eventual decrease in greenhouse gas concentrations in this period. 
              </LI></UL>
            <H4>Current Progress</H4>
            <P>Japan's previous success in reducing energy demand has been 
            considerable, yet there are signs that further progress is hampered 
            by both technological and economic forces. Given the tremendous 
            gains already achieved, it is questionable how much more can be 
            accomplished through technology fixes. However, there is still room 
            for some improvements in appliance standards and vehicle and 
            building efficiency.</P>
            <P>Low oil prices and a strong yen have made efficiency less 
            important from an economic perspective. They have also increased the 
            cost of labor relative to automation, which encourages increased use 
            of machinery and, therefore, greater energy demand. Unlike many 
            other countries, Japan does not use taxes to offset fluctuations in 
            world energy prices, and thus its industries are more inclined to 
            forgo efficiency measures when prices drop.</P>
            <H2><A name=Water></A>Water Management</H2>
            <P>Japan has high annual precipitation rates and abundant freshwater 
            resources. Many of its fast-moving mountain rivers have been 
            harnessed for hydroelectric power, and its numerous lakes are the 
            primary source of drinking water. The most pressing water concern in 
            Japan is improving its wastewater treatment systems. While 
            considerable progress has been made in some areas of pollution, 
            performance in other areas is still poor.</P>
            <P>Two environmental quality standards for water were set in 1970. 
            The first, for the protection of human health, concerns heavy metals 
            and toxic substances. The second, for conservation of the "living 
            environment," concerns organic pollution. Japan's performance on 
            water pollution could be summarized as considerable progress on the 
            first standard but little progress on the second.</P>
            <P>Pollution from heavy metals and toxics was extreme in the 1950s 
            and 1960s, and water pollution became one of the first important 
            concerns for the Japanese environmental administration. Standards 
            were set for the most dangerous substances, such as mercury and 
            PCBs, and these have largely been met. In 1991, all but 0.02% of 
            water samples met standards for heavy metals and toxics.</P>
            <P>Considerable improvement is still needed for organic pollution. 
            Eutrophication is damaging Tokyo Bay, Ise Bay and the Seto Inland 
            Sea, and untreated sewage is released into surface waters, including 
            drinking water sources like Lake Kasumigaura and Lake Biwa. Japan's 
            most pressing need is to expand sewage treatment services. In 1992, 
            only 35% of the population was connected to sewage systems, a very 
            low level compared to Japan's OECD counterparts. In the same period, 
            the United States had services for 74% of its population, and Great 
            Britain serviced 87%. Most of the sewage treatment capacity is 
            primitive as well. Only about 2.3 million of Japan's over 124 
            million inhabitants are served by advanced sewage treatment systems 
            capable of removing nitrogen and phosphorus compounds.</P>
            <P>Japan is taking action to improve waste water treatment. Its 
            target is to increase treatment service to 70% of the population by 
            the year 2000. A 1994 review conducted by the OECD was skeptical of 
            this goal, however. It projected that additional funding mechanisms, 
            such as pollution charges, would probably be needed to adequately 
            fund this expansion.</P>

            href="http://www.rri.org/envatlas/graphs/watercap.html">here</A> for 
            a comparison of Japan's investment on water quality compared to that 
            of other OECD countries.</P>
            <H2><A name=Waste></A>Waste Management</H2>
            <P>As a relatively small, densly-populated country, Japan's primary 
            concern on waste management is limitting the volume to be disposed 
            in landfills. This was stated cleary in public policy under the 
            <STRONG>Guidelines for Solid Waste Management</STRONG>, promulgated 
            by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1979. The guidelines state 
            that:" Given the difficulty of providing land or seaside areas for 
            refuse disposal sites, it will be necessary to limit the volume of 
            collected refuse designated for treatment or disposal."</P>
            <P>The guidelines provide three mechanisms for waste disposal:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"Recycling disgarded refuse into useable resources" 
              <LI>"Reusing such resources as much as possible" 
              <LI>"Treating or disposing of the unusable portion in an 
              environmentally sound manner" </LI></UL>
            <P>Japan has been very successful in reducing waste volume, 
            especially for municipal solid waste (MSW). In 1992, recycling rates 
            for waste paper, for example, were at 48% and those for glass were 
            49%. The 1991 <STRONG>Law Concerning the Promotion of the Use of 
            Recyclable Reources</STRONG>, furthermore, sets even higher targets 
            for recycling of paper, glass and other materials.</P>
            <P>The next step in reducing waste volume is incinceration. About 
            75% of MSW is incinerated, reducing its volume by 95%. While 
            incineration is a solution for waste management, its effect on air 
            quality may be troublesome. Incinerators must meet strict standards 
            for SOx and NOx emissions, but there are no regulations covering 
            dioxin, furons, PCBs and heavy metals. Guidelines based on best 
            available technology have been developed for these pollutants, but 
            they are not legally enforceable. Over 70% of Japan's incinerators 
            are modern, continuous combustion facilities to which the strictest 
            gudelines apply.</P>
            <P>Japan's progress in reducing waste volume is somewhat offset by 
            rapid increases in the amount of waste generated. From 1986 to 1989, 
            the volume of municipal waste increased by 4% annually, a growth 
            rate four-fold that of the pevious ten years. One reason for a 
            steady increase in waste generated may be that Japan offers little 
            economic incentives for households to reduce waste. User charges 
            only cover about 10% of waste handling costs.</P>
            <P>The situation of hazardous waste (termed "specially controlled 
            waste" in Japan) is hard to analyze. In comparison with other OECD 
            countries, Japan classifies a smaller ratio of its waste as 
            hazardous. The shipment and ultimate fate of hazardous wastes is 
            also unclear. A 1992 law on specially controlled waste did set up a 
            manifest system to track waste through all stages of shipment. This 
            system is relatively new, however, and no national accounting and 
            analysis system for manifests is currently in place.</P>

            <H2>Nature <A name=Conservation></A>Conservation</H2>
            <P>Japan has collected excellent data on conservation issues. The 
            best resource is its "Green Census," a national inventory conducted 
            by thousands of experts and citizen volunteers. The first census was 
            begun in 1973, and subsequent ones were completed in 1979, 1987, and 
            1992. The surveys show rapid changes in the Japanese environment 
            over the period covered.</P>
            <P>Land-use and vegetation cover has changed. Agricultural land has 
            decreased and urban areas have increased. Forest composition has 
            changed. Fourteen percent of natural forests have been lost, most of 
            them being replaced by plantation forests. Japan remains one of the 
            most heavily forested countries in the OECD, and the extraction 
            industry has declined in recent years. The cause is not so much 
            decreased consumption of wood, but increased imports of softwood and 
            tropical hardwood (Japan is the world's largest wood importer).</P>
            <P>Freshwater resources and coastlines have been severely altered. 
            Pollution of surface waters and coastal areas has often been severe. 
            Natural shorelines have been lost to development. Thirty percent of 
            lake shores have been developed; only 46% of the natural marine 
            coastline remains.</P>
            <P>Japan has considerable biodiversity. It is especially rich in 
            avian species; acccording to the "Red Book of Japan," over half the 
            vertebrates in the country are birds. Pollution, the alteration of 
            the natural habitat and devlopment threaten many species. The 
            following graph/table shows the status of different types of 
            vertebrates in Japan.<!--graph or table  from table 5.1, p. 78, Env Perf Rev of Japan--></P>
            <P>Conservation policy is handled by several government bodies. The 
            Environment Agency, though its <STRONG>Nature Conservation 
            Bureau</STRONG>, has ultimate responsibility for conservation 
            policy. It also administers national parks, wilderness areas and 
            nature conservation areas. the <STRONG>Ministry of Agriculture, 
            Forestry and Fisheries</STRONG> administers forest reserves, and 
            forests important for soil and water conservation and for scenic 
            beauty. The <STRONG>Agency for Cultural Affairs</STRONG> can also 
            provide protection by designating certain plants, animals, or 
            landscapes as "natural monuments." The main legislation on 
            conservation is the <A

            Conservation Law of 1972</A>. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
