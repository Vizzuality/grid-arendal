<H3>WHAT IS THE GREAT LAKES WATER QUALITY AGREEMENT?</H3></CENTER>
<P>The Agreement, first signed in 1972 and renewed in 1978, expresses the 
commitment of each country to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and 
biological integrity of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem and includes a number of 
objectives and guidelines to achieve these goals. It reaffirms the rights and 
obligation of Canada and the United States under the Boundary Waters Treaty and 
has become a major focus of Commission activity. 
<P>In 1987, a Protocol was signed amending the 1978 Agreement. The amendments 
aim to strengthen the programs, practices and technology described in the 1978 
Agreement and to increase accountability for their implementation. Timetables 
are set for implementation of specific programs. 
<P>The Parties will meet biennially to discuss progress and report periodically 
to the Commission. New annexes address atmospheric deposition of toxic 
pollutants, contaminated sediments, groundwater, and nonpoint sources of 
pollution. Annexes are also added to incorporate the development and 
implementation of remedial action plans for Areas of Concern and lakewide 
management plans to control critical pollutants. 
<P>The Commission monitors and assesses progress under the Agreement and advises 
Governments on matters related to the quality of the boundary waters of the 
Great Lakes system. The Agreement also calls upon the Commission to assist the 
Governments with joint programs under the Agreement, and provides for two 
binational boards -- the Great Lakes Water Quality Board and the Great Lakes 
Science Advisory Board -- to advise the Commission.

<P><I>The Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
Canada,</I> 
<P><I>REAFFIRMING their commitment to achieving the purpose and objectives of 
the 1978 Agreement between the United States of America and Canada on Great

<P><I>HAVING developed and implemented cooperative programs and measures to

<P><I>RECOGNIZING the need for strengthened efforts to address the continuing 
contamination of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem, particularly by persistent

<P><I>ACKNOWLEDGING that many of these toxic substances enter the Great Lakes 
System from air, from ground water infiltration, from sediments in the Lakes and 
from the runoff of non-point sources;</I> 
<P><I>AWARE that further research and program development is now required to 
enable effective actions to be taken to address the continuing contamination of 
the Great Lakes;</I> 
<P><I>DETERMINED to improve management processes for achieving Agreement

<H3>AGREEMENT BETWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON GREAT LAKES 
QUALITY, 1978</H3></A>
<P>The Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America, 
<P>HAVING in 1972 and 1978 entered into Agreements on Great Lakes Water Quality; 

<P>REAFFIRMING their determination to restore and enhance water quality in the 
Great Lakes System; 
<P>CONTINUING to be concerned about the impairment of water quality on each side 
of the boundary to an extent that is causing injury to health and property on 
the other side, as described by the International Joint Commission; 
<P>REAFFIRMING their intent to prevent further pollution of the Great Lakes 
Basin Ecosystem owing to continuing population growth, resource development and 
increasing use of water; 
<P>REAFFIRMING in a spirit of friendship and cooperation the rights and 
obligations of both countries under the Boundary Waters Treaty, signed on 
January 11, 1909, and in particular their obligation not to pollute boundary 
waters; 
<P>CONTINUING to recognize that right of each country in the use of the Great 
Lakes waters; 
<P>HAVING decided that the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreements of 1972 and 1978 
and subsequent reports of the International Joint Commission provide a sound 
basis for new and more effective cooperative actions to restore and enhance 
water quality in the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem; 
<P>RECOGNIZING that restoration and enhancement of the boundary waters cannot be 
achieved independently of other parts of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem with 
which these waters interact; 
<P>CONCLUDING that the best means to preserve the aquatic ecosystem and achieve 
improved water quality throughout the Great Lakes System is by adopting common 
objectives, developing and implementing cooperative programs and other measures, 
and assigning special responsibilities and functions to the International Joint 
Commission;
