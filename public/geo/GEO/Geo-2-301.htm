    vspace=10 width=160><EM>Poverty is an important social issue because it 
    affects the development prospects of children and adults.</EM> How a society 
    distributes its income is a fundamental determinant of social cohesion. 
    People left on the fringes economically also tend to be on the fringes 
    socially. The many debilitating effects of poverty on child development and 
    adult well-being are well documented. 
    <P>
    <H3>Measuring Poverty</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI><EM>The choice of poverty lines ranges from those providing for bare 
      physical subsistence (the "absolute" approach) to those providing full 
      inclusion in society (the "relative" approach).</EM> There are many 
      working definitions of poverty, but no official version. All poverty lines 
      are based on subjective factors and their usage depends on their 
      credibility and public acceptability. 
      <P>For over 30 years, the leading poverty line in Canada has been 
      Statistics Canada's Low Income Cut-offs (LICOs). These cut-offs are by far 
      the most popular with the public, analysts and organizations dealing with 
      poverty and income distribution issues. The LICOs are not without 
      legitimate criticisms, but the competitor lines have more flaws and less 
      acceptability. The LICOs have also been repeatedly supported over time by 
      public opinion surveys and empirical research showing that the most 
      serious negative impacts of low income start to abate when family income 
      approaches the income levels that correspond with the low income cut-offs 
      (Chapter 2). 
      <P>
      <H3>Poverty has Risen</H3>
      <LI><EM>Household poverty has increased in Canada over the past 
      quarter-century.</EM> The rate of household poverty, as measured by 
      Statistics Canada's LICO, was higher in 1997 (22.4 per cent) than it was 
      in 1989, 1981 and 1973. This translates into an increase of 1.3 million 
      poor households since 1973 (Table 3.1). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Average household incomes, before and after income transfers and 
      taxes, have not recovered from the recession of the early 1990s.</EM> 
      Average household incomes in 1997 were lower than in 1981 (Table 3.3). 
      Moreover, the distribution of income has become more polarized between 
      low- and high-income households. As well, middle-income groups have 
      experienced a declining share of market and disposable income (Table 
      3.10). 
      <P>
      <H3>Seniors' Poverty Rates have Declined</H3>
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>While too many of Canada's senior citizens are still poor, their 
      poverty rate continued to decline between 1981 and 1997</EM> (Table 3.1). 
      The poverty rate among elderly households dropped by 7.2 percentage points 
      between 1981 and 1989 and another 1.8 percentage points between 1989 and 
      1997. In contrast, the poverty rate among working-age households increased 
      by 6.3 percentage points over this time period. 
      <P>Although the authors applaud the reduction in the rate of poverty among 
      elderly households, <EM>two cautions must be raised</EM>: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Despite gains, the rate of poverty among unattached elderly 
        individuals remains high, at 45.0 per cent in 1997 (Table 3.2). As well, 
        the poverty rate among elderly households has a pronounced gender bias. 
        In 1997, 49.1 per cent of unattached elderly females were living in 
        poverty compared to 33.3 per cent of elderly males. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Many elderly households have only been barely lifted above the 
        poverty lines through a combination of federal elderly benefits. Thus, 
        it should not be inferred from the improved poverty figures that the 
        elderly are comfortably off. In fact, a large segment of the non-poor 
        are nearly poor. </LI></UL>
      <P>
      <H3>Young Families are More Likely to be Poor</H3>
      <LI><EM>Poverty has been increasing dramatically among young 
      families.</EM> In 1981, a young family (in which the oldest adult is under 
      age 25) faced a 21.7 per cent chance of being poor; by 1997, this chance 
      had more than doubled to 46.1 per cent. Poverty rates among young families 
      in the next oldest age group are higher as well: among those aged 25 to 34 
      years, the rate of poverty increased from 12.0 per cent in 1981 to 18.9 
      per cent in 1997 (Table 4.3). 
      <P>
      <H3>The Regional and Provincial Distribution of Poverty has Shifted</H3>
      <LI><EM>In 1981, 12.3 per cent of all poor Canadian families lived in the 
      Atlantic provinces, but this share dropped to 8.8 per cent in 1997</EM> 
      (Table 4.1). In Alberta and British Columbia, during the same period, the 
      share of all poor families increased from 14.8 per cent to 20.9 per cent. 
      Much of this change occurred in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the share of poor 
      families rose the most in Ontario: increasing by 7.2 percentage points. 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>With the exception of Alberta and British Columbia, the poverty 
      rate among provinces was stable or declined between 1981 and 1989.</EM> In 
      the 1990s, however, this trend was reversed and many provinces experienced 
      an increase in their rates of poverty. In 1989, for example, Ontario had 
      the lowest rate of family poverty by a substantial margin at 8.2 per cent. 
      By 1997, the rate had climbed to 12.6 per cent, an increase of over 50 per 
      cent (Table 4.3). 
      <P>
      <H3>The Vulnerability of Children and Lone-parent Mothers has 
      Increased</H3>
      <LI><EM>Poverty strikes hardest at children, the most vulnerable members 
      of society and the least able to defend themselves.</EM> The child poverty 
      rate increased from 14.9 per cent in 1981 to 19.9 per cent in 1997 (Table 
      4.6). In 1997, there were 1.4 million poor children in Canada. Although 
      over half (54.6 per cent) of all poor children live in two-parent 
      families, the trend is toward more poor children living in lone-parent 
      households. In 1981, 32.8 per cent of all poor children lived in 
      lone-parent families; by 1997, this figure had risen to 43.2 per cent. 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>The exceptional circumstances of lone-parent mothers must be 
      underlined.</EM> Among these families, the rate of poverty was 53.5 per 
      cent in 1981. Over the next decade and a half, the poverty rate hovered 
      between 55 and 60 per cent, reflecting the ups and downs of the business 
      cycle. In 1997, it was 56.0 per cent, while the share of all poor 
      households composed of lone-parent mothers had increased to 28.4 per cent, 
      up from 22.5 per cent in 1981 (Table 4.1). 
      <P>
      <H3>Minority Groups Face Higher Poverty Rates</H3>
      <LI><EM>Some of the highest rates of poverty are found among Aboriginal 
      peoples, members of visible minority groups and persons with 
      disabilities.</EM> According to the 1996 Census, 43.4 per cent of 
      Aboriginal people, 35.9 per cent of visible minorities and 30.8 per cent 
      of persons with disabilities were poor in 1995. These rates were 
      significantly higher than the national average (Tables 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10). 

      <P>
      <H3>The Market has Failed to Generate Adequate Incomes</H3>
      <LI><EM>Increased poverty rates for working-age households reflect in 
      large part the failure of market income to provide living wages to all 
      Canadian households.</EM> The number of working-poor households, those 
      where one or more income earners were employed for at least 49 weeks, 
      increased substantially between 1981 and 1997 (Table 5.1). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>If market earnings only are considered, almost 1.6 million 
      Canadian working-age families would have been poor in 1997, compared to 
      1.1 million poor families after government transfers have been taken into 
      account.</EM> The rate of market poverty increased from 14.7 per cent in 
      1981 to 21.9 per cent in 1997 (Table 5.4). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Higher rates of market poverty highlight the inferior performance 
      of earnings.</EM> Families have responded by sending more earners into the 
      labour market. Among working-age households, the number of earners 
      increasingly distinguishes poor from non-poor households. In 1997, only 
      18.6 per cent of poor two-adult households contained two earners compared 
      to 67.0 per cent of non-poor two-adult households (Table 5.8). 
      <P><EM>The incomes of female spouses continue to play a key role in 
      sustaining families.</EM> In 1997, women in non-poor families were almost 
      five times more likely to have worked full-time/full-year than their poor 
      counterparts (47.2 per cent compared to 9.9 per cent). But it is not only 
      women's employment that sets non-poor apart from poor (Table 5.9). 
      <P><EM>Increasingly, the employment activity of men distinguishes poor 
      couples from non-poor couples.</EM> Among poor couples, only 29.1 per cent 
      of men were employed full-time/full-year compared to 77.5 per cent of 
      non-poor male partners (Table 5.9). 
      <P>
      <H3>Education is Still Key to Escaping Poverty </H3>
      <LI><EM>Along with number of earners, level of education is an important 
      factor distinguishing poor from non-poor households. The higher the level 
      of education, the lower the likelihood of having a low income.</EM> This 
      was as true in 1981 as it is today. In 1997, only 7.7 per cent of families 
      with an adult university graduate were poor, compared to 20.5 per cent of 
      those families in which the highest level of an adult member's education 
      was less than nine years of schooling (Table 4.3). It should be noted, 
      however, that over time the proportion of poor having higher educational 
      credentials has increased: the share of poor families having a 
      post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree has more than doubled from 
      13.5 per cent in 1981 to 32.6 per cent in 1997 (Table 4.1). 
      <P>
      <H3>Poor Falling Further Below the LICO</H3>
      <LI><EM>The depth of poverty - how far below the poverty line a poor 
      person's total income falls - has increased dramatically.</EM> Between 
      1981 and 1997, the poverty gap for all poor households almost doubled 
      (86.4 per cent). If only market income is considered, the market poverty 
      gap grew by 96.0 per cent over the same period, an increase of $27.3 
      billion (Table 6.1 and Table 6.5). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Working-age households, in particular, have experienced the 
      greatest economic difficulties.</EM> Their market poverty gap grew by 
      113.0 per cent and the total poverty gap (market and transfer income 
      combined) grew by 106.1 per cent. The largest increases occurred in the 
      period between 1989 and 1997. If government transfers had not increased 
      between 1981 and 1997, the poverty gap would have been much larger. 
      <P>
      <H3>Duration of Poverty Varies for Different Groups</H3>
      <LI><EM>The percentage of poor people who enter poverty one year, but 
      escape the next, varies.</EM> For roughly 60 per cent, poverty proves to 
      be a temporary situation, while it is a recurrent problem for the 
      remaining 40 per cent. On average, a poor individual will spend 
      approximately five years in poverty after counting both single and 
      multiple spells, while five per cent will stay in poverty for 10 or more 
      years (Chapter 7). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Certain groups are more vulnerable to lengthy spells of 
      poverty.</EM> These groups include lone parents, persons with 
      disabilities, members of visible minority groups, recent immigrants, 
      individuals with low levels of education, and unattached individuals. The 
      longer one remains in poverty, the more difficult it is to escape (Chapter 
      7). 
      <P>
      <H3>Government Transfers Grow in Importance</H3>
      <LI><EM>Government transfers have come to play an increasingly important 
      role in sustaining low-income households.</EM> The failure of labour 
      markets to provide employment opportunities and living wages to a large 
      number of people has highlighted the importance of Canada's income 
      security system. Households in the bottom two quintiles - with market 
      incomes under $23,473 - received only 7.9 per cent of market income but 
      64.9 per cent of all transfer income in 1997 (Table 8.1). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Reliance on government transfers has increased over time.</EM> In 
      1981, transfers made up 38.2 per cent of total income for households in 
      the lowest income quintiles; by 1997, transfers made up 90.0 per cent of 
      total income for these households (Table 8.2). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>The benefits of various income security programs are distributed 
      differently among different population groups.</EM> The highly targeted 
      Child Tax Benefit program delivered 64.9 per cent of benefits to the 
      bottom 40 per cent of families with dependent children in 1997 (Table 
      8.4). The benefit package for seniors had a more modest redistributive 
      effect: 46.6 per cent of benefits of OAS/GIS/SpA went to the bottom 40 per 
      cent of senior households in 1997 (Table 8.5). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Contributory social insurance programs tend to benefit 
      middle-income households.</EM> The Canada and Quebec Pension Plans deliver 
      31.2 per cent of benefits to the poorest 40 per cent of seniors, 
      reflecting the unequal earnings' history of retirees. The Employment 
      Insurance program is the most neutral in its effect on the income 
      distribution of working-age households; each quintile received a roughly 
      equivalent share of program benefits (Table 8.6). 
      <P>
      <H3>Canada's Anti-poverty Performance Remains Weak</H3>
      <LI><EM>Rates of poverty in Canada are high in comparison to many other 
      advanced industrial countries despite a reduction in the overall rate of 
      poverty over time.</EM> Canada's overall rate of poverty - the proportion 
      of the population living on disposable incomes amounting to 50 per cent or 
      less of median income - has declined from 12.5 in the late 1970s to 10.6 
      per cent in the mid-1990s (Table 9.1). In large part, the decline in the 
      overall poverty rate is related to the improved economic situation of 
      seniors. 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>High levels of poverty among children and the working-age 
      population kept poverty rates from declining further.</EM> In the 
      mid-1990s, using a standard international measure, 13.9 per cent of 
      children were impoverished in Canada. Children in the United States were 
      much more likely to live in poverty compared to children in other 
      countries (22.7 per cent), while Swedish children were much less likely to 
      do so (2.7 per cent) (Table 9.2). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Among working-age households with children in 12 industrialized 
      countries, Canada's rate of poverty ranks very high in several 
      categories.</EM> For example: Canada's poverty rate for these households 
      ranks second highest among two-parent households with no wage earner 
      present; third highest among lone-parent families; and fourth highest 
      among two-parent households where there are one or two wage earners (Table 
      9.3). 
      <P></P>
      <LI><EM>Income transfers and tax policy have an important impact on a 
      country's poverty rate.</EM> In all countries, taxes and transfers reduce 
      the rate of poverty based on market incomes alone. Among industrialized 
      countries, Canadian income supports for seniors - as well as those in 
      Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Italy - produce a notable reduction in 
      poverty (Table 9.5). 
      <P>In contrast, English-speaking countries including Canada provide 
      comparatively little support to children and working-age adults as 
      measured by reduction in poverty rates. Countries with high rates of 
      market-based poverty like Canada tend to have lower rates of poverty 
      reduction. </P></LI></UL>
