<P>How are we doing?</P></I></B>
<P>Although our region has 1,793,400 acres (57.8% of 3,103,900 total acres in 
California and Oregon) of old-growth and 1,170,700 acres (42% of 2,793,500 total 
acres) of late-successional forests, the trend has been toward an overall 
decrease in acreage and fragmentation of remaining stands. For example, in the 
Siskiyou National Forest (Oregon), there was a 24% acreage decrease between 1981 
and 1988, from 185,000 acres to 141,000 acres. Of these remaining acres, 66,000 
were in fragmented landscapes, in which old-growth stands were less than 400 
acres in size and surrounded by clearcuts, plantations, and non-forested 
areas.</P><B><I>
<P>Why is this important?</P></I></B>
<P>Acreage of old-growth forest is a positive indicator of natural capital. Loss 
of the relative abundance, diversity, and distribution of old-growth communities 
leading to fragmentation of remaining stands, as well as the negative 
externalities of logging--such as road failures and increased runoff and 
sedimentation--can have a potentially devastating effect on natural capital—both 
of the natural resource stock (i.e., depletion of fisheries, loss of viable 
old-growth dependent species) and environmental services (such as water 
quality). Human capital could also be negatively impacted, as ancient forests 
are a rich resource for furthering our knowledge of the interrelationships of 
ecological systems, and their loss would diminish that ability. Ecotourism 
prospects and related opportunities for created capital could be impaired. 
Social and cultural capital would likely be affected as well, since ancient 
forests have proved to be a mechanism for spurring volunteerism and defining the 
culture of surrounding communities.</P></BODY></HTML>
