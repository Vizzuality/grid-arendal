<H1>Death in a glass of water</H1>
<H2>Scientists believe up to 30 million people in Bangladesh could be drinking 
water contaminated with lethal doses of arsenic. Who is to blame?</H2>
<H3>By Fred Pearce</H3>
<H4>19 January 2001</H4>
<P>British researchers are among those accused of failing to spot concentrations 
of arsenic in what UN scientists believe is "the largest mass poisoning of a 
population in history". Geologists analysing water in newly-sunk wells in 
Bangladesh nine years ago for the British government failed to spot high 
concentrations of arsenic, now thought to be poisoning millions of Bangladeshis. 
The study was designed "to assess the... possible toxicity of groundwater to 
humans". But according to a British geologist who has analysed the Bangladesh 
tragedy, John McArthur, professor of geochemistry at University College London, 
the researchers did not rigorously follow World Health Organisation's guidelines 
and check for the metal.</P>
<P>The arsenic is thought to be present at dangerous levels in between two and 
five million of the 10 million wells sunk across Bangladesh over the past 25 
years - many of them by international aid agencies, including the official aid 
arm of the British Government. Some wells pump up water that exceeds the safety 
limits a hundredfold or more.</P>
<P>In some villages today, the majority of the population suffers from the early 
symptoms of poisoning, such as ulcerous growths on their skin. The final stages 
bring gangrene and cancers. With the majority of the country's 68,000 villages 
potentially at risk, UN scientists estimate that the arsenic may soon be killing 
20,000 Bangladeshis a year.</P>
<P>Among those whom it is claimed failed to spot the arsenic were scientists 
working for the British Geological Survey on a water-quality survey of central 
and northeastern Bangladesh, funded by the British Government's Overseas 
Development Administration, which has since been renamed the Department For 
International Development. They surveyed water from 150 tubewells - mechanically 
drilled boreholes - at different depths. They included samples from areas where 
more than three-quarters of wells used for drinking are now known to contain 
concentrations of arsenic that are lethal if drunk regularly, says Professor 
McArthur. But arsenic was not among the 22 parameters tested.</P>
<P>"They did not find arsenic because they did not look for it, even though 
there were routine, well-established techniques for doing so," says Professor 
McArthur. "They should have analysed for all the trace elements in the WHO 
guidelines - and that included arsenic."</P>
<P>Denis Peach, head of groundwater at the BGS, told <I>The Independent</I> this 
week: "It is true that arsenic was one of the many parameters in the WHO 
guidelines. But it was and remains common practice not to measure all the [WHO] 
determinands on the list for reasons of cost and/or availability of 
facilities."</P>
<P>He says at the time of the survey, arsenic "was not widely thought to be a 
problem in groundwaters". Certainly, "BGS staff can vouch for the fact that at 
that time no one there was talking about arsenic... In retrospect we, and 
others, made a mistake."</P>
<P>Professor McArthur accepts that the BGS had no special reason to suspect 
arsenic. But he claims "arsenic is often associated with iron in water - and 
they knew there was iron". Bangladeshis have reason to feel let down, he says. 
"The BGS are regarded as experts. If they said the water was safe, it would be 
seen as safe."</P>
<P>The fact that the arsenic remained undetected led to a delay of five years in 
the uncovering of a public-health disaster worse than Chernobyl or Bhopal. The 
survey took place eight years after the WHO had set formal international 
standards for arsenic in water supplies, but occurred in the months before the 
WHO toughened standards further because of growing concern, particularly in the 
US.</P>
<P>Studies round the world in the 1990s have shown arsenic to be widely present 
in underground water. It is now believed to be a major cause of cancer.</P>
<P>Through the early years of the tubewell programme, scientists grew concerned 
about the lack of proper analysis of water quality by the Bangladeshi government 
and aid agencies. British engineering consultants Mott MacDonald reported that 
the available data left "a lot to be desired". Studies by aid agencies were 
intended to help improve things. But it turns out to have given engineers a 
false sense of security. With the water given the all-clear, doctors failed to 
implicate it in unexplained cases of arsenic poisoning seen in increasing 
numbers since 1987.</P>
<P>Dangerous levels of arsenic are believed to be present in between a quarter 
and a half of the country's estimated 10 million tube wells. It is naturally 
present in the delta muds beneath most of the country.</P>
<P>Scientists still dispute why it dissolves into the water in such quantities. 
Tragically, the arsenic is concentrated at between 20 and 100 metres below the 
surface - just the depth to which most wells were sunk. Deeper wells would have 
been safe.</P>
<P>Most of the wells were sunk during the 1980s' UN World Water Decade by 
agencies such as Unicef, the UN children's agency, which inaugurated the 
programme and itself sunk 900,000 wells. The aim was to convert Bangladesh from 
a country reliant on often polluted surface waters to one drinking "safe" 
underground water. Aid agencies hoped to reduce the death rate from diseases 
such as cholera and dysentery, and in that they succeeded: the wells have helped 
halve Bangladesh's infant mortality rate. But the gain appears to have been at 
the expense of visiting horrific diseases on those same children in 
adulthood.</P>
<P>Unicef stands by its tubewell programme. "At the time, standard procedures 
for testing the safety of groundwater did not include tests for arsenic, which 
had never before been found in the kind of geological formations that exist in 
Bangladesh," it said.</P>
<P>In a separate development, <I>The Independent</I> has established that 
international efforts launched more than two years ago to staunch the flow of 
arsenic in Bangladesh's tubewells is close to collapse, with little more than 1 
per cent of villages surveyed so far. The two findings add to a growing sense 
that foreign agencies could have done more to avert the tragedy.</P>
<P>In August 1998, following reports that as many as 30 million people could be 
drinking lethal water, the World Bank and Bangladesh government announced a 
three-year crash programme to survey an initial 4,000 villages and draw up 
action plans to replace the poisoned wells. It was just the beginning of what 
the Bank promised would be a massive 15-year campaign to eliminate arsenic from 
millions of wells in the country's 68,000 villages.</P>
<P>But today Bank officials say only 800 villages have been tested, and few 
action plans have been drawn up. Richard Wilson of Harvard University's 
department of public health, a leading analyst of the crisis, says "the project 
is stalled". Wilson says the Bangladeshi government cannot decide how to spend 
the $44m on offer and says bank officials have been deeply troubled by the 
failure.</P>
<P>Bangladeshi officials in turn criticise Western organisations, accusing them 
of wanting to spend the money on foreign consultants, and of trying to bypass 
national technical committees. As the bureaucrats bicker, the task they face 
appears ever more daunting. In recent months, says the Bank's Dhaka water 
specialist Khawaja Minnatullah, scientists have doubled the estimate of the 
number of tubewells in the country that will need surveying from 5 to 10 
million.</P>
<P>Whatever the precise mechanism involved, one solution would clearly be to 
sink all tubewells to depths greater than 100 metres. Had that been done in the 
first place, Bangladeshis would today be drinking safe water.</P><!-- mini index --><!-- <h3 class="Independentcolor">Also from the null section</h3>
