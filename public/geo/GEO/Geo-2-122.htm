<H1>Dams and Development:<BR>A New Framework for Decision-Making</H1>
<H4>The Report of the World Commission on Dams</H4>
<H3>An Overview - November 16 2000</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.dams.org/">http://www.dams.org/</A></P>
<H2>The Commission</H2>
<P>In April 1997, with support from the World Bank and IUCN-The World 
Conservation Union, representatives of diverse interests met in Gland, 
Switzerland, in light of a recent World Bank report, to discuss highly 
controversial issues associated with large dams. The workshop brought together 
39 participants from governments, the private sector, international financial 
institutions, civil society organisations and affected people. One proposal that 
came out of the meeting was for all parties to work together in establishing the 
World Commission on Dams (WCD) with a mandate to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>review the development effectiveness of large dams and assess alternatives 
  for water resources and energy development; and 
  <LI>develop internationally acceptable criteria, guidelines and standards, 
  where appropriate, for the planning, design, appraisal, construction, 
  operation, monitoring and decommissioning of dams</LI></UL>
<P>The WCD began its work in May 1998 under the Chairmanship of Prof. Kader 
Asmal, who was then South Africa's Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry; its 
members were chosen to reflect regional diversity, expertise and stakeholder 
perspectives.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The WCD was independent, with each member serving in an individual 
  capacity and none representing an institution or a country 
  <LI>The Commission conducted the first comprehensive global and independent 
  review of the performance and impacts of large dams, and the options available 
  for water and energy development 
  <LI>Public consultation and access to the Commission was a key component of 
  the process. The WCD Forum, with 68 members representing a cross-section of 
  interests, views and institutions, was consulted throughout the Commission's 
  work 
  <LI>The WCD pioneered a new funding model involving all interest groups in the 
  debate: 53 public, private and civil society organisations pledged funds to 
  the WCD process</LI></UL>
<P>The final report of the World Commission on <I>Dams, Dams and Development: A 
New Framework for Decision-Making</I>, was released in November 2000. </P>
<P><B>This overview document</B> provides a highly condensed summary of <I>Dams 
and Development</I>. We urge readers to refer to the relevant sections in the 
full report to capture both context and nuances of the findings and 
recommendations. The full report also includes a detailed list of 
acknowledgements that could not be reproduced here, as well as a comment note by 
Medha Patkar.</P>
<H2>The WCD Commissioners</H2>
<P>Extensive consultation with all interested groups resulted in invitations to 
eminent persons to serve as members of the World Commission on Dams. </P>
<P>They were selected on the basis of their wide-ranging backgrounds, views, and 
the expertise they bring to the debate, with the Secretary General appointed an 
ex-officio member of the Commission. </P>
<P>The Commissioners collectively were responsible for fulfilling the terms of 
the WCD mandate. The Commission's work was advisory in nature and not 
investigatory. Unlike a judicial commission, the WCD was not set up to 
adjudicate on specific disputes.</P>

<H2>The WCD Report - In Brief</H2>
<P>The WCD report is a milestone in the evolution of dams as a development 
option. The debate about dams is a debate about the very meaning, purpose and 
pathways for achieving development. Through its Global Review of the performance 
of dams, the Commission presents an integrated assessment of when, how and why 
dams succeed or fail in meeting development objectives. This provides the 
rationale for a fundamental shift in options assessment and in the planning and 
project cycles for water and energy resources development.</P>
<P>The Commission's framework for decision-making is based on five core values - 
equity, sustainability, efficiency, participatory decision-making and 
accountability. It proposes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>a rights-and-risks approach as a practical and principled basis for 
  identifying all legitimate stakeholders in negotiating development choices and 
  agreements 
  <LI>seven strategic priorities and corresponding policy principles for water 
  and energy resources development - gaining public acceptance, comprehensive 
  options assessment, addressing existing dams, sustaining rivers and 
  livelihoods, recognising entitlements and sharing benefits, ensuring 
  compliance, and sharing rivers for peace, development and security; and 
  <LI>criteria and guidelines for good practice related to the strategic 
  priorities, ranging from life-cycle and environmental flow assessments to 
  impoverishment risk analysis and integrity pacts. </LI></UL>
<P>The Commission's rationale and recommendations offer scope for progress that 
no single perspective can offer on its own. They will ensure that 
decision-making on water and energy development:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>reflects a comprehensive approach to integrating social, environmental and 
  economic dimensions of development 
  <LI>creates greater levels of transparency and certainty for all involved; and 

  <LI>increases levels of confidence in the ability of nations and communities 
  to meet their future water and energy needs</LI></UL>
<H2><I>Dams and Development</I> -- An Introduction</H2>
<P>Dams have been built for thousands of years - dams to manage flood waters, to 
harness water as hydropower, to supply water to drink or for industry, or to 
irrigate fields. By 1950, governments, or in some countries the private sector, 
were building increasing numbers of dams as populations increased and national 
economies grew. At least 45 000 large dams have been built as a response to meet 
an energy or water need. Today nearly half of the world's rivers have at least 
one large dam.</P>
<P>As we start the new century, one-third of the countries in the world rely on 
hydropower for more than half their electricity supply, and large dams generate 
19% of electricity overall. Half the world's large dams were built exclusively 
or primarily for irrigation, and some 30-40% of the 271 million hectares 
irrigated worldwide rely on dams. Dams have been promoted as an important means 
of meeting perceived needs for water and energy services and as long-term, 
strategic investments with the ability to deliver multiple benefits. Some of 
these additional benefits are typical of all large public infrastructure 
projects, while others are unique to dams and specific to particular projects. 
</P>
<P>Regional development, job creation, and fostering an industry base with 
export capability are most often cited as additional considerations for building 
large dams. Other goals include creating income from export earnings, either 
through direct sales of electricity or by selling cash crops or processed 
products from electricity-intensive industry such as aluminium refining. 
Clearly, dams can play an important role in meeting people's needs.</P>
<P>But the last 50 years have also highlighted the performance and the social 
and environmental impacts of large dams. They have fragmented and transformed 
the world's rivers, while global estimates suggest that 40-80 million people 
have been displaced by reservoirs. </P>
<P>As the basis for decision-making has become more open, inclusive and 
transparent in many countries, the decision to build a large dam has been 
increasingly contested, to the point where the future of large dam-building in 
many countries is in question.The enormous investments and widespread impacts of 
large dams have seen conflicts flare up over the siting and impacts of large 
dams - both those in place and those on the drawing board, making large dams one 
of the most hotly contested issues in sustainable development today. </P>
<P>Proponents point to the social and economic development demands that dams are 
intended to meet, such as irrigation, electricity, flood control and water 
supply. Opponents point to the adverse impacts of dams, such as debt burden, 
cost overruns, displacement and impoverishment of people, destruction of 
important ecosystems and fishery resources, and the inequitable sharing of costs 
and benefits.</P>
<P>With these conflicts and pressures in mind, the World Commission on Dams 
began its work in May 1998. One of the Commissioners' first points of agreement 
was that dams are only a means to an end. What is that end? How central are the 
challenges that large dams set out to meet? And how well can they meet these 
challenges?</P>
<P>The WCD concluded that the 'end' that any project achieves must be the 
sustainable improvement of human welfare. This means a significant advance of 
human development on a basis that is economically viable, socially equitable and 
environmentally sustainable. If a large dam is the best way to achieve this 
goal, it deserves support. Where other options offer better solutions, they 
should be favoured over large dams. Thus the debate around dams challenges views 
of how societies develop and manage water resources in the broader context of 
development choices.</P>
<P>After more than two years of intense study, dialogue with those for and 
against large dams, and reflection, the Commission believes there can no longer 
be any justifiable doubt about five key points:</P>
<OL type=1>
  <LI>Dams have made an important and significant contribution to human 
  development, and the benefits derived from them have been considerable 
  <LI>In too many cases an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been 
  paid to secure those benefits, especially in social and environmental terms, 
  by people displaced, by communities downstream, by taxpayers and by the 
  natural environment. 
  <LI>Lack of equity in the distribution of benefits has called into question 
  the value of many dams in meeting water and energy development needs when 
  compared with the alternatives 
  <LI>By bringing to the table all those whose rights are involved and who bear 
  the risks associated with different options for water and energy resources 
  development, the conditions for a positive resolution of competing interests 
  and conflicts are created 
  <LI>Negotiating outcomes will greatly improve the development effectiveness of 
  water and energy projects by eliminating unfavourable projects at an early 
  stage, and by offering as a choice only those options that key stakeholders 
  agree represent the best ones to meet the needs in question </LI></OL>
<H3>The Changing Context</H3>
<P>The Commission's overall conclusions about large dams are grounded in a basic 
understanding about the relationships between water, dams and development. (See 
Box 1 for the definition of a large dam.) One of the greatest challenges facing 
the world in this new century is rethinking the management of freshwater 
resources. A number of global initiatives and reports have documented the 
dramatic impact of withdrawals from the world's lakes, rivers and underground 
aquifers. Total annual freshwater withdrawals today are estimated at 3800 cubic 
kilometres - twice as much as 50 years ago.</P>

      <H4>Box 1. What is a large dam?</H4>
      <P>According to the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), a 
      large dam is 15 m or more high (from the foundation).</P>
      <P>If dams are between 5-15 metres and have a reservoir volume of more 
      than 3 million cubic metres they are also classified as large dams.</P>
      <P>Using this definition, there are more than 45 000 large dams around the 
      world.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
<P>The imperative to supply growing populations and economies with water when 
groundwater is depleted, water quality is declining, and there are increasingly 
severe limits to surface water extraction has brought sustainable water 
resources management to the top of the global development agenda. These 
pressures on water contain a wide range of threats, but they also generate the 
momentum for new opportunities and policy changes.</P>
<P>During the past few decades, societies have moved from seeing water as a free 
good to viewing it as a limited natural resource and, more recently, as an 
economic good and a human right. Thus water is recognised as a scarce natural 
resource, which gives rise to equity considerations in its allocation.</P>
<P>How much water is required for one more person, or one more urban dweller? 
Water use per capita varies greatly in different regions of the world. Although 
what constitutes an appropriate level of domestic water consumption is 
influenced by climate and culture, several international agencies and experts 
have proposed 50 litres per person per day as enough to cover basic human 
requirements for drinking, sanitation, bathing and cooking. In 1990, more than a 
billion people had less than that. At the same time, households in industrial 
countries and wealthy city-dwellers in developing countries were using 4-14 
times as much.</P>
<P><I>Dams and Development</I> notes the forecasts of leading analysts who 
foresee growing competition for water to meet demands for agriculture, industry 
and drinking water.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Competition will increase among the three largest users in global terms - 
  agriculture (67%), industry (19%) and municipal/residential (9%) uses - and 
  these all will continue to draw from the water needed to sustain natural 
  systems 
  <LI>A consumption factor that may be significant in dry climates is 
  evaporation from reservoirs, estimated to be close to 5% of total water 
  withdrawals 
  <LI>A projection prepared for the Vision for Water and Food suggests that 
  irrigation alone may require an increase in water supplies in the range of 
  15-20% by 2025 
  <LI>By 2025 there will be a total of 3.5 billion people living in 
  water-stressed countries. Empirical evidence suggests that limited water 
  supplies, combined with current agricultural practices and population growth, 
  are a barrier to meeting the goal of food self-sufficiency in more and more 
  countries, increasing the attention paid to food security and the security of 
  other environmental resources 
  <LI>Two billion people lack electricity, and electricity demand in developing 
  economies continues to rise 
  <LI>Freshwater species, especially fish, are increasingly threatened, a 
  significant percentage of wetlands have already been lost, and the capacity of 
  aquatic ecosystems to produce many of the goods and services on which 
  societies depend is rapidly declining, making water for nature an essential 
  consideration </LI></UL>
<P>During the last century, much of the world turned to dams to help meet 
escalating demands for water. Indeed, from the 1930s to the 1970s the 
construction of large dams became - in the eyes of many - synonymous with 
development and economic progress. Viewed as symbols of modernisation and 
humanity's ability to control and use nature's resources, dam construction saw a 
dramatic increase.</P>
<P>This trend reached a peak in the 1970s, when on average two or three new 
large dams were commissioned each day somewhere in the world. The decline in dam 
building since then has been equally dramatic, especially in North America and 
Europe, where most technically attractive sites are already developed.</P>
<P>The top five dam-building countries account for more than three-quarters of 
all large dams worldwide (see Figure 1), with approximately two-thirds of the 
world's existing large dams found in developing countries. Hydropower accounts 
for more than 90% of the total electricity supply in 24 countries, such as 
Brazil and Norway. Half of the world's large dams are built exclusively for 
irrigation, and dams are estimated to contribute to 12-16% of world food 
production. In addition, in at least 75 countries large dams have been built to 
control floods. For many nations, dams remain the largest single investment 
project in the country.</P>
<P>These hydropower, irrigation, water supply and flood control services were 
widely seen as sufficient to justify the significant investments made in dams, 
and other benefits were often cited as well. These included the impact of 
economic prosperity on a region due to multiple cropping, rural electrification 
and the expansion of physical and social infrastructure such as roads and 
schools. The benefits were seen as self-evident. When balanced with the 
construction and operational costs - in economic and financial terms - these 
benefits were seen to justify dams as the most competitive option.</P>

<P align=center><I>Source: WCD estimates, based on ICOLD and other 
sources.</I></P>
<H3>What Is the Debate About?</H3>
<P>As noted earlier, the reported returns on the investments made in dams have 
increasingly been questioned. The notion of costs versus reported benefits 
emerged as a public concern, given growing experience and knowledge about the 
performance and consequences of dams. Driven by research and information on the 
impacts of dams on people, river basins and ecosystems, as well as data on 
economic performance, opposition began to grow. During the early stages of this 
process, debate and controversy focused on specific dams and their local 
impacts. But gradually these locally driven conflicts began to evolve into a 
more general and ultimately a global debate about dams.</P>
<P>The issues surrounding dams are the same issues that surround water, and how 
water-related decisions are made, as well as how development effectiveness is 
assessed. There is little public controversy about the choice between an 
embankment dam or a gravity dam, or about whether to use earth, concrete or 
rock-fill. The problems all relate to what the dam will do to river flow and to 
rights of access to water and river resources; to whether the dam will uproot 
existing settlements, disrupt the culture and sources of livelihood of local 
communities, or deplete or degrade environmental resources; and to whether the 
dam is the best economic investment of public funds and resources.</P>
<P>The debate is partly about what occurred in the past and continues to occur 
today, and partly about what may unfold in the future if more dams are built. In 
some countries, it is driven primarily by specific social or environmental 
concerns; in others, by broader development considerations. In the United 
States, where the rate of decommissioning is greater than the rate of 
construction of new large dams, the debate is perhaps as intense as - but 
qualitatively different from - the debate in India, which along with China is 
now building the most dams.</P>
<P>The two principal poles in the debate illustrate the range of views on past 
experience with large dams. One perspective focuses on the gap between the 
promised benefits of a dam and the actual outcomes. The other view looks at the 
challenges of water and energy development from a perspective of 'nation 
building' and resource allocation. To proponents, the answer to any questions 
about past performance is self-evident, as they maintain that dams have 
generally performed well as an integral part of water and energy resource 
development strategies in over 140 nations and, with exceptions, have provided 
an indispensable range of water and energy services.</P>
<P>Opponents contend that better, cheaper, more benign options for meeting water 
and energy needs exist and have been frequently ignored, from small-scale, 
decentralised water supply and electricity options to large-scale end-use 
efficiency and demand-side management options. Dams, it is argued, have often 
been selected over other options that may meet water or energy goals at lower 
cost or that may offer development benefits that are more sustainable and more 
equitable.</P>
<P>Although there may be agreement on such issues as the need to take 
environmental and social costs of dams more seriously and to consult 
systematically with affected people, deep fault lines still separate critics and 
proponents on a number of financial, economic, social and environmental issues. 
Among the most intractable are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the extent to which alternatives to dams are viable for achieving various 
  development goals, and whether alternatives are complementary or mutually 
  exclusive 
  <LI>the extent to which adverse environmental and social impacts are 
  acceptable 
  <LI>the degree to which adverse environmental and social impacts can be 
  avoided or mitigated; and 
  <LI>the extent to which local consent should govern development decisions in 
  the future </LI></UL>
<P>The decision to build a large dam today is rarely only a local or national 
one. The debate has been transformed from a local process of assessing costs and 
benefits to one in which dams in general are the focus of a global debate about 
development strategies and choices.</P>
<H3>What Did the WCD Global Review of Large Dams Find?</H3>
<P>To fulfil its mandate to review the development effectiveness of large dams 
and assess alternatives for water resources and energy development, the 
Commission undertook eight detailed case studies of large dams and prepared 
country reviews for India and China plus a briefing paper on Russia and the 
Newly Independent States. (See Box 2 for a list of the case study dams.) </P>
<P>A survey of 125 large dams was also developed, along with 17 thematic reviews 
on social, environmental and economic issues; on alternatives to dams; and on 
governance and institutional processes. There were also 947 submissions and 
presentations at four regional consultations. All these inputs formed the core 
of the WCD Knowledge Base that served to inform the Commission on the main 
issues surrounding dams and their alternatives.</P>

<P>The Global Review had three components:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>an independent review of the performance and impacts of large dams 
  (looking at technical, financial and economic performance; ecosystem and 
  climate impacts; social impacts; and the distribution of project gains and 
  losses) 
  <LI>an assessment of the alternatives to dams, the opportunities they provide, 
  and the obstacles they face; and 
  <LI>an analysis of planning, decision-making and compliance issues that 
  underpin the selection, design, construction, operation and decommissioning of 
  dams</LI></UL>
<P>The WCD's evaluation of performance was based on the targets set for large 
dams by their proponents - the criteria that provided the basis for government 
approval and financing. The Commission's analysis gave particular attention to 
understanding why, how and where dams did not achieve their intended outcome, or 
indeed produced unanticipated outcomes. An integral part of this research 
involved documenting good practices that have emerged as a response to past 
shortcomings and difficulties. Presenting this analysis does not overlook the 
substantial benefits derived from dams, but rather responds to the question of 
why some dams achieve their goals while others fail.</P>
<H3>Technical, Financial and Economic Performance</H3>
<P>The degree to which large dams in the WCD Knowledge Base have delivered 
services and net benefits as planned varied substantially from one project to 
the next, with a considerable portion falling short of physical and economic 
targets. In spite of this, the services produced by dams are considerable, as 
noted earlier. Irrespective of performance against targets, the Knowledge Base 
also confirmed the longevity of large dams, with many continuing to generate 
benefits after 30-40 years of operation. </P>
<P>A sectoral review of technical, financial and economic performance of dams in 
the Knowledge Base in terms of planned versus actual performance suggested the 
following: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Large dams designed to deliver irrigation services have typically fallen 
  short of physical targets, did not recover their costs and have been less 
  profitable in economic terms than expected 
  <LI>Large dams built to deliver hydropower tend to perform close to but still 
  below targets for power generation, generally meet their financial targets but 
  demonstrate variable economic performance relative to targets, and include a 
  number of notable under- and over-performers 
  <LI>Large dams built for municipal and industrial water supply have generally 
  fallen short of intended targets for timing and delivery of bulk water supply 
  and have exhibited poor financial cost recovery and economic performance 
  <LI>Large dams with a flood control component have provided important benefits 
  in this regard, but at the same time have led to greater vulnerability to 
  flood hazards due to increased settlement in areas still at risk from floods, 
  and in some cases have worsened flood damages for a number of reasons, 
  including poor operation of dams 
  <LI>Large dams that serve multiple purposes also under-achieve relative to 
  targets, in some cases exceeding the shortfalls registered by single-purpose 
  projects, demonstrating that the targets established were often 
  over-optimistic </LI></UL>
<P>The review of performance suggested two further findings:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Large dams in the Knowledge Base have a marked tendency towards schedule 
  delays and significant cost overruns 
  <LI>Growing concern over the cost and effectiveness of large dams and 
  associated structural measures have led to the adoption of integrated flood 
  management that emphasises a mix of policy and non-structural measures to 
  reduce the vulnerability of communities to flooding</LI></UL>
<P>The review also examined factors related to the physical sustainability of 
large dams and their benefits and confirmed that:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Ensuring the safety of dams will require increasing attention and 
  investment as the stock of dams ages, maintenance costs rise and climate 
  change possibly alters the hydrological regime used as a basis for the design 
  of dam spillways 
  <LI>Sedimentation and the consequent long-term loss of storage is a serious 
  concern globally, and the effects will be particularly felt by basins with 
  high geological or human-induced erosion rates, dams in the lower reaches of 
  rivers and dams with smaller storage volumes 
  <LI>Waterlogging and salinity affect one-fifth of irrigated land globally - 
  including land irrigated by large dams - and have severe, long-term and often 
  permanent impacts on land, agriculture and livelihoods where rehabilitation is 
  not undertaken </LI></UL>
<P>Using the information on the performance of large dams collected in the WCD 
Knowledge Base, the Commission's report shows that there is considerable scope 
for improving the selection of projects and the operation of existing large dams 
and their associated infrastructure. Considering the enormous capital invested 
in large dams, it is surprising that substantive evaluations of project 
performance are few in number, narrow in scope and poorly integrated across 
impact categories and scales.</P>
<H3>Ecosystems and Large Dams</H3>
<P>The generic nature of the impacts of large dams on ecosystems, biodiversity 
and downstream livelihoods is increasingly well known. From the WCD Knowledge 
Base it is clear that large dams have led to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the loss of forests and wildlife habitat, the loss of species populations 
  and the degradation of upstream catchment areas due to inundation of the 
  reservoir area 
  <LI>the loss of aquatic biodiversity, of upstream and downstream fisheries, 
  and of the services of downstream floodplains, wetlands, and riverine, 
  estuarine and adjacent marine ecosystems; and 
  <LI>cumulative impacts on water quality, natural flooding and species 
  composition where a number of dams are sited on the same river </LI></UL>
<P>On balance, the ecosystem impacts are more negative than positive and they 
have led, in many cases, to significant and irreversible loss of species and 
ecosystems. In some cases, however, enhancement of ecosystem values does occur, 
through the creation of new wetland habitat and the fishing and recreational 
opportunities provided by new reservoirs.</P>
<P>The Commission found that reservoirs sampled so far by scientists all emit 
greenhouse gases, as do natural lakes, due to the rotting of vegetation and 
carbon inflows from the catchment. The scale of such emissions is highly 
variable. Preliminary data from a Case Study hydropower dam in Brazil show that 
the gross level of these emissions is significant, relative to emissions from 
equivalent thermal power plants.</P>
<P>However, in other reservoirs studied (notably those in boreal zones), gross 
emissions of greenhouse gases are significantly lower than the thermal 
alternative. A full comparison would require measurements of the emissions from 
natural pre-impoundment habitats. More research is needed on a case-by-case 
basis to demonstrate the capacity of hydropower to offset climate change.</P>
<P>Efforts to date to counter the ecosystem impacts of large dams have met with 
limited success due to the lack of attention to anticipating and avoiding such 
impacts, the poor quality and uncertainty of predictions, the difficulty of 
coping with all impacts, and the only partial implementation and success of 
mitigation measures. More specifically:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>It is not possible to mitigate many of the impacts of reservoir creation 
  on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, and efforts to 'rescue' wildlife 
  have met with little long-term success 
  <LI>The use of fish passes to mitigate the blockage of migratory fish has had 
  little success, as the technology has often not been tailored to specific 
  sites and species 
  <LI>Good mitigation results from a good information base; early co-operation 
  between ecologists, the dam design team and affected people; and regular 
  monitoring and feedback on the effectiveness of mitigation measures 
  <LI>Environmental flow requirements (which include managed flood releases) are 
  increasingly used to reduce the impacts of changed streamflow regimes on 
  aquatic, floodplain and coastal ecosystems downstream</LI></UL>
<P>Given the limited success of traditional mitigation measures, increased 
attention through legislation is now given to avoidance or minimisation of 
ecological impacts through setting aside particular river segments or basins in 
their natural state and through the selection of alternative projects, sites or 
designs. In addition, governments are experimenting with a 'compensatory' 
approach, offsetting the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity caused by a large 
dam through investment in conservation and regeneration measures and through 
protection of other threatened sites of equivalent ecological value.</P>
<P>Finally, in a number of industrialised countries, but particularly in the 
United States, ecosystem restoration is being implemented as a result of the 
decommissioning of large and small dams.</P>
<H3>People and Large Dams</H3>
<P>In terms of the social impacts of dams, the Commission found that the 
negative effects were frequently neither adequately assessed nor accounted for. 
The range of these impacts is substantial, including on the lives, livelihoods 
and health of the affected communities dependent on the riverine 
environment:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Some 40-80 million people have been physically displaced by dams worldwide 

  <LI>Millions of people living downstream from dams - particularly those 
  reliant on natural floodplain function and fisheries - have also suffered 
  serious harm to their livelihoods and the future productivity of their 
  resources has been put at risk 
  <LI>Many of the displaced were not recognised (or enumerated) as such, and 
  therefore were not resettled or compensated 
  <LI>Where compensation was provided it was often inadequate, and where the 
  physically displaced were enumerated, many were not included in resettlement 
  programmes 
  <LI>Those who were resettled rarely had their livelihoods restored, as 
  resettlement programmes have focused on physical relocation rather than the 
  economic and social development of the displaced 
  <LI>The larger the magnitude of displacement, the less likely it is that even 
  the livelihoods of affected communities can be restored 
  <LI>Even in the 1990s, impacts on downstream livelihoods were, in many cases, 
  not adequately assessed or addressed in the planning and design of large dams 
  </LI></UL>
<P>In sum, the Knowledge Base demonstrated a generalised lack of commitment or 
lack of capacity to cope with displacement. In addition, large dams in the 
Knowledge Base have also had significant adverse effects on cultural heritage 
through the loss of cultural resources of local communities and the submergence 
and degradation of plant and animal remains, burial sites and archaeological 
monuments.</P>
<P>The Knowledge Base indicated that the poor, other vulnerable groups and 
future generations are likely to bear a disproportionate share of the social and 
environmental costs of large dam projects without gaining a commensurate share 
of the economic benefits:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Indigenous and tribal peoples and vulnerable ethnic minorities have 
  suffered disproportionate levels of displacement and negative impacts on 
  livelihood, culture and spiritual existence 
  <LI>Affected populations living near reservoirs as well as displaced people 
  and downstream communities have often faced adverse health and livelihood 
  outcomes from environmental change and social disruption 
  <LI>Among affected communities, gender gaps have widened and women have 
  frequently borne a disproportionate share of the social costs and were often 
  discriminated against in the sharing of benefits</LI></UL>
<P>Where such inequities exist in the distribution of the costs and benefits, 
the Global Review emphasises that the 'balance-sheet' approach to adding up the 
costs and benefits is increasingly seen as unacceptable on equity grounds and as 
a poor means of choosing the 'best' projects. In any event, the true economic 
profitability of large dam projects remains elusive, as the environmental and 
social costs of large dams were poorly accounted for in economic terms. </P>
<P>More to the point, failures to account adequately for these impacts and to 
fulfil commitments that were made have led to the impoverishment and suffering 
of millions, giving rise to growing opposition to dams by affected communities 
worldwide. Innovative examples of processes for making reparations and sharing 
project benefits are emerging that provide hope that past injustices can be 
remedied and future ones avoided.</P>
<H3>Options for Water and Energy Resources Development</H3>
<P>The Global Review examined the options for meeting energy, water and food 
needs in today's circumstances and the barriers and enabling conditions that 
determine choice or adoption of particular options. Many options currently exist 
- including demand-side management (DSM), supply efficiency, and new supply 
options. These can all improve or expand water and energy services and meet 
evolving development needs across all segments of society. Viewing these options 
in an integrated fashion, rather than for individual sectors, suggested the 
following general findings and lessons:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Demand-side management options include reduced consumption, recycling and 
  technological and policy options that promote efficiency of water and power at 
  the point of end-use. DSM has significant untapped and universal potential and 
  provides a major opportunity to reduce water stress and power requirements as 
  well as achieve other benefits such as the reduction of greenhouse gas 
  emissions. 
  <LI>Improving system management can defer the need for new sources of supply 
  by enhancing supply and conveyance efficiency. Needless loss of power and 
  water can be avoided through reductions in water leakages from the system, 
  keeping up with system maintenance and upgrading of control, transmission and 
  distribution technology in the power sector 
  <LI>Basin and catchment management through vegetative and structural measures 
  offers an opportunity across all sectors to reduce sedimentation of reservoirs 
  and canals and to manage the timing and quantity of peak, seasonal and annual 
  flows, as well as groundwater recharge 
  <LI>A number of supply options have emerged that are locally and 
  environmentally appropriate, economically viable and acceptable to the public, 
  including recycling, rainwater harvesting and wind power</LI></UL>
<P>The ability of various options to meet existing and future needs or to 
replace conventional supplies depends on the specific context, but in general 
they offer significant potential, individually and collectively. </P>
<H3>Decision-Making, Planning and Compliance</H3>
<P>As a development choice, large dams often became a focal point for the 
interests of politicians, dominant and centralised government agencies, 
international financing agencies and the dam-building industry. Involvement from 
civil society varied with the degree of debate and open political discourse in a 
country. However, dams in the WCD Knowledge Base reveal a generalised failure to 
recognise affected people as partners in the planning process, with rights, and 
to empower them to participate in the process.</P>
<P>Foreign assistance has accounted for less than 15% of total funding for dams 
in developing countries. Still, the funds provided - more than $4 billion per 
year during the peak of lending in 1975-84 -played an important role in 
promoting and financing large dams in countries building only a few dams. These 
countries have often been vulnerable to conflicts between the interests of 
governments, donors and industry involved in foreign assistance programmes, on 
the one hand, and improved development outcomes for rural people, particularly 
the poor, on the other hand. </P>
<P>To a lesser extent this assistance has supported larger countries seeking to 
build many dams (including China, India and Brazil), primarily through the 
provision of finance for dam-building programmes. In shared river basins, the 
lack of agreements on water use is an increasing concern and cause for tension, 
particularly as demands grow and unilateral decisions by one country to build 
large dams alter water flows within a basin, with significant consequences for 
other riparian States.</P>
<P>Evaluation of the planning and project cycle for large dams revealed a series 
of limitations, risks and failures in the manner in which these facilities have 
been planned, operated and evaluated:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Participation and transparency in planning processes for large dams 
  frequently was neither inclusive nor open. 
  <LI>Options assessment has been typically limited in scope and confined 
  primarily to technical parameters and the narrow application of economic 
  cost-benefit analyses 
  <LI>The participation of affected people and the undertaking of environmental 
  and social impact assessment have often occurred late in the process and were 
  limited in scope 
  <LI>The paucity of monitoring and evaluation activity once a large dam is 
  built has impeded learning from experience 
  <LI>Many countries have not yet established licensing periods that clarify the 
  responsibilities of the owner towards the end of the dam's effective 
life</LI></UL>
<P>The net effect of these difficulties is that once a proposed dam project has 
passed preliminary technical and economic feasibility tests and attracted 
interest from government, external financing agencies or political interests, 
the momentum behind the project often prevails over further assessments. As a 
result, many dams were not built based on a comprehensive assessment and 
evaluation of the technical, financial and economic criteria applicable at the 
time, much less the social and environmental criteria that apply in today's 
context. That many such projects have not met standards applicable in either 
context is therefore not surprising, but nonetheless cause for concern.</P>
<P>Conflicts over dams stem also from the failure of dam proponents and 
financing agencies to fulfil commitments made, observe statutory regulations and 
abide by internal guidelines. In some cases, the opportunity for corruption 
provided by dams as large-scale infrastructure projects further distorted 
decision-making, planning and implementation. Whereas substantial improvements 
in policies, legal requirements and assessment guidelines have occurred, 
particularly in the 1990s, it appears that business is often conducted as usual 
when it comes to actual planning and decision-making. Moreover, where 
substantial differences arise between proponents and those potentially affected, 
efforts to modify plans and decisions often must resort to legal or other action 
outside the normal planning process. Regional Consultations held by the 
Commission underscored that past conflicts remain largely unresolved for a 
number of reasons, including poor experience with appeals, dispute resolution 
and recourse mechanisms.</P>
<P>Throughout the Global Review recent examples and illustrations of good 
practice are presented that form the basis of the Commission's optimism that 
these barriers are surmountable, and that these difficulties are not inevitable. 
As a means of reducing negative impacts and conflicts, these experiences 
indicate that there are opportunities, and indeed a responsibility, to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>increase the efficiency of existing assets; 
  <LI>avoid and minimise ecosystem impacts 
  <LI>engage in participatory, multi-criteria analysis of development needs and 
  options; 
  <LI>ensure that displaced and project-affected peoples' livelihoods are 
  improved 
  <LI>resolve past inequities and injustices, and transform project-affected 
  people into beneficiaries 
  <LI>conduct regular monitoring and periodic review; and 
  <LI>develop, apply and enforce incentives, sanctions and recourse mechanisms - 
  especially in the area of environmental and social performance</LI></UL>
<P>The Commission's recommendations deliver a way forward that can improve 
planning, decision-making and compliance, and thereby capitalise on the options 
available - whether technological, policy or institutional in nature - and 
provide economically efficient, socially equitable and environmentally 
sustainable solutions to meet future water and energy needs.</P>
<H3>How Can We Achieve Better Outcomes?</H3>
<P>The debate about dams is a debate about the very meaning, purpose and 
pathways for achieving development. Along with all development choices, 
decisions on dams and their alternatives must respond to a wide range of needs, 
expectations, objectives and constraints. They are a function of public choice 
and public policy. To resolve underlying conflicts about the effectiveness of 
dams and their alternatives, a broad consensus is needed on the norms that guide 
development choices and the criteria that should define the process of 
negotiation and decision-making.</P>
<P>To improve development outcomes in the future we need to look at proposed 
water and energy development projects in a much wider setting - a setting that 
reflects full knowledge and understanding of the benefits and impacts of large 
dam projects and alternative options for all parties. It means that we have to 
bring new voices, perspectives and criteria into decision-making, and we need to 
develop an approach that will build consensus around the decisions reached. This 
will result in fundamental changes in the way decisions are made.</P>
<P>Such a process must start with a clear understanding of the shared values, 
objectives and goals of development. The Commission grouped the core values 
informing its understanding of these issues under five main headings:</P>
<OL type=1>
  <LI>equity, 
  <LI>efficiency, 
  <LI>participatory decision-making, 
  <LI>sustainability and 
  <LI>accountability</LI></OL>
<P>These five values run through the entire report and are the foci of concerns 
raised by the evidence presented in the Global Review. They are also aligned 
with the international framework of norms articulated in the UN Declaration of 
Human Rights that the Commission cites as a powerful framework of 
internationally accepted standards.</P>
<P>Considerable support exists for rights, particularly basic human rights, to 
be considered as a fundamental reference point in any debate on dams - starting 
with the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the 
related covenants adopted thereafter, through to the Declaration on the Right to 
Development adopted by the General Assembly in 1986 and the Rio Principles 
agreed to at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.</P>
<P>Given the significance of rights-related issues as well as the nature and 
magnitude of potential risks for all parties concerned, the Commission proposes 
that an approach based on 'recognition of rights' and 'assessment of risks' 
(particularly rights at risk) be developed as a tool for guiding future planning 
and decision-making. This will also provide a more effective framework for 
integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions for options 
assessment and the planning and project cycles.</P>
<P>Clarifying the rights context for a proposed project is an essential step in 
identifying those legitimate claims and entitlements that might be affected by 
the proposed project - or indeed, its alternatives. It is also the basis for 
effective identification of stakeholder groups that are entitled to a formal 
role in the consultative process, and eventually in negotiating project-specific 
agreements relating, for example, to benefit sharing, resettlement or 
compensation.</P>
<P>The notion of risk adds an important dimension to understanding how, and to 
what extent, a project may have an impact on such rights. Traditional practice 
is to restrict the definition of risk to the risk of the developer or corporate 
investor in terms of capital invested and expected returns. These voluntary 
risk-takers have the capacity to define the level and type of risk they wish to 
take and explicitly to define its boundaries and acceptability. In contrast, as 
the Global Review showed, a far larger group often has risks imposed on them 
involuntarily and managed by others. Typically, these involuntary risk-bearers 
have little or no say in overall water and energy policy, in the choice of 
specific projects or in project design and implementation. The risks they face 
directly affect individual well-being, livelihoods, quality of life, even their 
spiritual world view and very survival.</P>
<P>Dealing with risks cannot be reduced to consulting actuarial tables or 
applying a mathematical formula. In the end, as in the case of rights and 
entitlements, they must be identified, articulated and addressed explicitly. 
This will require the acknowledgement of risk to be extended to a wider group 
than governments or developers in order to include both those affected by a 
project and the environment as a public good.</P>
<P>A rights-and-risks approach to options assessment and to the planning and 
project cycles presents an effective framework to determine who has a legitimate 
place at the negotiation table and what issues need to be on the agenda (see 
Figure 2). It empowers decision-making processes based on the pursuit of 
negotiated outcomes, conducted in an open and transparent manner and inclusive 
of all legitimate actors involved in the issue, thereby helping to resolve the 
many and complex issues surrounding water, dams and development. While 
presenting greater demands at early stages of options assessment and project 
design, it leads to greater clarity and legitimacy for subsequent steps in 
decision-making and implementation.</P>

options assessment and project planning</H4>
<DIV align=center><IMG alt=en_fig2 border=0 height=374 
src="Geo-2-122_files/en_fig2.gif" width=430> </DIV>
<P>Having laid the groundwork of five core values and a rights-and-risks 
approach, the Commission developed a constructive and innovative way forward for 
decision-making in the form of seven strategic priorities and corresponding 
policy principles. These are written in terms of the outcomes to be achieved. 
They are supported by a practical set of principles and guidelines designed for 
adoption, adaptation and use by all those involved in the dams debate. These 
move from a traditional top-down, technology-focused approach to advocate 
significant innovations in assessing options, managing existing dams, gaining 
public acceptance and negotiating and sharing benefits.</P>
<H3>Strategic Priorities for Decision-Making</H3>
<H4>Gaining Public Acceptance.</H4>
<P>Public acceptance of key decisions is essential for equitable and sustainable 
water and energy resources development. Acceptance emerges from recognising 
rights, addressing risks, and safeguarding the entitlements of all groups of 
affected people, particularly indigenous and tribal peoples, women and other 
vulnerable groups. </P>
<P>Decision-making processes and mechanisms are used that enable informed 
participation by all groups of people, and result in the demonstrable acceptance 
of key decisions. Where projects affect indigenous and tribal peoples, such 
processes are guided by their free, prior and informed consent.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Recognition of rights and assessment of risks is the basis for the 
  identification and inclusion of stakeholders in decision-making on energy and 
  water resources development 
  <LI>Access to information, legal and other support is available to all 
  stakeholders, particularly indigenous and tribal peoples, women and other 
  vulnerable groups, to enable their informed participation in decision-making 
  processes 
  <LI>Demonstrable public acceptance of all key decisions is achieved through 
  agreements negotiated in an open and transparent process conducted in good 
  faith and with the informed participation of all stakeholders 
  <LI>Decisions on projects affecting indigenous and tribal peoples are guided 
  by their free, prior and informed consent, achieved through formal and 
  informal representative bodies. </LI></UL>
<H4>Comprehensive Options Assessment</H4>
<P>Alternatives to dams often do exist. To explore these alternatives, needs for 
water, food and energy are assessed and objectives clearly defined. The 
appropriate development response is identified from a range of possible options. 
The selection is based on a comprehensive and participatory assessment of the 
full range of policy, institutional and technical options. </P>
<P>In the assessment process, social and environmental aspects have the same 
significance as economic and financial factors. The options assessment process 
continues through all stages of planning, project development and operations. 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Development needs and objectives are clearly formulated through an open 
  and participatory process before the identification and assessment of options 
  for water and energy resource development 
  <LI>Planning approaches that take into account the full range of development 
  objectives are used to assess all policy, institutional, management and 
  technical options before the decision to proceed with any programme or project 

  <LI>Social and environmental aspects are given the same significance as 
  technical, economic and financial factors in assessing options 
  <LI>Increasing the effectiveness and sustainability of existing water, 
  irrigation and energy systems is given priority in the options assessment 
  process. 
  <LI>If a dam is selected through such a comprehensive options assessment, 
  social and environmental principles are applied in the review and selection of 
  options throughout the detailed planning, design, construction and operation 
  phases </LI></UL>
<H4>Addressing Existing Dams</H4>
<P>Opportunities exist to optimise benefits from many existing dams, address 
outstanding social issues and strengthen environmental mitigation and 
restoration measures.</P>
<P>Dams and the context in which they operate are not seen as static over time. 
Benefits and impacts may be transformed by changes in water use priorities, 
physical and land use changes in the river basin, technological developments, 
and changes in public policy expressed in environment, safety, economic and 
technical regulations. </P>
<P>Management and operation practices must adapt continuously to changing 
circumstances over the project's life and must address outstanding social 
issues.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A comprehensive post-project monitoring and evaluation process and a 
  system of longer-term periodic reviews of the performance, benefits and 
  impacts for all existing large dams are introduced 
  <LI>Programmes to restore, improve and optimise benefits from existing large 
  dams are identified and implemented. Options to consider include: 
  rehabilitate, modernise and upgrade equipment and facilities; optimise 
  reservoir operations; and introduce non-structural measures to improve the 
  efficiency of delivery and use of services 
  <LI>Outstanding social issues associated with existing large dams are 
  identified and assessed; processes and mechanisms are developed with affected 
  communities to remedy them. 
  <LI>The effectiveness of existing environmental mitigation measures is 
  assessed and unanticipated impacts are identified; opportunities for 
  mitigation, restoration and enhancement are recognised, identified and acted 
  on 
  <LI>All large dams have formalised operating agreements with time-bound 
  license periods; where re-planning or relicensing processes indicate that 
  major physical changes to facilities, or decommissioning, may be advantageous, 
  a full feasibility study and environmental and social impact assessment is 
  undertaken </LI></UL>
<H4>Sustaining Rivers and Livelihoods</H4>
<P>Rivers, watersheds and aquatic ecosystems are the biological engines of the 
planet. They are the basis for life and the livelihoods of local communities. 
Dams transform landscapes and create risks of irreversible impacts. 
Understanding, protecting and restoring ecosystems at river basin level is 
essential to foster equitable human development and the welfare of all 
species.</P>
<P>Options assessment and decision-making around river development prioritises 
the avoidance of impacts, followed by the minimisation and mitigation of harm to 
the health and integrity of the river system. Avoiding impacts through good site 
selection and project design is a priority. Releasing tailor-made environmental 
flows can help maintain downstream ecosystems and the communities that depend on 
them.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A basin-wide understanding of the ecosystem's functions, values and 
  requirements, and how community livelihoods depend on and influence them, is 
  required before decisions on development options are made 
  <LI>Decisions value ecosystem, social and health issues as an integral part of 
  project and river basin development, and avoidance of impacts is given 
  priority, in accordance with a precautionary approach 
  <LI>A national policy is developed for maintaining selected rivers with high 
  ecosystem functions and values in their natural state. When reviewing 
  alternative locations for dams on undeveloped rivers, priority is given to 
  locations on tributaries 
  <LI>Project options are selected that avoid significant impacts on threatened 
  and endangered species. When impacts cannot be avoided, viable compensation 
  measures are put in place that will result in a net gain for the species 
  within the region 
  <LI>Large dams provide for releasing environmental flows to help maintain 
  downstream ecosystem integrity and community livelihoods and are designed, 
  modified and operated accordingly </LI></UL>
<H4>Recognising Entitlements and Sharing Benefits</H4>
<P>Joint negotiations with adversely affected people result in mutually agreed 
and legally enforceable mitigation and development provisions. These provisions 
recognise entitlements that improve livelihoods and quality of life, and 
affected people are beneficiaries of the project. </P>
<P>Successful mitigation, resettlement and development are fundamental 
commitments and responsibilities of the State and the developer. They bear the 
onus to satisfy all affected people that moving from their current context and 
resources will improve their livelihoods. Accountability of responsible parties 
to agreed mitigation, resettlement and development provisions is ensured through 
legal means, such as contracts, and through accessible legal recourse at 
national and international levels. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Recognition of rights and assessment of risks is the basis for 
  identification and inclusion of adversely affected stakeholders in joint 
  negotiations on mitigation, resettlement and development-related 
  decision-making. 
  <LI>Impact assessment includes all people in the reservoir, upstream, 
  downstream and catchment areas whose properties, livelihoods and non-material 
  resources are affected. It also includes those affected by dam-related 
  infrastructure such as canals, transmission lines and resettlement 
  developments 
  <LI>All recognised adversely affected people negotiate mutually agreed, formal 
  and legally enforceable mitigation, resettlement and development entitlements 
  <LI>Adversely affected people are recognised as first among the beneficiaries 
  of the project. Mutually agreed and legally protected benefit-sharing 
  mechanisms are negotiated to ensure implementation </LI></UL>
<H4>Ensuring Compliance</H4>
<P>Ensuring public trust and confidence requires that governments, developers, 
regulators and operators meet all commitments made for the planning, 
implementation and operation of dams. Compliance with applicable regulations, 
with criteria and guidelines, and with project-specific negotiated agreements is 
secured at all critical stages in project planning and implementation. </P>
<P>A set of mutually reinforcing incentives and mechanisms is required for 
social, environmental and technical measures. These should involve an 
appropriate mix of regulatory and non-regulatory measures, incorporating 
incentives and sanctions. Regulatory and compliance frameworks use incentives 
and sanctions to ensure effectiveness where flexibility is needed to accommodate 
changing circumstances.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A clear, consistent and common set of criteria and guidelines to ensure 
  compliance is adopted by sponsoring, contracting and financing institutions, 
  and compliance is subject to independent and transparent review. 
  <LI>A Compliance Plan is prepared for each project prior to commencement, 
  spelling out how compliance will be achieved with relevant criteria and 
  guidelines and specifying binding arrangements for project-specific technical, 
  social and environmental commitments 
  <LI>Incentives that reward project proponents for abiding by criteria and 
  guidelines are developed by public and private financial institutions 
  <LI>Costs for establishing compliance mechanisms and related institutional 
  capacity, and their effective application, are built into the project budget 
  <LI>Corrupt practices are avoided through enforcement of legislation, 
  voluntary integrity pacts, debarment and other instruments </LI></UL>
<H4>Sharing Rivers for Peace, Development and Security</H4>
<P>Storage and diversion of water on transboundary rivers has been a source of 
considerable tension between countries and within countries. As specific 
interventions for diverting water, dams require constructive co-operation. 
Consequently, the use and management of resources increasingly becomes the 
subject of agreement between States to promote mutual self-interest for regional 
co-operation and peaceful collaboration. This leads to a shift in focus from the 
narrow approach of allocating a finite resource to the sharing of rivers and 
their associated benefits in which States are innovative in defining the scope 
of issues for discussion. External financing agencies support the principles of 
good faith negotiations between riparian States.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>National water policies make specific provision for basin agreements in 
  shared river basins. Agreements are negotiated on the basis of good faith 
  among riparian States. They are based on principles of equitable and 
  reasonable utilisation, no significant harm, prior information and the 
  Commission's strategic priorities 
  <LI>Riparian States go beyond looking at water as a finite commodity to be 
  divided and embrace an approach that equitably allocates not the water, but 
  the benefits that can be derived from it. Where appropriate, negotiations 
  include benefits outside the river basin and other aspects of mutual interest. 

  <LI>Dams on shared rivers are not built in cases where riparian States raise 
  an objection that is upheld by an independent panel. Intractable disputes 
  between countries are resolved through various means of dispute resolution 
  including, in the last instance, the International Court of Justice 
  <LI>For the development of projects on rivers shared between political units 
  within countries, the necessary legislative provision is made at national and 
  sub-national levels to embody the Commission's strategic priorities of 
  'gaining public acceptance', 'recognising entitlements' and 'sustaining rivers 
  and livelihoods' 
  <LI>Where a government agency plans or facilitates the construction of a dam 
  on a shared river in contravention of the principle of good faith negotiations 
  between riparians, external financing bodies withdraw their support for 
  projects and programmes promoted by that agency </LI></UL>
<H2>A New Focus for Planning and Decision-Making</H2>
<P>The strategic priorities recommended by the Commission lie within a broad 
framework of existing and emerging policy and regulation at local, national and 
international levels. (See Figure 3.) Turning these priorities and their 
underlying principles into reality requires a new focus for planning and 
management in the water and energy sectors.</P>
<P>This can best be achieved by focusing on the key stages in decision-making 
that influence final outcomes and where compliance with regulatory requirements 
can be verified. The Commission has identified five critical decision points 
when water and energy options are considered. The first two relate to planning, 
leading to decisions on a preferred development plan: </P>
<OL type=1>
  <LI>Needs assessment - validating the needs for water and energy services 
  <LI>Selecting alternatives - identifying the preferred development plan from 
  among the full range of options </LI></OL>
<P>Where a dam emerges from this process as a preferred development alternative, 
three further critical decision points occur:</P>
<OL start=3 type=1>
  <LI>Project preparation - verifying that agreements are in place before tender 
  of the construction contract 
  <LI>Project implementation - confirming compliance before commissioning 
  <LI>Project operation - adapting to changing contexts </LI></OL>
<P>Each of the five decision points represents a commitment to actions that 
govern the course of future conduct and the allocation of resources. They are 
points where ministries and government agencies need to test compliance with 
preceding processes before giving the green light to proceed to the next stage. 
They are not exhaustive, and within each stage many other decisions have to be 
taken and agreements reached. The five stages and associated decision points 
need to be interpreted within the overall planning contexts of individual 
countries. The Commission also noted that even when these decision points have 
been passed, there are certain steps that should be taken to improve outcomes 
(See Box 3).</P>

      <H4>Box 3. Dams in the pipeline</H4>
      <P>There are many dam projects today at various stages of planning and 
      development. It is never too late to improve the outcomes of projects - 
      even ones this large in scale and scope. <I>Dams and Development</I> calls 
      for an open and participatory review of all ongoing and planned projects 
      to see whether changes are needed to bring them into line with the WCD 
      strategic priorities and policy principles. In general, regulators, 
      developers and, where appropriate, financing agencies should ensure that 
      such a review:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>uses a stakeholder analysis based on recognising rights and 
        assessing risks, in order to identify a stakeholder forum that is 
        consulted on all issues affecting them 
        <LI>enables vulnerable and disadvantaged stakeholder groups to 
        participate in an informed manner; 
        <LI>includes a distribution analysis to see who shares the costs and 
        benefits of the project 
        <LI>develops agreed mitigation and resettlement measures to promote 
        development opportunities and benefit sharing for displaced and 
        adversely affected people 
        <LI>avoids, through modified design, any severe and irreversible 
        ecosystem impacts 
        <LI>provides for an environmental flow requirement, and mitigates or 
        compensates any unavoidable ecosystem impacts; and 
        <LI>designs and implements recourse and compliance mechanisms</LI></UL>
      <P>This process of review implies added investigations or commitments, the 
      re-negotiation of contracts and the incorporation of a Compliance Plan. 
      But additional financial costs will be recouped in lower overall costs to 
      the operator, to government and to society in general as a consequence of 
      avoiding negative outcomes and 
conflicts.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
<P>Social, environmental, governance and compliance aspects have been 
undervalued in decision-making in the past. In light of this, the Commission 
developed criteria and 26 guidelines to complement the body of knowledge on good 
practices and to add value to current national and international guidelines, 
including those on technical, economic and financial aspects. Seen in 
conjunction with existing decision-support instruments, the Commission's 
criteria and guidelines provide a new direction for appropriate and sustainable 
development.</P>
<P>Bringing about this change will require: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>planners to identify stakeholders through a process that recognises rights 
  and assesses risks 
  <LI>States to invest more at an earlier stage to screen out inappropriate 
  projects and facilitate integration across sectors within the context of the 
  river basin 
  <LI>consultants and agencies to ensure outcomes from feasibility studies are 
  socially and environmentally acceptable 
  <LI>all players to promote open and meaningful participation during planning 
  and implementation, leading to negotiated outcomes 
  <LI>developers to accept accountability through contractual commitments, for 
  effectively mitigating social and environmental impacts 
  <LI>independent reviewers to improve compliance; and 
  <LI>dam owners to apply lessons learned from past experiences through regular 
  monitoring and adapting to changing needs and contexts</LI></UL>
<P>The Commission offers its criteria and guidelines to help States, developers 
and owners, as well as affected communities and civil society in general, meet 
emerging societal expectations when faced with the complex issues associated 
with dam projects. This will foster informed and appropriate decisions, thereby 
raising the level of public acceptance and improving development outcomes.</P>
<H2>What's Next?</H2>
<P><I>Dams and Development</I> distils more than two years of intense study, 
dialogue and reflection by the World Commission on Dams and the WCD 
Stakeholders' Forum and literally hundreds of individual experts on every facet 
of the dams debate. It contains all the significant findings that result from 
this work and expresses everything that the Commissioners feel is important to 
communicate to governments, the private sector, civil society, international 
organisations and affected peoples - in short, to the entire spectrum of 
participants in the dams debate.</P>
<P>The directions are clear. It is one thing, however, to see this. It is 
another to actively break through traditional boundaries of thinking - to look 
at familiar issues from a different perspective. This is what the Commission had 
to do, and found was indeed possible. Similar constructive processes are at work 
among many of the constituencies that participated so actively in the WCD 
process.</P>
<P>It is time to bring the debate home. The controversy over dams has 
appropriately been raised to the international stage. A dissipation of that 
controversy, however, should allow decisions about fundamental water and energy 
development choices to be made at the most appropriate level - one where the 
voices of powerful international players and interests do not drown out the many 
voices of those with a direct stake in the decisions. For this to work, all the 
actors have to make a commitment to step out of their familiar frames of 
reference. The Commission recommends that the report be used as the starting 
point for discussions, debates, internal reviews and reassessments of what may 
be established procedures and for an assessment of how they can evolve to 
address a changed reality.</P>
<P><I>Dams and Development</I> proposes a number of entry points to help 
organisations identify steps they can take right away in response to the report. 
In general, the Commission hopes that all interested parties will: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>review carefully and actively disseminate the report 
  <LI>issue public statements of support for the approach taken 
  <LI>review dams currently under development with the WCD criteria and 
  guidelines in mind; and 
  <LI>support investments in building capacity, particularly in developing 
  countries, for options assessment and improved decision-making</LI></UL>
<P>Specific proposals are included for national governments and line ministries, 
civil society groups, the private sector, bilateral aid agencies, multilateral 
development banks, export credit agencies, international organisations, and 
academic and research bodies. (See Box 4.) Engaging through these entry points 
would initiate permanent changes to advance the principles, criteria and 
guidelines in the report.</P>

      <H4>Box 4. Selected recommendations for key stakeholders in the dams 
      debate</H4>
      <P><B>National governments</B> can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>require a review of existing procedures and regulations concerning 
        large dam projects; 
        <LI>adopt the practice of time-bound licences for all dams, whether 
        public or privately owned 
        <LI>establish an independent, multi-stakeholder committee to address the 
        unresolved legacy of past dams</LI></UL>
      <P><B>Civil society groups</B> can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>monitor compliance with agreements and assist any aggrieved party to 
        seek resolution of outstanding disagreements or to seek recourse 
        <LI>actively assist in identifying the relevant stakeholders for dam 
        projects, using the rights-and-risks approach</LI></UL>
      <P><B>Affected peoples' organisations</B> can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>identify unresolved social and environmental impacts and convince 
        the relevant authorities to take effective steps to address them 
        <LI>develop support networks and partnerships to strengthen the 
        technical and legal capacity for needs and options assessment 
        processes</LI></UL>
      <P><B>Professional associations</B> can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>develop processes for certifying compliance with WCD guidelines 
        <LI>extend national and international data-bases, such as the ICOLD 
        World Register of Dams, to include social and environmental 
        parameters</LI></UL>
      <P>The <B>private sector</B> can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>develop and adopt voluntary codes of conduct, management systems and 
        certification procedures for best ensuring and demonstrating compliance 
        with the Commission's guidelines, including, for example, through the 
        ISO 14001 management system standard 
        <LI>abide by the provisions of the anti-bribery convention of the 
        Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
        <LI>adopt integrity pacts for all contracts and procurement</LI></UL>
      <P><B>Bilateral aid agencies</B> and <B>multilateral development banks</B> 
      can:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>ensure that any dam options for which financing is approved emerge 
        from an agreed process of ranking of alternatives and respect WCD 
        guidelines 
        <LI>accelerate the shift from project- to sector-based finance, 
        especially through increasing financial and technical support for 
        effective, transparent, and participatory needs and options assessment, 
        and the financing of non-structural alternatives 
        <LI>review the portfolio of projects to identify any past ones that may 
        have under-performed or present unresolved 
issues</LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
<P>The trust required to enable different sectors and players to work together 
must still be consolidated. Early and resolute action to address some of the 
issues arising from the past will go a long way towards building that trust in 
the future. So, too, would an assurance to countries still at an early stage of 
economic development that the dams option will not be foreclosed before they 
have had a chance to examine their water and energy development choices within 
the context of their own development process.</P>
<P>The experience of the Commission demonstrates that common ground can be found 
without compromising individual values or losing a sense of purpose. But it also 
demonstrates that all concerned parties must enter into the process in good 
faith if we are to resolve the issues surrounding water and energy resources 
development. It is a process with multiple heirs and no clear arbiter. We must 
move forward together or we will fail. </P>
<P>There will, of course, be further disagreement on these issues. Dynamic 
debate leads frequently to better outcomes. The Commission believes, however, 
that business as usual is not a viable strategy. The report closes with a call 
to action and a challenge to all readers:</P>
<P>We have conducted the first comprehensive and global review of the 
performance of dams and their contribution to development. We have done this 
through an inclusive process that has brought all significant players into the 
debate. And we believe we have shifted the centre of gravity in the dams debate 
to one focused on options assessment and participatory decision-making. The 
rights-and-risks approach we propose will raise the importance of social and 
environmental dimensions of dams to a level once reserved for the economic 
dimension.</P>
<P align=center><B>We have told our story. What happens next is up to 
you.</B></P>
<H2>WCD Forum </H2>
<P>Coming from 68 institutions in 36 countries, members of the Forum reflect the 
range of interests in the dams debate. The Forum acted as a "sounding board" for 
the work of the Commission, and helped maintain two-way communication with the 
various far-flung dam constituencies. Forum members can help to build ownership 
of Commission work. The WCD is also conscious that reports in themselves have 
little impact if they are not firmly rooted in a process that enables all 
interest groups to develop an understanding of and confidence in the process 
itself. Membership of the WCD Forum however does not imply endorsement of the 
Commission's report and findings.</P>

<H2>The Report in print</H2>
<P>Dams provide a unique arena for understanding the complex choices facing 
societies in meeting their water and energy needs. By the year 2000 the world 
had built more than 45 000 large dams. This brief <IMG align=right border=0 
height=181 hspace=3 src="Geo-2-122_files/book_oblique.gif" vspace=4 
width=164>overview provides a summary of <I>Dams and Development</I>: A New 
Framework for Decision-Making, the report of the World Commission on Dams. The 
report:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>is the product of an unprecedented global public policy effort to bring 
  governments, the private sector and civil society together in one process 
  <LI>provides the first comprehensive global and independent review of the 
  performance and impacts of large dams 
  <LI>presents a new framework for water and energy resources development, and 
  <LI>develops an agenda of seven strategic priorities and corresponding 
  criteria and guidelines to guide future decision-making </LI></UL>
<P>Challenging our assumptions, the Commission sets before us the hard, rigorous 
and clear-eyed evidence of exactly why nations decide to build dams and how dams 
can affect human, plant and animal life, for better or for worse. This overview 
illustrates why <I>Dams and Development</I> is vital reading on the future of 
dams as well as on the changing development context - in which new voices, 
choices and options leave little room for a business-as-usual scenario.</P>
