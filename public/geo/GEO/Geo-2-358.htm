<BR>Floods are one of the most significant natural hazards for Canada; they are 
frequent, have relatively rapid speeds of onset, can affect large areas, and can 
cause extensive losses to property and life. The worst flood disaster in world 
history occurred in August, 1931 along the Huang He River in China and killed an 
estimated 3.7 million people. The world&#8217;s death toll from floods between 1966 
and 1990 was 117,000 &#8211; an average of 4,680 persons per year (Lawford, et al., 
1995). 
<P>The worst Canadian flood occurred in the summer of 1996 (see <A 
href="http://www.utoronto.ca/env/nh/tab2-11.htm">Table 2.11</A>). The Saguenay 
River valley in Quebec received roughly 290 mm of rainfall in approximately 36 
hours. Though few people died, more than $1 billion in damages resulted. In 
October, 1954, hurricane Hazel struck the Toronto region, causing extensive 
flooding, 79 deaths, and $133.3 million in damages (Andrews, 1993). 
<P>Although the economic and social impacts of floods can be quite staggering, 
far more money is spent on flood prevention. For instance, roughly $600 million 
per year is expended on construction of drainage systems in the Toronto area. 
Extrapolating this figure across Canada, this suggests nearly $3-5 billion per 
year is spent on storm sewers and other drainage networks (Canadian National 
Report - <A href="http://www.utoronto.ca/env/nh/acron.htm">IDNDR</A>, 1994; 
Hogg, 1994; Etkin and Maarouf, 1995). Because of the economic losses caused by 
flooding and the cost of prevention, flooding is considered a significant hazard 
in Canada (Lawford et al., 1995). 
<P>Floods result when natural drainage channels, or human-made facsimiles, 
cannot convey all the water supplied to them; excess water spills over the banks 
and inundates the surrounding areas. The characteristics of the drainage basin 
also contributes to the hazard (Lawford et al., 1995). Flooding is usually 
caused by intense localised rainfall, prolonged rainfall on saturated surfaces, 
ice jams, snowmelt, or any combination of these. 
<P>A drainage basin&#8217;s size, shape, topography, vegetation cover and degree of 
development may determine whether a basin will flood or not. For instance, heavy 
rain may not cause flooding in a natural area as infiltration, vegetation or 
gentle slope gradients may reduce the amount of runoff and keep it from reaching 
the drainage channel. However, this same event may cause extensive flooding in 
urban areas because of the large areas of impenetrable surfaces (e.g. pavement, 
roofs and heavily compacted soils). Impermeable surfaces render urban areas 
highly vulnerable to flooding (Lawford et al., 1995), by promoting rapid rates 
of runoff that result in large quantities of water inundating urban drainage 
networks (e.g. sewer and canals). Many cities, whether they are located in river 
valleys or not, are thus prone to flooding (e.g. by sewer back-up or runoff), 
especially if their drainage systems are inadequate. 
<P>It is difficult to provide a spatial representation of flood-prone areas in 
Canada due to the numerous causes of flooding. The most susceptible regions 
include all of southern Ontario and Quebec, the southern half of British 
Columbia, isolated regions of southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba and most of the 
Maritimes. 
<P>The main causes of flooding in Canada are spring ice jams and snowmelt, and 
heavy summer rainfall (Lawford et al., 1995; Etkin and Maarouf, 1995; Hogg, 
1994; Phillips, 1990). Flooding in Canada peaks in April and is at a minimum in 
<P>September. During winter and early spring, winter precipitation causes floods 
on the west coast. In May, delayed snowmelt and ice jams lead to flooding in the 
north. Between May and September, the major cause of frequent flooding is heavy, 
convective rainfall (Lawford et al., 1995). In June, flooding can occur in 
mountainous regions as a result of high mountain snow and glacier melt. Other 
minor forms of flooding are due to wind driven waves and storm surges along the 
coastal regions of Canada, especially the Maritimes (Phillips, 1990). 
<P><B><I>Rainstorm Floods</I></B> <BR>Rainstorm floods are controlled by the 
nature of the rain event and the characteristics of the land on which it falls. 
Intense, localised thunderstorms can produce major flooding in small catchments 
and minor flooding in urban areas. Rainstorm floods can be caused by larger, 
mesoscale thunderstorm complexes, which can inundate medium-sized areas, small 
to medium sized waterways and most urban environments with vast quantities of 
water. The most damaging events come form the large-scale frontal cyclones, or 
mid-latitude cyclones, which can easily cause flooding in Canada&#8217;s major 
waterways. 
<P><B><I>Icejam Floods</I></B> <BR>The magnitude of ice jam floods are partly a 
function of the discharge flowing through a river and the size of the ice jam 
obstruction. The location of these floods is controlled by the morphology of the 
waterway; the shape of the river controls the location of the build-up of ice 
pack. Ice jams occur during freeze-up of rivers in winter or the break-up of 
winter ice cover in early spring. During the cold months, a layer of ice 
develops on river surfaces, leaving water to flow beneath. This ice cover can be 
thin, because of spring melting or insufficient winter freezing. If enough water 
is supplied to the river (e.g. from snowmelt or rainfall), pressure exerted from 
underneath may be sufficient to break the ice cover. If so, the ice pack then 
flows downstream &#8211; a common event along many Canadian waterways. 
<P>These chunks of ice may then become lodged where the flow is constricted, 
obstructed or slowed. They may converge at channel bends and bridge piers, where 
rivers bifurcate around islands, or become more shallow and have gentle 
gradients. When significant amounts of ice build-up, they may block the flow of 
water. As water collects in the newly formed reservoir behind the jam, areas 
upstream may begin to flood. If the icejam breaks under the pressure of the 
upstream water, large volumes of water may inundate downstream locations 
(Lawford et al., 1995). 
<P><B><I>Snowmelt Floods</I></B> <BR>Though snowmelt causes most spring flooding 
in Canada, its very gradualness means that it results in few large floods. 
However, in northern and mountainous regions with heavy winter snowfall, snow 
melt combined with abnormally high temperatures, or when snow melt is combined 
with major rainfall, serious hazards can develop. Snow melt also supplies much 
of the water that produces many ice-jam floods (Lawford et al., 1995).
