      investigate these questions, we undertook a two-part analysis of fires 
      that have burned this summer in the western United States. First, we 
      analyzed the extents of all fires burning in the western United States 
      (from July 4 to August 22) in relation to historic fire trends, land 
      ownership and management.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In 
      the second part of our assessment, we conducted a landscape-level analysis 
      of eleven of the largest fires that have burned this summer to gain 
      insight on the overall fire situation. The fires that we chose have also 
      received the majority of the media attention directed at wildfires. Our 
      choice of this set of wildfires was based on overall area burned, wildfire 
      containment costs and availability of data.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Our analysis relied on existing

      <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent3 style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The current (August 
      30, 2000) nationwide wildfire-area total is approximately 6.6 million 
      acres. When viewed in the perspective of the period from 1916 to 1999, the 
      total acreage burned this year is still well below the average (13.9 
      million acres) for the last century.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>During the last 100 years, individual fires sometimes exceeded 3 
      million acres.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In fact, some 
      of the country burning today burned in the 3-million-acre Great Idaho fire 
      of 1910 (sometimes referred to as the Big Burn of 1910).<SPAN

      total is not excessively high compared to the long-term average for the 
      last century, fire activity does seem to be especially high in some 
      regions (northern Rockies and Texas) and of greater severity than most 
      firefighters have experienced in the recent past. La Niña and its 
      influence on weather patterns this year resulted in a combination of dry 
      fuels and dry, hot weather. This resulted in a situation where record-low 
      fuel moistures have developed across much of the West. These weather 
      conditions contributed to a wildland fire season that began early, became 
      intense, and is expected to last unusually long.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Only 31% 
      of the nationwide-burn area<B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">

      </SPAN>Overlay of burn area boundaries derived from AVHRR heat signatures 
      with Wilderness, US Forest Service Inventoried Roadless Areas, and 
      National Forest boundaries revealed that 62% of the fires in the Western 
      United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) were burning in roaded areas 
      on National Forests or outside the National Forests on other ownerships 
      during the period for which heat signatures were available.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Nationwide, a large amount of the 
      total fire acreage consists of grassland, shrub-steppe, chaparral, juniper 
      woodlands, sagebrush or some other land cover types where forest thinning 
      is not an option. Our initial estimate, as of August 30, 2000, is that 
      only about 500,000 acres of the area burned this year (about 8% of the 
      6.6-million-acre nationwide burn total) consists of dry forests on 
      National Forest land. There is growing consensus that in these dry 
      forests, fire exclusion policies have created unnatural conditions that 
      may have led to more severe wildfires. The remaining 92% of the area 
      burned so far this year represent areas where federal forest thinning 
      operations may either be entirely inappropriate (not federal ownership or 
      non-forested land) or in forest types where there is much less consensus 
      about the benefits of thinning operations.<O:P> </O:P></P>

      fire complex currently burning in the United States. These fires started 
      in a roaded landscape managed for grazing and timber production and burned 
      primarily through US Forest Service and Darby Lumber Company land. 
      Eventually, the fires spread into US Forest Service Inventoried Roadless 
      Areas and Wilderness. As of August 21, 2000, 74% of the burn was in roaded 
      and developed areas. Many areas within the complex have previously burned

      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">There is 
      great variability in historic fire regimes that coincides with the great 
      diversity of vegetation types present on the landscape. The ecological 
      effects of wildfire exclusion policies have also varied considerably with 
      vegetation type and landscape condition. While it is tempting to try to 
      develop simple solutions to the wildfire issue, it is likely that such 
      solutions may not aid in resolving the complex issues surrounding wildfire 
      and forest management. The wildfires analyzed in this report span a wide

      near the zone that is dominated by dry forests that have been greatly 
      altered by both fire exclusion and past logging. Both of these management 
      influences have created a situation <SPAN

      worst fire danger right where it endangers people the most. Part of the 
      solution to this problem is increased use of prescribed fire in many 
      western landscapes. Thinning of dense stands of <SPAN

      </SPAN>in strategic locations to create a defensible space around

      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The 
      perspective that has dominated the current wildfire discussion is that it 
      is a disaster that so much area has burned. <SPAN 
      style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">However,</SPAN> there is 
      another perspective, which understands that wildfire is a critical process 
      of a healthy, ecosystem. The wildfires that burned in most roadless <SPAN 
      style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">and wilderness areas</SPAN> 
      this year (and in past years) should certainly be viewed in this light. 
      After the smoke clears and profuse wildflowers bloom in many burned areas, 
      recognition will start to grow again that many of the wildfires may have 
      enhanced the environment rather than harming it and certainly did no great 
      harm to our society. Many species, including some that are threatened or 
      endangered, are dependent on fire occurrence to improve habitat 
      conditions, recycle nutrients, and maintain diverse landscapes. <SPAN 
      style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">The</SPAN> fact that many of 
      our ecosystems will benefit from this year’s fire episode often is lost in 
      all the heat and smoke of public and political discourse.</P>
      <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent3 style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This does not imply 
      that we should neglect the protection of our communities and forego 
      attempts to reduce wildfire risks in appropriate places (as outlined 
      above). We need to accept that fire is part of our landscape (whether we 
      like it or not) and develop a sensible approach that focuses wildfire 
      risk-reduction measures and fire-fighting efforts on a limited portion of 
      the landscape near human settlements. A large burden of responsibility 
      falls on the homeowner to design and maintain their property in a fashion 
      that will withstand wildfire. This study also points to the fact that many 
      wildfires do not involve forests. Prescribed burning and proper home 
      design and maintenance are the only solutions to protecting homes from 
      fire damage in situations where homes are surrounded by flammable grass 
      and shrublands.</P>
