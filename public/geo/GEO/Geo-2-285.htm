<H1 align=center>"Celebrating the <U>Wealth</U> of Africa"</H1><B>
<P align=center>Remarks at the Official Banquet of the US National Summit on 
Africa<BR>Friday, February 18, 2000</P>
<P align=center>By Callisto Madavo, Vice President, Africa Region, World 
Bank</P>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P></B>
<P>Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I am very proud to be with you this evening – as an African and as the World 
Bank’s Vice President for Africa. But, tonight, I am also speaking on behalf of 
our President, Jim Wolfensohn, who has made Africa a personal priority in his 
nearly five years of leading our institution. He intended to be here this 
evening. But he is on a trip to East Asia.</P>
<P>He asked me to convey to you – and to the organizers of this Summit – his 
congratulations for bringing this two-year process of public consultations on 
Africa to this important stage. And he wanted me to assure you that we will be 
listening very closely to the insights and advice which this process will offer 
to international institutions like the World Bank where the US role and 
commitment to Africa’s development are absolutely critical.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Africa’s Wealth</H2>
<P>At the World Bank, our dream is of a world without poverty. The challenge of 
achieving that dream in Africa is very great. But, in a setting like this, I am 
more inclined – first – to celebrate the <B>wealth</B> of our continent. For 
there are, indeed, many assets that we can draw on. Not just minerals and 
forests. Not just the agriculture and water resources of the continent. And not 
just the scenery and wildlife which impress so many visitors to Africa.</P>
<P>I’m talking of the joy and tranquillity we find when we go home to Africa, 
the warmth of family, the strength of our traditions in the face of modern 
pressures, the habits of sharing and civil discourse, the social obligation not 
to leave anyone behind, particularly the weak, the elderly, and orphans, the 
notion of shared responsibility within the family and community, and the rich, 
rich arts which express the joy and community of being African.</P>
<P>In short, I’m talking of the vibrancy and resilience of our culture and the 
resourcefulness of our people.</P>
<P>This cultural and moral wealth is our inheritance as Africans. It is central 
to our character. And we hold it in trust for our children and their children. 
But it is also vital for increasing Africa’s material wealth and sharing it more 
widely.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Africa and the World Bank</H2>
<P>But why, you may ask, is someone from the World Bank talking about culture 
and tradition? Because for development to be meaningful for everyone, for it to 
be true and sustainable, it must be anchored in this culture. And, if we lose 
that anchor, we are in peril as a people.</P>
<P>The World Bank has been working with Africa for a very long time and we have 
made an important contribution to its development. We have also made some 
mistakes – but all of us, including African countries and our partners, have 
learned a great deal in the process.</P>
<P>We made our first loan to Africa – to Ethiopia – in 1951 and since then have 
lent Sub-Saharan Africa more than $60 billion – most of that interest-free. 
Today, we are the largest source of multilateral development assistance to 
Africa. We are also the largest single group of specialists in the world serving 
Africa’s development. We are 1,400 people. Forty percent of us live and work on 
the continent. And sixty percent of us – 850 people – are African.</P>
<P>We are therefore not just a source of development finance but also a rich 
reservoir of development ideas and global knowledge. A large part of that 
knowledge has come from listening to what Africans have been telling us – and to 
what we have been feeling as Africans, trying to serve our continent from the 
vantage-point of an international institution, drawing on our own and on other 
countries’ experiences.</P>
<P>I believe that, because of that learning, the relationship between the World 
Bank and Africa has strengthened immensely in trust and honesty over the last 
five years – after a long period, particularly in the 1980s, when it was very 
hard for Africans to see how the policies we were advocating would help them 
directly.</P>
<P>We have traveled a long road together, and the year 2000 is a good time to 
take stock. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Africa’s Reforms</H2>
<P>Where <U>is</U> Africa on the road to economic and social progress?</P>
<P>Following the first oil crisis in 1973/74, Africa faced a quarter-century of 
shocks and setbacks. The easiest way to summarize the results is that, between 
1970 and 1995, Africa lost half its markets – to other developing countries. 
This represented a loss of income of about $70 billion a year.</P>
<P>Twenty-five years of setbacks cannot be reversed overnight. But, a major 
turning-point for Africa came in the early 1990s, when most African governments 
began to pursue programs of economic and social reform for their own reasons<B> 
</B>rather than because these were expected to do so by outsiders.</P>
<P>These reforms have begun to bear fruit in the last five years. Growth has 
returned to Africa. Roads are being repaired. New ones are being built. Markets 
are opening up. Africans are beginning to invest at home – rather than saving 
abroad. Talent is returning, too. And Africa is poised for a transformation – in 
both political and economic spheres – which even optimists would have been wary 
of predicting ten years ago.</P>
<P>There is, therefore, much to celebrate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Africa’s Priorities</H2>
<P>But this transformation brings a special – and enormous – challenge. </P>
<P>For Africa’s growth to be felt by many more Africans, it will need to be much 
stronger than the average 4% per year which we have seen in the second half of 
the 1990s. And it must be made more inclusive, through public policy oriented 
explicitly to helping the poor and the disadvantaged.</P>
<P>For that to happen, we need better governance, more capacity building and a 
monumental fight against HIV/AIDS.</P>
<P>There is no time, this evening, to go into great detail. But let me say just 
a few words on each of these topics.</P>
<P>When I refer to <B>governance</B>, I’m not just talking of elections and a 
free press, of clear and enforceable rules objectively applied, of standards of 
public information and accountability which will take the mystery – and some of 
the temptations – out of public management, and of rooting out corruption.</P>
<P>All of these are important – but I am also referring to:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Peace, security and stability (one in every five Africans still lives in 
    circumstances of civil conflict) 
    <LI>Decentralizing economic and political power 
    <LI>Moving beyond "participation" to empowerment 
    <LI>More community-driven development where the first order of business is 
    locally-felt needs and entrusting local leaders with the resources and 
    authority necessary to satisfy them, and 
    <LI>Regarding Africans as <U>subjects</U> rather than objects of 
    development.</LI></UL></UL>
<P>When I talk about <B>capacity-building</B>, it is not about constructing new 
institutions of learning – although some of that will certainly be needed. It is 
about:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Releasing – and using – the capacities already latent in society 
    <LI>Opening more space for private and community initiative 
    <LI>Allowing Africans to share their knowledge and experience more 
    successfully 
    <LI>Getting children back to school and keeping them healthy and challenged 
    while there, and 
    <LI>Harnessing the Internet and distance-learning to Africa’s 
needs.</LI></UL></UL>
<P>And, finally, all of us need to move beyond words and do something about 
<B>HIV/AIDS</B> every day.</P>
<P>We must raise it to the top of our national agendas. But putting it there 
will save few lives if it remains just a policy concern. We must translate this 
coming-to-terms with the disease into private and public actions which will 
protect our immediate families – and the national one.</P>
<P>There is nothing in African tradition which condemns us to silence and 
fatalism about this. HIV/AIDS is killing forty years of hard-won social progress 
and casting a shadow over the next twenty years. We must stop it before it 
deprives us of our wealth – that social and cultural fabric which I spoke of at 
the start, but also the material progress which Africans are beginning to 
experience at last.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>The United States and Africa</H2>
<P>Africa’s progress has been based on a clearer sense of what is important in 
national policy and a better reading of the different roles which the State, the 
private sector, communities and individuals can play in promoting growth and 
reducing poverty. Progress has also been based on Africans taking charge of 
their own futures. </P>
<P>But Africa cannot go it alone. It will need continued prominence on the 
global policy agenda. For some time yet, it will need well-targeted official 
development assistance of the kind which the International Development 
Association (IDA) and the African Development Fund (ADF) provide. It will need 
continued progress on debt relief. And it will need new markets – including 
openings in industrialized countries, such as those proposed in the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act.</P>
<P>In all these areas, the United States has opportunities – some would say 
obligations – to make a difference in Africa. US leadership in Africa will be an 
expression of that famous American confidence that equal opportunity and open 
markets, combined with a caring attitude to those who are in difficulty, can 
work wonders for everyone.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P></B>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>The elder whose life we have celebrated this evening – Julius Nyerere – 
dreamt large dreams and stuck to them in the face of many discouragements. He 
also spoke of edifices which need to be built a brick at a time.</P>
<P>We honor him and our other elders – living and historic – if we appreciate 
the gifts we already have, share those blessings with our children and other 
nations, and make every possible effort to match our rich cultural inheritance 
with a material progress which will touch every African life.</P>
<P>Thank you very much.</P>
