<H3>Period of Record</H3>
<P>1751-1998 
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Publications containing historical energy statistics make it possible to 
estimate fossil fuel CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions back to 1751. Etemad et al. (1991) 
published a summary compilation that tabulates coal, brown coal, peat, and crude 
oil production by nation and year. Footnotes in the Etemad et al.(1991) 
publication extend the energy statistics time series back to 1751. Summary 
compilations of fossil fuel trade were published by Mitchell (1983, 1992, 1993, 
1995). Mitchell's work tabulates solid and liquid fuel imports and exports by 
nation and year. These pre-1950 production and trade data were digitized and 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission calculations were made following the procedures 
discussed in Marland and Rotty (1984) and Boden et al. (1995). Further details 
on the contents and processing of the historical energy statistics are provided 
in Andres et al. (1999). 
<P>The 1950 to present CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission estimates are derived primarily 
from energy statistics published by the United Nations (2001), using the methods 
of Marland and Rotty (1984). The energy statistics were compiled primarily from 
annual questionnaires distributed by the U.N. Statistical Office and 
supplemented by official national statistical publications. As stated in the 
introduction of the <I>Statistical Yearbook</I>, "in a few cases, official 
sources are supplemented by other sources and estimates, where these have been 
subjected to professional scrutiny and debate and are consistent with other 
independent sources." Data from the U.S. Department of Interior's Geological 
Survey (USGS 2000) were used to estimate CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitted during cement 
production. Values for emissions from gas flaring were derived primarily from 
U.N. data but were supplemented with data from the U.S. Department of Energy's 
Energy Information Administration (1994), Rotty (1974), and data provided by G. 
Marland. Greater details about these methods are provided in Marland and Rotty 
(1984), Boden et al. (1995), and Andres et al. (1999).
