<H2 align=center>Water and Development in Africa</H2>
<H3 align=center>by Edwin B. Lake and Momar Souaré*</H3>
<P>Water is life. Without it, there can be no development. </P>
<P>Trading posts, which often became cities, were located on sea coasts, major 
rivers or lakes, or near other sources of water&nbsp;- not only for ease of 
transport, but because of the need for drinking water. As industrialization 
began, still more water was needed, for production processes and disposal of 
human and industrial wastes. Although the link between cities and bodies of 
water has been loosened by modern road and air transport, the need for water for 
drinking and sanitation continues to grow.</P>
<P>Rural development began where rainfall made agriculture possible (or, for a 
few fortunate civilizations, where water could be brought from elsewhere to 
allow irrigation). It has spread to other areas as dams were built to store 
water, or technology became available to tap deep aquifers (large, deep 
reservoirs of underground water).</P>
<P>Growing global population has increased the demand for water, for all its 
uses. In many places&nbsp;- especially in sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;- lack of 
available water is a limiting factor in development. And access to water 
resources is an emotional issue, with potential for conflict in the 21st century 
in much of the world, including North America.</P>
<P>This paper looks at global water issues, and some of the countless links with 
social and economic development. It also outlines specific considerations for 
sub-Saharan Africa, taking into account the socio-economic environment there and 
elsewhere in Africa, where the future of many countries is inextricably linked 
to the development and management of water resources.</P>
<P><B>The Decade and after</B></P>
<P>A quick review of recent efforts by the international community aids 
understanding of Africa's present situation.</P>
<P>On November 10, 1980, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 
1981-1990 as the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. The 
primary goal was full access to water supply and sanitation for all people in 
developing countries by 1990.</P>
<P>At the Decade's end, universal access had clearly not been achieved. 
Impressive gains in the number served were largely negated by population 
increases. But the Decade did succeed in many ways: in creating awareness, in 
developing workable strategies and models for sustainability, in introducing 
low-cost technologies, and in focusing attention on user communities as active 
participants&nbsp;- notably, on women's important role in water supply and 
sanitation.</P>
<P>As early as 1989, the OECD Council, drawing on lessons already learned from 
the Decade, urged members to review their institutional framework in the water 
sector. It asked them to pay special attention to rates, agreements, water 
rights, and unrecorded demand&nbsp;- in order to improve their policies for 
integrated resource management, the evolving trend in water sector 
development.</P>
<P>The International Water and Environment Conference (Dublin, 1992) presented 
new approaches to freshwater resources, emphasizing integrated management of 
basins and protection of ecosystems with full attention to the environment, both 
economic and social. Beyond viewing water as an economic commodity, it 
postulated that management must be participatory, involving all stakeholders at 
all levels, and must recognize women's important role in supplying water and 
managing watersheds, especially in the developing countries. The Dublin 
Conference also looked at the need for reform in the sector and provided the 
basis for the chapter on water in Agenda 21 of the UN Conference on Environment 
and Development.</P>
<P>In 1993, the World Bank published a sector document defining new objectives, 
and the FAO set the parameters for a program of action on water and sustainable 
development. Various international organizations are working on, and 
coordinating, special programs on water resources and appropriate technologies. 
And many other players have been active; Montreal has hosted three gatherings in 
the '90s&nbsp;- a meeting of NGOs in 1990 to discuss water supply and hygiene, 
the 1996 International Forum of Partner Cities for integrated water management, 
and 1997's IXth World Water Congress on "Water Resources Outlook for the 21st 
Century: Conflicts and Opportunities".</P>
<P>Although the major thrust in water development is drinking water and 
sanitation, other uses are important, too. Water for industry often comes from, 
and is considered part of, the urban supply of potable water. And, while the 
expansion of irrigation has slowed in recent years, it continues&nbsp;- and is 
expected to increase in Africa in the new century.</P>
<P><B>How much water?</B></P>
<P>The world's total water resource is finite. Only about 2.5 per cent of it is 
fresh, and only a very small portion (0.3 per cent) of the fresh water is 
renewable through the normal hydrologic cycle of evaporation, condensation and 
precipitation&nbsp;- and thus is available for sustained use by humans.</P>
<P>Fortunately, water can be reused&nbsp;- in theory, indefinitely&nbsp;- but 
its quality deteriorates with each recycling. The practical limit depends on 
type of use, water management, available technology for treatment, and quality 
standards considered acceptable. Management systems in Africa generally do not 
rely heavily on reuse.</P>
<P>Africa's total available water resource seems impressive, but is actually 
inadequate for a vast continent with high evaporation and a fast-rising 
population. Average annual flow is over 4000 billion cubic metres, and includes 
the world's longest river (the Nile) and its second-largest in terms of basin 
and flow (the Congo). The wet equatorial zone (mainly the central and 
southwestern countries) produces 95 per cent of Africa's total flow, while the 
arid and semi-arid zones produce only 5 per cent&nbsp;- although rivers (such as 
the Nile, Niger, Senegal, Chari, Zambesi and Orange) originating in wetter 
places and flowing into or through arid zones redress this imbalance somewhat, 
essentially doubling the resources available in the dry areas.</P>
<P>Underground water represents 15 per cent of Africa's resource. The major 
aquifers are in arid zones of the northern Sahara, Nubia, Sahel and Chad basins, 
and the Kalahari. In semi-arid zones, rural people meet some of their needs from 
shallow, discontinuous, unproductive aquifers that are depleted in times of 
drought. The equatorial zone contains many local aquifers that can be tapped 
directly, but their importance is dwarfed by high rainfall and abundant surface 
water.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Africa's water is distributed unevenly, and the imbalance is 
huge. Of 46 countries studied, 13 (each with annual flows above 100 billion 
cubic metres) account for about 80 per cent of total available water, while 12 
countries (each with less than 10 billion cubic metres) together have only 1 per 
cent of the resource. This inequality is even more striking on the basis of per 
capita availability&nbsp;- which varies from over 136,000 cubic metres for each 
person in Gabon, to less than 200 in Libya. The comparable figure for Canada is 
about 100,000.</P>
<P>Where rivers cross borders, a certain level of interdependency may exist 
between riparian (river-bank) countries, such as Egypt, Sudan, Niger, 
Mauritania, Chad, Congo, Botswana, Mozambique and others. Shared resources can 
lead to conflict, or to cooperation in neighbours' economic or industrial 
development strategies. Full cooperation is essential to maximize benefits: the 
entire river basin must be studied as a unit to get a clear idea of the extent 
of the resource, its inflows and outflows, how to protect it from pollution, and 
its potential for further development.</P>
<P>The Nile basin shows how complex this can be. Egypt and Sudan have a formal 
accord for sharing the flow, but there are no agreements with the other 
riparians. Recently, annual 'Nile 2002' conferences, sponsored by CIDA and other 
donors, have brought together experts from all the countries involved. The 
resulting dialogue and research lays a foundation for future sharing and 
development of this valuable resource. CIDA is participating in similar 
initiatives for the Zambesi basin.</P>
<P><B>How is water used?</B></P>
<P><I>Human consumption and sanitation</I> is the most important use of water, 
though it takes only 10 per cent of available supply. Access to safe, clean 
water and effective sanitation is vital to improving human health and 
well-being, especially for the poor&nbsp;- but only 10 per cent of investment 
during the Decade went to Africa, services lagged behind population growth, and 
the continent trails other regions in improvements in this sector, with many 
millions of people still lacking access. This causes particular hardship for 
women in many countries, given their important role in providing water for the 
household and caring for the ill, elderly and young.</P>
<P>After basic services are provided, people continue to demand more and better 
water as their economic situation improves. Orloci et al. have shown, however, 
that industrial and urban withdrawals increase with rising GNP up to a certain 
point, then level off and decline&nbsp;- perhaps because usage changes from 
extensive to intensive, and technological alternatives allow more efficient 
water use.</P>
<P>Globally, <I>irrigation</I> is the largest consumer of water, taking an 
estimated 70 per cent, with the remainder going for human use (drinking and 
sanitation), recreational and other purposes (proportions varying from place to 
place). Irrigation likely takes a smaller share in Africa, where only 7 per cent 
of cropland is irrigated, compared to 17 per cent worldwide.</P>
<P>Irrigated land generated more than half the increase in global food 
production from the mid-'60s to the mid-'80s, and currently accounts for about 
one-third of total production. The FAO predicts irrigation in developing 
countries will expand at 0.8 per cent annually, slower than the 1.9 per cent 
rate in the '80s. Even so, more than half the increase in crop production from 
now to 2010 will come from irrigated land. The rate of expansion in Africa is 
expected to be higher because of land availability and the low starting point. 
The development of water resources will need to keep pace with this expansion of 
irrigation.<I></I></P>
<P><I>Industrialization </I>in Africa is below the world average, and grew only 
sluggishly in the '80s and '90s, but restructuring and an improving investment 
climate should mean more growth in the new century&nbsp;- growth that will bring 
demand for more and better water (although, without proper controls, it could 
also reduce the availability of unpolluted water).</P>
<P>Industrialization will also require more power, much of which may come from 
<I>hydroelectricity</I> in suitably endowed countries. Africa's installed 
capacity to generate electricity is 35 GW, with hydro-power providing 11 
GW&nbsp;- half in North Africa, the other half evenly divided between East and 
West Africa. It is estimated that the continent has 35 per cent of the world's 
untapped hydro potential, two-thirds of it in East and Southern Africa. Only 3.4 
per cent has been developed (including 63 per cent of North Africa's potential) 
so there is scope for hydroelectricity to meet growing industrial and urban 
demand in some parts of Africa.</P>
<P><I>Water </I>is not consumed in hydro-power generation, though it may be 
changed. It flows downstream and, with careful coordination, can be 
reused&nbsp;- as in Egypt, where release from the Aswan High Dam is based mainly 
on irrigation demand, but is also sufficient to meet hydro and navigation 
requirements.</P>
<P><I>Gold mining</I>, important in many parts of Africa, can devastate water 
resources. Mercury or cyanide in waste water can damage ecosystems and pollute 
large volumes of water.</P>
<P><I>Protecting the environment </I>is increasingly recognized as a priority. 
Many of Africa's unique ecosystems are already endangered, such as wetlands and 
lakes that support flora and fauna, and are important in development and the 
rural economy. Wetlands occupy some 200 million hectares, including the 
regularly inundated deltas of large rivers. Seasonally flooded areas&nbsp;- 
<I>dambos</I> in South Africa, <I>fadamas </I>in Nigeria, and <I>bani </I>in 
Mali&nbsp;- over their cycles provide fish, pasture, crops, and habitat for 
fauna. Natural areas, particularly wetlands, are vital for recharging the 
groundwater 'stock' on which many people, especially in Africa, depend. Vast 
plains and woodlands hold a wide array of animals, whose ranges are shrinking as 
agricultural and other development expands, with wildlife reserves attracting 
tourists and contributing to the economy.</P>
<P>Water is needed to maintain ecosystems&nbsp;- but this key requirement is 
often neglected in resource planning.</P>
<P><B>Problems and challenges</B></P>
<P><I>Population growth&nbsp;</I>- an unrelenting 3 per cent a year, with little 
sign of imminent reduction&nbsp;- is a major factor in Africa's water situation, 
which is further compounded by rapid urbanization (even worse in Africa than 
elsewhere in the developing world). Populations in cities such as Nairobi, Dar 
es Salaam, Lagos and Kinshasa increased sevenfold from 1950 to 1980, while in 
Latin America comparable cities grew half as fast. Population growth and 
urbanization are at the heart of many of Africa's problems.</P>
<P>More people need more food&nbsp;- but, in much of sub-Saharan Africa, 
countries and people cannot afford imported food, and food requirements are near 
or beyond the existing capacity of rainfed agriculture. Boosting this capacity 
is a long-term proposition, so irrigation is essential&nbsp;- with agricultural 
water demand linked to food security strategies. To balance the food deficit, 
production must rise by an estimated 3.3 per cent annually until 2025&nbsp;- but 
even if it were possible to triple Africa's irrigated area, in order to grow 
more food, the available water resource would come under severe stress. 
Strategies must be found to optimize water use, including improved efficiency, 
reuse of drainage and waste water, and coordinated use of surface and 
groundwater.</P>
<P><I>Water shortages</I> are a growing problem in many parts of the world. To 
meet the needs of people and the environment, renewable freshwater resources of 
1700 cubic metres annually per capita are considered adequate. Below that, 
supplies are short: a figure between 1700 and 1000 means water stress, while 
less than 1000 represents water scarcity.</P>
<P>Globally, in 1950 only 12 countries with 20 million people faced water 
shortages of some sort. By 1990, it was 26 countries (14 in Africa) and 300 
million people. Up to 65 countries (32 in Africa) will face shortages by 
2050&nbsp;- after which the world's population is expected to stabilize.</P>
<P align=center><IMG align=bottom height=8 src="Geo-2-103_files/line.gif"

<P align=center><IMG align=bottom height=188 src="" width=259 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></P>
<P align=center><IMG align=bottom height=8 src="Geo-2-103_files/line.gif" 
width=502 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>
<P>Such numbers do not take into account variations in place and time (dry 
seasons, rapid runoff, geographic features, usage patterns in different areas). 
In reality, actual shortages are worse than national averages would indicate, 
and an 'adequate' figure cannot justify complacency.</P>
<P><I>Drinking water and sanitation</I> needs are still largely unmet in many 
African countries, despite efforts during and since the Decade. At its end, only 
63 per cent of urban and 35 per cent of rural people were served with potable 
water, and 56 per cent of urban and 30 per cent of rural people with 
sanitation&nbsp;- meaning nearly 400 million people, more than half the total 
population, had no access to safe drinking water, and even more lacked sanitary 
facilities. The impact on women is particularly severe.</P>
<P>Efforts to broaden access by supplying low-cost water often backfire: systems 
that generate too little revenue for <I>maintenance and expansion</I> fail to 
spread to the poorer, peri-urban fringe and may begin to deteriorate. The poor 
suffer most: forced to buy water from private distributors, they often pay more 
than the rich living in well-supplied areas.</P>
<P>Sewage facilities always seem to be lower-priority than water, leaving more 
than 460 million Africans without proper sanitation. Treatment is usually 
rudimentary in cities, and sewage networks incomplete or absent in peri-urban 
zones, with most households relying on septic tanks or other units that can 
contaminate ground water. In Senegal, 76 per cent of the urban and peri-urban 
population use individual disposal units, and figures for the rest of Africa are 
likely similar.</P>
<P>Lack of clean water and sanitation makes people sick&nbsp;- thus adding to 
the workload of women, who may spend many hours a day collecting contaminated 
water. Water-related diseases kill an estimated three million Africans each 
year, while also taking a hidden toll in lost productivity.</P>
<P>Pollution caused by humans is contaminating lakes, rivers and underground 
water&nbsp;- reducing quality, limiting regeneration of freshwater ecosystems, 
and complicating treatment of water for domestic use. Industry, agriculture and 
inadequate sewage treatment are intensifying pollution, making reclamation of 
some water costly or impossible, thereby diminishing an essential resource.</P>
<P>Groundwater resources present special problems, more difficult and less 
researched than the issues around surface water. Drought or unsustainable use 
can deplete aquifers, putting people at risk. Groundwater contamination&nbsp;- 
for instance, from urban waste disposal&nbsp;- is very hard to track and costly 
to remedy. Groundwater and surface water problems, qualitatively different, 
require different management strategies.</P>
<P><I>Desertification and erosion</I> threaten much of Africa. Rainfall has been 
declining in some Sahelian areas by about 10 mm yearly&nbsp;- maybe as part of a 
long-term cycle, or perhaps permanently. If such trends continue, and 
predictions of global climate change come true, the march of desertification may 
make some of the region's aquifers unusable.</P>
<P>Erosion&nbsp;- due to desertification, topography, bad agriculture, and high 
rainfall&nbsp;- makes land less productive and eventually not fit for farming. 
This increases pressure on good land, encourages use of marginal land (itself 
usually erosion-prone), and leads to expansion of irrigation, which puts further 
pressure on limited water resources. Erosion also shortens the useful life of 
reservoirs, filling lakes and ponds. In Kenya, sedimentation is cutting the 
lifespan of dams, reducing storage capacity, and impairing water supply 
downstream. On the other side of the continent, the Ibohamane and Mouela 
reservoirs on the Niger River are reported to have lost half their capacity 
because of siltation over the past 15 years.</P>
<P><I>Debt</I> limits development options, and most African countries&nbsp;- 
beset by high national debts&nbsp;- find it impossible to invest enough 
resources in water and sanitation.</P>
<P><B>What can be done?</B></P>
<P>African countries facing water shortages must solve huge, vexing problems 
that can have spill-over effects on countries with more adequate resources. To 
avert the impending crisis, water resource development needs to proceed on an 
unprecedented scale. It must provide enough water to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>satisfy the needs for drinking water and sanitation; 
  <LI>increase irrigation to help achieve food security; 
  <LI>meet growing industrial demand; 
  <LI>preserve and enhance the environment. </LI></UL>
<P>The challenge is all the greater, when the Decade's 'old agenda' still awaits 
completion&nbsp;- but the objectives can be reached, given massive efforts, by 
all concerned, without delay and continuing until stability is achieved and the 
threat of water shortages is eliminated. A role is waiting for everyone, and the 
involvement of all stakeholders is essential.</P>
<P><I>The people&nbsp;</I>- from all walks of life, in the various 
countries&nbsp;- must participate. Professionals, technicians, business people, 
farmers, labourers and the unemployed need to take a positive interest in 
solving the water crisis. Women and men, as users of water, can assert their 
needs and advise on solutions, so they are integrated into policies and plans. 
Conservation and protection of the resource depends on individuals, who must 
take ownership and responsibility, rather than seeing programs as foreign aid 
exercises. Governments should behave in a way that reinforces this sense of 
ownership in the people.</P>
<P><I>Governments</I> of affected countries must recognize the urgency and 
gravity of the situation, make water problems the top priority, commit resources 
and show leadership in mobilizing their people to tackle the problem, starting 
with water conservation.</P>
<P>Governments must also:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>cooperate in developing shared resources as a unit, 
  <LI>exercise proper control over funds entrusted to them, 
  <LI>ensure fair distribution of benefits, so that all will feel they have a 
  stake in the program. </LI></UL>
<P>Good governance goes beyond fiscal responsibility to embrace all aspects of 
how a government treats its citizens, including civil rights. Preventing the 
water crisis will be a difficult undertaking, and does not need the added burden 
of bad governance&nbsp;- which consumes like a raging fire, devouring the fuel 
for development, stifling innovation and creativity, leaving behind apathy and 
despair. Good governance, on the other hand, allows people to hope, to develop, 
and to solve the problems menacing them.</P>
<P><I>External support agencies</I> must come to Africa's aid far more than 
recently. The international community must provide assistance&nbsp;- money, 
technical help, training and advice&nbsp;- on a long-term basis, through 
multi-year development plans endorsed by all parties. Planning needs to 
incorporate more adequately socio-economic factors, and each country's special 
characteristics, so that initiatives will be better appreciated by the people, 
the ultimate guardians of the resource and beneficiaries of development.</P>
<P>Water resources are often shared&nbsp;- by individuals, communities, 
nations&nbsp;- so cooperation is needed for rational development of the river 
basin as a natural unit, and for optimum long-term use of the resource. External 
agencies can sometimes exert leverage to promote the spirit and the essential 
institutions of such cooperation.</P>
<P><I>The private sector</I> can finance and manage many aspects of water sector 
development&nbsp;- as happens in much of the developed world, where irrigation 
systems, water supplies and sewage plants are often privately owned and 
operated. The private sector may have quicker access to capital and more 
incentives to efficiency, leading to better maintenance and greater response to 
clients' evolving needs&nbsp;- although government or parastatal agencies can 
also be run efficiently.</P>
<P>Actions to defuse the crisis are many, are not simple, and are different for 
each country (but must be coordinated where countries share a common basin or 
aquifer to optimize use, prevent over-exploitation, and minimize conflict). Some 
required actions are short-term, but can lay the foundation for long-term 
activities.</P>
<P>Some basic elements of a Water Action Plan to deal with the crisis 
include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>forming an Action Committee 
  <LI>securing water resources 
  <LI>assessing and planning institutions 
  <LI>implementing conservation policies 
  <LI>rehabilitating existing infrastructure 
  <LI>creating new infrastructure 
  <LI>involving stakeholders in water issues. </LI></UL>
<P><I>Action Committee</I></P>
<P>A high-level body is needed, with legislated powers to control water use and 
enforce anti-pollution laws. It should be the only body in charge of overall 
water resources, but may delegate lower-level control. It should also ensure 
that the water sector has a comprehensive set of institutions to manage and 
develop the resource.</P>
<P>The committee should be responsible for long-range and strategic planning, 
project approval, and recommendations on legislation. It should assess current 
strategies, meld the good ones into the new action plan, and become the focal 
point for cooperation with other countries sharing the same resources.</P>
<P>Representation is crucial. The committee must have the confidence of the 
communities served and must be multi-faceted, like the problems to be solved. 
Members, rotated regularly, should include planners, economists, water 
specialists, users, business leaders, and representatives of the whole 
population whose well-being is at stake&nbsp;- including women, the primary 
gatherers of water, who suffer most when access erodes.</P>
<P>This high-level body should be supplemented by lower-level water committees, 
to give initiatives local roots and ensure broad representation and 
participation.</P>
<P><I>Funding</I></P>
<P>Projects approved under the Action Plan must be carried out promptly. Funds 
secured, locally or externally, should be kept separate from the rest of 
government, with a streamlined disbursement system and proper accounting 
safeguards.</P>
<P><I>Resource assessment</I></P>
<P>As the first step to rational development, a country must assess its 
resources&nbsp;- the quantity and quality of available surface and ground water, 
amount that can safely be taken from aquifers, amount needed to maintain 
ecosystems. Assessments depend on long-term data (on rainfall and other 
variables), relatively scarce in Africa&nbsp;- but incomplete records are better 
than none. High priority should go to the country's hydrometric network 
(coverage, equipment and trained staff).</P>
<P><I>Institutional assessment</I></P>
<P>The water sector needs a full set of institutions to deal with all aspects of 
use. The Action Committee's mandate should cover legislation, policy, 
macro-planning, control and coordination. Other institutions should handle 
research, municipal services, pollution, training, and user organizations. 
Mandates should be complementary, minimizing overlap but encouraging linkages 
that contribute to synergy, knowledge-sharing, coordination, and 
non-duplication. Assessments should deal with each institution's mandate, 
structure, management, staffing, training, facilities and funding, so that 
financial resources can go where most needed.</P>
<P><I>Conservation policies</I></P>
<P>Some low-cost policies can quickly make water go further: realistic pricing, 
to reduce use and generate revenue (with concern shown for ability to pay); 
reuse of irrigation and drainage water; reduction of pollution. Research to 
improve irrigation efficiency should be an early priority, while research on 
rain-fed crops (efficient water use, higher yields) can ease demand for expanded 
irrigation.</P>
<P><I>Rehabilitation of infrastructure</I></P>
<P>Improving existing systems can be a cost-effective way to serve communities. 
Approaches include repairing irrigation controls, lining canals, repairing water 
supply pipes, fixing broken valves (such as shut-off valves on public 
standpipes) and ensuring good maintenance.</P>
<P><I>New infrastructure</I></P>
<P>While short-term measures are being carried out to conserve water, planning 
for new infrastructure should proceed, as conservation alone will not meet 
future needs.</P>
<P><I>Involving stakeholders</I></P>
<P>The Action Plan must involve all stakeholders&nbsp;- including end-users, 
particularly women. Campaigns, meetings and seminars can build public awareness 
of the crisis and solutions. All sectors should contribute inputs to planning, 
and help to conserve water and reduce pollution.</P>
<P>Even countries blessed with currently adequate water supplies need to manage 
their resources for the good of future generations. There are still people 
lacking basic services, and strategies&nbsp;- national, regional and 
international&nbsp;- must be continually defined for sustainable development of 
water resources to meet the needs of people, industry and the environment far 
into the next millennium.</P>
<P>A water crisis is gathering momentum year by year. It will hit some harder 
than others&nbsp;- in general the poor (particularly poor women), especially in 
water-short countries, above all in Africa. It will inevitably grow more 
intense&nbsp;- because of population increase, urbanization, industrialization, 
pollution, probable climate change, degradation of land and water (for instance, 
Lake Chad), and the rising cost of infrastructure...and because the best, most 
accessible resources are already largely exploited.</P>
<P>This growing problem threatens every aspect of human well-being and all the 
foundations of development&nbsp;- health, food security, social development, 
ecological integrity. In the long term it must be dealt with, and the longer 
action is delayed the greater will be the cost.</P>
<P>To prevent the crisis, even to minimize its destructive impact, will take an 
unprecedented level of action, involvement, and commitment, by all parts of 
society, from political leaders to the citizens of slums. But a great deal can 
be done&nbsp;- by applying human intelligence, adequate resources, scientific 
capacity, and skilful management, and by enlisting leadership, creativity, 
enlightened self-interest, and broad participation in the effort to defend the 
future. And it must be done: where there is no water, there can be no life, and 
certainly no development.</P>
