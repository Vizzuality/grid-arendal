size=5>T</FONT>he introduction of exotic plants to North America dates to the 
earliest arrivals of explorers and settlers to the New World. <IMG align=right 
border=4 src="Geo-2-080_files/canalien.gif"> Their ships were laden with a wide 
variety of pest seeds and cultivated species that would eventually escape the 
confines of gardens and agricultural fields. Weed seeds were hidden in natural 
packing materials, in bales of hay and were present as contaminants in seeds and 
grains used as fodder and for planting. They were also in the soil of rooted 
transplants used for establishing new gardens and orchards. The ballast of 
merchant ships dumped at the harbours of the colonies contained large quantities 
of weed seeds. Some of the herbs brought for cooking and medicines and even some 
favourite garden ornamentals, in time, were also to become troublesome pests. 
Such exotic pests are considered to be weeds - they are plants that grow where 
they are not wanted and that have objectionable characteristics, such as 
aggressive growth in agricultural lands, home gardens and roadsides or possess 
noxious properties that cause allergic reactions or poisoning if the plants are 
eaten. 
<P><FONT size=5>A</FONT> succession of stowaways and deliberate introductions 
reached Canadian soils from overseas and overland from established centres to 
the south over the course of several hundred years. Once locally established, 
the ever-enlarging woodland clearings and fields that were opened through 
logging and agricultural expansion aided the spread of exotic species. The 
developing system of roadways, railways and canals facilitated the spread of 
exotic plants to remote interior destinations. The desire to beautify city 
streets and parks with graceful and hardy European and Eurasian trees and shrubs 
also contributed to the spread of exotic species whose aggressive nature and 
ability to disperse widely was not anticipated. The use of European forage 
grasses in North American pastures and prairies and the practice of seeding 
exotic grasses for erosion control has led to the widespread distribution and 
dominance of such species. 
<P><FONT size=5>T</FONT>he once common practice of using farm manure, loaded 
with viable weed seeds, as fertilizer for city gardens also contributed to the 
establishment of agricultural weeds in cities. In more recent years, the large 
numbers of people involved in recreational activities such as auto touring, 
hiking, boating and in developing and beautifying cottage properties have 
contributed to the spread of exotic plants across most of Canada's terrestrial 
ecosystems. Changing land use, as well, has resulted in numerous, formerly 
marginal, agricultural lands being left idle and susceptible to the 
establishment and spread of weedy species, some of which are a threat to natural 
habitats. It is these exotic plants that have been spreading aggressively and 
invading native habitats that are of particular concern because of their impact 
on natural ecosystems. 
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Extent of the Problem</FONT></B></CENTER><FONT 
size=5>T</FONT>he flora of Canada consists of about 4200 species (Scoggan 
1978-1979). Exotic plants make up approximately 30% of the total flora. The 
numbers of these non-indigenous plants in different regions and provinces in 
Canada is a reflection of a variety of factors that influence the introduction 
and spread of exotic plants. Some of these factors include: climate; diversity 
in floristic zones and habitats; historical land use; extent of agricultural 
land use and diversity in agricultural practices; frequency of transportation, 
communication and power corridors; frequency of lakes and rivers; density of 
populated places; population size and historical immigration movements in the 
settling of Canada. 
<P><FONT size=5>I</FONT>n a large province such as Ontario that has several 
floristic regions and a diverse agricultural base in the southern portion of the 
province has a flora of 2900 species, including nearly 960 exotics (Morton &amp; 
Venn 1990). These non-indigenous species represent about 30% of the flora of 
Ontario. Southern, and especially southwestern Ontario, contains only a fragment 
of the deciduous and mixed forests that once covered its soils. This region of 
the province, and in fact the whole Mixedwood Plains Ecozone that encompasses 
southern Ontario and the St. Lawrence Lowlands, is now a haven for exotic 
species. These have taken advantage of the extensive agricultural lands that 
were developed on the rich soils of formerly forested regions and the disturbed 
woodlands, prairies and wetlands that remain as a consequence of development 
within an area with a large population base. 
<P><FONT size=5>I</FONT>n contrast, the province of Alberta, with an overall 
much lower floral diversity of about 1750 species, also has fewer exotic 
species. These represent only about 16% of the flora (Moss 1983). The lower 
percentage of weeds present in this province is a reflection of a number of 
factors. These include: the presence of large areas of relatively undisturbed 
mountain and boreal coniferous forests, a more northern and continental climate, 
a less diverse agricultural base, as compared with Ontario, and fewer cities and 
towns in which to develop local centres for the establishment of exotic plants. 
These factors all contribute to the lower numbers of exotics present in the 
Alberta flora. 
<P><FONT size=5>M</FONT>any weedy species in southern Canada are natives of open 
habitats from the northern United States that have expanded their range into 
Canada (Muenscher 1935). The largest proportion of weedy exotics are from other 
continents. The non-indigenous plants of concern in natural habitats are 
primarily European and Eurasian in origin. They represent a spectrum of growth 
and life forms including aquatics and terrestrial herbs, vines, shrubs and trees 
and annual, biennial and perennial species. 
<P><FONT size=5>T</FONT>he Canadian Wildlife Service publication on Invasive 
Plants by White et al. (1993) was the first attempt to compile information, on a 
national basis, of non-indigenous plants considered to be invasive in natural 
habitats in Canada. The publication provided information on six principal and 
ten minor exotics of wetland habitats. Invasive plants of upland sites treated 
in this publication included three categories: principal invasives (4), 
moderately invasive plants (5) and species (or species groups) that were 
considered to be minor invasives in natural habitats (31). 
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Centres of Establishment</FONT></B></CENTER><FONT 
size=5>T</FONT>he majority of exotic plants are primarily roadside and 
agricultural weeds or horticultural escapes. In their European or Eurasian 
haunts they became adapted over several millenia to habitats influenced by human 
activities and were kept in check by native herbivors and disease organisms. In 
their newly adopted homes in North America, they found conditions similar to 
those of their former homelands. In the majority of cases, these exotics became 
established in and around, harbours, urban centres and adjoining agricultural 
and forested regions. The altered city woodlands, ravines and urban habitats 
served as havens for the estasblishment of many exotic species. From local 
centres of infestations, the most aggressive species, given time and increasing 
availability of habitats, spread throughout the countryside aided by human 
activities. A smaller number of these exotics, because of their preferred growth 
in woodlands and wetlands or because of their highly aggressive nature as 
grasses of pastures and meadows, found their way into natural habitats. 
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Impact of Invasive Exotics</FONT></B></CENTER><FONT 
size=5>W</FONT>hen invasive exotics become established in natural woodlands, 
prairies and wetlands they affect native species in a variety of ways. The 
establishment of an aggressive exotic plant into a natural habitat reduces the 
biological diversity at the site. This occurs when native plants are eliminated 
by the proliferation of large numbers of an exotic plant that compete for the 
limited space, light and nutrients available for growth. Habitats that support a 
variety of plant species provide conditions suitable for a greater variety of 
animal life. When a single species dominates a site, it reduces the value of the 
habitat for other wildlife. In the case of purple loosestrife, its dominance in 
an area is particularly disruptive since the plant is of little benefit to 
native wildlife. Floating or submergent aquatics cause degraded water quality 
for domestic use and reduce the suitability of the water body for fish and other 
aquatic wildlife. Navigation can be affected dramatically by certain invasive 
aquatics such as Eurasian watermilfoil. Non-indigenous aquatic species can also 
reduce the recreational value of water bodies. 
<P><IMG align=right border=4 src="Geo-2-080_files/garlic.gif"> <FONT 
size=5>A</FONT> number of exotic plants have been implicated as significant 
threats to species designated at risk by the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in wetlands, prairies and woodland 
habitats. Garlic mustard (<I>Alliaria petiolata</I>), a woodland invasive, has 
been cited as a threat to the endangered wood poppy (<I>Stylophorum 
diphyllum</I>) and the threatened white wood aster (<I>Aster divaricatus</I>), 
both in Ontario. Crested wheat grass (<I>Agropyron pectiniforme</I>) has reduced 
the number of populations and available habitat for slender mouse-ear-cress 
(<I>Halimolobos virgata</I>) an endangered species in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Characteristics of Invasive 
Plants</FONT></B></CENTER><IMG align=left border=4 
src="Geo-2-080_files/frogsmal.gif"> <FONT size=5>I</FONT>nvasive non-indigenous 
plants of natural habitats generally exhibit the same kinds of biological 
characteristics as common weeds. They grow rapidly under a wide range of climate 
and soil conditions. Some, such as the biennial garlic mustard, overwinter as 
rosettes and begin to flower and set seed early in the spring before many of the 
native plants begin to grow. Most produce abundant seeds and also may have 
dissemination aids, such as long hairy plumes on the seeds (dog-strangling vine, 
<I>Vincetoxicum</I> spp.) that promote easy dispersal. Commonly, the seeds of 
weedy species stay viable for many years when buried in the soil. Many are 
perennial and reproduce by vegetative propagation (European frog-bit, 
<I>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae</I>) that enables them to form large clones of 
genetically identical plants adapted to local conditions. Some have a 
disagreeable taste or odour (leafy spurge, <I>Euphorbia esula</I>), or possess 
spines (Canada thistle, <I>Cirsium arvense</I>) or thorns (common buckthorn, 
<I>Rhamnus cathartica</I>) that reduce the degree of herbivory by insects or 
larger animals. Many also lack insect pests or pathogens in their adopted 
countries that could keep them under control. 
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Control of Invasive Plants</FONT></B></CENTER><FONT 
size=5>C</FONT>ontrol measures must be geared specifically for each exotic 
species with close attention being paid to minimize harm to other species. The 
biological characteristics of these non-indigenous species must also be taken 
into account so that control efforts do not promote their spread. Five main 
options are available for the control of invasive non-indigenous plants: <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>physical removal through uprooting or mechanical harvesting 
  <LI>controlled burning 
  <LI>herbicide application 
  <LI>biological agents 
  <LI>integrated pest management (a combination of several methods) </LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=5>P</FONT>hysical removal of plants is generally most effective 
for the eradication of small infestations. Special care may need to be taken 
when dealing with perennial species having widespread and deep underground roots 
and rootstocks (thistles). Fragmentation of these underground structures can 
promote the proliferation of the species. In other cases, such as with purple 
loosestrife, disturbance of the soil may result in bringing numerous weed seeds 
to the surface. Mechanical harvesting of aquatics such as Eurasian watermilfoil, 
although resulting in fragmentation of plants, may at times be a necessity where 
the plants physically inhibit the movement of small boat traffic in major 
waterways or hinder recreational activities. 
<P><FONT size=5>C</FONT>ontrolled burning is a practice generally used for 
removing woody plants that are encroaching into habitats such as prairies and 
alvars. Extreme caution is required and should only be done with trained 
personnel. The use of chemical herbicides requires careful application of 
selective control agents applied under suitable conditions with personal and 
public safety in mind. Herbicides can be combined with mechanical removal of 
woody plants to eliminate shoot and root sprouts. Biological control agents are 
extensively tested prior to release to ensure that they are highly specific in 
attacking only the pest species. Organisms most commonly used as biocontrol 
agents are insects and plant pathogens.

<CENTER><B><FONT size=4>Monitoring Invasive Plants</FONT></B></CENTER><FONT 
size=5>A</FONT>n Invasive Plants of Canada (IPCAN) monitoring project, initially 
undertaken on behalf of the Canadian Wildlife Service, has been established as 
part of a Biodiversity Mapping Program (BIOMAP) through the support of several 
departments in Environment Canada, Canadian Heritage and Natural Resources 
Canada.<IMG align=right border=4 src="Geo-2-080_files/frogmpsm.gif"> The IPCAN 
project has been established for documenting information on the biology, range 
and control of invasive plants and for compiling databases for computer mapping 
and analysis of non-indigenous harmful plants. Data for inclusion in these 
national databases are derived from specimen records in national collections, 
from sight records made by naturalists and professional botanists and from 
published reports. These databases provide not only a historical perspective on 
the origins and rate of spread of invasives, but also provide valuable insights 
into possible correlations with climatic and environmental factors through 
geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. A national mail survey of 
specialists in biology, land management and weed control provides an overview of 
opinion on the extent to which invasive exotics affect natural habitats and 
leads to a better understanding of current problems in localized areas or 
regions. Species that may become of national or regional concern and that may 
require closer monitoring are identified through such surveys. 
<P><FONT size=5>T</FONT>he preparation of fact sheets on invasive non-indigenous 
plants is part of a program to inform the public and to develop resource 
documents promoting a better understanding of the problems associated with 
invasive exotic plants. The fact sheets also provide information and references 
that may be helpful to agencies requiring control options for curbing the spread 
of harmful non-indigenous plants.
