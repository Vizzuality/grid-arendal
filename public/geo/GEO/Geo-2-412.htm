<P>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the leading US agency 
charged with implementing US policies for the provision of food, fiber and 
forest products. This includes responsibility for research, development, and 
dissemination of knowledge about managed ecosystems and sustainable methods of 
producing food, fiber, and forest products. To accomplish this mission, the USDA 
works with many other groups including the President's Council on Sustainable 
Development, the National Science and Technology Council, the Committee on Food 
Safety and Health, other Federal agencies, State agricultural and forest 
experiment stations, State land-grant colleges and universities, extension 
services, non-profit organizations, among others. A number of associations and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOS) are involved in the process associated 
with USDA programmes as well as the legislative process pertaining to the 
periodic domestic agricultural legislation ("farm bills") developed and enacted 
by the Congress, in consultation with the Administration. </P>

and Regulations</SPAN></B></P>
<P>The 1990 "Farm Bill", the US Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act 
of 1990 (7 USE 3101) defined sustainable agriculture as "an integrated system of 
plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that 
will, over the long term, satisfy human food and fiber needs; enhance 
environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agriculture 
economy depends; make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and 
on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles 
and controls; sustain the economic viability of farm operation; and enhance the 
quality of life for farmers and members of rural communities, and society as a 
whole." The USDA policy on sustainable development (SM 9500-6), established in 
1996, states: "USDA will balance goals of improved production and profitability, 
stewardship of the natural resource base and ecological system, and enhancement 
of the vitality of rural communities." </P>
<P>The US government continuously reviews policy, research programmes, extension 
programmes and other activities related to food, fiber, and forestry production, 
marketing and consumption. The most recent national legislation on agricultural 
and rural development was the <B>1996 Farm Bill</B> (the Federal Agricultural 
and Improvement Act). This legislation extended the Conservation Reserve and 
Wetland Reserve Programmes until the year 2002. It also established the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Programme (EQIP) which combines functions of 
earlier conservation programmes, and improving community-based priority-setting 
for natural resources problems at the watershed level, including criteria for 
funding. Examples of critical resource issues which are being addressed include 
water quality, salinization, nutrient management, livestock management, water 
conservation, and soil erosion.</P>
<P>The US government began national efforts to slow farmland loss and protect 
important agricultural lands with the passage of the Farmland Protection Policy 
Act in 1981. Federal regulations to implement the law were finally adopted in 
1994. The 1996 Farm Bill created the Farmland Protection Programme, which 
provides matching federal funds for State and local farmland protection 
programmes. This programme compensates farmers for voluntarily limiting future 
development on their land through a "conservation easement." The programme 
enables landowners to sell development rights on their land to a government 
agency while retaining full ownership. A Farmland Information Center (FIC) was 
also established to provide information resources to federal, state, and local 
officials, conservation professionals, farmers and ranchers, agricultural 
organizations and concerned citizens. The FIC is available through the Internet 
at: <A 
href="http://www.farmlandinfo.org/"><B>http://www.farmlandinfo.org</B></A>; 
technical assistance staff are available by phoning: 413-586-4593.</P>
<P>The periodic re-authorization of US national agricultural legislation (the 
"Farm Bill") has provided opportunities to improve national land conservation 
and rehabilitation efforts. The 1996 Farm Bill simplified several existing 
conservation programmes and created new programmes to assist landowners in 
addressing high-priority national environmental protection goals.</P>

<P>In 1996, USDA further committed all USDA agencies toward integrating 
economic, environmental, and social sustainability into all policies and 
programmes, particularly through interagency collaboration, partnerships, and 
outreach. A Director of Sustainable Development was appointed to represent USDA 
in both domestic and international arenas on issues relating to sustainable 
development. </P>
<P>In early 1999, The US released a <B>National Action Plan on Food 
Security</B>: "<U>Solutions to Hunger</U>" which was a joint effort between a 
Federal Interagency Working Group and the non-governmental Food Security 
Advisory Committee of the Board for International Food and Agricultural 
Development. This plan outlines the means, through priority strategies and 
actions, by which the United States will address the World Food Summit's goals. 
These include a policy environment that supports economic and food security and 
food and water safety, trade and investment liberalization, and improved 
decision making, through inventory, research, education, and integration of 
environmental and sustainability concerns. The National Action Plan is available 
at: <A 
href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/summit/usactplan.pdf"><B>http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/summit/usactplan.pdf</B></A>.</P>
<P>The USDA Community Food Security Initiative was created to implement the 
domestic components of the US Food Security Action Plan. The Food Security 
Initiative is designed to help communities build their local food systems in 
order to decrease hunger, improve nutrition, and help families move from poverty 
to self-sufficiency. The Initiative is building links directly between USDA and 
non-profit groups, private businesses, and citizens, as well as with state, 
local, and tribal governments to help communities end hunger. </P><I>
<P>Integrated Pest Management in US Agriculture</I></P>
<P>The US Government's research and education on Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) includes research on pests, pesticide resistance, biological controls, 
cultural controls and sterile insect release programmes. IPM involves the 
exploration and utilization of biological cycles and genetic diversity of 
agricultural pests, host resistance, naturally occurring pathogens and 
parasites. It also includes the study and use of reduced toxicity pesticides. 
IPM involves training and education to foster a variety of pest control 
techniques in order to keep pesticide intervention to a minimum. </P>
<P>The President has established a goal of IPM adoption on 75% of US cropland. 
The USDA Economic Research Service , in a recent report [Green Technologies for 
a More Sustainable Agriculture, 1999] shows that this goal has been reached for 
pest scouting in fruit and vegetable crops, and projects the goal for full 
implementation will be reached in vegetable production between 2008-36, and in 
fruit acres by 2005.</P>

<P>In support of resource based rural development, farm legislation was 
established and supports local Resource Conservation and Development Councils 
throughout the nation. These Councils which consist of citizen volunteers, 
design, fund, and implement a wide range of demonstration and capacity building 
projects in their rural communities. Examples of recent projects include: timber 
bridge construction, dry fire hydrant installation, oyster bed seeding, local 
value-added food processing systems, no till seeders, solar powered and animal 
operated pumps for rotational grazing system demonstrations, etc.</P>
<P>The Sustainable Agriculture Task Force of the President's Council on 
Sustainable Development, with extensive input from the public and a wide range 
of interested individuals and groups, completed and released its 1996 Report, 
which included goals and recommendations for policy actions to be implemented by 
the public and private sectors. Recommendations addressed supporting 
environmentally sound and economically viable agricultural production, 
revitalizing rural farming communities, producing a safe and high-quality food 
supply, encouraging research on integrating productivity, profitability and 
environmental stewardship, and achieving international harmonization of 
intellectual property rights. </P>

<P>Under the 1996 Farm Bill, a new <B>Farmland Protection Programme</B> has been 
implemented, and works through existing State and county rural land preservation 
efforts to limit non-agricultural uses of land. A new <B>Wildlife Habitat 
Incentive Programme</B>, which funds wildlife habitat restoration, restored 1.7 
million ha to date. Through the <B>Wetlands Reserve Programme</B>, almost 
524,000 ha of wetlands and wetland buffer areas are being restored on farmland. 
These programmes administered through USDA complement State, local, 
non-governmental, and other Federal efforts. The 1996 Farm Bill also continued 
existing natural resource conservation efforts which require preservation of 
existing wetlands on agricultural land, and require the use of special 
conservation plans to control erosion on highly-erodible soils for landowners to 
continue receiving farm programme benefits.</P>
<P>To encourage the economic development of rural communities, the US Government 
has an alternative <B>Agricultural Research and Commercialization Programme</B>. 
This programme seeks to enhance farm income by developing and commercializing 
non-food, non-feed uses of traditional and non-traditional agricultural 
products. A revolving loan fund, established to encourage this work has granted 
loans for purposes as diverse as the establishment of standards and common 
terminology for biofuels, the manufacture of paper from straw, the manufacture 
of high quality furniture from low-quality and small diameter logs, the use of 
kenaf as a mat for seeding lawn grass and making newsprint and fiberboard, and 
the use of milkweed as a filler for pillows and comforters. </P>
<P>One example of the US Government's effort to establish land reclamation 
programmes for degraded land is the <B>Conservation Reserve Programme</B>. The 
purpose of the programme is to assist land owners in the restoration of grass or 
trees on highly erodible or fragile cropland, (including land with associated 
ground or surface water that may be vulnerable to contamination). Through 
ten-year contracts, approximately 89 million ha (36 million acres) have been 
removed from production and revegetated in this programme. The USDA also 
provides various natural disaster relief programmes to assist farms and ranches 
that have suffered losses.</P>
<P>The USDA <B>Agricultural Research Service (ARS)</B> conducts research on 
sustainable plant nutrition and increasing food production, availability, and 
safety. All aspects of agricultural research from germplasm conservation to 
human nutrition are addressed in 23 national programmes. Sustainability is an 
important element of all these national research programmes. All ARS national 
programmes [details can be found on the Internet at: 
<B>http://www.ars.usda.gov</B>] seek to enhance productivity while minimizing 
impacts on the environment. National programmes in the Natural Resources and 
Sustainable Agricultural Systems area in particular address topics such as water 
management and quality, soil quality, rangeland health, manure management, 
climate change, and integrated farming systems. The Integrated Farming Systems 
(IFS) National Programme is the focal point for research activities that take a 
holistic approach. IFS research takes into account the interacting components a 
producer must balance, how the farm or ranch as a whole ban best be managed, and 
how the farm functions within the larger landscape.</P>

<P>Agriculture in the United States (US) today is both diverse and complex, and 
its description requires more than a compilation of facts on farm numbers, farm 
sizes, and farm production. National averages often mask the variation and 
interactions that are key to understanding the roles of major participants in US 
agricultural production. Such an understanding is essential to assessing the 
sustainability and the economic health of the agricultural sector, and the 
effects of government programmes and Federal laws on farming systems and rural 
areas across the country.</P><I>
<P>Land Conservation and Rehabilitation</I></P>
<P>Of the existing total land area in the United States of 4.7 billion hectares 
(ha) [1.9 billion acres], about 1.5 billion ha [600 million acres] physical 
characteristics favorable to crop production: sufficient rainfall, adequate 
topsoil depth with good water-holding capacity, and gentle slopes. Results from 
the USDA National Resources Inventory indicate that on the nation's non-federal 
cropland, erosion decreased by 42 percent between 1982 and 1997. </P>
<P>About 1.6 billion ha (660,000 acres/year) of cropland and pastureland were 
converted to urban uses in the US during the period 1982 to 1992. Although the 
cropland base is fairly stable at 939 million ha (380 million acres) since 1992, 
more than half of the cropland converted to developed land between 1982 and 1992 
was considered prime agricultural land. Land converted to cultivated cropland 
between 1995 and 1997 was generally lower in quality (steeper and more erodible) 
than the existing cropland area. </P><I>
<P>Sustainability of Freshwater Resources for Agricultural Production and Rural 
Development</I></P>
<P>The United States is a water-rich country overall, but there is significant 
variation is water availability from one place to another and from one year to 
the next. Irrigation constitutes almost 85% of consumptive use, with the 
remainder going to domestic use (7%), industry (5%), and power generation (4%). 
Since the early 1970s, considerable progress has been made in improving the 
quality of US waters, but much remains to be done to achieve water quality goals 
stated in the US Clean Water Act.</P>
<P>In 1997, USDA released a report: <U>Water Quality and Agriculture: Status, 
Conditions, and Trends</U>. The report addresses soil quality, sediment, 
nitrogen, phosphorus, pesticides, salinity, agricultural resource management, 
water quality, and agricultural policies and programmes.</P>
<P>In 1998 the U.S. government released a <U>Clean Water Action Plan: Restoring 
and Protecting America's Waters</U>. A key element is a new cooperative approach 
to watershed protection in which state, tribal, federal, and local governments, 
and the public identify priority watersheds with critical water quality problems 
and then work together to focus resources and implement effective strategies to 
solve those problems. An interagency Animal Feeding Operation Strategy to 
combine clean water goals with animal and crop nutrition has been released and 
is undergoing extensive public review.</P>

<P>The USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) Programme 
administers a competitive grants programme that has advanced sustainable 
agriculture systems in the United States. The SARE programme works through four 
regional Councils to identify information needs and select projects in a 
competitive process. The SARE programme also supports Sustainable Agriculture 
Working Groups, and a Sustainable Agriculture Campaign. SARE has funded nearly 
1,400 projects to explore and apply economically-profitable, 
environmentally-sound and socially-supporting farming systems. The SARE website 
is: <B>http://www.sare.org</B>.</P>
<P>The USDA Small Farm ,Programme with a goal to improve the income levels and 
economic viability of small farm enterprises, convened a National Conference in 
1996 to discuss research, extension, marketing strategies, economic 
opportunities, social issues, small farm policy, and programme impacts, 
accountability, and delivery. Proceedings were published in 1997 and USDA is 
working to implement the recommendations in that report. The USDA Small Farms

<P>Diversifying Rural Employment</I></P>
<P>To help rural Americans build globally competitive businesses and 
cooperatives, the USDA administers a variety of business programmes including 
grants, commercial lending and revolving loan funds as well as technical 
assistance, which are usually leveraged with commercial, cooperative, or other 
private-sector lender resources. Guarantees or direct loans are available for 
businesses that create or maintain employment and improve the economic and 
environmental climate in rural communities. </P>
<P>These programmes are delivered by a nationwide field staff serving 50 States, 
the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Western Pacific Territories. In 
Fiscal Year 1998, a total of 983 loans and 435 grants totaling US$ 1.3 billion 
were disbursed. This resulted in over 70,000 jobs either being created or saved 
in rural America.</P>

<P>The US Government has many programmes that collect data, establish databases, 
and provide network access to these databases. Databases are developed and 
maintained for germplasm information, pests, pesticide and fertilizer use, 
production practices, soil types, forest types, insect infestations, and crop 
coverage/production. Economists analyze the data to compare input use and 
profitability of different production practices. Many of these databases can be 
accessed worldwide by research scientists, extension agents, farmers, and the 
general public.</P>
<P>The US Government is dedicated to making available all necessary knowledge 
and technology to farmers, extension agents and planners. The Sustainable 
Agriculture Network (SAN) is the outreach arm of the USDA Sustainable 
Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) programme. The Sustainable Agriculture 
Network disseminates information about sustainable agriculture through 
electronic and print publications. For example, in 1997 it published the Source 
Book of Sustainable Agriculture for Educators, Producers, and other Agricultural 
Professionals: A Guide to Books, Newsletters, Conference Proceedings, Bulletins, 
Videos and more. Other SAN books address cover crop use, weed management and 
organic agriculture. SAN publishes informational bulletins about sustainable 
agriculture, including dairy, crop diversification and on-farm research. It also 
sponsors a mail group on the Internet called sanet-mg, where 900 subscribers 
discuss sustainable agriculture philosophy and practices. SAN maintains most of 
its information on the World Wide Web, where more information about the SARE

USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), provides world leadership in 
developing and applying information technologies that ensure that agricultural 
knowledge and information are available to those who need it. AGRICOLA 
(AGRICultural OnLine Access), NAL's ever-growing bibliographic database of over 
3 million records, provides onsite and remote users with the information they 
need, quickly and easily. National and international customers seeking 
information are served through AgNIC, a virtual information center established 
in collaboration with several land-grant university libraries to provide a focal 
point for seamless Internet access to distributed agriculture-related 
information, subject area experts, and other resources. AgNIC includes AgDB, a 
database directory of quality agriculture-related databases, datasets, and 
information systems, [<B> <A

seeking specific information about alternative, organic, or sustainable 
agriculture are served by NAL's Alternative Farming Systems Information Center 
(AFSIC).</P>
<P>USDA maintains a number of databases available to all users through the 
National Agricultural Library. Extension agents in virtually every county of the 
United States provide information and technical assistance to farmers and 
citizens. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) (formerly the Soil 
Conservation Service) has natural resource planning specialists in virtually 
every county, to assist landowners with resource planning. Through the 
Sustainable Agriculture Network (SANET) funded by the SARE programme, 
information is being provided in many forms, including printed reports and 
databases that demonstrate research findings to farmers with computers and to 
information providers world wide. The Department of Agriculture operates the 
Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA) programme which 
transfers information about sustainable agriculture to farmers. The US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have formed a partnership with a 
number of groups and companies representing agricultural and non-agricultural 
pesticide users to promote environmental stewardship of pesticide use in the 
United States. </P>

<P><I>Rural Energy Transition </I></P>
<P>USDA, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Department of 
Energy (DOE) have supported numerous research, demonstration, and pilot projects 
on producing alternative energy from agriculture, including, for example, 
methane capture from livestock operations, production and use of biomass crops, 
and solar and wind power generation. By a recent (August 1999) Executive Order, 
federal efforts to develop 21<SUP>st</SUP> century bio-based industries that use 
trees, crops and agricultural and forestry wastes to make fuels, chemicals, and 
electricity will be further coordinated and accelerated. A goal of tripling U.S. 
use of bio-based products and bioenergy by 2010 was established by the Executive 
Memorandum. This could create $15 billion to $20 billion in new income for 
farmers and rural America, and reduce fossil fuel emissions by an amount up to 
100 million metric tons of carbon.</P><I>
<P>Conservation and Sustainable Use of Plant and Animal Genetic 
Resources</I></P>
<P>The National Plant Germplasm Advisory Committee has been in operation for 
over 20 years. The US Government maintains the world's most extensive germplasm 
storage network. The base collection is housed in the National Seed Storage 
Laboratory. Active genebanks are located in more than 20 locations around the 
country. Compared to plant germplasm initiatives, the conservation and 
sustainable utilization of animal genetic resources for sustainable agriculture 
is in its infancy. The US, however, has begun collecting a national inventory of 
available animal genetic resources. </P>
<P>The USDA National Plant Materials Programme selects and develops plant 
materials for commercial distribution. These plants, for use in land 
conservation, are increasingly selected from among native plant species.</P>

<P>The US Government participated in the exchange of scientific personnel for 
education, training and cooperative efforts related to sustainable agricultural 
practices in developing countries. It also provides scientific, technical and 
educational assistance addressing issues of agricultural sustainability. USAID 
has supported sustainable agriculture practices through the International 
Agriculture Research Centers (IARCs), which receive their funding through the 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR). The US is also 
one of CGIAR's leading contributors. The US has also worked at FAO to support 
greater diffusion and action on programs that promote sustainable agricultural 
practices. </P>

initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by the year 
2000. It is estimated that these efforts will save $260 billion in energy bills

initiatives are largely voluntary programmes designed to spur cost-effective 
actions without additional regulations and bureaucracy. One of these, The US 
Initiative in Joint Implementation, jointly chaired by the Department of Energy 
and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a voluntary pilot programme designed 
to contribute to international understanding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in different geographic regions through joint US and foreign partnerships. </P>
<P>In July 1996, the US announced interest in achieving a binding agreement to 
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The US government will attempt to reduce 
emissions through market-based solutions such as pollution trading permits and

estuaries, wetlands, floodplain, critical habitat for endangered species). State 
governments have broad responsibilities for regulating uses of land and natural 
resources (e.g., hunting and fishing) not subject to Federal reservation.&nbsp;

<P>In 1993, the White House Office of Environmental Policy established the 
<B>Interagency Ecosystem Management Task Force</B> to coordinate the 
implementation of a comprehensive<B> Ecosystem Management Initiative</B>. The 
Task force seeks to promote a consistent approach to environmental management by 
learning from large scale ecosystem-based management efforts, and strengthening 
the ongoing development of an ecosystem management approach for federal lands 
and federally managed programmes. This approach entails involving multiple 
agencies within larger ecological boundaries. It also relies on finding ways to 
increase voluntary participation of state, tribal, and local governments as well 
as nongovernmental organizations and the public. Through the Ecosystem 
Management Initiative, multi-agency Ecosystem Management Teams are being 
established to work with local and regional stakeholders in developing "New 
Initiatives Laboratories" as cooperative demonstrations of ecosystem management 
in areas where such management is not well developed, yet where significant 
opportunities for demonstrating integrated management exist. </P>

<P>State and local parks and reserves are important in biodiversity 
conservation. In states that lack large federal landholdings, NGOs, private 
institutions and individual landowners protect large numbers of tracts, maintain 
significant <I>ex situ </I>facilities such as arboreta and zoological parks and 
play an increasing role in conservation. </P>
<P>Cooperative efforts involving various levels of government and the private 
sector are underway to implement the biosphere reserve concept in several 
regions. For example, in the diverse forest ecosystem of the southeastern 
highlands, the Southern Appalachian Man and the Biosphere (SAMB) Programme is 
being implemented as a joint undertaking of the SAMB Cooperative and the SAMAB 
Foundation. The former organization includes representatives from Federal and 
state agencies, and the latter from private institutions, nongovernmental 
organizations, and local communities. Working together, these organizations 
enable ecosystem stakeholders to consult, share capabilities, and pool resources 
to address conservation and development problems in a biologically diverse and 
culturally distinctive area that includes territory of six states. The 
International Sonoran Desert Alliance is a public-private partnership, 
established in 1992 in an area of the western Sonoran desert that includes a 
cluster of biosphere reserves in northwestern Mexico and Arizona. The Alliance 
includes residents, business leaders, state and federal resource managers and 
conservationists from the United States and Mexico, and offers an 
ecosystem-based forum for local communities to develop shared goals and joint 
projects for community development and protection of the cultural and biological 
diversity of one of the largest intact arid ecosystems in the world. The Nature 
Conservancy (TNC), has pioneered development of methods and data systems to 
support biodiversity conservation. </P>

<P>Post-UNCED domestic policy has focused on promoting partnerships among 
Federal, state and private programmes concerned with biological diversity, 
coordinating government-wide research, data systems, and technology development, 
and demonstrating ecosystem-based management approaches, while concurrently 
establishing protected areas, maintaining <I>ex situ</I> repositories for 
genetic resources and improving public education. Federal systems of national 
parks, forests, grasslands, wildlife refuges, marine sanctuaries, wilderness 
areas, and other management categories and special designations play a major 
role in situ conservation of biodiversity. Federal programmes and facilities 
also play a major role in collection and <I>ex situ</I> preservation of crop 
germplasm and other genetic resources of potential or actual economic 
importance. </P>
<P>The State Department has coordinated development of the interagency <B>Coral 
Reef Initiative</B> to build domestic and international partnerships, provide 
coordination and integration of existing and new activities, and develop the 
technical and human resources needed to conserve, protect, and manage coral reef 
ecosystems in the United States and the world. The CRI was launched through an 
international workshop in early 1995. By 1996, plans called for implementation 
of an expanded Coral Reef Research Programme, a global monitoring programme, a 
comprehensive programme of research and conservation of reef ecosystems under US 
jurisdiction and an international programme of capacity-building focusing on 
partnerships for effective management of coral reef ecosystems, taking into 
account the full range of threats from local land-based pollution to the 
potential effects of global change. </P>

<P>Significant areas susceptible to desertification comprise approximately 37% 
of the United States. Numerous federal, state and local land use plans have been 
prepared for areas susceptible to desertification. These plans generally fall 
into three broad categories: functional or sector-specific plans, such as 
highway construction plans; resource specific plans, such as plans to manage 
fishery resources or plans to reduce soil erosion; and local comprehensive land 
use plans. The US has only begun to undertake planning on an ecosystem-wide 
basis. There are no national or regional plans or strategies to combat 
desertification. </P>
<P>The impact of improper farming, land use, natural causes and water 
withdrawals on desertification is modest. Grazing has a moderate impact; fuel 
wood collection is insignificant. Improper grazing practices in the 1800's and

<P>The US has a highly decentralized federal system of government and a mix of 
forest land ownership. About 60% of US forests (180 million ha) are privately 
owned by 11 million owners. The 50 states are individually responsible for 
guiding and regulating management of these private forests. The states also 
manage state-owned forests, and at the local level, hundreds of counties and 
many cities own and manage forest areas. About 35% of forest land (105 million 
ha) is federally owned and managed by several agencies of the federal 
government, including: the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service; the US 
Department of the Interior US Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, 
US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs; and, the US 
Department of Defense. In view of decentralized forest regulation and extensive 
private ownership, the actions of state and local governments and non-government 
parties, such as small non-industrial forest owners, industry, local communities 
and environmental advocates, have a profound effect on how forests are managed 
in the US and the progress made domestically towards forest conservation and 
sustainable management. In addition, US citizens are part of the natural 
resource public decision-making process at local, regional and national levels 
throughout the country.</P>

<P>There are numerous organized advocates in the US for forest conservation and 
use that have a profound effect on US forestry and forest policy. This is 
illustrated by forest legislation that has been revised or enacted in the last 
decade alone includes the Forest Stewardship Act of 1990, the Cooperative 
Forestry Assistance Act of 1990, American the Beautiful Act of 1990, National 
Indian Forest Resources and Management Act of 1990, the 1995 and 1998 Farm 
Bills, and regular reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Under 
the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Act of 1974 (RPA), the US Forest 
Service publishes an "Assessment of US Forests" every ten years, with five-year 
updates. The corresponding programme, also published every five years, provides 
broad guidance for more specific national forest plans, statewide resource plans 
and research plans.</P>
<P>In July 1998, the President signed into law the Tropical Forest Conservation 
Act (TFCA), which authorizes the reduction of official debt owed the US by 
countries with tropical forests in exchange for forest conservation measures. 
The law expands the 1992 Enterprise for the Americas Initiative which led to the 
signing of agreements with seven Latin American countries that were undertaking 
macroeconomic and structural adjustment reforms to cancel $875 million in their 
official debt, generating substantial local currency for child survival and 
environmental projects. Seven countries have requested debt buyback or 
debt-for-nature swaps under the TFCA; many more have expressed interest in debt 
reduction should funding become available. </P>
<P>There are a number of standards and certification schemes, such as the 
International Standards Organization and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), 
involved in a growing trend for wood products certification. This trend is 
reflected in the increasing number of lumber mills seeking and receiving "chain 
of custody" certificates, and a number of large corporate retailers such as Home 
Depot, the worlds third largest lumber retailer, selling certified wood 
products. To date, about 179 companies throughout the US carry FSC 
chain-of-custody certification and 52 US forest management companies are 
FSC-certified. </P>

<P>The Forest Service is incorporating the concept of sustainable forest 
management, and criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, into 
this mandated planning. This includes maintenance of biodiversity, forest 
productivity, forest health, soil and water protection and maintaining a viable 
forest economy, as well as the policies and institutions necessary to implement 
the desires of society regarding forests. </P>
<P>The best example of policy following UNCED Forest Principles is the ecosystem 
management approach to the stewardship of public forest lands. The President's 
office has established an interagency coordinating committee for ecosystem 
management.</P>
<P>By using this approach, concerted efforts have been made in the Pacific 
Northwest to resolve issues centered on forest protection and timber harvest, 
the preservation of old growth ecosystems, scenic values, and the livelihoods of 
local communities. In April 1994, following a process of participation with all 
stakeholders and the completion of an environmental impact statement, the 
President's Forest Plan was adopted for all federal lands in the Pacific 
Northwest region.</P>
<P>The President's Forest Plan has three components: An Aquatic Conservation 
Strategy aimed at restoring and maintaining the ecological health of the 
region's watersheds, a Terrestrial Conservation Strategy aimed at maintaining 
late successional and old growth species habitat and the biological diversity 
associated with such ecosystems, and an initiative to help local communities 
adjust to new forest ecosystem protection management. The Fish and Wildlife 
Service is involved in the implementation of conservation and management 
programmes for forest dwelling neotropical birds. The Fish and Wildlife Service 
has developed partnerships with dozens of federal and State agencies, private 
conservation organizations and local governments to restore and manage forest 
habitats for these migratory species. The Texas Gulf Coast Wood Lot Initiative 
(important to migrating birds crossing the Gulf of Mexico) and the 12 million 
hectare Tennessee Valley Project are examples.</P>

<P>Respect and recognition of traditional rights of indigenous people, including 
Native Americans, Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives, is an ongoing effort by 
the US. Since 1992 numerous actions have been taken by the Government, including 
issuance of Executive Orders regarding consultation and coordination with Indian 
governments and Indian sacred sites and of directives on 
government-to-government consultations with federally recognized tribal 
governments. </P>
<P>State Foresters are responsible for the establishment of State Stewardship 
Committees in every state, which include representation from a range of natural 
resource disciplines as well as the public and private sectors. Each state has 
also developed and is implementing state resource plans, which will ultimately 
bring millions of hectares of non-industrial private forest lands under 
stewardship management.</P>
<P>There are numerous organized advocates in the US for forest conservation and 
use that have a profound effect on US forestry and forest policy. For 
example:</P>
<P>The Nature Conservancy (TNC), an NGO dedicated to preservation of the 
nations biodiversity, has acquired over 3.64 million hectares of wildlife 
habitat and manages over 1,500 reserves. TNC is currently focusing on developing 
agreements with the business community and have come to an agreement with the 
timber company Westvaco to conduct a biodiversity inventory of its 562,000 
hectares of land.</P>
<P>In October 1994 the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA), which 
represents 95% of the industrial forest land in the US, approved a set of 
Sustainable Forestry Initiative Principles and Guidelines (SFI), which includes 
performance measures for reforestation and the protection of water quality, 
wildlife, visual quality, biological diversity and areas of special 
significance. In 1998 the programme was expanded to include public and 
non-industrial private lands. </P>
<P>The US-based International Wood Products Association (IWPA), which represents 
major timber exporting and importing companies, has established 
membership-approved voluntary "Codes of Conduct" for trade in wood products and 
forest management, similar to the SFI. </P>
<P>The National Woodland Owners Association, together with the Association of 
Consulting Foresters, has recently accepted sustainable forest management as a 
goal and the concept of certified wood products as a tool to accomplish that 
end. This is reflected in their "Green Tag Programme, which certifies wood 
products produced by small non-industrial wood producers.</P>
<P>The Conservation Fund is working with state foresters and recently acquired 
over 100,000 hectares of forest land in the states of New York, Vermont and New 
Hampshire. &nbsp;</P>

<P>Within the US Forest Service, the State and Private Division serves the 
nations non-federal forest owners with a number of focused programmes, 
including the Stewardship Incentives Programme (SIP), a companion to the Forest 
Stewardship Programme. The SIP, which began in 1992, provides cost-share 
assistance for private landowners to implement a broad range of practices 
recommended under their Stewardship Management plans, including wildlife and 
fish habitat improvement, soil and water improvement, forest recreation 
enhancement, riparian and wetlands protection and reforestation. Over 1.16 
hectares of private lands were in stewardship management by 1998. Plans to fund 
this programme from other sources than federal funds are now being created.</P>
<P>The US Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is involved in 
the implementation of conservation and management programmes for North American 
forest dwelling neotropical birds. FWS has developed partnerships with dozens of 
federal and state agencies, private conservation organizations and local 
governments to restore and manage forest habitats for these migratory species. 
The Texas Gulf Coast Wood Lot Initiative (important to migrating birds crossing 
the Gulf of Mexico) and the 12-million hectare Tennessee Valley Project are 
working examples.</P>
<P>The US Forest Service has a national programme to address urban forest 
issues. It is a cooperative community-based programme designed to bring an 
understanding of natural resources concepts and careers to city dwellers. The 
first Urban Tree House Programme, inaugurated in Atlanta, Georgia, serves as a 
working model for several other cities interested in their own Programme, such 
as Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, among 
others. </P><STRONG><SPAN lang=EN-GB

<P>On October 13, 1999 President Clinton announced plans to protect an 
additional 16,194,000 ha of federally owned forestlands from road building and 
commercial development. A year-long process soliciting public comments will 
determine the specific areas selected. This is considered one of the biggest 
land conservation efforts in Americas history.</P>
<P>In September 1999 the US Forest Service issued new draft planning regulations 
that will give greater emphasis to the sustainable management of National Forest 
Systems. The regulations provide direction for working towards the goal of 
sustainability and acknowledge the importance of Criteria and Indicators for 
sustainable forest management, emphasizing monitoring activities designed to 
develop a desired future condition. Under these new regulations, the US Forest 
Service will allocate $11.5 million to engage more actively in partnerships with 
states, NGOs and industry in pursuit of its goals. </P>
<P>In July 1998 the Chief of the US Forest Service initiated the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Forests, bringing together representatives of federal, state and 
local government agencies, non-government organizations and industry to discuss 
how best to implement the Montreal Process C&amp;I for both public and private 
forests. The Roundtable has drawn up a charter and plan of action, established 
working groups on communications/public outreach and technical issues. The 
communications working group has created a website and taken the Roundtable 
message to key domestic forestry and sustainability meetings. The technical 
working group is organizing workshops for early 2000 that will address each 
Criterion and its Indicators, assessing what has already been done on data 
collection and what still needs to be accomplished. </P>
<P>The United States is the fourth most forested country, with 8% or 300 million 
hectares (ha) of the world's forests, exceeded only by the Russian Federation, 
Brazil and Canada. These forests range from the dry chapparal "forests" of the 
Pacific southwest to the oak-hickory forest of the east and the old growth 
Douglas fir and Sitka spruce forests of the Pacific coast rainforest.</P><I>
<P>Forest Cover</I> The success of US conservation policies put in place in 
response to public concerns at the turn of the century left the US well 
positioned to implement UNCEDs Agenda 21. An extensive educational, management 
and policy infrastructure now exists to support scientific forest management. 
The US experienced a net growth in the area covered by forests since the 1920s. 
Today, 33 % (298 million ha) of the US is forested, constituting two-thirds of 
the forest at the time of European settlement. Substantial natural and 
artificial reforestation has taken place and now exceeds forest temporarily lost 
from harvesting. Populations of many forest wildlife species have substantially 
increased, as have recreational and other public uses of forest land.</P><I>
<P>Wood production</I>. The efficiency of wood utilization has greatly improved. 
The average volume of standing timber per acre has increased 32 % since World 
War II, and forest growth nationally currently exceeds harvest by 21 %. About 82 
% of total wood harvest occurs on private lands. Federal, State and local 
governments spend $6.4 billion annually on forest management, including $3.2 
billion by the US Forest Service, which manages 190 million acres of national 
forests and rangelands and employs 32,000 people. State forestry agencies assist 
non-industrial private forest land owners to manage their land in a sustainable 
manner, producing multiple resources. Government, universities and industry are 
all actively involved in research to produce faster and better growing forests. 
New and innovative ways are constantly being developed to use wood products more 
efficiently.</P><I>
<P>Forestry profession</I> The Forestry profession is changing in the US. Since 
1968 the number of foresters graduating with associate or bachelors degrees has 
dropped by half. This trend may not reflect a decline in interest in forestry 
but rather an expansion and diversification of natural resource management 
degrees related to forestry, such as conservation biology and ethnobotany. The 
last decades have seen a growing interest by students and employers in 
recruiting young professionals with broader resource skills to address ecosystem 
management. The Society of American Foresters, the US professional society for 
foresters, calculates that there are approximately 62,000 professional foresters 
working in the field and that over time this number will decline but the 
professional training of the average forester and the number of forestry related 
professionals will broaden.</P>

<P><I>Forest health</I> Forests in the US are considered productive and provide 
for most of the countrys needs. Although there are areas of local concern 
regarding forest loss, deforestation is not perceived as a national problem. 
However, current assessments of the health and conditions of US forests show 
that in some cases resource conditions are not satisfactory. For example, tree 
mortality as a result of exotic forest disease is so extensive that the 
composition of forest ecosystems across the US has changed. Acid-forming 
airborne chemicals are having observable impacts on tree health. Large forested 
landscapes have an unnatural distribution of trees of different ages because of 
previous harvesting practices. Although older age forests are important to the 
biodiversity of forest ecosystems, the growing number of aging and overstocked 
forest landscapes are becoming vulnerable to insects and disease. The national 
list of threatened and endangered species is increasing and some fish habitat 
populations are limited by problems of water quality and quantity.<SPAN

<P>The cooperative function of the US Forest Service and the USDA Cooperative 
State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES) is to educate, train 
and assist private landowners and the States in conservation and sustainable 
management of forest lands. The USDA CSREES Logger Education to Advance 
Professionalism Programme (LEAP) promotes silviculture and environmental 
education for loggers to better understand the logic and philosophy involved in 
sound forest management. </P>
<P>Federal forestry extension programmes are more than equally matched by state 
university and private funds. State forestry agencies receive federal funding to 
provide incentives and training to landowners through the Forest Stewardship 
Programme. NGO forest owners associations, such as the National Woodland Owners 
Association, Forest Landowners Association and the American Tree Farm Programme, 
provide both continuing education and professional forestry counsel. Wildlife, 
recreation and fish conservation NGOs such as the Izaak Walton League, Ducks 
Unlimited and the National Wildlife Federation are doing similar work.</P>
<P>The US Forest Service has initiated a national programme to establish a 
network of Urban Tree Houses. The Urban Tree House is a cooperative 
community-based programme designed to bring an understanding of natural resource 
concepts and careers to urban children. The first Urban Tree House, inaugurated 
in Atlanta, serves as a working model for several other US cities that are 
interested in operating their own Urban Tree House Programmes such as 
Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, among 
other locations. The US Extension Service's Logger Education to Advance 
Professionalism Programme (LEAP) promotes silviculture and environmental 
education for loggers so they better understand the logic and philosophy 
involved in sound forest management. Currently, the majority of timber 
harvesting operations on private lands are carried out without the assistance or 
guidance of a professional forester of any kind. It is estimated that as much as 
eighty percent of all harvesting operations are planned and executed by only the 
logger, who is often unaware of the impact logging activities have on soil or 
water quality. Another institutional improvement has been the use of electronic 
mail networks which is proving to be a very powerful communication tool for 
NGOs, government agencies and business.</P>

  <LI>In June 1999 the Office of the US Trade Representative and the White House 
  Council on Environmental Quality sponsored an initial study on the potential 
  economic and environmental effects of tariff liberalization in the forest 
  products sector. The study was released in October 1999. </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>The US Government cooperated with a consortium of environmental NGOs and 
  the Ford Motor Company in an initiative led by the World Wildlife Fund US to 
  prepare a comprehensive "Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions 
  of North America," including forests, which was published in May 1999. 
  <LI>In June1998 the US Forest Service committed to prepare a comprehensive 
  national assessment of the status and trends of US forest conditions and 
  management based on the Montreal Process criteria and indicators (C&amp;I) for 
  sustainable forest management. The report will be released in 2003 as part of 
  the mandated national assessments, released every five years, of all forest 
  lands and trends in the forest sector, which the US undertakes within the 
  framework of the Resources Planning Act of 1974. The resulting Presidential 
  report to Congress will be organized using the Montreal Process C&amp;I. Also 
  in July 1998 the US Forest Service officially institutionalized the Montreal 
  Process C&amp;I as the framework for all future forest inventories, 
  assessments, monitoring and performance accountability from the field level to 
  the national level for the 76 million hectares of national forests managed by 
  the Forest Service. Several of the 50 States have since agreed to take similar 
  steps for state and private forest lands. 
  <LI>The US Forest Service is in the process of integrating and expanding its 
  two existing national forest monitoring systems: the Forest Health Monitoring 
  programme (FHM), which includes a systematic assessment of numerous indicators 
  of environmental health, and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) 
  programme, which provides data on forest extent, type, growth and other timber 
  values. The Forest Service also has fully staffed the National Inventory and 
  Monitoring Institute chartered in 1996 to coordinate national and subnational 
  application of inventory systems, including the Montreal Process C&amp;I. 
  States in the Northeast, Northwest and Great Lakes regions are using the 
  Montreal Process C&amp;I to develop subnational C&amp;I to do assessments for 
  their regions. 
  <LI>The National Association of State Foresters (NASF) is re-evaluating the 
  data it provides federal agencies to determine how that data can be augmented 
  and organized to better contribute to national forest assessments. The NASF 
  has just completed a state-by-state nationwide survey on the status of 
  available data for each of the Montreal Process C&amp;I. 
  <LI>The US Forest Service, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US 
  Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management and the States have begun 
  an annual assessment of the health and vitality of the nations forests, which 
  will serve as an early warning system for the broad areas affected by insects 
  and diseases, atmospheric deposition, meteorological events, human activities 
  and climate change. The programme expanded from 14 states to 32 in 1999. 
  <LI>The US Forest Service, in partnership with 13 other federal agencies, is 
  leading the development of scientific protocols for implementing national and 
  regional scale ecological assessments. The protocols will be tested in the 
  Columbia River Basin, the Southern Appalachian Mountains and the Mid-Atlantic 
  states. The Southern Appalachian and Columbia assessments are complete; the 
  Mid-Atlantic assessment has been expanded to include the Delaware River Basin. 
  In 1999 a new assessment for the entire Southeastern US will begin, which will 
  include the southern Appalachians. This will augment the current forest 
  inventory system of over 100,000 plots that are sampled on an 11-year cycle. 
  <LI>In July 1998 the US Forest Service completed its submission to the Enquiry 
  for the UN-ECE/FAO Temperate and Boreal Forest Resources Assessment (TBFRA) 
  2000, providing data on general forest resources, biological diversity, 
  protection status, wood and carbon supply, forest condition and socio-economic 
  function of the forests. The Forest Service is now looking at strategies to 
  provide crosslinks among the Montreal, Helsinki and TBFRA process indicators. 
  Under the auspices of the North American Forestry Commission, the US, Canada 
  and Mexico have chartered a new study group on inventory and monitoring.

  <LI>In July 1998 the US Forest Service convened a North American workshop on 
  how to carry out the UNs Forest Resource Assessment (FRA 2000) remote sensing 
  survey in North America, which FAO will use as a model for other regions. 
  Agreed to assist Mexico to carry out its remote sensing survey. Through the 
  International Institute for Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, coordinated the 
  remote sensing assessment for the Caribbean region, including country capacity 
  building. 
  <LI>In 1998 and 1999 the US Forest Service provided consultants to FAO to 
  assist with the development of strategic and implementation plans and 
  organization for FRA 2000 and is now providing technical assistance for the 
  remote sensing component (project design, image acquisition and analysis) and 
  the assessment of non-wood goods and services. 
  <LI>The US Forest Service acquired the necessary satellite imagery and 
  completed the remote sensing component of FAO Global Forest Resources 
  Assessment 2000 (FRA 2000). 
  <LI>The US Forest Service has initiated work with the International Institute 
  for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) to develop forestry databases for Russia 
  and analytical assistance with the Russian "First Approximation Report" on 
  data availability for C&amp;I implementation. The Forest Service is also 
  providing technical advice for establishing or revamping national scale 
  inventories in the Baltics, Argentina, Mexico and Indonesia. 
  <LI>The US will host the 11<SUP>th</SUP> Meeting of the Montreal Process 
  Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable 
  Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests in November 1999 in Charleston, 
  South Carolina. The US is the current chair of the Working Group's Technical 
  Advisory Committee (TAC), which is tasked to develop concepts for the 
  application of C&amp;I. 
  <LI>In 1998 the US posted timely satellite data (images, graphs, maps) on the 
  World Wide Web (1-2 days after observation) on the fires in the Amazon, 
  Indonesia and Mexico to support government and stakeholder forest fire 
  management, prevention and suppression efforts; in June 1998 reprogrammed its 
  PPG-7 contribution to support Brazils fire monitoring and prevention 
  programme (PROARCO); in July launched an extensive training and extension 
  programme with $1 million spent on community training in the Amazon during the 
  fire season. 
  <LI>The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hosted 
  an "Intercomparison Workshop" in March 1999 to review the 1998 Brazilian 
  forest fire monitoring campaign, using the Geostationary Operational 
  Environmental Satellite (GOES), Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental 
  Satellite (POES) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP). 
  Brazilian scientists participated in the workshop to analyze lessons learned 
  during the 1998 fire campaign and improve preparations for the next fire 
  season. 
  <LI>Building on the 1998 fire season, US and Brazilian government agencies 
  have drawn up a well coordinated plan of fire management activities for 1999. 
  These activities, which include -- among others -- satellite fire detection, 
  airborne imagery and computerized fire forecasting models, are designed to 
  refine further Brazils fire management capabilities. 
  <LI>In June 1998 the US Department of State launched a new $3.3 million East 
  Asia and Pacific Environmental Initiative to help address the devastating 
  fires and related haze problems in the region and reduce the extent of future 
  fires. This included funding a study by CIFOR and ICRAF on the underlying 
  causes of the 1997-98 conflagration. 
  <LI>The US Government assisted Mexico with fire emergency planning and 
  preparation, including training sessions in November 1998. In March 1999 the 
  US co-sponsored a fire experts meeting on use and management of fire in 
  agro-pastoral and forestry programmes in Mexico. In 1998, the US established 
  an $8 million fire prevention and restoration fund with Mexico NGOs. 
  <LI>In July 1998 the US Department of State hosted the 1<SUP>st</SUP> 
  international conference of senior experts from 35 countries and international 
  organizations to help launch a Global Disaster Information Network (GDIN) to 
  reduce disaster losses by establishing a virtual network that facilitates 
  timely dissemination of accurate information for the prevention, mitigation 
  and response to natural disasters. In May 1999, the US and Mexico co-sponsored 
  the 2nd GDIN meeting in Mexico City to discuss specific goals and objectives 
  for the Network. Subsequent meetings are scheduled for April 2000 in Ankara, 
  Turkey and for 2001 in Canberra, Australia. 
  <LI>The G-8 has begun work on a US-proposed collaborative initiative as a tool 
  for forest assessment and management, including monitoring threats to forest 
  health such as fire. </LI></UL>

<P>Funding for forest management at the state and federal levels has not 
increased in the last few years, as of April 1997. With inflation, actual 
budgets have decreased. Federal, state and local annual spending on forest 
management is approximately $6.4 billion.</P>
<P>In 1998 the US Department of Energy and AF&amp;PA expanded their cooperative 
"Technology Vision and Research Agenda 2020" to include the US Forest Service. 
Agenda 2020 is designed to promote sustainable forestry practices across the US 
by identifying and funding high priority research projects aimed at increased 
efficiency, biotechnology and sustainable forestry. Thus far, Agenda 2020 has 
attracted $13 million in joint public-private financing, including eight new 
projects funded with US Government support. A fourth round of projects was 
proposed in March 1999.</P>
<P>In October 1998 the Chief of the US Forest Service allocated $2 million in 
grant funding under the "Natural Resources Agenda for the 21st Century," a major 
natural resource initiative that will use sustainable forest ecosystem 
management as its unifying theme, with special emphasis on restoring degraded 
watersheds and improving recreation services for visitors to national 
forests.</P>

<P>The United States also has major interests at the international level. With 
its vast forest resources, the US is today the world's largest producer, 
consumer and trader in wood products, accounting for 15% of world trade in 
forests products. The forest products sector, although small in comparison to 
the rest of the US economy, is significant on a global scale, as demonstrated by 
the fact that the US exports and imports of wood products total $150 billion 
yearly. In addition, the US provides substantial forest-related assistance to 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition through the US 
Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, as well 
as through contributions to international organizations and financial 
institutions, such as the World Bank, and various innovative debt reduction 
initiatives. Several of the largest multinational forest and paper companies are 
US-owned, and many US-based environmental organizations and academic 
institutions undertake forest field activities and projects abroad.</P>
<P>U.S. bilateral assistance, through USAID, USDA and other federal agencies 
includes more than 150 projects in 95 countries throughout the world. Of 
particular interest is the focus on assistance to Russia which possesses 20 
percent of the world's forests. The Peace Corp's environmental programmes have 
been expanded to include 900 volunteers working in 51 countries through all 
regions of the world. Nearly 50 percent of these volunteers are assigned to 
forestry related projects. As a member of the North American Forestry Commission 
(NAFC), institutional strengthening and capacity building for sustainable 
forestry has been a focus through training and technical exchanges. General 
projects include training and cooperating in fire suppression, cooperation to 
develop monitoring projects for migrating species, increasing the populations of 
endangered species, e.g. protection of monarch butterfly habitat, reintroducing 
the Mexican Grey Wolf, and improving neotropical bird habitat. Participatory 
management, important in the United States, has become the mechanism for 
including the perspectives and needs of all members of local communities. The 
International Intertribal Conference on Sustainable Forest Management, jointly 
sponsored by the US Forest Service and USAID, also promotes participation and 
sustainable forest management by indigenous people.</P>
<P>The US is active in a wide variety of intergovernmental agreements, 
organizations, initiatives and other fora that undertake forest related work and 
policy discussions. Key among them is the UN CSD Intergovernmental Forum on 
Forests (IFF). The US is an active member of the 12-country Montreal Process 
Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable 
Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests and hosted the 11th Meeting of the 
Working Group in November 1999 in Charleston, South Carolina. The US initiated 
the G-8 Action Programme on Forests, which world leaders launched at the Denver 
Summit in 1997 and endorsed a year later. A progress report on implementation of 
the G-8 Action Programme will be submitted to G-8 leaders at the Okinawa Summit 
in 2000.</P>
<P>The US Government is committed to the goal of forest conservation and 
sustainable management at home and abroad. International political commitments 
such as the Montreal Process on Criteria and Indicators, the G-8 Action 
Programme on Forests and the Proposals for Action agreed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF), as well as a number of national 
initiatives, provide an action-oriented framework for meeting this goal. </P>
<P>The US is actively pressing the G-8 and other industrialized countries to 
establish environmental guidelines for export credit agencies along the lines of 
the "Environmental Procedures and Guidelines" used by the Export-Import (EX-IM) 
Bank of the United States to evaluate applications for financial support for 
foreign projects sponsored by US business. Proposed forest sector projects, such 
as pulp and paper mills, are evaluated by EX-IM for ecological soundness and 
mitigation measures. Project sponsors are required to develop forest management 
plans that considers, among other things, impacts on water resources, 
endangered/threatened species, and local communities from construction and 
operation.</P>
<P>The US Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI), part of the US 
Governments Climate Change Action Plan, encourages US businesses and 
non-governmental organizations to use their resources and innovative 
technologies and practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote 
sustainable development worldwide. The USIJI, working with partners in the US 
and 14 other countries, supports projects dealing with, among others, carbon 
sequestration, reforestation, national park preservation, reduced impact logging 
and community silviculture. For example, US and Dutch power corporations and 
IWPA (International Wood Products Association), are working with the Sabah 
Foundation in Sabah, Malaysia on demonstration projects to improve forest 
management practices while contributing to carbon emission reductions.</P>
<P>USAID and the US Department of Commerce are working with AF&amp;PA under the 
auspices of AF&amp;PAs Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) to restore areas 
in Central America devastated by Hurricane Mitch in May 1999. This partnership 
will include a pilot programme on the Honduran Island of Guanaja designed to 
establish the infrastructure needed for long-term sustainable forest management. 
</P>
<P>In 1998 the US Government, through USAID and contributions to the 
International Tropical Timber Organization, supported initial projects on low 
impact logging in tropical forests of Brazil and Indonesia, which are being 
implemented by the Tropical Forest Foundation, an NGO comprised of 
representatives from industry, environmental groups, professional forestry 
associations, and academia.</P>
<P>In June 1998 the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), working 
in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, increased the number of 
ports of entry available to accept timber species listed on CITES appendices to 
facilitate and respond to the Appendix III listings of Swietenia Macrophylla (a 
commercially traded tropical timber species) undertaken by Bolivia, Brazil and 
other major range states.</P>
<P>In 1998 USAID, through its Proarca Capas programme, provided financial 
support to undertake studies in Central America and Mexico on the distribution 
and status of mahogany (Swietenia Macrophylla) harvesting activities, illegal 
logging and illegal trade.</P>
<P>The US considers all the above as contributory to US implementation of the 
IPF Proposals for Action, both at home and abroad. The US Government has also 
initiated a process of consultation with stakeholders on implementing the IPF 
Proposals for Action. As part of this process, the US is exploring linkages 
between the IPF Proposals for Action and the Montreal Process C&amp;I. A report 
on the status of US implementation, including next steps, will be developed.

<P>In the United States, 32 federal executive agencies in 10 cabinet 
departments, including the Executive Office of the President, are actively 
involved in the policies and programmes to manage and protect the quality and 
supply of the Nation's freshwater resources - 25 separate water programmes in 
all. Each agency approaches the task from a particular perspective based on its 
legislative mandates.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In Congress, on the legislative side of the federal system, 12 standing 
committees in the House and Senate have direct jurisdiction over various 
components of federal water resource policy, and this excludes the 
responsibilities of the Appropriation Committees, the Budget Committees, the 
Ways and Means and the Finance Committees, or the House Government Reform and 
Oversight, and the Senate Government Affairs Committees which all have ongoing 
interests in water. In essence, the complex federal executive responsibilities 
for water resources reflect the multiple congressional legislative 
responsibilities, which in turn mirror the multiple competing interests for 
water in the U.S. </P>
<P>The major federal water resource agencies are the following : 
<UL>
  <LI>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements a wide range of 
  programmes to protect the nation's freshwater resources. The core of these is 
  a series of regulatory programmes to protect the quality of the nation's 
  waters, under the Clean Water Act (CWA). These programmes are augmented by 
  nonregulatory efforts targeted to minimize nonpoint sources of pollution and 
  improve aquatic ecosystem vitality. EPA also administers the <B>Safe Drinking 
  Water Programme</B> and several other regulatory programmes that are relevant 
  to freshwater issues including programmes dealing with toxic substances and 
  waste disposal. EPA works with the states to implement these water programmes. 
  In the vast majority of states, the state has been delegated lead 
  implementation and enforcement responsibility for these water programmes by 
  EPA. EPA also capitalizes state revolving funds for clean water and drinking 
  water infrastructure. The EPA increasingly provides assistance and works 
  cooperatively on water issues in the international arena to share experiences 
  and solutions. 
  <LI>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the nation's largest public 
  water resources development and management agency. The Corps also has an 
  important regulatory function in that most work in waterways and wetlands must 
  have prior approval of the Corps. 
  <LI>The Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) water resources 
  programmes focus on upstream watershed protection and management and on 
  improving water management on farms, in rural areas, and in small communities. 

  <LI>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has the responsibility of 
  providing water in the 17 western states, much of which is arid land.Today 
  with a major network of water supply and power generation infrastructure in 
  place and settlement of the West realized, Reclamation has shifted emphasis to 
  integrated water resources management which promotes more efficient use of 
  water, water marketing and water transfers strategies, protection of 
  environmental values, and efficient operation and maintenance of the existing 
  water infrastructure in the West. 
  <LI>The U.S. Geological Survey (Survey) has the principal responsibility 
  within the federal government to provide the hydrologic information needed to 
  achieve the best use and management of the nation's water resources. 
  <LI>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the primary 
  institution within the U.S. government responsible for providing financial 
  support and technical assistance to further global sustainable economic 
  development. USAID's programmes are carried out primarily through 
  country-level missions -- located throughout the developing world -- in which 
  local projects are often implemented in cooperation with centrally organized, 
  worldwide projects such as the Water and Sanitation for Health (WASH) Project 
  of USAID's Research and Development Bureau. 
  <LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a wholly owned federal government 
  corporation established in 1933 by Congress. TVA built and manages a system of 
  dams in the Tennessee River basin to provide flood control, electric power, 
  navigation, and recreation. 
  <LI>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), working with the other 
  federal agencies, states, tribes, and private organizations, conserves, 
  protects, and enhances fish and wildlife and their habitats for the continuing 
  benefit of the American people. Relating to water quality, the Service takes 
  the Clean Water Act goal of water quality that is both "fishable and 
  swimmable" seriously and strives to enhance conservation and protect habitat 
  for freshwater species. </LI></UL>
<P>Water resources authorities and responsibilities are shared by many different 
government agencies who coordinate informally among themselves. The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) in the Executive Office of the President serves as 
the principal federal agency concerned with water resource coordination, with 
preparation of the President's Budget annually, and with the review and 
coordination of all water programmes, as well as with all regulations and 
Executive Orders. </P>
<P>Disaster preparedness is the joint responsibility of local, state, and 
federal government. Officials at the local level have primary responsibility. At 
the federal level, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), working in 
conjunction with other federal agencies that have specific preparedness 
authorities, has the responsibility to coordinate the overall federal 
preparedness effort. The Corps of Engineers has principal responsibility for 
preparedness for floods. Other agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, have 
similar but small flood preparedness assistance programmes. </P>
<P>For droughts, no single agency has responsibility for coordinating the 
federal effort, although FEMA has been tasked to do so during several recent 
droughts. Numerous agencies have authorities that may be applied under certain 
specific conditions. </P>

and Regulations</SPAN></B> </P>
<P>There are more than 200 sets of federal rules, regulations, and laws which 
provide the legal framework for freshwater. The competing interests for water 
affects all economic, social and environmental activities today. </P>
<P>&nbsp;In fact, most decisions relating to surface water uses are made at the 
state level in the United States according to a variety of common law and state 
statutory schemes that differ greatly from state to state. State law on surface 
water can be grouped generally into three doctrines of water law: riparian, 
prior appropriation, and hybrid systems. Groundwater decisions and disputes in 
the United States are also largely handled at the state level, again generally 
according to common law and state law. Often state surface and groundwater 
statutes are managed independently of each other and thus may not link surface 
and groundwater resources activities. In addition, a number of states have 
entered into compacts (specific legal agreements between states) to allocate and 
manage water. Examples include the Colorado River Compact in the West and 
Connecticut River Compact in the East. </P>
<P>The legal and regulatory framework for water management includes the 
following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Water Pollution. The principal law governing pollution of the nation's 
  waterways is the Federal <B>Water Pollution Control Act </B>, or <B>Clean 
  Water Act </B>. Although enacted in 1948, it was amended in 1972, 1977, 1981 
  and in 1987. The Clean Water Act's objectives are the restoration and 
  maintenance of the "chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the 
  Nation's waters." 
  <LI>Drinking Water Quality. The major law which controls the quality of 
  drinking water in the United States is the <B>Safe Drinking Water Act 
  (SDWA)</B>. It requires EPA to set standards for contaminants in drinking 
  water in addition to providing regulations and guidance on treatment 
  technologies, monitoring of drinking water quality, reporting of results, 
  protection of drinking water sources, control of underground injection, 
  protection of aquifers, and compliance and enforcement actions. Along with 
  issuing standards to control quality, EPA provides technical guidance and some 
  financial resources to assist state, tribal and territorial drinking water 
  programmes to deliver safe water to their customers. The 1996 amendments to 
  SDWA strengthened the Act's public health protection by broadening its scope 
  of action and level of public involvement. The amendments also provided new 
  tools to address changing demands and increased scientific and programmatic 
  complexities. </LI></UL>
<P>Although state law generally controls the use of water and the states are 
pre-eminent in determining water rights, the federal government has a 
significant role to play in water allocation because of its financial support of 
major water development projects, its ownership of vast federal lands, and the 
primacy of the federal government in matters concerning navigation and 
international treaty obligations. Much of the federal law on water allocation is 
derived from the recognized right of the federal government to regulate uses of 
water that would interfere with navigation. </P>
<P>The Safe Drinking Water Act does not require water providers to have disaster 
preparedness plans. Fortunately, however, most states do require these, 
specifying communications plans, coordination efforts, provisions of alternative 
supplies, spare parts, and so forth. EPA and the Corps of Engineers are 
frequently brought in to advise state. </P>
<P>The Clean Water Act does not require waste water treatment providers to have 
disaster preparedness plans. However, treatment plants constructed under Title 
II (Construction Grants Programmess) were required to design facilities so that 
treatment would be maintained up to the 100 year flood level. The treatment 
plant owners are also required to maintain disaster insurance as part of the 
grant conditions and many plants have developed contingency plans in the event 
of a disaster. Under certain conditions Title VI (State Resolving Loan Fund) the 
Clean Water Act, may be used by the states to provide funds to help local 
officials reconstruct facilities damaged by natural disasters. </P>

<P><U>Pricing policy:</U> </P>
<P>There is no single pricing policy for water in the United States. In most 
cases water for municipal and industrial (M&amp;I) purposes is provided by local 
entities and pricing is established by that entity. The fact that Americans 
excpect to receive water of the highest quality, at the lowest price, and in 
unlimited quantity - everywhere and at all time should affect pricing, but that 
is so often not the case. Generally, it is federal and state water subsidies 
that change this economic equation. Thus, improper pricing of water, rather than 
inadequacy of supply, is most often the reason the United States experience 
water shortages. </P>
<P>In recent years at the federal level, there are some standard economic and 
pricing policies which are generally adhered to, as follows: 
<UL>
  <LI>Agricultural use: Costs are recouped for the capital federal costs 
  relating to that share of the project's costs allocated to irrigation. 
  Nationally, variable irrigation water costs for ground water and off-farm 
  surface are about equivalent, averaging about $14 per hectare. 
  <LI>Municipal and industrial use: Costs are recouped for the capital federal 
  costs relating to the share of project's costs allocated to municipal and 
  industrial use, again through long-term contracts although interest is 
  generally charged for M&amp;I water 
  <LI>Household use: Full costs are generally borne by the user when the water 
  is privately developed using groundwater resources.The rates themselves are 
  set by individual water providers, typically under the overall regulatory 
  authority of individual state Public Utility Commissions (PUC), which 
  generally ensure rates that are "just and reasonable." </LI></UL>
<P>Traditional federal water agencies have slowly been transforming their focus 
from project construction to systems management. On a related manner, during its 
consideration of setting drinking water standards, EPA does consider the costs 
of treatment as one important input to setting standards which protect public 
health. </P>
<P>For disasters stemming from oil spills or releases of hazardous substances 
into freshwater, the United States has promulgated a <B>National Contingency 
Plan </B>(40 CFR Part 300) that maps out the responsibilities and response 
authorities of various federal agencies including EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard 
to such disasters. </P><STRONG><SPAN lang=EN-GB

</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P>Broadly stated, federal water development policy has been successful in 
economic and social terms during the past 200 years. By the mid-1980's the 
federal government had spent $400 billion for capital investments addressing 
water resource development, developed over 40,000 kilometers of inland 
waterways, built 83,000 reservoirs and dams, installed over 88,000 mega-watts of 
hydroelectric capacity. More than 52,000 public water utilities supplied 86 
billion liters of freshwater each day to domestic users, more than 23 million 
hectares of land were irrigated, more than 15,000 municipal sewage treatment 
plants were in operation, over 60,000 water pollution control permits 
(end-of-pipe) had been issued to industry and other point sources of pollution 
around the country, and the frequency of flooding on several thousand streams 
had been curbed. </P>
<P>End-of-pipe water pollution has been greatly decreased as a result of federal 
control and financing during the last 25 years, although it remains a serious 
problem in many areas. However, non-point source water pollution from 
agriculture, suburban development, and urban runoff has grown rapidly in recent 
years and is not regulated at the federal level. While the United States 
struggles to provide so much water to so many at such a low cost, nearly 40 
percent of the rivers and lakes remain polluted to varying degrees; groundwater 
in many areas is subsiding; many of the fish and wildlife are endangered; 
developers and private citizens continue to build homes and businesses in the 
path of devastating floods; new water supplies are limited; sewage systems are 
expensive, and public funds are becoming increasingly scare for new water 
project development and for ongoing management of existing freshwater resources. 
Cleaning up the past water resource problems is expensive and will continue into 
the foreseeable future in the United States. </P>
<P>The good news is that as a nation, the United States is using less water 
today. Total water withdrawals for offstream use were 10 percent less during 
1995 than during 1980. This is a significant decline considering that the 
population increased 16 percent during the same period. The decline signals that 
freshwater resources are managed more effectively, that water use does respond 
to economic, environmental, and regulatory factors, and that the public has an 
awareness about water and conservation issues. </P>
<P>While significant progress has been made, much remains to be done to 
sustainably manage the national freshwater resources. As a matter of fact, more 
than 60 percent of the 87 million hectares of inland wetlands in the country 
have been converted to other uses, nearly 50 percent of the country's 2.4 
million kilometers of streams and an unknown percentage of the nation's 
groundwater are polluted to a significant degree, and the nation continues to 
experience ever-increasing flood damage losses, particularly during the last 
several decades. A significant number of freshwater plants and animals are now 
threatened or endangered and "dead zones" are just now being discovered along 
the coastlines. </P>
<P>During the twentieth century, seven different types of arrangements have been 
tried in the U.S. for jointly planning and managing water in its large federal 
system and varied hydrologic conditions. The early twentieth century was 
dominated by two approaches: inter-state compacts (which are similar to treaties 
among sovereign entities) and adversarial court cases. As population in the U.S. 
shifted, as Native American tribal demands grew, and as new uses (such as in 
stream flow and environmental quality) appeared, allocations under compacts 
proved too inflexible to be effective. In the 1980's, the U.S. moved away from 
this approach toward the market norm. Attempts were made to use more realistic 
pricing which was closer to marginal costs for water through a variety of market 
mechanism. </P>
<P>Today as a result of severe flooding losses (in the billions of dollars 
annually for the last several years), increased loss of biodiversity (protection 
of threatened and endangered species), and the multiple needs for more water, 
interest is emerging in additional water resources coordination. </P>
<P>Pollution prevention is becoming an increasingly important goal of agencies, 
because certain increasing forms of pollution are too costly and difficult to 
clean up after the fact. While the Clean Water Act controls pollution from 
pipes, there is no federal regulation of polluted run-off or groundwater 
contamination. Nutrient runoff from farmland along the Mississippi River and its 
tributaries has caused a large area dead zone of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, 
severely damaging the fishing industry. Groundwater/drinking water contamination 
by pesticides and herbicides in the agricultural regions is a growing problem. 
Farmers are being encouraged to plant buffer strips along stream banks to 
control erosion and run-off, and they are being encouraged to minimize chemical 
use and switch to chemicals that have a shorter life. </P>
<P>The design capacity of all the publicly owned waste water treatment 
facilities in the United States in 1996 was 160 thousand cubic meters per day. 
The average flow treated per day in 1996 was 122 thousand cubic meters. Based on 
U.S. Geological Survey information in the United States, about 3-5 percent of 
all the waste water flows are recycled. Under the Clean Water Act all discharges 
to surface waters of the U.S. must be treated to the level of secondary 
treatment. In 1996 about 72 percent of the U.S. population received publicly 
owned central collection and waste water treatment. The waste water from more 
than 90 percent of the population receiving collection was treated to at least 
secondary treatment level. </P>

<P>Decision-making is becoming more difficult today in federal and state water 
agencies with increased law suits, downsizing, fewer dollars to spend, 
micro-management by legislative bodies, and increasing demands coming from all 
directions - water users, municipal interests, agricultural interests, 
development interests, environmentalist, and the public. In summary, the United 
States has made great progress in managing its freshwater resources during the 
last 200 years, yet the country faces many very significant challenges in water 
as it moves into the 21st Century. </P>
<P>Today as a result of severe flooding losses (in the billions of dollars 
annually for the last several years), increased loss of biodiversity (protection 
of threatened and endangered species), and the multiple needs for more water, 
interest is emerging in additional water resources coordination. Examples such 
as the Everglades in southern Florida, the Bay-Delta in central California, and 
Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania along the mid-Atlantic 
coast, serve as model approaches to coordinated, sustainable, integrated 
management of water and related land resources, and ecosystems in the United 
States. </P>

<P>Approximately 1,100 sources of water-related information are presently

information system falls short of effectively distributing the water resources 
information that it has, although there are exceptions. This is a continuing 
shortcoming, a result of ineffective programmes coordination under the diverse 
federal water resource mandates. </P>
<P>At present, the U.S. Geological Survey manages three principal federal data 
bases: water quality at fixed monitoring stations, reconnaissance during storms 
and floods, and cause and effect studies on specific reaches of streams and 
rivers. In addition, USGS is the repository for streamflow and groundwater data 
and has the ability to access a variety of water-related data bases from other 
sources. Water use data are collected, compiled, and reported at 5-year 
intervals by the U.S. Geological Survey. </P>
<P>The Environmental Protection Agency has a water information data storage and 
retrieval system which contains water quality and quantity data for more than 
750,000 sites around the nation. The EPA system is called STORET. For drinking 
water, data on compliance with drinking water regulations are collected by state 
agencies and aggregated by EPA in a system denoted as the <B>Safe Drinking Water 
Information System </B>(SDWIS). Financial, administrative and managerial data on 
public systems are collected every few years by EPA's Community Water System 
Survey. Infrastructure needs are also surveyed periodically. EPA has also 
created an Internet site at: www.epa.gov/surf that allows anyone to obtain 
information about any watershed in the United States. EPA's Office of Water is 
located on the Internet at: www.epa.gov/water. Efforts are under way to link the 
vast water data bases so that water information can be used for decision making 
at all levels of government. </P>

<P>The Clean Water Act is considered to be a technology-based statute. In 
addition to the BAT national standards, states are required to implement control 
strategies for so-called "toxic hot spots" -- waters expected to remain polluted 
by toxic chemicals even after industrial dischargers have installed the best 
available cleanup technologies required under the law. States are required to 
develop water quality-based standards for all bodies of water within a state. A 
<B>National Pollution Discharge Elimination System </B>(NPDEs) permit may 
include limits based on these water quality standards when a more stringent 
limitation is needed to protect local water quality than is included in the 
technology-based standards. Certain responsibilities are delegated to the 
states, and this Act, like other environmental laws, embodies a philosophy of 
federal-state partnership in which the federal government conducts research and 
sets the national standards for pollution abatement while many states carry out 
day-to-day activities of implementation and enforcement. Here again, states 
perform many of these tasks while the federal government retains and exercises a 
role in both implementation and enforcement. As of the end of 1997, 41 states 
had delegated authority for the NPDES programme. </P>

</P>
<P>The U.S. federal capital investment in water resources has steadily decreased 
during the past 20 years. Most of the spending on non-capital expenditures goes 
to maintaining an aging water infrastructure. Most of the budgets of the 
traditional infrastructure agencies are now going to operations and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>Title II of the CWA established a grant programme for the construction of 
wastewater treatment works. The 1987 Amendments replaced this programme with the 
<B>Clean Water State Revolving Fund </B>(SRF) programme. Under this programme, 
the federal government provides grants to the states to capitalize these 
revolving loan funds, with a 20 percent matching fund requirement from the 
states. The SRF provides low-interest loans to municipalities to construct and 
upgrade wastewater treatment works. The federal government has provided $68 
billion from 1972 through 1998 for these two programmes. The Clean Water Act 
also regulates discharges into wetlands, both freshwater and coastal. </P>
<P>The percentage of costs recovered for drinking water varies by size of the 
system. In 1995, while only about 60 percent of the very smallest systems 
recovered their costs, the number of profitable systems rose in the larger size 
categories (serving over 50,000 customers per system) that serve the vast 
majority of U.S. citizens. Revenues for approximately 84 percent of publicly 
owned and 94 percent of privately owned systems were sufficient to meet or 
exceed expenses. Financial security for the larger systems has improved over the 
last 20 years, in contrast to the rather static picture for the smaller systems. 
</P>
<P>Under provisions of the Clean Water Act, federal funding contributed about 
one-half to three-quarters of the investment cost of local waste water treatment 
facilities of those communities receiving grant assistance during the period 
from 1972 to 1998. During this period federal funds provided nearly $68 billion 
in federal assistance for the construction of local waste water treatment 
systems; and state and local governments contributed more than $20 billion. A 
portion of these federal funds helped poorer communities provide basic sewage 
treatment. Since 1990, EPA's State Revolving Fund has provided low interest 
loans for the construction of waste water facilities. </P>
<P>In the United States there is a wide variety of private sector involvement in 
water supply services. In 1995, approximately 34.3 million people in the U.S. 
received drinking water from privately owned systems, as compared to more than 
six times that figure being supplied from publicly owned systems. Privately 
owned water systems in the U.S. represent a major financial component of the 
utility business, with over $14 billion in annual revenues in 1995. Private 
financing contributions to projects is now also growing </P>
<P>According to EPA's 1995 Community Water System Survey, the $20 billion U.S. 
drinking water industry continues to make large investments for water quality 
improvements (averaging 19 %), repairs or replacement (averaging 31 %), and 
system expansion (averaging 50 %). The average "large system" serving over 
100,00 people has invested nearly $54 million in these areas since 1987. EPA and 
the water industry are concerned, however, over the costs needed to maintain and 
improve drinking water services to the public. EPA estimated infrastructure 
needs of $138.4 billion over the next 20 years (in constant 1995 dollars), 
comprising needs of $77.2 billion (56 percent) for transmission and distribution 
systems, $36.2 billion (26 percent) for treatment, $12.1 billion (9 percent) for 
peak storage facilities, $11 billion (8 percent) for source rehabilitation and 
development, and $1.9 billion (1 percent) for all other needs. </P>
<P>Over the next twenty years it is expected that the percentage of the U. S. 
population receiving central waste water treatment will increase from 72 percent 
(1996) to about 88 percent (2016). The cost needed over the this period to reach 
this level of treatment is $120 billion in 1996 dollars. This is broken down as 
follows: $44 billion for treatment; $10 billion for sewer repairs and 
rehabilitation; $21 billion for new sewers; and $45 billion to correct combined 
sewer overflows. </P>
<P>Today the United States uses in excess of 1.8 million liters of freshwater 
per capita per year. This amount of water is currently made available at a low 
price averaging 5 cents per 1000 liters, and most of the water goes to 
agriculture. Costs to the typical U.S. household for drinking water are higher 
due to expenses for treatment and distribution, yet they are still affordable 
and represent only about one percent of median household income. </P>

Water Commission (IBWC) under the <B>U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty of 1944 </B>. In 
addition, EPA is undertaking additional actions on the Mexican Border 
Infrastructure under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The IJC 
acts as a quasi-judicial body to consider applications for approval to build and 
operate certain works in boundary water and in rivers that flow across the 
boundary. The IJC also, at the request of the parties, examines and provides 
non-binding recommendations on specific transboundary issues of mutual concern. 
In addition the IJC has critical duties under the <B>Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement </B>. This has been a highly successful effort to combat toxic 
contamination, promote an ecosystem approach to stewardship of the resource, and 
press for remedial action. </P>
<P>On the southern border, under the U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty of 1944, the two 
countries have established an International Boundary and Water Commission to 
address bilateral boundary and water problems. The IBWC divides the use of these 
international waters, benefiting peoples in both countries economically and 
socially. The IBWC has constructed and operates water conservation and flood 
control projects, and it constructs and maintains boundary markers on the land 
boundary and at international bridges. As a result of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, Congress provided $450 million to EPA to be used in support of 
drinking water and sewage infrastructure projects on both sides of the 
U.S.-Mexican border. </P>

<P>Land and growth management in the United States is largely addressed at the 
local and state levels, driven by a wide-range of issues and concerns. Many of 
these concerns in recent years are associated with the concept of "sprawl" and 
pit expansion of suburban and peri-urban development against protection of open 
space areas, agricultural activities, and aesthetic values. Local and state 
policies to respond to these concerns are diverse.</P>
<P>Many federal activities, policies and programmes affect rates and patterns of 
growth and the ability of local and state governments to address them. 
Periodically, the question arises as to whether the federal government should 
take steps to influence growth patterns and support local and state efforts to 
respond to growth management concerns, especially with respect to sprawl.</P>

<P>Recently, the Clinton Administration has attempted to address the issue 
through a nationwide "Livability Agenda" that promotes, among other things, the 
concept of "smart growth". The aim of the agenda is to help communities across 
America grow in ways that ensure a high quality of life and strong, sustainable 
growth. Under the agenda, the Administration is proposing new investments to 
provide communities with ways to preserve green space, ease traffic congestion, 
and pursue regional smart growth strategies.</P>
<P>The United States Government, pursuant to the 1996 Farm Bill and earlier 
legislation, maintains a "Conservation Reserve Programme" which enables private 
farm producers to bid to retire highly erodible or environmentally sensitive 
cropland, usually for 10 years. Participants receive rental or cost sharing 
payments and technical assistance for this programme through the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture. As of late 1998, the Conservation Reserve Programme contained 
approximately 30.5 million acres. </P>

<P>THE LIVABILITY AGENDA: A NEW U.S. INITIATIVE TO CONSERVE LAND RESOURCES 
</I></P>
<P>Over the past few years, the Clinton Administration has attempted to address 
land degradation concerns related to either to urban areas under a nascent 
"brownfields" programme, as well as "green communities " programmes and "smart 
growth" concepts related to both urban and "sprawl" concerns. In January 1999, 
in an effort to coalesce and build upon these early notions of promoting land 
rehabilitation and conservation efforts, the Clinton Administration announced 
initiatives that address the related land management issues of resource 
protection, sprawl and growth management. A "Livability Agenda" and "Lands 
Legacy Initiative" were unveiled as a means to help states and local communities 
address burgeoning land management challenges. The "Livability Agenda" would: 
<UL><U>
  <LI>provide federal tax credits</U> in lieu of interest for state or local 
  bonds (totaling $9.5 billion over 5 years) to buy park land, preserve farmland 
  and wetlands, and clean up abandoned industrial sites (brownfields); <U>
  <LI>increase a portion of federal transportation grants</U> for projects other 
  than road building (including $6.1 billion for mass transit , $1.6 billion to 
  improve air quality by easing traffic congestion, and $50 million for a pilot 
  projects on regional transportation planning programmes) ; and, <U>
  <LI>provide matching funds to assist in regional planning </U>and to assist 
  communities in developing land-use plans, to encourage community participation 
  in planning for education, and to fund the sharing of certain regional data 
  ($150 million). </LI></UL>
<P>The "Lands Legacy Initiative", among other things, would: 
<UL><U>
  <LI>increase federal land acquisition funding</U> (to total $413 million in 
  FY2000) using the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and designate 5 
  million acres of wilderness at specified locations, including in the Mojave 
  Desert, northern New England and the Everglades; <U>
  <LI>provide grants to state and localities</U> to acquire land and plan for 
  open space ($150 million in FY2000); <U>
  <LI>expand funding for other resource protection efforts </U>including the 
  Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, the Forest Legacy Programme, 
  Urban and Community Forestry Programme grants and the Farmland Protection 
  Programme ($220 million in FY2000). <U>
  <LI>Fund "smart growth" partnerships</U> using programmes at the Department of 
  the Interior and the USDA to support acquisition of land and easements in 
  rural areas. </LI></UL>
<P>The Congress is not expected to adopt the proposal submitted by the Clinton 
Administration. Nevertheless, the Administration believes that the growth 
management proposals that it has put forward respond to increasing public 
interest in "sprawl" and other land policy challenges. According to a recent 
Brookings Institution report, such issues, often characterized as a "quality of 
life issues" were addressed in 240 referenda in 31 states last year, and 72 
percent of these were reportedly passed in the November 1998 election.</P>

<P>As of 1996, only 10 states had statewide growth management plans with land 
management components. Another two had growth management plans limited to 
coastal areas alone. One state, Maryland, received considerable publicity when 
it adopted a "smart growth" strategy under legislation adopted in 1997. Under 
this legislation, state road and sewer project spending to assist development is 
to be concentrated both to revitalize approved urban areas and to curb sprawl by 
minimizing spending in other areas of the state. In addition, more than $70 
million is to be used by 2002 to purchase development rights on land with high 
environmental value in the state. The State of California, with the California 
Coastal Conservancy and Coastal Commission and the State of New York with its 
Hudson River Valley Greenway Act are also touted as examples of states trying to 
address land management challenges in a sustainable manner. The State of 
Colorado also had an initiative to allocate funds from the state lottery for 
land acquisition, easements, and other conservation measures. </P>
<P>There are also numerous initiatives at local levels throughout the United 
States that have has land management and growth as key issues. Included among 
these were the Sustainable City Plan for Berkeley, California, the Sustainable 
Cambridge (Massachusetts) coalition, Sustainable Chattanooga (Tennessee), 
Sustainable Seattle, and many others. The National Association of Counties and 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors cooperate in maintaining a "Joint Center for 
Sustainable Communities" that seeks, among other things, to encourage more 
communities to become sustainable through responsible land use design, 
brownfields redevelopment, appropriate transportation, "true cost" accounting, 
and other smart growth initiatives. </P>

<P><I>NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION ON AMERICAS PRIVATE LANDS</I></P>
<P>Conservation of soil and water resources has been a public policy issue in 
the United States for over 60 years. U.S. agricultural exports expanded rapidly 
through the 1970s to record levels, and U.S. producers responded by bringing 
additional land into production. Three problems ensued. One was high levels of 
soil erosion, the second was overproduction, and the third was providing water 
to agriculture in sufficient quantity and quality to enhance production. Federal 
programmes before 1985 allowed U.S. farmers to receive payments for acres not 
planted, referred to as annual set asides, but did not include any multi-year 
efforts that could provide more sustained benefits for conservation 
purposes.</P>
<P>In 1985, Congress enacted a farm act that created the "Conservation Reserve 
Programme" (CRP) to be managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The 
aim of the CRP was to reduce excessive erosion, stabilize farm prices, and slow 
excess production. Almost 34 million acres were enrolled in the programme by 
private producers from 1986 to 1990, under an enrollment cap of 38 million 
acres. During this time, the USDA continued to adjust the programmes formula 
for accepting bids from producers who wanted to join the programme by placing a 
growing emphasis on environmental benefits. After passage of the 1990 Farm Act, 
USDA started to compare bids using an evolving formula called the "Environmental 
Benefits Index" (EBI).</P>
<P>In 1996, the Congress passed the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform 
Act of 1996  more commonly referred to as the 1996 Farm Act. Under this law, 
provisions were made to either reauthorize or introduce new programmes. The CPR 
and Wetlands Reserve programmes were among those programmes reauthorized and 
readjusted, while new programmes included the Environmental Quality Incentives 
Programme (EQIP). The EQIP programmes aims are to provide $200 million per year 
to be split evenly between crop and livestock producers in addressing a range of 
conservation problems. While the EQIP programme was to be managed by the USDAs 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the CRP was to be once again 
administered by the USDAs Farm Service Agency (FSA).</P>
<P>As noted above, private farm producers are allowed to bid to retire highly 
erodible or environmentally sensitive cropland, usually for 10 years (or longer 
under limited circumstances). Participants receive rental or cost sharing 
payments and technical assistance for this programme through the FSA. As of late 
1998, the Conservation Reserve Programme contained approximately 30.5 million 
acres.</P>
<P>The CRP also has two other important ways to enroll land. One allows 
continuous sign-up for individuals who wish to enroll portions of their fields 
with particularly high environmental values. The second way is a state-initiated 
enhancement programme under which higher rents are paid to attract eligible 
land. In 1997, the State of Maryland became the first state approved for this 
programme. Maryland will contribute financial resources in an attempt to enroll 
100,000 acres of stream buffers, restored wetlands, and highly erodible lands 
near streams in the Chesapeake Bay drainage. (The Chesapeake Bay is the largest 
east U.S. coast estuary and is subject to harmful nutrient overloading brought 
about, in part, from agricultural run-off.)</P>
<P>Under the revised CRP, there is a total maximum enrollment cap of 36.4 
million acres and no one single county in any given state may exceed a 
participation rate of 25 percent. Numerous plains state counties are currently 
at capped enrollment.</P>

<P><I>LAND UNDER FEDERAL JURISDICTION</I></P>
<P>While the overwhelming majority of Americans reside in urban and suburban 
areas, the United States remains primarily an agricultural land. Nearly 71 
percent of land in the United States is in private hands or under state and 
local authorities. The remaining 29 percent of the land (657 million acres) is 
in federal hands and is administered primarily by four federal agencies: the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS) and the Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the 
Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The majority of these 
federal lands (92 percent) are in 12 western states, including Alaska. 
Altogether, the following four agencies manage over 95 percent of federal land 
in the United States and the Clinton Administration has sought to ensure that 
all manage lands in a sustainable manner involving public participation and 
stakeholders at local levels. And, of equal importance, are managed in 
accordance with a range of U.S. environmental laws, including the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). 
<UL><U>
  <LI>BLM</U>: The Bureau of Land Management administers 264 million acres, or 
  40 percent of all federal lands, as well as approximately 300 million 
  additional acres of subsurface mineral estate. The BLM manages these public 
  lands for sustained yields of multiple uses  livestock grazing, outdoor 
  recreation, timber production, water supply, wildlife and fish habitats, and 
  wilderness. Its mission statement calls on the BLM: "To sustain the health, 
  diversity and productivity of the Nations public lands for the use and 
  enjoyment of present and future generations." Federal environmental laws 
  affecting the BLM, such as NEPA, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
  (FLPMA), and the ESA, require that the BLM involve the public and consider the 
  needs of local communities when taking land management decisions. <U>
  <LI>FS</U>: The Forest Service manages a 192 million acre National Forest 
  System (NFS), consisting of 155 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and 
  112 other areas. Most NFS lands are concentrated in the western United States 
  and Alaska, but the FS manages more than half of all federal lands in the 
  eastern United States. NFS lands are generally administered for sustained 
  yields of multiple uses. The NS decides on permitted levels and locations of 
  the uses in land and resource management plans that are prepared by 
  interdisciplinary teams under the provisions of a wide-range of laws, 
  including NEPA and the ESA. The FS has committed to goal of ensuring the 
  sustainable management of the forests it manages wherever they are found in 
  the United States. <U>
  <LI>FWS</U>: The U.S. FWS manages 93 million acres in 512 national wildlife 
  refuges, including 198 waterfowl production areas, 50 wildlife coordination 
  areas, and 114 other sites in a "National Wildlife Refuge System" (NWS). The 
  FWS mission is to work "with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, 
  wildlife and plants and their habitat for the continuing benefit of the 
  American people." While the President or the Congress can create new NWS 
  units, most are established by the FWS under general land acquisition 
  authorities, especially the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The National Wildlife 
  Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, and earlier related laws, direct the 
  FWS to administer the System primarily to conserve and enhance fish and 
  wildlife and their habitats. Only uses compatible with these general purposes 
  are permitted. <U>
  <LI>NPS</U>: The National Park Service manages 77 million acres in the 378 
  units of the National Park System. There are many diverse categories of units, 
  with 20 different designations. The three largest units are the: (1) National 
  Parks (e.g., Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks); (2) National Preserves; 
  and, (3) National Monuments. The NPS also administers other units, including 
  some 19 National Recreation Areas. Some hunting, fishing, livestock grazing 
  and mineral extraction is allowed on certain NPS lands, but in some areas 
  these activities are expressly prohibited. Wherever such activities are 
  allowed, they must be compatible with the primary purpose for which the area 
  was set aside. </LI></UL>
<P>The NPS, FWS and BLM also are involved in managing three special management 
systems on the lands that they administer that have been created to protect 
particular features or characteristics. These include: the National Wilderness 
Preservation System (104 million acres); the National Trails System (20 trails 
totaling nearly 40,000 miles); and, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System 
(155 rivers totaling over 10,800 miles).</P>
<P>There are also sometimes transfers of land between the agencies. For example, 
roughly 3 million acres of land were transferred from the BLM to the NPS due to 
the enactment of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994, an act designed 
to help better conserve environmentally sensitive desert areas in 
California.</P>
<P>Several other U.S. agencies are involved in administering approximately 4 
percent of U.S. federal land. These include the Department of the Defense (DOD), 
the Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Bureaus of 
Reclamation and Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior (DOI) and 
others. DOD has both pollution prevention and conservation programmes 
established for lands that it manages and DOD installations are required to 
produce Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans and Integrated Cultural 
Resource Management Plans for the lands that they manage. DOD also maintains two 
funding programmes, a sustainable forest management programme for DOD lands and 
a small-grants programme for streamside restoration. DOE, together with all 
other US federal agencies must follow NEPA requirements pertaining to 
environmental impact assessments related to land use decisions. The Bureau of 
Reclamations mission is to "manage develop, and protect water and related 
resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of 
the American people. In addition to managing reservoirs in western United 
States, the Bureau of reclamation also manages over 300 recreation areas for 
public benefit.</P>
<P>DOIs Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has jurisdiction over more than 56 
million acres, of which more than 45 million acres are under tribal trust and 
about 10 million acres are individually owned. DOI is legally obligated to 
ensure that American Indian and Alaska Native resources and lands are properly 
managed, protected and conserved. DOI bureaus provide an array of services to 
American Indians. For example, in addition to BIAs activities, the BLM provides 
survey and mineral management programmes for tribes, DOIs Office of Surface 
Mining provides tribal grants for reclamation of abandoned mines and restoration 
of water quality affected by acid mine drainage. The Bureau of Reclamation 
provides financial and technical assistance to the tribes in the planning, 
design, construction, and operation of water resource needs on reservations. FWS 
partners with tribes in restoring and improving fishery resources, training 
conservation law enforcement officers from Native American tribes, and technical 
assistance for tribal resource conservation and management plans. DOIs U.S. 
Geological Service conducts research on water and mineral resources of 
environmental, economic or subsistence importance to Indians. NPS provides 
technical assistance to tribes on preservation of their endangered heritage and 
sacred places.</P>

<P>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), through its Urban and 
Economic Development Division, is coordinating the "Smart Growth Network", a 
coalition of private sector, public sector and NGO partners "seeking to create 
smart growth in neighborhoods, communities and regions across the United 
States." The partnership programme will conduct several projects to encourage 
more environmentally responsible land use, regional growth and development. 
USEPA is also involved in helping direct a "Brownfields National Partnership 
Partnership Action Agenda". This Agenda calls for the selection of 10 showcase 
communities across the nation to demonstrate that through cooperation, federal, 
state and local and private efforts can be concentrated around brownfields to 
produce environmental cleanup, stimulate economic development, and revitalize 
communities. The Agenda encompasses more than 100 commitments from more than 25 
organizations, including more than 15 U.S. agencies. These commitments represent 
a $300 million investment in brownfields communities by the Federal 
government.</P>
<P>USEPA also sponsors a green community programme, including a "Green 
Communities" assistance kit that takes users through a five-step process towards 
achieving "Green Community" status. A Green Community is one that provides open 
space, complies with environmental regulations, reduces consumption of natural 
resources and practices pollution prevention, actively involves all citizens and 
incorporates local values in decision-making and encourages all elements of 
civil society to work together with government to promote a healthy environment, 
a strong economy and a high quality of life. </P>
<P>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) also uses some of the 
core programmes that it funds to support livability and regional development 
initiatives, including "smart growth"and brownfields projects, at the levels of 
neighborhood, city, region and state. HUDs strategy is to lead in three 
dimensions: (1) identifying and working to promote livability and effective 
regional action; (2) adding new activities and policies that promote 
sustainable, equitable; and (3) building knowledge and constituencies so that 
local choices are both informed and responsive to all stakeholders.</P>

<P>With the support of HUD, the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, and other agencies 
together with the American Planning Association (APA) has launched a "Growing 
Smart" initiative. The initiative will be pursued in three phases. The first 
phase focuses on intergovernmental relationships and works to help design 
statutes that enhance regional planning and cooperation. The second phase 
develops model legislation dealing with local planning. A third phase will 
provide model legislation for creating the implementation tools communities need 
to manage change. As part of Growing Smart, the APA has prepared summaries of 
planning statutes of all 50 States, as well as the first of a series of working 
papers, entitled Modernizing State Planning Statutes, that addresses various 
aspects of local, state, and regional planning. More information on APAs 
Growing Smart efforts are available at: <A

<P>The US supports the Clearinghouse Concept in the <B>Global Plan of Action for 
the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities</B>. 
Adoption of a UNGA resolution would facilitate coordination among the UN 
agencies and international organizations. The ratification and implementation of 
IMO treaties also requires international cooperation. The United States fully 
supports the <B>Agreement for the Implementation of the Provision of the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</B> of 10 December 1982 relating to the 
<B>Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory 
Fish Stocks</B>, as well as the 1993 <B>Agreement to promote Compliance with 
International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the 
High Seas</B>. The US also fully supports the<B> Code of Conduct of Responsible 
Fishing</B> which impacts the conservation and management of marine fisheries 
within the US EEZ. </P>
<P>The Government recently helped launch a process to establish a multinational 
initiative for an International Research Institute (IRI) and network dedicated 
to world-class scientific research and education on forecasting on year-to-year 
climate variability. The US took the lead on developing the clearinghouse 
activity called for in the Global Programme of Action (GPA) on land-based 
activities and hosted the conference in 1995 which developed and adopted the 
GPA. The US plays a significant role in the IOC, IPCC, World Weather Watch, 
Earth Watch, and International Mussel Watch. The US notes the importance of 
para. 17.118 of Agenda 21 that calls for the UNGA to provide for regular 
consideration within the UN system on general marine and coastal issues, 
including environment and development items. The US Government participates in 
the Global Ocean Observing System. </P>
<P>USAID's Water and Coastal Resources Programme addresses the vital and 
strategic interests in promoting the sustainable development of freshwater, 
coastal, and marine resources. USAID is playing a leadership role in providing 
direction and impetus to international efforts to address the needs for 
integrated coastal and freshwater resources management, preservation of aquatic 
biodiversity and reduction of pollution from land-based activities. As part of 
its strategy, USAID is actively supporting the <B>International Coral Reef 
Initiative</B> (ICRI), which stems in part from a US initiative. In addition 
USAID actively supports the sustainable management of mangrove and other coastal 
ecosystems. </P>
<P>The U.S. hosted a UNEP organized conference on landbased sources of marine 
pollution in Washington in November 1995 that resulted in a Global Plan of 
Action to deal with this serious problem. The U.S. spearheaded international 
efforts in 1993/94 to call for a ban on radioactive waste dumping at sea. </P>
<P>The <B>UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</B> was signed but has not yet 
been ratified by the US. The Convention continues to serve as a comprehensive 
framework with respect to the uses of the oceans. It creates the structure for 
the governance and protection of all marine areas, including the air space above 
and the seabed and sub-soil below. The US signed the accompanying Agreement 
Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention on July 29, 1994, 
and intends to apply the Agreement provisionally pending ratification. </P>

<P>In response to growing public awareness and concern over environmental 
threats to human health posed by toxic chemicals and substances, the US Congress 
has established over the past 25 years a number of agencies to address different 
aspects of environmental health issues. The network of federal agencies, 
moreover, involves numerous constituent and participating groups. At the 
national level, the federal agencies - including USEPA, the Department of 
Labor's Occupational and Health Administration and seven different agencies 
within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), USDA, and the 
Department of Transportation -- play a large role in defining and pursuing 
environmental health goals pertaining to toxic chemicals and substances through 
research, administration and service programmes, as well as via regulation and 
enforcement activities. These agencies also provide valuable assistance to state 
and local environmental departments and health agencies. State and local 
agencies must address many of the same environmental health issues as the 
federal government. The scope and responsibilities of state agencies are

and Regulations</SPAN></B> </P>
<P>In 1996, the<B> Food Quality Protection Act </B>(FQPA) was adopted, amending 
FIFRA. The new law establishes stronger health-based safety standards for 
pesticide residues in all foods. It uses a "reasonable certainty of no harm" as 
a general safety standard. The single, health-based standard eliminates 
long-standing problems posed by multiple standards for pesticides in raw and 
processed foods. It requires USEPA to consider all non-occupational sources of 
exposure, including drinking water, and exposure to other pesticides with a 
common mechanism of toxicity when setting standards. </P>
<P>The foundation of the chemicals control programmes in the United States is 
based on the <B>Toxic Substance Control Act </B>(TSCA) and <B>Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act </B>(FIFRA). Non-pesticide chemical 
uses are covered by TSCA, which requires pre-manufacture notification and 
testing in some cases. FIFRA requires the registration, based on the review of 
testing data, of the domestic use of any pesticide. A related statute, the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) establishes tolerance levels for 
pesticides residues on foods, including imported foods. The <B>Consumer Product 
Safety Act</B> (CPSA) and the <B>Federal Hazardous Substances Act </B>(FHSA) 
address consumer exposure to hazardous chemicals and products, including those 
manufactured abroad. <B>Occupational Safety and Health Act</B> and the <B>Mine 
Safety and Health Act</B> address occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>The most significant innovations in chemical management in the past 10 years 
have been the result of the <B>Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know 
Act </B>(EPCRA) and the <B>Pollution Prevention Act</B>. EPCRA set up networks 
of local and state-level committees with the mission to develop plans to 
prevent, prepare for and respond to chemical accidents. EPCRA also established 
the toxics release inventory (TRI), which is a publicly available national 
database of routine annual emissions of over 300 toxic chemicals to air, water, 
land and off-site disposal. Early in 1993, the President ordered previously 
exempted federal facilities, including military installations, to report TRI 
emissions as well as stockpiles of chemicals stored on-site. EPCRA, complemented 
by related voluntary programmes, has, in many instances, resulted in greater 
reductions in environmental risk than more traditional command-and-control 
approaches. A significant change in the FHSA since UNCED has been the inclusion 
of guidelines for evaluating chronic hazards from the exposure to carcinogenic, 
neurotoxic and reproductive/developmental toxic substances. These guidelines 
facilitate better interagency and international coordination of policies 
regarding exposure to such substances. The Pollution Prevention Act established 
a bold national objective that "Pollution should be prevented or reduced at the 
source whenever feasible." The USEPA Administrator has made this ethic a central 
consideration of all EPA programmes. </P>

responsibility for municipal solid waste management. Invariably, based on the 
strong democratic system of government in the US, various stakeholders are 
included in the decision-making structure at the State and local levels. Solid 
waste management is typically provided or regulated by local governments with 
funding from general tax revenues. The federal government, through the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), establishes performance standards for 
State and local efforts to ensure protection of human health and the environment 
and also cooperates with these communities in a number of programmes to improve 
solid waste management and prevent pollution. One example of technology 
cooperation deals with underground storage tanks.&nbsp; </P>

<P>The US still records the largest per capita generation of municipal solid 
waste among OECD countries. Municipal solid waste is expected to decline 
slightly on a per capita basis by 2000 mostly as a result of source reduction 
efforts. The pursuit of the RCRA goal of promoting waste reduction, reuse and 
recycling is succeeding in gradually reducing quantities of municipal waste 
being incinerated and landfilled: the proportion of waste recovered tripled 
between 1970 and 1993 and now stands at about 22 percent. Despite the fact that 
38 States have enacted more than 140 recycling laws, with some having also 
established tax incentive programmes for recycling, overall US recycling rates 
are lower than those seen in other OECD countries. For example, nationwide about 
34 percent of paper and 22 percent of glass were recycled in 1993 as compared to 
other OECD countries who have reached 40 percent and more in their paper and 
glass recycling efforts. The RCRA goal of cradle-to-grave management of waste is 
broadly being met. In spite of some slow efforts in some localities, most 
municipal waste is now disposed of in lined landfills, incinerated, or 
composted. Unsound disposal operations have been shut down. The share of 
incineration is not expected to grow and is likely to remain at about 16 
percent, while landfilling is projected to decrease by about 10 percent between 
1993 and 2000. </P>

Construction Grants Programme provided a total of nearly $60 billion in federal 
assistance for the construction of municipal sewage treatment works, while 
states and local governments contributed over $20 billion. This has resulted in

<P>The United States cooperates with its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, in 
addressing solid waste and sewage-related issues as they may arise. USAID 
strives to alleviate problems arising from poor sanitation and contaminated 
drinking water by assisting local governments in developing countries and in 
countries with economies in transition to improve and expand urban environmental 
services and related infrastructure, primarily water supply, sanitation and 
drainage, and solid waste management. USAID programmes are aimed at increasing 
the volume of wastewater collected and treated from poor neighborhoods; 
introducing municipal and industrial performance standards for disposal of 
waste; and increasing capacity for compliance and enforcement of pollution 
standards. USAID activities have resulted in improved access to waste collection 
services and supported private-public cooperation in solid waste management. 
These activities have resulted in better sanitation, particularly for the urban 
poor. The United States adheres to the OECD Council Decision governing trade in 
recyclable waste with other OECD countries. </P>

<P>The US is strongly committed to public participation in environmental 
decision-making, and believes that federal programmes dealing with hazardous 
waste issues are run better when there is significant public input into the 
process. There are both federal programmes as well as many state and local 
government programmes that address hazardous waste issues. Federal agencies have 
established programmes to encourage development of new hazardous waste cleanup 
technologies. Major groups play a key role in policy, scientific and 
technological issues involved with hazardous waste issues at federal, state and 
local levels. The predominant major groups involved include environmental NGOs, 
business and industry, and those from the scientific and technological field.

<P>RCRA is a nation-wide programme to protect human health and the environment 
from the risks of improper management of hazardous and solid waste, and it 
provides a "cradle-to-grave" system of regulations for hazardous waste to 
promote the cleanup of sites that have been contaminated with hazardous 
substances while ensuring that, to the extent possible, the polluter pays 
principle is adhered to. This programme is, to a large extent, administered by 
State governments with federal oversight.&nbsp; </P>

<P>USEPA has also focused RCRA initiatives since UNCED on environmental justice 
through siting, permitting, public involvement, corrective action, 
disproportionate impacts and Native American tribal issues. For example, the 
USEPA expanded public involvement and improving its own ability to include 
environmental justice in public health considerations and to assure that 
priority-setting methods adequately address environmental justice concerns. Much 
of the USEPA action related to environmental justice is done in line with the 
Executive Order issued by President Clinton in February 1994 on <B>Federal

the present generation's accountability for current radioactive waste 
inventories. The US Department of Energy is continuing its efforts to develop a 
waste-management system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste 
from both civilian and government facilities. The system will consist of a 
geologic repository, a monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility, and a 
transportation system to support storage and retrieval. The NRC will license 
civilian facilities. A conceptual design has been completed for the MRS, which 
will handle and store fuel until it is permanently disposed of in a 
repository.&nbsp; </P>
