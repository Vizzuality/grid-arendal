        <H3>An Essential Dimension of Genome Research</H3>
        <P>The Human Genome Project is rich with promise, but also fraught with 
        social implications. We expect to learn the underlying causes of 
        thousands of genetic diseases, including sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs 
        disease, Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and 
        many forms of cancer -- and thus to predict the likelihood of their 
        occurrence in any individual. Likewise, genetic information might be 
        used to predict sensitivities to various industrial or environmental 
        agents. The dangers of misuse and the potential threats to personal 
        privacy are not to be taken lightly. </P>
        <P>In recognition of these important issues, both the DOE and the 
        National Institutes of Health devote a portion of their resources to 
        studies of the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of human 
        genome research. Perhaps the most critical of social issues are the 
        questions of privacy and fair use of genetic information. Most observers 
        agree that personal knowledge of genetic susceptibility can be expected 
        to serve us well, opening the door to more accurate diagnoses, 
        preventive intervention, intensified screening, lifestyle changes, and 
        early and effective treatment. But such knowledge has another side, too: 
        the risk of anxiety, unwelcome changes in personal relationships, and 
        the danger of stigmatization. Consider, for example, the impact of 
        information that is likely to be incomplete and indeterminate (say, an 
        indication of a 25 percent increase in the risk of cancer). And further, 
        if handled carelessly, genetic information could threaten us with 
        discrimination by potential employers and insurers. Other issues are 
        perhaps less immediate than these personal concerns, but they are no 
        less challenging. How, for example, are the "products" of the Human 
        Genome Project to be patented and commercialized? How are the judicial, 
        medical, and educational communities -- not to mention the public at 
        large -- to be effectively educated about genetic research and its 
        implications? </P>
        <P>To confront all these issues, the NIH-DOE Joint Working Group on 
        Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Human Genome Research was 
        created in 1990 to coordinate ELSI policy and research between the two 
        agencies. One focus of DOE activity has been to foster educational 
        programs aimed both at private citizens and at policy-makers and 
        educators. Fruits of these efforts include radio and television 
        documentaries, high school curricula and other educational material, and 
        science museum displays. In addition, the DOE has concentrated on issues 
        associated with privacy and the confidentiality of genetic information, 
        on workplace and commercialization issues (especially screening for 
        susceptibilities to environmental or workplace agents), and on the 
        implications of research findings regarding the interactions among 
        multiple genes and environmental influences. </P>
        <P>Whereas the issues raised by modern genome research are among the 
        most challenging we face, they are not unprecedented. Issues of privacy, 
        knotty questions of how knowledge is to be commercialized, problems of 
        dealing with probabilistic risks, and the imperatives of education have 
        all been confronted before. As usual, defensible perspectives and 
        reasonable arguments, even precious rights, exist on opposing sides of 
        every issue. It is a balance that must be sought. Accordingly, further 
        study is needed, as well as continuing efforts to promote public 
        awareness and understanding, as we strive to define policies for the 
        intelligent use of the profound knowledge we seek about ourselves. </P>

<P>The Age of Discovery was the age of da Gama, Columbus, and Magellan, an era 
when European civilization reached out to the Far East and thus filled many of 
the voids in its map of the world. But in a larger sense, we have never ceased 
from our exploration and discovery. Science has been unstinting over the ages in 
its efforts to complete our intellectual picture of the universe. In this 
century, our explorations have extended from the subatomic to the cosmic, as we 
have mapped the heavens to their farthest reaches and charted the properties of 
the most fleeting elementary particles. Nor have we neglected to look inward, 
seeking, as it were, to define the topography of the human body. Beginning with 
the first modern anatomical studies in the sixteenth century, we have added 
dramatically to our picture of human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. The 
Human Genome Project is thus the next stage in an epic voyage of discovery -- a 
voyage that will bring us to a profound understanding of human biology. </P>
<P>In an important way, though, the genome project is very different from many 
of our exploratory adventures. It is spurred by a conviction of practical value, 
a certainty that human benefits will follow in the wake of success. The product 
of the Human Genome Project will be an enormously rich biological database, the 
key to tracking down every human gene -- and thus to unveiling, and eventually 
to subverting, the causes of thousands of human diseases. The sequence of our 
genome will ultimately allow us to unlock the secrets of life's processes, the 
biochemical underpinnings of our senses and our memory, our development and our 
aging, our similarities and our differences. </P>
<P>It has further been said that the Human Genome Project is <I>guaranteed</I> 
to succeed: Its goal is nothing more assuming than a sequence of three billion 
characters. And we have a very good idea of how to read those characters. Unlike 
perilous voyages or searches for unknown subatomic particles, this venture is 
assured of its goal. But beyond a detailed picture of human DNA, no one can 
predict the form success will take. The genome project itself offers no promises 
of cancer cures or quick fixes for Alzheimer's disease, no detailed 
understanding of genius or schizophrenia. But if we are ever to uncover the 
mysteries of carcinogenesis, if we are ever to know how biochemistry contributes 
to mental illness and dementia, if we ever hope to really understand the 
processes of growth and development, we must first have a detailed map of the 
genetic landscape. That's what the Human Genome Project promises. In a way, it's 
a rather prosaic step, but what lies beyond is breathtaking. </P>
