<BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;ANIMAL WASTE POLLUTION IN AMERICA: <BR>AN EMERGING NATIONAL PROBLEM 
<P>Environmental Risks Of <BR>Livestock &amp; Poultry Production <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P>December 1997 <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Report Compiled by the Minority Staff of the <BR>United States Senate 
Committee <BR>on Agriculture, Nutrition, &amp; Forestry <BR>for 
<P>Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) <BR>Ranking Member 
<P> <BR>&nbsp;Over the past few years, I have heard increasing concerns in my 
home state of Iowa about the potential for animal waste pollution from intensive 
livestock and poultry operations.&nbsp; The concentration of animal waste from 
larger and larger operations has led to more complaints about odor, greater 
challenges for animal waste management, and a growing public opinion that more 
environmental protections are needed. 
<P>&nbsp;I was surprised to learn that nationwide 130 times more animal manure 
is produced than human waste -- five tons for every U.S. citizen -- and that 
some operations produce as much waste as a town or even a city!&nbsp; As animals 
become increasingly concentrated in certain regions of the country and on larger 
operations, there is not always enough crop land to use all of the manure as 
fertilizer.&nbsp; These increasing concentrations of manure mean that the risk 
of water pollution from waste spills, runoff from fields and leakage from 
storage facilities is also increasing. 
<P>&nbsp;Furthermore, Federal regulations do not address the handling, storage, 
land application or disposal of manure.&nbsp; In fact, the Inspector General of 
the Environmental Protection Agency recently reported that "Federal regulations 
inadequately protect water quality from animal waste." 
<P>&nbsp;The following report explains why I believe that the threat of 
pollution from intensive livestock and poultry farms is a national 
problem.&nbsp; Dairy farms in New York and California, poultry farms around the 
Chesapeake Bay outside of Washington, D.C., and hog farms in North Carolina and 
Iowa are just some of the places where animal waste has been identified as an 
environmental problem. 
<P>&nbsp;I have introduced the Animal Agriculture Reform Act (S. 1323) in the 
Senate, the first bill of its kind introduced in Congress, as a national 
approach to animal waste problems.&nbsp; My bill would set environmental 
standards for animal waste handling by large livestock and poultry operations, 
and require those operations to follow waste management plans approved by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
<P>&nbsp;While most livestock and poultry producers are responsible stewards, 
the increasing concentration of animal waste is an environmental challenge with 
national environmental and human health consequences.&nbsp; This is a challenge 
we must deal with at the national level.&nbsp; National standards also would 
help prevent larger producers from moving from state to state seeking weaker 
environmental regulations. 
<P>&nbsp; Because of the national importance of this issue, we should move 
quickly to establish common sense safeguards that will both protect our 
environment and ensure a sustainable livestock industry.&nbsp; My bill seeks to 
resolve these problems in ways that are both environmentally responsible and 
economically feasible for livestock and poultry producers.&nbsp; I look forward 
to Congressional review of my bill and other proposals early in the upcoming 
session. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER>Executive Summary</CENTER>
<P>The Animal Waste Problem 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nationwide, 130 times more animal manure is produced than human 
waste -- <BR>&nbsp; 5 tons for every person in the United States. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Applied to land in proper amounts, manure is a valuable source 
of nitrogen, phosphorus and other crop nutrients -- but more and more animals on 
larger farms means there is not enough crop land in some areas to use all of the 
manure. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Agriculture reported recently that "The 
continued intensification of animal production systems without regard to the 
adequacy of the available land base for manure recycling presents a serious 
policy problem." 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Inadequate animal waste management practices often lead to water 
pollution, yet there are no Federal regulations for waste handling, storage, use 
or disposal. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Waste spills occur when earthen manure storage lagoons collapse, 
equipment breaks, or people make mistakes -- and leaking lagoons and runoff from 
fields can cause chronic animal waste pollution of both surface and ground 
water. 
<P>National Solutions 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Animal Agriculture Reform Act addresses animal waste 
pollution problems by requiring large animal feeding operations to develop 
animal waste management plans that would follow new environmental standards. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any national approach to the animal waste problem should include 
the following policies, found in the Animal Agriculture Reform Act: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmentally sound standards should be set for the 
handling, storage, and use or disposal of animal waste. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific standards similar to those for human waste should 
require treatment of excess manure that cannot be used for a beneficial purpose. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal waste management practices must limit the 
application of both phosphorous and nitrogen in animal manure to amounts needed 
by crops. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Environmental Protection Agency should maintain its 
regulatory role, but the Department of Agriculture should be actively engaged in 
setting new animal waste management standards and helping farmers implement 
sound environmental practices for livestock and poultry production. <BR>Animal 
Waste Pollution 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 60 percent of rivers and streams that EPA has identified as 
"impaired," agricultural runoff, including nutrients from animal waste, is the 
largest contributor to pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 35 million gallons of spilled animal waste killed 10 million 
fish in North Carolina in 1995.&nbsp; Last year more than 40 animal waste spills 
killed 670,000 fish in Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri, up from 20 spills in 1992. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal wastes carry parasites, bacteria and viruses -- and can 
pollute drinking water with high levels of nitrates, potentially fatal to 
infants. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutrient pollution can come from a number of sources, but in 
areas of intensive livestock production, animal waste is a leading suspect in 
blooms of toxic microbes linked to excessive nutrients: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997, outbreaks of the toxic microbe Pfiesteria 
piscicida killed approximately 450,000 fish in North Carolina and approximately 
30,000 fish in the Chesapeake Bay (Delaware, Maryland and Virginia). 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1972 and 1995, the number of coastal and estuarine 
waters that host major, recurring attacks by harmful microbes has doubled. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 species of harmful dinoflagellates were known in 1982; 
now there are over 60. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Excessive growth and decay of algae in nutrient enriched waters 
depletes available oxygen.&nbsp; In the Gulf of Mexico, nutrients from farm 
runoff including animal waste is linked to the formation of a "dead zone" of 
hypoxia (low oxygen) -- up to 7,000 square miles of water that cannot support 
most aquatic life.

1,365,661,300 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The manure from a 200-head dairy operation produces as much 
nitrogen as is in the sewage from a community of 5,000-10,000 people. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual litter from a typical broiler house of 22,000 birds 
contains as much phosphorous as is in the sewage from a community of 6,000 
people. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1,600 dairies in the Central Valley of California produce 
more waste than a city of 21 million people. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Delmarva Peninsula outside of Washington, D.C., 600 
million chickens a year produce over 3.2 billion pounds of raw waste each year 
-- as much nitrogen as from a city of almost 500,000. 
<P>Livestock Production &amp; Concentration 
<P>&nbsp;Increasing concerns about the environmental consequences of livestock 
and poultry production are related to the increasing concentration of animals in 
certain areas of the country and on larger farms.

103 Million (1995) <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cattle (non-dairy)&nbsp;&nbsp; 58 Million 
(1995) 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past 15 years the number of hog farms has dropped from 
600,000 to 157,000, yet these farms still produce about the same number of hogs. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cattle industry, 2 percent of feed operations account for 
over 40 percent of all cattle sold. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1969 and 1992, the number of farms with broiler houses 
fell by 35 percent, but during the same time production nearly tripled. 
<CENTER>Animal Waste &amp; The Environment</CENTER>
<CENTER></CENTER>&nbsp;Animal waste from intensive livestock and poultry 
production presents serious risks of environmental pollution.&nbsp; In 60 
percent of rivers and streams that EPA has identified as "impaired," 
agricultural runoff, including nutrients from animal waste, is the largest 
contributor to pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;Nationwide, 130 times more animal waste is produced than human waste -- 
5 tons per person -- making some large livestock operations the waste equivalent 
of a town or even a large city.&nbsp; One dramatic example is a 50,000 acre 
swine operation in southwest Utah designed to produce 2.5 million hogs annually, 
with a potential waste output greater than entire city of Los Angeles, 
California. 
<P>&nbsp;The lack of sufficient land on which to safely apply the manure from 
ever larger livestock operations has created what the Department of Agriculture 
calls "a serious policy problem." 
<P>Improper Handling of Animal Waste Leads to Water Pollution 
<P>&nbsp;Both liquid and dry animal manure can be a valuable source of crop 
nutrients.&nbsp; But when manure is applied to land in amounts greater than can 
be used by crops and retained by the soil, nitrogen, phosphorous and other 
nutrients leach and run off into surface and groundwater. 
<P>&nbsp;Leaching from earthen waste storage lagoons also may pollute ground 
water.&nbsp; Following a disastrous series of spills in 1995 in North Carolina, 
researchers examined manure lagoons across the state and found that half of the 
lagoons constructed prior to 1993 were leaking liquid manure into the soil and 
groundwater. 
<P>&nbsp;The risk of water pollution from dry poultry litter is greatest after 
it is spread on crop land, while the risk of waste spills and chronic pollution 
is always present in liquid waste storage and application systems (hogs and 
cattle).&nbsp; Equipment or structural failures or human error can lead to waste 
spills while liquid waste is being transported, stored or applied to land.&nbsp; 
Earthen lagoons, for example, may be vulnerable to outright collapse if 
overloaded or poorly maintained. 
<P>&nbsp;Spills of liquid animal waste directly into water have an immediate 
environmental impact, choking out fish and other aquatic life.&nbsp; In 
addition, the excessive growth and decay of algae and other aquatic organisms 
that feed on excessive nutrients in water deplete dissolved oxygen.&nbsp; The 
resulting hypoxia (low oxygen) from chronic nutrient enrichment can result in 
fish kills, odor and overall degradation of water quality. 
<P>&nbsp;Serious spills of animal waste into waterways have occurred frequently 
in recent years.&nbsp; An informal survey of leading livestock-producing states 
indicates that state enforcement actions taken in response to spills or 
discharges nearly doubled between 1992 and 1995.&nbsp; In Iowa, Minnesota and 
Missouri (accounting for 36 percent of hog production), recorded animal waste 
spills rose from 20 in 1992 (killing at least 55,000 fish) to more than 40 in 
1996 (killing at least 670,000 fish). 
<P>&nbsp;It has long been known that nitrogen is highly soluble and susceptible 
to leaching and run off.&nbsp; Only recently has it been fully understood that 
when soils are saturated with phosphorous, excess phosphorous also will run 
off.&nbsp; Traditionally, application rates of manure have been set by the 
amount of nitrogen going onto the land.&nbsp; But because the phosphorus content 
of manure is proportionally much higher than nitrogen (in relation to crop 
nutrient needs), this practice can lead to the application of excess 
phosphorous. 
<P>Typical Animal Waste Management Practices 
<P>&nbsp;Animal waste consists of not only manure and urine, but also of dead 
animals, used bedding, waste feed, and other residual organic matter.&nbsp; All 
of these materials are potential sources of crop nutrients, but also can pose 
environmental threats. 
<P>&nbsp;The composition of animal waste depends on both the kind of animal and 
the way the waste is handled.&nbsp; Poultry operations typically produce dry 
litter, with about 15-25 percent moisture content, that may be mixed with straw 
or another dry material for easier handling.&nbsp; The removed litter is stacked 
and stored in metal or wooden structures, or on the ground on a temporary basis. 

<P>&nbsp;Hogs and cattle generate a manure that is more liquid, and typically 
water is used to flush the manure out of the barns and into storage 
facilities.&nbsp; The resulting "slurry" is up to 97 percent liquid, and most 
commonly stored in earthen lagoons.&nbsp; An alternative storage method now 
being adopted more widely is the "slurry tank," which offers a greater level of 
structural stability and environmental protection. 
<P>&nbsp;In the lagoons or tanks, many of the solids (including much of the 
phosphorous) settle into a sludge at the bottom.&nbsp; Most nitrogen remains 
dissolved in the water or volatilizes into the atmosphere.&nbsp; A farmer who 
utilizes the animal waste for nutrients pumps the liquid out for nutrients or 
irrigation, and may agitate the sludge at pumping time to capture the nutrients 
that otherwise would remain behind. 
<P>Where National Standards Are Needed 
<P>&nbsp;Figure 1 below illustrates several poultry waste handling methods; 
Figure 2 illustrates several methods for handling hog waste.&nbsp; The waste 
management practices pictured here, however, are not adequate for environmental 
protection unless the farmer also follows proper standards for building and 
maintaining the storage facilities, handling manure properly, and spreading 
manure in limited quantities on the fields.&nbsp; There are no Federal 
regulations setting these standards. 
<P>&nbsp;Waste storage lagoons that may be called "waste treatment lagoons" are 
typically for waste storage only.&nbsp; Because many of the solids settle into a 
sludge at the bottom of a waste lagoon, some operations use multiple lagoons for 
repeated settling and can recapture water that is clean enough to recycle for 
flushing the barns. 
<P>&nbsp;Even these recycling systems, however, do not follow the environmental 
standards associated with the treatment of human waste.&nbsp; For adequate 
protection of the environment and human health, treatment similar to that for 
municipal wastewater should be followed (as discussed below). 
<P>Human Health Concerns 
<P>&nbsp;Much current attention is focused on the direct impacts of animal waste 
on aquatic ecosystems, but there are also human health concerns associated with 
animal waste pollution that should be studied further.&nbsp; Manure contains 
pathogens to which humans are vulnerable, including Salmonella and 
Cryptosporidium, and can pollute drinking water with nitrates, potentially fatal 
to infants.&nbsp; More indirectly, microbes that are toxic to animals and people 
are thought to thrive in waters that have excessively high levels of nutrients 
from sources including animal waste pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;Adopting environmentally responsible animal waste management practices, 
such as those set forth in the Animal Agriculture Reform Act, would help 
mitigate a number of these serious potential human health threats.&nbsp; By 
containing animal waste properly, observing application limits for use of manure 
as fertilizer, and applying treatment standards to excess manure, the human 
health impacts of animal waste can be minimized.

<CENTER>&nbsp;Animal Waste Treatment</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;The Animal Agriculture Reform Act calls for treatment of animal waste, 
when necessary, much as municipal sewage is treated.&nbsp; When too much liquid 
manure is produced to be used for crop nutrients or another beneficial use, it 
should be treated to ensure adequate protection of the environment and human 
health. 
<P>&nbsp;Treatment requirements similar to those that apply to human waste 
should be considered as part of any comprehensive approach to managing the 1.3 
billion tons of animal manure produced annually. 
<P>Municipal Wastewater Treatment 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary treatment -- Larger solids are removed from the water by 
screening, grinding and settling.&nbsp; Settled solids are removed for 
decomposition, and eventually may need further treatment before disposal. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary treatment -- Dissolved organic materials are reduced 
by biological decomposition. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tertiary treatment -- Additional filtration, if necessary, 
increases the quality of the water and reduces the need for disinfection. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Disinfection stage --&nbsp; Most of the remaining viruses and 
bacteria are killed (usually with chlorine). 
<P>&nbsp;Some waste storage and application systems on livestock farms are 
rudimentary waste treatment systems.&nbsp; High volumes of water are used to 
flush out the manure into below-building pits, and then into waste 
lagoons.&nbsp; In a lagoon or tank, many of the solids settle into a sludge at 
the bottom.&nbsp; By using multiple lagoons for repeated settling, a livestock 
operation can recapture water from the waste stream that is clean enough to 
recycle for flushing the barns.&nbsp; Typically such "treatment," however, is 
designed only to recycle water, not to provide environmental safeguards. 
<P>Composting 
<P>&nbsp;Composting animal waste prior to land application offers significant 
benefits, although currently it is practical only for dry waste (poultry) 
operations.&nbsp; The composting of manure, dead animals and other organic 
materials breaks down organic compounds so they may be more readily used by 
crops, and the high heat naturally generated by composting kills 
pathogens.&nbsp; For these reasons, composting may be an adequate treatment for 
dry waste.&nbsp; Composted dry waste also may be sold commercially for 
fertilizer. <BR>&nbsp; 
<CENTER>Animal Waste Pollution -- Examples</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 60 percent of rivers and streams identified by EPA as 
"impaired," agricultural runoff, including animal waste, is the largest 
contributor to pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995 in North Carolina: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35 million 
gallons of animal waste spilled into the state's waterways. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kills of 10 million fish were attributed largely to 
animal waste pollution. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal waste pollution closed 
over 360,000 acres of coastal wetlands to shellfish harvesting. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri -- accounting for 36 percent of 
1996 U.S. swine production -- recorded animal waste spills rose from 20 in 1992 
(killing at least 55,000 fish) to more than 40 in 1996 (killing at least 670,000 
fish). 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1972 and 1995, the number of coastal and estuarine 
waters that host major, recurring attacks by harmful microbes has doubled -- and 
nutrient enrichment from sources including animal waste is the leading suspect. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997, approximately 450,000 fish were killed in North 
Carolina by the toxic microbe Pfiesteria piscicida, whose increased presence in 
estuarine waters is linked to excess nutrients from animal waste and farm 
runoff. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997, an estimated 30,000 fish were killed in the 
Chesapeake Bay by Pfiesteria, implicating nutrient runoff from the poultry farms 
on the Delmarva Peninsula that produce over 600 million birds per year. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms reported among people with close exposure to 
Pfiesteria in its toxic form include memory loss, respiratory problems and skin 
rashes. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 species of harmful dinoflagellates were known in 1982; 
now there are over 60. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public concerns about nutrient enrichment of waterways 
also have been heightened by other attacks by toxic algae and microbes in recent 
years: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 people dead and 100 sick in Canada 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 162 dolphins, a sea lion and at least 4 whales dead 
in Mexico <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of tropical fish dead off 
Florida <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 304 dead manatees in Florida 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of brown pelicans dead in California 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gulf of Mexico:&nbsp; Nutrients from farm runoff, including 
animal waste, are linked to the formation of a so-called "dead zone" of hypoxia 
(low oxygen) in the Gulf as large as 7,000 square miles. <BR>Animal Waste 
Production&nbsp; -- Fact Sheet &amp; Maps 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following maps detail concentrations of manure across the 
country, measured by both nitrogen and phosphorous from manure.&nbsp; This 
concentration makes it significantly more difficult to effectively manage animal 
waste and utilize manure for such beneficial uses as fertilizer. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maps soon to be released by USDA indicate that in a number of 
these areas of high concentration there is simply not enough crop land to 
utilize the manure.

1,365,661,300 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; More than five tons of animal manure are produced each year for 
every person in the United States, compared to about 80 pounds of solid human 
waste. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual production of over 600 million chickens on the 
Delmarva Peninsula (the Chesapeake&nbsp; Bay tri-state area) yields: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 3.2 billion pounds of raw waste each year. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.8 million pounds of phosphorous. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48.2 million pounds of nitrogen -- as much nitrogen as in

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1,600 dairies in the Central Valley of California produce 
more waste than a city of 21 million people. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A 50,000 acre swine operation under construction in Utah is

<CENTER>Livestock Concentration -- Fact Sheet, Charts &amp; Map</CENTER>&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;Increasing concerns about the environmental consequences of livestock 
and poultry production are related to the increasing concentration of animals in 
certain areas of the country and on larger farms.&nbsp; The resulting 
concentrations of manure make it much more difficult to manage waste responsibly 
and utilize all the manure for fertilizer. 
<P>&nbsp;This concentration of animals without sufficient crop land in those 
areas for manure application is an increasing problem.&nbsp; In 1992, for 
example, the largest hog operations (more than 2,500 hogs per farm) held more 
than 27 percent of the nation's hogs but owned only 3 percent of crop land 
associated with animal operations. 
<P>&nbsp;The following charts show that while the number of farms raising 
various types of livestock and poultry have declined, the number of animals 
produced has risen at the same time.&nbsp; The map following the charts shows 
the regions where these animals are now concentrated. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Livestock Production in the United States 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Broilers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

103 Million (1995) <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cattle (non-dairy)&nbsp;&nbsp; 58 Million 
(1995) 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty years ago there were more than a million hog farms across 
the country.&nbsp; Over the past 15 the number of hog farms has dropped from 
600,000 to 157,000, yet the country's hog invyears entory has remained almost 
the same. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of increased concentration, just 3 percent of the 
nation's hog farms produce more than 50 percent of the nation's hogs. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 percent of cattle feed operations account for over 40 percent 
of all cattle sold. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1969 and 1992, the number of farms with broiler houses 
fell by 35 percent, but during the same time production nearly tripled. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996, 55 percent of hog production took place in four 
states.&nbsp; In the same year, the four-state concentration for poultry 
production was 53 percent. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of 640,000 U.S. livestock farms, 450,000 are confined 
feedlot operations. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 6,600 of those animal feeding operations account for about 
35% of total US livestock production. <BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER>Current National Actions</CENTER>
<P>Clinton Administration Clean Water Action Plan 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, Vice President Gore directed the Environmental 
Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture to work with other Federal 
agencies to develop a Clean Water Action Plan by February 14, 1998.&nbsp; The 
Plan will describe specific actions that Federal agencies will take to:&nbsp; 1) 
protect public health; 2) prevent polluted runoff; and 3) promote 
community-based watershed management. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vice President listed animal feeding operations as a key 
source of water pollution to be addressed by the Action Plan. 
<P>Environmental Protection Agency 
<P>&nbsp;EPA is considering actions to address animal waste pollution, 
including: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; New Clean Water Act regulations; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased 
inspections of operations; and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepped up enforcement against 
polluting operations. 
<P>Department of Agriculture 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; USDA is working with EPA on the Administration's Clean Water 
Action Plan.&nbsp; The Natural Resources Conservation Service is reviewing and 
revising guidelines on animal waste management. 
<P>National Environmental Dialogue on Pork Production 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Environmental Dialogue on Pork Production (NEDPP) 
is a working group composed of the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, several state environmental and agriculture departments, and 
individual pork producers affiliated with the National Pork Producers Council. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This month, the NEDPP recommended that environmental regulations 
for swine operations: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply to all sizes of commercial operations. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Require new operations to comply with recognized 
engineering standards. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit manure application by crop 
nutrient needs and soil nutrient levels. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Require 
certification and training for facility operators. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Require setbacks from water bodies, residences and other public facilities. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow public notice and comment on proposed operations. 
<CENTER>The Animal Agriculture Reform Act, S. 1323</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) introduced the Animal Agriculture Reform Act 
in the United States Senate on October 28, 1997.&nbsp; The bill calls for 
national environmental standards for the handling of animal waste by large 
animal feeding operations.&nbsp; These standards would be implemented through 
mandatory animal waste management plans approved by the Department of 
Agriculture. 
<P>&nbsp;The bill does not interfere with the regulatory role of the 
Environmental Protection Agency or state governments.&nbsp; Instead, it provides 
a directive for USDA to implement waste management standards on individual 
farms.&nbsp; USDA is not required to monitor for pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;Under the Animal Agriculture Reform Act: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Livestock and poultry operations would submit detailed plans to 
USDA for: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimizing animal waste runoff and leaching into water. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating, monitoring, maintaining and inspecting waste 
storage facilities. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Handling, transporting, storing, 
applying and treating animal waste. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building containment 
systems according to national technical standards. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Containing accidental waste spills. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Manure may not be applied in amounts that exceed crop nutrient 
requirements and increase the risk of water pollution. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid manure that cannot be applied in accordance with nutrient 
restrictions or put to another beneficial use must be treated in accordance with 
waste water treatment standards. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding for USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program 
would be quadrupled from $200 million per year to $800 million per year, and 
assistance for smaller operations to prepare animal waste management plans would 
be a priority. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal owners are responsible for preparing and complying with 
the animal waste management plan, even if they contract with others to raise the 
animals. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If EPA or a state finds that an operation is a significant 
polluter, USDA must review the operation's compliance with its management 
plan.&nbsp; USDA may close an operation that does not comply with its plan or 
fails to file an approved plan. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; State and local governments may apply tougher standards than 
those in the bill. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Waste management plans are mandatory for operations over an 
approximate capacity of 1,330 hogs; 57,000 chickens; 270 dairy cattle; or 640 
feeder cattle. 
<CENTER>Current Regulations &amp; Programs</CENTER>
<P>The Environmental Protection Agency 
<P>&nbsp;Several Federal statutes under the Environmental Protection Agency's 
jurisdiction cover some aspect of animal feeding operations.&nbsp; Of these, the 
Clean Water Act is the most significant.&nbsp; However, regulations under this 
statute are limited, and do not cover such critical issues as land application 
of manure, nutrient management, animal waste management plans and engineering 
standards. 
<P>The Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA) 
<P>&nbsp;The CWA is the most significant federal statute covering livestock 
operations.&nbsp; Under the CWA, no point source may discharge pollutants unless 
it is in accordance with a permit issued by EPA or a state under EPA's National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The CWA defines a "point source" as:&nbsp; "any discernible, 
confined, and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, 
channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, 
concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), or vessel or other floating craft, 
from which pollutants are or may be discharged." 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The CWA does not specifically define a CAFO.&nbsp; EPA's 
regulations, written in 1976, define a CAFO as an animal feeding facility in 
which animals are confined for 45 days or more out of a 12-month period, over 
which no crops or forage growth is sustained, and that either: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains 1,000 animal units and has the potential to 
discharge pollutants into water by any means; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains over 300 animal units and is discharging 
pollutants through a man-made device (e.g., pipes or ditches) directly into a 
water body; or 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is designated a CAFO after a site inspection determines 
that the operation is or has the potential to be a significant polluter, no 
matter its size. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000 pound "animal units" equal 1,000 slaughter and feeder 
cattle; 700 dairy cattle; 2,500 hogs; 500 horses; or 10,000 sheep.&nbsp; For 
poultry, 1,000 animal units are equivalent to about 250,000 layers; 455,000 
broilers; or 66,700 turkeys.&nbsp; (EPA's CAFO regulations set different 
thresholds for poultry, using 55,000 turkeys and from 30,000 to 100,000 chickens 
depending on the type of operation.) <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;An NPDES permit 
prohibits discharges to water except those resulting from a storm exceeding a 
25-year, 24 hour storm (i.e., the number of inches of rainfall in a 24-hour 
period that it is expected only once every 25 years).&nbsp; An animal feeding 
operation that only discharges in the event of a 25-year, 24-hour storm is not 
considered a CAFO. 
<P>Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; CZARA calls upon states with federally-approved coastal zone 
management programs (voluntary programs under the original Coastal Zone 
Management Act of 1972) to implement coastal nonpoint pollution control 
programs.&nbsp; EPA's technical guidance for such nonpoint control programs 
includes management measures for "confined animal facilities." 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although CZARA management measures apply to farms smaller than 
those specified under the CWA CAFO regulations, any CAFO with an NPDES permit is 
exempt from CZARA requirements. 
<P>Safe Drinking Water Act 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the SDWA, animal feeding operations that are identified as 
a source of groundwater contamination, are within a designated wellhead 
protection area, or that are located near public water systems may be subject to 
additional discharge limitations or management practices. 
<P>The United States Department of Agriculture 
<P>&nbsp;USDA does not have regulations that govern animal waste 
management.&nbsp; However, the Natural Resources Conservation Service provides 
conservation assistance to farmers that includes waste and nutrient management 
for livestock and poultry farms. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), 
established by the 1996 Farm Bill: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USDA enters into 5- to 10-year contracts with farmers to 
provide financial, technical and educational assistance for conservation 
measures.&nbsp; Farmers must implement a conservation plan. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farmers may receive cost-share payments and incentive 
payments for conservation measures including manure management facilities and 
nutrient management plans. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty percent of EQIP funding is targeted to livestock 
production.&nbsp; Owners of large confined livestock operations (over 1,000 
animal units--see discussion under the Clean Water Act above) are not eligible 
for cost-share assistance for animal waste storage or treatment 
facilities.&nbsp; Technical, educational, and financial assistance may be 
provided for other conservation practices on these large operations. 
<P>The States 
<P>&nbsp;A survey of 29 states indicates that laws regulating animal waste and 
manure management vary widely.&nbsp; State and local laws that affect the 
management of animal feeding operations generally regulate one or more of the 
following aspects:&nbsp; (1) size or structure of operations; (2) location of 
facilities; and (3) practices of the operation.&nbsp; A number of states have 
used the NPDES program as a starting point, and have added additional 
requirements to those found in EPA's NPDES regulations. 
<P>&nbsp;Many states and localities have enacted new laws and regulations very 
recently, and this is an area of intense activity.&nbsp; North Carolina and 
Kentucky, for example, recently imposed moratoria on the construction of most 
new livestock operations. 
<P>&nbsp;Among aspects of livestock operations regulated by various states are: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Separation distances between livestock operations and water 
wells, private homes, or property lines; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amounts of land 
available for manure application; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Manure application methods 
and amounts; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity of manure storage structures; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowable seepage from waste lagoons; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Construction standards; and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Disposal of dead animals. 
<P>&nbsp;In some states, disputes have arisen as to whether local jurisdictions 
have the authority to regulate livestock and poultry operations.&nbsp; Among the 
sources of legal authority advanced to justify local control are zoning and 
health ordinances.&nbsp; Typically, proponents of local control are seeking more 
stringent regulation than is provided by state law. <BR>&nbsp; 
<CENTER>Conclusion</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;Animal waste pollution is a national problem, and current Federal 
regulations are an inadequate solution.&nbsp; There are no regulations at the 
national level that set specific requirements for the storage or application of 
manure, nutrient management, animal waste management plans or construction 
standards. 
<P>&nbsp;Although many states are grappling with this issue on their own, new 
minimum environmental standards for animal waste management should be 
established at the Federal level to ensure nationwide protection of the 
environment and human health. 
<P>&nbsp;While the Environmental Protection Agency should maintain its 
regulatory role, the Department of Agriculture should be actively engaged in 
setting new animal waste management standards.&nbsp; USDA is the only Federal 
department with a national staff in place to help farmers implement sound 
environmental practices for livestock and poultry production. 
<P>&nbsp;As part of any new Federal approach to this issue, all large livestock 
and poultry operations should be required to adopt animal waste management plans 
that: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the application of both phosphorous and nitrogen to the 
amounts that can be used by crops. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Detail safe methods for handling, storing and applying or 
disposing of manure. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify how excess manure that cannot be used for crop nutrients 
or another beneficial purpose will be treated to minimize environmental threats. 

<P>&nbsp;Animal waste is not the only threat to water quality.&nbsp; But action 
must be taken now to minimize the risks to our nation's ground and surface water 
from livestock and poultry production.&nbsp; Comprehensive national standards 
for animal waste management, such as those set forth in the Animal Agriculture 
Reform Act, are an important step toward improving water quality across America.
