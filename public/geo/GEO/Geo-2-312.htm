      <P>Statistics Canada figures show Nunavut's population at the time of its 
      formation in 1999 was approximately 27,000. Unlike Yukon and NWT, a large 
      proportion of the population does not reside in a single community <A 
      href="http://www.city.iqaluit.nu.ca/demographics/demographics.htm#" 
      onclick="open('demotable1.htm', 'table1', 'resizable=no, scrollbars=no, toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, width=535, height=387, top=50, left=100');"><I>(Table 
      1)</I></A>. The City of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, is the largest 
      community with a population of 5,000. Rankin Inlet is the second largest 
      community with a population of approximately 2,200. Eight other 
      communities have populations over 1,000 people including Cambridge Bay. 
      Approximately half of the population resides in the Baffin region, with 
      roughly 30 per cent residing in the Keewatin or Kivalliq region and 20 per 
      cent residing in the Kitikmeot region.</P>
      <P>Inuit represent approximately 85 per cent of the population, but for 
      communities other than Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay the 
      percentage of Inuit is closer to 95 per cent. As such, the percentage of 
      aboriginal peoples is higher in Nunavut than in Yukon (21 per cent), NWT 
      (48 per cent) and Greenland (80 per cent). According to the 1996 Census, 
      Inuktitut is the dominant language in Nunavut with 60 per cent speaking it 
      at home compared with 35 per cent speaking English.</P>
      <P>There are some important aspects about Nunavut's population that 
      distinguish it from the population of other jurisdictions in Canada, and 
      which will have implications for Nunavut's economic development. The first 
      aspect pertains to the Territory's rapid growth in population over the 
      past several decades. For example, Nunavut experienced an increase in 
      population by 32 per cent between 1986 and 1996. Most of this growth is 
      due to natural increase as high birth rates were accompanied with 
      increased life expectancy rates due in part to improvements in health 
      related services.<FONT size=1><B><I>35</I></B></FONT> Nunavut's population 
      growth rate (16.4 per cent) was more than three times the national average 
      (5.7 per cent) between 1991 and 1996. Nunavut's population is expected to 
      reach over 32,000 by 2006 and over 43,000 by 2020 according to Nunavummit 
      Kiglisiniartiit (Nunavut Bureau of Statistics). By 2010 it is expected 
      that there will be more people residing in Nunavut than in Yukon. However, 
      it should be noted that Nunavut's population growth rate growth has been 
      slowing, as has its fertility rate due to Inuit women having fewer 
      children.</P>

      <P>The high population growth rate over the past several years has 
      resulted in Nunavut having the youngest population in Canada <A

      2)</I></A>. Approximately 60 per cent of the population are under 25 years 
      of age-92 per cent of whom are Inuit-and 41 per cent of the population are 
      under 16 years. So, unlike most of Canada <A

      onclick="open('demochart1.htm', 'chart1', 'resizable=no, scrollbars=no, toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, width=615, height=410, top=50, left=100');">(Chart 
      1)</A>, Nunavut has a very large segment of the population that is quite 
      young and that will likely dominate public policy in Nunavut for years to 
      come (e.g., the need for increased demand for educational related 
      services, youth employment opportunities).<FONT
