      src="Geo-2-073_files/a-dropcap.gif" width=41>quatic nuisance species (ANS) 
      are nonindigenous species that threaten the diversity or abundance of 
      native species or the ecological stability of infested waters, or 
      commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities 
      dependent on such waters. ANS include nonindigenous species that may occur 
      in inland, estuarine and marine waters and that presently or potentially 
      threaten ecological processes and natural resources. In addition to 
      adversely affecting activities dependant on waters of the United States, 
      ANS adversely affect individuals, including health 
      effects.<BR><BR>Nonindigenous species (NIS) are any species or other 
      viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic 
      range, including any such organism transferred from one country into 
      another. Nonindigenous species include both exotics and transplants. 
      Synonyms for NIS include introduced, foreign, exotic, alien, non-native, 
      immigrant and transplants.<BR><BR>The table below provides a list of the 3 
      classes of adverse impacts caused by aquatic nuisance 
  species:<BR><BR></TD></TR>

    <TD colSpan=3 width=482>Nonindigenous aquatic species impact biological 
      and economic resources and can also impact human health. Nonindigenous 
      species disturb native species through predation or displacement, clog 
      intake pipes for municipal and industrial water supplies and can pose 
      serious human health risks.<BR><BR>Great Lakes water users spend tens of 
      millions of dollars on zebra mussel control every year. Affected 
      municipalities and industries, using large volumes of Great Lakes water, 
      expend approximately $360,000 per year on zebra mussel control; small 
      municipalities average $20,000. Nuclear power plants average an additional 
      $825,000 of additional costs per year for zebra mussel control. As the 
      zebra mussel spreads to inland lakes and rivers across North America, such 
      as the Mississippi River Basin and Lake Champlain, so do the costs to 
      water users. Other invading species of fish (such as the sea lamprey, 
      ruffe and round goby) can harm native fish. Reductions in native fish 
      populations (such as lake trout, walleye, yellow perch and catfish) 
      threaten a sport and commercial fishing industry that is valued at almost 
      $4.5 billion annually and supports 81,000 jobs.<BR><BR>Zebra mussel 
      infestations cause pronounced ecological changes in the Great Lakes and 
      major rivers of the central United States. The zebra mussel's rapid 
      reproduction, coupled with consumption of microscopic plants and animals, 
      affects the aquatic food web and places valuable commercial and sport 
      fisheries at risk. In waters infested with the zebra mussel, large blooms 
      of potentially toxic blue-green algae have been observed in waters such as 
      Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron and the western basin of Lake 
      Erie.<BR><BR>Nonindigenous aquatic nuisance plants, such as purple 
      loosestrife, Eurasian watermilfoil and hydrilla quickly establish 
      themselves replacing native plants. Environmental and economic problems 
      caused by the dense growth of these weeds include impairment of 
      water-based recreation, navigation and flood control, degradation of water 
      quality and fish and wildlife habitat, accelerated filling of lakes and 
      reservoirs and depressed property values.<BR><BR>ANS invasions also can 
      pose serious health risks. A South American strain of human cholera 
      bacteria was found in ballast tanks in the port of Mobile, Alabama in 
      1991. Cholera strains were also found in oyster and fin-fish samples in 
      Mobile Bay, resulting in a public health advisory to avoid handling or 
      eating raw oysters or seafood.<BR><BR></TD></TR>
