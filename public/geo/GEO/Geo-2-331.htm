<H1>Progress and Challenges in Reducing Losses from Natural Disasters</H1>
<H2>NSTC/CENR Subcommittee for Natural Disaster Reduction</H2>
<P>Adapted from an article in the recently published book <STRONG>Natural 
Disaster Management</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Abstract</EM></STRONG>. The fundamental premise for the United 
Nations’ International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has been that 
disasters result primarily from social causes and can therefore be addressed 
through changes in public policy. The end of the Decade provides an opportunity 
to reflect on the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain. 
During this 10-year period, the United States has initiated a significant policy 
shift, no longer relying on emergency response and recovery alone, but favoring 
greater emphasis on pre-event mitigation--a mix of engineering practice and 
other societal measures that can be taken in advance to reduce the risks, pain, 
and costs of disasters. Due in part to the delayed impact of past decisions, the 
costs of disasters continue to rise. Moreover, our scientific understanding of 
the nature of disasters, though available in broad terms, has significant gaps 
with regard to important specifics. In fact, advances in knowledge may actually 
be lagging behind the rapid mutation of natural disasters themselves in response 
to societal change.</P>

<P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></P>
<P>The conclusion of the United Nations’ International Decade for Natural 
Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) provides an important opportunity for agencies of the 
United States federal government to take stock. Where does the nation stand with 
respect to meeting the challenge of the IDNDR? What have been the major 
accomplishments of the Decade? What are the prospects for the future? What work 
remains to be done?</P>
<P>The National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on the Environment 
and Natural Resources/Subcommittee for Natural Disaster Reduction (SNDR) brings 
together 19 federal agencies to address these and related questions. This paper 
provides an assessment of where we stand. No attempt is made to provide an 
exhaustive inventory of ongoing federal work. Instead, the emphasis is on 
strategic aspects of the problem and the larger context.</P>
<P>The entire premise of the Decade is that so-called <EM>natural</EM> disasters 
are primarily <EM>social</EM> in origin. Earthquakes, storms, floods, drought, 
and other geophysical extremes are inevitable. Furthermore, many of these 
extremes confer benefits as well as pose a hazard. For example, many ecosystems 
have adapted to occasional wildfire, favored by drought; pyrophytic species in 
these ecosystems actually require fire for proper germination. Riverine habitats 
and ecosystems are often dependent upon annual floods, to such an extent that 
the U.S. Department of the Interior (DoI) has begun to reintroduce such flooding 
into the environment downstream of the Glen Canyon Dam.</P>
<P>By contrast, <EM>disasters</EM> - disruptions of entire communities, 
persisting after the hazardous event has come and gone, and exceeding the 
communities’ ability to recover unaided - reflect the ways societies do 
business. They result from decisions and policies with respect to land use, 
engineering practice, ecosystem management, and social institutions and 
frameworks.</P>
<P>As a result, disasters are evolving rapidly in response to major changes in 
our society--mutating in response to population increase, economic growth, the 
globalization of commerce, technological advances, and other trends now underway 
worldwide. The multi-disciplinary suite of activities known collectively as 
"natural disaster reduction" is barely keeping pace. The 1990's have seen a 
shift in U.S. national policy on natural disasters--a move away from primary 
reliance on emergency response and reconstruction after an event and toward 
greater emphasis on pre-event mitigation measures. Over time, the consequences 
of this change in approach could prove profound.</P><A name=background></A>
<P><STRONG>Background</STRONG></P>
<P>U.S. economic losses to natural hazards are highly uncertain, in part because 
of the difficulties in estimation (particularly with regard to resource losses 
and indirect business losses), and in part because there is no centrally 
assigned, multi-year responsibility for acquiring such data. However, it appears 
that losses have not declined during the Decade; instead, they have risen 
dramatically. Hurricane Andrew ($27 billion), the Midwest floods of 1993 ($21 
billion), and the Northridge earthquake of 1994 ($45 billion) each individually 
inflicted losses of tens of billions of dollars. Year-to-year damages fluctuate 
wildly, but it appears, on average, that the United States has been losing 
approximately $1 billion each week to natural disasters in recent years, based 
on an informal compilation carried out in 1997 by the White House Office on 
Science and Technology Policy. Even after adjusting for inflation, these costs 
appear to be doubling each decade.</P>
<P>This U.S. experience reflects similar global trends. Munich Reinsurance 
figures, which represent one of the longer records in this field, show a 
doubling or tripling of economic losses worldwide over each of the last several 
decades. Their 1996 press release suggested that losses for 1995, which included 
the Kobe earthquake (originally estimated to be some $100 billion), approached 
$180 billion. Since then, the figures have been adjusted upward, and some 
estimates for 1995 losses now approach $200 billion. Munich Reinsurance reported 
that 1998 was the most costly year ever for weather-related disasters, with 
losses from this source alone approaching $90 billion.</P>
<P>The U.S. loss figure of $1 billion per week might seem high but amounts to 
only 0.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The losses in affected states may 
amount to as much as 5% of the state domestic product. By contrast, the typical 
Chinese loss experience in bad years (such as 1998, which included substantial 
flooding) is in the range of 5-7% of GDP. For smaller nations, such as those in 
the Caribbean and Central America, a single event--for example, Hurricane 
Georges or Mitch--can produce losses of 50% of GDP. These hurricanes were not 
isolated instances. In 1974, for example, losses in Honduras resulting from 
Hurricane Fifi were equivalent to 50% of the 1973 GDP. Nor is the threat 
confined to developing nations. Estimates suggest that a repeat of the Great 
Kanto earthquake of 1923 would today cost Japan well over one trillion 
dollars--a significant fraction of its total economy.</P>
<P>Economic losses are rising for reasons that are likely to continue in the 
near term:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>a simple rise in the value of assets in harm’s way, as a result of 
  population increase and economic growth. 
  <LI>increasing use of hazardous lands (coastal zones, fault zones, flood 
  plains, unstable slopes, fire-prone areas, etc.) in response to both 
  population pressure and demographic preferences. 
  <LI>a continuing failure to use best seismic, wind, fire, and flood mitigation 
  and engineering practice. Nations and private enterprise are beginning to take 
  steps to reduce vulnerability, especially in new construction. However, a huge 
  amount of existing construction has taken place in an unsafe manner, in 
  dangerous locations, and has yet to prove it can withstand a major hazard. 
  <LI>a growing shift in the economic losses from property damage <EM>per 
  se</EM> to associated business disruption. This shift occurs as both developed 
  and developing societies become increasingly dependent on critical 
  infrastructure that is introducing new vulnerabilities to hazards. Today, the 
  direct costs of repairing road damage, restoring power to regional electrical 
  grids, and reinstating disrupted water supplies are often small compared with 
  the losses due to business stoppages while these repairs are being made. The 
  problem may be aggravated because these systems are interdependent and because 
  our society works unceasingly to reduce inventories in favor of "just-in-time" 
  practices. </LI></UL>
<P>These problems are particularly acute in the world’s megacities, where rapid 
population influx combines with fragile infrastructure and a lack of the 
supportive, coordinated social systems that characterize more stable nation 
states to produce unprecedented vulnerabilities. There is also a troubling 
disparity between developed and developing nations with respect to injury and 
loss of life. Fatalities are decreasing in developed countries, despite 
population growth. In developing countries, they are rising. 
<UL></UL>
<P></P><A name=targets></A>
<P><STRONG>IDNDR Targets</STRONG></P>
<P>Early on, the IDNDR Scientific and Technical Committee responsible for 
coordinating international efforts established three targets. They challenged 
each nation, in the context of its plans for sustainable development, to:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>identify hazards and assess risk, 
  <LI>develop and implement mitigation plans, and 
  <LI>implement regional warning and dissemination systems. </LI></UL>
<P></P><A name=actions></A>
<P><STRONG>U.S. Actions</STRONG></P>
<P>Over the past decade, the United States has made substantial progress with 
respect to each of these three targets. Not all has stemmed directly from the 
Decade <EM>per se</EM>; much was the culmination of actions already underway. In 
fact, it might be argued that the role of a United Nations Decade should not be 
so much the redirection of energy away from previously existing efforts but 
rather the acceleration or increased emphasis on actions and policies that 
already make sense, independently of any named "Decade". Salient achievements 
from the perspective of the SNDR include:</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Identify hazards and assess risk</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has made hazard identification 
and risk assessment the starting point for the <EM>National Mitigation 
Strategy</EM> (see below). FEMA has worked with the National Institute for 
Building Sciences to develop HAZards US (HAZUS), a GIS-based computer program to 
estimate earthquake losses. HAZUS incorporates classification systems for 
buildings and lifelines in a nationally standardized methodology. HAZUS can be 
applied at three levels of refinement, depending upon the data available and the 
application. Default data (Level 1) provide rapid impressions of the type of 
damage an earthquake might produce. By adding more definitive building 
inventories, as well as data about local geology, utilities, and transportation 
systems (Level 2), the results can be refined. Additional data and specialized 
software routines (Level 3) can be added to study specific conditions such as a 
potential dam failure or tsunami. The methodology is already being used in the 
San Francisco Bay and greater New York City areas. Several communities from the 
Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC) have created HAZUS user groups that 
bring together state emergency managers and GIS experts. FEMA is currently 
generalizing the software to incorporate hydrometeorological hazards. Training 
in the use of HAZUS is available for state and local officials. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior are together 
building corresponding risk assessment capabilities with respect to fire.</P>
<P>During the 1990's, a number of private-sector firms have developed 
proprietary software for hazard identification and risk assessment. Some of the 
models are highly detailed, involving quite specific characterization of the 
geophysical event and high-resolution models of building construction and type. 
These have been used to provide vulnerability assessments for specific events in 
specific locations, such as a repeat of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, a 
repeat of worst-case Los Angeles or New Madrid earthquakes, or worst-case 
hurricane events in New Orleans, Miami, or New York City. Several scenarios 
imply losses exceeding $100 billion for individual events, and in some cases 
approaching $250 billion. The insurance and reinsurance industries have been 
major customers for the information; because the models are proprietary and 
increasingly sophisticated, testing and evaluation have become a serious and 
contentious issue.</P>
<P>Finally, during the Decade, more than 100 experts from many institutions and 
disciplines, under the leadership of the Natural Hazard Research and 
Applications Information Center (NHRAIC) at the University of Colorado, have 
worked for more than five years to conduct a Second Research Assessment. (This 
updates the First Research Assessment, carried out more than two decades ago.) 
The assessment attempts to pull together, in one summary document, what is known 
about the evolving nature and causes of natural disasters--and, more important, 
what is not known. A summary of their findings, <EM>Disaster by Design: A 
Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States</EM>, was published by the 
Joseph Henry Press in May 1999. The overall assessment is that the causes of 
natural disasters are not geophysical, or even engineering, but rather societal. 
Furthermore, decisions with respect to natural disaster reduction cannot be made 
in isolation but must be made in a larger context of sustainable development and 
other societal goals. As the assessment’s title suggests, the authors conclude 
that while disasters cannot be avoided they can be shaped--a "choose your 
poison" option. Recognizing this helps us understand why many past mitigation 
policies (<EM>e.g.</EM>, suppressing fires, building dams and levees) have not 
eliminated hazard or vulnerability but simply exchanged a profile of many small 
disasters for fewer, more costly ones.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Develop and implement mitigation plans.</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>During the IDNDR, the United States has begun a shift in policy emphasis from 
primary reliance on emergency response and reconstruction to increasing 
pre-event efforts to mitigate the impacts of hazards. Early in the Clinton 
Administration, FEMA conducted a series of "town meetings" in each of its 
regions and developed, in cooperation with state and local emergency management 
officials and others, a <EM>National Mitigation Strategy</EM> as part of the 
IDNDR. The <EM>National Mitigation Strategy</EM> laid out five main 
elements:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>hazard identification and risk assessment 
  <LI>research application and technology transfer 
  <LI>information and data access 
  <LI>resources and incentives 
  <LI>leadership and coordination </LI></UL>
<P>As its instrument for working with state and local governments as well as 
private enterprise to achieve the ends of the <EM>National Mitigation 
Strategy</EM>, FEMA conceived and implemented Project Impact, to "help 
communities protect themselves from the devastating effects of natural disasters 
by taking actions that dramatically reduce disruption and loss." To date, the 
agency has selected cities in every state for collaborative work to demonstrate 
the potential for pre-event mitigation, founded on the following principles: (1) 
preventive actions must be decided at the local level, (2) private-sector 
participation is vital, and (3) long-term investments in prevention measures are 
essential. Through a relatively small direct investment, FEMA has leveraged 
other federal efforts and achieved a catalytic effect in local/private-sector 
action. Other communities are beginning to take corresponding actions, even 
without federal funding.</P>
<P>Similarly, USDA and DoI are working on changes in national policy with 
respect to forest fire and fuels management. As a result of all the above 
actions, the United States is well on the way to developing a significant, 
sustained national mitigation effort for the coming century.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Implement regional warning and dissemination 
systems</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Throughout the 1990's, the United States has taken steps that provide an 
extraordinary improvement in its ability to forecast and warn of coming 
hazards:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>National Weather Service (NWS) Modernization and Associated 
  Restructuring</EM>. The United States has just completed a $4 billion 
  investment in satellites, radars, surface observing networks and information 
  processing to modernize its ability to observe, forecast, and warn of 
  hydrometeorological hazards. These constitute 85% of the Presidential Disaster 
  Declarations and 67% of the property damage suffered in the United States. As 
  a result, the United States now experiences improved weather warnings and 
  forecasts on time scales ranging from tornado forecasts of a few minutes to 
  hurricane landfalls of a day or so to severe winter storm forecasts out to a 
  week or more. 
  <LI><EM>Seasonal/interannual forecasts</EM>. In addition, the United States 
  has worked with other nations to deploy and operate a global network of buoys 
  to monitor the ocean changes responsible for triggering El Niño, La Niña, and 
  related seasonal to interannual changes in the patterns of severe weather 
  worldwide. As a result, the world enjoys its earliest and best warnings to 
  date of such events. Estimates put the savings resulting from successful 
  anticipation of the 1997-1998 El Niño event in the $10 billion range. 
  <LI><EM>The effects of climate change</EM>. The United States has worked with 
  other nations to provide new insights into changes in climate conditions that 
  can be reasonably expected over periods of decades to a century. 
  <LI><EM>The Global Disaster Information Network</EM>. Through this initiative, 
  led by Vice President Gore, the United States is beginning to integrate 
  national technical means with other satellite and information processing 
  assets to provide wholly new capabilities for damage assessment and emergency 
  response. 
  <LI><EM>Volcanic ash plumes</EM>. U.S. agencies (Federal Aviation 
  Administration [FAA], National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], 
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], and U.S. Geological 
  Survey [USGS]) have instituted an operational capability for alerting aircraft 
  to the presence of volcanic ash plumes. Geosynchronous and polar-orbiting 
  satellites observe plumes injected into the stratosphere by volcanic 
  explosions, and nine volcanic ash advisory centers, including two in the 
  United States, issue real-time warnings around the globe. In addition to 
  continuous surveillance of the volcanoes themselves and their associated ash 
  clouds, the agencies have modified air traffic control procedures and pilot 
  training. </LI></UL>
<P><STRONG><EM>Other U.S. Progress</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>In other developments closely paralleling the work described above in weather 
and climate, the United States has made positive strides in natural disaster 
reduction during the Decade.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)</EM>. FEMA, the 
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science 
  Foundation (NSF), and USGS lead a coordinated effort to reduce the threat of 
  earthquakes in hazardous areas. These vulnerable areas are indicated on 
  recently-released groundshaking maps for the Nation. 
  <LI><EM>Forest Fire</EM>. USDA and DoI have developed new suites of products 
  for estimating fuel loading and for fire prediction. They work with other 
  federal agencies and state and local entities to reduce the forest fire 
  threat. Significant new resources are now available for controlled burns to 
  reduce the fuel buildup in the United States and therefore the threat of major 
  fire. 
  <LI><EM>Tsunamis</EM>. During the IDNDR, NOAA has led an effort with FEMA, the 
  USGS, and the five Pacific states (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and 
  Washington) to mitigate the tsunami threat. The program provides for hazard 
  identification and risk assessment, state and local mitigation planning, and 
  improvements in tsunami warning. 
  <LI><EM>Space Weather</EM>. In a similar way, several federal agencies (NOAA, 
  U.S. Air Force, USGS, NASA, and NSF) have collaborated to reduce greatly the 
  threat to spacecraft, electrical utilities, global telecommunications, and 
  other sectors posed by space weather. Through x-ray imaging of the sun, 
  instrumenting the L1 site between the earth and sun to detect solar flares, 
  and other measures, the United States has increased warning times and reduced 
  false alarm rates. </LI></UL>
<P><STRONG><EM>Partnerships with the Private Sector</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>The federal government has made great strides during the decade to improve 
its ability to partner with the private sector. By far the most important 
example has been Project Impact, described above. Additionally, the SNDR has 
worked with the property and casualty insurers and reinsurers through the 
Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) to establish the Public Private 
Partnership 2000. Over the past eighteen months, the Partnership has sponsored 
13 day-long forums. Each has focused on a major problem of joint public-private 
concern, and each has provided an opportunity for lively discussion and new 
partnerships to resolve these issues. The response has been overwhelmingly 
positive.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>International Collaborations</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>The United States has also worked bilaterally and multilaterally with other 
governments to reduce natural disasters. Following the Kobe earthquake, under 
the Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective, the United States and 
Japan began a series of Earthquake Policy Symposiums and Forums. These meetings 
enable participants to share and develop common insights into earthquake 
research, disaster prevention, emergency response, and long- term recovery and 
reconstruction. The United States and China conducted a bilateral natural 
disaster reduction workshop in November 1997 and initiated a number of follow-up 
measures. The United States and China continued their successful research 
collaboration under the US/PRC Protocol for Scientific and Cooperative Research 
on Earthquake Studies, Earthquake Engineering, and Hazard Mitigation. The United 
States and Indonesia cooperate with respect to forest fire management and 
related research. These are but a few examples in an extensive list.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>General Level of U.S. Effort</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Roughly speaking, the U.S. Government allocates a few billion dollars each 
year to the ongoing costs of maintaining an emergency response capability and 
providing for recovery from disasters. The U.S. Government spends another few 
billion each year on unbudgeted emergency response and recovery activities 
triggered by individual disasters, although the figures vary widely from year to 
year. Budgeted Federal expenditures for pre-event mitigation amount to perhaps 
10% of these total figures, in excess of $500 million per year. In recent years, 
federal investments in pre-event mitigation measures are rising significantly. 
In the 1999 budget, increases totaled $100 million. The 2000 budget requests 
another $136M increase for such activities.</P><A name=future></A>
<P><STRONG>Outlook for the Future</STRONG></P>
<P>Rather than attempt an exhaustive catalog of work underway or contemplated, 
this section presents a qualitative assessment of needed future work, noting the 
general degree of difficulty associated with each task.</P>
<P>Success is challenging, but nonetheless likely, with respect to:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Warning and emergency response</EM>. Investments made by the United 
  States and other nations have resulted in improved forecasts of 
  hydrometeorological and some geophysical events and rapid assessments of their 
  impacts. These improvements are likely to continue over the next few decades. 
  Furthermore, because of the investments in information infrastructure, the 
  emergency response environment is likely to be transformed from one that is 
  currently information-poor to one that will be increasingly information-rich. 
  <LI><EM>Insurance and other mechanisms for spreading risk/loss</EM>. Alarm 
  over the likely size and scope of impending natural disasters has prompted 
  insurers to take action on a broad range of fronts. They are actively creating 
  new mechanisms such as catastrophe bonds for securitizing risk. They are 
  seeking Congressional relief from taxation of contingency reserves, and 
  seeking to formalize government’s role as a reinsurer of last resort. The 
  Administration is considering whether and how to provide for federal 
  intervention in reinsurance markets for natural disasters, while adhering to 
  common-sense principles that any such intrusions should not displace private 
  initiative or impose a cost on taxpayers. 
  <LI><EM>Access to information</EM>. Information is now much more accessible, 
  not only on mitigation measures in general but also on best practice. Taken 
  together, Project Impact and investments in information infrastructure promise 
  greater future availability of information on pre-event disaster mitigation 
  practices at the local community and free enterprise level, where it is most 
  needed.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Success is possible, but more problematic, with respect to:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Public awareness</EM>. Media attention of the past few years has 
  heightened public interest in and awareness of natural disasters. The question 
  is whether and how this enhanced media coverage will translate into greater 
  public support for pre-event mitigation measures in the face of competing 
  demands for attention and for resources. 
  <LI><EM>Sustained, meaningful implementation of pre-event mitigation measures 
  and their concomitant financing</EM>. Again, a broad range of pre-event 
  mitigation measures are demonstrably effective, but the financing of such 
  measures, and steps by government and industry (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the financial 
  sector) to provide incentives, may prove more difficult to implement in 
  practice. 
  <LI><EM>International cooperation</EM>. The fall 1998 Atlantic hurricane 
  season, and Hurricanes Georges and Mitch in particular, drove home the point 
  that current international efforts to mitigate natural disasters, and to 
  incorporate disaster risk in international investment, remain far below what 
  is desirable. In this case, for example, dramatic decreases in loss of life 
  for U.S. hurricanes reflects improved forecasting capability plus 
  communications plus planning. This same level of attention and support is 
  needed internationally.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Success is unlikely without new national and international emphasis with 
respect to:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Newly emerging hazards</EM>. These include but are not limited to the 
  technological hazards resulting from otherwise natural extreme events, and 
  other, closely related hazards such as terrorism, particularly with respect to 
  the use of chemical, biological, and nuclear agents of mass destruction. 
  <LI><EM>Vulnerability of critical infrastructure to natural hazards</EM>. Not 
  enough is known about the performance of particular structures such as 
  buildings, bridges, power generating plants, water treatment plants, and the 
  like with respect to a variety of natural threats. Far less is known, however, 
  about the performance of these infrastructures as a whole with respect to 
  natural extremes. For example, no individual roadway was directly lost to the 
  Florida forest fires of this past year, but it was necessary to shut down 
  Interstate 95 with a resulting disruption of Florida commerce and tourism. 
  Many homes were lost, but many more could not be occupied because of the 
  disruption in access and critical support services. The effects of the January 
  1998 ice storm on the electrical networks of the northeastern United States 
  and eastern Canada were largely unanticipated. New vulnerabilities associated 
  with cyber infrastructure, and particularly with regard to the increasing 
  control of other infrastructures such as communications, electricity, gas, 
  water, sewage, and transportation by cyber infrastructure, remain uncharted 
  and potentially threatening to an unprecedented degree. If nothing else, such 
  technological change transforms the nature of economic loss from actual 
  property damage to economic disruption. 
  <LI><EM>Megacities</EM>. Simply put, megacities can be viewed as "job shops" 
  competing for global business and jobs. Like all job shops, they must attempt 
  to keep wages and overheads low. At the urban level, this implies 
  overcrowding, inattention to environmental protection, fewer resources and 
  more responsibilities, greater fragility of infrastructure even in the absence 
  of hazards, and greater recovery problems following disasters. 
  <LI><EM>Equity issues</EM>. To the extent that most natural disasters are 
  indeed social in origin, it also follows, as experts agree, that their burden 
  falls disproportionately on those already most economically disadvantaged. 
  This is true both on an international level, where developing countries face 
  greater risk than their developed counterparts, and domestically. The poor 
  within each society are forced to live in substandard structures, on more 
  dangerous land, and have fewer resources to lessen their own risk and 
  vulnerability. Just as these issues remain at the heart of the overall 
  sustainable development challenge, they are at the root of efforts to reduce 
  natural disasters.</LI></UL>
<P></P><A name=behind></A>
<P><STRONG>Is Science Falling Behind?</STRONG></P>
<P>Because natural disasters have their roots in societal causes, and today’s 
rates of population increase, economic growth, and technological advance are 
rapid and unprecedented, disasters are evolving rapidly in response. Scientific 
understanding and engineering practice may not be keeping up. Furthermore, 
ecosystem management and the application of scientific knowledge and best 
practice engineering are lagging. Some examples of problem areas include:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>The science of loss estimation per se</EM>. The National Academy of 
  Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) has recently called attention to 
  this issue. We lack standard accounting procedures, which can be applied 
  uniformly from hazard to hazard, for estimating economic losses from 
  disasters. Estimating future losses is even more problematic. 
  <LI><EM>Social analysis.</EM> We lack the ability to explain in a systematic 
  way why new scientific and technological advances are not being used 
  effectively to mitigate disasters. The just-completed Second Assessment 
  provides background and a broad range of recommendations in this area. 
  <LI><EM>Many geophysical hazards remain resolutely unpredictable</EM>. This is 
  particularly true of solid-earth hazards (with the exception of volcanic 
  eruptions). Reliable earthquake prediction has not been achieved; however, 
  pilot systems to rapidly quantify the earthquake shaking after the event, and 
  to give a few seconds’ warning before the shaking begins, are under 
  development. Even hydrometeorological hazards are not forecastable on the 
  extended time scales required by today’s society, which must therefore 
  continue to rely on rudimentary maps of hazard zonation and climatologies. For 
  example, although hurricane forecasts are much improved over former years, 
  they have not kept pace with the rise in evacuation clearance times along much 
  of the U.S. coast, occasioned by population increase in coastal counties. 
  Specialized applications, such as evacuation of ships from Charleston and 
  Norfolk in advance of hurricane arrival, and Cape Kennedy Space Shuttle 
  launches in support of the Space Station, now require decisions as much as 120 
  hours in advance of landfall, well outside the range of reliable hurricane 
  forecast skill. 
  <LI><EM>The effects of global change on hazards remains obscure</EM>. What 
  will be the impact of such long-term trends on the intensity, frequency of 
  occurrence, and location of extreme events? 
  <LI><EM>The pace of engineering advance and its implementation in 
  practice</EM>. Sometimes needed advances are implemented too slowly; the 
  failure to adopt building codes based on the best current science is a prime 
  example. On the other hand, some advances, like the use of welded steel moment 
  frames for high-rise buildings, are implemented relatively rapidly, on a very 
  broad scale, before their vulnerabilities to hazards (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the weld 
  cracks discovered following the Northridge earthquake) fully surface. 
  <LI><EM>Ecosystems</EM>. The interaction of wild and managed ecosystems with 
  extreme events and their changed vulnerability as a result of human 
  interference remain largely uninvestigated and unknown. Some ecosystems 
  actually require extreme events for their health. 
  <LI><EM>Critical Infrastructure</EM>. The performance and vulnerability of 
  critical infrastructures on a systems level--communications, electricity, 
  financial, gas, sewage, transportation, and water--to natural hazards also 
  remain poorly understood. Increasingly, all these systems are coming under 
  common computer control with unknown implications for disaster vulnerability.

<P>Furthermore, the interaction of these threats with technological hazards and 
with willful threats such as terrorism remains unknown and unassessed. All these 
realities speak to the importance of continued, multidisciplinary scientific and 
engineering attention to natural disaster reduction in the decades ahead.</P>
<P>Improved science must be accompanied by other efforts. We need sustained, 
committed emphasis on mitigation planning and implementation, and expanded 
partnerships between the public and private sector. To fulfill the promise of 
the IDNDR, we must continue working to make natural disaster reduction a public 
value in the United States and around the world.</P>
