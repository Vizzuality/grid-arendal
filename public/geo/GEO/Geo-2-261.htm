          <TD colSpan=2 vAlign=top width=600>The National Assessment of the 
            Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change is a 
            landmark in the major ongoing effort to understand what climate 
            change means for the United States. The Assessment was called for by 
            a 1990 law, and has been conducted under the <A 
            href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">US Global Change Research Program</A> 
            in response to a request from the President&#8217;s Science Advisor. This 
            site contains the final approved version of the report of the 
            National Assessment Synthesis Team, which was a federal advisory 
            committee made up of experts drawn from government, universities, 
            industry, and non-governmental organizations. The report is provided 
            in two parts: (1) an Overview report, and (2) a Foundation report 
            that provides additional detail and full references. These two 
            national-level, peer-reviewed documents synthesize results from 
            studies conducted by regional and sector teams, and from the broader 
            scientific literature. More information on the National Assessment 
            and how it was conducted is available at <A 
            href="http://www.nacc.usgcrp.gov/">http://www.nacc.usgcrp.gov/</A>. 
            <P>The files provided are PDF files that can be viewed using Adobe 
            Acrobat Reader. We realize the files are quite large, in large part 
            because they include color graphics. For the benefit of those 
            wanting a printed copy of the report, published copies of the 
            Overview report should become available in late November, and of the 
            Foundation report in December. <A
