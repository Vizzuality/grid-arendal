      <P><B><BIG>Final Paper - Executive Summary</BIG></B><BR>November 2000</P>
      <P>The Pak Mun report is one of 8 case studies undertaken world-wide with 
      a common methodology and approach that sought to inform the Commission on 
      the performance and the development effectiveness of large dams.&nbsp; 
      This case study concerns the Pak Mun Hydropower project, a 
      run-of-the-river dam located near the confluence of the Mun and the Mekong 
      River in the Northeast region of Thailand.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The report attempts to compare the planned intended outcomes and the 
      actual results. The case study would provide an analysis of the 
      performance and the manner in which decision-making processes have 
      responded to an evolving social, economic and political context since 
      project completion. The lessons learned from the planning and 
      decision-making process will directly inform the Commission's findings and 
      recommendations. Six central questions have been identified that are key 
      to the World Commission on Dams (WCD) work programme and methodology. 
      These questions serve to structure the information collection, discussion 
      and assessment of the topics of performance and development effectiveness. 
      The Pak Mun case study sought to address these questions:</P>
      <OL type=1>
        <LI>What were the projected vs actual benefits, costs and impacts? 
        <LI>What were the unexpected benefits, costs and impacts? 
        <LI>What was the distribution of costs and benefits, who gained and who 
        lost? 
        <LI>How were decisions made? 
        <LI>Did the project comply with the criteria and guidelines of the day? 
        <LI>How would this project be viewed in today's context?</LI></OL>
      <P>The case study has primarily used existing data sources and reports to 
      inform its assessment. Some additional research in selected areas has been 
      undertaken. Assessing development effectiveness entails taking account of 
      the views and perspectives of different stakeholders and project-affected 
      groups. As an integral part of the methodology, in parallel to the study 
      process, two consultation meetings were included. These meetings were 
      intended to ensure that the views of different interest groups could be 
      considered by the study team, and provided opportunities for comments and 
      input.</P>
      <H3>The Pak Mun Project: Description</H3>
      <P>The Pak Mun Dam is built on the Mun River, 5.5km upstream from its 
      confluence with the Mekong, in the province of Ubon Ratchathani, in 
      Northeast Thailand. The dam is typed as roller compacted concrete with a 
      maximum height of 17m and total length of 300. The reservoir has a surface 
      area of 60 square km at normal high water level of 108 metres above the 
      mean sea level (MSL) and a capacity of 225 million cubic metres. The 
      Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) built and operates the 
      dam as a run-of-the-river hydropower plant. Its operating rules are 
      designed to ensure that the water level does not rise above 106mMSL during 
      the dry season, from January to May and retains a maximum level of 108m 
      MSL for the rest of the year. The storage capacity of the dam's reservoir 
      is essentially that of the pre-existing river channel.</P>
      <P>When the Environmental Impact Studies conducted in 1982 indicated that 
      approximately 4 000 households would be displaced if the reservoir was 
      impounded to a level of 113 MSL. Therefore an alternative design with a 
      normal water level of 108 MSL was agreed upon in 1985. The relocation of 
      the dam site significantly minimised the extent of displacement to an 
      estimated 248 households. The original project design was further modified 
      by relocating the dam 1.5km upstream to avoid the submergence of Kaeng 
      Tana rapids, an important environmental and tourist site. EGAT also 
      decided to lower the reservoir to 106 MSL during dry season from January 
      to May and to adjust the dam's operating regime to uncover the upstream 
      Kaeng Saphue rapids. However a new environmental impact assessment (EIA) 
      which may have identified and anticipated some of the new environmental 
      impacts arising from the new location was not conducted at this 
      stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>What were the predicted versus actual benefits, costs, and 
      impacts?</H3>
      <H4>Cost of the project</H4>
      <P>In May 1989 the Cabinet approved the 17m high, 136 mega watt (MW) Pak 
      Mun project with a budget of 3.88 billion Baht (US$ 155.2 million). In 
      1991 National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) approved the 
      modified project cost of 6.6 billion Baht (US$ 264 million). The final 
      cost tally by EGAT in 1999 was 6.507 billion Baht (US$ 260 million). In 
      nominal terms the project costs increased by 68% from the original 
      estimates between 1989-99. Not including taxes and interests during 
      construction the cost overruns in nominal terms are 91% over original 
      estimates in 1988.&nbsp; However, the analysis indicates that in real 
      terms (calculated at constant 1998 prices) the cost overun was 
      considerably less.</P>
      <P>Compensation and Resettlement costs increased from 231.55 million Baht 
      (US$ 9.26 million) in EGAT's 1988 estimates to an actual expenditure of 1 
      113.1 million Baht (US$ 44.24 million)&nbsp; till 1999. In real terms 
      resettlement costs increased by 182%. Compensation for loss in fisheries, 
      which was unanticipated in the original estimate, accounted for 395.6 
      million Baht by April 1999 (US$ 15.8 million).&nbsp;</P>
      <H4>Benefits - Hydropower</H4>
      <P>Pak Mun dam is located at the end of a large watershed where rainfall 
      and run off vary considerably between dry and wet seasons. During wet 
      months Pak Mun can turbine the daily inflow to serve the 4 hour peak 
      demand and in addition can generate power in off-peak hours with surplus 
      water available. However during the dry months the plant cannot produce 
      its full rated capacity for the 4 hour peak demand due to insufficient 
      water.</P>
      <P>The output of the plant depends on the water level in the reservoir and 
      the tailwater level. The Pak Mun Dam's power production peaks in the wet 
      season when it is least needed in the power system and is lowest in the 
      dry season when it is most needed. When the water levels in the Mekong 
      river are very high, the power plant will be shutdown for lack of 
      generating head.</P>
      <P>The operation records from the commissioning of the plant in 1994 
      indicate that Pak Mun's average annual output has been 290 Giga Watt per 
      hour&nbsp; (GWh). This compares with the estimated average of 280 GWh. Pak 
      Mun dam featured as a 136 MW, run-of-the-river project, to serve peaking 
      needs in EGAT's presentation to the Cabinet as well as World Bank 
      documents. However following the rules based on the daily power output 
      data betweeen 1995-99, Pak Mun plant can use only 15% of its capacity as 
      reliable 4 hour peak capacity. The actual dependable capacity of Pak Mun 
      project calculated from daily power output between 1995-98 assuming that 
      all available power gets assigned to a 4 hour peak demand period is only 
      20.81 MW. This 21 MW is what the Pak Mun project offsets in gas turbine 
      capacity. However the value of alternative generating capacity adopted for 
      comparative purposes by EGAT and sanctioned by the World Bank was much 
      higher at 150 MW.</P>
      <P>The actual operation of Pak Mun is often different from what was 
      assumed in the planning studies. This type of operation may be beneficial 
      from an ancillary services point of view (such as frequency and voltage 
      regulation, Var control etc.), but the energy benefits will be less than 
      planned.</P>
      <P>Recalculating the project's equalising discount rate assuming that one 
      would need one 21 MW gas turbine to provide the dependable capacity of a 
      20.8 MW hydro plant, the current report reaches a value of 7.88% which is 
      below the shadow cost of capital in Thailand.&nbsp; When the benefits of 
      the ancillary electricity net support of the dam and the green house 
      gasses reduction benefit of the dam were included in the evaluation of the 
      dam, these benefits were not sufficient to make the project economically 
      justifiable.</P>
      <P>EGAT and the World Bank indicated their disagreement with the finding. 
      They explained that they looked at the overall power system at the 
      planning stage. In the context of the whole system, it is possible that 
      there would be enough (hydro) storage energy in the system to be able to 
      cope with a dry year dry season output of Pak Mun. In the dry season, Pak 
      Mun would be able to produce 136 MW over a number of hours, and that is 
      enough to increase the output or start a thermal plant. It may not do that 
      over an extended period, but that may not necessary. In that case the full 
      136 MW could be used for the capacity benefit.</P>
      <H4>Benefits - Irrigation</H4>
      <P>The Pak Mun project was presented for review to the NESDB in 1988 and 
      to the Cabinet of Ministers in 1989 as a multi-purpose development 
      project. External financing for the project was secured through the World 
      Bank's Third Power Project in 1991, which besides hydropower and 
      irrigation, identified fisheries as a major benefit. Irrigation benefits 
      were not included in the economic analysis justifying the project by the 
      World Bank in its 1991 Staff Approval Report.The irrigation benefits of a 
      run of river project were doubtful and this was known at the time the 
      irrigation benefits were quantified in EGAT's project document.&nbsp;</P>
      <H4>Benefits - Fisheries</H4>
      <P>About 7% of the project benefits were attributed to Fisheries in EGAT's 
      1988 Project documents.</P>
      <P>The 1981 EIA predicted that fish production from the reservoir would 
      increase considerably, though some fish species may be affected by the 
      blockage of river flows by the dam. The fish yield expected from the 60 
      square km Pak Mun reservoir was 100 kg/ha/year without fish stocking and 
      220 kg/ha/year with the fish-stocking programme. However, run-of-the-river 
      reservoirs cannot sustain such high yields, as they do not provide the 
      appropriate habitat for pelagic fish species. In Thailand even storage 
      reservoirs that perform better under fish stocking programmes have a fish 
      yield of about 19 to 38 kg/ha/year. The predicted fish yield from Pak Mun 
      head pond was too high. A more realistic estimate would have been around 
      10 kg/ha/year.&nbsp; There has been no evidence to indicate that the fish 
      productivity of Pak Mun reservoir has reached anywhere near the 
      anticipated 100 kg/ha/year.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The 1981 EIA valued the total annual predicted fish catch in the head 
      pond at US$ 320 000 at the rate of 20 Baht per kg, without stocking. With 
      stocking program the predicted catch would be worth US$ 693 000 at the 
      rate of 20 Baht per kg. The 1981 EIA underestimated the total value of 
      fishing yields that could be obtained from the free-flowing river. After 
      the completion of Pak Mun dam, the lower Mun River experienced a decline 
      in fishing yields with an estimated value of US$ 1.4 million per annum at 
      20 Baht/kg. In addition to this the decline in fish species upstream led 
      to the closure of 70 Tum Pla Yon traps. At the price of 18 Baht/kg at the 
      end of 1980s, the value of annual catch from these traps is calculated at 
      US$ 212 000 per annum (1 US$ = 38 Baht). EGAT and the World Bank&nbsp; 
      expressed their disagreement with the study team's findings. A detailed 
      basis for the conclusion is presented in the annex related to EGAT's 
      comments.</P>
      <H3>Impacts</H3>
      <P>The 1982-83 Environmental Planning Survey predicted 241 households as 
      displaced people. The actual number of households displaced by Pak Mun dam 
      was 1,700. Unpredicted by the EIA, a large number of households were 
      adversely affected due to declining fishing yields. Until March 2000, 
      6,202 households were compensated for loss in fisheries during the 3-year 
      construction period. Compensation for the permanent loss of fisheries has 
      not been given.</P>
      <H4><I>What were the unexpected impacts, if any?</I></H4>
      <H4>Impact on Fish Migration &amp; Fish diversity</H4>
      <P>Of the 265 fish species recorded in the Mun-Chi watershed before 1994, 
      77 species were migratory and 35 species are dependent on habitat 
      associated with rapids.<A 
      href="http://www.dams.org/studies/th/th_exec.htm#_edn3" name=_ednref3 
      title=""><SUP>[3]</SUP></A>&nbsp; Available evidence does not indicate 
      disappearance of any species before 1990, and nearly all species are very 
      common ones to the region. Out of 265 species, about 10 were introduced 
      species.</P>
      <P>The decline has been higher in the upstream region. The latest survey 
      recorded 96 species in the upstream region. Out of 169 species not found 
      in the present catch, 51 species have been caught less significantly since 
      the completion of the project. At least another 50 species of rapid 
      dependent fish have disappeared, and many species declined significantly. 
      Migratory and rapid dependent species were affected seriously as their 
      migration route is blocked in the beginning of the rainy season, the head 
      pond has inundated their spawning ground and the fish pass is not 
      performing. Long-term studies are required to arrive at a firmer 
      conclusion on the exact number of species that disappeared from Chi - Mun 
      river basin after the construction of Pak Mun dam. The fish catch directly 
      upstream of the dam has declined by 60-80% after the completion of the 
      project.</P>
      <P>There are divergent views on the extent that the decline in fish 
      species could be attributed soley to the dam with the view being proposed 
      that the reduction in fish species might have started prior to the 
      study.</P>
      <P>The Pak Mun case study concludes that the difference in number of 
      species in fish surveys before and after dam construction may well be 
      exacerbated by the cumulative impact of many different developments in the 
      watershed. These include: water resources and hydropower development in 
      Chi-Mun river watershed, deforestation, domestic waste water discharge, 
      agriculture intensification and development, fisheries, industrial waste 
      water discharge, saline soils and enforcement of water quality standards 
      and classification. All these developments have contributed to a decline 
      in fish species in the Mun/Chi watershed as a whole. The Pak Mun Dam 
      cannot be blamed for the apparent disappearance of all these fish species. 
      Cumulative impacts of all developments including the Pak Mun Dam have led 
      to disappearance of fish species. Downstream of the Pak Mun project, one 
      or two species of fish have completely disappeared from the catch after 
      the dam construction.</P>
      <P>Location of the dam on the Mun river 5.5 km upstream from its 
      confluence with the Mekong has affected several migrating and 
      rapid-dependent fish species. Thus, decline in and disappearance of 
      several migrating and rapid-dependent fish species are directly 
      attributable to the Pak Mun dam.</P>
      <H4>Performance of Fish Pass</H4>
      <P>The project provided several mitigation measures, including a fish 
      ladder to facilitate fish migration. Provision of a fish ladder was based 
      on very little knowledge and experience. This mitigation plan came out at 
      the time the dam construction was almost completed; and even then this 
      important plan was not well prepared.</P>
      <P>The 1981 EIA did not consider the construction of a fish ladder 
      necessary for the Pak Mun dam but recommended the feasibility study of a 
      fish way. The plan for a fish pass came at a time when dam construction 
      was almost completed. In effect, the fish pass was constructed after the 
      completion of the dam at the cost of 2 million Baht (US$ 0.08 million). 
      The fish pass has not been performing and is not allowing upstream fish 
      migration. The project authorities have discontinued monitoring of the 
      fish pass.</P>
      <P>A vertical slot fish pass or a Denil fish pass instead of a pool and 
      weir fish pass may have been more effective.</P>
      <H4>Reservoir Stocking as Mitigation</H4>
      <P>Reservoir fishery was developed by EGAT in response to claims of 
      declining fish catch. Total cost of stocking the head pond with fresh 
      water Prawn (<I>Macrobrachium rosenbergi</I>) ranged between US$ 31 920 
      and US$ 44 240 annually between 1995-98. The Department of Fisheries 
      estimates the total annual revenue of fishing yield to range between 1.2 
      to 3.2 million Baht. However the estimated annual catch and revenue for 
      fishermen are too high. The Department of Fisheries in their revenue 
      estimate included the naturally occurring Macrobrachium species that can 
      breed in fresh water. The M. rosenbergi spawns in salt water and migrates 
      to fresh water and therefore cannot establish a population under reservoir 
      conditions. For this reason it may well turn out that the stocking of M. 
      Rosenbergi in Pak Mun head pond is not generating any income for the 
      fishermen. The project has discontinued fish and prawn stocking.</P>
      <H4>Impact on Livelihood</H4>
      <P>In the post-dam period fishing communities located upstream and 
      downstream of the dam reported 50-100% decline in fish catch and the 
      disappearance of many fish species. The number households dependent on 
      fisheries in the upstream region declined from 95.6% to 66.7%. Villagers 
      who were dependent on fisheries for cash income have found no viable means 
      of livelihood since the dam was built, despite efforts to provide training 
      opportunities. As their food security and incomes destabilised they sought 
      various ways to cope including out migration to urban areas in search of 
      wage labour.</P>
      <P>Some households had to settle in forest reserve areas or on other 
      common property as the compensation money was insufficient to buy 
      alternate land. The Thai economic crisis affected households that did not 
      use the compensation money to buy productive assets. Cropping incomes have 
      declined and there has been a reduction in livestock as people are selling 
      both due to a shift from farm based occupations as well as reduced grazing 
      land.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Next to fisheries, loss of access to common property such as forest and 
      grazing land has been among the other adverse impacts. Forests and 
      riverbank dry season gardens were not compensated.</P>
      <P>Since the completion of the project several committees were set up to 
      assess the number and extent of households affected by loss of fisheries 
      income. In all, over 6 202 fishermen demonstrated to the committee that 
      they were engaged in fishing and their income affected following 
      construction and operation of Pak Mun dam.</P>
      <P>Based on the committee's findings, EGAT paid 90 000 Baht to each of the 
      3 955 fishermen in 1995, and it approved payment of 60 000 Baht each to 
      another 2 200 fishermen in March 2000. Still, a large number of households 
      located upstream of the dam are still waiting to be recognised for 
      compensation. Unexpected costs of the project included the compensation 
      for fisheries (488.5 million Baht had been paid up to March 2000) and 
      investment on fish and prawn stocking programme<I>.</I> Till March 2000, 
      488.5 million Baht (US$ 19.5 million) had been paid as compensation for 
      loss of fisheries livelihood.</P>
      <P>While the government acknowledged the impact on fisheries and agreed to 
      compensate eligible households at the rate of 90 000 Baht as compensation 
      for loss of income during the three-year construction period, mitigation 
      for the long-term loss of fisheries livelihood is under negotiation. On 
      January 25, 1997, the villagers from Pak Mun joined the 99-day protest in 
      Bangkok demanding fair compensations for the permanent loss of their 
      fishing livelihood. Land and cash compensation promised by the government 
      in April 1997 was retracted under a new political regime in 1998. From 
      March 1999 villagers began demonstrations to be compensated by the 
      Government and the World Bank for permanent loss of income from 
      fisheries.</P>
      <H4>Decision Making and Conflict</H4>
      <P>Assessment of project impacts, like the assessment practices in past 
      dam projects, remained focused on inundated areas and resettlement issues. 
      Pak Mun project happened to be the first run-off-river type dam, with no 
      reservoir and thus impacts due to flood and resettlement were not assumed 
      to be as serious as those of other big dam projects in the region. Thus, 
      fisheries impacts were overlooked. No study ever predicted that fisheries 
      issues would become problematic, during construction or implementation 
      though this issue was raised with the World Bank as early as October 1991 
      and prior to that with EGAT.</P>
      <P>It has been realised by almost all of the stakeholders that planning, 
      decision making, implementation and mitigation were done with inadequate 
      base-line information, especially on fisheries, the most serious and most 
      controversial of the issues. The project authorities considered that it 
      was not possible to determine the number of fishermen actually affected or 
      the extent of loss suffered and there was a perception of exaggerated and 
      ever-increasing claims for compensation. ? The absence of a proper 
      baseline meant that claims for compensation by a large number of families 
      would not be considered legitimate which meant that the only possible 
      recourse for the affected villagers was prolonged protest.</P>
      <P>Thus, the Pak Mun project becamemired in a protracted process of 
      conflict between the adversely-affected villagers, the project developers 
      and the Government. Exclusion of affected people from the decision-making 
      process gave rise toprotracted protests, demonstrations and 
      confrontations. These actions were taken in order to seek recognition and 
      settlement of compensation and rehabilitation entitlements. This resulted 
      in very strong negative perception within the community for the 
      project.</P>
      <H4>Impact on Rapids</H4>
      <P>The height of the dam was reduced and its location changed from the 
      initial plan to drastically reduce resettlement of persons and to preserve 
      the Kaeng Tana and Kaeng Saphue rapids that are tourist attractions. This 
      was done at a substantial sacrifice in power benefits.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
      more than 50 natural rapids were permanently submerged by the project. 
      These rapids served as the habitat of a number of species of fish, and 
      thereforeseveral rapid-dependent fish species seem to have disappeared. 
      The implication of the loss of rapids for fisheries was not assessed in 
      the project's environmental impact study.</P>
      <H4>Other Environmental impacts</H4>
      <P>The project has resulted in the loss of riverbank vegetation, natural 
      forest and community forest. In the pre-project period, the women in the 
      community harvested 40 edible plants, 10 bamboo species and 45 mushroom 
      species for household subsistence and small income. A number of medicinal 
      plants were also found near the Mun riverbank. Loss of these plants and 
      vegetation through inundation has implications for biodiversity and 
      household food security. These aspects were overlooked in the environment 
      assessment study in 1982 and in the absence of a new EIA for the 
      redesigned project.&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>What was the distribution of costs and benefits: who gained and who 
      lost?</H3>
      <P>Pak Mun project was a part of EGAT's least cost development plan to 
      serve the peaking needs of Northeast Thailand. However as the project 
      cannot function as a reliable peaking plant of 136 MW due to a number of 
      constraints; the nature and extent of gain to Thailand's Northeast region 
      from the power contribution of the Pak Mun project remains a matter of 
      diverging opinion. The changing mix of technologies for generation since 
      1988, indicates that hydropower is gradually playing a less important role 
      in power provision. From the data on contribution of different power 
      generation to the seasonal peak load, it can be seen that hydropower 
      contributes significantly during the hottest and driest months in 
      Thailand. These are also the months when the Pak Mun hydropower plant is 
      least able to have the water resources to contribute because it has no 
      storage reservoir.</P>
      <P>Communities dependent on the fisheries for livelihood in the upstream 
      and downstream of the Mun River experienced an ongoing decline in fish 
      catch. The Royal Thai Government had to recognise and pay compensation to 
      6 202 fishermen for the unanticipated loss in fisheries income. While 
      compensation settlement has been reached with over 6 202 households 
      regarding loss in income during the three years of construction, 
      compensation for permanent losses in livelihood remains under 
      negotiation.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Despite the cash and credit compensation, permanent loss of fisheries 
      cannot be replaced by a one-off cash compensation. As a result of the 
      project and in the absence of baseline information, the Thai Government is 
      left vulnerable to ever-increasing claims for compensation for the loss of 
      fisheries livelihood.&nbsp; Regarding the issue of fisheries, all 
      stakeholders stand to lose, not only from a disrupted ecosystem but also 
      from increased expenditure on mitigation efforts that are unlikely to 
      mitigate the losses.</P>
      <P>Villagers who owned some land on slightly higher elevations were able 
      to grow some rice prior to the dam construction. Villagers who were 
      dependent largely on fisheries for cash income, however, have found no 
      viable means of living since the depletion of fish in the reservoir. The 
      changes were particularly acute in paddy production.&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the 
      Mun River, swamps and wetland forests, are parts of the riverine 
      ecosystem.&nbsp; During the rainy seasons, these are flooding areas and 
      places for fish to spawn.&nbsp; In the past, villagers used the area along 
      the river to find bamboo shoots, mushrooms, native plants and vegetables 
      that they depend on for their subsistence. During the dry seasons, they 
      also developed narrow patches of land along the riverbanks for growing 
      vegetables.&nbsp; In the upper part of the lower Mun, where banks were not 
      steep, land along the river was developed as paddy fields. These have 
      brought drastic changes in the way that villagers use natural 
      resources.&nbsp; As their food and income security has been destabilized, 
      villagers have sought different ways to cope with the changing conditions. 
      Some of them and their children began to leave their villages to look for 
      alternative employment opportunities, such as working in construction or 
      in factories. Compensation was not invested in productive assets. Many 
      affected people who were given compensation used the money to build their 
      new house or change their roof. Many also have debts, borrowing from their 
      cooperative as well as local moneylenders. Short-term wage opportunities 
      and one-off cash compensation cannot replace the loss of a productive 
      resource base by the community.</P>
      <P>After resettlement, villagers have witnessed many social and cultural 
      problems. The new social arrangements have disrupted former social 
      relations and changed patterns of interaction among the villagers. In the 
      pastthe Mun river served as the stage for their social life.&nbsp; The 
      river was where villagers met, interacted, and developed social networks 
      of exchange. The traditional communal ceremony had usually been organized 
      on the riverbank, but now could not be held due to the submergence of the 
      ceremonial site and, in part, due to the social disintegration of the 
      communities. Since the beginning of the Pak Mun project conflicts of ideas 
      and interests arose between those who opposed the dam and the kamnan and 
      headmen group. The conflict was intensified during protests and 
      demonstrations for compensation. Those who were opposing the dam were 
      often discriminated against. The conflict over the dam project at the 
      local level created mistrust and deep social rifts.</P>
      <P>The local community and adversely-affected villagers have expended 
      considerable time and effort over nearly ten years in protests, 
      demonstrations and negotiations with the government and project 
      authorities. What became an issue of lost livelihood and a conflict over 
      compensation was initially a demand for a role in the decisionmaking 
      processes pertaining to the development, utilisation and transformation of 
      natural resources that form the livelihood base of the community. The 
      process has created bitterness and negative perceptions withinthe 
      community at being excluded from critical stages in the decision-making 
      process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The World Bank and EGAT have suggested that the income level of the 
      families in the region improved significantly since the completion of the 
      Pak Mun project. The National Rural Development Committee (NRDC) data 
      waspresentedas evidence. The NRDC data wasanalysed and inferences drawn 
      (see Annex 3 for details). However, the data wasnot used in drawing 
      conclusions. See Section 11.6; Annex 3 for an understanding on the NRDC 
      data.</P>
      <P>The study team finally based its conclusions on the primary data 
      generated by the study as well as other studies conducted specifically in 
      relation to the Pak Mun project. Thus, the 1996-97 Operations Evaluation 
      Department of the World Bank (OED) study was also used as a benchmark.</P>
      <H3>How were the decisions made?</H3>
      <P>The National Energy Authority (NEA) initiated development of the water 
      resources of the Chi-Mun watershed. The preliminary feasibility study 
      completed in 1970 selected the Kaeng Tana rapids as the possible dam site. 
      By May 1979 the project was transferred to EGAT for further feasibility 
      studies.</P>
      <P>Environmental Impact Studies conducted in 1982 indicated that 
      approximately 4000 households would be displaced if the reservoir were 
      impounded to a level of 113 MSL. In order to reduce the project's 
      environmental and social impacts, after a new feasibility study an 
      alternative design with a normal water level of 108 MSL was agreed upon in 
      1985. The relocation of the dam site significantly reduced the extent of 
      displacement from the project to an estimated 248 households. The original 
      project design was further modified by relocating the dam 1.5 km upstream 
      to avoid the submergence of Kaeng Tana rapids, an important environmental 
      and tourist site. EGAT also decided to lower the reservoir to 106 MSL 
      during dry season from January to May and to adjust the dam's operating 
      regime to uncover the upstream Kaeng Saphue rapids, a popular tourist 
      destination. It should be acknowledged that EGAT and the Thai government 
      made substantial sacrifice in power benefits in order to minimise social 
      and environmental impacts.</P>
      <P>However a new EIA was not conducted at this stage that may have 
      identified and anticipated some of the new environmental impacts arising 
      from the new location of the Pak Mun project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
      <P>In April 1989 the project was presented by EGAT to the Council of 
      Ministers of the Thai Government (the Cabinet).&nbsp; Nearly one year 
      later the Pak Mun Hydropower Project was presented as part of a loan 
      package to the Board of Governors of the World Bank. In 1991 when it 
      appeared that project costs would have to be increased, it was presented 
      to NESDB for re-approval.&nbsp; In each of these occasions costs and 
      benefits were presented.</P>
      <P>The Pak Mun dam was described as a multipurpose development project by 
      EGAT in the project document dated March 1988. Claims of associated and 
      attributable benefits from the project, which were modest relative to the 
      value assigned to electricity generation, included irrigation, fishery, 
      navigation improvement and recreation enhancement. Only the benefits of 
      power, irrigation, and fishery were quantified in EGAT's project document. 
      The project later qualified for World Bank loan financing as part of 
      Thailand's Third Power System Development Project. The World Bank's Staff 
      Appraisal Report (SAR) was completed in July 1991; the Bank's Board of 
      Directors approved the project in December 1991.</P>
      <P>In August 1991 when EGAT resubmitted the project to the NESDB for the 
      endorsement of a 70% increase in estimated investment costs, along with 
      the expected annual energy output, the irrigation and fishery benefits 
      remained unchanged. The revisions showed that the Pak Mun dam as a 
      multipurpose development project including resultant irrigation and 
      fishery potentials was still worthwhile. NESDB accepted the project as 
      proposed and endorsed EGAT's revisions. The project's Economic Internal 
      Rate of Return (EIRR) changed from 18.71% in 1988 to 17.35% in 1991- 
      irrigation benefits were quantified. Neither the SAR nor the revised NESDB 
      application in 1991 identified how the irrigation components were going to 
      be financed but benefits were included in both and quantified in the 
      latter's presentation.</P>
      <P>In a recent communication with the Pak Mun study team EGAT has 
      indicated that the power benefit of the Pak Mun Dam is the core benefit of 
      the project. Other benefits such as fishery, irrigation, etc. are 
      secondary, and were not necessary for project justification.</P>
      <P>The conceptual economic benefit of avoided costs for power generation 
      from the next best alternative, was used in the project's economic 
      evaluation (the power only component). The actual hydropower benefits of 
      the dam were not used by EGAT or the World Bank in the economic 
      justification of the project. Both institutions limited their analysis to 
      a switching value analysis, also called Equalising Discount Rate analysis. 
      Such an analysis is used to rank projects by priority once they have been 
      estimated to be economically viable. The lack of proper ex-ante economic 
      analysis means that it is not possible to conduct a comparison of 
      Projected and Actual Economic Value of the project.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet mandated EGAT to establish eligibility criteria and 
      finalise the process of compensation to the affected people. The Governor 
      of the Province of Ubon Ratchathani, the Director-General of the 
      Department of Fisheries, and the Permanent Secretary of the Prime 
      Minister's Office were put in charge of the compensation process. The 
      focus of the process shifted from lost assets like land and other 
      properties to decline in fisheries affecting livelihood.</P>
      <P>Affected villagers were not consulted at the early stages of the 
      decision-making process and there were no attempts to include them in the 
      decision making on the project or the mitigation measures. The issues 
      around inadequate assessment of impacts and compensation were not 
      addressed at the outset. Negotiation on compensation began only after long 
      protests by the affected community and NGOs. Participation of affected 
      villagers and NGOs in the compensation process was first elicited through 
      the Committee for Assistance and Occupational Development of Fish Farmers 
      (CAODFF), formed by order of the Prime Minister in January 1995, eight 
      months after completion of the dam. The Director-General of the Department 
      of Fisheries headed the committee. EGAT remained solely responsible for 
      all costs relating to the works of the various committees and working 
      groups and for the compensations paid out.</P>
      <H3>Did the project comply with the criteria and guidelines of the 
      day?</H3>
      <P>The Pak Mun project complied with the standards of the Cabinet at the 
      time and was thus approved in May 1990.</P>
      <P>Under the 1992 Promotion and Conservation of National Environment Act, 
      reservoirs with capacities larger than 100 Million cubic meters (MCM) or 
      surface areas greater than 15 square km require an Environment Impact 
      Assessment Study. The EIA studies have to be submitted to the Office of 
      Environmental Policy and Planning for consideration prior to being 
      submitted to the Cabinet or appropriate authorities for endorsement for 
      permission to proceed.&nbsp; Pak Mun dam with a reservoir storage capacity 
      of 225 MCM and surface area of 60 square km would require an environmental 
      impact study under the 1992 law. Since the Cabinet endorsed the project in 
      May 1990, the provisions under this act did not impinge on Pak Mun 
dam.</P>
      <P>The 1981 EIA produced inadequate baseline information. Baseline studies 
      of aquatic resources need to cover the different seasons and a timeframe 
      of at least 2 years. Assessment of natural fluctuations in abundance of 
      fish populations as well as the cumulative impacts on aquatic resources 
      from other development projects in the watershed was necessary. An 
      appropriate socio-economic survey was required to identify the extent of 
      dependency of the local population on fisheries. Further, the project that 
      was approved by the Cabinet was different from the one for which the 
      original EIA was conducted in 1981.</P>
      <P>By the time the project reached implementation stage, the nature, 
      extent and site of the project had changed and this warranted a new EIA. 
      By 1990, the Pollution Control Department and the Office of Environmental 
      Policy and Planning of the Ministry of Science, Technology and the 
      Environment had also evolved an extensive set of guidelines, standards, 
      classifications and procedures in place to carry out appropriate EIA. The 
      World Bank too had an extensive set of procedures and guidelines in place 
      for the Terms of Reference, implementation and review of EIA. The Pak Mun 
      dam did not comply with the existing World Bank guidelines that required a 
      new EIA and appropriate impact mitigation prior to the implementation of 
      the redesigned project. If the Pak Mun project had complied with the World 
      Bank's standards at the time of appraisal in 1990, many of the serious 
      unexpected impacts could have been anticipated and avoided. By the time 
      mitigation measures related to fisheries were put in place in response to 
      people's protests, the dam construction work was completed.</P>
      <P>Compensatory measures apart from inundated houses and land were 
      formulated and implemented at a later stage of the process. The monitoring 
      of fish species and fisheries activities after the completion of the dam 
      has been haphazard and not systematic. The performance of the fish ladder 
      has not been adequately evaluated, and monitoring withdrawn. Adaptive 
      management such as relocation and improvement of the fish ladder might 
      have helped, but have not been considered.</P>
      <P>The process of compensation of affected fisheries households has been a 
      long and tedious process as a result of inadequate baseline studies that 
      should have systematically defined the number and location of households 
      depending on fisheries and also the value of their fish catch.</P>
      <H3>How would this project be viewed in today's context?</H3>
      <P>The economic premise on which the project was justified can be 
      questioned. The planners confused a switching value analysis, also called 
      Equalising Discount Rate analysis, with a traditional economic benefit 
      analysis. The former analysis should be performed to choose the best of 
      two project implementation solutions that have already proven to be both 
      economically viable.&nbsp; When applied to power projects the switching 
      value analysis should be done on projects that have the same dependable 
      capacity and this was not done in case of Pak Mun project.</P>
      <P>Since the Pak Mun project was in reality conceived and operated as part 
      of EGAT's power development plan to respond to long-term national load 
      forecasts, its claim as a multipurpose project is misleading.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>In the present context, the absence of assessment and lack of 
      consideration of the project impact on fish and fisheries in Mun River in 
      the initial planning and decision-making stages would be considered a 
      critical lapse. This is more so given the fact that this World Bank funded 
      project was approved and implemented in the early 1990s. The absence of 
      comprehensive assessment of the households whose fishing occupation, 
      fishing income, and subsistence was affected by the dam at appraisal meant 
      considerable unplanned cost escalation in terms of compensation. The 
      participation of affected communities and civil society was elicited late 
      in the process of compensation and mitigation. Confusion resulted from 
      lack of clear division of institutional responsibility and this was 
      compounded by lack of clarity in eligibility criteria as a result of which 
      affected people spent nearly ten years in negotiating compensation claims 
      with the government.</P>
      <P>With hindsight, as required by the World Bank guidelines, a fresh EIA 
      for the redesigned project would have been called for whose terms of 
      reference should have included nature and extent of impact of the project 
      on livelihoods based on fisheries. Such a study would have been useful in 
      making available relevant baseline for comprehensive identification of 
      fishing villages, the extent of population affected, the level of 
      dependency on fisheries by season, the prevailing income, and the 
      resettlement location options allowing continued access to the riverine 
      resources and alternatives.</P>
      <P>If plans and policies were adequately implemented with respect to 
      social impacts and resolution of conflicts, villagers would not have had 
      to waste time and effort in negotiating and protesting against the 
      dam.&nbsp; Nor would the country as a whole have lost an important 
      ecosystem.</P>
      <P>One of the key conclusions emerging from the study is that if all the 
      benefits and costs were adequately assessed, the study team believe it is 
      unlikely that the project would have been built in the current 
context.</P><!--/ BODY TEXT --></FONT><!-- FOOTER -->
