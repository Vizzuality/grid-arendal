face=Arial size=2>Commission on Water for the 21st Century</FONT></B><FONT

land and water crisis in river basins contributed to the total of 25 million 
environmental refugees last year, which for the first time exceeded the number 
of war-related refugees. By 2025, the number of environmental refugees could 
quadruple." </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>River basins and their 
associated wetlands, some of which encompass hundreds of thousands of square 
miles, not only provide for humans, but also maintain the health of animals and 
plants, as well as the functioning of all ecosystems surrounding river basins, 
from forests, to wetlands and grasslands. As a consequence of their 
mismanagement, for example, North American freshwater species face a five times 
higher risk of extinction rates than land-based animals.</FONT><I><FONT

Commission on Water for the 21st Century</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> will 
present its report on a vision for the future at the </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Second World Water Forum &amp; Ministerial Conference</FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>, to be held March 17-22, 2000 in The Hague, the Netherlands. 
The theme will be 'From Vision to Action,' and restoring the health of the 
world's rivers will be a primary goal of the Conference.. The Forum will be 
hosted by the World Water Council and the Dutch Government. A framework for 
action to accompany the Commission's report will be presented by the Global 
Water Partnership (GWP) and dozens of studies and innovations will be displayed 
by governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private 
sector.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Commission finds that some of 
the most stressed rivers are:</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 
</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Yellow River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2> in China's most important agricultural region ran dry in its lower 
reaches 226 days out of the year in 1997.</FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=2> 
</FONT></I></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Some 400 million people live in China's 
North China Plain, which is watered by the Yellow River and two other rivers. 
The region is a major food producer for the whole of China. Irrigation is 
crucial, and to compensate for the lack of river water, farmers are drawing up 
large amounts of water from aquifers, rapidly depleting them. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>All three rivers are severely polluted. 
The industrialization of China has caused much of the problem, which has been 
magnified by the construction of multiple dams along the rivers.</FONT><B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2> </FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Health problems 
are growing in China because of these serious water quality problems. 
Agriculture is also a growing water-related health problem -  vegetables and 
strawberries are polluted by dirty water, and heavy metals enter grain crops. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Chinese Government has spent $3 
billion over the past four years on a conservation program in the North China 
Plain, the main focus of which was on improving irrigation technology, mainly 
introducing drip and sprinkle irrigation systems on farms. These use much less 
water than the traditional open ditches with running water. The Chinese 
Government already knows what it must do to improve the river and is working on 
it: better irrigation technology, agronomics (cropping patterns, greenhouses, 
distribution of irrigated water) and better management.</FONT><B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2> </FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 
</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Amu Darya's</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> 
and </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Syr Darya's</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2> flow into the Aral Sea has been reduced by three-quarters, causing a 
catastrophic regression in sea levels, which dropped 53 feet (16 meters) between 
1962 and 1994. The decreased flow in combination with increases in fertilizer 
runoff and exposure of the seabed, with the salts found there, have contributed 
to the increase in infant mortality -- now the highest of all regions of the 
former Soviet Union -- and disease. There has been a 30-fold increase in the 
rates of chronic bronchitis, typhoid, arthritis, and cancer, the Commission 
says. In addition, 20 of the 24 species of fish that used to be present in the 
sea have disappeared.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>Colorado River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> in the 
western United States, irrigating more than 3.7 million acres (1.5 million 
hectares) of farmland, is so exploited and polluted by agriculture that little 
is left to protect the ecosystem downstream, which has turned from lush green to 
salty and desolate marshes. In addition, the intensive use of the river prevents 
the recharge of groundwater that is already being overdrawn at an unsustainable 
rate.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>More than 90% of the natural flow of 
the </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nile River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>, the longest waterway in the world, is used by irrigation or evaporation 
primarily from reservoirs. What reaches the Mediterranean is heavily polluted 
irrigation drainage, salty and heavy in nitrates, and industrial and municipal 
waste.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Just three percent of surface water 
in the </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Volga River Basin</FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>, which holds 61 million people in Russia, is considered an 
environmentally safe source of drinking water. Some 42 million tons of toxic 
waste pile up each year in the Basin, causing immense health 
problems.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Ganges River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> in South Asia, which 
serves 500 million people, is so depleted during the dry season that one of the 
most unique and precious ecosystems in the world -- the Sunderband wetlands in 
Bangladesh -- is seriously threatened. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>The small but historic </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jordan 
River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>, crucial to the desert economies of the 
region, can no longer meet the needs of the people and the environment. Just 
one-third of its natural flow now reaches the Dead Sea, which is disappearing 
slowly. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Only two of the world's major 
rivers can be classified as healthy: the Amazon River  a powerful stream with 
few settlements or industry on its bank and the Congo River in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, also because it is a strong river with few industrial centers near its 
banks;</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>While water quality has improved in 
the North, ecosystem restoration still has a long way to go as toxic substances 
are still circulating in fish, shellfish and sediments, and excessive use of 
fertilization still occurs in agriculture. Some countries in Western Europe have 
large concentrations of livestock, especially pigs, which are polluting surface 
water and groundwater with unsafe concentrations of 
nitrates.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The solution can only come from 
changes in how land is utilized in river basins. </FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Nevertheless, many rivers will never return to their original state, nor 
will all forms of aquatic life return, the Commission 
says.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Rivers can be 
restored</FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is possible, however, for 
governments, businesses, farmers, and consumer groups to work together in 
establishing proper policies and institutions that can restore rivers 
sufficiently so that people can use them safely and that most aquatic life can 
return. Among the major rivers undergoing significant restoration efforts 
are:</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>St. Lawrence River</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> provides a good 
example of cooperation between two countries  Canada and the United States  to 
improve the health of an international river basin, including the Great Lakes 
and wetlands. Problems remain, however, especially continuing pollution from 
airborne contaminants and accumulation of toxic substances. When beluga whales 
die, they must be disposed of in secured hazardous waste sites due to the 
accumulation of toxic substances. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>By the 
1960s, the </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Rhine River</FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2> in Western Europe had become practically a dead river -- 
unfit for drinking water and dangerous for agriculture if used without 
treatment. Several species of fish had become extinct, and most other fish 
populations were seriously threatened.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>A 
major chemical spill into the Rhine during the 1980s spurred all countries that 
share Europe's major waterway to create a framework under an already existing 
river commission to improve water quality.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>As a result, the Rhine has come back to life, though nowhere near its 
original state. People can drink treated water from the river now, and it can be 
safely used for agriculture. In addition, many fish species such as salmon have 
returned.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Murray-Darling River Basin</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> covers more 
than 385,000 sq. mi. (one million sq. km), or one-sixth of Australia. It 
includes 24 major tributaries. By the 1970s, the two main once pristine rivers 
had become thick with blue-green algae and high salinity because of decades of 
extensive agriculture. Removal of natural vegetation had altered the water 
balance of the land, so that water tables rose dramatically, leading over time 
to salinization of the soil and threatening domestic water supplies for much of 
South Australia.</FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=2> 
</FONT></I></B><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>To deal with these problems and 
others, the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) Initiative was established in 1987. The 
Initiative provided for a unified way to deal with the river environment, 
management of irrigated and dryland regions, and other basin-wide issues. The 
river environment sub-program covers three broad areas  improvements to water 
quality; river flows with respect to balancing human and environmental needs, 
and</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>nation 
conservation. "This has been one of the most successful river basin management 
operations in the world," says Mr. Serageldin.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>The </FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Lerma River</FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2> runs through the middle of Mexico, beginning in the mountains 
near Mexico City at an altitude of some 9,000 feet (nearly 3,000 meters) and 
descending to 5,200 feet (1,600 meters) where it runs into Lake Chapala, the 
largest lake in Mexico.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The river runs 
through the economic heartland of Mexico. Growing industry and agriculture led 
to the overuse of both water from the river and from aquifers, especially since 
the mid 1980s. This resulted in significant pressure on surface water sources 
and alarming declines in the levels of Lake Chapala.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>Because of untreated waste from both industry and agriculture, 
the river became very polluted, which also harmed the lake. This led to growing 
health problems. A major problem was jurisdictional. Five states share the Lerma 
River, with each state government controlling only its section of the river. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Beginning early this 
decade,</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>and 
state authorities began to work with private industry and user groups to create 
a framework to clean up the Lerma River and Lake Chapala. A written agreement 
now guarantees water to everybody -- for business, for residents and for 
farmers, cities and factories. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>In 
addition, the federal government passed a law that implements the accord and 
allows local organizers to control the water supply. The price of water is being 
raised to cover its true cost. As part of this agreement, polluters pay a 
surcharge to help clean up the river. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>"While modern water engineering has proven remarkably successful at 
supplying water during the dry season, improving transportation, providing 
energy, a constant supply of water, and have guaranteed the increase in food 
production to feed large part of the world's population, it has failed in large 
measure to sustain the ecosystems that provide this water," says Sandra Postel, 
Senior Advisor to the Commission. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Rivers, 
besides bringing drinking water to people, sustaining fisheries, diluting waste 
products, offer convenient shipping channels, create habitats, flood plains and 
wetlands for a rich diversity of aquatic life, contribute to water purification 
and natural flood control, the Commission says. River systems also deliver 
nutrients to the seas and thereby nourish marine life, especially in coastal 
zones. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Rivers in developing countries are 
being hit the hardest because of increased demand that causes decreased flow 
through withdrawals, and the failure to clean waste before discharging it into 
them. River water quality has improved substantially for some pollutants in 
industrial countries over the past 15 years, but declined substantially in most 
developing countries. All countries face stiff challenges in improving the way 
they manage land in river basins, water use, water quality, and 
ecosystems.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Increased 
demand</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>  The world's population increased 
from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6 billion today. People in the post-World War II 
period began dumping millions of tons of waste annually into the world's rivers 
from increased agriculture, rapidly growing cities and burgeoning factories. 
This is far in excess of what these rivers traditionally have absorbed and has 
overwhelmed their capacity to clean themselves out through natural processes. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>In the past 50 years especially, people 
began cultivating more marginal land around cities, cutting down forests, 
damming rivers, and other activities that changed the entire ecosystems in river 
basins, the Commission says. This has meant more flooding during rainy seasons, 
and lower flows during dry seasons. It has also meant more sediment buildup, and 
more erosion in rivers and lakes, and more fertilizers reaching the water 
environment.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Commission warns that the 
accelerating depletion of useable water resources poses a major challenge to 
achieve world food security. The world's population now derives 40 percent of 
its food from irrigated lands. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>In 1800, 
just before the dawn of the modern irrigation age, the total amount of irrigated 
area totaled nearly 20 million acres (8 million hectares), an area about the 
size of Austria. From this small starting base, it climbed fivefold during the 
19th century. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Much of irrigation's 
scientific and technical foundation was built during that century's latter half, 
and these advances made possible large new schemes, particularly in Asia. From a 
total of 100 million acres (40 million hectares) in 1900, the global irrigation 
base grew to some 250 million acres (100 million hectares) by 1950, a 2.5 fold 
increase. By 1995, world irrigated area had grown two-and-a-half fold again, to 
just over 630 million acres (255 million hectares)  an area more than 
two-and-a-half times the size of Egypt.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Decreased flow</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>  Rivers are in trouble 
because of the construction and operation of dams, dikes and levees, by 
excessive river diversions for farming, by the draining of wetlands, and by 
other human activities. In addition, the decreased flow and increased pollutants 
result in degradation of downstream wetlands, deltas and coastal 
ecosystems.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Failure to clean rivers 
</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Often only a small percentage  globally 
less than 10 percent of total waste, which includes farm run-off, industrial 
pollution and human waste, is treated before it enters rivers. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>"People in the developing world 
understand that their rivers are getting dirtier, but it is very costly to clean 
up this waste," says Guy Le Moigne, Senior Advisor to the World Water 
Commission. </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>How to Protect the World's 
Rivers </FONT></B><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>The World Commission on 
Water for the 21st Century</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> is pointing to 
integrated land and water resources policy reforms for entire river systems, 
even as they cut across local government boundaries, as the best method to save 
these degraded rivers, conserve their invaluable ecosystems, and prevent 
conflicts in use. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The main problem is 
lack of coordinated management in watersheds, the Commission says. People don't 
recognize this. More development without good management increases the extremes 
-- pulling out trees for agriculture will increase erosion, and so on. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Even countries as advanced as the United 
States often have states and local governments with conflicting interests over 
the same river basin, such as the Colorado River, which prevents a unified 
approach to protecting a river's ecosystem. In addition, those who decide on 
water uses for irrigation are often working in isolation from those who design 
projects for drinking water, industrial water, flood protection and other water 
projects. This "single sector" approach has not been effective because it 
typically addresses the needs of one sector, which often means other sectors and 
ecosystems lose out. Often, none of them are consulting environmentalists on the 
needs of the ecosystems, which are almost certain to be losers. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Commission is still working on its 
report, but its thinking is clearly towards recommending a holistic approach 
based on environmental, social and economic factors drawing on the 
</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dublin </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>and 
</FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Rio Agenda 21</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial 
size=2> approaches adopted by the world community in 1992. This calls 
for:</FONT><BR><BR>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial>conserving freshwater

decisions;</FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial>development of a realistic

the sources for financing them as well as the development of new low cost 
treatment technologies and reuse;</FONT><BR>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial>changing the concept of 
water as a "free" commodity to one based on its real economic value, using 
pricing to provide incentives to reduce waste and promote investment, while 
recognizing the needs of the poor and the environment;</FONT><BR>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial>expanding these principles 
to international river basins.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>"If people 
pay at least the full cost of water services provided to them, they will waste 
less and financing will be available for both water supply and cleanup," says 
William Cosgrove, Director of the Vision Unit, which is acting as the 
Commission's secretariat. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>"We must adopt 
a comprehensive framework to address political, economic, social and 
environmental dimensions of resource management issues," says Mr. Serageldin. 
"We must address energy, public health, water sanitation and environment quality 
within a single framework. Land and water degradation issues would no longer be 
seen as an environmental issue, but rather as very central to the sustainable 
development agenda of a country." </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>Upstream and downstream issues, which often conflict, as well as surface 
and sub-surface water management issues, must all be addressed involving all 
actors, the Commission says. This can help to minimize conflicts over water and 
other resource allocations and use, because of the opportunities it provides for 
the participation of multiple interested parties, called "stakeholders," in 
decision making. Among stakeholders, we count governments (national and local), 
private sector, professional groups, user associations, the civil society, NGOs 
and community-based organizations, especially women's groups. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>"The world has to significantly increase 
water productivity while at the same time restoring the world's damaged rivers, 
if we are to have any hope of meeting the water needs of the 8 billion people, 
while protecting the environment," says Mr. Serageldin. </FONT><BR>
