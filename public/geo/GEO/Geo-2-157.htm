      <P align=center>SERIOUS SALINITY WARNING MUST BE HEEDED - TUCKEY</P></B>
      <CENTER></CENTER></FONT>
      <P>Australia is facing massive economic, environmental and social 
      challenges due to the widespread and growing phenomenon of dryland 
      salinity, a National Science Briefing in Parliament House, Canberra was 
      told today.</P>
      <P>The National Science Briefing forum on salinity was chaired by the 
      Federal Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey. The 
      Minister introduced speakers, including Mr Alex Campbell, Chair of the <A 
      href="http://www.lwrrdc.gov.au/commissi.htm#CommissionedPrograms-NationalDrylandSalinityRDEProgram">National 
      Dryland Salinity Program</A> (NDSP), Dr Tom Hatton from CSIRO Land and 
      Water Division and Mrs Doreen Wheelwright , Deputy Chair of the Lachlan 
      Catchment Committee.</P>
      <P>"With the WA wheatbelt in my electorate of O'Connor, I certainly 
      appreciate the seriousness of salinity and the information provided at 
      today's briefing is a further wake up call for all levels of government," 
      Mr Tuckey said. "We need to work with farmers and rural communities to 
      find a solution to the plague of salinity."</P>
      <P>Dr Tom Hatton of CSIRO Land and Water said: "The costs associated with 
      meeting these challenges are high, the costs of doing nothing 
      incalculable.</P>
      <P>"Australia currently has 25 million square kilometres of salt affected 
      land and this is likely to increase six fold in the coming decades," Dr 
      Hatton said. "Western Australia, one of the worst affected states, has 18 
      million square kilometres of salt affected land and this is increasing at 
      a rate equal to one football field an hour.</P>
      <P>"Lost agricultural production exceeds $130 million annually; costs to 
      infrastructure are over $100 million a year; lost water resources are 
      valued at around $100 million each in some local supply catchments and the 
      impacts on biodiversity are huge and include wetlands of international 
      significance - all attributable to salinity."</P>
      <P>Currently of great concern is Western Australia’s Fitzgerald River 
      area.</P>
      <P>"The area is recognised internationally as ‘megadiverse’. Surveys under 
      way indicate the region possesses an extraordinary number of plants and 
      animals – most locally endemic to WA. Salinity now places many of these 
      species in threat of extinction," Dr Hatton said.</P>
      <P>Clean drinking water is also at stake.</P>
      <P>"In South Australia, at least 20 per cent of surface water resources 
      are sufficiently saline to be above desirable limits for human 
      consumption. Next century, these limits will be pushed further and for 
      longer periods," he said.</P>
      <P>"To achieve significant improvement of the salinity problem, 
      intervention on a massive scale is required.</P>
      <P>"Research has shown that marginal intervention returns less than 
      marginal salinity abatement. The large-scale salinisation processes we 
      have set in train are insensitive to all but the most aggressive 
      remediation.</P>
      <P>"For example, tree planting is needed across most of the landscape, 
      including 50-70 per cent of catchment areas, to achieve significant 
      reductions in the ultimate extent of the salinity."</P>
      <P>Dr Hatton emphasises; however, that the response times of salinity 
      control will be long and it is unlikely these systems will be completely 
      restored within normal human timescales.</P>
      <P>Mr Alex Campbell, Chairman of the National Dryland Salinity Program, 
      told the Briefing that more than 80 regional towns and cities have costs 
      related to salinity – and even Sydney is being affected. The costs include 
      damage to building foundations, bridges, pipelines and roads.</P>
      <P>"Up to 30 per cent of regional roads are being affected with major 
      highway reconstruction costing up to $1 million per kilometre," he 
      said.</P>
      <P>Mr Campbell stressed that unprecedented changes in management practices 
      are needed.</P>
      <P>"We also need to explore the broader options of saline aquaculture and 
      growing various salt tolerant pastures, crops and woody perennials," he 
      said. "With effective research and management, we could use salinised 
      resources beneficially for both economic and environmental outcomes."</P>
      <P>Mrs Doreen Wheelwright, Deputy Chair of the Lachlan Catchment 
      Committee, told the Briefing that the processes involved in managing 
      salinity are still insufficiently clear to allow definitive management 
      options to be given in all cases.</P>
      <P>"There is no single answer and a mix of management options is 
      necessary," she said.</P>
      <P>She called for increased funding to continue research into the cause 
      and effect of salinity and to develop appropriate management tools.</P><B>
