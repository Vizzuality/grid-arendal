been developed to depict how humans have shaped destiny in the new century that 
is fast approaching. These visions are based on scenario involving highly 
sophisticated breakthrough with vast potentials – colonies in space, robot 
operated plants, computers that match human intelligence and so on. Major 
question is whether such scientific and technological advancements are based on 
a position where man and machine co-operate with each other or has machine 
overpowered man? The unprecedented growth in world consumption and production is 
leading to environmental stress through impacts that are both global and local. 
Some kinds of environmental degradation are truly of global concern, such as 
global warming and depletion of the ozone layer. Others are international – acid 
raid, the state of ocean, in several countries. Others are more localised,- air 
pollution, water pollution, soil degradation, desertification and so 
on.</SPAN><SPAN

<P align=justify class=MsoBodyText><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The emergence of 
environmental concerns during the past two decades has led several people to 
question whether growth of the cost imposed on the environment through depletion 
of non-renewable natural resources. A question also arises whether poverty and 
environmental degradation are inter related? What is the relation between 
environment and economic growth. The inter relationship between poverty, 
environment and development has also been recognised.</SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
inter relationship between poverty and environment has been recognised by the 
World Commission on Environment and Development Report as “poverty is a major 
cause and effect of global environmental problem.”2&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
interrelationship between the exploitation and degradation of environment and 
natural resources, on the one hand, and development and poverty, on the other, 
is particularly relevant in the rural areas of developing countries3. The 
linkage between poverty and environment defines a particular characteristic of 
environmental disruption. In rural areas, these linkage materialise through the 
over exploitation of resources.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">At 
the international and national levels, 1992 was a vibrant year as environmental 
concern, the conservation strategy and policy statement on environment and 
development were presented to parliament during his period.4 One of the more 
positive approaches was the radical concept of economic development. “. . 
.sustainable development as an approach to environment implies meeting the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future generation to meet 
their needs.”5 Poor people are pushed towards the exploitation of marginal areas 
of low productivity, tend to over exploit the natural resources resulting in a 
consequent decline in productivity. Cyclical relationship between poverty and 
environmental degradation takes place. As poverty increases, natural environment 
degrades, the prospects for further livelihood decline. Environmental 
degradation generates more poverty. At least 500 million of the world poorest 
people live in ecologically marginal areas.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Another 
reason for environmental pollution and degradation is over utilisation of 
renewable resources. The use of firewood – the use of most renewable resource is 
driven by expanding population. Within 40 years the amount of cropland available 
per person is projected to fall by half from today’s already meagre 0.27 
hectare. Soil degradation has reduced the availability of agricultural land per 
capita. By 2050 more than 2 billion people will live in regions facing land 
scarcity, with extensive and increasing desertification and land degradation, 
particularly in parts of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, about a third of the 
earth’s original forest have disappeared. Two-fifths of the worlds people depend 
on water absorbed by the mountain ranges. But when the trees have been felled, 
rain water sheet off the land, causing floods and droughts. Tens of millions of 
hectares in India have become more vulnerable to flooding as a result of 
deforestation.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
overuse of fertiliser causes great water pollution problems. Heavy use of 
phosphatic fertiliser have appeared in ground water in six districts in West 
Bengal, killing some of those drinking water. If this trend continues, world may 
see a five fold increase in waste generation ozone layer has thinned by 10% over 
temperate region. The ultraviolet light is also a major cause of cataracts, 
which cause more than half the blindness in the world and claim sight of 17 
million people every year. It penetrates surface of the sea, killing the 
plankton which is vital in the food chain.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Rapid 
industrialisation in many countries has greatly increased pollution. Vehicle 
exhaust, coal burning and smoke from factories form small particles in the air 
that cause serious health damage. Air pollution from industrial emission, car 
exhaust and burning of fuels kills more than 2.7 million people every year from 
respiratory damage, heart and lung damage and cancer. Besides harming human 
health, air pollution causes direct economic losses. Germany loses an estimated 
$4.7 billion in agricultural production every year as a result of air pollution; 
Poland $2 billion, Italy $1.8 billion and Sweden $41.5 billion. Polluted air 
drifts across national frontiers, with emission of sulphur dioxide in one 
country raining acid on another. Acid deposition are particularly high in 
industrial areas such as south-east china, North-East India, and Thailand. The 
effects are felt in agricultural. In India wheat yields have been cut in half in 
areas close to large sources of sulphur dioxide emission.&nbsp;<O:P>

<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Global 
warming is one of the most serious of all the environmental challenges. It 
threatens to disrupt the remarkably stable climate the world has enjoyed since 
last 10,000 years. And in is likely to cause widespread economic, social and 
environmental destruction over the next century. By the estimates, the worlds 
harvest will be slightly reduced in next century. A recent study predicts that 
harvest will decline by more than 30% in India and Pakistan. Rising seas may 
threaten the lives of millions in developing countries. With a one meter rise in 
sea level, due in part to global warming, Bangladesh could see its land area 
shrink by 17%, through it produces only 0.3% of global emission. Egypt could see 
12% of its territory disappear under the waves.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">A 
conservative estimate of environmental damage in India puts the figure at more 
than $10 billion a year or 4.5% of GDP in 1992. That is, urban air pollution 
costs India $1.3 billion a year. Water degradation leads to health costs 
amounting to $5.7b every year, nearly three fifths of the total environmental 
costs. Soil erosion affects 83-163 million hectares of land every year. 
Deforestation, which proceeded at the rate of 0.6% a year between 1981 and 1990, 
leads to annual costs of $214 million.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">It 
should be noted that renewable sources of energy, evils of large scale 
industrialisation and dangers of environmental pollution were recognised by 
Gandhiji eight decades ago, as he put more emphasis on non-violent upliftment of 
village economy and the utilisation of labour-intensive technique of 
production.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">In 
modern terminology, Gandhiji’s strategy is modified in terms of pattern of 
growth, which preliminary uses renewable resources and a minimum utilisation of 
non-renewable resources. Though concern for the environment was not the focus of 
such prescriptions, yet such strategy helped to minimise the degradation of 
environment. The environment-friendly nature of Gandhian economic is further 
revealed when one notes the emphasis on the ‘last man’ In such policy, poverty 
has been described as the most severe polluter. The Gandhian prescription of 
‘simple living’ also attempts to put a check on unlimited consumption and 
unending exploitation of natural resources.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
eminent Gandhian thinker and economist, J.C. Kumarappa drew attention towards 
these critical matters of environmental pollution and preservation of natural 
resources about half a century ago and exhorted that mankind should strive for 
establishing ‘Economy of permanence,’ rather than reckless destruction of 
natural resources. This could be achieved by a judicious minimum use of the 
non-renewable resource, thereby saving them for future generation and adopting a 
productive system in which whatever is drained out of nature is restored back 
through the natural process. “Work in nature consists in the effort to put forth 
by the various factors – insentient and sentient – which co-operate to complete 
this cycle of life. If this cycle is broken, at any stage, at any time, 
consciously or unconsciously, violence results as a consequence of such a break. 
When violence intervenes in this way, growth or progress is stopped, ending 
finally in destruction and waste. . . Self-interest and self preservation demand 
complete non-violence, co-operation and submission, to the ways of nature if we 
are to maintain permanency by non-interference with and by not short-circuiting 
the cycle of life.6 Whatever is drawn out of nature is to be recycled through 
the natural process.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Local 
raw material should be processed locally. What could not be producted in a 
decentralised system could be producted by centralised or capital-intensive 
method of production. While clarifying his views, he had previously asserted 
that “. . . I do visualise electricity, ship-building, machine-making and the 
like existing side by side village craft . . .<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>they should not be used as a means of 
exploitation of others.”7 He also noted that “. . . the heavy machinery for the 
work of a public utility which can not be undertaken by human labour has its 
inevitable place. But all that should be owned by the state and used entirely 
for the benefit of the people.”8 Equal distribution of income and wealth go 
hand-in-hand with proper balance between centralised and decentralised methods 
of production in urban and rural areas respectively for the welfare of the 
masses.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Gandhiji’s 
emphasis on labour intensive of production does not indicate that he was 
advocating obsolete machinery with less productivity. He was in favour of simple 
tools, which save individual labour and lighten the burden of millions of 
cottages.9 While clarifying the role of machinery, he mentioned that 
“mechanisation is good when the hands are few for the work intended to be 
accomplished. It is an evil when there are more hands than required for the 
works, as is the case in India. The problem is how to utilise their idle hours, 
which are equal to the working days of six months in the year.”10 He was against 
the craze for machinery in a labour-surplus economy like India and accepted the 
utilisation of modern tools and implements</SPAN><SPAN

</SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">provided 
they help in reducing unnecessary human labour. He wanted production by the 
masses and not mass production. Here, it should be noted that the adoption of 
labour-intensive technique of production to create job opportunities was 
suggested by World Development Report – 1990, especially to developing 
countries. It was pointed out that “. . .Against the background of achievement, 
is all the more staggering, shameful that more than one billion people in the 
developing world are living in poverty. Progress in raising average in comes, 
however welcome, must not distract attention from this massive and continuing 
burden of poverty.11 For removal of poverty and unemployment, it was suggested 
that” . . . rapid and politically sustainable progress on poverty has been 
achieved by pursuing a strategy that has two equally important elements. The 
first element is to promote the productive use of the poor’s most abundant 
asset, labour. It calls for policies that harness market incentives, social and 
political institutions, infrastructure and technology to that end . . . 
switching to an efficient, labour intensive pattern of development and investing 
more in the human capital of the poor are not only consistent with faster long 
term growth, they contributed to it”.12 It was further noted “since labour is an 
abundant resource, encouraging its use is generally consistent with rapid and 
efficient growth.13 Indian planners are not unfamiliar with these views and 
suggestions. They were discussed by Gandhiji over eight decades ago, initially 
in Hind Swaraj and then in Young India and Harijan with special focus on Khadi 
and village industries. He stated “I have not contemplated, much less advised 
the abandonment of a single, healthy, life-giving industrial activity for the 
sake of hand-spinning. The entire foundation of the spinning-wheel rests on the 
fact that there are cores of semi-unemployment people in India. . . the spinning 
wheel is destructive of no enterprise whatever. It is life-giving activity”<O:P> 
</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
essence of the Gandhian approach to technological progress lies in treating 
Nature as a friend and benefactor. This approach is opposite to what we have 
practising so far in the name of technology. All decentralised technological 
systems which makes use of natures-in-built processes demand a settlement 
pattern different from the heavily one that form our preference now. But if we 
take a broader view, they can become the harbingers of a advancement, leading 
development with the help of eco-friendly technology.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P align=justify class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">When 
the basic problems of Indian economy are analyzed, the pattern of income 
distribution, inequality, poverty, unemployment are still existing as they were 
when Gandhiji advocated the spinning-wheel as a panacea for all ills. Thus, his 
emphasis on Khadi and village industries was not a temporary measure, but a 
permanent solution to overcome the root problems of poverty and unemployment 
from India.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
