1.   This report reviews progress made in the implementation of the objectives
set out in chapter 18 of Agenda 21 (Freshwater resources),1/ taking into account
the decisions taken by the Commission on Sustainable Development on this subject
at its second session, in 1994.  Key issues of concern regarding the state of
the global freshwater resources have emerged during the preparatory process of
the comprehensive assessment of the freshwater resources of the world.  The use
of water in many regions of the world gives serious reason for concern as to its
long-term sustainability, particularly when the need for the preservation of
natural ecosystems is taken into account.  The assessment shows that, at the
present time, as much as one third of the world's population lives in countries
suffering from moderate-to-severe stress in terms of water use relative to
availability.  Furthermore, by 2025, as much as two thirds of the world's
population could be living in water-stressed countries.  With population
increases, economic growth and rising living standards, it may be necessary to
use most of the world's readily accessible renewable water resources to satisfy
the needs of agriculture, industry and households, and to maintain adequate
river flows and protect aquatic ecosystems.

2.   Because of the significant link between water resources and agriculture,
forestry, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and urban development, degrading
water quality and the misuse of available water resources impose a major threat
to the health and development possibilities of the population in large areas of
the world, even in areas currently with abundant water resources.  Present
lifestyle changes and aspirations, including significant increases in the
standard of living and per capita income, continued rapid population growth,
industrial development, agricultural trends and increased urbanization - all
demand higher water consumption in the decades to come.  This requires close
attention to water-management issues and to the adequacy of production and
consumption patterns


                                I.  KEY OBJECTIVES

3.   Chapter 18 of Agenda 21 contains the following seven programme areas:

     (a)  Integrated water resources development and management;

     (b)  Water resources assessment;

     (c)  Protection of water resources, water quality and aquatic ecosystems;

     (d)  Drinking-water supply and sanitation;

     (e)  Water and sustainable urban development;

     (f)  Water for sustainable food production and rural development;

     (g)  Impacts of climate change on water resources.

4.   The key objectives continue to be the provision of an adequate supply of
water of good quality for the entire world's population, while preserving the
hydrological and biological functions of ecosystems, combating vectors of
water-related diseases and adapting human activities within the limits of
sustainability.  It is now increasingly recognized that the latter objective
requires more efficient water-resources management and use.


                       II.  SUCCESSES AND PROMISING CHANGES

             A.  Integrated water resource development and management

5.   Three of the most important contributions of chapter 18 are:

     (a)  The establishment of thematic areas under which individual countries
can formulate and implement national agendas;

     (b)  The emphasis on integrated water resource planning, development and
management;

     (c)  The emphasis on water as an economic and social good, whose quantity
and quality determine the nature of its utilization.

Effective implementation of the recently adopted Global Programme of Action for
the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities 2/ requires
an integrative approach be used in order to facilitate simultaneous
consideration of freshwater and marine issues as components of a single water-
management continuum.  Such an approach has encouraged, inter alia, the
development of an iterative approach to policy formulation and resource
planning, paying particular attention to the failures as well as the successes
of various water-related projects throughout the world.  It is currently being
tested in ongoing technical cooperation activities in many developing countries,
such as, Bolivia, Central African Republic, India, Jordan, Morocco, Nepal,
Niger, Peru, Senegal and Yemen.  Through water-sector assessments, diagnostic
studies and national programmes related to water resource planning and
management at the river-basin level, an integrated approach is also being taken
to water use and the equitable allocation of water among various users.  It is
characterized by the participation of users and local communities in the
decision-making process, including decisions related to the financing of
infrastructure.  An encouraging note is the fact that the role of women in water
resource management is beginning to be increasingly recognized, at both national
and local levels.


                  B.  Water resource assessment and the impact of
                      climate change on water resources

6.   Recent studies carried out by various United Nations agencies indicated
that, in recent times, national hydrological services and agencies,
particularly - but not only - in developing countries were becoming less capable
of assessing their respective water resources.  Many national agencies have been
facing reductions in observation networks and staffing at a time when water
demand is rising rapidly and when the need for sustainable water resource use is
becoming increasingly urgent.  Steps are now being taken to remedy those
reductions.  Several United Nations funding agencies are supporting initiatives
being taken at both the national and global levels.  One example is the World
Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), whose overall objective is to
contribute to the improvement of national and regional water resource assessment
capabilities.  The initiative is already under way in countries of the
Mediterranean basin and southern Africa, and projects for other African regions
and the Caribbean are in the pipeline.  The International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), in cooperation with the World Meterological Organization (WMO) and the
International Geosphere/Biosphere Programme (IGBP), is strengthening the
operation of the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP).  GNIP has
accumulated more than 220,000 items of data from 505 meteorological stations in
some 80 countries.  IAEA also assists countries in the management of water
resources through the integration of isotope methods with other hydrological
techniques.  The assistance includes capacity-building and the implementation of
water resource assessment programmes in member States.  The need to strengthen
hydrological networks is also being addressed in the United Nations System-wide
Special Initiative on Africa.


                 C.  Protection of water resources, water quality
                     and aquatic ecosystems

7.   The development, application and surveillance of drinking-water quality
guidelines and progress in the eradication of dracunculiasis are clearly two of
the most important success stories in this area of chapter 18.  Community
intervention in preventing the contamination of water sources, the use of
filters and chemical treatment have brought a 97 per cent reduction in
dracunculiasis as of December 1995.  The link between inappropriate water
resource development and other vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and
schistosomiasis, is also widely recognized.

8.   The Joint World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO)/United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/Centre
for Human Settlements (Habitat) Panel of Experts on Environmental Management for
Vector Control (PEEM) has been promoting the application of environmental
management for the control of disease vectors in agricultural development
projects.  It also prepares guideline documents, conducts national workshops and
training courses, and supports country-level pilot and demonstration projects. 
A thorough international assessment of the risks to human health from exposure
to microbial and chemical contaminants in drinking water was conducted after
UNCED, and recommended guidelines were published in 1993.  Health criteria and
other supporting information were published in 1996.  The guidelines provided
the basis for introducing updated national drinking-water standards in many
member States.  Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of
water-quality monitoring programmes worldwide, for many international river
basins, such as the Danube, the Mekong, the Plate and the Nile, now covered by
multilaterally agreed monitoring networks.  Further, the global and regional
monitoring efforts of the United Nations Environment Programme Global
Environment Monitoring System (GEMS)/Water Programme provide water-quality data
and information for both assessment and management purposes.  The receipt of
monitoring data from national water-quality laboratories and authorities also
suggests that capacities have been improved in a number of countries. 


                     D.  Drinking-water supply and sanitation

9.   It is estimated that, since the beginning of the 1990s, an additional
800 million people have been provided with a supply of safe water and the total
number of people without access fell by almost 500 million.  No reliable global
inferences are possible concerning increases in sanitation services over the
same period, because of the use of significantly more stringent criteria through
time regarding what constitutes safe sanitation.  It appears, however, that
progress in the expansion of sanitation coverage has not been very significant. 
In spite of an acceleration in the rate of progress over previous decades, it is
estimated that at least another 1,100 million people remain unserved and the
number of people without access to sanitation has increased to a total of almost
3,000 million.  One major reason for optimism, however, is evidence that many
countries have started to integrate their drinking-water supply and sanitation
programmes more closely into their water resource development strategies and
their environmental protection planning.  As a result, increasing attention has
been paid to the potential health, environmental and socio-economic benefits of
effective water resource planning, development and management and to the crucial
roles of women and community.


                    E.  Water and sustainable urban development

10.  National and city authorities are still finding it difficult to cope with
rapidly increasing urban populations.  In the developing countries, during the
first half of the 1990s, an additional 170 million urban dwellers were provided
with safe water and 70 million with appropriate sanitation.  However, because of
rapid urban population growth, about 300 million urban residents still lacked
access to safe water supply, while close to 600 million lacked adequate
sanitation at the end of 1994.  While the number of urban dwellers with access
to safe water in Africa and in Latin America increased by 20 million and
70 million, respectively, between 1990 and 1994, the percentage of people served
actually fell in both regions during the same period, because of rapid urban
population growth.  Similarly, the situation concerning urban sanitation and
pollution from urban waste gives cause for concern and, in the case of Africa,
for outright alarm.  The current rate of service expansion is, in fact,
insufficient to prevent an increase in the number of dwellers without access to
at least minimum standards of sanitation in all developing country regions. 

11.  Nevertheless, there are still several reasons for optimism, including the
fact that, since UNCED, a number of countries have begun to implement policies
and programmes related to major activities specified in chapter 18.  In
addition, several joint activities by various United Nations organizations have
been undertaken to create awareness and build regional and national capacity on
the treatment and safe use of municipal wastewater in agriculture and
aquaculture.  The launching of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative
on Africa and the Habitat Agenda 3/ provide further reason for optimism.  A
consultation including governmental leaders, private developers, leading
non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations, to be held in
March 1997, is expected to speed up the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in
Africa.


          F.  Water for sustainable food production and rural development

12.  A key objective of this priority area is assisting member States to achieve
food security, sustainable agriculture and rural development through efficient
and effective water resource development and management.  Progress achieved on
this key objective is related to the implementation of several initiatives, such
as national action programmes, water policy review and reform, promotion of
increased water-use efficiency, irrigation expansion in support of food security
and irrigation technology transfer.  Several national action programmes on water
for sustainable agricultural development have been formulated and are beginning
to be implemented in a number of countries and regions, such as China, Egypt,
Indonesia, Mexico, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Republic of Tanzania,
Zimbabwe and the Lake Chad basin.  Water for sustainable agricultural
development is an "upstream activity" which focuses on water-sector and
irrigation subsectoral reviews, irrigation policies and strategies, irrigation
master planning and project proposals to address technology adaptation,
environmental protection and national capacity-building.  It is, however, too
early to judge the success or failure of such initiatives, although there are
reasons for optimism.  Despite economic hardships, water scarcity and
environmental concerns, irrigation acreage has continued to expand in developing
countries, although at a slower rate than in previous decades.  In many
developing countries, national Governments have allocated a relatively high
proportion of their development budget to irrigation expansion and the
modernization of existing projects.  It is evident that many countries are
embarking on national water resource planning as a means to resolve
intersectoral competition for water and to deal with water scarcity.  Other
favourable trends include the transfer of irrigation management responsibilities
to farmers, the enhanced role of farmers and communities on decisions relating
to irrigation management, and private-sector involvement in irrigation
development.

13.  Aquaculture continues to be the fastest growing system for the production
of fish protein and is now interacting seriously with the environment.  This
calls for increased assessment and monitoring of its environmental impacts.  FAO
has elaborated an agreed Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which
includes provisions for both aquaculture and inland fishery management.4/  


                          III.  UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS

             A.  Integrated water resource development and management

14.  Major impediments to the implementation of chapter 18 exist largely because
of the fragmentation of responsibilities and mandates for water resource
management and the somewhat inferior status of water-related activities in
relation to other sectoral activities.  The practical realities facing many
Governments in developing countries, some with extremely limited water resource
bases and most with inadequate institutional arrangements, pose several
constraints for the effective introduction of integrated water resource
management.  Most developing countries have, for reasons of finance and
capacity, difficulties extending water-related services and managing and
regulating water resource use.  In addition, many countries lack adequate
legislation and policies aimed at the efficient and equitable allocation and use
of water resources.  Another serious constraint is that water resource planning
is rarely integrated into national macroeconomic planning.  Moreover, in spite
of the importance of women in environmental protection and development, their
participation in the planning and management of water resources is far from the
desired level.  Water resource planning, development and management have
sometimes had unexpected side effects due to lack of consultation and
participation at the local level, particularly from women, user associations and
community groups.


           B.  Water resource assessment and the impact of climate
               change on water resources

15.  The fragmentation of institutional responsibilities and the low level of
priority given to water resource assessment at the national level are widely
recognized as an impediment to the establishment of integrated national
databases.  The lack of financial and human resources also continue to be major
constraints to improving water resources assessment, particularly in developing
countries.  Recent cutbacks have taken their toll both in terms of the poor
operation and maintenance of networks, and the availability and lack of
reliability of water information.  The lack of sufficient and reliable data on
water availability, its use and quality in many areas of the world makes
effective national, regional and global water resource assessment difficult, if
not impractical.  A problem common to many countries is that of training and
retaining water resource assessment staff and updating their abilities to
implement more advanced technologies and use modern equipment.  From a global
perspective, there is serious concern about the ability of the national agencies
that are responsible for water resource assessment to meet the growing needs for
data and information, especially as they relate to sustainable development.


               C.  Protection of water resources, water quality and
                   aquatic ecosystems

16.  There is a global concern over the deterioration in water quality, which is
rapidly reducing the potable water resource base.  Our scientific understanding
of the processes is far from adequate.  Water-quality databases are very
limited, restricting development of the models required for the application of
land and water management guidelines within the framework of water pollution and
environmental health.  The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation
for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-
recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment,
protection of water sources, cleaning up polluted water and other essential
measures.  Continuous international funding will be required to maintain the
momentum in dracunculiasis eradication, given that the required monitoring and
certification process is beyond the means of the countries still affected by the
disease.  Despite the progress achieved in water quality monitoring, knowledge
on global, regional and subregional scales is considerably less than that on
water quantity.  This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting
materials being discharged into receiving waters, inadequate knowledge about the
pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants, the need for expensive and
sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants, and insufficient
knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants,
particularly synthetic organic materials.


                     D.  Drinking-water supply and sanitation

17.  One of the main constraints in this area remains the dispersed nature of
the responsibility for the protection of health and the environment and
inadequate policies and mechanisms for efficient and equitable allocation of
water resources among competing users, particularly in circumstances where water
is relatively scarce.  The lack of education/training, public awareness,
promotional campaigns, low-cost affordable and appropriate techniques, adequate
financial resources and, in particular, pricing policies aiming at generating
funds to cover at least operation and maintenance, is also a serious problem in
most countries.  Another obvious constraint to water resource protection has
been the low priority given to sanitation, which is highlighted by the
significant increase in the number of unserved people.  One innovative way of
dealing with the problem, besides greater investments in sanitation and
treatment, is to promote increased awareness through health and hygiene
education/training of various target groups, primarily women and children, and
behavioural change.  In addition, with regard to rural sanitation, little
progress in expansion can be achieved without integrating sectoral policies into
poverty alleviation schemes and rural development strategies.


                    E.  Water and sustainable urban development

18.  Rapid urbanization in developing countries and the lack of integrated
planning and management of water resources and environmental infrastructure
services has been one of the major constraints to achieving the main targets for
this programme area.  Investments in water supply, sanitation, drainage and
solid waste management services are well below the required levels.  Most
developing countries still depend on insufficient public funds for investments
in the sector.  In addition, the user charges levied are usually inadequate to
cover operation and maintenance costs, let alone investment costs.  Lack of
security of tenure resulting from bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining land
titles in peri-urban or slum areas has also been an important factor behind the
lack of investment in such areas, while lack of community involvement in the
decision-making process has resulted in many wrong decisions about priorities
and the levels of services required.  In addition, long-held misconceptions
about the inability and unwillingness of the urban poor to pay for water supply
and sanitation has been a major constraint to the introduction of appropriate
pricing policies which promote efficient water use and the financial autonomy of
water companies.  Inadequate operation and maintenance of networks and
installations reduces the life of assets and has resulted in large amounts of
water unaccounted for, due to leakages and illegal connections.  Public-sector
institutions responsible for service provision have proven inefficient, lacking
transparency and accountability.  Because of inadequate remuneration, they have
been unable to attract or retain trained personnel, which has significantly
affected their ability to manage urban water resources and services.


          F.  Water for sustainable food production and rural development

19.  In many countries, fragmented institutional structures, notably in
agriculture, water and environmental ministries or agencies, remain a major
constraint.  The implementation of important economic instruments, designed to
improve water use efficiency, such as, water pricing, water markets and cost-
recovery schemes, continues to face serious obstacles throughout the world. 
Another frequent problem is inadequate funding support for investment and
technical assistance in irrigation, from both internal sources and donor
countries or institutions.  Some countries have well formulated irrigation
expansion and rehabilitation projects that require supplementary donor funding
for their effective implementation which is not available or forthcoming.  On
the other hand, funding is often unavailable because many irrigation projects
throughout the world are characterized by heavy subsidization and poor rates of
performance.  Despite huge investments and subsidies, irrigation performance
indicators are falling short of expectations throughout the world.  In addition,
inland fisheries production has fallen drastically over the past decade in many
areas because of pollution and environmental modification of waterways. 
Aquaculture is also experiencing some local problems with availability of water,
and in some cases expansion is hampered by the need to conform to regulations
regarding the quality of effluents.


                             IV.  EMERGING PRIORITIES

20.  The world faces many challenges over the use of the environment as a source
of natural resources and as a sink for wastes.  As the comprehensive assessment
of the freshwater resources of the world concludes, water must be considered one
of the most vital issues facing future human use of the environment.  Major
issues, such as climatic change, deforestation, protection of biodiversity and
desertification, are all linked to water resource management.  The present
situation and current trends are likely to have particularly serious
implications in terms of economic development and food production.  Unless
managed with a view to achieving efficiency and equity, water resources could
become a serious limiting factor to socio-economic development in many
developing countries.  Since many of the negative trends in water resources
management will take years or decades to reverse, it is imperative that actions
to reverse them begin immediately.


             A.  Integrated water resource development and management

21.  There are at least five important principles without which the path to
achieving the goals of integrated water resource development and management will
remain blocked.  First is the need to establish a process of open and
transparent consultation in discussing water resource issues.  This involves
building bridges between technocratic and often centralized water institutions
and the much more diffuse set of water users in rural and urban settings. 
Secondly, there is an urgent need to separate regulatory and operational
functions.  It is now increasingly accepted that an independent water authority,
in charge of defining policy and strategies for all water uses, is a sound means
for implementing integrated water resource management.  Thirdly, the role of
legislation should basically be to enable rather than restrict integrated water
resource management.  It can be argued that a system of stable and identifiable
water and land rights will, particularly in relation to irrigation, tend to
increase productivity and conservation of water resources.  Equally, recognition
of customary uses and water rights might enhance trust in governmental
activities and programmes.  Fourthly, more emphasis needs to be put on demand
management and, in particular, water-pricing, as a way to promote efficient
water use and generate funds for the operation and expansion of existing
facilities.  Fifthly, as stated in the Programme of Action of the Fourth World
Conference on Women,5/ it is important to ensure that policy makers and planners
recognize the benefits of including women in water resource planning,
development and management. 

22.  At the international level, priority should be given to the successful
completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework
convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and
rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those
principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse
and the needs of the States concerned.  The draft articles on the law of
non-navigable [non-navigational] uses of international watercourses, adopted by
the International Law Commission (ILC) in 1994 have been recommended as the
basis for a convention on the subject by ILC.  In March 1997, the General
Assembly will reconvene a working group of the whole to continue the work
started in October 1996 on the elaboration of a framework convention on the
basis of the draft articles adopted by ILC. 


           B.  Water resource assessment and the impact of climate change
               on water resources

23.  Pooling resources among countries, particularly within international river
basins, is one way to improve water resource assessment.  The expansion of the
above-mentioned WHYCOS initiative and its regional observing systems is a
possible solution to the problem of inadequate water resource assessment in many
countries and regions.  More funding (from both internal and external sources)
will also be required for improvements in capability at the national and
river-basin level, including human resource development and institutional
capacity-building.  As regards the impact of climate change on water resources,
the projections of the recently published second assessment of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) state that the hydrological
cycle will intensify with global warming.6/  This could lead to more severe
droughts in some areas and catastrophic flooding in others.  The IPCC's best
estimates of a likely rise of 50 centimetres in average sea level by the end of
the twenty-first century will result in salt-water intrusions affecting coastal
cities and heavily populated delta regions.  Data collection and monitoring
systems will need to be geared specifically to these issues.

               C.  Protection of water resources, water quality and
                   aquatic ecosystems

24.  There is need for Governments to enhance their water-quality monitoring and
assessment programmes.  Sustained socio-economic development requires accurate
information on the quality and quantity of freshwater resources and on the
coastal areas into which they ultimately drain.  Such efforts, at first glance,
are expensive and time-consuming, with no immediate payoffs.  Nevertheless,
without such information, nations could easily make development decisions with
costly, sometimes even catastrophic, consequences over the long term.  For
example, safeguarding and improving the quality of drinking water requires
intensive backstopping of the national health, water and environmental
authorities through advisory services, expert consultant services and
intersectoral training programmes.  This situation had a precedent in the 1960s,
when recognition of an insufficient understanding of global hydrology for water
resource management prompted proclamation by UNESCO of the International
Hydrological Decade (IHD), 1965-1974.  That global programme set up through
United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the
national level in many countries, facilitated the establishment of a network of
representative basins, improving understanding of hydrology and water resource
management.  In a cooperative effort by UNESCO, UNEP and the United Nations
University, a comprehensive water-quality programme is being developed.  It is
to be based on a global network of representative drainage basins, encompassing
the broad spectrum of environments, to allow future extrapolation to unmonitored
basins. 


                     D.  Drinking-water supply and sanitation

25.  In urban areas, the ultimate solution will be to integrate water supply and
sanitation services for the peri-urban poor with the established urban systems. 
This will require the full physical integration of those systems and the
assignment of responsibilities to the appropriate urban utilities.  It will also
require the establishment of an enabling environment for the financial and
administrative autonomy of water and sanitation utilities and for institutional
capacity-building.  More research and information exchange is required on
innovative technical and administrative approaches.  With regard to rural water
supply and sanitation, the challenge is to maintain at least the progress
reported to date and, in particular, to strengthen the household water supply
component of rural development and agricultural projects.  In addition, more
responsibility has to be delegated for rural sanitation to the local level, with
corresponding budget allocations and accountability, with particular emphasis on
community participation, self-reliance and the central role of women in water
resource management.  Emphasis should be given to a gradual introduction of
economic mechanisms aimed at ensuring that rural water supply becomes
self-financing, at least in terms of operation and maintenance.  At the same
time, additional external funding will also be required for the expansion or
improvement of water supply and sanitation facilities, particularly in
developing countries.  The issue of sustainable water use and sanitation supply
demands high priority at the country level. It is thus encouraging to note that
the countries of the African region have established the Africa 2000 Initiative
for Water Supply and Sanitation and have proposed that it be linked to the
United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.


                    E.  Water and sustainable urban development

26.  The Habitat Agenda 2/ calls for an integrated approach to water resource
management and the links between water, sanitation and health, between the
economy and the environment, and between cities and their hinterlands.  There is
a need to further strengthen the capacities of national and city authorities to
provide the right legal and regulatory framework for the participation of all
stakeholders, including women, in the planning, provision and management of
services.  Planning should be at the water-basin level and should consider both
short and long-term needs of all uses and users of water resources. 
Public/private partnerships and community participation in decision-making,
service provision and management should be encouraged.  Private-sector funds
should be sought to bridge the widening supply/demand gap, and tenure issues in
peri-urban areas should be regularized so as to encourage investments.  Adequate
tariff levels should be charged, in order to recover investment, operation and
maintenance costs, with mechanisms to ensure that the needs of the poor are
adequately catered to.  Strategies for demand management and control of wastage
should be promoted in order to reduce the amount of unaccounted for water and
discourage wasteful use, as a first alternative to investments in new
installations.  Pollution control should be more vigorously pursued, inter alia,
through economic instruments of pollution abatement.


          F.  Water for sustainable food production and rural development

27.  As a matter of priority, irrigation development should be addressed on a
more systematic basis.  There is a need for better designed projects at the
national level, with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and
economic performance, together with policies aimed at creating an environment
that encourages private-sector investment (internal and external) and donor
support.  The challenge is to move towards means of irrigation that are
economically more efficient or crops that are less water-intensive - that is, to
produce more food with less water so that more water can be transferred to
higher-value uses.  More emphasis should be given to rainfed agriculture, and
more efficient economic alternatives to irrigated agriculture.  While developing
countries should demonstrate their willingness and ability to make irrigation
economically sound and environmentally viable, technical assistance programmes
should also be better designed and "tailor-made" to individual country needs.
Broadly speaking, the programmes should focus on national policy review and
reform, including institutional mechanisms to implement economic and
environmental principles, and on building national capacity so that the
countries will be able to design, implement, operate and maintain their
irrigation systems in a sustainable manner.  Given that water management for
sustainable food production and food security goes beyond the farm boundaries,
it is also essential to integrate agricultural strategies into broader regional
and rural development strategies.  Emphasis should be given to the central role
of local communities and, particularly, to women, not only in rural water
resource planning, development and management but also in small-scale
agriculture as a source of income and local food self-sufficiency.

28.  Inland fisheries can be conserved only in a framework of basin planning
where the elements needed for the survival of the fish are guaranteed, such as
in-stream flow needs, channel diversity, wetland conservation etc.  Further
growth of aquaculture will depend on further information on risks to the
environment.  Much risk can be avoided by development and dissemination of more
efficient use of water, improved feeds and more efficient water treatment
systems.
