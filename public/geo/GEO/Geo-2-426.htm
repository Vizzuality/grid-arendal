                    <LI><FONT size=+1>On target to protect 12 percent of the 
                    province:</FONT> Protecting an additional 48,500 hectares of 
                    Clayoquot Sound contributes significantly to the 
                    government's goal of effectively doubling B.C.'s parks and 
                    wilderness by preserving 12 percent of the important 
                    representative ecological systems throughout the 
                    province.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>33 percent of Sound now permanently 
                    protected:</FONT> Includes four of its major unlogged 
                    forests and its entire outer coastline. Another 17 percent 
                    will be placed under special management, which allows for 
                    some timber harvesting but protects wildlife, recreation and 
                    scenic landscape values.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Previous timber rights taken back:</FONT> 
                    Instead of the more than 80 percent awarded to MacBlo and 
                    other logging companies by previous B.C. governments, we 
                    have taken back a significant amount of timber rights and 
                    reduced the area dedicated to logging to approximately 45 
                    percent. And on these limited lands available for logging, 
                    we are setting sound harvesting and environmental 
                    standards.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>1,000 hectares only to be cut each 
                    year:</FONT> Along with these standards and 
                    performance-based enforcement, harvesting will proceed at a 
                    rate of only about 1,000 hectares per year in small 
                    dispersed cutblocks and will be spread out over an 80 to 100 
                    year rotation. These cutblocks will be reforested on average 
                    within three to five years following harvest.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>More than half of old growth saved:</FONT> 
                    B.C. now has one of the largest areas of protected old 
                    growth rainforest on the west coast of North America, with 
                    Strathcona Park effectively extended to the ocean. There are 
                    nine primary watersheds over 1,000 hectares in size in 
                    Clayoquot Sound which are still in pristine condition and 
                    contain most of the old growth timber. The land-use decision 
                    permanently protects about 54 percent - more than half of 
                    the total area of these unlogged watersheds.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Biodiversity protected:</FONT> In effect 
                    28,000 hectares have been added to Strathcona Park, linking 
                    the interior mountains of Vancouver Island to the ocean 
                    shore. As the principle of island biogeography generally 
                    states that the larger the area, the greater the diversity 
                    of species and habitats, this newly protected reserve will 
                    foster the maintenance of biological diversity in this 
                    ecoregion. Other newly protected areas, such as Clayoquot 
                    Plateau, are also home to rare plant species and unique 
                    geographical features.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Special management areas protect other 
                    values:</FONT> Of the 17 percent placed under special 
                    management, the vast majority (15 percent of the total land 
                    base) is designated to cover scenic corridors. Landscape 
                    management plans will ensure the key scenic landscape values 
                    important to tourism and recreation are not compromised. 
                    These areas now encompass virtually every kilometre of 
                    inland coastline, while the entire 78 kilometres of outer 
                    coastline is protected absolutely.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Harvest levels cut standards 
                    improved:</FONT> The estimated new harvest level will be 
                    reduced by about 300,000 cubic metres annually (a 33 percent 
                    reduction), to a sustainable level of 600,000 cubic metres 
                    per year. Harvesting plans will incorporate smaller 
                    dispersed cut blocks, moving away from large scale clear 
                    cuts. A commitment has been made to specific logging 
                    standards for sensitive areas, including an emphasis on 
                    skyline and helicopter harvesting to reduce road densities 
                    and mid-slope roads.<BR>
                    <P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Protection comes at significant economic 
                    cost:</FONT> The jobs of an estimated 1,000 men and women 
                    will be lost, including nearly 500 in the Alberni-Clayoquot 
                    area. Taking away MacBlo and other forest company timber 
                    rights means a $46 million per year reduction in B.C.'s 
                    gross domestic product, and an additional $7.6 million in 
                    annual resource and tax revenue lost to the public treasury.

                    <LI><FONT size=+1>Local land-use process respected:</FONT> 
                    When CORE was announced on January 21, 1992, we said 
                    Clayoquot would remain outside CORE in order to continue the 
                    extensive work already done by the Clayoquot Sound 
                    Sustainable Development Steering Committee. We didn't want 
                    to alter any of the conditions under which this local 
                    land-use process was operating as it worked to put together 
                    its recommendations. Our land-use decision builds on 
                    extensive information collected during that process and 
                    comes after wide public input. <BR></LI></OL>
