      <P><A name=Purpose></A><B>Purpose</B></P>
      <P>In keeping with the objective of the <I>Revised Great Lakes Water 
      Quality Agreement of 1978, as amended by Protocol signed November 18, 
      1987</I> (1987 GLWQA) to restore and protect the Great Lakes, the purpose 
      of this binational strategy (the Strategy) is to set forth a collaborative 
      process by which Environment Canada (EC) and the United States 
      Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), in consultation with other 
      federal departments and agencies, Great Lakes states, the Province of 
      Ontario, Tribes, and First Nations, will work in cooperation with their 
      public and private partners toward the goal of virtual elimination of 
      persistent toxic substances resulting from human activity, particularly 
      those which bioaccumulate, from the Great Lakes Basin, so as to protect 
      and ensure the health and integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem. In cases 
      where this Strategy addresses a naturally-occurring substance, it is the 
      anthropogenic sources of pollution that, when warranted, will be targeted 
      for reduction through a life-cycle management approach so as to achieve 
      naturally-occurring levels. An underlying tenet of this Strategy is that 
      the governments cannot by their actions alone achieve the goal of virtual 
      elimination. This Strategy challenges all sectors of society to 
      participate and cooperate to ensure success. The goal of virtual 
      elimination will be achieved through a variety of programs and actions, 
      but the primary emphasis of this Strategy will be on pollution prevention. 
      This Strategy reaffirms the two countries' commitment to the sound 
      management of chemicals, as stated in <I>Agenda 21: A Global Action Plan 
      for the 21st Century</I> and adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference 
      on Environment and Development. The Strategy will also be guided by the 
      principles articulated by the International Joint Commission's (IJC) 
      Virtual Elimination Task Force (VETF) in the <I>Seventh Biennial Report on 
      Great Lakes Quality</I>. This Strategy has been developed under the 
      auspices of the Binational Executive Committee (BEC), which is charged 
      with coordinating the implementation of the binational aspects of the 1987 
      GLWQA. The BEC is co-chaired by EC and USEPA, and includes members of the 
      Great Lakes states, the Province of Ontario, and other federal departments 
      and agencies in Canada and the United States (U.S.). </P>
      <P><A name="Environmental Context"></A><B>Environmental Context</B> </P>
      <P>The Great Lakes are an extraordinary natural endowment, holding 18 
      percent of the world's supply of surface fresh water. They are home to 33 
      million people, 47 percent of whom draw their drinking water from the 
      Lakes. The Great Lakes are also vital to many North American fish and 
      wildlife species. Their wealth of natural resources has long made the 
      region a heartland of economic strength. </P>
      <P>During the 1970s, it became apparent that pollution caused by 
      persistent toxic substances was harming Great Lakes species and posing 
      risks to human and wildlife consumers of fish. Accordingly, under the 
      <I>Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978</I>, the U.S. and Canada 
      pledged to seek the virtual elimination of the discharge of persistent 
      toxic substances to the Great Lakes. </P>
      <P>The risks to human, fish and wildlife health came to the fore again 
      during the 1980s when public attention became focused on the Niagara River 
      and Lake Ontario. These concerns led to the negotiation and signing, 
      separate from the 1987 GLWQA, of the four-party <I>Niagara River 
      Declaration of Intent</I> (DOI) in 1987, and the development of the Lake 
      Ontario Toxics Management Plan, which has been incorporated into the Lake 
      Ontario Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP) program. </P>
      <P>The 1987 GLWQA established a process, set of commitments, and general 
      principles for developing and implementing Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) 
      for geographic Areas of Concern (AOCs) and LaMPs. </P>
      <P>In 1991, in response to a recommendation from the IJC, the governments 
      of Canada, the U.S., Michigan, Minnesota, Ontario and Wisconsin developed 
      the Binational Program to Restore and Protect the Lake Superior Basin 
      (Binational Program). The purpose of the Binational Program was to protect 
      the high quality waters of the Lake Superior Basin, to restore degraded 
      areas therein, and to achieve zero discharge of designated persistent and 
      bioaccumulative toxic substances from point sources in the Basin. </P>
      <P>In 1994, the <I>Canada-Ontario Agreement Respecting the Great Lakes 
      Basin Ecosystem</I> (COA) was established to ensure implementation of the 
      requirements of the 1987 GLWQA. In 1995, in the U.S., the final <I>Water 
      Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System</I> (GLI) was published, 
      establishing a process for developing consistent water quality standards 
      across the Great Lakes system. The Strategy builds on and complements all 
      of these efforts. </P>
      <P>Significant successes in reducing persistent toxic substances in the 
      Great Lakes include cleanup of contaminated sediment sites at Great Lakes 
      harbors, reduced levels of PCBs, dioxins and DDT, and improved sport 
      fisheries. Researchers have also observed an increase in the number of 
      certain wildlife species (e.g., eagles and cormorants). </P>
      <P>Even with the important accomplishments in toxics reduction achieved by 
      the RAPs, the LaMPs, the Niagara River DOI and the Binational Program over 
      the past decade, and the actions taken by both countries to ban, cancel, 
      and restrict the use of a number of persistent toxic substances, these 
      substances continue to be present in the Great Lakes ecosystem. For 
      example, contaminated bottom sediments pollute certain harbors, impeding 
      navigational dredging and the economic potential for use of these waters. 
      Unacceptable levels of PCBs, methyl mercury, and toxaphene require the 
      continued issuance of fish consumption advisories, suppressing the 
      economic potential of the region's fisheries industries and presenting a 
      continued human health risk. More recently, there has been growing public 
      concern about, and active government investigation into, toxic pollutants 
      that may produce non-cancerous health effects in wildlife and in humans, 
      including reproductive and hormonal disruption and learning disabilities. 
      </P>
      <P>The continuing presence of these persistent toxic substances is the 
      result of atmospheric deposition, release from contaminated bottom 
      sediments, releases from various industrial processes, releases from 
      non-point sources, and continuous cycling of naturally-occurring and 
      anthropogenic substances within the Great Lakes themselves. In some cases, 
      there may also be illegal or accidental discharge of stored substances for 
      which production and use has previously been cancelled or banned. All of 
      these factors highlight the need for more to be done. </P>
      <P>This Strategy acknowledges and builds on the existing Canadian and U.S. 
      regulatory programs which address the targeted substances. In Canada, 
      these include the programs under the Canadian Environmental Protection 
      Act, the Fisheries Act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the 
      Pest Control Products Act, the Ontario Environmental Protection Act, the 
      Ontario Water Resources Act, the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act, and 
      an array of other federal and provincial acts which bear on protection of 
      the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem from the polluting effects of these 
      substances. In the U.S., these include the Comprehensive Environmental 
      Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and 
      Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances 
      Control Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and 
      other regulatory programs. Both countries acknowledge that more needs to 
      be done. </P>
      <P>The "unfinished business" of virtually eliminating persistent toxic 
      substances in the Great Lakes Basin remains a significant challenge. To 
      contribute to the resolution of this problem, more strategic and 
      coordinated interventions are required at various geographic scales, from 
      the local watershed/AOC to the lakewide, basin-wide, national, and 
      international arenas. Movement of persistent toxic substances does not 
      respect jurisdictional or geographic borders. In particular, the 
      inter-basin transfer of persistent toxic substances from one lake to 
      another and the short- and long-range movement and deposition of these 
      substances from the air have compelled EC and USEPA to develop this 
      coordinated binational Strategy. </P>
      <P>The Strategy is intended to encourage ongoing programs or emerging 
      initiatives to better address toxic releases; to provide a context of 
      basin-wide goals for localized actions; and to provide "out of basin" 
      support to Great Lakes Basin programs such as LaMPs and RAPs.</P>
      <P><A name="Approach to Virtual Elimination"></A><B>Approach to Virtual 
      Elimination</B> </P>
      <P>In Article II(a) of the 1987 GLWQA, the two countries agreed that 
      "...the discharge of any and all persistent toxic substances be virtually 
      eliminated" and agreed to develop programs and measures to implement the 
      GLWQA, including "measures for the control of inputs of persistent toxic 
      substances including control programs for their production, use, 
      distribution, and disposal..." (GLWQA, Article VI (k)). To accomplish this 
      objective, the IJC in 1990 urged the Parties to develop and implement "a 
      comprehensive, binational program to lessen the uses of, and exposure to 
      persistent toxic chemicals found in the Great Lakes environment." In their 
      response to the IJC's <I>Seventh Biennial Report on Great Lakes Water 
      Quality</I>, both the U.S. and Canada reaffirmed their commitment to work 
      on such a binational Strategy, to promote implementation of commitments in 
      the 1987 GLWQA. Since that time, both countries have undertaken their own 
      virtual elimination efforts, Canada through its Toxic Substances 
      Management Policy (TSMP), and the U.S. through its Virtual Elimination 
      Pilot Project. </P>
      <P>In February 1995, Prime Minister Chrétien and President Clinton 
      confirmed the commitment by the U.S. and Canada to work together to 
      develop a binational strategy to address the most persistent toxic 
      substances in the Great Lakes environment. The two countries prepared this 
      Strategy, building on past and ongoing virtual elimination efforts in the 
      Basin, including the extensive work by the IJC in its framework outlined 
      in the VETF report. The Strategy also incorporates suggestions, ideas and 
      concepts embodied in the 6th and 7th IJC Biennial Reports. </P>
      <P>This Strategy will follow the framework outlined in <I>Agenda 21: A 
      Global Action Plan for the 21st Century</I> and adopted at the 1992 United 
      Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In this framework, the 
      U.S. and Canada (and other nations) committed, where appropriate to:
      <UL>
        <P><I>undertake concerted activities to reduce risks for toxic 
        chemicals, taking into account the entire life-cycle of the chemicals. 
        These activities could encompass both regulatory and non-regulatory 
        measures, such as promotion of the use of cleaner products and 
        technologies; emission inventories; product labeling; use limitations; 
        economic incentives; and the phasing out or banning of toxic chemicals 
        that pose an unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risk to human 
        health and the environment, including those that are toxic, persistent 
        and bioaccumulative and whose use cannot be adequately controlled; and 
        </I></P>
        <P><I>adopt policies and regulatory and non-regulatory measures to 
        identify, and minimize exposure to, toxic chemicals by replacing them 
        with less toxic substitutes and ultimately phasing out the chemicals 
        that pose unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risk to human health 
        and the environment and those that are toxic, persistent and 
        bioaccumulative and whose use cannot be adequately controlled.</I> 
      </P></UL>
      <P>This concept of Virtual Elimination, as acknowledged by the IJC and for 
      purposes of this Strategy, also recognizes that it may not be possible to 
      achieve total elimination of all persistent toxic substances -- some may 
      be produced by, or as a result of natural processes and so may persist at 
      background or "natural" levels. In addition, total or complete elimination 
      may not be possible for technological or economic reasons. In cases where 
      the Strategy addresses a naturally-occurring substance, it is the 
      anthropogenic sources of pollution of that particular substance which, 
      when warranted, will be targeted for reduction through a life-cycle 
      management approach so as to achieve naturally-occurring levels. To 
      accomplish the objective of restoring and maintaining the integrity of the 
      Great Lakes, the Strategy seeks to reduce and virtually eliminate the 
      input of persistent toxic substances to the Great Lakes<SUP><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>. Virtual 
      elimination will be sought within the most expedient time frame through 
      the most appropriate, common sense, practical and cost-effective blend of 
      voluntary, regulatory or incentive-based actions. All feasible options 
      will be considered, including pollution prevention, phase-outs and 
      bans<SUP><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>. </P>
      <P>Actions identified in this Strategy will be complemented by other 
      existing or proposed regulatory and non-regulatory initiatives. In 
      addition, it is anticipated that actions and challenges identified in this 
      document will evolve over time as information about opportunities, cost 
      effectiveness, and benefits becomes available. Virtual elimination may not 
      be achievable tomorrow, but the challenges and actions outlined in this 
      Strategy represent significant milestones on the path toward this goal. 
      </P>
      <P><A name="Analytical Framework"></A><B>Analytical Framework </B></P>
      <P>EC and the USEPA, in cooperation with their partners, will use a 
      four-step process to work toward virtual elimination. </P>
      <P>1. <U>Information gathering</U>
      <UL>
        <P>Identify to the extent feasible, the full range of sources, both 
        point and non-point, within and outside the Basin which release the 
        selected substances, by economic sector, and examine which sector(s) may 
        be contributing to the presence of the substance in the Basin. Within 
        each source, identify why and how the substance is used or released, 
        e.g., used as a product or released as a byproduct. This step may 
        include examining the entire life cycle of the substance, from initial 
        decision to use through eventual disposal. Also, specific 
        characteristics of a substance such as whether it is naturally 
        occurring, or whether its release results from human use, will be 
        considered. Information gaps and uncertainties as to sources, 
        multi-media loadings and associated impacts of specific substances will 
        be identified and actions recommended to address them. </P></UL>
      <P>2. <U>Analyze current regulations, initiatives and programs which 
      manage or control substances</U> 
      <UL>
        <P>Assess how existing laws, regulations and programs influence the 
        presence of these substances in the Basin, and their long-range 
        transport across states, provinces, regions and international borders. 
        Identify the gaps in these regulations, programs and initiatives that 
        offer opportunity for the most effective and appropriate reductions of 
        these substances. </P></UL>
      <P>3. <U>Identify cost-effective options to achieve further reductions</U> 

      <UL>
        <P>Identify options that may offer opportunities for new or modified 
        measures, including emission trading schemes, pollution prevention, or 
        other alternative approaches, which may speed up the pace or increase 
        the level of reductions, taking into account cost effectiveness. </P></UL>
      <P>4. <U>Implement actions to work toward the goal of virtual 
      elimination</U> 
      <UL>
        <P>Using cost-effective measures, recommend and implement actions that 
        work toward the goal of virtual elimination, consistent with the 
        approach outlined in this Strategy. </P></UL>
      <P>With respect to some substances, EC and USEPA have already taken one or 
      more of these steps, as discussed further in <B><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#Technical Support Document Attachment 1">Attachment 
      1</A></B>. </P>
      <P><A name=Principles></A><B>Principles</B> </P>
      <P>This Strategy builds on the framework adopted by Canada and the U.S. 
      and other countries around the world in Chapter 19 of Agenda 21 on 
      Environmentally Sound Management of Toxic Chemicals, and the principles 
      advanced by the IJC's VETF for a virtual elimination strategy. Therefore, 
      it is agreed that in implementing this Strategy, EC and the USEPA, in 
      cooperation with their partners: 
      <UL>
        <LI>recognize that the Strategy substances do not respect international 
        boundaries; they pass between nations via the atmosphere, in shared 
        waters, and through trade or transboundary movement of products and 
        wastes. Therefore, the two nations cannot protect their citizens solely 
        through bilateral actions. Canada and the U.S. will work with other 
        nations to share scientific information and work with them toward 
        international accords to address these substances, where appropriate. 
        Some examples of the international efforts with which Canada and the 
        U.S. will be coordinating include: the development of a global agreement 
        on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), as called for in a recent 
        meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment 
        Programme (UNEP); the development of protocols on POPs and heavy metals 
        under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 
        Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP); 
        cooperative actions to implement the October 1995 Resolution on the 
        Sound Management of Chemicals developed by the Commission for 
        Environmental Cooperation (CEC) under the North American Agreement on 
        Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC); and other chemicals-related 
        activities under UNEP, the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety 
        (IFCS) and other bodies. <BR><BR>
        <LI>reaffirm their shared responsibility to work toward the goal of 
        virtual elimination and to recognize that the two countries' respective 
        domestic measures to achieve that goal must respect the institutional, 
        environmental and socio-economic context of each country. Each country 
        has discretion to include and act in accordance with its domestic 
        national policies in meeting the commitments of this Strategy, 
        recognizing the need for flexibility in determining how to meet these 
        commitments and the possibility that some actions and challenges will 
        evolve over time as information about opportunities, and their 
        associated costs and benefits becomes available. Canada and the U.S. are 
        free at all times to take actions and pursue targets more stringent than 
        those identified in this Strategy. Each country will build on the 
        efforts of states/provinces, industries and local communities, both 
        within and outside the Basin. <BR><BR>
        <LI>favor "cleaner, cheaper and smarter" ways to reduce the Strategy 
        substances, focusing on the best opportunities across a substance's life 
        to reduce its releases. EC and USEPA believe that pursuing a long-term, 
        phased strategy through prevention where possible and remediation when 
        necessary, is a common sense, practical approach to achieving 
        environmental objectives. <BR><BR>
        <LI>are committed to an open, interactive, public participation process, 
        which includes issuing regular progress reports to the public. While the 
        two federal governments must lead, they alone cannot achieve the goal of 
        virtual elimination. Other levels of government, industry and society as 
        a whole must share the responsibility to restore and maintain the health 
        of the Great Lakes Basin. <BR><BR>
        <LI>will collaborate in, and support voluntary initiatives by major use 
        and release sectors and others to reduce and eventually eliminate the 
        use, generation or release of Strategy substances. In the case of 
        naturally-occurring substances, collaborative efforts will consider 
        life-cycle management approaches to achieve the desired reductions. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P><A name="Scope and"></A><B>Scope and Effect</B> </P>
      <P>Recognizing that virtual elimination is a long-term objective, this 
      Strategy provides a framework to achieve specific actions from 1997 to 
      2006. These actions and goals represent milestones along the path to 
      virtual elimination. This Strategy embraces actions to reduce and 
      virtually eliminate persistent toxic substances resulting from human 
      activity, particularly those which bioaccumulate, that affect or have the 
      potential to affect the Great Lakes ecosystem, taking into account all 
      relevant factors. In cases where this Strategy addresses a 
      naturally-occurring substance, it is the anthropogenic sources of 
      pollution that, when warranted, will be targeted for reduction through a 
      life-cycle management approach so as to achieve naturally-occurring 
      levels. This Strategy reflects the firm commitment of Canada and the U.S. 
      to better focus and coordinate existing programs toward the goal of 
      virtual elimination of Strategy substances, without giving rise to legal 
      obligations on the governments or on the public. Nothing in this Strategy 
      affects the legal status of the 1987 GLWQA. </P>
      <P>The scope of the Strategy and its associated commitments and activities 
      will be focused primarily on the Great Lakes Basin. However, with respect 
      to atmospheric deposition, consistent with the provisions of Annex 15 of 
      the GLWQA, the traditional concept of the geographic area which impacts 
      the Basin will be expanded to recognize the long-range transport of 
      Strategy substances adversely affecting the quality of the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem. </P>
      <P>To facilitate the reductions envisaged in the Strategy, EC and USEPA 
      will work in cooperation with other responsible jurisdictions on a 
      national and international basis, to strengthen linkages to all existing 
      toxics reduction efforts, and to ensure that goals are harmonized and 
      actions are coordinated to achieve environmental progress. As part of this 
      task, EC and USEPA will work to coordinate efforts under the Strategy so 
      that they are complementary with other international efforts cited 
      earlier, such as efforts to develop LRTAP Convention Protocols on 
      Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals, the CEC Resolution 
      on the Sound Management of Chemicals, the UNEP and IFCS initiatives, and 
      the multilateral negotiations on POPs. </P>
      <P>This Strategy includes those actions undertaken jointly by EC, USEPA 
      and their partners, as well as those actions undertaken individually 
      through each nation's domestic programs and processes. </P>
      <P>Within the context of the Strategy, EC and USEPA will seek the 
      cooperation of their partners to address Strategy substances coming from 
      long-range transport outside the Basin that enter the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem, while supporting and building upon the ongoing processes in the 
      LaMPs and the RAPs to reduce "within basin" sources. It is expected that 
      the LaMPs and RAPs will make important contributions to the goal of 
      virtual elimination and will provide means to identify opportunities to 
      achieve "within-basin" load reductions. The individual LaMPs will be 
      focused on those chemicals that are of concern in that particular basin, 
      and those which have the potential to migrate to other lakes or waterways; 
      the LaMP reduction targets may also be more stringent than those in the 
      Strategy. Reductions achieved through within-basin efforts will be very 
      important to meeting the challenges, and helping to ensure the success, of 
      this Strategy. </P>
      <P>EC and USEPA recognize that many "critical pollutant" lists exist. For 
      purposes of this Strategy, they have chosen to focus actions first on 
      those substances that have been identified for priority action by multiple 
      screening criteria and processes (see <B><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#Appendix I">Appendix 
      I</A></B>). In essence, these are substances that are present in the 
      water, sediment or aquatic biota of the Great Lakes system and that are 
      exerting, singly or in synergistic or additive combination, a toxic effect 
      on aquatic, animal, or human life. </P>
      <P>"Level I" substances as listed in <B><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#Appendix I">Appendix I</A></B> 
      represent the primary focus around which the governments will concentrate 
      and lead actions and efforts. Since these Level I substances have been 
      associated with or have the potential to cause deleterious environmental 
      impacts because of their presence in the Basin, they represent an 
      immediate priority and are targeted for virtual elimination through 
      pollution prevention and other incentive-based actions that phase out 
      their use, generation or release in a cost-effective manner within the 
      most expedient time-frame. For anthropogenic sources of 
      naturally-occurring substances, the Strategy will, when warranted, seek to 
      reduce such sources so as to achieve naturally-occurring levels. </P>
      <P>The Strategy also includes actions for a second set of substances 
      ("Level II" substances) -- listed in<B> <A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#Appendix I">Appendix I</A></B> 
      -- that have been identified by one or both countries as having the 
      potential to significantly impact the Great Lakes ecosystem through their 
      use and/or release. Until and unless these substances are placed on the 
      Level I list, the governments encourage stakeholders to undertake 
      pollution prevention activities to reduce levels in the environment of 
      those substances nominated jointly by both countries, and to conform with 
      the laws and policies of each country, including pollution prevention, 
      with respect to those substances nominated by only one country. </P>
      <P>USEPA and EC intend to consult with stakeholders on proposed changes to 
      the lists at the biennial meeting of the State of the Lakes Ecosystem 
      Conference (SOLEC) or another appropriate forum. Existing processes for 
      nominating or elevating substances will be used, e.g., Bioaccumulative 
      Chemicals of Concern (BCCs) in the U.S., TSMP, and COA in Canada, or LaMP 
      Critical Pollutants. It is not the intent of the Strategy to initiate a 
      new nominating process. Existing nominating and chemical screening 
      processes already include a strong public participation component. </P>
      <P>The two nations will share information regarding the persistence, 
      bioaccumulation potential, and toxicity of Level II substances. In 
      addition, EC and USEPA in cooperation with their partners will 
      periodically examine the substances addressed by the Strategy to determine 
      whether any Level II substances should be elevated to the Level I list, 
      whether new substances which present threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem 
      should be considered for inclusion on the Level I or II lists, and whether 
      any other changes should be made. If a substance is identified as Level I 
      the two countries will set binational virtual elimination challenges for 
      it. Elevation to Level I or removal of a substance from Level II will be 
      made with appropriate opportunity for public review and comment. </P>
      <P><A name=Challenges></A><B>Challenges</B> </P>
      <P>EC and USEPA, working in cooperation with their partners, accept the 
      following challenges as significant milestones on the path toward virtual 
      elimination. These milestones will be achieved by implementing voluntary 
      efforts to achieve reductions of particular Level I substances and through 
      currently anticipated regulatory actions under environmental laws in both 
      countries. In Canada, the baseline used for these milestones will be 1988, 
      in keeping with the Accelerated Reduction and Elimination of Toxics 
      Program (ARET) baseline and the 1987 GLWQA. For the U.S., the baseline 
      from which reductions will be measured is unique for each substance, and 
      is identified in <B><A 
      href="http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/p2/bns.html#Technical Support Document Attachment 1">Attachment 
      1</A></B>; the best available data will be used, which in most cases is 
      the most recent baseline. </P>
      <P>As new information and data on opportunities, and their associated 
      costs and benefits become available, EC and USEPA may revise the 
      milestones, using a public consultation process involving their partners. 
      In some cases, the challenges may differ between EC and USEPA based on 
      different start dates for their respective domestic toxics reduction 
      programs, different regulatory and legislative authorities, and different 
      chemical data bases, baselines and inventories. </P>
      <P>EC and USEPA will work with their partners to:

      <P><A name=Priority></A><B>Priority Activities</B> </P>
      <P>To meet the above challenges, EC and USEPA will implement the four-step 
      analytical framework outlined earlier and will regularly reassess progress 
      being made. Through this framework, the governments will engage key 
      partners, both inside and outside the Basin, in the process of setting 
      more specific milestones and in developing and implementing solutions to 
      achieve those milestones. Where possible, formal or informal agreements 
      may be developed. EC and USEPA will publicly recognize the successful 
      efforts undertaken by all segments of society. </P>
      <P>In addition, EC and USEPA will enlist the support of municipalities, 
      industries, product manufacturers and others outside the Basin to assist 
      in meeting the challenges in the Strategy, especially for those substances 
      which may be entering the Great Lakes via long-range transport, consistent 
      with the approaches outlined in the Strategy. </P>
      <P><A name="Joint Progress Measurement and Reporting"></A><B>Joint 
      Progress Measurement and Reporting Activities</B> </P>
      <P>The following are examples of joint priority Canadian-U.S. activities. 
      EC and USEPA will review these joint projects annually for additions 
      and/or modifications. </P>
      <P>It is recognized that, for some of the Level I and II substances, 
      measurement of releases or ambient levels is not always feasible using 
      routine sampling and analytical techniques. EC and USEPA are committed to 
      adopting, where feasible or necessary, a range of indicators from process 
      measurements (e.g., the number of formal or informal agreements entered 
      into with business sectors to achieve specific reductions) to 
      environmental endpoints (e.g., fish contaminant levels) in order to 
      measure progress. Indicators will be identified to address the use, 
      generation, and release of Strategy substances. The Strategy recognizes 
      that the information contributed by our ongoing joint emissions inventory 
      work will be extremely useful in addressing major sources within the 
      jurisdictions bordering the Great Lakes. </P>
      <P>To fulfill the implementation requirements of this Strategy and other 
      critical bilateral Great Lakes activities, EC and USEPA will work with 
      federal, state, and provincial departments and agencies, to review, within 
      the context of existing resources, the state of Great Lakes related 
      surveillance and monitoring programs in order to improve their 
      coordination. </P>
      <P>EC and USEPA commit jointly to report on progress (including release 
      reductions leading to virtual elimination) under this Strategy at the 
      biennial meeting of SOLEC or another appropriate forum. In addition, EC 
      and USEPA will periodically convene a stakeholder forum to assess 
      progress, identify new opportunities for reductions, and, if appropriate, 
      evaluate the status of the Level I and II substances and refine the 
      challenge milestones. These reporting mechanisms may be modified if 
      necessary. </P>
      <P>As well, in order to assess progress toward achieving the above 
      commitments, EC and USEPA will establish a process for determining 
      baseline release levels and loadings of Level I and II substances through 
      a data synthesis and modelling effort, based on best available data and 
      scientific information. </P>
      <P><A name="Significant Issues"></A><B>Significant Issues</B> </P>
      <P>EC and USEPA will work together to address significant toxic 
      substances-related issues which affect the whole Great Lakes Basin 
      throughout the implementation of this Strategy. These issues will be 
      selected in consultation with our partners. For example, these issues may 
      include the transboundary effects of incineration, the transboundary 
      movement of hazardous wastes and bilateral sector-specific pollution 
      prevention initiatives. </P>

      <P align=left>The intent of the Strategy is to identify and focus efforts 
      on those substances which are persistent and toxic, especially, but not 
      exclusively, those which bioaccumulate. Rather than use a new screening 
      and assessment process, the Strategy seeks to build upon the most recent 
      and relevant science-based selection processes used in either country. 
      These processes considered a wide range of factors such as chemical and 
      physical properties, potential to cause cancer, toxicity, risk to human 
      health and wildlife, presence in the environment, as well as adverse 
      impacts observed in the environment. Asymmetries in the approaches or 
      information used by the two nations, or in definitions of bioaccumulation 
      produced some differences in lists identified by each country. However, 
      because the Strategy is a binational activity, the final list of chemicals 
      was the result of agreement on the nominations from the two countries.

      <P align=left>Through the Lake Superior Binational Program, Canada and the

      <P align=left><B>In the United States:</B> </P>
      <P align=left>The primary remaining source of mercury in the Great Lakes 
      ecosystem is atmospheric deposition of mercury emissions, often 
      transported over long distances. The U.S. is using the most recent mercury 
      emissions inventory, i.e., that which was conducted during the early 
      1990s, to measure reductions. This inventory suggests that the U.S. 
      currently releases about 200 tons of mercury to the atmosphere annually. 
      Standards for municipal waste combustors (which have been finalized for 
      major sources and which will be re-promulgated for minor sources) and 
      medical waste incinerators (proposed) will, when implemented by 2002, 
      provide about a 70 ton reduction in mercury emissions, or 35 percent of 
      current total U.S. emissions. Implementation of other Maximum Available 
      Control Technology (MACT) standards offers the probability of further 
      mercury emission reductions, though these cannot be estimated prior to 
      their development. Direct controls on emissions will be complemented by 
      the promotion of innovative technologies to reduce use and increase 
      recycling, in order to reduce the amount of mercury entering the 
      incinerator waste stream. Increased consumption of fossil fuels may, 
      however, increase mercury emissions in the future. The U.S. has reduced 
      mercury use 75 percent during the past 15 years, most of which has 
      occurred since 1988. Given a 30-year trend away from mercury use in the 
      U.S., it is expected that companies will continue to develop and market 
      mercury-free alternatives as was done with alkaline batteries. Chlorine 
      production, for example, is the largest national use of mercury. However, 
      as new chlorine production plants are built, this industry is shifting 
      from the mercury cell process to successor technologies which avoid the 
      use of mercury. USEPA expects to release its Mercury Report to Congress in 
      1998. </P>

        Pollution Prevention Pledge Program for Ontario and ARET. Within the 
        U.S., the Common Sense Initiative and other programs will support this 
        action. </P></LI></UL>

      Strategy only.</I> </P>
      <P align=left><B>Canada-Ontario Agreement Respecting the Great Lakes Basin 
      Ecosystem (COA)</B>: Canada and Ontario have entered into an agreement in 
      1994 to renew and strengthen federal-provincial planning, cooperation and 
      coordination in implementing actions to restore and protect the ecosystem, 
      to prevent and control pollution into the ecosystem, and to conserve 
      species, populations and habitats in the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. 
      Implementation of this agreement contributes substantially to meeting 
      Canada's obligations under the 1987 GLWQA. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Great Lakes Basin</B>: The Great Lakes Basin means all of 
      the streams, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water that are within the 
      drainage basin of the St. Lawrence River at or upstream from the point at 
      which this river becomes the international boundary between Canada and the 
      U.S., as defined by the 1987 GLWQA. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, as amended 
      by Protocol signed November 18, 1987</B>: An agreement between the U.S. 
      and Canada to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological 
      integrity of the water of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Life cycle</B>: Consecutive and interlinked stages of a 
      product system, from raw material acquisition or generation of natural 
      resources to the final disposal. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Persistent Toxic Substances</B>: Those substances which 
      have a long half-life in the environment. Substances identified in the 
      Strategy have been nominated from multiple selection processes. It is 
      recognized that there are different definitions of persistence which are 
      used in the various U.S. and Canadian domestic programs. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Release</B>: A release is any introduction of a toxic 
      chemical to the environment as a result of human activity. This includes 
      emissions to the air; discharges from point and non-point sources to 
      bodies of water; introductions to land, including spills or leaks from 
      waste piles, contained disposal into underground injection wells, or other 
      sources. </P>
      <P align=left><B>Resulting from human activity</B>: Any and all sources 
      resulting from human activity, including but not limited to releases from 
      industrial or energy-producing processes, landfilling or other actions. 
      </P>
      <P align=left><B>Toxic Substance</B>: "Any substance which can cause 
      death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, 
      physiological or reproductive malfunctions or physical deformities in any 
      organism or its offspring, or which can become poisonous after 
      concentration in the food chain or in combination with other substances."

      <P align=left><A name=N_1_></A><SUP>1</SUP> Hereafter, the terms 
      "substances" or "Strategy substances" shall mean persistent toxic 
      substances resulting from human activity, particularly those which 
      bioaccumulate, and which are the focus of efforts under this Strategy. For 
      further information on the meaning of persistent toxic substances, see the 
      Glossary and Appendix I. </P>
      <P align=left><A name=N_2_></A><SUP>2</SUP> In the U.S., existing and 
      currently planned regulatory actions will contribute to meeting the goal 
      of virtual elimination; however, this Strategy is not a regulatory action, 
      nor is it expected, in and of itself, to lead to the promulgation of any 
      rule or regulation. To the extent that regulatory actions are taken with 
      regard to Strategy substances, they will be governed by the statutes 
      authorizing the actions. </P>
      <P align=left><A name=N_3_></A><SUP>3</SUP> When developing the Strategy 
      and the reduction targets, the U.S. started with the presumption that 
      releases of the Level I substances could be reduced by roughly an order of 
      magnitude (90 percent) by 2006. Early drafts of the Strategy contained 
      this goal. However, analysis of baseline emissions inventories has shown 
      in some cases that reductions of this level may not be practical from a 
      technical or economic standpoint. For instance, an analysis of U.S. 
      mercury emissions shows that even a considerable regulatory and pollution 
      prevention effort is unlikely to result in reductions of 90 percent 
      between 1991 and 2006. However, a reduction of roughly one-half from the 
      emissions levels in the most recent mercury emissions inventory is 
      believed to be feasible. Thus, the U.S. challenge in the binational 
      Strategy sets a goal of 50 percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2006.
