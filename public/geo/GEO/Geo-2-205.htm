<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The overriding objective 
of governance for sustainable development is to bring about an integration of 
economic, social and environmental strategies and policies.&nbsp; This is to 
facilitate a transformation of the economy from unsustainable to more 
sustainable patterns of production and consumption. A strengthening of 
governance for sustainable development must be based on the principles of 
responsibility in open market economies. The role of the political institutions 
on an international level is to provide national governments with visions, 
knowledge, policy tools, and agreed standards for a successful integration of 
the three policy areas. The role of national governments is to set objectives 
and targets, create the necessary incentives and the legal frameworks and 
provision of services for a transformation of the economy. The role of economic 
and social actors, employers and workers, in business and SMEs, farmers and 
entrepreneurs, is to make the necessary decisions regarding investment and 
technology, with the goal of creating new and sustainable patterns of production 
and preservation of natural resources.&nbsp; Success in achieving the objectives 
of the strategy for sustainable development requires strengthening of all the 
various aspects of good governance. </FONT>&nbsp;<BR></P>
