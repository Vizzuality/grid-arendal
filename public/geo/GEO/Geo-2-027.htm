      face=Arial><BR>Canada's climate change policy has been developed against a 
      view of likely future trends in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Natural 
      Resources Canada and Environment Canada have developed projections of what 
      these trends might be, based on extensive consultations with provinces and 
      stakeholders.1 The projections cover emissions both from energy-use 
      sources, about 90 percent of the total, and from non-energy sources. 
      </FONT><FONT color=#000000></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The projections described are based on a set of 
      reasonable assumptions concerning factors which influence future emissions 
      trends. The estimates are most reliable in the short to medium term, given 
      the difficulty of predicting specific changes in technology or investment 
      over a long span of time.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>It should also be noted that one 
      important set of variables, namely current federal and provincial energy, 
      environment and related policies, is held constant over the projection 
      period. Maintenance of current policy is a deliberately imposed constraint 
      employed both to examine the implications of the current policy mix and to 
      provide a reference to evaluate the need for new or revised 
      policies.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#000000>The projections also incorporate 
      the impact of government policies intended to reduce GHG emissions, such 
      as those included in the estimates of the impact of announced federal, 
      provincial, and municipal initiatives focused on energy efficiency, 
      renewable energy, and other measures to reduce GHG emissions. These 
      initiatives include all significant measures either directly related to, 
      or reflecting the objectives of the National Action Program on Climate 
      Change (NAPCC), in particular the commitments under the Voluntary 
      Challenge and Registry. <BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT color=#000000 sans-serif

      color=#000000><BR>Emissions grew by 9.5 per cent from 1990 to 1995. 
      Following a slight dampening of this growth to 2000, attributable largely 
      to the impact of initiatives, the trend in emissions is steadily upward. 
      By 2010, emissions are projected to be 105 megatonnes (19 per cent) higher 
      than in 1990. By 2020, they are projected to be 203 megatonnes (36 per 
      cent) higher. The primary source of these increases are population and 
      economic growth, coupled with low energy prices and a shift to fossil 
      fuels, particularly, natural gas, for electricity 
      generation.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>Methane emissions generally follow the 
      overall upward trend. Nitrous oxide emissions, however, initially decline 
      before growing again, owing to increased emissions from catalytic 
      converters in automobiles and other vehicles. Other sources, principally 
      chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes, also grow appreciably from a small 
      base.<BR></FONT></P>

      arial,><B><I><BR>Projections by Sector</I></B></FONT><FONT 
      color=#000000><BR>The largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in 
      both absolute and growth terms is transportation. The increase is about 
      equally accounted for by passenger vehicles and freight. The increase in 
      emissions from the industrial sector is also significant, but the pace is 
      somewhat slower. The commercial sector is projected to show a modest 
      increase and the residential sector an absolute decrease in emissions. 
      These results are closely linked to the impact of energy efficiency 
      regulations and programs on buildings, heating systems, and other 
      energy-using equipment. It is worth noting that the projections for the 
      residential, commercial and industrial sectors would be generally higher 
      if the emissions from electricity were allocated to each sector. 
      </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>For electricity generation, emissions 
      are projected initially to decrease but then climb significantly as 
      natural gas and, to a lesser extent, coal become the preferred fuel 
      sources. This projection was, however, developed prior to the August 13, 
      1997 decision by Ontario Hydro to "lay up" seven of its nuclear units. The 
      need to offset this loss of supply by increased use of fossil fuel 
      capacity will result in a 15-20 megatonne increase in emissions in 2000. 
      At time of writing, Ontario Hydro is committed to restoring the nuclear 
      units to operation over the next ten years. This would suggest a return to 
      the reference emissions projection by 2010.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>In the fossil fuel production sector, 
      emissions grow rapidly from 1990 to 2000 but level off thereafter. This 
      trend is related to the increasing effectiveness of initiatives to 
      constrain carbon dioxide emissions and methane leakage by the oil and gas 
      industry, which take place against a backdrop of significantly increased 
      production and exports.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#000000>Non-energy emissions initially 
      decline, but then grow appreciably. The major driver of this growth is the 
      increasing use of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) substitutes for 
      CFCs.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT color=#000000 sans-serif

      <P><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>Several points are worth noting: </FONT>
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>In the short term, to 2000, emissions 
        growth is greater than the national average in Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
        British Columbia. These increases are associated with the resource boom 
        in the west and, in the case of British Columbia, population 
        increases.<BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>In the longer term, however, growth 
        in emissions is more evenly distributed across provinces, with Ontario 
        and British Columbia recording above average increases. For Ontario, the 
        chief reasons for the increases are the greater use of natural gas and 
        coal for electricity generation. The chart does not reflect the decision 
        by Ontario Hydro to lay-up some of its nuclear units.<BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>The results for Alberta and, to a 
        lesser extent, Saskatchewan suggest a deceleration in the growth of 
        emissions after 2000. This is largely the result of the increasing 
        effectiveness of the oil and gas industry initiatives to constrain 
        emissions.<BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>While Quebec and the Atlantic region 
        have minimal emissions growth to 2000, their results thereafter are more 
        in line with national trends.<BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial>Within the Atlantic region, the 
        growth in emissions is above the regional average in New Brunswick and 
        Newfoundland, reflecting, for the latter in particular, their strong 
        resource-based development.<BR></FONT></LI></UL>
