<H2>1.1. Overview of the Assessment</H2>
<P>The world community faces many risks from climate change. Clearly, it is 
important to understand the nature of those risks, where natural and human 
systems are likely to be most vulnerable, and what may be achieved by adaptive 
responses. To understand better the potential impacts and associated dangers of 
global climate change, Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) offers this Third Assessment Report (TAR) on the state of 
knowledge concerning the sensitivity, adaptability, and vulnerability of 
physical, ecological, and social systems to climate change. Building on the 
Second Assessment Report (SAR), this new report reexamines key findings of the 
earlier assessment and emphasizes new information and implications on the basis 
of more recent studies. </P>
<P>Human activities&#8212;primarily burning of fossil fuels and changes in land 
cover&#8212;are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents or properties 
of the Earth&#8217;s surface that absorb or scatter radiant energy. In particular, 
increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols are 
strongly implicated as contributors to climatic changes observed during the 20th 
century and are expected to contribute to further changes in climate in the 21st 
century and beyond. These changes in atmospheric composition are likely to alter 
temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea level, extreme events, and other 
aspects of climate on which the natural environment and human systems depend. 
</P>
<P>One of several primary issues this report has been organized to address is a 
key question before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC): What are the potential impacts for societies and ecosystems of 
different atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols that absorb and 
scatter sunlight (United Nations, 1992)? Answering this question is a necessary 
step in assessing what constitutes &#8220;dangerous anthropogenic interference in the 
climate system.&#8221; This report does not make any judgments about what level of 
concentrations is &#8220;dangerous&#8221; because that is not a question of science per se 
but a value judgment about relative risks and tradeoffs. The task is to make the 
evidence about relative risks as clear as possible. This report therefore 
describes what is known about the distribution of impacts; how, why, and to what 
extent they differ from region to region or place to place; and how this relates 
to the distribution of vulnerability and capacity to adapt. However, it 
critically assesses the literature to help inform policymakers about effects 
associated with different concentration levels, so they may judge what levels of 
risk are acceptable. Assessment of what constitutes dangerous interference in 
the climate systems will require analysis of the interactions of climate change 
and social and economic conditions, which are inextricably linked. Understanding 
the role of socioeconomic factors, particularly adaptive responses and capacity, 
is critical. </P>

  ~58°S.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><A name=fig11></A>Part of the justification 
for a TAR at this time is the abundance of new evidence that has come to the 
attention of the expert community since publication of the SAR. The evidence is 
drawn predominantly from published, peer-reviewed scientific literature. 
Evidence also is drawn from published, non-peer-reviewed literature and 
unpublished sources such as industry journals; reports of government agencies, 
research institutions, and other organizations; proceedings of workshops; 
working papers; and unpublished data sets. The quality and validity of 
information from non-peer-reviewed and unpublished sources have been assessed by 
authors of this report prior to inclusion of information from these sources in 
the report. The procedures for the use of information from non-peer-reviewed and 
unpublished sources are described in IPCC (1999a) and discussed in Skodvin 
(2000). 
<P>Although this report builds on previous assessments, including the SAR and 
the IPCC&#8217;s Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change (IPCC, 1998), 
the TAR departs from them in important respects. In comparison to previous 
assessments, greater attention is given to climate change adaptation; multiple 
pressures on systems; links between climate change, sustainable development, and 
equity; and characterization of the state-of-the-science and confidence levels 
associated with key conclusions of the assessment (see <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/055.htm#box11">Box 1-1</A>). This overview 
chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive summary of the principal 
findings of the TAR, but it helps to illustrate basic concepts by selectively 
reporting on a few key conclusions, as well as providing a more comprehensive 
road map to the materials presented later in the report: </P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Part I sets the stage for assessment of impacts, adaptation, and 
  vulnerability by discussing the context of climate change, methods for 
  research on impacts, and development of scenarios. These are important 
  additions to what was emphasized in the SAR. Consideration of the context of 
  change (in this chapter) draws attention to the relationship of climate change 
  and sustainable development, including interactions of climate variability and 
  change with other environmental changes and evolving demographic, social, and 
  economic conditions that affect driving forces of change and resources 
  available for adaptation. Assessment of methods (<A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/068.htm">Chapter 2</A>) and approaches 
  for developing and applying scenarios (<A 
  href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/122.htm">Chapter 3</A>) cover scientific 
  and technical aspects of research on impacts, providing a review of the 
  science underlying the topics covered in other chapters of the report. 
  <LI>Part II assesses recent advances in experimental work, observations, and 
  modeling that contribute to the current state of knowledge of baseline trends, 
  vulnerabilities, and adaptation options in six sectors or resource areas. This 
  section of the report integrates material that had been covered in 18 chapters 
  in the SAR, focusing to a greater extent on cross-sectoral issues. For 
  example, <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/196.htm">Chapter 5</A>, 
  Ecosystems and their Goods and Services, integrates what had been separate 
  chapters on forests, rangelands, deserts, mountain regions, wetlands, 
  agriculture, food security, and other systems; it also adds assessment of 
  climate change impacts on wildlife&#8212;an issue not covered in the SAR. 
  Integrating these issues into a single chapter provides an opportunity for 
  improved assessment of interactions across these systems, the effects of 
  change on landscapes, and the distribution of land use and cover. Information 
  on the impacts of natural variability and the potential for nonlinear 
  interactions also is included in the chapters in Part II. 
  <LI>Chapters in Part III build on key findings of the IPCC&#8217;s Special Report on 
  Regional Impacts of Climate Change. Each chapter and subchapter in this part 
  of the report explores what has been learned regarding the context of change, 
  sensitivity, adaptation, and vulnerability of key sectors. A chapter is 
  devoted to each of eight regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Australia and New 
  Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, polar regions, and small island 
  states (see <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/055.htm#fig11">Figure 
  1-1</A>). These regions are chosen to correspond to continents or&#8212;in the case 
  of polar regions and small island states&#8212;to bring together in one chapter 
  areas that share important attributes related to climate change vulnerability. 
  This regionalization of the world is convenient for organizing the report, but 
  it must be recognized that there is a high degree of heterogeneity within each 
  of these regions in terms of climate, ecosystems, culture, and social, 
  economic, and political systems. Consequently, climate change impacts, 
  adaptive capacity, and vulnerability vary markedly within each of these 
  regions. These chapters provide an opportunity to place vulnerability and 
  adaptation in the context of multiple stresses and regional resources for 
  adaptation. This is an extremely important development because it calls 
  attention to the issues that regional and local decisionmakers in the private 
  and public sectors will be facing in each of the regions. </LI></UL>

      <P align=center><B>Box 1-1 Uncertainties and Confidence Scale </B></P>
      <P>The many conclusions presented in this report are subject to varying 
      degrees of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty attached to conclusions 
      in this report are assessed and reported in two different ways. One is to 
      assess and report a confidence level for a conclusion, using a Bayesian 
      probability framework. (Bayesian assessments of probability distributions 
      would lead to the following interpretation of probability statements: The 
      probability of an event is the degree of belief that exists among lead 
      authors and reviewers that the event will occur, given observations, 
      modeling results, and theory currently available.) The second is to assess 
      and report the quality or level of scientific understanding that supports 
      a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The 5-point confidence scale below is used to assign confidence levels 
      to selected conclusions. The confidence levels are stated as Bayesian 
      probabilities, meaning that they represent the degree of belief among the 
      authors of the report in the validity of a conclusion, based on their 
      collective expert judgment of all observational evidence, modeling 
      results, and theory currently available to them. </P>

<P>Areas of important new findings include detection of impacts of observed 
climatic changes on environmental systems, transient scenarios, vulnerability to 
changes in climate variability, and vulnerability to strongly nonlinear, 
complex, and discontinuous responses to climate change. Another distinction from 
previous assessments is the recognition in the TAR that the many complexities of 
analysis logically lead to a focus on ranges of outcomes and characterizations, 
using subjective probabilities of events, rather than primary emphasis on &#8220;best 
guesses,&#8221; point estimates, single &#8220;optimum,&#8221; or aggregate conclusions. Finally, 
the TAR has circulated cross-cutting &#8220;guidance papers&#8221; to all three working 
groups to try to achieve more consistency in dealing with four areas: 
development, sustainability, and equity; uncertainties; costing methodologies; 
and decision analytic frameworks (see <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/055.htm#box12">Box 1-2</A>). </P>
<P>The IPCC&#8217;s charge to Working Group II for the TAR implies that consideration 
of the impacts of climate change in the SAR is insufficient per se as a basis 
for decisionmaking. In general, the SAR was able to address the implications of 
climate change only for single economic sectors or environmental components. 
With this in mind, <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/159.htm">Chapters 
4</A>&#8211;<A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/657.htm">19</A> consider the 
various decision analysis framework tools to improve upon the responses to the 
impacts of climate change provided in the SAR. In the current exercise, not only 
are possible implications of climate change for the various economic sectors or 
environmental components assessed, options to alleviate identified impacts are 
investigated. In addition, direct and indirect costs of adaptation options are 
explored, and an extensive assessment of direct and indirect benefits is 
provided. Where monetary values can be assigned, CBA is employed to determine 
the optimal value of adaptation measures, including sensitivity analysis to 
critical parameters, and CEA is adopted to identify the least-cost solution to 
targeted mitigation objectives. </P><A name=box12></A>

      <P align=center><B>Box 1-2. Cross-Cutting Issues Guidance Papers </B></P>
      <P>Four cross-cutting guidance papers (Pachauri et al., 2000) were 
      available to all Lead Authors of all three IPCC working groups. Many of 
      the concepts in these papers were previously unfamiliar to a large number 
      of the Lead Authors. Significant efforts were made to incorporate the 
      uncertainties guidance and at least consider the guidance in other papers 
      by each working group. Future assessments will be increasingly able to 
      benefit from the suggestions and frameworks in these four cross-cutting 
      guidance papers. </P>
      <P><I><B>Development, Sustainability, and Equity (DSE) (Munasinghe, 2000) 
      </B></I></P>
      <P>DSE is relevant to Working Group II with respect to three questions: 
      How do development paths and equity conditions influence vulnerability to 
      climate change and the capacity to adapt to or cope with climate change? 
      How might climate change impacts and adaptation responses affect prospects 
      for attaining sustainable development and equity goals? What types of 
      policies are capable of reducing climate change vulnerability and 
      promoting sustainable development and equity objectives? </P>
      <P>DSE is a response to principles contained in UNFCCC Article 3.4 (to 
      promote sustainable development). Article 3.2 takes into account the 
      special needs and circumstances of developing countries. Article 4 deals, 
      for example, with the responsibility of developed nations, competing 
      priorities for developing nations, and &#8220;common, but differentiated 
      responsibilities,&#8221; and Article 2 says to avoid &#8220;dangerous&#8221; interference 
      with the climate system (United Nations, 1992). DSE is closely tied to 
      sustainable development with respect to three underlying dimensions: 
      economic, social, and environmental. </P>
      <P>Development has been characterized as &#8220;qualitative improvement&#8221; 
      (Ishida, 1998), including economic growth and social dimensions. 
      Sustainability of a system refers to its durability or its capacity to 
      withstand and recover from disturbances (WCED, 1987)&#8212;in other words, its 
      resilience. Equity refers to procedural as well as distributional issues. 
      Procedural issues relate to how decisions are made (e.g., internal equity 
      and governance structures within nations could have significant effects on 
      adaptive capacity). Distributional equity, on the other hand, relates to 
      how the costs of impacts, mitigation, and adaptation are shared. Equity 
      considerations are important in addressing global climate change for 
      several reasons, including moral and ethical concerns; facilitating 
      cooperation because equitable decisions carry greater legitimacy; the 
      social dimension of sustainable development; and the UNFCCC itself, which 
      considers equity as one of its basis principles (in Article 3.1). </P>
      <P>Climate change could undermine social welfare, equity, and the 
      sustainability of future development. In particular, it is generally 
      believed that developing countries and disadvantaged groups within all 
      countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (e.g., <A 
      href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/641.htm">Chapter 18</A>) as a result 
      of limited resources and low adaptive capacity. </P>
      <P><B><I>Uncertainty (Moss and Schneider, 2000) </I></B></P>
      <P>Anticipating the imperfect nature of available information, UNFCCC 
      Article 3.3 provides guidance to the effect that &#8220;where there are threats 
      of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty 
      should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to anticipate, 
      prevent, or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse 
      effects&#8221; (United Nations, 1992). The uncertainties guidance paper develops 
      a unified approach for assessing, characterizing, and reporting 
      uncertainties in the TAR. The most important contribution of the 
      uncertainties guidance paper is the construction of confidence schemes and 
      qualitative terms to describe the state of science, which are reproduced 
      in Box 1-1. The goal is to promote consistency in evaluating the judgments 
      of scientific experts, to facilitate communication of these judgments to 
      nonspecialists, and to provide peer-reviewed guidance for policymakers. 
      Thus, a great deal of importance is attached to assessing the scientific 
      merit of information in the literature and &#8220;explicitly distinguishing and 
      communicating which findings are well understood, which are somewhat 
      understood, and which are speculative&#8221; (Moss and Schneider, 1997). <A 
      href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/103.htm">Section 2.6</A> discusses in 
      more detail the differences between the well-calibrated ranges in the 
      literature and the much larger, full range of uncertainty as well as the 
      cascade of uncertainty that occurs when ranges in climate scenarios are 
      cascaded with uncertainties in each successive step of assessment. In <A 
      href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/159.htm">Chapters 4</A>&#8211;<A 
      href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/657.htm">19</A>, selected findings 
      are assigned levels of confidence, using either the scale for assessing 
      confidence level quantitatively or the matrix for assessing the state of 
      knowledge qualitatively. </P>
      <P>Especially in the regional chapters, uncertainty about future climate 
      is the dominant cause of uncertainty about the character and magnitude of 
      impacts. In such cases, confidence estimates are evaluated conditionally 
      on a specific climate change scenarios to avoid &#8220;cascades&#8221; (see <A 
      href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/108.htm#fig22">Figure 2-2</A>) in 
      which confidence in the occurrence of an event does not include compounded 
      uncertainties in each factor that contributes to the final outcome. 
      Instead, the assessment evaluates each step in the cascade separately&#8212;what 
      is called a &#8220;traceable account&#8221;&#8212;and is particularly appropriate for any 
      aggregate conclusions. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

to assessment of opportunities for and barriers to adaptation. This chapter 
considers determinants of adaptive capacity; lessons from adaptation to 
present-day climate variability and extremes; the potential effectiveness of 
adaptation measures; and global-, national-, and local-scale options for 
strengthening adaptive capacity, especially for vulnerable populations, 
countries, or zones. <A href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/657.htm">Chapter 
19</A>, a synthesis, also is new to the TAR. It draws on the analyses of other 
chapters, synthesizing information that is important for interpretation of 
Article 2 of the UNFCCC and key provisions of international agreements to 
address climate change. Potential global impacts of different stabilization 
levels of atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are assessed. <A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/657.htm">Chapter 19</A> assesses 
vulnerability within the framework of sustainable development and equity, 
acknowledging common but differentiated responsibilities. </P>
<P>The issue of what constitutes sustainable development was advanced in 1987 by 
the World Commission on Environment and Development (the so-called Brundtland 
Commission; WCED, 1987). The commission defined sustainable development as 
&#8220;development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221; and notes that &#8220;even the 
narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity 
between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within 
each generation.&#8221; The goal of sustainable development is a stable human 
environmental system in which available resources are sufficient to meet the 
needs of society in perpetuity. Questions have been asked about whether &#8220;needs,&#8221; 
as conceived in the Brundtland Commission report, should be limited to 
environment-dependent basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, and health 
or should include more qualitative aspects such as comfort, convenience, or 
other &#8220;quality of life&#8221; measures. There is no consensus in the literature 
regarding what constitutes the limits of &#8220;needs&#8221; in this context. </P>
<P>Because available studies have not employed a common set of climate scenarios 
and methods and because of uncertainties regarding the sensitivities and 
adaptability of natural and human-dominated systems, assessment of regional 
vulnerabilities is necessarily qualitative. Whenever possible, quantitative 
estimates of the impacts of climate change are cited in this report. Field or 
experimental data often provide quantitative underpinnings for specific 
circumstances, but rarely are complex systems sufficiently described by the 
limited number of cases in which a large quantity of &#8220;hard data&#8221; is available. 
Thus, most quantitative estimates are still dependent on the specific 
assumptions employed regarding future changes in climate, as well as the 
particular methods and models applied in the analyses. On the other hand, issues 
in which there is a great deal of relevant field or lab data are likely to carry 
higher confidence in any such quantitative estimate. To interpret these 
estimates, it is important to bear in mind uncertainties regarding the 
character, magnitude, and rates of future climate change that will affect 
society&#8217;s degree of exposure. Of comparable importance are uncertainties 
associated with future states of the human condition&#8212;for example, the extent and 
quality of economic development throughout the world and the evolution of 
traditions and institutions in societies&#8212;that will affect profoundly the 
capacity for coping and adaptation, hence level of vulnerability. These 
uncertainties impose limitations on the ability of the research community to 
project the impacts of climate change, particularly at regional and smaller 
scales. </P>
<P>This introductory chapter is organized to address a series of questions: What 
is potentially at stake as a result of changes in climate (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/056.htm">Section 1.2</A>)? How has society 
responded to the risks and potential opportunities (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/059.htm">Section 1.3</A>)? How are impacts, 
adaptation, and vulnerability assessed in the report (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/060.htm">Section 1.4</A>)? How do the 
complexities of analysis affect the assessment (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/063.htm">Section 1.5</A>)? How can this 
assessment be used to address policy-relevant questions (<A 
href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/tar/wg2/066.htm">Section 1.6</A>)?</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
