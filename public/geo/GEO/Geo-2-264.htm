    season. Nobody knew what was causing it. Hundreds of dead fish were 
    appearing, floating in the sea or washed up on the beaches along certain 
    shorelines in the Windward Islands. 
    <P>Reports indicate that the phenomenon may have begun in Guyana in July. 
    The first report in the islands came from Peruvian Vale on the eastern coast 
    of St. Vincent, where fishermen said they started noticing quantities of 
    dead fish on 28 August. Similar fish kills were subsequently reported in 
    Grenada, Barbados, Bequia and Tobago. All reports came from the 
    northeastern, eastern or southeastern coasts of the islands. Grenadian 
    zoologist Ros Dopwell tells Compass that there have been no regional fish 
    kills of this magnitude in living memory, although there have been smaller 
    isolated incidents. 
    <P>The first kills occurred after heavy seasonal rains. The initial victims 
    were herbivorous reef fish living at depths of 10 to 20 meters. But soon 
    other species, including grouper and snapper, became affected, indicating a 
    movement of the unknown killer agent into deeper waters. 
    <P>On 3 September, the Fisheries Division of St. Vincent &amp; the 
    Grenadines issued warnings to the public to desist from selling or consuming 
    fish found in specified areas, and a scientific investigation got underway. 
    The other affected countries began their own investigations, as did regional 
    agencies concerned with fisheries, health and the environment. 
    <P>The reported findings were often contradictory, and the public became 
    increasingly confused and alarmed. 
    <P>An early report from Grenada indicated that "the dumping of hazardous 
    chemicals and toxic waste from a cruise line is responsible." That nation's 
    Prime Minister, Dr. Keith Mitchell, immediately issued a counterstatement: 
    "Let us not speculate and attach blame without proof." 
    <P>St. Vincent's Minister of Agriculture, Jeremiah Scott, quoted in local 
    newspapers, said that water samples "suggest that some sort of toxic 
    chemical may have been present." A fisheries official in Barbados was then 
    quoted on a Caribbean Broadcasting Union (CBU) television report as saying 
    that "conclusive evidence [is that the cause of the fish kill] is likely [to 
    be] biological rather than chemical." 
    <P>Dr. Wayne Hunte, a professor of marine biology at the Bellairs Research 
    Institute in Barbados, said on that island's CBC-TV newsmagazine that the 
    most likely conclusion was that the fish died from oxygen deprivation caused 
    by an organism carried to the region by the Guyana Current. Dr. Geoff 
    Wigham, of the marine biology program at St. George's University in Grenada, 
    agreed that nutrient-rich waters from the Orinoco River in northern 
    Venezuela may have played a part, but stated that it was toxins produced by 
    a resulting algae bloom (a proliferation of microscopic marine organisms), 
    rather than simple oxygen deprivation, that killed the fish. Word then came 
    from the Institute of Marine Affairs in Trinidad that it was possible that 
    an algae bloom was not the culprit, as conditions for such an event had not 
    been favorable. 
    <P>Meanwhile, the dragnet of speculation had rounded up yet more theories 
    for the cause of the fish kill but underwater seismic activity, the 
    purported sinking of a nuclear submarine and "it's the end of the world" 
    were generally discounted. 
    <P>Then another suspect was added to the plot. A Scottish fish pathologist, 
    Dr. Hugh Ferguson, summoned from the University of Sterling to assist in 
    Barbados's investigation, said he blamed the fish kill on a bacterial 
    infection: "Microscopic examination of tissue samples revealed lesions 
    consistent with a bacterial disease. Culture from tissues of these fish by 
    the Veterinary Services Laboratory indicated that the organism was 
    streptococcus iniae." This development triggered more alarm Barbados's 
    Minister of Heath Senator Philip Goddard warned the public in an article in 
    The Nation newspaper that streptococcus iniae could be transmitted to 
    humans, and cautioned anyone handling dead fish to wear protective gear 
    including "boots, goggles, respirators and gloves." 
    <P>But a fisheries expert in Grenada quickly expressed reservations about 
    the "strep" theory. According to Barbadian veterinarian Dr. Stephen St. 
    John, this would be the first time streptococcus iniae occurred in saltwater 
    fish species rather than in fresh water, where it is not uncommon. St. 
    Vincent's Chief Fisheries Officer Kerwin Morris had previously noted that 
    "One of the first observations of the fish kills [was that] not a single 
    freshwater species [was affected]." 
    <P>Because the cause of the fish kill is still being debated, health-risk 
    warnings have also been contradictory. 
    <P>If, as Dr. Hunte surmised, the fish kill victims had died of oxygen 
    deprivation, there would be no danger in consuming other fish which may have 
    eaten the dead fish. Indeed, in early October, Barbados's Minister of 
    Agriculture Anthony Wood said "fish other than reef fish pose no threat at 
    the moment." However, if the cause of death was toxins from an algae bloom, 
    American scientist Donald Anderson warned in a 1998 Seattle Times article 
    that "some of the toxins that originate in algae concentrate as they move up 
    the food chain to the largest fish" and can affect humans. Other scientific 
    sources add that shellfish, including lobster, conch and whelks, should also 
    be avoided because toxins accumulate in their tissues and could be passed 
    on. 
    <P>The Vincentian newspaper reported that Grenada's Dr. Wigham said that 
    "even though the dead fish may look and smell bad, they can be eaten by 
    humans if the head, gills, lungs and liver are removed." This statement was 
    swiftly condemned by other experts as "premature and unfortunate". 
    <P>A CBU television broadcast more recently warned that if a fish has died 
    from streptococcus iniae infection, it is "totally unfit for human 
    consumption," although the Barbados Minister of Health noted that fish 
    caught live could be eaten, but should be thoroughly cooked, since the 
    streptococcus bacteria could be transmitted to humans. 
    <P>Not knowing what advice to take or what the real risks might be, many 
    people have given up eating fish entirely. Others never stopped, and 
    interestingly, there have been no confirmed reports of any illness in humans 
    occurring as a direct result of the fish kill, no matter what types of fish 
    have been eaten. Some experts, however, warn of possible health problems, 
    such as liver damage, surfacing in the future if certain toxins were present 
    in the eaten fish. 
    <P>Both the confusion and the investigations continue. 
    <P>An October report made by the Caribbean Fisheries Unit/CARICOM Fisheries 
    Resource and Management Programme (CFU/CFRAMP) stated that "although most 
    countries affected have done some investigation, at this stage we are still 
    not sure what is causing the fish kill. The only thing that is certain is 
    that the marine environment is under stress and several species of fishes 
    are not able to survive in the waters." 
    <P>At a regional workshop held in Barbados on 16 October, fisheries experts 
    from the affected countries met to share their preliminary findings. Also 
    present were representatives of the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, The 
    Pan-American Health Organization, the University of the West Indies, 
    Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Global Climate Change, the Institute of 
    Marine Affairs, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency, the Food 
    and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the Organization of 
    Eastern Caribbean States Natural Resources Management Unit. On the agenda 
    for the one-day meeting were possible causes of the fish kill, and its 
    socio-economic and public-health impacts. Results of this meeting were not 
    yet available as this issue of Compass went to press, but according to the 
    Caribbean News Agency a report was expected to be made at a meeting of the 
    CARICOM heads of government in Trinidad on 26-27 October. 
    <P>It is already apparent that the fish kills have seriously depleted the 
    region's main source of non-imported protein, and may cost many people their 
    livelihoods. The St. Vincent Fisheries Division reports that up to 60 
    percent of that nation's fishermen are currently not going out, and fish 
    vendors have seen a 75 percent drop in sales. Exports of fish to Martinique 
    have been halted. It is estimated that if current trends continue, St. 
    Vincent's fishing industry will lose some EC$507,000 (nearly US$190,000) per 
    month. Unofficial estimates in Barbados place a one-month loss to fishermen, 
    vendors and restaurants at between Bds$500,000 and Bds$600,000 (US$250,000 
    to US$300,000). The other affected islands face similar losses. 
    <P>Officials are concerned about other possible impacts of the fish kills. 
    Will crime increase as hundreds find themselves without work? Will tourism 
    suffer? Will precious foreign exchange be spent on American chicken to feed 
    the populace, or will those local seafood resources presumed to be 
    unaffected be overharvested? <BR>The good news is that reports of dead fish 
    are becoming less frequent. 
    <P>But the question remains why did they die?
