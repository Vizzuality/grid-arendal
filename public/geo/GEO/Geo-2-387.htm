                  destroy a large Siberian city were no match for reinforced 
                  dikes Wednesday (May 23) afternoon. For the second day in a 
                  row, bombs dropped from helicopters were successful in 
                  breaking ice floes that were clogging the Lena River and 
                  forcing it to flood Yakutsk.

                        <CENTER>The Red Cross is supplying food and clothes to 
                        flood victims. </CENTER></FONT>

                  <P>With disaster averted, Yakutsk residents who had evacuated 
                  or camped out on their roofs for days re-emerged on the 
                  streets to enjoy the spring sunshine and enjoy celebratory 
                  glasses of vodka. However, because some huge ice blocks 
                  continue to dam the river despite all efforts to break them 
                  apart, officials warned that villages further downstream still 
                  could be flooded. 
                  <P>"There are still very many jams," Tatyana Tarasova, a 
                  spokesperson for the regional government told the 
                  <I>Associated Press</I>. "It's going to keep flooding and 
                  flooding." 
                  <P>Earlier this week as the floods threatened Yakutsk, a city 
                  of 200,000 in the eastern Siberian republic of Yakutia, 
                  emergency workers used explosives to try to destroy ice jams 
                  clogging the Lena River. Meanwhile on land, workers dumped 
                  loads of sand to reinforce dikes around the regional capital 
                  as waters rose to a record 30 feet and closed in on the city 
                  center. 
                  <P>Thousands evacuated the city, threatened this week by two 
                  waves of floodwaters. Officials even asked hospital patients 
                  who were able to go without care to leave. Others were moved 
                  to the hospital's upper floors. 
                  <P>Parts of Yakutsk and outlying districts remain flooded, 
                  making thousands homeless. A federal commission is assessing 
                  the damage to determine the amount of aid the region will 
                  need. Some 4,000 houses will need to be rebuilt. 
                  <P>On Wednesday, the death toll increased to six, with all 
                  fatalities occurring in Lensk, about 500 miles southwest of 
                  Yakutsk, as people tried to escape the rising waters that have 
                  submerged almost the entire city. 
                  <P>Every spring, as Siberia gradually begins to warm up from 
                  months of subzero temperatures, frozen rivers thaw. At the 
                  same time, snow that blankets the ground throughout most of 
                  the year begins to melt, feeding the region's rivers. The 
                  result of these two events is annual flooding. 
                  <P>But this winter temperatures hit record lows, plunging to 
                  -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit) in a cold spell 
                  that lingered for weeks. Some rivers froze solid, resulting in 
                  huge blocks of ice that now clog the natural flow. In 
                  addition, Siberia is experiencing an unusually warm spring, 
                  with snowmelt and seasonal rains pouring into the rivers 
                  faster than they can drain. 
                  <P>This year, the snowfall was particularly severe, 
                  exacerbating the current problem. With nowhere to go but up, 
                  the rivers are rising over their banks and inundating 
                  villages, causing Siberia's worst floods in a century. 
                  <P>Since May 13, when the disaster began, the floods have left 
                  almost 5,000 homes underwater in 32 towns and villages from 
                  the Volga River in European Russia to the Far East. Officials 
                  estimate that more than 80,000 people are affected. 
                  <P>On Monday (May 21), Russian President Vladimir Putin 
                  appeared on national television to urge people to remain calm. 
                  "The consequences are serious. More than 1,000 homes were 
                  affected; they were practically destroyed," he said. "We will 
                  have to put measures into effect to help people and rebuild 
                  their houses." 
                  <P>Russian media reported that most buildings in Lensk, which 
                  has a population of 27,000, were submerged. While some 12,000 
                  people have been evacuated by air or boat, many remain 
                  stranded on rooftops, waiting for helicopters to arrive and 
                  fly them to safety. <I>ITAR-TASS </I>quoted the head of the 
                  local government, Vasily Vlasov, as saying that the town would 
                  have to be rebuilt elsewhere. 
                  <P>In addition to Yakutia republic, the Irkutsk oblast, where 
                  nearly 2,000 homes are flooded, has also been severely 
                  affected by the floods. Two cities in Irkutsk have been almost 
                  completely evacuated &#8212; Kirensk and Ust-Kut. Kirensk was 
                  completely underwater and Ust-Kut was 80 percent submerged. 
                  <P>Much of the flooding has occurred in rural areas of the 
                  sparsely populated region, making delivery of medical 
                  supplies, food and drinking water difficult. In one case, a 
                  plane delivering relief supplies to Kirensk had to fly 200 
                  miles to another town. From there, officials had to deliver 
                  the goods by truck. 
                  <P>The Russian Red Cross says additional relief supplies are 
                  needed for flood victims. The organization is holding clothing 
                  and food drives, but reported that more food, water 
                  purification filters, medicines, blankets and warm clothes and 
                  footwear are needed. 
                  <P>With springtime temperatures still plunging below freezing 
                  at night, warm clothes and blankets are particularly 
                  important, said Ramsey Rayyis, an American Red Cross delegate 
                  in Russia. "It is still extremely cold here," Rayyis said. 
                  "The Russian Red Cross is trying to get to the shelters to 
                  give the people clothes and blankets so they can keep warm." 
                  <P>The American Red Cross has sent 15 tons of food to the 
                  affected area and is donating funds to allow the Russian Red 
                  Cross to purchase warm clothes, footwear, blankets and bed 
                  sheets for flood victims. 
                  <P>The last major flooding of the Lena River in Siberia 
                  occurred in 1998, forcing more than 40,000 people to evacuate.
