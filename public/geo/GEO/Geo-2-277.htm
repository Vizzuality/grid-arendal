        GLOBALIZATION</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
        <P><B><I><FONT face="Times,Times New Roman">New York, 12 July 
        1999</FONT></I>&#8212;</B>A powerful plea for a re-writing of the rules of 
        globalization&#8212;to make it work for people and not just for profits&#8212;is 
        made in the Human Development Report 1999, commissioned by the United 
        Nations Development Programme.&nbsp; 
        <P>Globalization, it says, is more than the flow of money and 
        commodities&#8212;it is the growing interdependence of the world&#8217;s people 
        through "shrinking space, shrinking time and disappearing borders." This 
        offers great opportunities for enriching people&#8217;s lives and creating a 
        global community based on shared values. But markets, it argues, have 
        been allowed to dominate the process, and the benefits and opportunities 
        have not been shared equitably.&nbsp; 
        <P>The result is a "grotesque" and dangerous polarization between people 
        and countries benefiting from the system and those that are merely 
        passive recipients of its effects.&nbsp; 
        <P>The fifth of the world&#8217;s people living in the highest income 
        countries has 86 per cent of world gross domestic product (GDP), 82 per 
        cent of world export markets, 68 per cent of foreign direct investment, 
        and 74 per cent of telephone lines. The bottom fifth, in the poorest 
        countries, has about one per cent in each category. Of the foreign 
        direct investment in developing countries and the countries of Central 
        and Eastern Europe in the 1990s, more than 80 per cent went to just 20 
        countries, mainly to China.&nbsp; 
        <P>Such disparities are glaring enough. But the Report argues that the 
        inequitable effects of globalization driven by markets and profit are 
        far wider and deeper, touching all aspects of human life.&nbsp; 
        <P>Care, "the invisible heart of human development," is threatened 
        because today&#8217;s competitive global market is putting pressures on the 
        time, resources and incentives for caring labour, without which 
        individuals do not flourish and social cohesion can break down.&nbsp; 
        <P>Breakthroughs in technology, such as the Internet, can open a fast 
        track to knowledge-based growth in rich and poor countries alike, but at 
        present benefit the relatively well-off and educated: 88 per cent of 
        users live in industrialized countries, which collectively represent 
        just 17 per cent of the world&#8217;s population. The literally well connected 
        have an overpowering advantage over the unconnected poor, whose voices 
        and concerns are being left out of the global conversation.&nbsp; 
        <P>Money also talks louder than need in defining the biotechnology 
        research agenda, says the Report&#8212;"cosmetic drugs and slow-ripening 
        tomatoes come higher on the list than a vaccine against malaria or 
        drought-resistant crops for marginal land."&nbsp; 
        <P>"Even as communications, transportation and technology are driving 
        global economic expansion, headway on poverty is not keeping pace," says 
        CNN mogul Ted Turner in a special contribution to the Report. "It is as 
        if globalization is in fast-forward, and the world&#8217;s ability to 
        understand and react to it is in slow motion."&nbsp; 
        <P>The "breakneck" speed of globalization is also making people&#8217;s lives 
        less secure, as the spread of global threats to well-being outpaces 
        action to tackle them.&nbsp; 
        <P>The East Asian financial crisis, for example, will have reduced 
        global output by an estimated US$2 trillion between 1998 and 2000, 
        putting millions of people out of work and prompting cutbacks in social 
        services all over the world. The crisis was not an isolated accident, 
        warns the Report, because financial volatility is an inherent feature of 
        globally integrated financial markets.&nbsp; 
        <P>Job insecurity is also increasing in both industrialized and 
        developing countries, in the wake of economic and corporate 
        restructuring and the dismantling of social protection&nbsp; 
        <BR>measures.&nbsp; 
        <P>Culturally, many people feel threatened by the predominantly one-way 
        flow. The single largest export industry for the United States is not 
        aircraft or cars, but entertainment.&nbsp; 
        <P>Criminals&#8212;"among the most enterprising and imaginative 
        opportunists"&#8212;are beneficiaries of globalization, with the six major 
        international syndicates believed to gross $1.5 trillion a year. And the 
        illicit trade in narcotics, weapons, labour, goods and money contributes 
        to crime and violence that threaten neighbourhoods around the 
        world.&nbsp; 
        <P>These human elements have been left out of the narrow, 
        financially-based view of globalization that has prevailed so far&#8212;an 
        omission which the <I>Human Development Report 1999</I> challenges 
        head-on: "Competitive markets may be the best guarantee of efficient 
        production but not of human development."&nbsp; 
        <P>"As long as globalization is dominated by economic aspects and by the 
        spread of markets, it will put a squeeze on human development," says 
        Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, director of the Human Development Report Office. "We 
        need a new approach to governance, one that preserves the advantages 
        offered by global markets and competition while allowing for human, 
        community and environmental resources that will ensure globalization 
        works for people and not just for profits."&nbsp; 
        <P>The Report calls for a re-writing of governance for the 21st century. 
        Its suggestions and recommendations range from the global (reform of the 
        United Nations and World Trade Organization), through the regional 
        (collective approaches by groups of countries to international 
        negotiations in trade and other areas), to the national (social 
        protection against the effects of globalization) and local (greater 
        gender balance in sharing the burden of providing care services).&nbsp; 
        <P>There is no need to wait for action, it argues. A number of changes 
        can be set in motion in the next one to three years: 
        <P>&#8226; the establishment of high-level mechanisms in individual countries 
        to coordinate policy on globalization;&nbsp; 
        <P>&#8226; faster debt relief and a redirection of aid in favour of poorer 
        countries and human development priorities;&nbsp; 
        <P>&#8226; independent legal aid and an ombudsman process to support weaker 
        countries in the World Trade Organization;&nbsp; 
        <P>&#8226; International cooperation in the fight against global crime, 
        including relaxation of bank secrecy laws;&nbsp; 
        <P>&#8226; investigation of new sources of finance for the global technology 
        revolution, such as a "bit tax" on Internet messages, and an 
        international programme for the development of technology that serves 
        the needs of poor people;&nbsp; 
        <P>&#8226; a task force to review global governance, to include not only a 
        range of countries but representatives from the private sector and civil 
        society.&nbsp; 
        <P>"The world is rushing headlong into greater integration, driven 
        mostly by a philosophy of market profitability and economic efficiency. 
        We must bring human development and social protection into the 
        equation," says Dr. Richard Jolly, coordinator of the Report. 
        "Globalization needs a human face."&nbsp; 
        <P><I>About this Report:</I> 
        <P><I>Every year since 1990, the United Nations Development Programme 
        has commissioned the Human Development Report by an independent team of 
        experts to explore major issues of global concern. The Report looks 
        beyond per capita income as a measure of human progress by also 
        assessing it against such factors as average life expectancy, literacy 
        and overall well-being. It argues that human development is ultimately 
        "a process of enlarging people&#8217;s choices."</I> 
        <P><I>This year&#8217;s Report focuses on the positive and negative aspects of 
        globalization. It argues that while many millions of people are being 
        further marginalized by their lack of access to new technologies, 
        including the Internet, growing inequalities are not inevitable. It 
        recommends, among other things, stronger social policies and actions to 
        buffer the effects of today&#8217;s "bust and boom" economy. It urges 
        policymakers to balance their concern for profits with concern for 
        people disenfranchised by the turmoil of the global 
        marketplace.&nbsp;</I>
