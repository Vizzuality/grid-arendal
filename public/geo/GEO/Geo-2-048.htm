      <CENTER><B><FONT color=#810505 size=+2>SUSTAINABLE RURAL DEVELOPMENT: 
      <BR>DRIVEN BY CAMPFIRE </B></FONT></CENTER>
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+3>D</FONT>espite developing quickly, Zimbabwe 
      has pockets of severe poverty. Under colonial rule, much of the land with 
      the least agricultural potential was designated as communal lands, where 
      the country's poorest inhabitants still struggle to survive. These areas 
      are plagued by persistent drought, with accompanying widespread soil 
      erosion, river siltation, and loss of vegetative cover. 
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+1>Binga: Portrait of Rural Life in 
      Zimbabwe</FONT><BR>People in Binga district, north-western Zimbabwe, live 
      in conditions of chronic poverty, and the combination of severe droughts 
      and recent economic recession has increased their vulnerability. A 1993 
      </B>Save the Children</B> report stated that many residents regularly do 
      not have enough grain to feed themselves. People exist on wild foods and 
      drought handouts, remittances from relatives working in towns, and often 
      from selling their remaining crops and livestock. 
      <P>Living in such precarious conditions means that if wildlife damage 
      crops or livestock, it can ruin people's very livelihoods. Elephant damage 
      is a significant factor in crop loss in many parts of the district. Not 
      surprisingly, until CAMPFIRE project money was used to build solar-powered 
      fences around agricultural land and villages, local residents were not 
      interested in conserving their wildlife, which they saw as dangerous and 
      destructive. Through CAMPFIRE, these same wild animals are now vital to 
      rural development in the district: revenues from fishing, game hunting and 
      wildlife tourism are used to supplement individual household incomes and 
      for community development projects. In 1980, before CAMPFIRE, the Binga 
      district only had thirteen primary schools and no secondary schools. By 
      1995 the district boasted some 56 primary schools and nine secondary 
      schools. 
      <P><I><B><FONT color=#810505>'Up until 1985, we were a people without 
      hope. Our children too were suffering as diseases took their toll. There 
      were no schools, no wells and no clinics. Villagers continually sought 
      help as they were engaged in a desperate struggle to survive. With 
      CAMPFIRE, we now have rural health centres within easy reach.' Chief 
      Sinakatenge, Binga district.</I></B></FONT> 
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+1>CAMPFIRE: Generating Income</FONT> 
      <P>CAMPFIRE provides a legal way for rural communities to harvest their 
      natural resources on a sustainable basis, thus enhancing their income 
      directly in several ways: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Leasing trophy hunting concessions. Over 90% of CAMPFIRE revenues 
        earned by rural communities come from foreign hunters who come to 
        Zimbabwe to hunt elephants, buffaloes, lions or other wild animals. 
        Hunters are considered the 'ultimate ecotourists' in Zimbabwe, as they 
        have a much lower impact on the environment than other tourists. In 
        addition, their presence in remote areas acts as an anti-poaching 
        deterrent, and hunters pay much higher fees than other tourists. 
        Together with district councils and the Department of National Parks and 
        Wildlife Management, CAMPFIRE community representatives determine the 
        'quota' or 'sustainable offtake' of wildlife available on communal lands 
        for hunting, and lease hunting concessions to professional safari 
        hunting companies. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Harvesting natural resources. Communities harvest and sell natural 
        products such as crocodile eggs, timber, river-sand and caterpillars. 
        Unfortunately for the communities, the CITES ban on international trade 
        in elephant products prevents them from selling hide and ivory from 
        'problem animals' - individuals which persistently raid crops or 
        threaten local residents. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Tourism. Tourists have visited Zimbabwe's rural areas for many 
        years, although the local communities were rarely involved (or benefited 
        from) tourism until a few pilot projects were set up by CAMPFIRE in the 
        early 1990's. Most revenues from tourism in Zimbabwe's communal lands 
        are generated through the leasing of sites for nature tourism, although 
        in some cases local residents run basic tourist facilities and act as 
        guides. Many more tourism plans are in the pipeline, including cultural 
        tourism, bird-watching and access to natural hot springs. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Live animal sales. In areas where wildlife populations are high, 
        district councils have begun to sell live animals to commercial game 
        reserves or national parks. In 1994, Guruve district sold ten roan 
        antelope, earning some US$50,000. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Meat cropping. Meat from wildlife is sometimes sold to neighbouring 
        communities or towns. </LI></UL>
      <P>A recent report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) estimated that 
      CAMPFIRE has increased household income in communal areas by 15-25%. At 
      the end of 1992, people in Hurungwe district received US$ 119,342 through 
      CAMPFIRE. In 1993, they received $145,519. When distributed among 
      households, CAMPFIRE revenues can provide a form of food security against 
      the frequent droughts. 
      <P>
      <P><B><I><FONT color=#810505>'Five years ago, Kanyurira ward was a 
      community of no-hopers. Since the introduction of CAMPFIRE they have built 
      a school, are building a clinic, and have purchased a tractor to plough 
      the fields. Their managerial skills have&nbsp; improved dramatically.... 
      Community meetings are fully attended and each committee keeps good 
      financial records.' Department of National Parks, 1994.</B></I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+1>Improving Infrastructure</FONT> 
      <P>CAMPFIRE revenues have been used for much-needed community development 
      projects, such as: 
      <UL>
        <P>
        <LI>drilling wells to provide clean water for residents; 
        <LI>building schools and health clinics; 
        <LI>fencing arable and residential land, as well as providing funds for 
        maintaining these fences; 
        <LI>road development and installing grinding mills </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+1>Building Capacity: Training and 
      Employment</FONT> 
      <P>A significant part of rural development is empowering people to shape 
      their own development. CAMPFIRE has not only significantly increased the 
      number of schools in remote areas - such as in Binga district - but has 
      also led to local organisations holding workshops and training in topics 
      such as bookkeeping, project planning, and other managerial and employment 
      skills; 
      <P>CAMPFIRE has also created employment in remote communal lands. Local 
      residents have gained permanent jobs in safari and tourist camps, and 
      become part-time game scouts and tourist guides. People from rural 
      communities have worked building village fences, clinics and schools. In 
      Masoka village in the Dande Communal Lands, rural women were formally 
      employed for the first time, working on CAMPFIRE projects. 
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=+1>Securing the Future: the Way Forward</FONT> 

      <P>To advance rural development efforts in Zimbabwe's communal lands, 
      further technical assistance will be needed. They also need secure land 
      tenure and rights over their wildlife. In addition: 
      <UL>
        <P>
        <LI>Wildlife utilisation must be recognised as a sustainable development 
        tool. Trophy hunting is a legitimate form of ecotourism, necessary for 
        rural development and wildlife conservation in Southern Africa. 
        International legislation will need to support this, not discriminate 
        against it. For example, the ban on trading elephant products has 
        adversely affected rural communities in Zimbabwe which have US$1.6 
        million stockpiled unsold ivory. If elephants cannot generate adequate 
        incomes for rural inhabitants, they will not survive, as impoverished 
        people will be forced to clear wildlife habitat to make way for more 
        productive land use. 
        <P></P>
        <LI>Research and technical inputs will enable rural communities to 
        attain and maximise revenues from their natural resources in other ways, 
        so that CAMPFIRE can be less dependent on trophy hunting and tourism. 
        </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=4>CAMPFIRE: Women have their say in 
      development</FONT> 
      <P>Gender issues in CAMPFIRE came to the fore during the first time that 
      CAMPFIRE household dividends were distributed in Kanyurira ward, in 
      north-eastern Zimbabwe. The term 'household' was left undefined, and the 
      district council had been informed that there were 86 households, which 
      rose to 96 by the distribution day. Women complained that some widows 
      qualified as household heads, while others didn't. In addition a 
      substantial number of married women wanted to be registered in their own 
      right, since they also worked in the fields which had been destroyed by 
      wildlife. Local women organised a meeting to resolve the issue, demanding 
      equal rights and safeguarding their role in CAMPFIRE. 
      <P>Getting women to participate adequately in community decision-making 
      has been challenging, especially as many rural women have heavy workloads, 
      and lack sufficient time and skills to become involved effectively. 
      However, most CAMPFIRE areas have women on their wildlife committees. 
      Tsholothso and Bulilima Mangwe districts are leading the way, mostly due 
      to training activities targeted at involving women in CAMPFIRE. In 
      Bulilima Mangwe for example, all the Ward Wildlife Committees have at 
      least one female member, and the Inter-Ward Wildlife Committee has a 
      female Vice Chairperson and Secretary. 
      <P><FONT color=#810505 size=3><B>Since it started in 1989, more than a 
      quarter of a million rural Zimbabweans have begun managing their natural 
      resources and guiding their own development through the Communal Area 
      Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE). This fact sheet 
      has been produced by the CAMPFIRE Association and the Africa Resources 
      Trust on behalf of the CAMPFIRE Collaborative Group.
