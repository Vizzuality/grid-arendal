face=Arial>Introduction</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The scientific and technical results of the assessment 
      phase of the Canada Country Study (CCS) are published in eight volumes - 
      six regional volumes (Arctic, Atlantic, Ontario, Pacific and Yukon, 
      Prairies, and Québec), a national sectoral volume consisting of twelve 
      papers and a cross-cutting issues volume consisting of eight papers. The 
      current document - the Executive Summary - provides a digest of the 
      material in the twelve sectoral papers in the national sectoral volume 
      (agriculture, built environment, energy, fisheries, forestry, human 
      health, insurance, recreation and tourism, transportation, unmanaged 
      ecosystems, water resources and wetlands).</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>The Issue of Climate Change</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
      Second Assessment Report concludes that the balance of evidence suggests a 
      discernible human influence on global climate. Human activities are 
      increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and these 
      changes are projected to lead to regional and global changes in climate 
      and climate-related parameters such as temperature, precipitation, soil 
      moisture and sea level.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>In order to understand how the world’s climate may 
      respond, sophisticated computer models called general circulation models 
      (GCMs), are used to simulate the type of climate that might exist when 
      global concentrations of greenhouse gases are doubled from pre-industrial 
      levels. As the initial focus has been on providing a state-of-the-art 
      assessment based on existing scientific and technical literature, the 
      results of the CCS are not based on a single climate scenario. Instead, it 
      includes the range of scenarios used as a basis for the various papers and 
      reports appearing in the scientific literature. In general, the main model 
      scenarios used come from one of five GCMs which have been developed in 
      Canada, the United States or the United Kingdom: CCC92 – Canadian Centre 
      for Climate Modelling and Analysis 2nd generation model; GFDL91 – 
      Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model (US); GISS85 – Goddard 
      Institute for Space Studies model (US); NCAR93 – National Center for 
      Atmospheric Research model (US) and; UKMO95 – UK Meteorological Office 
      model.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>When interpreting the results presented here, based on 
      these scenarios, the reader should be aware that confidence is higher in 
      the hemispheric-to-continental projections of climate change than in the 
      regional projections, where confidence remains low. It is also worth 
      noting that the majority of the identified changes in climate and, 
      therefore, the identified impacts, are projected to occur over the next 
      century, and that the average rate of warming would probably be greater 
      than any seen in the last 10,000 years. Furthermore, although future, 
      unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes (as have occurred in 
      the past) are difficult to predict, future changes may also involve 
      "surprises".</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>

      <H3><FONT color=#408080 face=Arial>Cross-Cutting Issues Link to Climate 
      Change</FONT></H3>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Introduction</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The studies comprising the Canada Country Study 
      indicate the possibility of significant implications for Canada as a 
      consequence of projected changes in climate. Our climate is variable and 
      Canadians and the economy react to it on different temporal and spatial 
      scales. In addition to regional and sectoral impacts, there are a number 
      of concerns related to climate change that are multidisciplinary in nature 
      and broad in scope. These are called cross-cutting issues and highlights 
      of the key findings are identified in this executive summary.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Costing the Adaptations and Residual Impacts of 
      Climate Change</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The issue of identifying the costs of impacts and 
      adaptations to climate change was highlighted as an important aspect of 
      the CCS. Very few studies exist which definitively quantify the costs of 
      adaptation to, and residual impacts from, the projected climate change for 
      Canada. There are methodological issues regarding attempts to assess the 
      various impacts of climate change and account for them in monetary terms. 
      Values cited by the IPCC of some percentage of GDP (i.e. 1-2% of GDP 
      assuming a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 2050 and a mean 
      global warming of 2.5oC) reflect predominately estimates for the U.S. and 
      extrapolations thereof. There are other methodological issues regarding 
      aggregation of costs across individuals, sectors and regions, as well as 
      across time, and the disregard for the cost of adapting to a changing 
      climate and for the social value of most non-market goods and services. 
      Finally, there are many uncertainties in the timing and magnitude of 
      climate change that affect the results.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Extreme Weather Events</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Small changes in the mean climate or climate 
      variability can produce relatively large changes in the frequency of 
      extreme events with a small change in variability having a stronger effect 
      than a similar change in the mean. At this time, there remains 
      considerable uncertainty regarding projections of changes in flooding and 
      other extreme events, the implications, should these changes occur, 
      warrants consideration of the possible impacts. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Storms</I>: It is not clear at this time whether 
      extra-tropical storms will become stronger or weaker under climate change. 
      Intuitively, however, one would expect more frequent and more intense 
      convective activity in a warmer world. In addition, climate models suggest 
      an increase in the probability of intense precipitation with increased 
      greenhouse gas concentrations. Changes in the number or geographic 
      distribution of convective storms (severe thunderstorms producing hail, 
      lightning, tornadoes, heavy rain and strong winds), however, remain a 
      difficult issue for GCMs due to their small scale.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Extreme temperature events</I>: In a warmer 
      climate, it is expected that heat waves would become more frequent, while 
      cold spells would become rarer. Premature structural failure due to 
      deterioration over months and years could be accelerated where increased 
      occurrences of such things as hours of sunshine, temperature extremes, and 
      frequency of combined wind and rain are anticipated.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Floods and droughts</I>: New results reinforce the 
      view that variability associated with the enhanced hydrological cycle 
      translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/or floods in some 
      places and less severe droughts and/or floods in other places. In those 
      areas where the length of dry spells and the severity of droughts are 
      projected to increase, concerns are heightened regarding potential impacts 
      on water availability and vegetative growth. Conversely, where 
      precipitation intensity increases or other climate factors increase the 
      potential for flooding, the flooding of low-lying homes, docks and port 
      facilities as well as stresses on water distribution and sewage systems 
      caused by projected increases in sea level, extreme precipitation, and 
      spring ice jams on rivers is a major concern. </FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Integrated Air Issues</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Ecosystems, agriculture, human health and other 
      sectors and regions will not be impacted by climate change acting in 
      isolation, but also by other atmospheric conditions such as stratospheric 
      ozone depletion, acidic deposition, smog (mainly ground-level ozone), 
      suspended particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants. However, 
      atmospheric scientists and decision makers in Canada have largely 
      addressed these issues individually resulting in single-issue policies 
      such as the Montreal Protocol to ban stratospheric ozone-depleting 
      substances.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>It is now recognized that climate change has the 
      potential to exacerbate the other air issues. Excess greenhouse gases and 
      projected higher temperatures can be expected to alter atmospheric 
      chemistry, especially through interactions between the key greenhouse 
      gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), 
      chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone (O3), as well as the most important 
      oxidants (hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)), and other 
      trace gases/particles that are involved in one or more of the other five 
      air issues.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Examples of effects of climate change on the other air 
      issues:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Stratospheric ozone</I>: Carbon dioxide contributes 
      to modification of the temperature structure of the atmosphere, including 
      a projected cooling of the higher atmosphere (i.e. the stratosphere). 
      Normally, less ozone is destroyed if the stratosphere is cooler, so the 
      effect of increased atmospheric CO2 is to decrease ozone depletion. 
      However, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to cause 
      further cooling of the lower stratosphere and this could enhance the 
      formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in some regions, convert 
      potential ozone-depleting species to their active forms and, thereby, 
      potentially intensifying ozone depletion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Acidic deposition</I>: Climate warming would 
      increase the physical and chemical transformation rates of primary and 
      secondary acidifying materials. The general circulation of the atmosphere 
      and precipitation patterns are expected to change, and the overall 
      tropospheric reactions and instability would change affecting the acid 
      rain issue. These changes are expected to alter the transport trajectories 
      of acidifying gases and the subsequent deposition patterns and regional 
      concentrations. Summertime emissions of sulphur and nitrogen compounds 
      from power plants could increase because of increased demand for air 
      conditioning of buildings and automobiles. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is 
      also produced, which is a strong oxidant and catalyst in the production of 
      sulphuric acid, thereby increasing the acidic deposition.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Smog</I>: Natural and anthropogenic emissions of 
      several pollutants (e.g. NOx and VOCs) and particulate matter are 
      sensitive to weather conditions. For example, VOCs released from fuel 
      tanks, solvent use and chemical plants are more volatile at high 
      temperatures. Also, nitrogen compounds emitted by soil microbes and VOCs 
      from vegetation are temperature dependent. Climate change is also expected 
      to increase the potential for smog episodes as a result of increased 
      frequency of hot summer days.<BR>Conversely, other air issues also have 
      effects on climate change:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Stratospheric ozone</I>: Decreased ozone in the 
      stratosphere results in reduced flux of ozone to the upper troposphere 
      where it acts as a greenhouse gas. A thinner ozone layer allows more UV-B 
      radiation to penetrate into the lower atmosphere, where it increases the 
      production of OH radical (a primary sink for methane, a greenhouse gas 
      about 20 times more powerful than CO2). Thus, destruction of stratospheric 
      ozone could lead to a decrease in the rate of climate warming.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Acidic deposition</I>: Precursors of acidic 
      precipitation (SO2 and NOx) oxidize in the atmosphere and form sulphate 
      and nitrate aerosols. These particles reflect some solar radiation back to 
      space, causing negative radiative forcing (climate cooling).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Suspended particulate matter</I>: Some aerosols 
      such as soot are efficient light absorbers and cause slight warming, the 
      net (direct and indirect) global mean radiative forcing of anthropogenic 
      aerosols is negative and the magnitude is significant. Some studies 
      suggest that, on a global average, anthropogenic sulphate particles mask 
      about 25% of the warming caused by CO2 and other GHGs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><B>Extra-Territorial Influences</B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Most of the studies highlighted earlier and in the 
      other volumes focused on the potential climate change impacts in Canada. 
      Canada, however, is a member of a family of nations and Canadians have 
      interests and connections to people and places across the globe. 
      Therefore, the effects of climate change beyond Canada’s borders also 
      needs to be considered. Issues of international trade, security (both food 
      security and military security) and international migrations are 
      highlighted.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>International Trade</I>: The effects of climate 
      change on international prices and supply and demand could have as much 
      effect on Canada as the first and second order impacts of climate change 
      in Canada itself. Although climate change will affect all sectors of the 
      economy, almost all of the research on climate and international trade has 
      focused on the agricultural trade. A number of models predict that 
      Canada's position on the world market as a leading agricultural exporter 
      will be improved. This is both because climate changes are projected to 
      improve overall yields in Canada and because Canadian producers will fare 
      better than their competitors in places such as the American Great Plains. 
      All of these model outcomes, however, are sensitive to assumptions about 
      levels of adaptation, costs for which are not generally accounted for in 
      these projections, and assumptions about the effect of CO2 fertilization. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The possible effects of climate change on other 
      sectors of international trade such as forestry, fisheries and energy are 
      poorly known. However, since Canada relies heavily on exports from these 
      production sectors, Canada’s trade balance is vulnerable to the projected 
      changes in climate. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>International Relations</I>: Future climate change 
      is projected to affect Canada's foreign relations in a number of ways. If, 
      as most people project, it is the developing nation's that are most 
      severely affected by anthropogenic climate change, there will likely be an 
      increase in tensions between developed and developing 
countries.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Climate change could also create new sources of 
      tension within the international community. Warmer temperatures are 
      projected to exacerbate problems of international air pollution. 
      Transboundary water management will also be affected. For example, in the 
      event of long-term drought in the central American states, a scenario 
      predicted by many GCMs, Canada can expect to face increasing pressure from 
      the US for southern diversions of water. The melting of sea ice in the 
      Northwest Passage may makes this waterway navigable. Although Canada has 
      long claimed the Northwest Passage as an internal waterway, this has never 
      been recognized by all members of the international community.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The management of international common property 
      resources is also climate sensitive and thus potentially affected by 
      climate change. For instance, the productivity of Pacific salmon is 
      strongly tied to the pattern of climate and ocean circulation in the North 
      Pacific. In the past, changes in this climatic regime have produced both 
      dramatic declines and increases in catches. When pressures have been 
      placed on the resource, there have been conflicts among fisheries 
      stakeholders, complicating international efforts to manage this resource 
      sustainably. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Food and Military Security</I>: Canada’s 
      geopolitical position buffers it from most military offenses, and its 
      abundant agricultural sector and peaceful border with the United States 
      insulates it from the vagaries of climate change-induced variations in 
      food production. Although there is considerable uncertainty as to the 
      nature of changes in extreme events as a result of climate changes, 
      projected changes in the frequency or severity of these events could lead 
      to an increase in the demand for domestic security forces to assist 
      civilian authorities in the face of natural disasters. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Also chronic, intra-national and ethnic conflicts such 
      as in Bosnia and Rwanda affect Canada and Canadians a number of ways: by 
      making the world a more dangerous place; by spilling over the boundaries 
      through acts of international terrorism; by escalating into wider 
      conflicts; by increasing demands for Canadian participation in 
      peace-keeping and diplomatic missions; and by contributing to internal and 
      international refugee problems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Environmental Migrations</I>: The effect of climate 
      change on environmental migrants coming to Canada is unknown. Estimates of 
      the number of refugees generated by projected changes in climate range as 
      high as 150 million, though only the most mobile of those could be 
      expected to make their way to Canada. This enhancement of the number of 
      international refugees would put an unprecedented strain on Canada’s 
      refugee assimilation mechanisms, though the exact cost would be impossible 
      to quantify at this time. </FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Domestic Trade and Commerce</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Research of the impacts of Canadian domestic trade 
      under climate change is quite meager and statistics about interprovincial 
      trade are generally of poor quality. As a result, potential impacts in 
      this area are quite speculative in nature. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Domestic trade and commerce is likely to intensify 
      with northern regions of Canada possibly becoming the new frontier. Large 
      population centres in the south (i.e. markets and service centers) are not 
      likely to change location as manufacturing activities are less dependent 
      on natural resource location than on manpower cost and availability of 
      services. Projected impacts on natural resources could result in shifts or 
      movements of centres of activity (e.g., agricultural opportunities, and 
      harvesting and processing centres in the forestry and fisheries 
      industries). These changes could lead to shifts in people and commerce 
      within and across regions as opportunities arise and production potentials 
      change. Concerns are being raised regarding the sustainability of 
      vulnerable communities and industries due to projected changes in the 
      availability of water as a result of projected changes in 
      climate.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Changing Landscapes</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Broad landscape-scale effects of climate change should 
      be anticipated for Canada. These impacts are expected to be driven by the 
      resulting forces of: altered and more variable hydrology, melting of 
      permafrost; rising sea levels, and the shifting and altering of ecozones. 
      Such broad-scale landscape alterations have serious implications for 
      hydrology, wildlife, biodiversity, infrastructure and transportation, 
      economic activities, cultural values and lifestyles, and the well-being of 
      Canadians.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Sustainable Development and Climate 
      Change</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>At first glance it might seem odd to suggest that 
      climate change and sustainable development represent very different ways 
      to think about global environmental problems. This has led to difficulties 
      in establishing strong working linkages between the research and policy 
      communities, both here in Canada and at the international level. Within 
      the climate change and sustainable development research communities, 
      different visions of future development are being generated. This has led 
      to problems in several key areas such as: differences in scenarios of 
      emissions, economic patterns, etc.; unequal treatment of mitigation 
      (abatement) and adaptation (vulnerability) aspects of climate change; 
      ethical concerns raised by developing countries, and; questions about the 
      relevance of science to policy making on climate change and sustainable 
      development. These visions have very different dimensions, and as long as 
      they remain separate, there is a risk of significant errors in the 
      assessments of costs and benefits of responding to climate 
      change.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Northern Subsistence and Land-Based 
      Economies</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Northern indigenous peoples, already one of the more 
      vulnerable segments of Canadian society, would be affected by ecosystem 
      shifts caused by climate change. Very little is known about the possible 
      impacts climate change might have on the northern economy which is 
      comprised of three sectors: the wage sector, transfer payments, and 
      subsistence harvesting. The types of changes anticipated to accompany 
      climate change as described, however, are likely to challenge severely the 
      capacity to adapt of many subsistence societies. The effects are likely to 
      be wide-spread, with regional variations, and attempts to modify or 
      prevent events/effects for vast northern regions are not likely to be 
      viable once the impacts begin to be felt. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Climate change may affect the distribution of animals 
      and other resources on which subsistence and land-based economies are 
      based. Under conditions of projected climate warming, multi-year ice and 
      large areas of discontinuous permafrost are expected to disappear, 
      precipitation is expected to increase on average by 20 to 30% and the 
      length of the annual frost-free period would increase. Terrestrial, 
      aquatic and marine mammals in the Arctic and subarctic live in a 
      marginally supportive physical environment and small changes in conditions 
      could have major impacts on their health and survival. The transition in 
      the north to settlement life over the last forty years has reduced, though 
      not eliminated, northern peoples’ options for traveling to new areas in 
      response to animal migrations. Loss of waterfowl and fish populations 
      would have serious implications for the subsistence economy because these 
      resources are not likely be replaced by other wild food 
sources.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Thermal expansion of the ocean coupled with melting 
      glaciers and ice sheets are projected to raise mean sea levels about 50 cm 
      from the present to the end of the 21st century. Such changes in sea level 
      are expected to have effects on the Arctic’s coastal settlements, and 
      costly measures may be needed to protect them from flood damage, if indeed 
      they can even be protected. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Climate change may affect the validity of traditional 
      knowledge and local adaptations. For example, hunters, fishers and 
      trappers depend on detailed local knowledge of animal distributions and 
      behaviour, snowfall patterns, and timing of freeze-up and break-up. 
      Climate change can play havoc with the use of such knowledge by making 
      locational knowledge unreliable. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>Climate change may interfere with wildlife harvests, 
      thus resulting in diet-related problems and medical costs through elevated 
      levels of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and vitamin-deficiency 
      disorders. As the consumption of fresh meat in the diet has declined, the 
      nutrients formerly provided by this diet are not been replaced by the new 
      food choices. This is thought to be the major mechanism behind the virtual 
      epidemic of obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes mellitus among 
      northern populations. The pursuit of subsistence harvesting demands a high 
      level of physical fitness. As members of subsistence societies fall prey 
      to modern diseases they are less able to hunt for wildlife and so 
      contribute to their family’s welfare.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>A warmer climate would result in melting permafrost, 
      the thawing of wastes and greatly increasing the possibility of 
      contaminating water resources. The increase of ultraviolet-B radiation 
      caused by thinning of the ozone layer in the Arctic stratosphere is a real 
      threat to human and animal health as well as to productivity of 
      terrestrial and marine vegetation.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT color=#408080 face=Arial>Science Gaps and Rommendations for 
      Further Research</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>On a national basis, we need to fill science gaps. We 
      need to predict with higher confidence the impacts of climate change on 
      Canada's landscapes, on physical and biological processes, and on our 
      socio-economic sectors so that we can develop adaptation strategies to 
      deal where possible with such impacts. To put this into a societal 
      context, we must turn such physical and biological changes into 
      socio-economic values (costs and benefits).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Costing Research</I>: Develop a true benchmark 
      estimate of the costs over time of adaptation to, and residual impacts 
      from, climate change for Canada (e.g., estimating a time profile of 
      marginal costs of CO2 emissions). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Extreme weather events</I>: Develop and maintain 
      databases related to the costs of and adaptations to natural hazards; 
      develop climate change scenarios based upon real case studies of extreme 
      events, as well for assumed reductions in the return periods of these 
      events; assess how Canadians perceive their risks related to natural 
      hazards and climate change in order to better understand how adaptive 
      decisions are made.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Climate Change and Other Air Issues</I>: Conduct an 
      integrated assessment of the climatic effects of all gaseous and 
      particulate emissions, the physical and chemical processes involved, the 
      effects on socioeconomic systems and ecosystems, and the various control 
      strategies on all of the air issues; assess the most cost effective and 
      socially acceptable control measures for each air issue; assess the 
      possible effects of other air issues on the frequencies and intensities of 
      extreme weather events; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Climate Change and Other Non-Climatic Factors</I>: 
      Use an integrated approach to study the impacts of multiple stresses on 
      human health, socio-economic sectors, and ecosystems. Studies should 
      consider climate change as one of many factors which determine the overall 
      response. For example, projected population changes and associated 
      changing land-use and air and water quality will continue to influence the 
      health and existence of natural and human systems. Impacts and adaptation 
      studies should include consideration of competing interests, current 
      policies and boundary demands. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Indirect, extraterritorial effects</I>: Assess the 
      indirect links between climate change and international trade regimes and 
      policies on specific economic sectors in Canada such as agriculture, 
      forestry, fisheries and energy; conduct further work on the effects on 
      Canada of environmental refugees displaced by climate change.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Domestic trade and commerce</I>: Assess how 
      patterns of human settlement in Canada would be affected by changes in 
      domestic flows of trade and commerce under climate change; improve 
      input-output analysis capabilities with availability of better quality 
      provincial economic statistics.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Changing landscapes</I>: Develop and maintain 
      databases on critical variables to improve prediction of climate change 
      impacts on regional ecosystems. Variables required include seasonal 
      averages and the degree of between-year variability in: temperature, 
      precipitation, wind and radiation; the intensity and probability of 
      extreme events including drought, storms and floods; snow cover 
      distribution, depth, extent and duration; precipitation at varying 
      elevations; the probability of short-term anomalies such as late 
      spring/summer frosts, mid-winter temperature or rain events, and intense 
      spring storms; surface heat fluxes and UV-B irradiation; sea-level 
      pressures.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Sustainable development and climate change</I>: 
      Ensure that climate change and sustainable development is explicitly 
      included in their respective research agendas; conduct integrated 
      assessments of climate change that incorporate alternative methodologies 
      that complement global scale integrated assessment models.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><I>Northern subsistence and land based economies</I>: 
      Conduct research to link available biological/ecological information on 
      the impacts of climate change to local resource use and the northern 
      economy; determine the effects of non-linear, sudden changes in climate on 
      northern regions; differentiate between the potential effects of climate 
      change in the north from the cumulative impacts of large-scale development 
      projects; determine the limits to adaptability in northern subsistence 
      economies; conduct research to develop adaptive management strategies with 
      emphasis on the resilience of social and ecological systems, and on 
      flexibility to respond to uncertainty and largely unpredictable climate 
      change; conduct research to study the issue of the health of northern 
      populations relative to the implications climate change has for the 
      long-term availability of country foods; improve knowledge on the 
      epidemiology of climate change for the north; develop methodologies to 
      estimate costs of increasing dependence on financial government support, 
      and the costs of facilitating adaptation options to encourage 
      self-reliance.</FONT></P>
