background
<P>
<P></U></B>By way of factual background Table 1 reports, for the countries of 
the CST Arab States region, basic demographic characteristics and data on 
availability of natural resources.1/
<P>
<P>There are only two demographically large countries -- <B>Egypt</B> and 
<B>Turkey</B> -- and half of the other countries have each 3 million inhabitants 
or less. But <B>population growth is rapid</B>: in 1990-95 six countries grew at 
rates between 3.3 and 5 percent, implying doubling times between 14 and 21 
years. All countries, except <B>Kuwait</B> (who experienced an exceptional 
out-migration) and <B>Somalia</B>, had growth rates above the average for 
developing countries, <I>i.e.</I> 1.88 percent. Fertility is still high in the 
region (TFRs currently reach 4.2 on average in Northern Africa and 4.4 in 
Western Asia), while crude death rates are down to 9 and 7 per 1,000 
respectively in these two sub-regions; immigration further contributes to rapid 
population increase in several countries, producing some of the highest growth 
rates in the world.
<P>
<P><B>Urbanization is rather advanced</B> in the region: 54 percent of the total 
population live in urban areas (compared to 45 percent worldwide and 38 percent 
in developing regions). With very few exceptions, urban percentages in the 
countries reviewed here vary between 45 and 97. (The region has an ancient urban 
civilization based on trade activities, which did not make the transition to a 
"modern" industry-based type of cities painless, as we shall see.) In addition 
urbanization proceeds at a <B>rapid pace</B>: during 1990-95 all countries here 
(again leaving aside <B>Kuwait</B>) had urban growth rates at or above the world 
average of 2.5 percent -- half of them between 4 and 8 percent. 
<P>
<P>Unit <B>land resources</B> are very low in the Gulf countries -- where food 
import capabilities easily obviate this problem --and in <B>Egypt</B>, where 
those capabilities are lesser (at least in <I>per caput</I> terms). With the 
exception of <B>Lebanon</B>, <B>Somalia</B> and <B>Yemen</B>, other countries' 
land resources are above the world average of 0.26 hectare per person -- 
sometimes much above. 
<P>
<P>Agriculture however meets an important limiting factor, because <B>water 
resources are at low or very low levels</B>, usually much below the world 
average of 20 cubic meters <I>per caput</I> per day. The region as a whole can 
count on less than 3 m/p/day, and 65 percent of its population has less than 
2000 m per year - or 5.5 m per day (World Bank, 1992).
<P>
<P>Finally, <I>per caput</I> <B>forest and woodland resources are also very 
limited</B>: 0.33 hectare on average, far below the world average of 0.75 
hectare (and the average falls to 0.15 hectare if Sudan and Somalia are 
excluded).

<P>in order to present national reports at the Conference. Table 2 summarizes 
the environmental issues identified by sixteen countries of the Arab States 
region (UN, 1992).2/
<P>
<P><B>2.1 Main environmental issues in the region</B>
<P>
<P>Water-related problems stand out in the general picture. All fifteen 
countries mentioned some form of <B>pollution</B> of water resources (including 
<B>salinization</B>, which the table presents separately in view of its impact 
on irrigated agriculture). Ten countries mentioned <B>scarcity</B> problems, 
<I>i.e.</I> the diminishing ratio of renewable water flow per person (regardless 
of water quality), which leads some countries to draw on non-renewable reserves 
or engage in costly desalination systems (see Section 4 below).
<P>
<P>These problems are interrelated. On one side, scarcity fosters pollution as 
the flow becomes insufficient to dissolve the growing wastes and residues of 
human activities, or as sea water intrudes in overexploited groundwater 
reserves. On the other, pollution enhances scarcity whenever minimum standards 
of water quality are no longer met (poor quality water is as good as no water at 
all). 
<P>
<P>The other prominent class of problems reported is that regarding soil 
resources:
<P>
<P>- Thirteen countries complained about <B>soil erosion</B>, often to the point 
of desertification.3/ This is an expected pattern, considering that virtually 
all countries of the region are affected by arid or semi-arid climatic 
conditions (and include large desert areas to start with). 
<P>
<P>- Ten countries mentioned the <B>pollution</B> of soil resources. Although 
one might have expected oil and other industries to be the main source of this 
problem, agricultural chemical residues actually are the most frequently cited 
-- an understandable pattern in areas which heavily depend on irrigation.
<P>
<P>- In nine countries, the growth of human settlements (in particular, 
urbanization) had resulted in the <B>loss of arable land</B> to housing and 
infrastructure.
<P>
<P><B>Marine resources</B> also are a widespread concern, both for countries 
bordering the Mediterranean -- by all accounts a highly polluted sea because of 
its almost closed configuration and of the high concentration of populations and 
industries on its banks -- and for those along the Gulf with its fragile coastal 
soils and ecosystems (viz. mangroves or coral reefs) and intense oil industry 
and shipping activities.
<P>
<P>Another noteworthy class of issues has to do with <B>urban environments</B> 
and their living conditions. The concentration of population appears to often 
give rise to unmanageable problems, <I>e.g</I>. for housing development, waste 
management, water supply, air pollution under the impact of industries.

<P><B>2.2 Population aspects of environmental issues</B>
<P>
<P>As suggested by Table 2, demographic factors are sometimes evoked by 
countries in connection with their environmental problems. Yet two countries 
only mention population growth as a negative factor on a general level. For 
<B>Tunisia</B>, rapid population growth "can only have a negative effect of 
often limited natural resources and the state of the environment". For 
<B>Sudan</B>, rapid population growth and negative GDP growth "set the scene"; 
the population factor contributes to producing a serious crisis, <I>e.g.</I> in 
that it has led to the clearing of more areas for agriculture.
<P>
<P>When it comes to population growth in the specific form of 
<B>urbanization</B>, however, almost all countries appear to be concerned: 
<P>
<P>- <B>Morocco</B> (population pressure in urban areas and its impact on living 
conditions, in particular the proliferation of unplanned settlements resulting 
in slums and loss of arable land);4/ 
<P>- <B>Algeria</B> (population growth and its related problems such as housing 
and unemployment);
<P>- <B>Tunisia</B> (settlements on the shores are in part responsible for 
imbalances in coastal areas and marine ecosystems);
<P>- <B>Egypt</B> (urban encroachment on agricultural lands);
<P>- <B>Sudan</B> (migration to towns, uncontrolled urban growth);
<P>- <B>Djibouti</B> (rapid urban population growth);
<P>- <B>Saudi Arabia</B> (rapid urbanization is one of the causes of coastal 
destabilization and pollution; need to limit urban expansion in industrial 
cities);
<P>- <B>Yemen</B> (galloping urbanization and rural exodus);
<P>- <B>Oman</B> (galloping urban development);
<P>- <B>Jordan</B> (need to control sites of human settlements to safeguard 
agricultural lands);
<P>- <B>Syria</B> (rapid population growth implies increasing demand for 
housing, which in turn impinges negatively on forests and farmlands);
<P>- <B>Lebanon</B> (demographic pressure is manifest in urban areas; population 
displacement as well as housing problems have arisen as a result of war; the 
urbanization of agricultural areas has led to a food deficit).
<P>
<P>A different type of issues is indirectly but strongly linked with population 
growth at the national and urban levels, namely those arising from growing human 
numbers in the face of fixed water resources. Such problems are noted by several 
countries, but usually without explicit mention of population factors (the 
exception being <B>Egypt</B>, who points to rising demographic pressures and 
diminishing water resources).
<P>
<P>For the observer population pressure - in conditions of unchanging or slowly 
changing technology - also is a factor in:
<P>
<P>(a) the <B>extension of agriculture</B>, with encroachment on forests or on 
marginal lands, which accelerates degradation (<B>Morocco, Sudan</B>);
<P>(b) the <B>overexploitation of the wood cover</B> for domestic uses 
(<B>Morocco</B>);
<P>(c) <B>increased pollution</B> by domestic wastes (<B>Morocco, Tunisia, 
Oman</B>).
<P>
<P>But this connection is not explicitly made by the national reports.
<P>
<P><B>
<P>2.3 Population and environmental policies</B> 
<P>
<P>At the operational level, there is no evidence that population dimensions of 
environmental problems are specifically taken into account when it comes to 
defining objectives and strategies of the policies that address issues of 
environmental degradation or aim at preservation. Probably, demographic trends 
are taken as an unescapable aspect of the nexus of problems at hand -- at least 
in the medium term -- so it is not envisaged to try to alter them in view of 
possible benefits on the environmental side. Those countries in the region who 
do have a policy to slow down the rate of population growth (and possibly that 
of urban growth) do so for a variety of reasons that go much beyond the 
environmental sector, and indeed did not include that sector at all when these 
policies were initiated.
<P>
<P>On the other hand, there would be room to do much more in terms of using 
population data and projections at the stage of assessing future environmental 
problems, priority issues and geographic areas, or identifying "vulnerable" 
populations in the <U>Agenda 21</U> terminology (<I>i.e.</I> populations at 
risk).
<P>
<P>Another point is worth noting for those concerned with population 
<B>advocacy</B> and <B>IEC</B> within the context of population policies. Many 
of the countries covered here state their reliance on environmental education as 
one of the instruments to halt in the long run environmental degradation 
(<B>Morocco, Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, 
Turkey</B>). Most of these mention the school curricula and mass media as the 
main instruments for raising awareness in this sector. This deserves attention 
from the population IEC viewpoint, since programmes in this area provide 
opportunities to introduce considerations on the linkages between population 
dynamics and environmental change.

<P>-- = zero or negligible N.B. Totals may not tally due to rounding.
<P>
<P>countries the impact of degradation other than of the "light" type is 
unusually strong. When the severity of land degradation is taken into account, 
the picture becomes the following:
<P>
<P>- <B>Iraq</B> is by far the most affected country;
<P>- next comes a group comprising <B>Turkey, Syria, Tunisia</B> and 
<B>Jordan</B> (in descending order); then <B>Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia</B> and 
<B>Oman</B>;
<P>- at the other end of the classification <B>Egypt</B> and <B>Lebanon</B> are 
the least affected countries.
<P>
<P><B>3.2 Types of degradation</B>
<P>
<P><B>Soil erosion</B> under the action of <B>winds</B> is the main form of land 
degradation in this region (while in the rest of the world erosion caused by 
water -- rain, streams and floods -- is the major problem). But water erosion is 
important in <B>Tunisia, Sudan, Yemen</B> and <B>Oman</B>, and dominant in 
<B>Morocco, Lebanon</B> and <B>Turkey</B>.6/
<P>
<P><B>Chemical degradation</B>, which accounts for 12 percent of soil 
degradation at the global level, has a much higher impact in some of the 
countries reviewed here (<B>Egypt, Iraq, Syria</B> and <B>Algeria</B> in 
particular). This class of problems essentially includes salinization (typical 
of irrigated areas, and a major issue in this region), loss of soil nutrients7/ 
and pollution. Finally, physical degradation has little or no incidence, except 
in <B>Iraq</B>.8/
<P>
<P><B>3.3 Causes of degradation</B>
<P>
<P>GLASOD has also identified for each degraded area the main "causative factor" 
of the local problems:
<P>
<P>- <B>Overgrazing</B> has a much greater impact in this region than at the 
global level (35 percent of the total extent of degradation worldwide, while 
here 13 countries surpass that mark and seven reach at least 75 percent, with 
<B>Saudi Arabia, Libya</B> and <B>Jordan</B> at the top of the list). This is 
because the region is one of extensive livestock production based on natural 
rangeland, in dry climate conditions.
<P>
<P>- <B>Deforestation</B>, by contrast, plays a much lesser role here than 
average (36 percent worldwide), the exceptions being <B>Lebanon</B> and 
<B>Turkey</B>. 
<P>
<P>The role of population dynamics <I>vis-à-vis</I> other factors in 
deforestation is a much debated issue. In the Near East and North Africa, forest 
clearance appears to have occurred mostly under the pressure of needs for more 
cropland and pastures; in addition, forest degradation occurs because of excess 
livestock grazing in wooded areas as well as collection of wood for human use, 
especially fuel.
<P>
<P>- <B>Land mismanagement</B> (Table 3: column <I>agricultural activities</I>) 
has an unusually high impact in five countries (<B>Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, 
Iraq</B> and <B>Syria</B>) if values for these are compared with the world 
average of 28 percent. 
<P>
<P>
<P>This factor includes <I>e.g.</I> the cultivation of fragile soils, undue 
reduction of fallow, irrigation of inadequate soils, unwise use of fire and 
diversion of rivers for irrigation. 
<P>
<P>Such practices occur only under constraining circumstances, such as the 
saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to 
cultivate inadequate (<I>e.g.</I> shallow or steep) soils, plough fallow land 
before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops from 
unsuitable soils by irrigation.
<P>
<P><B><A name=water></A>4. <U>A close-up on water resource issues</U></B>
<P>
<P>Because of the water scarcity problem, population growth "is at the heart of 
the problem of semi-arid development <I>[...]</I> The fundamental importance of 
water both for habitability and for rural access to biomass for food, fodder, 
fuelwood and timber makes water scarcity a crucial problem in the struggle for a 
higher quality of life of poor rural populations"; where habitability is reduced 
by water shortages, emigration is a habitual consequence (Falkenmark, 1990).
<P>
<P>The seriousness of the water issue in this region is well known: "the 
tightest situation faces the countries of the Middle East and North Africa. Out 
of twenty countries in the region, eleven are already using more than half their 
water resources. Libya, and all the Arabian peninsula save Oman, are using more 
than 100 percent. They are relying on expensive desalinization of sea- water, or 
drawing on underground reserves of fossil water that cannot be replenished. And 
populations in the region are projected to double, treble or in some cases more 
than quadruple before stabilizing" (Harrison, 1992).
<P>
<P>In effect, situations in 2025 have been projected based on recent population 
projections and renewable water supply estimates (Engelman and LeRoy, 1993) 
using the classical scale of levels of competition for water9/. Results show 
that:
<P>
<P>- <B>Lebanon</B> would be one of the 15 countries (worldwide) suffering from 
<I>water stress</I>.
<P>
<P>- <B>Egypt, Morocco</B> and <B>Syria</B> would be among the 9 countries 
suffering from <I>water scarcity</I>.
<P>
<P>- <B>Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia, Somalia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates</B> and <B>Yemen</B> would be 
among the 22 countries meeting the <I>water barrier</I> before 2025.10/
<P>
<P>Country perspective studies confirm this picture. In <B>Jordan</B>, it has 
been estimated that as the population continues to grow and industry and 
agriculture continue to develop, demand for water will exceed availability in 
the near future (Ahmad, 1989). An important factor is the geographical 
distribution of population: while domestic needs are intrinsically modest (a few 
cubic meters per person p.a.) the concentration of population through 
urbanization can create problems, as is the case in the Amman-Zarqa area which 
concentrates some 60 percent of the national population. In <B>Qatar</B>, water 
scarcity is identified as the main problem; in the absence of permanent surface 
water, agriculture is almost entirely dependent on irrigation from pumped 
groundwater: it is estimated that Qatar aquifers will be depleted in 20 to 30 
years at recent rates of groundwater withdrawal. Further, with increasing urban 
and rural development, groundwater pollution (viz. nitrates) is a clear 
probability (UNEP, 1987). By and large, similar considerations apply to all 
countries in the region.
<P>
<P>Indeed, one should not focus exclusively on water scarcity. <B>Pollution</B> 
-- with its implications for human health -- usually is part of the water 
resources issue, and can indeed be the leading problem. <B>Syria</B> is a case 
in point: the insufficiency of sanitary sewage disposal systems and increasing 
dumping of industrial wastes have damaged the Euphrates, Oronte and Barrada 
river basins. In addition, overpumping of aquifers for irrigation has brought 
about saltwater intrusions in the coastal plains.
<P>
<P>Let us now consider the respective roles of agriculture, industry and 
domestic uses of water, as reported in Table 4.11/

<P>
<P>The region is characterized by: (a) a high predominance of agriculture as a 
water user, due to the absolute need to irrigate most of agricultural lands: all 
but four countries are above the world average and five are above 90 percent; 
(b) a very low share of industrial uses: all but two countries are below half of 
the world average; and (c) a more diversified situation regarding domestic uses, 
which in some cases are at very low levels. 
<P>
<P>The implication of these patterns is that there still is quite some 
<B>potential for increases in water demand</B>, as economies diversify and 
living standards rise. Unless large gains are made in efficient use of 
irrigation water and conservation or rehabilitation of damaged irrigated areas, 
the crunch is likely to severely damage economic competitivity in addition to 
health and the quality of life. 
<P>
<P><B><A name=egypt></A>5. <U>Egypt: a short country profile</B></U> 
<P>
<P>Egypt is an extremely arid country with limited land and water resources.12/ 
Less than 3 percent of its area is cultivated because of <B>water shortage</B>. 
The Nile is the country's basic life- sustaining system, but the available water 
is already fully utilized, mainly for agricultural and human use. 
<P>
<P><B>Water quality problems</B> arise easily given this saturation. 
Salinization and waterlogging affect the productivity of crop land. Aquifers are 
threatened with salinization and pollution. Irrigation canals and drains 
increasingly suffer from weeds and the accumulation of pesticides.13/ Urban 
areas and archaeological sites are affected by rises in water tables due to poor 
drainage. Industrial wastewater and urban sewage are discharged into drains with 
little or no treatment because of the shortage of wastewater treatment capacity 
(and of operation and maintenance problems in existing plants). Effluents thus 
endanger the health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of people. WHO 
statistics show about 90,000 annual recorded deaths linked to water-borne 
diseases. 
<P>
<P>Egypt also suffers from <B>air pollution</B> problems in the main urban 
areas, where over half of the population resides. Concentrations of carbon 
monoxide, lead and sulphur dioxide in these areas and other mixed 
residential-industrial areas are well above acceptable levels. Due to widespread 
energy inefficiency, CO2 emissions are unnecessarily high. The concentration of 
airborne dust in Cairo exceeds international standards by a factor of 10. In 
industrial areas it reduces solar radiation, damaging local vegetation. By 
damaging limestone monuments, air pollution also affects the country's rich 
cultural heritage.
<P>
<P>The economic consequences of these problems are great, especially for the 
primary sector. Over one million hectares of irrigated land suffer from 
salinization, meaning huge losses in <B>forgone output. Fisheries</B> output is 
reduced in some areas and has generally decreased in value because of excessive 
contents of toxic substances.14/ Urban drinking <B>water treatment</B> is 
becoming increasingly costly. And the <B>tourism</B> potential is affected as 
the cultural and natural heritage deteriorates.
<P>
<P>One should also mention a number of problems which threaten biological 
diversity. Oil pollution damages coastal resources (coral reefs, mangroves, 
fisheries, birds, beaches etc.) both along the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. 
Tourism also has been seen (<I>e.g.</I> on the Red Sea or in the Aswan area) to 
cause habitat degradation if not properly managed.
<P>
<P>The role of population growth in some of these processes is unquestionable. 
Land degradation, for instance, has much to do with accelerated agricultural 
intensification and "the pressure of an increasing population combined with the 
scarcity of cultivable land, leading farmers to ask more of the land than it can 
yield" (Kishk, 1986). And the pressure increases all the more rapidly as the 
spatial growth of human settlements, especially cities, takes a direct toll on 
the surrounding land resources: based on FAO data it has been estimated for 
instance that "between 1973 and 1985 Egypt lost 13 percent of her farmland to 
urban sprawl" (Harrison, 1992). It is commonly said that the land developed 
thanks to the Aswan Dam merely compensates for that lost to urbanization. In 
effect, Egypt's arable and permanent crop land in 1993 (2.8 million hectares) 
was the same as in 1974-76 and less than that in 1969-71 (FAO, 1995).
<P>
<P>Of course, impact on the environment varies from one category of population 
to the other, depending on lifestyles.15/ Overall, however, the mere increase in 
concentration of human numbers in urban areas overwhelms existing 
infrastructures and absorbs more and more investment resources. 
<P>
<P>Egypt certainly exemplifies, on a large scale, many of the 
population-environment problems of the region, especially those arising from 
population pressure on agricultural resources. It might seem that the countries 
with an oil-based economy are much better off; but in reality, the populations 
of those countries -- relatively small but concentrated in the vicinity of 
industrial sites -- suffer disproportionately from the impact of industrial 
activities on a fragile natural environment. And all have in common the severe 
problem of water resources.
<P>
<P><B><A name=link></A>6.</B> <B><U>Population-environment linkages and 
population programmes in the Arab States region</B></U>
<P>
<P>Several years ago already UNFPA, in its <I><U>Handbook of Policy 
Guidelines</I></U>, stated its interest for studying selected aspects of the 
population-environment nexus, namely: 
<P>
<P>- interactions between population growth or distribution and priority 
environmental problems (including desertification, deforestation, water 
pollution, overuse of lands, urban overcrowding etc.);
<P>
<P>- the consequences of deteriorating environments on infant mortality, 
maternal morbidity, food security, employment, migration etc.;
<P>
<P>- women as "agents and change" and protectors of the environment;
<P>
<P>- the interaction of population factors with other factors of environmental 
change;
<P>
<P>- the population-supporting capacity of agricultural lands in developing 
countries, particularly in areas of low food security;
<P>
<P>- methods to integrate population concerns in planning for sustainable 
development;
<P>
<P>- the problems of especially vulnerable groups (children, landless families, 
indigenous peoples etc.) at the local level;
<P>
<P>- the adaptation of existing methodologies to better conceptualize and 
communicate population-environment problems for use in IEC activities.
<P>
<P>The <I><U>Handbook</I></U> further indicates that "country case studies are 
to be given special attention because they afford the opportunity of examining 
linkages between population and the environment in different contexts" with 
regard to political, natural resources and economic circumstances.
<P>
<P>We must also refer to the priorities set by the <U><I>Agenda 21</U></I> in 
the area of demographic dynamics and sustainability (Chapter 5). The focus is on 
the first programme area, namely "Developing and disseminating knowledge 
concerning the links between demographic trends and factors and sustainable 
development", where the following activities are proposed (UN, 1993):
<P>
<P>(a) "Identifying the interactions between demographic processes, natural 
resources and life support systems, bearing in mind regional and subregional 
variations deriving from, <I>inter alia</I>, different levels of development";
<P>
<P>(b) "Integrating demographic trends and factors into the ongoing study of 
environmental change <I>[...]</I> first, to study the human dimensions of 
environmental change and, second, to identify vulnerable areas";
<P>
<P>(c) "Identifying priority areas for action and developing strategies and 
programmes to mitigate the adverse impact of environmental change on human 
populations, and vice versa".
<P>
<P>We have seen that the countries of the Arab States region are widely affected 
by environmental problems, many of which are ascribable at least in part to 
population factors. There is, therefore, ample scope for activities along these 
lines, for which UNFPA support could be considered. 
<P>
<P>A first type of activities, aiming at improving the understanding of 
processes at work, consists in retrospective studies, such as: 
<P>
<P>1 - Assess the <B>role of population dynamics and other factors</B> with 
respect to prevailing trends in water supply issues, land degradation, 
deforestation.
<P>
<P>2 - Assess the <B>impact of urban expansion</B> on the state of natural 
resources (cropland, forests, water).
<P>
<P>3 - Assess <B>changes in the quality of urban environment</B> (access to 
water and sanitation, infrastructure, equipment) and assess their reciprocal 
causal relationships with the demographic<B> dynamics of the settlements</B>.
<P>
<P>
<P>Perhaps it is best to mention at this stage an important requisite for the 
development of further activities in the policy sphere:
<P>
<P>4 - <B>Advocacy</B>, <I>i.e.</I> the use of classical information techniques 
to <B>raise the awareness</B> of government and relevant public agencies staff 
regarding concrete, priority reciprocal linkages of population dynamics and 
environmental change at the national and sub-national levels (in light of the 
knowledge gained through the above activities), and achieve a clear recognition 
of the need to develop policies that take those linkages into accounts.
<P>
<P>Next comes a group of activities more practically oriented towards policy 
formulation. Some are geared to establish necessary information bases and 
current diagnoses, such as:
<P>
<P>5 - Based on country characteristics, identify specific environmental 
<B>indicators integrating population dimensions</B>. Look specifically into the 
feasibility of <B>spatially disaggregated</B> indicators. Set up <B>data 
collection and processing</B> systems. Where feasible, build retrospective time 
series for these indicators as a starting point for analysis.
<P>
<P>6 - Assess current dimensions of population pressure on water resources: 
count <B>population by watershed area</B>, assess broad <B>patterns of use by 
sector</B>.
<P>
<P>7 - <B>Identify</B> the <B>vulnerable populations</B> with regard to specific 
environmental issues, <I>e.g.</I> pollution, water supply problems, 
deforestation. (Even in the case of a localized problem, those populations may 
be quite different from those living in the area where the problem arises.)
<P>
<P>Other studies are more of the "policy study" type in the strict sense, 
<I>i.e.</I> geared to assess the implications of alternative courses of action 
or alternative scenarios regarding exogenous variables; for instance:
<P>
<P>8 - <B>Project</B> population <B>impact on various environmental goods</B> 
(<I>e.g.</I> cropland, building areas, water resources, forests) based on 
scenarios of population growth, urbanization, consumption patterns. Illustrate 
potential differences arising from <B>alternative demographic scenarios</B>.
<P>
<P>All these activities are meant to produce utilizable results in the policy 
making context (<I>i.e.</I> the second programme area of the <U><I>Agenda 
21</U></I>, namely the formulation of integrated environment and development 
policies taking into account demographic trends and factors). Specific 
assistance for the latter purpose will often be valuable, mainly in the form of:
<P>
<P>9 - <B>Capacity building</B>, <I>e.g. </I>through interdisciplinary workshops 
making use of practical <B>exercises in formulating environment and development 
strategies</B>.
<P>
<P>Finally, it is worth mentioning again that the linkages between population 
and environmental change can be an interesting addition to traditional 
population education themes:
<P>
<P>10 - <B>IEC activities</B> addressing the general public could derive 
arguments <I>inter alia</I> from those linkages, especially where the impact of 
environmental degradation on people's health and living conditions is more 
acutely felt. Field experiences in communication campaigns focused on such 
themes, built upon assessments of the people's perceptions regarding 
environmental change, its causes and consequences, can be utilized with profit 
in new contexts.
<P>
<P>Needs for these various kinds of inputs to country policies should be 
systematically assessed in the context of programming at the country level. In 
addition, there would be great value in undertaking country activities, such as 
those suggested above, in a coordinated manner in groups of countries that share 
the same issues and therefore can benefit both from one another's experience, 
both in data collection/analysis and in applying thematic knowledge to policy 
making.

<CENTER>Regional patterns of land degradation</U></B></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The extent of the degradation problem and its patterns vary notably among 
regions:
<P>
<P>-<B> Africa</B> has 25% of wasteland (the highest proportion among regions), 
12% lightly or moderately degraded and 4% strongly or extremely degraded land 
(also the highest proportion). The main type of degradation by far is the 
<B>loss of topsoil</B> (76% of the degraded area) followed by the <B>loss of 
soil nutrients</B> (9%).
<P>
<P>(<B>Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Lesotho, Morocco and 
Rwanda</B> are particularly affected.) 
<P>
<P>- <B>North and Central America</B> has 6% wasteland, 6% lightly or moderately 
degraded and 1% strongly degraded land. The main types of degradation are the 
<B>loss of topsoil</B> (75% of the degraded area) and <B>terrain deformation 
from water erosion</B> (16%, but 40% in Central America).
<P>
<P>(<B>Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama</B> are the most affected countries.)
<P>
<P>- <B>South America</B> has 1% wasteland, 11% lightly or moderately degraded 
and 1% strongly or extremely degraded land. The main types of degradation are 
<B>loss of topsoil from water erosion</B> (39% of the degraded area), <B>loss of 
soil nutrients</B> (28%) and <B>terrain deformation from water erosion</B> 
(12%).
<P>
<P>(<B>Brazil</B> is particularly affected.)
<P>
<P>- <B>Asia</B> has 11% wasteland, 15% lightly or moderately degraded (the 
highest proportion among regions) and 3% strongly or extremely degraded land. 
Again the main type is <B>loss of topsoil</B> (71% of the degraded area), the 
next being <B>terrain deformation</B> (16%); <B>salinization</B> (7%) is 
significant.
<P>
<P>(<B>China, India, Thailand and Vietnam</B> are the most affected countries.)
<P>
<P>- <B>Australasia</B> has 11% wasteland, 11% lightly or moderately degraded

degradation consists in the <B>loss of topsoil</B>.
<P>
<P>- <B>Europe</B> has a negligible proportion of wasteland, 22% lightly or 
moderately degraded and 1% strongly or extremely degraded land. The main types

<P>
<P>1/ The sources for Table 1 are the following. Population size and growth 
rate: UN (1994a); urban population percentage and growth rate: UN (1994b); 
cropland and forest: FAO (1995) or AGROSTAT data base; water resources: derived 
from Engelman and LeRoy (1993).
<P>
<P>2/ Such reports were presented by all countries covered by the CST except 
Libya, Somalia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. A report was also presented 
for Palestine, emphasizing the loss of soil resources to erosion and human 
settlements; soil pollution by agricultural and industrial wastes; water 
scarcity and pollution by domestic and agricultural wastes; loss of forest areas 
to agriculture and ensuing loss of biodiversity; and inadequate urban sewerage 
and waste disposal.
<P>
<P>3/ Desertification is only one extreme aspect of the deterioration of 
ecosystems under the combined pressure of adverse climate and agricultural 
exploitation (FAO, 1986). The United Nations Conference on Desertification, 
which popularized the word, defined it as "the reduction or destruction of the 
land's potential, finally resulting in the appearance of desert conditions" (UN, 
1977); one should use it only to designate processes which have resulted in 
desert conditions or will inevitably do so, but it is often used in the loose 
sense of land degradation in arid and semi- arid areas. The word 
"desertification" has other annoying aspects. It tells nothing on the 
<B>nature</B> of degradation, and misstates problems: "The concept of expanding 
deserts and advancing sand dunes has become the dominant image in the public's 
eye rather than <I>[...]</I> less visible and much more serious problems" 
(Liamine, 1993), in particular "more subtle, more complex, pulsating 
deteriorations <I>[...]</I> radiating out from centers of excessive population 
pressure" (Nelson, 1990). Also, it seems to designate an absolute evil, while 
for instance salinization in an irrigated area, although reversible, is a 
greater loss than that of the last inch of topsoil in a marginal area.
<P>
<P>4/ Texts between parentheses in this paragraph are taken from: UN (1992).
<P>
<P>5/ For a comparison of land degradation patterns among regions of the world, 
see the Annex.
<P>
<P>6/ Globally 83 percent of land degradation is in the form of erosion: 70 
percent mere loss of topsoil and 13 percent more severe terrain deformation.
<P>
<P>7/ Either through depletion (from cultivating poor or mediocre soils without 
sufficient fertilization) or through erosion.
<P>
<P>8/ This includes mainly soil compaction and the waterlogging of irrigated 
areas (together affecting less than 5 percent of degraded areas worldwide).
<P>
<P>9/ Population pressures under 600 persons per flow unit (P/FU; 1 FU = 1 
million cubic meters) are not considered a serious issue, although water quality 
problems and dry season supply problems may occur. Between 600 and 1000 P/FU, 
chances of more recurrent quantitative or/and qualitative supply problems 
increase notably: this is called the "<B>water stress</B>" stage. Between 1000 
and 2000 P/FU such problems are common and affect human and economic 
development; this is the "<B>scarcity</B>" stage. 2000 P/FU is seen as the 
maximum population pressure that can be handled in the present state of 
technology and management capabilities; it has been labelled "<B>water 
barrier</B>". This scale was developed from the observation of areas where both 
<I>per caput</I> supplies and resource use problems were well documented.
<P>
<P>10/ Scarcity-related concepts are indicative, in view of the varying adaptive 
capacities of countries. In particular, the water barrier concept should not be 
taken literally; even if water shortage is indeed a medium-term barrier to 
development, there is <I>a priori</I> no indication that solutions for the long 
term cannot be found. Rather than impending absolute physical limits, the 
indicator warns of <B>steeply increasing costs</B> of supply on account of 
increased investment and recurrent expenditure for water supply, treatment 
and/or re-use; in turn the cost issue points to likely <B>social</B> problems 
for cost recovery. On the other hand, "in arid conditions, the problem is more 
complex because of considerable seasonal variations in rainfall. The largest 
need for irrigation water is during the dry season when the water accessible to 
people can be as low as 10 percent of the annual flow. Even countries with an 
average competition level of only 50 <I>[P/FU]</I> have considerable allocation 
problems during the dry season"; in addition, "national figures do not reflect 
the stress on water resources quality in local areas exerted by rapid 
urbanization and industrialization" (Falkenmark and Widstrand, 1992).

from: Arab Republic of Egypt (1994).
<P>
<P>13/ "Irrigation practices and intensive agriculture <I>[lead]</I> to various 
forms of serious degradation <I>[...]</I> Soils are polluted primarily by 
pesticides, which are very intensively applied to the fields (in particular the 
half-million hectares under cotton plantations)" (Kishk, 1986).
<P>
<P>14/ Fish production has dropped by about 70 percent in Lake Maryut since the 
1970s, and Lake Manzala is similarly polluted. Nile fisheries have collapsed, as 
have Mediterranean sardine fisheries. Egypt now imports some 150,000 tons of 
fish annually.
<P>
<P>15/ In Cairo, household waste in upper-income households is about three times 
that for low-income [S. Cointreau (1984): <U>Recycling from municipal 
refuse</U>, <I>World Bank technical paper 30</I>, Washington, cited by Harrison 
(1992)].
