            <H3>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)</H3>Persistent organic 
            pollutants (POPs) include a wide range of substances: industrial 
            chemicals (such as poly-chlorinated biphenyls - PCB) and by-products 
            of industrial processes (e.g. hexachlorobenzene - HCB, and dioxins) 
            whose toxic characteristics are unintentional, and others, such as 
            pesticides (e.g. DDT) and herbicides (e.g. lindane - HCH), that are 
            designed to have toxic properties. POPs containing chlorine are 
            referred to as organochlorines. 
            <P>Interest in the presence of POPs in the Arctic environment arises 
            in particular because of the concern that indigenous peoples and 
            other northern residents depending on traditional food for all or 
            part of their diet may be adversely affected by chronic exposure to 
            these pollutants. POPs are of special concern because:

              <LI>they persist in the environment for long periods of time which 
              allows them to be transported large distances from their sources,

              biomagnify in food chains; 
              <LI>many indigenous people in the Arctic depend on traditional 
              diets that are both an important part of their cultural identity 
              and a vital source of nourishment; alternative sources of food 
              often do not exist; however, traditional diets are often high in 
              fat and POPs tend to accumulate in fatty tissue of the animals 
              that are eaten;

              from the activities associated with the production and use of

      and reduce emissions of contaminants into the environment and to promote 
      international cooperation and make a determined effort to secure support

      <P> 
      <H3>AMAP's Findings</H3>In comparison with most other areas of the world, 
      the Arctic remains a clean environment. However, the following conclusions 
      illustrate that, for some pollutants, combinations of different factors 
      give rise to concern in certain ecosystems and for some human populations. 
      These circumstances sometimes occur on a local scale, but in some cases 
      may be regional or circumpolar in extent. 
      <P><I>Sources and Pathways of POPs:</I><BR>POPs of concern in the Arctic 
      mainly originate in temperate and warmer areas of the world. Pesticides 
      that are banned or restricted in many countries continue to be used 
      extensively in agricultural and pest control applications in developing 
      countries; the environmental implications of new substances that are being 
      introduced as replacements for banned substances are not well known. 
      Industrial sources in Europe, North America and Asia also contaminate the 
      Arctic. 
      <P>There are also sources within the Arctic. These include sources at 
      military installations, such as PCBs from early warning radar sites, 
      industrial sources, such as dioxins/furans from smelters, municipal and 
      industrial waste disposal, and past use of pesticides for pest control. 
      The extent of contamination from many of these sources, and of possible 
      continuing use of restricted substances in some areas, is not well 
      documented. POPs reach the Arctic mainly via atmospheric and riverine 
      pathways. In the atmosphere, POPs travel by a series of "hops", depositing 
      from the atmosphere under cold conditions and then revolatizing when 
      temperatures increase. The Polar regions form potential cold traps for 
      these compounds. 
      <P>It is possible that transport of POPs by sea ice results in their 
      release in marginal ice areas. For example, release of particulates 
      following melting in the marginal ice areas in the Greenland and Barents 
      Seas may be an important mechanism for focusing contaminants from a wide 
      area of the Arctic into these regions. The potential for damage to 
      ecosystems is enhanced by the fact that transport pathways tend to focus 
      POPs in areas of high biological productivity.

      the Arctic of certain POPs by the large Russian rivers that flow northward 
      to the Arctic Ocean (Ob, Yenisey, Lena). This may indicate recent or 
      continuing use of banned or restricted substances, such as DDT, however 
      these data need further confirmation.</FONT>

          <TD align=left vAlign=top><I>Biomagnification in Arctic food chains 
            increases the potential threat from POPs</I><BR>Due to the processes 
            of bioaccumulation and biomagnification, POPs can reach very high 
            concentrations in top predators even when levels in air, soil and 
            water are low. Biomagnification is a process that occurs in food 
            chains where animals consume other animals for food but at the same 
            time consume all the contaminants that their prey have accumulated. 
            Since many POPs are not broken down or excreted, concentrations 
            increase with each step from prey to predator. Bioaccumulation of 
            POPs is particularly strong in Arctic marine food chains leading to 
            high levels of POPs in top predators such as seals and polar bears, 
            and ultimately man. The role of fat reserves in allowing many Arctic 
            animals to survive the cold climate, and its importance in the diet 
            of top predators including humans, further promotes the 
            biomagnification of lipid-soluble POPs. 
            <P>Studies have shown that POPs can affect the immune system and 
            lead to developmental, behavioural and reproductive effects in a 
            number of species including birds, fish and mammals. Current levels 
            of POPs found in some species in some areas are approaching or even 
            exceeding thresholds associated with these types of effects. The 
            concern for Arctic ecosystems is that effects at the individual 
            level may ultimately lead to effects at the population or community 
            level. Temporal data show that levels of some POPs in the Arctic 
            environment are not yet decreasing even though their uses have been 
            restricted for some time; in some cases levels are still rising. 
            <P><I>Intake of POPs from traditional food consumed by indigenous 
            people in the Arctic</I><BR>Species higher up the Arctic food chain 
            are consumed by indigenous peoples as part of their traditional 
            diet. POPs accumulate in the fatty tissues of many such species. The 
            diet of indigenous coastal communities tends to involve the 
            consumption of relatively high quantities of marine mammals. Inland 
            communities tend to consume more reindeer and wild meat. More 
            objective dietary assessments are required, particularly in northern 
            Russia, to better estimate exposure risk to indigenous communities 
            from the consumption of traditional country foods. 
            <P>Because the periods of fetal development and development in 
            children during the early years of life are those associated with 
            the greatest vulnerability to toxic substances, contaminant intakes 
            by pregnant women and children are of great concern.</P></TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD align=left colSpan=3>Studies in Canada have shown that average 
            intakes are generally higher in the Baffin Inuit population as a 
            result of a diet involving large amounts of marine mammals and fish, 
            while the Sahtu Dene/Metis peoples who consume mainly caribou and 
            fish have lower intakes. Baffin Inuit exhibit one-day intakes that 
            exceed tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) for Chlordane and Toxaphene by 
            nearly ten-fold. It is possible to gauge the relative, but not 
            absolute, risk by comparing estimated one-day intakes with currently 
            held tolerable daily intakes. Exceedance of TDIs is of particular 
            concern if an individual continues to exceed the limit for a 
            significant period of their life. Existing TDI guidelines need to be 
            improved for Arctic residents based upon studies of interactions 
            among individual contaminants present in Arctic foods, and between 
            contaminants and nutrients.

      <P><I>Corresponding levels of POPs are seen in human blood and breast milk 
      samples</I><BR>Due mainly to dietary factors, certain populations of Inuit 
      in Canada and Greenland seem to be particularly exposed to some POPs. 
      Because many POPs can pass the placental barrier, POP levels as measured 
      in the blood of pregnant women are reflected in their offspring. Mothers 
      can pass POPs to their newborn through breast milk. In some Canadian Inuit 
      women, breast milk concentrations of PCB and DDT are several times greater 
      than levels found in southern Canadian women. The effects of this exposure 
      to infants is not fully understood. 
      <P>Levels of POPs in Arctic indigenous peoples have been investigated in 
      an international pan-Arctic study conducted by AMAP.

      <P>From results obtained so far, highest levels of a number of POPs occur 
      in peoples living in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, and for DDT in 
      populations in nothern Russia, however there are gaps in the available 
      data for Alaska and much of Siberia. It is important to remember that the 
      social, and cultural well-being, and the physical health of many Arctic 
      indigenous peoples depends on the collection and consumption of 
      traditional (country) foods. In the majority of cases the benefits of 
      these traditional diets outweigh the disadvantages from associated with 
      contaminants - however, greater knowledge is required to allow appropriate 
      advice to be given to indigenous peoples on the security of their food. 
      <P><I>Advice concerning human exposure</I><BR>Several groups of people in 
      the Arctic are highly exposed to POPs derived from long-range transport or 
      local sources, which accumulate in animals that are used as traditional 
      foods. However, weighing the well-known benefits of breast milk and 
      traditional food against the suspected but not yet fully understood 
      effects of POPs, it is recommended that: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Consumption of traditional food continues, with recognition that 
        there is a need for dietary advice to Arctic peoples so they can make 
        informed choices concerning the foods they eat. 
        <LI>Breast feeding should continue to be promoted. </LI></UL>

      number of POPs decresed in the 1970s and the early-1980s following the 
      introduction of bans and restrictions, however concentrations do not 
      appear to have changed significantly over the last 15-20 years.
