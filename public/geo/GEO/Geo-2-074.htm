Florida Everglades </H2>An American natural treasure is in trouble. Once the 
Florida Everglades was a vibrant, free-flowing river of grass that provided 
clean water from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Today this extraordinary 
ecosystem- unlike any other in the world-is dying. 
<P>The Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996 provided the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers with the authority to review the current Central and Southern 
Florida Project. The Corps was asked to develop a comprehensive plan to restore 
and preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem while enhancing water supplies 
and maintaining flood protection. The resulting Central and Southern Florida 
Project Comprehensive Review Study-commonly called the Restudy-was led by the 
Jacksonville District of the Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water 
Management District, located in West Palm Beach, Florida. 
<P>The comprehensive plan and the current status of the project is available on 
the World Wide Web at: <A 
href="http://www.evergladesplan.org/">http://www.evergladesplan.org/ </B></A>or 
the Jacksonville District home page: www.saj.usace.army.mil.
