      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Landscapes such as those seen in 
      Yellowstone have long been shaped by fire and not just the cool, creeping 
      ground fires often described as "good" for grass production. The natural 
      history of fire in the park includes large-scale conflagrations sweeping 
      across the park’s vast volcanic plateaus, hot, wind-driven fires torching 
      up the trunks to the crowns of the pine and fir trees at several 
      hundred-year intervals.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Such wildfires occurred across much of the 
      ecosystem in the 1700s. But that, of course, was prior to the arrival of 
      European explorers, to the designation of the park, and the pattern 
      established by its early caretakers to battle all blazes in the belief 
      that fire suppression was good stewardship. Throughout much of the 20th 
      century, park managers and visitors alike have continued to view fire as a 
      destructive force, one to be mastered, or at least tempered to a tamer, 
      more controlled entity. By the 1940s, ecologists recognized that fire was 
      a primary agent of change in many ecosystems, including the arid 
      mountainous western United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, national parks 
      and forests began to experiment with controlled burns, and by the 1970s 
      Yellowstone and other parks had instituted a natural fire management plan 
      to allow the process of lightning-caused fire to continue influencing 
      wildland succession.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Many of Yellowstone’s plant species are 
      fire-adapted. Some (not all) of the lodgepole pines (<I>Pinus 
      contorta</I>), which make up nearly 80% of the park’s extensive forests, 
      have cones that are serotinous sealed by resin until the intense heat of 
      fire cracks the bonds and releases the seeds inside. Fires may stimulate 
      regeneration of sagebrush, aspen, and willows, but the interactions 
      between these plants and fire is complicated by other influences such as 
      grazing levels and climate. Though above-ground parts of grasses and forbs 
      are consumed by flames, the below-ground root systems typically remain 
      unharmed, and for a few years after fire these plants commonly increase in 
      productivity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the first sixteen years of 
      Yellowstone’s natural fire policy (1972-1987), 235 fires were allowed to 
      burn 33,759 acres. Only 15 of those fires were larger than 100 acres, and 
      all of the fires were extinguished naturally. Public response to the fires 
      was good, and the program was considered a success. The summers of 
      1982-1987 were wetter than average, which may have contributed to the 
      relatively low fire activity in those years.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">No one anticipated that 1988 would be 
      radically different. In April and May, Yellowstone received higher-than 
      normal rainfall. But by June, the greater Yellowstone area was 
      experiencing a severe drought. Forest fuels grew progressively drier, and 
      the early summer thunderstorms produced lightning without rain. The fire 
      season began, but still without hint of the record season to come. Eleven 
      of 20 early-season fires went out by themselves, and the rest were being 
      monitored in accordance with the existing fire management plan.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The summer of 1988 turned out to be the 
      driest in the park’s recorded history. By July 15, only 8,500 acres had 
      burned in the entire greater Yellowstone area. Still, due to continued dry 
      conditions, on July 21 by which time fire activity had become noticeable 
      to park visitors and to the national media the decision was made to 
      suppress all fires. But within a week, fires within the park alone 
      encompassed more nearly 99,000 acres, and by the end of the month, dry 
      fuels and high winds combined to make the larger fires nearly 
      uncontrollable. National news reporters poured into Yellowstone National 
      Park, as did firefighters from around the country, bolstered by military 
      recruits. On the worst single day, August 20, 1988, tremendous winds 
      pushed fire across more than 150,000 acres. Throughout August and early 
      September, some park roads and facilities were closed to the public, and 
      residents of nearby towns outside the park feared for their property and 
      their lives. Yellowstone’s fire management policy was the topic of heated 
      debate, from the restaurants of park border towns to the halls of 
      Congress.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">By September 11, 1988, the first snows of 
      autumn had dampened the fires as the nation’s largest fire-fighting effort 
      could not. The imminent danger to life and property was over, and 
      firefighters were gradually sent home, although the last of the smoldering 
      flames were not extinguished until November. Staff in Yellowstone National 
      Park went to work surveying the impacts of the fires on wildlife, plants, 
      historic structures, trails, and more and answering the demands for 
      information, explanation, and a new fire management policy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">A total of 248 fires started in greater 
      Yellowstone in 1988; 50 of those were in Yellowstone National Park. 
      Despite widespread misconceptions that all fires were initially allowed to 
      burn, only 31 of the total were; 28 of these began inside the park. In the 
      end, 7 major fires were responsible for more than 95% of the burned 
      acreage. Five of those fires were ignited outside the park, and 3 of them 
      were human-caused fires that firefighters attempted to control from the 
      beginning. More than 25,000 firefighters, as many as 9000 at one time, 
      attacked Yellowstone fires in 1988, at a total cost of about $120 million. 
      Thankfully, the fires killed no park visitors and no nearby residents. 
      Outside the park, two firefighters were killed, one by a falling tree and 
      one while piloting a plane transporting other personnel.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Ecosystemwide, about 1.2 million acres was 
      scorched; 793,000 (about 36%) of the park’s 2,221,800 acres were burned. 
      Sixty-seven structures were destroyed, including 18 cabins used by 
      employees and guests and one backcountry patrol cabin in Yellowstone. 
      Estimated property damage totaled more than $3 million. About 665 miles of 
      hand-cut fireline and 137 miles of bulldozer lines, including 32 miles in 
      the park, needed some rehabilitation, along with the remnants of fire 
      camps and helicopter-landing spots. Surveys found that 345 dead elk (of an 
      estimated 40,000-50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison 
      died in greater Yellowstone as a direct result of the fires; 2 
      radio-collared grizzly bears were missing and were presumed to have been 
      killed, (although one turned up alive and well several years later). Most 
      of the animals that died were trapped as fire quickly swept down two 
      drainages, and were discovered when biologists subsequently observed 
      scavenging grizzlies, coyotes, and birds feeding on the carcasses. A few 
      small fish-kills occurred as a result of either heated water or dropping 
      fire retardant on the streams. Surveys revealed that less than 1% of soils 
      were heated enough to burn below-ground plant seeds and roots.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">A massive effort was funded by the U.S. 
      Congress to restore damaged facilities and to study the long-term 
      ecological, social, and economic effects of the Yellowstone fires. 
      Although the tourist season was cut prematurely short by the fires and 
      associated firefighting activity, the feared abandonment of regional 
      visitors failed to materialize in 1989. The effects on many plants and 
      animals are still being studied, although in the short-term, most wildlife 
      populations showed no effect or rebounded quickly from the fiery summer. 
      In the several years following 1988, ample precipitation combined with the 
      short-term effects of ash and nutrient influx to make for spectacular 
      displays of wildflowers in burned areas. And, where serotinous lodgepole 
      pines were burned, seed densities ranged from 50,000 to 1 million per 
      acre, beginning a new cycle of forest growth under the blackened canopy 
      above.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Across the nation, national parks and 
      forests suspended and updated their fire management plans, assisted by the 
      ecological assessment of a panel of independent scientists and by revised 
      national fire management policies. In 1992, Yellowstone National Park 
      again had a wildland fire management plan, but with stricter guidelines 
      under which naturally occurring fires may be allowed to burn.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Although unprecedented in the 125-year 
      history of the park, the scientists reviewing the effects of the 1988 
      fires reminded us that fires of such scale burned elsewhere in similar 
      ecosystems during this century, and earlier in the landscape’s 
      history.</FONT> 
      <DIR>
      <P><I><FONT face="Times New Roman">Only a miniscule portion of once vast 
      wilderness landscapes has been preserved, and the boundaries and spatial 
      extent of these preserved bear little relationship to the natural 
      processes necessary for their preservation. The 1988 fires have laid bare 
      the broad extent of our ignorance of those natural processes.</FONT></I>

      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Through continued public education, 
      scientific research, and professional fire management, Yellowstone hopes 
      to preserve the process of natural fire in the park while minimizing 
      adverse effects on park visitors and neighbors, recognizing the 
      inevitability of this force to continue shaping the landscape as it has 
      for centuries.</FONT></P>
