<H2>Revised Inventory Results</H2>
<P>This bulletin presents revised summary results from the 1997 National 
Resources Inventory (NRI). The NRI is conducted by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, in cooperation with the 
Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory.</P>
<P>This bulletin has been reissued because in March 2000 an error was discovered 
in the 1997 NRI results originally issued in December 1999. The error was in the 
statistical software used by the Statistical Laboratory to calculate estimates 
for the inventory. Re-release of the inventory results was delayed until 
December 2000 in order to conduct a complete quality assurance review of all 
phases of the inventory, to institute a number of additional quality checks, and 
to include wetlands data in the final release.</P>
<P>The most noticeable difference between the data released in December 1999 and 
the corrected estimates issued in December 2000 is in the estimated increase in 
developed lands. The corrected data show an increase of 11.2 million acres 
during the period 1992 to 1997; this figure is 30% lower than the December 1999 
estimate. The corrected estimate of total developed land for 1997 is 98.3 
million acres, which is 7.1 million acres lower than the December 1999 estimate. 
This means the revised figures show an additional 7.1 million acres of rural 
land for 1997 and, subsequently, more acres of cropland, rangeland, and forest 
land than were reported in December 1999.</P>
<P>The computer programming error occurred in a portion of the statistical 
estimation procedure that assigns weights to sample points. These weights are 
based on sampling (selection) probabilities, estimates from previous NRIs, and 
known land base attributes from the Census Bureau and other sources. Because of 
the programming error, incorrect weights were assigned to some sample points. 
Sample points that changed into developed land were affected in a systematic 
manner (not randomly), so that the corrections lowered all estimates of 1997 
developed land.</P><A name=introduction></A>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>This bulletin includes state and national level estimates for changes in 
broad land cover/use, cropland use by irrigated and nonirrigated acres, broad 
land cover/use by land capability class and subclass, prime farmland, erosion 
and erodibility, wildlife habitat diversity, and wetlands and deepwater 
habitats. These basic summary statistics are presented via the Internet and in 
hard copy to provide base-line natural resource information to a variety of 
groups and individuals interested in obtaining insight into the condition of our 
Nation's nonfederal rural lands. Subsequent sections of this bulletin discuss 
the broader suite of information available from the 1997 NRI and methods for 
obtaining access to other results. </P>
<P>The NRI is a scientifically based, longitudinal panel survey of the Nation’s 
soil, water, and related resources, designed to assess conditions and trends 
every five years. The 1997 NRI provides results that are nationally consistent 
for all nonfederal lands for four points in time <FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> 
1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997.</P><A name=background></A>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>The Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation 
Service, was established in response to the Dust Bowl catastrophe of the 
mid-1930’s. Hugh Hammond Bennett, the agency founder and first administrator, 
convinced the U. S. Congress that soil erosion was a national menace and that a 
permanent agency within the Department of Agriculture was needed to call 
landowners’ attention to their land stewardship opportunities and 
responsibilities. The results of the 1934 National Erosion Reconnaissance 
Survey, which was the first formal study of erosion conducted in the United 
States, were instrumental in the passage of the Soil Conservation Act of 1935. 
Through the Act, the Soil Conservation Service was established, and a nationwide 
partnership of federal agencies, local conservation districts, and communities 
was developed to provide assistance to the rural and urban sectors in the 
conservation of natural resources. Today, more than 60 years later, NRCS 
champions the vitality of the land as USDA’s lead conservation agency. No other 
federal agency speaks for the health of America’s private land.</P>
<P>Throughout its history, NRCS has conducted periodic inventories of the 
Nation’s natural resources. The 1945 Soil and Water Conservation Needs Inventory 
(CNI), a reconnaissance study, was the foundation for the 1958 and 1967 CNI’s, 
the agency’s first efforts to collect data nationally for scientifically 
selected field sites. The 1975 Potential Cropland Study examined the conversion 
of the Nation’s best farmland to urban development. National Resources 
Inventories were conducted in 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. Several less 
intensive, special-issue inventories have been performed during the 1990’s to 
investigate topical matters of concern and to supplement recent NRIs.</P>
<P>In addition to these recurrent NRI inventories, NRCS also collects large 
quantities of field level natural resources data in support of conservation 
planning activities and the Soil Survey Program. Thousands of NRCS technical 
specialists, including soil scientists, soil conservationists, range 
conservationists, foresters, wildlife biologists, and agronomists, collect data 
at the field and farm level in order to provide conservation assistance to 
farmers and ranchers in the development of conservation systems uniquely 
tailored to the land and their individual way of doing business. Assistance is 
also provided to rural and urban communities to help reduce erosion, conserve 
and protect water resources, and solve other resource-related problems. The 
information that NRCS collects about natural resources in the United States is 
critical for sustaining agriculture, promoting the conservation and stewardship 
ethic, and preserving the health of the Nation's natural resources and 
environment.</P>
<P>Legislation also has mandated that NRCS collect natural resources data. The 
Rural Development Act of 1972 was a key statute in authorizing resource 
inventory activities within NRCS. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to 
implement a land inventory and monitoring program and to issue a report on the 
conditions and trends of soil, water, and related resources at intervals not 
exceeding 5 years. The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 and 
other supporting legislation augmented the statutory mandate for periodic 
assessment of the Nation’s natural resources. To fulfill this requirement, the 
NRI was developed to provide critical information regarding natural resources 
and to supplement the NRCS Soil Survey Program. </P><A name=procedure></A>
<H2>Inventory Procedure</H2>
<P>The objectives of NRCS resource inventories have expanded over time, as the 
focus of agricultural policy has moved toward a balance between short-term 
production goals, long-term capabilities, and environmental quality. Statistical 
techniques, data collection protocols, and data handling and dissemination 
technologies have evolved as inventory goals have become broader and more 
sophisticated. </P>
<P>The primary objective of the 1997 NRI was to provide natural resource 
managers, policy makers, and the public with scientifically valid, timely, and 
relevant information on natural resources and the environment. This information 
can provide the scientific basis for effective public policies, sound 
agricultural and natural resource legislation, sensible state and national 
conservation programs, and targeted USDA financial and technical assistance in 
addressing natural resource concerns. NRI data are designed to be part of the 
core components of the agency's strategic planning and accountability efforts, 
and to help assess consequences of existing legislative mandates, such as the 
1996 Farm Bill.</P>
<P>To accomplish these objectives in a cost-effective manner, it was necessary 
to conduct the 1997 NRI in much the same manner as the 1992 NRI. Careful 
consideration was given to assure that 1997 NRI data elements were consistent 
with definitions, categories, and concepts from previous inventories. The same 
sample used for the 1992 NRI was used for 1997 data collection. This enables 
analysis of trends extending over 15 years (1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997).</P>
<P>NRI data are collected at scientifically selected sample sites. The sample 
constitutes a two-stage stratified area sample of the entire country. Samples 
are located in all counties and parishes of the 50 states and in Puerto Rico, 
the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, and selected portions of the 
Pacific Basin. The first-stage sampling unit, or primary sampling unit (PSU), is 
an area/segment of land; the second-stage sampling units are points located 
within the PSUs. Detailed NRI data are collected for the specific sample points, 
but some items are also collected for the entire PSU/segment. Some data, such as 
total surface area, federally owned land, and area in large water bodies, are 
collected on a census basis external to the sample survey. The NRI database 
accounts for and represents the total area of the United States, but very little 
information is given for points on federal lands. </P>
<P>Data for the 1997 NRI were collected for about 300,000 PSUs and 800,000 
sample points, using photo-interpretation and other remote sensing methods and 
standards. Data gatherers utilized a variety of ancillary materials; extensive 
use was made of USDA field office records, information provided by local NRCS 
field personnel, soil survey and wetland inventory maps and reports, and tables 
and technical guides developed by local field office staffs. The NRI is unique 
because of established linkages to the NRCS Soil Survey Program. NRCS expertise 
in identifying soil occurrences and patterns, and utilizing this knowledge to 
provide technical assistance in the development of conservation plans for 
landowners is a primary agency function. The NRI data gathering process relies 
heavily upon information contained in the Soil Survey Database. Information 
about specific properties and characteristics of the soil and surrounding 
landscapes is utilized to develop NRI data elements and interpretations. NRI 
data is a primary source of information for evaluating the success of NRCS soil 
conservation programs in reducing soil erosion.</P>
<P>Inventory procedures were developed to ensure that data reflect 1997 growing 
season conditions, that inventory results are nationally consistent, and that 
data recorded for the years 1982, 1987, and 1992 are consistent with the 1997 
determination. Intricate quality assurance procedures were developed to make 
sure that year-to-year differences reflect actual changes in resource 
conditions, rather than differences in the perspectives of two different data 
collection specialists or changes in technologies and protocols.</P>
<P>Data gathering for the 1997 NRI occurred from July 1997 through October 1998. 
This time frame took into account that some aerial photography needed to be 
flown during a time period that highlighted late growing season conditions. 
Consequently, delivery of imagery to some data collection sites did not occur 
until later in the data collection cycle.</P>
<P>Field visits were not required for the 1997 NRI unless available imagery and 
ancillary materials were not suitable for making determinations for one or more 
data elements. Field visits were also made for training purposes and other 
facets of the quality assurance process. All NRI sample sites were visited 
on-site for the 1982 NRI. Subsequent on-site visits of selected PSUs also 
occurred in 1987, 1991, 1992, or 1995.</P>
<P>The computer-assisted survey information collection methods developed for the 
1997 NRI provided substantial efficiencies in data gathering and data processing 
and were important facets of the quality assurance process. The system featured 
direct entry of data into hand-held computers called personal digital assistants 
(PDAs), modern information technology, a national database server at the Iowa 
State University Statistical Laboratory, and elaborate data checking protocols 
that featured review and edit of data recorded during previous inventories.</P>
<P>Standards and protocols for the NRI were developed nationally by NRCS, in 
collaboration with the Statistical Laboratory. Oversight and management of 
data-gathering activities were assigned to 21 units established during 1996 and 
1997. These units, called Inventory Collection and Coordination Sites (ICCS’s) 
were established according to regional land use patterns and according to state 
allocations of resources. Geographic boundaries of ICCS organizations ranged 
from one state to all or portions of several states. Some ICCS’s distributed 
data collection staff among multiple office locations, while others assembled 
staff at one central location.</P>
<P>Inventory methodology is evolving as part of an ongoing effort to better 
assess soil conservation, natural resource health, and other agri-environmental 
issues. The NRI has been conducted as a longitudinal survey designed to assess 
condition and trends of nonfederal lands every 5 years. Current initiatives 
include transitioning to a continuous resource inventory process, developing a 
multi-agency integrated inventory approach, incorporating a wider variety of 
assessment tools for resource health, and further development of geospatial 
analysis and modeling capabilities to support policy analysis and program 
implementation.</P><A name=utilization></A>
<H2>Utilization and Interpretation of NRI Data</H2>
<H3>Uses of the Data</H3>
<P>The NRI database contains millions of pieces of information. It can serve as 
the foundation for inspection and analysis of the condition of our Nation’s 
natural resources. It indicates </P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> how our Nation’s nonfederal lands are being 
used;</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> the condition of our natural resources;</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> how land use patterns have changed over time. </P>
<P>The NRI database has been constructed in a manner that facilitates the 
inspection and analysis of these data. Sophisticated statistical procedures 
developed collaboratively with Iowa State University have been used to provide a 
database that scientifically incorporates a broad array of data into a format 
that is easy to use and manipulate. Appendix 1 presents an overview of 
statistical considerations and provides references that contain further details. 
</P>
<P>The 1997 NRI database contains data for four points in time (1982, 1987, 
1992, and 1997) that are comparable and consistent, and that reflect true 
trends. Reliable and accurate temporal analysis is available from this data set. 
Analytical capabilities are greatly enhanced because NRCS’s extensive soil 
interpretations database is an integral and easy-to-use part of the NRI 
database.</P>
<P>The NRI is conducted to obtain scientifically valid, timely, and relevant 
data on natural resources and environmental conditions, with the specific goal 
of supporting agricultural and environmental policy development and program 
implementation. Historically, NRI information has been used to formulate 
effective public policies, to fashion agricultural and natural resources 
legislation, to develop state and national conservation programs, to allocate 
USDA financial and technical assistance in addressing natural resource concerns, 
and to enhance the public’s understanding of natural resources and environmental 
issues. Information derived from the NRI is used by natural resource managers; 
policy makers and analysts; consultants; the media; other federal agencies; 
state governments; universities; environmental, commodity, and farm groups; and 
the public. </P>
<H3>Interpretation of the Data</H3>
<P>Statistics derived from the NRI database are estimates and not absolutes. 
This means that there is some amount of uncertainty in any result obtained using 
NRI data. Statistical reliability guidelines are discussed in Appendix 1.</P>
<P>The NRI database contains linkages to other databases, in particular to the 
agency’s extensive soil interpretations database. Linkages can be made to other 
databases by using other themes, such as cover/use, forest cover type, and 
spatial features. Analysis of NRI data in conjunction with other data sources is 
encouraged; nonetheless, differences in definitions, concepts, and data 
collection protocols should be carefully examined. It is worth repeating that 
the NRI includes very little data for federal lands. </P>
<P>The 1997 NRI database has been designed for use in detecting significant 
changes in resource conditions relative to the years 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. 
All comparisons for two points in time should be made using the new 1997 NRI 
database. Comparisons made using data published for the 1982, 1987, or 1992 NRI 
may produce erroneous results, because of changes in statistical estimation 
protocols, and because all data collected prior to 1997 were simultaneously 
reviewed (edited) as 1997 NRI data were collected. Note, for example, that 
federal land area for 1992 has been adjusted from 408 to 402 million acres, and 
that the estimate of 1992 nonfederal rangeland has changed from 399 to 407 
million acres.</P>
<P>The NRI provides not only overall estimates of change in resource conditions 
but also the dynamics of the changes. For example, it is typically more 
informative to examine gross losses and gains in cropland (rather than just the 
net change from one year to another) and further to determine why cropland was 
lost (e.g., to urban development), how much had been prime farmland, and "where" 
these losses are occurring. If new cropland is gained, the question is whether 
this will cause additional conservation and environmental concerns because the 
new cropland is more erodible, or the soils are less productive and require 
higher levels of fertilization, or the land is sited in some other sensitive 
location.</P>
<P>The erosion data cannot be used to compute the actual erosion occurring 
during a particular year. Erosion rates are estimated average annual (or 
expected) rates based upon the cropping practices, management practices, and 
inherent resource conditions that occur at each NRI sample site. Climatic 
factors used in the erosion prediction equations (models) are based upon 
long-term average conditions and not upon one year’s actual events. Note also 
that NRI estimates of sheet and rill erosion are based upon the standard 
Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and not the revised USLE (RUSLE), and that 
erosion estimates are made only for cropland, CRP land, and pastureland.</P>
<P>The NRI category of "developed land" varies from that used by some other data 
collection entities. For the NRI, the intent is to identify which lands have 
been permanently removed from the rural land base. Therefore, the developed land 
category includes: (a) large tracts of urban and built-up land; (b) small tracts 
of built-up land, less than 10 acres in size; and (c) land outside of these 
built-up areas that is in roads, railroads, and associated rights-of-way.</P>
<P>The 1997 NRI shows only minor changes in land under Conservation Reserve 
Program (CRP) contracts for the time period 1992 to 1997, even though most 
original CRP contracts expired in the mid-1990’s and there were extensive 
sign-ups during that period. This is because the 1997 NRI reflects conditions as 
of the 1997 growing season, and most actual on-the-ground changes in CRP land 
did not occur until later in 1997 or until the 1998 growing season.</P>
<P>For the NRI, land is considered irrigated if irrigation occurs during the 
year of inventory, or for two or more of the last four years. Other entities 
typically consider land to be irrigated only if irrigation water is applied for 
the year of interest.</P>
<P>NRI classification of wetlands is slightly different than that used by the 
Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS) in their statistically based Wetlands Status 
and Trends study. The NRI and the FWS inventory have different legislative 
mandates; sampling methodology, inventory protocols, data handling, and analysis 
routines have evolved independently over the past two decades. Recent 
collaborative efforts have resulted in enhanced classifications for both 
programs, but wetlands data collected by the two agencies are currently neither 
comparable nor interchangeable. The NRI multi-resource approach is quite 
beneficial to USDA analysts and others who examine conservation and 
agri-environmental issues. Results from the FWS study are quite beneficial to 
the Department of Interior and others.</P>
<P>The NRI has been designed to facilitate geospatial analysis. This not only 
enhances the analysis process, but also makes it possible to use a map to 
present analytical findings. Maps produced from NRI data depict only patterns or 
trends within an area and do not provide an estimate of conditions for any 
specific location on the map. </P>
<H3>Availability</H3>
<P>This report presents selected NRI summary data at the national level. Further 
information regarding the NRI and additional data summaries can be obtained from 
the national NRI Internet site at: </P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.nhq.nrcs.usda.gov/NRI/">http://www.nhq.nrcs.usda.gov/NRI/</A>.</P>
<P>Additional data summaries from the NRI will be released periodically as more 
comprehensive analyses are performed. Of particular interest are detailed 
compilations of data at the state level, which can be accessed via this Internet 
site. Active links to individual state Internet sites are available for 
obtaining specific state-level NRI information.</P><A name=explanation></A>
<H2>Explanation of the Tables</H2>
<P>On the following pages selected national summary data are displayed in 19 
tables. Definitions of terms are the same as for the 1992 NRI (see Appendix 3 – 
Glossary of Selected Terms). National totals include results for the 48 
contiguous states, Hawaii, and the Caribbean area. Results for Alaska and the 
Pacific Basin islands of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan will be released at a 
later date.</P>
<P>The category "other rural land," which occurs in many of the tables, includes 
farmsteads and other farm structures, field windbreaks, barren land such as salt 
flats or exposed rock, and marshland.</P>
<P>The figures used in the tables are estimates, not absolutes. They are based 
on data collected at sample sites, not data taken from a complete census. 
Therefore, sampling variation is present but generally small for state and 
national totals. However, sampling variation may be significant when using these 
totals to calculate 5- and 10-year changes. Small changes may not be 
statistically significant.</P>
<P>Table 1 presents NRI findings on surface area, federal land, nonfederal rural 
land, developed land, and water area. Since 1982, federal land increased by 2.7 
million acres, nonfederal rural land decreased by 28.9 million acres, and 
developed land increased by 25.0 million acres. Developed land totaled 98.3 
million acres in 1997 (fig. 1).</P>
<P>Tables 2 and 3 present estimates of acreage of land cover/use for six 
components of nonfederal rural land (cropland, CRP land, pastureland, rangeland, 
forest land, and other rural land). Cropland is classified as irrigated, 
nonirrigated, cultivated, or noncultivated acreage. Cropland acreage nationally 
decreased by 44.0 million acres between 1982 and 1997. Rangeland decreased by 
10.8 million acres and pastureland decreased by 12.0 million acres. Table 3 
further reveals a shift in irrigated agriculture from west to east across the 
country.</P>
<P>Table 4 presents acres of land cover/use by land capability class and 
subclass. The land capability classification system was originally developed by 
the Soil Conservation Service and provides a quick, uniform, and useful way to 
evaluate the potential of land for crop production. Each capability class has 
several subclasses to identify specific limitations on use: </P>
<P>e = erosion risk, </P>
<P>w = wetness, </P>
<P>s = shallowness or root zone problems, and </P>
<P>c = climatic limitations. </P>
<P>Class I soils have few limitations that restrict their use. Class II soils 
have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require 
careful management. Land identified as Class IIe, for example, would be suitable 
for growing crops if adequate measures were installed to reduce or prevent soil 
erosion.</P>
<P>Class III soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants, 
require special conservation practices, or both. Class IV soils have very severe 
limitations that reduce the choice of plants, require very careful management, 
or both. </P>
<P>Class V soils are not likely to erode but have other limitations, impractical 
to remove, that limit their use largely to pasture or range, woodland or 
wildlife. Class VI soils have severe limitations that make them generally 
unsuitable for cultivation and limit their use largely to pasture, range, 
woodland, or wildlife. Class VII soils have very severe limitations that make 
them generally unsuitable for cultivation and limit their use largely to 
pasture, range, woodland, or wildlife. Class VIII soils and miscellaneous land 
types have limitations that preclude their use for commercial crop production 
and restrict their use for recreation, wildlife, water supply, or esthetic 
purposes.</P>
<P>Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8 provide an overview of land use changes from 1982<FONT 
face=Symbol>-</FONT> 97, 1982<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> 87, 1987<FONT 
face=Symbol>-</FONT> 92, and 1992<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> 97. These tables 
show all land conversions, whereas previous tables presented net land use 
change. For example, table 5 shows that a total of 70.7 million acres of 1982 
cropland was converted to other uses by 1997, which was offset by 26.7 million 
acres converted to cropland from non-cropland uses since 1982. The net change 
was therefore a reduction of 44.0 million acres of cropland, as shown in table 
2. Table 5 further shows that, of the 70.7 million acres of cropland converted 
to other uses, 30.4 million acres went to CRP, 19.3 million acres went to 
pastureland, 3.7 million acres went to rangeland, 5.6 million acres went to 
forest land, 3.2 million acres went to other rural land, 7.1 million acres went 
to developed land, and 1.5 million acres went to water areas and federal land. 
Of the 26.7 million acres converted to cropland from other uses, 15.3 million 
acres came from pastureland, 7.0 million acres came from rangeland, 2.0 million 
acres came from forest land, 1.4 million acres came from other rural land, 0.2 
million acres came from developed land, and 0.8 million acres came from water 
areas and federal land.</P>
<P>Table 9 presents the distribution of prime farmland by land cover/use. Prime 
farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical 
characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and 
is also available for these uses. There were 331.9 million acres of prime 
farmland in 1997, which was down 10.0 million acres from 1982. Most (64%) of the 
prime farmland is in cropland, but large amounts are in pastureland (35.5 
million acres) and forest land (48.7 million acres).</P>
<P>Tables 10 and 11 present estimates from the NRI for soil erosion rates. Table 
10 shows rates of sheet and rill erosion, which is erosion caused by water; 
table 11 presents estimates of wind erosion. Average erosion rates for 1997 are 
substantially lower than erosion rates for 1982. The average rate of sheet and 
rill erosion fell from 4.0 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 2.8 tons per acre 
per year in 1997. The average rate of wind erosion on the same land base fell 
from 3.3 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 2.2 tons per acre per year in 1997. 
The combined wind and water erosion reduction translates to a savings of more 
than 1.2 billion tons of soil per year on cropland (fig. 2).</P>
<P>Tables 12 and 13 present acres of cropland (cultivated and noncultivated), 
pastureland, and CRP land with erosion rates greater than T, the soil loss 
tolerance or rate at which soil productivity is maintained.</P>
<P>Table 14 shows acreage according to six classes of erodibility index scores. 
The erodibility index (EI) provides a numerical expression of the potential for 
a soil to erode, considering the physical and chemical properties of the soil 
and climatic conditions where it is located. The higher the index, the greater 
the investment needed to maintain the sustainability of the soil resource base 
if intensively cropped. EI scores above 8 are equated to highly erodible 
land.</P>
<P>Table 15 presents statistical information dealing with wildlife habitat 
composition and configuration. Median diameter of habitat patch size is an 
indicator of habitat diversity. For the 1997 NRI, general cover data were 
collected along X-shaped transects (the length of each diagonal line of the 
transect was 1,000 feet). Patches of cover were classified to one of nine 
general cover types (see Appendix 3, glossary). Entries in Table 15 denoted as 
"&gt; 1,000" indicate that at least 50% of the transects were classified as 
having a 1,000 foot length of the same cover type.</P>
<P>Tables 16, 17, 18, and 19 present estimates of status and changes in wetland 
and deepwater habitat acreage; classification of these systems is according to 
the Cowardin et al. (1979) classification system. Table 16 shows an estimate of 
111.2 million acres of Palustrine and Estuarine wetlands on water areas and 
nonfederal land for 1997, as well as an additional 47.8 million acres of other 
aquatic habitats. Table 17 presents the distribution of Palustrine and Estuarine 
wetlands by land cover/use; most (59%) of these acres are on forest land. Table 
18 shows 506.0 thousand acres of Palustrine and Estuarine wetlands were 
converted to uplands between 1992 and 1997, and 343.2 acres of uplands were 
converted to Palustrine and Estuarine wetlands during this time period (fig. 3). 
These conversion estimates show an average annual gross loss of 101.2 thousand 
acres, an average annual gross gain of 68.6 thousand acres, and an average 
annual net loss of 32.6 thousand acres per year. These figures do not take into 
account any losses or gains occurring on federal land. Table 19 presents more 
particulars regarding the losses and gains. Development accounts for 49% of the 
losses; agriculture accounts for 26 % of the losses (fig. 4). Natural variations 
in climatic cycles and hydrology are responsible for the majority of wetland 
losses captured in the "miscellaneous causes" category. Estimates dealing with 
losses and gains are presented nationally and by region, but not by state; 
almost all state numbers are smaller (in absolute value) than their margins of 
error and, therefore, not significantly different (statistically) than zero. 
Estimated margins of error (or 95% confidence intervals) are presented in table 
19 to assist the reader in determining which regional estimates are 
statistically significant. Margins or error and statistical reliability are 
discussed in Appendix 1.</P><A name=metric></A>
