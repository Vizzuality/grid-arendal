            are the product of millennia of evolution—ecosystems of diverse 
            complexes of plants, animals, soil, water and air. While they host 
            the same basic life forms as forests throughout the world, Canada's 
            forests bring together species and ecosystems distinct to our 
            country. The life these forests support has an intrinsic value that 
            underpins its social, cultural and economic importance.</FONT></B>

            hspace=10 src="Geo-2-409_files/p6c.gif" vspace=10 width=300> With 
            10% of the world's temperate and boreal forests (an estimated 30% of 
            the world's boreal forest), Canada is one of the few developed 
            nations still richly endowed with large areas of natural forest. The 
            total area of Canada is 927 million hectares, of which 921.5 million 
            hectares is land. About half of the land mass (417.6 million 
            hectares ) is covered by forest and of this, approximately 57% 
            (234.5 million hectares) is considered commercial forest, capable of 
            producing timber along with a variety of other benefits, including 
            maple products, Christmas trees and specialty craft products. Not 
            all of this commercial forest, however, is currently accessible and 
            managed for timber production. Of the total Canadian land area south 
            of the northern tree line (approximately 45° latitude), well over 80 
            percent is forested. 
            <P><IMG align=right alt="CANADA'S FOREST TYPES" border=0 height=131 
            hspace=10 src="Geo-2-409_files/p6b.gif" vspace=10 width=300> The 
            fifteen terrestrial ecozones of Canada (based largely on climate and 
            landform variations) have been broken down into 194 different 
            ecoregions, which in turn have been subdivided into 1 020 
            ecodistricts. Eleven of the ecozones have 15% or more forest cover, 
            with distinct mixes and numbers of species. 
            <P>Forests are home to roughly two thirds of the 140 000 species of 
            plants, animals and microorganisms (excluding viruses) estimated to 
            occur in Canada, only half of which have been described by 
            taxonomists. There are approximately 180 indigenous tree species in 
            Canada, of which 100 can be found in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone. 
            <P>The average age of Canada's forests increases from east to west, 
            reflecting differences in disturbance frequencies (fire, insect 
            outbreaks, timber harvesting) and natural variations in species 
            longevity. Tree species living past 160 years are common only in the 
            west and, as a result of natural forest succession, there is a 
            general shift from hardwood to softwood dominance with increasing 
            age of forest stands. 
            <P><IMG align=right alt="FOREST LAND OWNERSHIP" border=0 height=146 
            hspace=10 src="Geo-2-409_files/p7.gif" vspace=10 width=304> Under 
            the Canadian Constitution, the provinces have responsibility for 
            forest management. Most of Canada's forests (94%) are publicly 
            owned; provincial governments are responsible for managing 71% and 
            the federal and territorial governments manage 23%. The remaining 6% 
            are the private property of more than 425 000 landowners, including 
            individuals, families, corporations and communities. Fully 80% of 
            privately owned forest land is located east of Manitoba, most of it 
            in the Maritime provinces. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=#686844 
              face="Akzidenz Grotesk BE Md"><B>Reports on Canada's forests are 
              derived from Canada's Forest Inventory 1991 (revised in 1994). The 
              inventory is a spatially referenced database containing the best 
              information available in 1991. Forest management agencies have 
              recently begun to broaden the scope of forest inventories to 
              encompass non-timber values.</B></FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>In recognition 
            of the broad spectrum of forest users, provincial government 
            agencies seek public views and work closely with forest industries, 
            Aboriginal groups and environmental organizations to incorporate 
            recreational, social, wildlife and economic values into forest 
            management planning and decision making. Each province has its own 
            legislation, regulations, standards and programs through which it 
            allocates public forest harvesting rights and corresponding 
            management responsibilities. In the Northwest Territories and the 
            Nunavut Territory, the responsibility for resource management, 
            including that of forests, has been transferred from the federal 
            government to the territorial governments. A similar transfer is 
            being negotiated with the Yukon Territory. 
            <P>Annually, Canada harvests roughly 0.4% of its productive forest 
            area, an equivalent of approximately 73% of the annual allowable cut 
            <I>(see <A 
            href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/cfs/proj/ppiab/sof/sof00/trend1.shtml">Profiles 
            Across the Nation</A>),</I> while fire or insect outbreaks annually 
            affect approximately 0.5% of our forests. As a result of these major 
            disturbances, most of Canada's forests grow in even-aged stands. 
            <P>Some of Canada's forests are protected from harvesting by 
            legislation and policies, for example, forests located on sensitive 
            sites, such as those close to streams or on steep slopes. Other 
            forests are protected by legislation as part of Canada's commitment 
            to preserve a network of areas that are representative of our land 
            and fresh water. In 1995, approximately 7.6% (roughly 32 million 
            hectares) of Canada's forest land was protected by legislation, in 
            addition to the forests protected by provincial policies and 
            operational guidelines. Since that time, many provinces have 
            increased their number of protected areas. These additions have yet 
            to be integrated into national statistical databases.
