Security and Environment:<BR>Special Report: Dr Aslam Pervez Umrani &amp; Syed 
Munawar Ali Shah<BR>
<P>Food security can be defined as the state in which all persons obtain 
a<BR>nutritionally adequate, culturally acceptable diet at all times 
through<BR>local non-emergency sources. Food security broadens the traditional 
concepts<BR>of hunger, embracing a systemic view of the causes of hunger and 
poor<BR>nutrition within a community while identifying the changes necessary 
to<BR>prevent their occurrence. Food security programs confront hunger 
and<BR>poverty.<BR>In many cases, the environmental price of food production is 
the loss of<BR>natural vegetation and biological diversity, soil erosion, and 
surface and<BR>groundwater depletion. Inevitably, there are divergent views 
about how land<BR>should be used, whether for industrial crops, food, nature 
conservation or<BR>industry. These conflicts exist for coastal and inland areas 
and common<BR>property resources such as forests, grazing lands and even 
oceans.<BR>Clearly defined procedures are needed to satisfy different needs 
and<BR>interests in society, not only of current generations but also taking 
into<BR>account future needs. This means involving stakeholders, farmers, local 
land<BR>managers, non-governmental and governmental organisations, consumers 
and<BR>others, and evaluating the environmental costs of different land 
use<BR>options.<BR>Democratic structures and public opinion on environmental 
issues help to<BR>identify preferences and set appropriate land use goals, 
including the need<BR>for access to food, and an adequate diet for a healthy, 
active life.<BR>Transformation of current and future food production systems 
requires a land<BR>or resource-use planning approach and the formulation of 
explicit goals for<BR>alternative land uses. Planning is also necessary to 
define incentives for<BR>sustainable use, and to promote changes of attitude and 
values toward<BR>improved land use options. Today's severe pressure on marine 
fish stocks is<BR>an example of how misguided policy and lack of planning can 
lead to<BR>indiscriminate use of a common natural resource. Particularly in 
Sindh,<BR>Pakistan, political and bureaucratic sharks have engulfed the 
marine<BR>resources of province on the name of so-called development.<BR>A 
consensus exists among non-governmental sector of the Pakistan that 
new<BR>approaches should be adopted for economic development with emphasis on 
food<BR>security, social development and environmental security. These 
approaches<BR>enable to reduce poverty and save the environment of Pakistan. 
Attainment of<BR>Sustainable-Development, however, calls for an urgent reversal 
of the<BR>current trends requiring:<BR>1. Sustainable increases in agricultural 
productivity.<BR>2. Harmonising population growth with the level of food 
production.<BR>3. Better stewardship of the environment.<BR>4. Better and 
equitable use of water.<BR>5. Utilisation of Science and Technology in the 
promotion of Food Security<BR>and Sustainable Development.<BR>6. Consciously 
integrating the environmental concerns into mainstream<BR>economic thinking and 
to reflect these concerns in the design and<BR>implementation of development 
programmes.<BR>7. Develop indicators for the evaluation of development programs 
and<BR>policies achieving agricultural, demographic and environmental 
transitions.<BR>Experience has shown that countries in which there is good 
governance<BR>reap the benefits through more stable and sustainable economic 
growth. This<BR>involves<BR>promoting dialogue with all interest groups and 
sharing decision-making<BR>authority and control over resource allocation to 
district and local levels.<BR>A more enlightened role of government also implies 
working side-by-side with<BR>NGOs, farmers' associations and the private sector. 
The marginalisation of<BR>women from decisions and resources also has numerous 
negative effects on<BR>food production. Government is in the best position to 
assist women in<BR>sensitising them to environmental concerns by promoting 
interventions that<BR>improve their access to education and training, energy 
resources, and<BR>credit. Government must undertake the complex and difficult 
tasks of land<BR>tenure reform, channelling investment towards rural areas and 
enacting<BR>supporting policies that reflect a national ethic of 
sustainable<BR>development, reflecting, in turn, their circumstances.<BR>Present 
definitions of economic viability primarily consider<BR>productivity and 
profitability. They do not take into account<BR>sustainability. Neither are the 
costs of harmful effects on the environment<BR>included in the System of 
National Accounts, which countries use to measure<BR>their net economic gains 
and losses. The loss of environmental goods and<BR>services is particularly 
detrimental to poorer countries, whose economies<BR>are more dependent on 
natural resources and are thus more vulnerable to<BR>their loss.<BR>Intensive 
effort is needed to strengthen and test methodologies for<BR>national 
environmental accounting. This includes pricing the costs of soil<BR>and water 
degradation, of depletion of plant nutrients, loss of forest cover<BR>and 
biological diversity, practices that are economically and<BR>environmentally 
unsustainable.<BR>The environmental costs of producing different crops (i.e. the 
potential<BR>pollution or resource degradation intensity) also needs to be 
calculated in<BR>order to understand the conditions required for successful 
production. For<BR>example, agricultural income has to be adjusted to allow for 
various kinds<BR>of environmental damage, such as soil erosion, acidity, 
salinity and loss of<BR>plant nutrients, that arise from food 
production.<BR>Sustainable food security: requirements for a new era:<BR>The 
understanding of food security has evolved over the years 
through<BR>increasingly integrated attention to the social, gender, 
environmental,<BR>technical and economic dimensions of the problem. The 
challenge for the<BR>future will be to develop a peaceful, stable political, 
social and economic<BR>environment for Sustainable-Development. Also full and 
equal participation<BR>of men and women are also important for obtaining a food 
security and<BR>sustainable 
development<BR>**********************************************************************<BR>
<P>Problems Associated with Pesticide Use &amp; Misuse<BR>By: Dr Mushtaq Hussain 
Jokhio<BR>**********************************************************************<BR>Pesticides 
are mainly used to control and eradicate disease vectors of<BR>desirable plant 
species, which in turn improve agricultural productivity. In<BR>today's world, 
particularly in developing countries, the use of pesticides<BR>have become so 
important that they are linked with improvement of human<BR>welfare (Otter et 
al., 1980). Because the losses of crops caused by pests<BR>are higher in 
developing countries, specifically under mono-cropping<BR>systems.<BR>Despite 
all the benefits of pesticides, there is world-wide concern<BR>about their use, 
because pesticides injure non-target organisms, such as<BR>human, livestock, 
wildlife, insects, birds, fish and plants. According to<BR>Monbray (1988) 
600,000 tonnes of pesticides are exported to developing<BR>countries. Studies 
have shown that less than 0.1% of applied pesticides<BR>actually reach the 
targeted pests and remaining 99.9% have potential to move<BR>into soil, water 
and in atmosphere (Young &amp; Weigniann, 1988). Therefore it<BR>is necessary to 
consider the negative effects of agricultural pesticides on<BR>human, livestock 
and other living organisms, also look at the ways to<BR>minimise the impacts of 
these negative effects.<BR>Effect of Pesticides on Humans:<BR>Pesticide 
poisoning in developing countries occurs in variety of ways.<BR>The group most 
at risk is farm worker, who mixes and applies pesticides in<BR>the field, also 
enters in the field after spraying. In 1976 massive<BR>poisoning among spray men 
of Malaria Control Programme occurred in Pakistan,<BR>and more than 7500 field 
workers were affected and five of them died (WHO,<BR>1978). These injuries were 
result of mixing pesticides by hand and other<BR>poor practices (USAID, 
1977).<BR>The contamination of wheat with Parathion group led to 100 deaths 
in<BR>South India. In 1980, 250 villagers were poisoned in North India due 
to<BR>wheat contamination with BHC, during storage. According one report 
from<BR>Philippine when farmers used Genochlorine pesticides, the death rate 
in<BR>newborn children increased by 27 times in countryside. In December 
1987,<BR>pesticides poisoning in Hong Kong, due to eating Methamedophos 
contained<BR>spinach affected about 116 people. In California, hundreds of 
people were<BR>affected, when they ate pesticides treated melons. In south 
India, a<BR>mysterious disease affected 200 people in 40 villages, which began 
with<BR>intermittent pain in the hip and knee joints. This crippling deformity 
was<BR>linked with pesticide use (Bhat &amp; Kirshan, 1977). Although there are 
no<BR>figures available about Pakistan, the newspapers report do indicates 
that<BR>pesticide's poisoning prevails in Pakistan.<BR>Effect of Pesticides on 
Livestock:<BR>Increasing use of pesticides has contributed in livestock diseases 
and<BR>mortality in rural areas of Pakistan. In December 1997, in Landhi 
Karachi,<BR>40 buffaloes and cattle died due to unknown reasons. After 
laboratory tests<BR>it was identified that these animals died due to pesticide 
poisoning. After<BR>feed analysis it was found that their cotton seed cakes were 
contaminated<BR>with organo chlorine pesticide residue. In Tando Adam (Sindh), a 
herd of<BR>cattle and buffalo was affected due to pesticide poisoning, while the 
herd<BR>was grazing in fallow land besides cotton field, because cotton field 
was<BR>sprayed with pesticides.<BR>Effect of Pesticides on Environment:<BR>There 
are several processes that are active in transporting pesticides<BR>within or 
out of ecosystem. First process is volatilisation, in which<BR>pesticides 
evaporate in the air due to its higher vapour pressure. Second is<BR>movement of 
pesticides in dissolved state, this movement occurs in<BR>pesticides, which are 
water soluble in nature. Therefore, they leach out via<BR>macro-spores in soil, 
and contaminate ground water. Many pesticides<BR>transferred through air and 
during storms, pesticides can reach large urban<BR>cities, and cause eye 
problems and breathing problems in humans as well as<BR>in animals. Pesticides 
also kill beneficial insects and plants, which are<BR>essential for natural 
balance of our ecosystem.<BR>Conclusion:<BR>An organisation called Pesticide 
Action Network has prepared a list of<BR>hazardous pesticides. Eight of these 
hazardous chemicals are commonly used<BR>in developing countries. It is moral 
duty of developed and developing<BR>countries to ban all these chemicals. Some 
pesticides are banned in<BR>developed countries, but they are still sold and 
used in developing<BR>countries. Therefore it is the ethical duty of governments 
and researchers<BR>of developed world to stop all those multinational companies 
that are<BR>involved in such dirty business 
practices<BR>************************************************************************<BR>Integrated 
Pest Management (IPM): Components and Implementation<BR>By: Ghulam Hussain 
Mallah<BR>************************************************************************<BR>Pakistan 
is an agricultural country. More than 70% of the population is<BR>involved in 
agricultural related activities. Agriculture supplies most of<BR>the basic 
domestic food requirements plus 55% of the country's export<BR>earnings. In 
Pakistan human population is increasing at the rate of 2.9%<BR>annually; on the 
other hand, agricultural production worth of 2500 to 30000<BR>million Pak rupees 
is lost annually due to plant pests and diseases.<BR>Therefore, pesticides use 
is increasing every year to reduce production<BR>losses. For example, total 
consumption of pesticides was 3404 tonnes in<BR>1977, which increased to 5000 
tonnes in 1982.<BR>Increasing chemical inputs is not the only solution to 
getting higher<BR>agricultural production; particularly, increasing net profit 
per acre. Every<BR>year increase in the use of chemical fertiliser and 
pesticides have resulted<BR>in lower net profits and caused serious damage to 
human health and<BR>environment.<BR>Looking at the above problems in our country 
and toxicity of pesticides.<BR>It is important that the use of all types of 
pesticides should be gradually<BR>phased out and replaced by plants resistant to 
pests and diseases. Till such<BR>time IPM can be used as a tool to control the 
pests and reduce the<BR>pesticides application.<BR>IPM is the best combination 
of cultural, biological, behavioural and<BR>chemical measures, which yields the 
most cost-effective environmentally<BR>friendly and socially acceptable insect, 
disease and weed management in<BR>given situation. In IPM, narrow range, 
selective, short-term pesticides are<BR>used to control pest population, if they 
are not controlled by other means.<BR>Components of IPM:<BR>1. Cultural 
control<BR>2. Biological control<BR>3. Use of pheromones<BR>Use of microbial 
insecticides<BR>4. Pest scouting<BR>5. Rotational cropping<BR>Safe and efficient 
use of pesticides:<BR>1. Continuos of pesticides causes an insect resistance 
problem, thus use<BR>them for limited period<BR>2. Pesticides only used when 
pest population crosses thresh hold level.<BR>3. Use right pesticide and full 
dose.<BR>4. Well trained operator or technicians may be allowed to spray 
pesticides<BR>in the field<BR>Establishing the IPM Approach<BR>The use of IPM 
techniques require a good scientific knowledge in the<BR>following areas:<BR>1. 
The plant growth pattern of locally cultivated varieties, distribution of<BR>the 
major pests and a destination part of the plant, which can be attacked<BR>by the 
pests<BR>2. The effect of different planting dates on pest incidence<BR>3. The 
major natural mortality factors regulating the abundance and<BR>population 
dynamics of the pests<BR>4. The impact of the control procedures on the 
pests<BR>5. Rotational cropping<BR>6. Use of local natural chemical resources 
against pests (Neem Tree)<BR>It is therefore concluded that chemical method of 
pest control alone is<BR>not the only solution of the pest problem. There are 
several other<BR>alternatives to reduce the pest population. The concept of IPM 
is one of the<BR>important tools regarding controlling the pest population, 
which broadening<BR>the scope agro-ecosystem. IPM integrates several 
environmental friendly<BR>control methods and it does not entirely depend on use 
of pesticides.<BR>However, some times it is difficult to make balance between 
human food<BR>requirements and environmentally friendly methods to reduce pest 
attack and<BR>production 
losses.<BR>**********************************************************************<BR>Livestock 
and nutrient cycling: Maintaining an ecosystem balance<BR>Dr Rashid Ahmed 
Nizamani &amp; Dr Nasrullah 
Panhwer<BR>**********************************************************************<BR>Crop 
farming takes out the soil nutrients, because farmers plant their<BR>crops, 
harvest the plants and typically cart them away to the homestead.<BR>After that 
the grain is removed, which is either eaten by the family or<BR>sold. The 
remains of the plant may or may not be returned to the fields.<BR>Obviously, 
there is a net loss of nutrients from the cropland, a loss that<BR>can be 
dramatic if crop residues are not returned to the soil. Inevitably,<BR>land that 
is cropped year in, year out without any nutrients being added<BR>will not 
continue to support the same yields, hence crop yields fall. The<BR>role of 
livestock in helping put nutrients back into soil is well known by<BR>the 
world's small-scale farmers and by soil and livestock experts. But 
in<BR>developed countries, where artificial fertilisers are abundant 
and<BR>affordable, this role of livestock is in danger of being forgotten. In 
the<BR>developed world, livestock are now seen as consuming resources and 
producing<BR>pollutants. The contribution that livestock make to crop production 
is<BR>strongly influenced by human population density, cropping intensity 
and<BR>climate. At one extreme, in arid lands unsuitable for cropping, 
pastoralism<BR>is the only option for sustaining livelihoods. With rising 
population<BR>density and higher rainfall, there is increasing interaction 
between<BR>livestock and crops-livestock come to rely on crops for part of their 
feed,<BR>while crops benefit from nutrients delivered as faeces and urine from 
the<BR>livestock. At the other extreme, in densely populated, intensively 
cropped<BR>regions, such as South-East Asia, livestock are highly valued by 
farmers as<BR>a means of producing fertiliser, converting plant material quickly 
and<BR>efficiently into a form that can be applied to the soil to maintain 
crop<BR>yields.<BR>Two routes from soil to soil<BR>Why involve livestock in 
cycling nutrients in crops back to soil? Why<BR>not just put the crop residues 
back on the land and let them decompose?<BR>There are several reasons why 
livestock are important to this process on<BR>small-holder farms. Firstly, 
cereal crop residues are often relatively slow<BR>to decompose Grazing cattle on 
crop residues in semi-arid West Africa.<BR>Livestock manure and urine are vital 
sources of nutrients for crop<BR>production in many parts of the developing 
world. Pose in soil, so it can be<BR>a long time before the nutrients in the 
crop residues become available to<BR>the subsequent crop. Also, while the soil 
microbes are breaking down the<BR>crop residues, they can actually tie up soil 
nitrogen for their own use,<BR>reducing the amount of nitrogen avail-able to 
plants. Thus, it may be months<BR>before the nutrients are available to 
plants.<BR>However, if one feeds crop residues to ruminant livestock, microbes 
in the<BR>animal's stomach break down the plant materials rapidly. The excreta, 
such<BR>as faeces and urine contain nutrients in forms that are more 
readily<BR>available to plants. The nutrients not excreted are converted to 
valuable<BR>animal products like milk, meat, fibre, tractive power 
etc.<BR>Livestock do more than speed up nutrient turnover through the process 
of<BR>digestion. As animals eat the palatable parts of the crop 
residues-the<BR>leaves for example-inedible fractions such as the stems are 
trampled<BR>underfoot (particularly if animals are stall-fed), where they mix 
with the<BR>faeces and soak up urine. Trampling by the animal breaks up the 
stover,<BR>speeding the decomposition process and increasing the capacity of the 
stover<BR>to absorb urine. Nitrogen in animal urine is commonly 'lost' 
through<BR>volatilisation, but using crop residues to soak up the urine 
improves<BR>nutrient 'capture'. 'Animal-processed' inedible fractions of crop 
residues<BR>compost faster, making the nutrients in them available 
sooner.<BR>The semi-arid zone includes parts of 48 developing countries in 
Africa,<BR>Asia and Latin America, home to roughly one-sixth of the world's 
population.<BR>This is one of the most fragile, vulnerable agro-ecological 
zones. Its soils<BR>are sandy, contain little organic matter, are poorly 
structured and hold<BR>little water. Many of them crust over easily when they 
dry, making it<BR>difficult for seeds to germinate, and they are all easily 
eroded by water<BR>and by wind. Large parts of the world's semi-arid lands can 
only be used<BR>sustainably by ruminant livestock, and then only if their 
numbers are<BR>controlled and they are free to move over long distances, 
following the<BR>region's sparse and erratic rain. But increasing human 
population is<BR>reducing the freedom of livestock herders to roam and driving 
farmers to<BR>crop land that once was under permanent grassland, exposing the 
soil to<BR>erosion and depriving livestock of grazing. Even where cropping is 
feasible,<BR>the traditional fallowing system has broken down under the pressure 
to<BR>produce more food, hastening the decline in the already low soil 
fertility.<BR>The high price of inorganic fertilisers, inappropriate policies 
and<BR>difficulties in getting agricultural inputs to rural areas mean that 
few<BR>farmers use improved crop varieties or fertilisers. Manure is often the 
only<BR>fertiliser used by smallholder farmers in this zone.<BR>The easy 
answers, such as not to cultivate fragile land and to limit the<BR>number of 
livestock kept on the land, don't work in the real world. What<BR>farmers and 
livestock owners need are options that help them produce the<BR>food and income 
they need to provide for their families and to contribute to<BR>the development 
of their societies. One such option -indeed one of very few<BR>workable 
options-is to integrate cropping and livestock rearing in ways that<BR>allow 
each activity to support the other, minimising competition for<BR>resources. 
This is the approach needed in fragile 
areas.<BR>**********************<BR>SLAP's
