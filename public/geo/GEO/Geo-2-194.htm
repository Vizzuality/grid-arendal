      <CENTER>OVERVIEW</CENTER>
      <P>
      <P>The countries of the ESCWA region are characterized by great 
      differences of surface area, natural resources endowment, population, 
      income level of socio-economic development and so on. The environmental 
      degradation of the region is continuing in many areas. However, the 
      regions' identity, shaped by a similar environment and ecosystems, as well 
      as a common heritage and history, compels ESCWA countries to find remedies 
      for the underlying causes of environmental degradation.
      <P>
      <P>During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, economic growth in the ESCWA 
      region was the highest in the world, primarily due to oil exports. During 
      these years, in a drive for self-sufficiency, the region embarked on a 
      strategy of industrial and agricultural protectionism supported by trade 
      barriers, a strategy encouraged by publicly subsidized energy, water, and 
      agro-chemicals. However, the economic growth of most ESCWA countries 
      during the 1980s witnessed slow or even negative growth, due to falling 
      oil prices. By the 1990s, many ESCWA governments, in their attempt to 
      compensate for the "lost decade", initiated economic reform programmes to 
      improve resource efficiency and encourage private sector growth. In this 
      process, however, the ESCWA region came face to face with the 
      unsustainable legacy of its development strategy, in which unsustainable 
      use of natural resources and widespread environmental degradation were 
      caused by: massive extraction and inefficient use of water for irrigation, 
      encouraged by low or non-cost water and lack of incentives for 
      conservation and allocation to higher value uses; lack of adequate natural 
      resources tenure rights and population, combined with rapid population 
      growth and urbanization; lack of cost recovery by water and sanitation 
      services, which has constrained finances available for extending and 
      improving the provision of services; energy policies with non 
      accountability that continue to supply fuel oil with a high sulfur content 
      and leaded gasoline; high energy consumption in relation to economic 
      output by low energy prices; high polluting public enterprises still 
      responsible for the bulk of industrial air and water pollution; and old, 
      fuel-inefficient and highly polluting vehicle fleets, the replacement of 
      which is discouraged by high import barriers and in particular in 
      populated countries of the region.
      <P>
      <P>Today, as many of the ESCWA countries move towards economic reform and 
      trade integration among themselves and with neighboring countries, 
      particularly the European Union, the region is facing many environmental 
      challenges, such as:
      <P>
      <P>. An increasing number of people are exposed to urban air pollution 
      caused by dust, particulates, lead, and sulfur dioxide;
      <P>. Most countries already consume more freshwater resources than can be 
      renewed, relying on the depletion of non-renewable aquifers and/or 
      expensive desalinization of seawater;
      <P>. An increasing number of people lack safe drinking water (In 
      particular the case of Iraq) and most rural areas of non-GCC countries 
      suffer from the lack of sanitation and drinking water.
      <P>. Land, pasture, and forest degradation is increasing economic pressure 
      on the rural people of regional countries with agricultural potential;
      <P>
      <P>Such problems of unsustainable development need to be addressed in 
      order to diminish the compounded economic and social costs if left 
      unattended. As such, most ESCWA countries have restructured their 
      environmental institutions with the issuance of environmental guidelines, 
      standards, laws, rules, and regulations for proper environmental 
      management. At the national level, ESCWA countries vary in formulating 
      national environmental strategies for the purpose of integrating 
      environmental dimensions into their development schemes. While prior to 
      UNCED the plans simply concentrated on development strategies, some 
      countries now incorporate environmental policies and resource management 
      principles into their development plans. The attached table reflects 
      various forms of institutions at the national level entrusted with 
      environment and sustainable development in the ESCWA region.

      <P></B>ESCWA countries are aware of the recent increase in the formulation 
      of treaties on environmental protection, which basically involve the 
      formulation of comprehensive umbrella agreements stating the general goals 
      of the parties, but do not impose any mechanisms which oblige them to 
      achieve these goals. International agreements related to biological 
      diversity and natural habitats have been ratified by four countries of the 
      region. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
      Wild Fauna and Flora (Washington, 1973) has been ratified by three 
      countries: Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Agreements relating 
      to the prevention and control of pollution, which include the United 
      Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992), have been ratified 
      by eight ESCWA countries; the International Convention to Combat 
      Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or 
      Desertification particularly in Africa (1994) has been ratified by four 
      ESCWA countries; the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary 
      Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (1989), has been ratified 
      by ten countries, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
      Ozone Layer by nine ESCWA countries.
      <P>
      <P>As can be noted in the attached table, the level of participation by 
      ESCWA countries in international agreements is moderate, reflecting the 
      prevailing status of least developed country (case of Yemen), the UN 
      imposed economic sanctions (Iraq) and, in some cases, lack of support or 
      disagreement with the objectives or specific provisions of treaties. The 
      attached table reflects the status of ESCWA countries ratification of 
      international treaties on the environment, including regional seas 
      programmes initiated by UNEP. 
      <P>
      <P>It is clear from this review that sustainable development policy is now 
      a concern of virtually all ESCWA countries. However, the programmes, laws, 
      and institutions that have been created have grown haphazardly and are 
      largely sectoral. In most ESCWA countries, different institutions are 
      responsible for agriculture, water, fisheries, mineral resources, 
      occupational and environmental health, development control, human 
      settlements, industry, transport and tourism. Recognition of the 
      inter-sectoral nature of sustainable development concerns is causing an 
      increasing number of governments to develop cross-cutting policies, laws 
      and institutions, and many are also seeking to bridge the gaps between 
      public and private sectors, and non-government organizations. Within the 
      government, the machinery commonly takes the form of inter-ministerial or 
      interdepartmental committees, while the policies are often expressed in 
      national environmental strategies, developed in consultation with sectoral 
      departments. Even then, sustainable development policies are generally 
      implemented through the traditional sectoral machinery.
      <P>
      <P>National, regional and international actions are clearly closely 
      linked. The articulation of regional programmes and institutions, backed 
      by regional conventions and other legal instruments, will help to extend 
      the shared interest among ESCWA regional countries to protect the 
      environment and promote sustainable development. The increasing 
      recognition of global problems is in turn leading to the rapid growth in 
      international legal instruments concerned with the environment. Again, 
      this growth in international obligations poses serious problems for many 
      ESCWA countries, because the obligations they incur are far from cost or 
      resource free.

      <P>In terms of poverty, the situation varies among ESCWA countries. 
      However, there are few government programmes which help low-income groups 
      to improve their earning potential or their quality of life. In the 
      cities, the crowding of the poor in communities lacking adequate 
      infrastructure and decent housing leads to an accumulation of waste which 
      increases contamination and unsustainable development.
      <P>
      <P>In synthesis, we are witnessing two interacting processes: the 
      consolidation and expansion of methods of development and styles of 
      consumption which are clearly unsustainable, and the generation of 
      poverty. On the other hand, it is increasingly clear that the 
      unsustainable growth followed in the last few decades has generated 
      pockets of poverty in every society with overall effects on the 
      deterioration of the quality of life, increasing unemployment, decreasing 
      labour productivity, and rural migration to towns and cities. The urban 
      areas of middle-income countries of the region, facing an increasing 
      pressure can not always support the increase in migration from the rural 
      areas, leading to the creation of slums and squatter settlements and the 
      continuation of poverty and deprivation cycles (cases of Egypt and Yemen 
      in particular).
      <P>
      <P>To tackle these problems, ESCWA has initiated various activities during 
      1995-1996 including technical studies on: measurement of poverty in the 
      ESCWA region; poverty in Western Asia: a social perspective; poverty 
      profiles of Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine; poverty in the Arab World; a 
      conceptual and methodological framework for poverty alleviation in the 
      ESCWA region; women and poverty in the ESCWA region; poverty in Lebanon; 
      problems of social integration in post-war Lebanon under structural 
      adjustment; poverty and housing in the ESCWA region; and the impact of 
      selected macro-economic and social policies on poverty. In sum, these 
      studies conclude that environmental deterioration, population, health 
      conditions and development are inextricably entwined. Unsustainable 
      development will ultimately affect the health of the people. The human 
      cost expressed in poverty, suffering, and avoidable illness and mortality, 
      is the real cause behind poverty in the ESCWA region. The following table, 
      extracted from studies undertaken by ESCWA, reflect poverty indices (1992) 
      for this region.

      <P>It is commonly believed that demographic patterns and trends such as 
      population size, growth rates and distribution, have contributed 
      significantly to shaping the status of development in the ESCWA region, 
      and to increasing the severity of environmental problems. However, 
      problems such as desertification, soil degradation, deforestation, loss of 
      biodiversity, water and air pollution are also the result of other aspects 
      of the human condition, such as cultural, social, and economic status, 
      traditionally acquired technologies, institutional and legal systems, 
      changing consumption patterns and, above all, poverty and its impact on 
      attitudes towards resource value.
      <P>
      <P>In terms of demographic patterns, ESCWA countries vary in population, 
      from little over half a million (Bahrain and Qatar) to well over 62 
      million (Egypt). Egypt is the largest country of the ESCWA region, with 
      43% of its total population, followed by Iraq and Yemen (24%), 
      representing the population affected by economic sanctions (Iraq) and the 
      least developed country (Yemen). Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the 
      Syrian Arab Republic, the Western Mediterranean ESCWA countries, represent 
      17% of the population, followed by the GCC countries (16%). Population 
      growth rates, population density, and urbanization are good indicators of 
      likely environmental stress. Existing population growth rates and 
      densities in countries such as Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Yemen 
      correlate with expected environmental stress in these countries. This 
      environmental stress due to rapid population growth and urbanization is 
      manifested in natural resources deterioration, affecting particularly the 
      quality of air and water. Another environmental impact of a rapidly 
      expanding population is the increased pressure on arable land, both as a 
      result of intensified agriculture, and the loss of land due to the 
      expansion of human settlements.
      <P>
      <P>In the area of demographic dynamics and sustainability, the ESCWA 
      secretariat has initiated several technical studies on: Demographic and 
      related socio-economic indicators; database for demographic estimates and 
      projections. Furthermore, in cooperation with the UNFPA, the secretariat 
      organized an expert group meeting on population policies and sustainable 
      development in the Arab region (December 1996).

      <P>In the past two decades, the cities of the ESCWA region have seen the 
      most radical transformation ever experienced in their millennia of urban 
      development. Within the space of a single generation, urban population has 
      increased drastically. This high growth rate has been fueled by massive 
      rural to urban migration, prompted by grinding rural poverty and 
      agricultural land degradation, a consequence of over-cultivation and 
      over-grazing, induced by an increase in the region's population. 
      <P>
      <P>During the first half of the nineties, about 56 percent of the 
      population of the region was estimated to live in urban areas. However, 
      with current growth rates, the region is expected to become predominantly 
      urban in the next 25 years, with the proportion of population living in 
      urban areas expected to reach 59 per cent by the year 2000.
      <P>(refer to the table below) 
      <P>
      <P>Such an increase has considerable implications on human settlement 
      development, even if present densities are maintained (countries with 
      urbanization rates over 70% include Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, 
      Lebanon, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), 
      the overall extent of urban areas will increase with tremendous pressure 
      on infrastructure and deterioration of environmental conditions. From an 
      economic, environmental and social point of view, waste is a particularly 
      acute problem confronting big cities in the region. There are a few fairly 
      well known examples which can be mentioned with regard to economic waste. 
      The first relates to the part of urban material endowment (roads, for 
      example) whose size is not determined on the basis of actual hours of peak 
      use. Another example relates to the premature obsolescence of some urban 
      property in expensive areas of cities in which buildings are razed 
      although they are still in good condition, and replaced by others which 
      allow for denser occupation of the land, hence gaining greater financial 
      return from it (Cases of Cairo, Beirut, and Damascus).
      <P>
      <P>In conclusion, the issues of urbanization and urban settlement 
      development are closely linked to the state of the environment and 
      poverty. Although this is a worldwide fact, in the case of ESCWA region, 
      the link between environment, poverty and urbanization is more pronounced 
      due to the specific socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the 
      region, and the priority given by ESCWA countries to the objectives of the 
      various programme areas outlined in chapter 7 of Agenda 21. These include 
      also rapid urbanization and economic growth of large cities and coastal 
      areas, very low arable land, and the persistence of poverty in rural and 
      urban areas of middle-income countries of the region. To remedy this 
      situation, ESCWA has recently undertaken the following research 
      activities: technological and social aspects of upgrading and revitalizing 
      settlements; regional perspective of human settlements in ESCWA countries; 
      proceedings of the expert group meeting in preparation for the UN 
      Conference on Human Settlements, Habitat II; and poverty in West Asia: 
      extent and measures for its alleviation: crisis, poverty, and shelter.

      <P>The prevailing systems for decision-making in many ESCWA countries tend 
      to separate economic, technological, social, and environmental factors at 
      the policy, planning, and management levels. This influences the actions 
      of all groups in society, including government, industry, and individuals, 
      and has important implications for the efficiency and sustainability of 
      development. An adjustment or even restriction of decision-making, in the 
      light of each country's specific conditions, may be necessary to accord 
      priority to environmental and technological concerns and a full 
      integration of these factors. Significant changes in the institutional 
      stuctures of governments would be necessary to enable a more systematic 
      consideration of the environment when decisions are made on economic, 
      industrial, technological and other sectoral policies. New forms of 
      dialogue should also be developed for achieving better integration among 
      regional, national, and local institutions representing industry, science 
      and research, development centers, academics, environmental groups, and 
      the public, in developing effective approaches to the integration of 
      environment and development in decision making. It is for this reason that 
      a number of ESCWA countries have set up interministerial working groups or 
      commissions empowered to ensure effective cooperation among all government 
      departments concerned.
      <P>
      <P>More extensive use of analytical tools for improving decision-making, 
      such as cost-benefit analysis, environmental impact assessment, and 
      environmental indicators and accounting, can also contribute to policy 
      integration by making both private and public decision makers more aware 
      of the environmental consequences of their actions. The EIA, as an 
      environmental management tool is gaining popularity in the ESCWA region. 
      However, the use of environmental audit has not yet become common practice 
      due to various reasons, including the reluctance to release information 
      pertaining to their environmental records and the possibilities of legal 
      requirements to protect the society at large from harmful pollutants (Case 
      of Lebanon).

      <P>Environmental problems of industrial origin and issues regarding 
      atmosphere are a relatively recent phenomenon in the ESCWA region, 
      although some countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Syrian 
      Arab Republic have for a long time experienced the adverse impacts of 
      industrialization in certain parts of their region. The nature, scope, and 
      extent of the impact of industrial development, and hence the protection 
      of the atmosphere vary in different areas of the region. 
      <P>
      <P>At the policy statement level, all ESCWA countries seem to have acted 
      to abate industrial pollution, promote new and renewable energy sources, 
      facilitate cleaner transportation fleet and protect the atmosphere. 
      However, there has been a failure to translate these statements into 
      action depending on the socio-economic situation of individual countries. 
      Some policy makers in the middle-income group of countries in the region 
      disregard protection of the atmosphere, due to economic hardship, 
      unemployment and poverty, regardless of its environmental impacts. 
      Furthermore, while environmental consciousness is taking root, it is 
      happening rather slowly in the industrial and business sectors in the 
      region. The private industrial sector in the region has neglected adopting 
      environmentally friendly technologies and incorporating issues regarding 
      the protection of the atmosphere in their production process. This 
      reflects the low-level of research and development which is undertaken by 
      private firms for the development of environmental technology research. 
      The major obstacles to the "greening" of industry, transport, energy and 
      business in the region are caused by existing environmental policies which 
      do not correct biases caused by the underpricing of natural resources; 
      they do not ensure that new industries and plants employ the cleanest 
      technology available, or that existing plants are upgraded as necessary 
      and practicable, and they do not promote "green" consumerism.

      <P>The land use pattern in the ESCWA region has undergone continuous 
      changes, manifesting the impact of the complex interplay of 
      socio-economic, political, and technological forces. A comparison of land 
      use patterns in ESCWA countries with the rest of the world shows the 
      scarcity of arable land in the region. While the world's average of arable 
      and cropland is 11 percent, it stands at 4.3 percent in the ESCWA region, 
      compared to 15 percent in the Asia-Pacific region. The desert terrain and 
      other unfavorable agro-ecological land is about 63 percent of the total 
      area of the ESCWA region. Furthermore, the limited arable land is 
      suffering from intense development and population pressure. There is a 
      tendency towards more intensive and extensive cultivation in countries 
      with the most croplands, which also have high population densities. The 
      population pressure on arable land is noticeable in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, 
      Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen. Irrigated land is being 
      cultivated year-round, with increasing applications of water, fertilizer, 
      and pesticides. Simultaneously, large areas of fertile land are being 
      taken out of production for urban, transport and industrial needs, land of 
      low quality is being overused as herds overgraze ranges, and marginal 
      farmers cultivate low rainfall areas without adequate following or 
      fertilization. 
      <P>
      <P>This pressure on the land is being felt on a region where the land 
      surface itself is generally fragile, often already degraded, and subject 
      to high levels of natural erosion exacerbated by severe sand storms and 
      population densities. Nonetheless, the historical process that has shaped 
      the ESCWA region's landscape is continuing at an accelerating rate and 
      great socio-economic cost. Land previously under agricultural production 
      has given way to urban settings, and new areas of cultivation are unlikely 
      to compensate for the loss of agricultural land to urbanization and 
      related transport networks. Furthermore, expensive land reclamation and 
      intensification efforts are proceeding as productive and scarce arable 
      lands are irreversibly lost to urbanization, municipalities and industrial 
      uses. The new and little reported expansion in arable land area in the 
      ESCWA countries has taken place at the expense of natural rangeland.
      <P>
      <P>On policy issues, regional countries differ, depending on their 
      economic status, availability of resources and population pressure, to the 
      degree of moving from current unsustainable management of land resources 
      to a sustainable and integrated management of the same resources. Most 
      ESCWA countries are giving priority to land management to preserve their 
      food security status and to strengthen and improve institutional 
      mechanisms for land management resources.

      <P>The forest and woodland in the ESCWA region occupies about 1.03 percent 
      of the region's total area. The distribution of forests varies among the 
      countries of the region, depending on physical, ecological and social 
      factors. Four countries, including Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
      Iraq, Jordan and to some extent Yemen have forest areas in the region. 
      However, deforestation continues to be a problem of serious concern in 
      Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Furthermore, forest cover has declined 
      dramatically in the countries of the region during the past decades. 
      Countries such as Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen have suffered extensive loss of 
      forests accompanied by soil erosion, as a result of conflicts and civil 
      war, which have caused widespread environmental problems with negative 
      socio-economic and ecological consequences. 
      <P>
      <P>As far as policy objectives of chapter 11 of Agenda 21 are concerned, 
      there is diversity of forest policies among the countries of the region, 
      depending on their awareness of future and current priorities. At the 
      national level, the main focus of concerned countries has been on forestry 
      plans, rules and regulations, institutional developments and 
      implementation of programmes related to proper management and protection 
      of forests. Some countries such as Jordan, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
      and Lebanon have made provisions in their national development plans for 
      protection of forests. Other countries' concerns are reflected in the 
      establishment of departments relating to forests and environment.

      <P>More than three quarters of the ESCWA region is desert, and an 
      increasing part of the permanent pasture areas is subject to erosion 
      because of reduced vegetation cover. In addition, much of the cropland is 
      losing its inherent productivity because of poor agricultural practices. 
      Soil erosion is another aspect of the desertification process in the 
      region, which begins with intensive livestock grazing. Furthermore, dry 
      land salinity is causing serious problems in Western Asia, due to reduced 
      evaporation, allowing salts to concentrate in the low-lying parts of the 
      landscape. In Egypt, for example, an estimated 32 percent of the Nile 
      Delta and 30 percent of the Nile Valley are affected by salination and 
      water logging, lowering or totally eliminating their potential for crop 
      production. Much of Egypt's salination is recent, the result of excessive 
      water use and inadequate drainage. In Iraq, salinity and water logging 
      affect more than 50 percent of the lower Rafadain Plain. In the Syrian 
      Arab Republic about 50 percent of the irrigated land in the Euphrates 
      Valley is seriously affected by salinity and water logging.
      <P>
      <P>The problem of land degradation in the ESCWA region's arid and 
      semi-arid areas (desertification), is being tackled through a variety of 
      measures including increased vegetation cover, plants for dune 
      stabilization, and improved land use practices. The secretariat of ESCWA, 
      in cooperation with UNEP and regional countries, has produced various 
      desertification control plans to address the issue through appropriate 
      policy intervention, along with national authorities and community 
      involvement. 
      <P>
      <P>The United Nations Conference on Desertification (Nairobi, 1977) played 
      a major role in increasing awareness of the serious threats to land from 
      unsustainable exploitation and anthropogenic pressures at both national 
      and international levels. It also resulted in the initiation of several 
      actions at these levels to arrest further spread of desertification. 
      During 1993-1995, the ESCWA secretariat completed the following related 
      technical reports: Desertification control project, integrated natural 
      resources management for sustainable development in Bahrain; The national 
      plan of action to combat desertification in the Sultanate of Oman; The 
      national plan of action to combat desertification in the United Arab 
      Emirates; and Resource conservation policies and strategies for 
      agriculture in the Syrian Arab Republic.
      <P>
      <P>A recent major international achievement is the development of the 
      International Convention to Combat Desertification, which was initiated at 
      UNCED. The convention was developed through negotiations in Paris on June 
      18, 1994. Most ESCWA countries have adhered to this convention. 
      Furthermore, ESCWA participates actively in the deliberations of the 
      Steering Committee on Desertification of the Council of Arab Ministers 
      responsible for the environment. This Committee meets annually and is an 
      umbrella network for government representatives and other regional 
      research and training institutions concerned with desertification. 
      However, considering the severity and complexity of desertification and 
      the magnitude of its negative consequences, current efforts to promote 
      preventive approaches for the control of land degradation are far too 
      inadequate and uneven in the ESCWA region as a whole.

      <P>Among the causes of unsustainable agricultural practices and 
      degradation of agricultural land in the region are the inadequate or 
      inappropriate policies which include pricing, subsidies, and tax policies 
      which have encouraged the excessive and often uneconomic use of inputs 
      such as fertilizers and pesticides, and over exploitation of land.
      <P>These policies, together with supporting economic and financial 
      policies, have contributed to a rate of depleting of land and water 
      resources in many ESCWA countries which have not been sustainable in the 
      long run. Furthermore, although various other economic and social factors 
      are responsible for land degradation in the ESCWA region, the 
      deterioration of agricultural land is leading to a decrease in food 
      security in many ESCWA countries in the short run, and to over 
      exploitation of the natural resource base, on which agriculture depends in 
      the long run. Taking population increase into consideration, the per 
      capita arable land and, consequently, per capita food production in some 
      ESCWA countries are deteriorating further than its level in the seventies. 
      This situation is particularly visible in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, the Syrian 
      Arab Republic and Yemen, where the decrease in per capita food production 
      was partly due to the inefficiencies of land use, fragmentation and 
      reduction in arable land per agricultural population (refer to the table 
      below). 
      <P>
      <P>In line with promoting the main programme areas relevant to the ESCWA 
      countries, the secretariat, in cooperation with the Council of Arab 
      Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE), organized an inter-Arab 
      regions conference (Cairo, september 1994) on sustainable agriculture and 
      rural development. The broad objectives of the meeting were: (i) to 
      increase the awareness and mobilize the agricultural sector to implement 
      related chapters of Agenda 21 and Arab Programmes for Sustainable 
      Development (APSD); (ii) to promote priority programmes, at the national 
      level, related to chapter 17 of Agenda 21 and other relevant Agenda 21 
      programme areas; (iii) promote inter-regional and regional cooperation for 
      the implementation of (APSD) and; (iv) to exchange views and experience in 
      preparing plans and programmes of action related to (APSD), and the 
      identification of priority areas of joint action programmes for the 
      implementation of chapter 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 of Agenda 21. The 
      recommendations of the meeting covered issues of: (i) macro-economic 
      adjustment and agricultural policies; (ii) regional institutional 
      framework for sustainable agriculture and rural development, (iii) human 
      development and participation; (iv) land-use development; (v) water 
      conservation and management; (vi) chemical uses in agriculture; and (vii) 
      use of modern technologies. 
      <P>
      <P>At the secretariat level, ESCWA continues its capacity building for 
      member countries in addition to training, field projects and promotion of 
      integrated agricultural development along the main objectives of chapter 
      14 of Agenda 21. At the national level, ESCWA countries differ in priority 
      settings and initiatives according to their socio-economic and 
      agricultural realities and visions.

      <P>The first organized societies evolved in the ESCWA region (Egyptian, 
      Babylonian, Phoenician, Byzantine, and Arab Empires). They all prospered 
      because their people mastered the skills of irrigation, agriculture, plant 
      and animal domestication, hunting and fishing. Their activities covered a 
      mosaic of landscapes that included desert, oases, dry land, wet land, 
      mountains, plateaus, planes, lakes, marshland, and coastlines along the 
      Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and 
      the Persian Gulf. However, the excessive use of these resources caused 
      their depletion or degradation of the habitat, where the process of 
      desertification started. A number of these early cultures made efforts to 
      allocate and control the use of diminishing resources in their arid 
      region. These measures included, for example, the strict rationing of 
      water, access to grazing and the cutting of trees, firewood collection and 
      agricultural land ownership. Unfortunately these control measures did not 
      stop natural resource degradation. Hence, in the ESCWA region widespread 
      negative impacts on biodiversity are occurring mainly through habitat 
      destruction caused by the pressures of population growth, ignorance, 
      poverty and economic development. 
      <P>
      <P>Due to the lack of accurate information in many ESCWA countries, there 
      is uncertainty regarding the present status and trends of biodiversity. 
      This deficiency is now being addressed by various organizations, both at 
      the national and regional levels. On the whole, there is little 
      information on species and reliable data is generally limited to certain 
      mammals and birds. The population status of these groups is used as an 
      indication of species diversity. Species inventories have not been 
      completed, but are currently being undertaken in a number of countries in 
      the region (i.e. Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen). Furthermore, some 
      ESCWA countries have ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and 
      the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
      and Flora. The status of ESCWA countries on these two conventions was 
      reflected in the first part of this report. 
      <P>
      <P>In response to international pressure and national awareness, many 
      ESCWA countries have began to establish a system of protected areas in an 
      effort to combat habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. However, 
      the administration of national parks and protected areas are under various 
      public authorities with conflicting rather than complimentary plans of 
      action. According to the latest (1995) List of National Parks and 
      Protected Areas, protected areas total about 251 million hectares or just 
      about 5.4 percent of the total in the ESCWA region.
      <P>
      <P>In October 1995, ESCWA participated in planning and convening "The 
      Meeting of the Arab Expert Group on Biodiversity in Arab Countries", to 
      underline the programme objectives of chapter 16 of Agenda 21 and the 
      Convention on Biodiversity and its implications for the Arab countries. 
      This meeting focused on the following themes: the state of biodiversity in 
      the Arab countries, according to available data; ways and means for 
      biodiversity conservation in the Arab region ; biodiversity in the context 
      of sustainable development; and the institutional and legal framework as 
      means for capacity building to enhance biodiversity conservation in the 
      Arab countries. The Arab Center for the Study of Arid Zones and Dry Lands 
      (ACSAD), which acted as technical secretariat for the meeting was 
      requested to follow-up on the recommendations of the meeting including the 
      initiation of a Pan-Arab Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy. 
      Furthermore, the Arab countries were requested to establish a national 
      committee to coordinate among various national institutions matters 
      related to (i) National policy and action plans for the conservation and 
      sustainable use of biodiversity; (ii) Establishment of natural habitats 
      and national parks to preserve different elements of biodiversity for 
      future sustainable utilization; (iii) Adoption of a national strategy for 
      public awareness, education and technical training for the preservation of 
      biodiversity. At the regional level, the need for clear, precise and 
      practical guiding principles was recognized. In this context, reference 
      was also made to the need to initiate an innovative, pro-active and 
      cooperative approach to limiting the degradation of biodiversity in the 
      Arab region. Furthermore, another follow-up meeting is scheduled for 1997 
      to elaborate on the Pan-Arab Biodiversity Strategy.

    <TD>A survey of the availability of water resources indicates that there 
      are large variations from country to country within the ESCWA region, 
      depending on the physiographical and hydrogeological setting. Among ESCWA 
      countries, Egypt, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Lebanon, have 
      relatively dependable surface water sources, in the form of major rivers 
      and springs. River flow in these countries originates both within and 
      outside of national boundaries. In addition to available surface water, 
      the water supply is supplemented through extraction from groundwater 
      reserves in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the West 
      Bank and Gaza. Jordan is faced with water deficits, and the West Bank and 
      Gaza have limited surface water and renewable groundwater sources to meet 
      their needs. Surface water and groundwater reserves are frequently renewed 
      through rainfall, perennial river flow, and floods. The Nile in Egypt, the 
      Euphrates and Tigris in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Orentis and 
      Latani in Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, and the lower Jordan river 
      in Jordan, represent major water sources for domestic, industrial, and 
      agricultural requirements within these countries. In contrast, the GCC 
      countries and Yemen are characterized by a harsh desert environment and 
      are devoid of rivers and lakes. Their water resources consist of limited 
      quantities of runoff resulting from flash floods, groundwater in the 
      alluvial aquifers, and extensive groundwater reserves in the deep 
      sedimentary formations. Some of these countries also rely on 
      non-conventional water sources such as desalination of sea and brackish 
      water, and limited use of renovated waste water.
      <P>
      <P>Water allocation from the Nile river in Egypt is estimated at 56.5 
      billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, while the estimates for the Euphrates 
      and Tigris in the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq are 26.8 bcm and 76.9 bcm 
      respectively. The average surface water flow in Lebanon is estimated at 
      2.5 bcm, while for Jordan it is 0.875 bcm. The major problem associated 
      with the management of surface water is the transboundary nature of rivers 
      shared by member and non-member countries. Typical examples are the Nile 
      and Euphrates rivers, where the headwaters are located outside the ESCWA 
      region. Lack of formal agreements for sharing flow from the Euphrates and 
      the Tigris has created serious shortcomings in efficient water 
      utilization. A number of large dams have been constructed on these rivers 
      to regulate the water flow. The water stored behind the dams is the main 
      source for domestic, irrigation, and industrial purposes in Egypt, Iraq, 
      and the Syrian Arab Republic, and to a limited extent in Jordan and 
      Lebanon. Surface water in the extremely arid GCC countries and Yemen 
      consist of runoff generated by flash floods. The average annual volume of 
      water generated from floods is estimated at 5.3 bcm. The intermittent 
      nature of the flow renders it an unreliable source. The total average 
      annual water generated in Saudi Arabia and Yemen is estimated at 2.2 bcm 
      and 2.1 bcm respectively. The amount of surface water available in Oman 
      and the United Arab Emirates is estimated at 0.92 bcm and 0.12 bcm, 
      respectively. The remaining GCC countries have only negligible amounts of 
      surface runoff. 
      <P>
      <P>Groundwater resources in the ESCWA region consist of water stored in 
      both shallow and deep aquifers. Carbonate aquifers are predominant in 
      Jordan, Lebanon, and the Syrian Arab Republic, while sandstone is 
      predominant in northern Egypt and southern Iraq. Shallow quaternary wadi 
      deposits located in the costal plains and inland basins, as well as the 
      alluviums of rive flood plains, contain groundwater of good quality that 
      is frequently recharged by perennial river flows. The shallow aquifers in 
      Egypt's Nile delta, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
      the West Bank hold groundwater reserves adequate to partially meet their 
      respective water requirements. This region also contains aquifers of large 
      aerial extent in which significant reserves of groundwater, with varying 
      degrees of salinity, are stored. Water quality in relation to salinity and 
      its location at considerable depths, however, determine how the water can 
      be used. Groundwater reserves of the shallow alluvial aquifers also 
      represent one of the main sources for many of the countries of the Arabian 
      Peninsula. Alluvial deposits along the main wadi channels and flood plains 
      of drainage basins make up the shallow groundwater system in Kuwait, Oman, 
      Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Groundwater in the 
      shallow aquifers is the only renewable water source in these countries. 
      Another main source of water in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia is 
      the non-renewable fossil groundwater stored in the sedimentary deep 
      aquifers. These aquifers store significant amounts of groundwater that are 
      thousands of years old. The major aquifers are the Saq, Tabuk, Wajid, 
      Minjur-druma, Wacia-Biyadh, Dammam, Um Er-Radhuma, and Neogene. These 
      aquifers cover two- thirds of Saudi Arabia and some of them extend into 
      Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, as well 
      as Iraq, Jordan, and the Syrian Arab Republic. </P>

    <TD>(cont.)
      <P>Non-conventional water sources are being utilized to supplement natural 
      sources in order to satisfy water requirements in many of the ESCWA member 
      countries. Brackish and sea water desalination has also become a viable 
      alternative to meet raising demand. The GCC countries rely largely on 
      desalination to help satisfy domestic water demand, and during the last 20 
      years these countries have become increasingly dependent on desalination 
      to meet their water supply requirements. They have become, by necessity, 
      world leaders in desalination of sea water and brackish groundwater for 
      domestic consumption. The high salinity of groundwater in most GCC 
      countries has compelled them to rely on desalinated water. Current 
      desalinated water output, produced from numerous desalination plants 
      located in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, 
      and Yemen, reached 1.7 bcm in 1995, compared to a world-wide capacity of 
      5.7 bcm. Limited amounts of desalinated water are being produced in Egypt, 
      Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic, mainly through the private sector, in 
      comparison to the GCC countries where desalination is relatively more 
      common. These capacities cover all desalination plants and include 
      numerous units in private sector ownership for industrial and other 
      purposes. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, rely on 
      large-sale plants capable of producing large volumes of water. Small 
      plants with an estimated production of 33 mcm exist in Egypt, Iraq, 
      Jordan, and the Syrian Arab Republic.
      <P>
      <P>Existing waste water treatment facilities in many of the ESCWA member 
      countries face difficulties in handling the ever increasing volumes of 
      waste water generated by increased water consumption and urbanization. 
      Waste water discharged from major urban centers is polluting shallow 
      alluvial aquifers and the coastline, as well as causing urban water tables 
      to rise. The main emphasis has been simply to dispose of waste water 
      rather than to treat and reuse it, due to the extensive capital investment 
      required for water treatment systems. Planning for full utilization of 
      treated effluent remains in the early stages, and the regional treatment 
      capacity is sufficient to handle only 40 percent of the domestic waste 
      water generated. However, reuse of renovated waste water is being done in 
      varying degrees for urban landscaping and irrigation. The total volume of 
      reused renovated waste water and drainage water in the region is estimated 
      at about 5.5 bcm, which is far less than the treated and untreated volume 
      usually available from domestic water consumption. Reuse of treated 
      effluent is currently estimated at 60 mcm in Egypt, 
      <P>52 mcm in Jordan, and 50 mcm in the Syrian Arab Republic. Approximately 
      4.8 bcm of drainage water is being used for irrigation in Egypt. The use 
      of waste water ranges from 217 mcm in Saudi Arabia to 9.1 mcm in Yemen. 
      The ratio of reuse to domestic and industrial water requirements range 
      from 27.7 to 30 percent. In the region as a whole, renovated waste water 
      meets a small fraction of water demand. Water resources estimates, based 
      on various hydrological and hydrogeological investigations carried out in 
      the region, are given in the attached table.

      <P>The quality of drinking water and sanitation services in most of the 
      ESCWA member countries has improved over the last 10 years, with the 
      exception of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Progress has been made in achieving 
      targets established for most urban areas. However, rural communities in 
      the ESCWA region are still inadequately serviced in terms of safe drinking 
      water, sanitation facilities and easy accessibility. The United Nations 
      economic sanctions on Iraq have had an adverse impact on water supply and 
      sanitation facilities. Availability of safe drinking water and sanitation 
      is also a major problem in Gaza. The armed conflict in Yemen had a 
      detrimental impact on water supplies and sanitation facilities. This 
      situation will be further aggravated by the expected increase in 
      urbanization to nearly 75 percent by the year 2025, which will exert 
      greater pressure on water supply and sanitation facilities. 
      <P>
      <P>Imbalances between increasing water demand and existing limited water 
      resources are being experienced by most of the ESCWA member countries. 
      During the last decade, water demand in all sectors has increased 
      dramatically as a result of high population growth, improvement of living 
      standards, and efforts to achieve self sufficiency in food and industrial 
      production. Currently, agriculture is the primary water consumer. 
      Industrial water demand varies in the countries of the region, but it is 
      roughly equivalent to domestic water requirements. Drainage and renovated 
      waste water partially meets irrigation requirements in Egypt, Jordan, and 
      the Syrian Arab Republic. Domestic and industrial water requirements for 
      most GCC countries are met through desalination and a limited amount of 
      groundwater from both shallow and deep aquifers. Yemen relies solely on 
      groundwater resources for all sectors. In all GCC countries and Yemen, 
      agricultural requirements are met through extraction of water from shallow 
      alluvial aquifers located in the costal strips and inland basins, and from 
      deep aquifers covering most of the Arabian Peninsula. In Saudi Arabia, 
      rapid expansion of agricultural activities during the last two decades has 
      resulted in substantial increases in water demand, leading to extensive 
      mining of deep aquifers. Likewise, agricultural water demand has sharply 
      increased in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, where 
      groundwater reserves are being mined. This agricultural development is a 
      direct result of government policies encouraging self-sufficiency in food 
      production. Government incentives and subsidies have made it possible for 
      large areas to be cultivated, placing a great strain on existing 
      groundwater resources. Total water demand for agricultural, industrial, 
      and domestic purpose in the ESCWA region reached 139 bcm in 1990, with the 
      major consumers being Egypt, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic. Water 
      supply requirements are expected to reach 179.4 bcm by the end of the 
      century, and 244.2 bcm by the year 2025, as shown in the table below. 
      Agriculture, followed by industry, account for most of the water consumed.

      <P>Water requirements for the agricultural sector accounts for most of the 
      water used in the ESCWA region as a whole, with demand estimated at 117.8 
      bcm in 1990, with a combined demand of 98.2 bcm for the group of countries 
      that include Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
      the West Bank and Gaza, and 19.6 bcm for the group of countries including 
      Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and 
      Yemen. In 1990, the percentage of agricultural demand ranged from 62 to 90 
      percent of the total water demand in the northern ESCWA region, while in 
      the south it ranged from 21 to 93 percent. Agricultural water demand in 
      the ESCWA region is projected to reach 150.4 bcm and 187.5 bcm in the 
      years 2000 and 2025, as shown in the previous table. Industrial activities 
      in most of the ESCWA member countries have also contributed to an increase 
      in total water requirements, although not as dramatically as the 
      agricultural sector. Industrial water demand reached 10.5 bcm in 1990 in 
      Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and West Bank and Gaza, and 
      only 0.3 bcm in the GCC countries and Yemen. The percentage of industrial 
      water demand ranged from 0.4 to 11.3 percent, with lower percentages 
      reported for the GCC countries. Countries with relatively well established 
      industrial infrastructures include Egypt, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab 
      Republic. The industrial sector is still fairly limited in the southern 
      region. Industrial demand is projected to reach 14.6 bcm and 25.6 bcm in 
      the years 2000 and 2025 respectively, with the highest demand in Egypt, 
      Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic. Industrial production in most of the 
      ESCWA countries is geared towards consumer goods and petroleum refinement. 
      Many industries in the region, especially in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi 
      Arabia, and the Syrian Arab Republic, rely on raw materials derived from 
      agricultural products. Most industrial activities are confined close to 
      major urban centers, requiring competition with the domestic sector to 
      satisfy water requirements. In urban areas with concentrated industrial 
      activities, this sector represents the major water consumer in relation to 
      domestic requirements. In most of the GCC countries, field development and 
      petrochemical industries are considered to be water-use intensive. 
      Industries in Egypt and Iraq utilize surface water from major rivers, 
      while the remaining ESCWA member countries rely on groundwater 
      supplemented with surface water, desalination, and a limited amount of 
      recycled water. Domestic water requirements represent only a small 
      fraction of the total water requirements in the ESCWA member countries. In 
      1990, domestic requirements were estimated at 10.5 bcm, which is expected 
      to reach 14.4 and 31.1 bcm in the years 2000 and 2025 respectively , as a 
      result of increased population growth and improved living standards. 
      Domestic demand has been estimated at 8.7 bcm for countries with large 
      populations such as Egypt, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Saudi 
      Arabia, which represents 4.7 to 34 percent of the total water demand. In 
      comparison, domestic demand for the remaining countries was estimated at 
      1.7 bcm, accounting for 5.8 to 77 percent of the total demand, as shown in 
      the following table.

    <TD>(Cont.) 
      <P>Based on current trends and projections, shortages are expected to 
      increase as a result of increased demand and limited renewable supplies in 
      most ESCWA countries. Current water resources such as perennial surface 
      water, renewable groundwater, desalination, and reclaimed waste water are 
      insufficient to meet expected water demand. Thus, in order to offset the 
      imbalance between supply and expected demand, mining of groundwater, 
      especially from the deep aquifers, may be required to meet agricultural 
      and other demands. Expected domestic and industrial demand increases in 
      the next 30 years may also require the construction of additional 
      desalination and treatment plants to produce water and treat waste water, 
      for most countries in the region, especially the GCC countries, unless 
      strict integrated management approaches, including water conservation 
      measures and effective management schemes, are implemented and good 
      quality groundwater is used solely for domestic and industrial use. If 
      present domestic consumption patterns continue unaltered, most countries 
      of the ESCWA region will be required to allocate financial resources to 
      the construction of hydraulic structures, distribution systems, and the 
      construction of new desalination plants and support facilities with 
      capacities capable of handling increased demand. A large number of waste 
      treatment plants will also be required to handle the resulting wastes. 
      This huge investment may result in a considerable economic strain, 
      especially in those countries with limited financial resources. However, 
      proper planning and integrated development, and management of water 
      resources, along with just allocation of shared water resources through 
      equitable agreements, will contribute significantly towards alleviating 
      water deficits. Many countries of the region have already taken steps 
      towards the implementation of management programmes, including proper 
      planning and conservation measures, to promote reduced water consumption 
      and optimal allocation of water resources. 
      <P>
      <P>As far as the implementation of the objectives of various programme 
      areas outlined in chapter 18 of Agenda 21, each ESCWA country has its 
      priority depending on the national situation of its water supply/demand 
      and future forecast. Along this line, the ESCWA secretariat, in addition 
      to rendering technical assistance for capacity building in the area of 
      water management, undertook implementation of the following activities 
      during 1995-1996: report on the introduction of appropriate mechanisms to 
      promote regional cooperation in the water sector; implementation of a 
      field project to investigate the shared basalt aquifers in the Syrian Arab 
      Republic and Jordan; assessment of water resources quality in the ESCWA 
      region; and convened an expert group meeting on the implementation of 
      chapter 18 of Agenda 21 for integrated water management in the region. 
      Furthermore, the secretariat organized two training courses: (i) for using 
      remote sensing data and GIS techniques in hydrology and hydrogeology, and 
      (ii) an ad hoc expert group meeting on water legislation.

      <P>A qualitative evaluation of the implementation of Agenda 21 in the 
      ESCWA region indicates progress in some areas. However, the physical state 
      of the regional environment provides a negative picture. Against the 
      background of deteriorating environmental conditions one would have 
      expected increased international financial flows to the region. However, 
      the total ODA percentage from OECD to Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab 
      Republic, Jordan, Yemen, and Tunisia registered a sharp decline from 16.3 
      percent for 1983-1984 to only 8.7 percent for 1993-1994 (source: OECD, 
      Creditors Reporting System, 1995). The importance of innovative financing 
      was mentioned in para 33.16 of Agenda 21, in which it is also mentioned 
      that new ways of generating new public and private sources should be 
      explored. Such innovative financing mechanisms may include debt-for-nature 
      swaps for the highly indebted countries of the region (Egypt, Jordan, and 
      Yemen). Common interests and complementary needs of industrial and 
      developed countries must provide the basic rationale for financing Agenda 
      21. In such spirit, cooperation must include not only ODA, but also trade, 
      debt management, private investment and capital flows, private sector 
      development, access to technology, and the strengthening of civil society 
      as a whole. 
      <P>
      <P>In terms of sectoral components of sustainable development in the Arab 
      region as a whole, each country has its own path based on its specific 
      problems and constraints; hence, there is no blue print for regional 
      sustainable development at the macro level. The tentative orders of 
      magnitude of financial requirements and investment costs to promote a more 
      environmentally sustainable development are given in the table below for a 
      selected number of Arab countries. These figures are based on World Bank 
      estimates. As can be seen, the investment requirements for sound 
      environment management range between $58 and $78 billion over the next ten 
      years. The estimate does not include investment in energy and water 
      efficiency improvements.

      <P>The Arab countries, as other developing countries, have expressed 
      concern in various international fora at the lack of environmentally sound 
      technology transfers (ESTs) on a concessional basis. Chapter 34 of Agenda 
      21 called for new policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the 
      transfer of ESTs along with supportive measures and capacity building. The 
      transfer of technology for development to the developing countries, as 
      envisaged in Agenda 21 and other international agreements, however, faces 
      a series of challenges under the intellectual property rights provision of 
      the GATT agreement. It is for the same reason that representatives of 
      developing countries have been highlighting this concern in various 
      sessions of the Commission on Sustainable Development and emphasizing the 
      importance of access to ESTs in the public domain as well as facilitating 
      transfer of ESTs through innovative legislative and market mechanisms. 
      <P>
      <P>The ESCWA countries lack the means to use economic instruments and 
      other non-regulatory measures as a flexible and efficient means for 
      promoting sustainability, to ensure compatibility between environmental 
      and technological policies. The measures are intended to provide 
      incentives for industry to meet environmental standards in the most 
      cost-efficient way, and to stimulate the transfer, adaptation and 
      development of environmentally sound technologies and sustainable 
      practices. As existing technology policies in the region do not provide 
      strong enough inducements for the widespread development and use of ESTs, 
      a new policy mix consisting of and leading to regulatory instruments, 
      economic and fiscal measures, information dissemination, human resources 
      development, the establishment of national technical promotion 
      institutions, and research and development capacities, is in order. 
      However, the precise approach will depend on national circumstances.

      <P>The Arab Ministerial Declaration on Environment and Development 
      (initiated by ESCWA in cooperation with the League of Arab States/Council 
      of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment - CAMRE) and the 
      Regional Action Programme for Sustainable Development (RAPSD) adopted by 
      CAMRE, have provided added impetus for Arab regional cooperation in the 
      implementation of Agenda 21. The Ministerial Declaration took into 
      consideration the environmental and socio-economic conditions of the 
      entire region. This, and the need for cooperation in the follow-up of 
      global initiatives, namely Agenda 21 of UNCED, was also reflected. The 
      Declaration covers all policy directions, reaffirms commitments of all 
      Arab countries to promote sustainable development, and resolves to 
      implement national plans dealing with natural resources, environment and 
      sustainable development, taking into consideration national priorities. 
      <P>
      <P>The RAPSD provides a blueprint for action to promote sustainable 
      development in the Arab region. It is also a timely response to the major 
      sustainable development issues identified in the annual meetings of the 
      CAMRE, which, through the JCEDAR, sets out a concrete course of national 
      action for the Arab region. It envisages the achievement of 141 tangible 
      results through 13 priority programmes in line with regional concerns 
      ranging from desertification, water resources management, to ESTs. The 
      actions called for in the RAPSD for the implementation of Agenda 21 may be 
      required at several levels: 
      <P>
      <P>- Regional: to deal with sub-regional and regional issues of a 
      transboundary nature and common interest, and activities of capacity 
      building in the coastal area which can be efficiently and cost-effectively 
      dealt with at sub-regional/ regional levels in support of national 
      strategies, i.e. desertification, biodiversity, etc;
      <P>
      <P>- National: to deal with environmental issues which are mainly national 
      in character such as industrial pollution control, urbanization, energy 
      and transportation issues;
      <P>
      <P>- Local: for which decentralization from a national to a local level is 
      essential to manage in a cost-effective way environmental problems such as 
      water supply and sanitation, poverty alleviation and local area 
      development.
      <P>
      <P>The RAPSD envisages capacity building at national level through 
      regional inter-Arab cooperation. Further, it proposes to promote regional 
      cooperation and combating oil pollution and wastes at sea. Such 
      cooperation is promoted through the networks of national institutions 
      responsible for desertification, marine pollution, indicators, information 
      and awareness, to enable exchange of experience and knowledge through the 
      exchange of information and expertise. To
      <P>achieve this objective, ESCWA provides capacity building and technical 
      assistance to promote sustainable development, through its regional 
      advisory services and its leading coordination for the promotion of Agenda 
      21.
