<P align=center><B><FONT size=+2>An Overview of North American Wetlands 
</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><I><FONT size=+1>By Kenneth W. Cox. North American Wetlands 
Conservation Council (Canada), and Gilberto Cintrón, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, United States of America </FONT></I></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Extent of North American Wetlands</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>North America is the third largest continent, covering over 24 
million square kilometres; geographically extending from the Arctic Ocean to the 
warm tropics, the region spans more than 60° of latitude. Canada and the United 
States occupy much of north central North America, while Mexico extends to its 
southernmost limit. All three countries are Contracting Parties to the Ramsar 
Convention. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The North American continent contains a large percentage of all 
the world's wetlands. These range in size from small, seasonal wetlands (less 
than a hectare) to vast wetlands spanning immense portions of the landscape. 
Canada holds about 24% of the world's wetlands, encompassing over 127 million 
hectares. This is approximately 14% of the entire landscape and about three 
times the wetland area found in the United States, excluding Alaska. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Wetlands covered 89 million hectares in the United States 
(excluding Alaska) at the time of the nation's settlement. Today, only 43 
million hectares (47%) of the original wetland area remain. In stark contrast, 
an estimated 81 million hectares of Alaskan wetlands remain mostly undisturbed. 
In Mexico, wetlands occupy over 2 million hectares, almost two-thirds of these 
occur on tropical coastlines. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The region has 54 Ramsar sites (Canada 33, United States of 
America 15 and Mexico 6), amounting to only 7% of Ramsar sites world-wide. 
However, collectively they cover over 15 million hectares accounting for almost 
28% of the total area of Ramsar wetlands, a reflection of the vast size of some 
of the North American sites.</FONT></P>
<HR color=#000080 SIZE=1 width="80%">

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Wetland Diversity</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The large diversity in wetland types reflects the latitudinal 
span of the North American land mass (from the Arctic to the tropics) and the 
different climatic conditions, hydrologic regimes, and numerous landscape types 
found within it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Extensive Arctic wetlands are found in northern and western 
Alaska. Most notable are the moist tundra wetlands of the North Slope Coastal 
Plain, used by Barren Ground Caribou <I>Rangifer arcticus</I> for calving and 
feeding. In Canada, the Arctic wetlands include the sedge meadows of the 
Athabasca Delta which provide grazing for the world's largest ranging herd of 
Bison <I>Bison bison</I>, and a rich diversity of other mammals such as Grey 
Wolf <I>Canis lupus</I> and Lynx <I>Lynx canadensis</I>. In spring and autumn 
the delta supports over a million birds including many species of ducks, geese 
and the threatened Whooping Crane <I>Grus americana</I> (IUCN Red List, 1994). 
Other extensive wetlands include the Mackenzie and Yukon river deltas as well as 
the massive Hudson and James Bay lowlands in the eastern central portion of 
Canada.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Vast portions of the boreal life zone of North America are 
dominated by peatlands (bogs and fens). Some 110-130 million hectares of 
peatlands are found in Canada alone, giving this country the largest peat 
resources in the world. The bogs and fens of the Boreal region provide seasonal 
habitat for large mammals, including Woodland Caribou <I>Rangifer caribou</I> 
and Moose <I>Alces americana</I>, and many other mammals such as Beaver 
<I>Castor canadensis</I> and Muskrat <I>Ondatra zibethicus</I>. The largest 
concentration of Canadian wetlands are boreal forested peatlands found in the 
provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, where it is estimated that 22.5 million 
hectares and 29.2 million hectares of wetlands, respectively, remain. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The wetlands of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Basin 
consist of bogs, fens, marshes, and forested swamps that are important habitats 
for migratory waterfowl. The Great Lakes coastal marshes are connected to the 
largest reservoir of fresh water on earth (the five lakes have a coastline which 
exceeds 15,100km and cover an area of 246,568km2). Several wetlands along the 
Great Lakes in southern Ontario are designated as Ramsar sites. These wetlands 
provide spawning ground for important freshwater fish species such as 
Muskellunge <I>Esox masquinongy</I>, Largemouth Bass <I>Micropertus 
salmoides</I>, Yellow Perch <I>Perca flavescens</I>, and Pumpkinseed <I>Lepomus 
gibbosus</I>. Six species of turtle and several amphibian species are dependent 
on these habitats. Many thousands of migratory birds, including several duck 
species, and the Canada Goose <I>Branta canadensis</I> use these areas for 
breeding. Aside from their rich animal and plant diversity, the wetlands also 
provide many natural products to one of the most populated regions in 
Canada.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, 
and the American states of Minnesota, and North and South Dakota, encompass a 
vast area (780,000km2) where numerous freshwater marshes occupy depressions 
formed by Pleistocene glaciers. This Prairie Potholes region is the single most 
important breeding habitat for most North American ducks: approximately 60% of 
the continent's ducks are raised here, as well as an unknown, but large, 
proportion of other prairie-dwelling marsh and aquatic birds. The Prairie 
Potholes region is also a major world producer of cereal grains presenting great 
challenges to the conservation of these wetlands.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Extensive areas of coastal and estuarine wetlands occur in the 
North American Region stretching from Atlantic Canada, throughout the entire 
length of Atlantic U.S. and into coastal lagoons of Mexico's east coast. While 
not as abundant, Pacific shorelines contain coastal lagoons and river delta 
wetlands. On Canada's east coast the high tidal amplitudes (to 13m) of the Bay 
of Fundy have created extensive areas of tidal saltmarsh and intertidal flats 
that are critically important to international populations of shorebirds. More 
than 80% of the world population (over 3 million birds) of the Semi-palmated 
Sandpiper <I>Calidris pusilla </I>forage on the tidal mudflats each autumn in 
preparation for their non-stop flight to Suriname, South America. Four areas of 
the upper Bay of Fundy have been designated as Ramsar sites. Similarly, the 
Alaksen Ramsar site on the Fraser River Delta on Canada's west coast supports 
internationally important shorebird populations in the Pacific 
flyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The extensive coastal plain and abundant rainfall of the 
southeastern United States supports a complex of large and heterogeneous 
wetlands that include the Great Dismal Swamp, the Pocosins, and Okeefenokee 
Swamp. The Great Dismal Swamp covers 850km2 near the Norfolk-Newport 
News-Virginia Beach urban sprawl. Originally it covered more than 2,000km2; but 
its area was reduced by draining, logging and fire. Former owners donated 250km2 
to the U.S. Government to establish a national wildlife refuge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The Pocosins are found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain from 
Virginia to northern Florida; these are wetlands dominated by evergreen shrubs 
such as <I>Cyrilla racemiflora</I>, <I>Magnolia virginiana</I>, <I>Persea 
borbonia</I>, <I>Ilex glabra</I>, <I>Myrica heterophylla</I>, <I>Smilax 
laurifolia</I> and pine <I>Pinus serotina</I>. In North Carolina the Pocosins 
cover 3,700km2. Okeefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia and northeastern 
Florida is a mosaic of wetlands encompassing 1,750km2. Much of this swamp is now 
part of the Okeefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1970. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The southern tip of Florida contains three major wetland types 
in a 34,000km2 wetland complex: the Everglades, Big Cypress Swamp, and numerous 
coastal mangroves and glades. Water flows from Lake Okeechobee to the sea as a 
thin sheet (often centimetres in depth), forming an 80km wide 'sea of grass' 
dominated by <I>Cladium jamaicense</I> (actually a sedge).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Extensive marshes, swamps and shallow coastal lakes exceed 
36,000km2 within the Mississippi River Delta. This is a staging and resting area 
for one of the most important waterfowl flyways in North America. The delta 
provides habitat for geese, ducks, and American Coot <I>Fulica americana</I> and 
hundreds of thousands of shorebirds that overwinter or pass through on their way 
to their wintering grounds in Latin America. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Coastal estuarine wetlands are found along the Atlantic, 
Pacific, Alaskan and Gulf coasts. Saltmarshes are particularly abundant along 
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Mangrove swamps, dominated by halophytic shrubs or 
trees, are found in southern Florida.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>There are more than 125 coastal lagoons along Mexico's Atlantic 
and Pacific shorelines, encompassing a total surface area of about 12,400km2. 
Mangroves cover more than 6,500km2, one of the largest areas of mangrove 
coverage among tropical countries. The 2,970km east coast of Mexico contains 
some of the largest undisturbed wetland complexes in the Western Hemisphere. 
Among these are the Laguna Madre, Tampico lagoons and marshes, Laguna Tamiahua, 
Alvarado lagoons, Tabasco lagoon and marshes and the coastal lagoons of Campeche 
and Yucatán. The Pacific Coast of Mexico also contains important wintering areas 
for North American waterfowl.</FONT></P>
<HR color=#000080 SIZE=1 width="80%">

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Threats to North American Wetlands</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Historically, conversion of wetlands for agricultural use 
(drainage) has been the major factor behind wetland decline in Canada, Mexico 
and the United States. In urban areas filling has accounted for significant 
wetland losses. Construction of dams, canals, waterways, levees and flood 
control structures has had serious downstream effects in many places. For 
example, along the coast of Louisiana, in the United States, more than 100km2 of 
wetlands are lost annually due to subsidence and erosion as a result of water 
diversions and sediment deprivation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>In Canada, over one-seventh of the wetland area that existed 
before European settlement has been converted for other uses. In the United 
States (excluding Alaska) it is likely that over 50% of the original wetland 
area has been lost while Mexico's loss is estimated at approximately 
35%.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Public awareness and wetland conservation efforts have 
increased in recent years and new laws stimulating wetland programmes have had 
positive influences on wetland management. However, it is apparent that the 
cumulative impact of many small individual actions (no single one of which is 
alarming) is becoming a major threat to the integrity of wetland landscapes. 
Unfortunately, no methodology for cumulative impact assessment is universally 
accepted by scientists and wetland managers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (signed in 1986) 
is an innovative approach between Canada and the United States to protect and 
improve waterfowl habitats on a continental scale. In 1994 this plan was revised 
and Mexico joined the United States and Canada as a signatory. As of April 1995 
nearly 810,000ha of wetland habitats have been protected and over a million 
hectares have been restored or enhanced in North America as a result of the 
implementation of this plan.</FONT></P>
<HR color=#000080 SIZE=1 width="80%">

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Case Studies of North American Wetlands</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The biodiversity of wetland ecosystems in North America is 
illustrated by the four case studies described in this chapter: Old Crow Flats, 
Canada; Quill Lakes, Canada; Ría Lagartos, Mexico; and Caddo Lake, United 
States.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Arctic wetlands include innumerable shallow lakes and ponds 
that dot the tundra and the marshes during the summer, and shallow-water 
wetlands along the coasts and in low-lying areas. Old Crow Flats (Case Study 1) 
is an extensive wetland complex covering the Old Crow River Basin and the 
Bluefish River Basin in northern Yukon. Over 2,000 wetlands dot the landscape. 
Low average annual precipitation and average annual daily temperature make this 
wetland complex unique.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Quill Lakes (Case Study 2) is an exceptionally diverse area 
that includes two saline lakes, several freshwater marshes, native prairie 
habitat, and some of the best pothole areas in the Province of Saskatchewan. 
Every year this area is used by nearly one million birds; it provides excellent 
habitat for waterfowl as well as a seasonal home for more than 150,000 
shorebirds.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>In Mexico, much of the Yucatán Peninsula is a calcareous plain 
with subterranean water courses that surface near the coast and give rise to a 
series of coastal lagoons and marshes. This chain of saline lagoons and small 
estuaries along the north shore of the peninsula supports a large breeding 
population of Caribbean Flamingos <I>Phoenicopterus ruber</I>. Ría Lagartos 
(Case Study 3) is the largest wetland complex on the east coast of the Yucatán 
Peninsula, containing two large shallow sea bays fringed by extensive mangrove 
swamps, studded with numerous mangrove covered islands. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The large shallow wetland which once covered the northern parts 
of the Mississippi River Basin has long since been drained for agriculture and 
the basin's most important wetlands are now the lowland floodplains of rivers 
and streams. Caddo Lake and its associated wetlands (Case Study 4), is one 
example, hosting wetland forest communities with such species as willow 
<I>Salix</I> spp., aspen <I>Populus</I> spp., ash <I>Fraxinus</I> spp., elm 
<I>Ulmus</I> spp., and hickory <I>Carya</I> spp., in addition to cypress and 
aquatic communities supporting a range of emergent and submerged aquatic plants. 
The wetlands of this basin serve as the most important wintering area for ducks 
and geese in the whole of the central part of the continent and provide staging 
and resting areas on the most important waterbird flyway in North America.

<P align=center><I><FONT size=+1>By Jim Hawkings, Canadian Wildlife Service, 
Canada</FONT></I></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Major Features of the Wetland</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Old Crow Flats, located in the extreme northern Yukon 
Territory, is a lacustrine plain pocked by over 2,000 wetlands. The wetlands 
occur in two sub-areas, the Old Crow River Basin, and the Bluefish River Basin. 
Located north of the community of Old Crow, the Old Crow River Basin is the 
largest, covering 550,000ha, 26% of which is wetland (open water, emergent 
vegetation, or floating mats). The Bluefish Basin lies south of Old Crow and 
covers 83,000ha, 21% of which is wetland. The lakes in the Old Crow Flats vary 
in size from 0.5 to 4,700ha and have an average depth of 1 to 1.5m and a maximum 
depth of about 4m. The basin is composed of lacustrine clays deposited during 
the Quaternary when the basin was flooded by an enormous lake, and overlain by 
varying depths of organic material which have accumulated since this glacial 
lake drained about 12,000 years ago. Over the years, streams in the basin have 
cut deep into the sediments, leaving most of the lakes perched well above the 
highest spring flood level. The abundant shallow water, 24 hour daylight, and 
warm summer temperatures make the present lakes exceptionally productive for 
this latitude. </FONT></P>
<P><IMG align=right alt="bio146.jpg (24123 bytes)" height=296 hspace=10 
src="Geo-2-085_files/bio146.jpe" width=268><B><FONT size=-1>This image, covering 
120km by 120km, was derived from data collected by the Thematic Mapper sensor on 
the Landsat 5 satellite on 30 June 1990. The Old Crow River Basin covers the 
upper half, and the Bluefish Basin is the lower right. In this false-colour 
infrared enhancement, clear water appears as black and turbid water as shades of 
blue. Note that the large lakes are generally oriented at right angles to the 
prevailing northeast winds. Dark green tones indicate various types of open 
canopy spruce forests. The red tones indicate broad-leaved deciduous plants, 
principally willow, dwarf birch, and various ericacious shrubs. The brightest 
white and light grey tones indicate barren or sparsely vegetated terrain on 
mountains surrounding the basins as well as seasonally flooded gravel bars along 
the rivers. The small community of Old Crow is the only human cultural feature 
visible. Its airstrip and gravel streets appear as a bright barren area at the 
confluence of the Porcupine River (draining northeast to southwest across the 
lower half of the image) and the Old Crow River (meandering northwest to 
southeast). (<I>Photo: J. Hawkings)</I></FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The Old Crow Flats constitutes its own ecoregion within the 
Taiga Cordillera ecozone of Canada. The mean annual precipitation is 200mm, and 
mean annual daily temperature is -10°C, with July mean daily temperature 15°C 
and January mean daily temperature -35°C. This makes it one of the warmest 
locations in the Yukon in summer and one of the coldest in the winter. The 
entire area is underlain by permafrost, and growth and decay of ground ice 
constantly modify the landscape. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The lakes are formed and modified by the combined action of 
permafrost and the prevailing winds. They appear to go through cycles of 
draining and refilling, with flushes of productivity at several stages, but the 
dynamics of this process are not completely understood. Although the lakes are 
constantly changing in depth and area, this is a gradual process compared to the 
year to year fluctuations in more temperate or tropical wetlands or in other 
northern areas subject to seasonal flooding. This makes the Flats a predictable 
and attractive destination for waterfowl.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Fauna and Flora of Old Crow Flats</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Many of the lakes have luxuriant beds of submergent plants such 
as pondweeds <I>Potamogeton</I> spp., burreeds <I>Sparganium</I> spp., and even 
duckweed <I>Lemna</I> spp. The terrestrial vegetation is a mixture of shrubs 
such as willow <I>Salix</I> spp., Dwarf Birch <I>Betula glandulosa</I>, Labrador 
Tea <I>Ledum decumbens</I>, and lowbush Cranberry <I>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</I>, 
sparse White Spruce<I> Picea glauca</I> and Black Spruce <I>P. mariana</I> 
forest with shrub or lichen understorey, and subarctic tundra dominated by 
Cottongrass <I>Eriophorum vaginatum</I> or <I>Sphagnum</I> mosses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>More than 100 bird species have been recorded on the Flats, 
including at least 21 species of waterfowl. The area is important as a breeding 
and moulting ground to some 500,000 waterfowl including ducks (see Box 10), 
swans, geese, three species of loon <I>Gavia</I> spp. and a variety of other 
waterbirds. Banding studies have shown these birds to be associated with all 
four North American Flyways. Waterfowl are more concentrated here than at other 
locations in the north. For example, densities of ducks on the Flats are usually 
in the vicinity of 80 ducks per square kilometer, two to three times higher than 
in any of the 11 primary waterfowl breeding grounds surveyed annually in Alaska 
by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Some of these birds breed and moult on the 
Flats, while others such as Barrow's Goldeneye <I>Bucephala islandica</I> do not 
breed there but come in midsummer from further south to undergo their annual 
moult.</FONT></P>

and 9 per hectare in fall, a total population of 330,000 to 650,000. Moose 
<I>Alces americana</I> are also present and, in habitats such as drained lake

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Traditional Utilization and Management of the Area 
</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The waterfowl, muskrats, and other wildlife of the Flats as 
well as caribou and salmon are of great importance to the native people of the 
community of Old Crow, located just south of the Flats at the confluence of the 
Old Crow and Porcupine rivers. These people are descendants of the first human 
inhabitants of the area some 20,000 years ago, and are known as the Vuntut 
Gwitchin, which means 'people of the lakes'.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>In 1982 Old Crow Flats was designated a Ramsar site. Under the 
terms of the Vuntut Gwitchin Final Agreement proclaimed by the Canadian 
Government in February 1995, the northern portion of the Old Crow Flats becomes 
Vuntut National Park. Of the remainder, part is Settlement Land belonging to the 
Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, and the rest remains federal government land. 
Despite these three different land tenures, the land claims agreement designates 
the entire area as Old Crow Flats Special Management Area and stipulates that it 
be managed to maintain the integrity of the area as one ecological unit, with 
the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitats, and the protection of 
the current and traditional use of the area by the Vuntut Gwitchin as guiding 
principles. Using these principles, a management plan will be prepared jointly 
by government and the Vuntut Gwitchin which incorporates the management plan for 
the Vuntut National Park.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Given the remote wilderness location, pristine conditions, and 
the strong conservation regime now in place for the Old Crow Flats, its future 
as a wetland of international importance seems politically assured. One 
potential threat is global climate change. Old Crow residents seem to feel that 
lake levels have been dropping, and are concerned that the Flats are 'drying up' 
from the warmer temperatures and earlier springs of recent years.</FONT><A

<P><FONT size=+0>The Quill Lakes contains three distinct wetlands (Big Quill, 
Middle Quill and Little Quill lakes) and numerous small marshes within a mixed 
grassland ecosystem. The lakes are located approximately 120km north of Regina, 
Saskatchewan, the site of the 1987 Ramsar Convention Conference. The area, 
encompassing over 40,000ha, includes the largest saline lake in Canada, a 
freshwater lake, several marshes, mixed-grass prairie and aspen parkland. 
Migratory waterfowl breed, feed and roost on large open marshes adjacent to the 
lakes as well as on the lakes themselves. Wind action and annual fluctuation in 
water levels on these shallow lakes create large expanses of fresh mudflats 
(similar to tide action) used by shorebirds for feeding. The region is 
considered one of North America's most critical inland waterbodies for up to one 
million birds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=+0>Selected as a Ramsar site in 1987, Quill Lakes was the first 
implementation site for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan in Canada. 
As a 'first-step' initiative, nearly 7,000ha were developed or enhanced for 
waterfowl and other wildlife. Designation as a premier marsh under the 
Provincial Heritage Marsh Program involved intensified management of existing 
Ducks Unlimited Canada projects on tributary drainage.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Threats and Management Solutions</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The Quill Lakes region is classified as a saline lowland range. 
Natural fluctuation in water levels and potential long-term decline in water 
level on the lakes pose the largest threat. Up until recent years, cattle grazed 
in many upland areas associated with the lakes, and had access to shorelines, 
beaches and mudflats which resulted in the destruction of critical habitat for 
wildlife. Uneven cattle distribution contributed to increased grazing pressure 
near water sources, and the saline environment appeared to be responsible for 
patchy cover in several locations. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>To address these concerns, waterfowl management plans were 
developed to guide conservation partners in restoring and protecting areas. The 
plans feature sound land-use initiatives that contribute to soil, water and 
wildlife conservation. A shorebird habitat management plan is in the final 
stages of preparation. By working with local landowners, who are primarily 
cattle producers, the Saskatchewan Wetland Conservation Corporation and its 
partners ensure that producers' needs are taken into consideration at the 
planning and implementation stage, and that the area is restored and enhanced in 
a mutually beneficial manner for both wildlife and cattle producers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>It is recognized that the support and participation of local 
landowners and farmers is crucial to the success of the project. Many of the 
solutions to prairie soil conservation problems also apply to increasing 
waterfowl populations. To be acceptable, solutions must be sound from a 
conservation perspective, and economically fair to landowners and producers in 
the Quill Lakes area.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Elements of the waterfowl management plan include a Waterfowl 
Crop Damage Control Program, the acquisition of 12,141ha of land around the 
Quill Lakes and the construction of fences to reduce conflict between cattle and 
nesting birds, particularly on the beaches of Big Quill Lake where 19% of the 
provincial population and 5% of the world's Piping Plover population nest. 
Managed grazing systems, incorporating rest-rotational and deferred grazing 
applications, are being implemented by local landowners to ensure that paddocks 
within the pastures will not be grazed until the nesting season is over. At 
least one paddock per pasture will not be grazed each year.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Mutual Benefits</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Managing pastures will benefit producers by improving range 
conditions and vegetative cover thus ensuring a sustainable supply of forage for 
cattle. Increased vegetation will benefit wildlife by improving nesting habitat 
for grassland nesting birds. The Quill Lakes project will also provide a unique 
economic opportunity for local individuals to capitalize on developing and 
marketing products which cater to segments of the burgeoning eco-tourism 
industry. Nature tourism is one of North America's fastest growing industries 
and holds a great deal of potential for increased economic development activity 
in rural Saskatchewan in addition to the economic impact of waterfowl hunting in 
many communities.</FONT><A name=cs3></A></P>

<P><FONT size=+0>The Ría Lagartos estuary is located 270km from Mérida, the 
capital of the province on the northeast coast of the state of Yucatán. It has a 
surface area of 55,350ha and extends along 74km of coastline. The north border 
is formed by a sand bar island with three connections to the sea. The system is 
composed of three water bodies differing in length from 0.25 to 3.5km. The 
estuary extends over an area of 9,467ha and the depth varies from 0.5 to 3m. The 
climate varies from the very dry arid to the very dry warm-humid and the area is 
located in the path of Caribbean hurricanes. The whole area is a relatively flat 
land supporting an interesting range of plants and animals associated with 
coastal ecosystems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The area is also of archaeological interest: during the Maya 
civilization this area, previously part of the Chikinchel province, controlled 
the production of salt for the entire nation. Salt production is still an 
important source of income along with fisheries for the 1,500 families in the 
four villages nearby. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Main Threats to the Area</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The main natural threat confronting both the reserve and the 
local population is the risk of flooding through waves and surge tides produced 
by hurricanes and storms in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988, hurricane Gilberto 
broke the sand bar and the damage inflicted on the area prompted the Mexican 
Government to request that the Ría Lagartos be included on the Montreux Record. 
Although sites are usually placed on the Record because of undesirable 
ecological changes resulting from human rather than natural causes, this request 
was granted. In 1993 the Mexican Government requested that the site be retained 
on the Montreux Record because of a number of new activities in the area which 
threatened the integrity of the ecosystem including salt extraction and illegal 
fishing and farming. A management plan has been prepared and with partial 
funding from the Global Environment Facility it is beginning to be implemented. 
It is hoped that this will eventually lead to the removal of Ría Lagartos from 
the Montreux Record.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=+0>Baldcypress swamp/ flooded hardwood forest occurs throughout 
the Caddo Lake watershed. The vegetation is dominated by the Southern 
Baldcypress <I>Taxodium distichum, </I>a large, broad-based (buttressed) 
coniferous tree which is considered a pioneer species of southern wetlands. The 
trees are slow growing, but once they establish themselves in monocultural 
stands of even-aged cohorts, they are able to occupy permanently flooded areas. 
Trees of 250 to 350 years of age are not uncommon in the Caddo Lake ecosystem 
and the reported longevity elsewhere of this species can exceed a thousand 
years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Although Baldcypress dominates the swamps, several other major 
species are associated with it such as Water Oak <I>Quercus nigra</I>, Willow 
Oak <I>Q. phellos</I> , and Water Tupelo <I>Nyssa aquatica</I>. There is also a 
great diversity of wetland shrubs, sedges, and rushes as well as 42 species of 
floating and submerged macrophytes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Cypress swamps in general are highly productive ecosystems and 
the community at Caddo Lake represents one of the best examples of its kind in 
the state, supporting many animal species restricted to wetlands such as 
American Alligator <I>Alligator mississippiensis,</I> Alligator Snapping Turtle 
<I>Macroclemys temminckii</I>, Beaver <I>Castor canadensis</I>, Muskrat 
<I>Ondatra zibethicus</I> and Mink <I>Mustela vison</I>. The swamps are also of 
considerable importance as wintering and production areas for waterfowl 
especially Wood Duck <I>Aix sponsa</I> and Mallard <I>Anas platyrhynchos</I>, 
but including significant numbers of Northern Pintail <I>Anas acuta</I>, Gadwall 
<I>A. strepera</I>, American Wigeon <I>A. americana</I>, and Green-winged Teal 
<I>A. clypeata</I>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Mixed bottomland hardwoods occur along streams and tributaries 
and are the most extensive of the two main vegetation types. Water and Willow 
Oak are the dominant species here, but they are associated with many other tree 
species and a variety of other plants. This type of vegetation contains areas of 
old growth and virgin hardwoods and one of the largest and most remarkable 
examples of such areas is found within the 3,400ha Longhorn Army Ammunition 
Plant (LHAAP), a federally-owned facility located on the southerly shores of 
Caddo Lake. The most significant of its forested wetlands is the Harrison Bayou 
virgin/old-growth bottomland forest. This 510ha forest has been characterized as 
a model southern bottomland hardwood wetland in both structure and ecological 
function. Approximately half of the Harrison Bayou forest is virgin forest and 
the balance is naturally regenerated, old growth, bottomland mixed 
forests.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>These bottomlands are not only important areas for forest 
dwelling species such as White-tailed Deer <I>Odocoileus virginianus</I>, 
Raccoon <I>Procyon lotor</I>, Swamp Rabbit <I>Sylvilagus aquaticus</I> and 
Barred Owl <I>Strix varia</I>, but also provide habitat for resident waterfowl 
and function as an important migratory corridor for waterfowl which use the area 
for cover, resting and feeding. In addition, they serve as a haven for over 50% 
of all neotropical migrant songbirds listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service 
as occurring in North America.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>This forest community is significant when one considers that 
the US has lost approximately 50% of the wetland acreage that existed in the 
lower 48 states prior to European settlement and that between 1883 and 1991 the 
southern bottomland hardwood forest acreage decreased by 77%. The 23% that 
remains is being fragmented and has lost much of its original ecological role. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Caddo Lake and its associated wetlands are home to many species 
or plant communities which are of special concern. Globally threatened species 
include Red-cockaded Woodpecker <I>Picoides borealis</I>, Piping Plover 
<I>Charadrius melodus</I> and Alligator Snapping Turtle (IUCN Red List, 1994) 
and there are many other species which are either Federally or Texas 
listed.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Threats to the Caddo Lake Wetlands</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Cypress swamps are very fragile and are becoming increasingly 
scarce within the state as a result of any number of activities such as timber 
harvesting, channelization and other land-use activities which alter the 
hydrologic conditions in ways which preclude regeneration of the key species, 
the Southern Baldcypress. This species is unable to regenerate on a permanently 
flooded substrate and the seedlings cannot tolerate long periods of complete 
submergence; successful regeneration is believed to be dependent upon 
appropriate flooding and drying patterns . At Caddo Lake mature trees are 
surviving the current permanent inundation, but there is little regeneration 
taking place in permanently flooded areas. The alleged low regeneration rates 
elsewhere are the subject of studies by the National Biological Service and the 
Caddo Lake Institute. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>Populations of American Beaver<I> Castor canadensis,</I> and an 
introduced species of Nutria <I>Myocastor coypus</I> are regarded as potential 
risks to healthy generation and regeneration of old-growth and Baldcypress 
forest remnants and do not seem to be well controlled by predators in the area. 
Nuisance macrophytes include duckweed <I>Lemna</I> sp., Hydrilla <I>Hydrilla 
verticillata</I>, Water Hyacinth <I>Eichhornia crassipes</I>, and water lilies 
<I>Nuphar luteum</I> and <I>Nymphaea odorata</I>. There is also concern about 
elevated levels of heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, lead and selenium. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>In 1995, Texas state authorities advised against frequent 
consumption of Largemouth Bass because of the mercury levels detected in tissue 
samples of this fish. Elevated levels of fecal coliforms were found in the 
course of preliminary testing near small lakeshore communities by the Caddo Lake 
Institute 1995 monitoring activities. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>The Caddo Lake Institute's Scholars Program Awards Ceremony in 
May 1993 included the first 'State of Caddo Lake' announcement. In it Dr Jack 
McCullough compared his 1993 study findings with a similar study conducted in 
the 1980s. He recommended that additional efforts be made by appropriate 
agencies to control nutrient input into the lake because their levels appeared 
to be increasing, leading to an accelerated rate of eutrophication. He also 
urged that oil production in portions of the lake be monitored to insure minimal 
impact on the ecosystem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>His final remarks provide a fitting conclusion to this case 
study:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0>"In summary, I might say again, it is a fragile ecosystem. It 
is under stress. Efforts to alter the ecosystem through new construction 
projects - such as channelization, plans to raise the water depth or alter the 
hydraulic retention time - or any additional efforts to greatly increase 
development around the lake, should be controlled carefully, so we don't push 
this fragile system to the breaking point."</FONT></P>
