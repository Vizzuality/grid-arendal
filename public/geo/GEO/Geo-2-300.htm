      <P>Gross fixed capital formation covers investment in structures and 
      machinery and equipment. It is a channel for the diffusion of new 
      technology, especially to manufacturing industries. It represents around 
      21.0% of OECD-wide GDP, ranging from 29.8% (Korea) to 16.0% (Sweden). For 
      most countries, this ratio decreased during the 1990s. </P>
      <P>Investment in knowledge is by nature much more difficult to measure. A 
      rough indication can be gained by including public and private spending on 
      higher education, expenditure on R&amp;D and investment in software. 
      Investment in knowledge accounts for about 4.7% of OECD-wide GDP and would 
      exceed 10% if education expenditure for all levels was included in the 
      definition of investment in knowledge. </P>
      <P>Sweden, the United States, Korea and Finland are the four most 
      knowledge-based economies, as their investment in knowledge amounts to 
      5.2-6.5% of GDP. The ratio of investment in knowledge to GDP in Sweden, 
      Finland and the United States is more than two-thirds of the ratio of 
      investment in machinery and equipment to GDP. Among countries for which 
      data are available, investment in knowledge is lowest in Mexico, Greece 
      and Portugal, at less than 2% of GDP. </P>
      <P>By this measure, most OECD countries are moving towards a 
      knowledge-based economy, especially the Nordic countries, Ireland and 
      Austria, which are allocating more and more resources to production of 
      knowledge. During the 1990s, investment in knowledge increased by 3.4% 
      annually in the OECD area, while gross fixed capital formation increased 
      by 2.2% annually. In the United States and Australia and in contrast to 
      most OECD countries, gross fixed capital formation grew more than 
      investment in knowledge; this could be due to the inclusion of some 
      component of investment in knowledge (such as software expenditure) in 
      gross fixed capital formation. </P>

            <H6>Measuring investment in knowledge </H6>
            <P>Total investment in knowledge is defined and calculated as the 
            sum of expenditure on R&amp;D, on total higher education from both 
            public and private sources and on software. Simple summation of the 
            three components would lead to overestimation of the investment in 
            knowledge owing to overlaps between the three components (R&amp;D 
            and software, R&amp;D and education, software and education). 
            Therefore, before calculating the total investment in knowledge, the 
            data required various transformations in order to derive figures 
            that meet the definition. </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>The R&amp;D component of higher education, which overlaps 
              R&amp;D expenditure, was estimated and subtracted from total 
              higher education expenditure (both public and private sources). 
              </P>
              <LI>
              <P>All expenditure on software cannot be considered investment. 
              Some is considered as consumption. Purchase of packaged software 
              by households and operational services in firms was estimated 
              using data from private sources and excluded. </P>
              <LI>
              <P>The software component of R&amp;D, which overlaps R&amp;D 
              expenditure, was estimated using information from national studies 
              and subtracted from software expenditure. </P>
              <LI>
              <P>Owing to a lack of information, it was not possible to separate 
              the overlap between education and software expenditure; however, 
              the available information indicates that the overlap is quite 
              small. </P></LI></UL>
            <P>A more complete picture of investment in knowledge would also 
            include other components. Owing to the lack of data availability, it 
            was not possible to include them: </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>Data relating to expenditure on the design of new goods are 
              collected from innovation surveys but are only available for a few 
              countries. The data for European countries are available for the 
              reference year 1996 only. </P>
              <LI>
              <P>Data on spending by enterprises on job-related training 
              programmes are scarce. </P>
              <LI>
              <P>Other components, such as spending on organisational change, 
              are even more difficult to estimate at this stage. </P></LI></UL>
            <P>Data relating to investment in knowledge were also reported in 
            the <I>1999 Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard</I>. 
            However, as a result of changes in methodology and availability of 
            additional data, figures on investment in knowledge reported here 
            should not be compared with those in the 1999 edition. </P>
